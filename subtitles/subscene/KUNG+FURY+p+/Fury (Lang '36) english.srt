1
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,768
What do you say, kid?
Are we moving in?

2
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:32,464
How many times
do you want me to say yes?

3
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,539
Every time you say it
is like the first time.

4
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:40,672
My heart starts beating
like I just ran around the block.

5
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:45,111
Those slippery rugs are out.
A guy could break his neck on those.

6
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,189
Mr. Wilson, do you plan
doing a lot of running around?

7
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:50,223
Yeah, after you.

8
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:52,657
- The rugs are out.
- And the twin beds too.

9
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,820
Out like a light.

10
00:01:54,998 --> 00:01:56,989
Hey, I like peanuts too.

11
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,533
- I thought you hated them.
- I did once.

12
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,670
What changed your mind?

13
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,329
I love you. You love peanuts.

14
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:06,532
I love peanuts too.

15
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,405
Well, I guess that wins.

16
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,846
It's raining.

17
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:16,508
Gee, it feels swell
against your face.

18
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,211
Tonight of all nights it's gotta rain.

19
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,550
Don't talk about it.

20
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,715
What am I gonna do
after you've gone?

21
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,758
Joe.

22
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:30,198
I'll be walking like this
down a street.

23
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:33,233
- Where are you?
- I'll be here.

24
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:03,064
Twenty cents.

25
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,099
- How do you like that?
- Oh, dear.

26
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,177
Here, give me.

27
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,477
Don't.

28
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:29,084
What are you gonna do?

29
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:31,318
Oh, here it is.

30
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,453
- Come on, I'll sew it.
- Here? No, no.

31
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,099
- You'll let it go. I know.
- Honest, I won't.

32
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,792
- You know you will.
- No, I'll sew it myself.

33
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,234
- I won't forget it, darling.
- Sit down.

34
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,199
Sit down.

35
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,437
There's a lot of people around.

36
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:58,281
Joe.

37
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,646
I've only got blue thread.

38
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:05,293
- Blue?
- Yep. Blue.

39
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:11,027
Train number 19 leaving for De Kalb.

40
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:15,034
- There. You hear? That's your train.
- That's not my train. Sit down.

41
00:04:16,472 --> 00:04:19,771
- I'm hard to get rid of.
- Like my right arm.

42
00:04:19,943 --> 00:04:22,503
Only I need you more.

43
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:25,639
Oh, Kat.

44
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,114
I'll come for you as soon
as I get that old bank account...

45
00:04:31,287 --> 00:04:34,484
...up to the third floor
and a kitchenette.

46
00:04:36,392 --> 00:04:38,383
This waiting is awful.

47
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,052
After all, we're human.

48
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,961
Why can't you stay
with your job here?

49
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,901
- At least we...
- We've been through that, darling.

50
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:55,704
There's a better job there,
and I'll be saving for us too.

51
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,710
I know.

52
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:10,553
Train number 27 leaving
for Galesburg and all points west.

53
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,693
- Give me some of those peanuts too.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,705
- How much for that "smellum"?
- That one there?

55
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:25,534
Take it easy on yourself now.

56
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,369
Four dollars.

57
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:30,103
Not for me, wise guy.
It's for a girl. How much?

58
00:05:30,313 --> 00:05:31,746
Five even.

59
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,853
I got you a little mementum.

60
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:42,786
"Memento," darling. "To," not "tum."

61
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,392
How often have I told you?

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,256
It's from wearing braces on my teeth
when I was a kid.

63
00:05:47,463 --> 00:05:50,364
You're still a kid. A lot of you is...

64
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:52,592
...and I love it.

65
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,396
I love you.

66
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,107
I got a memento for you too.

67
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,975
Look inside.

68
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:09,477
"Henry to Katherine."

69
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,621
It was my mother's wedding ring.
I was named after her.

70
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,451
So I...

71
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:21,056
- Turn it around.
- "Katherine to Joe."

72
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,629
Oh, Kat...

73
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:30,929
I guess I'll have to wear it
on my little finger.

74
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,601
All aboard!

75
00:06:39,882 --> 00:06:41,440
I'll come for you soon.

76
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:42,948
Soon, Joe.

77
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,984
Soon.

78
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,929
Hello, stranger.

79
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:41,470
Think you're smart, don't you?
How do you like this, big shot?

80
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,509
How's that?

81
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:47,740
You look the way I feel.

82
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,713
Lonely and small.

83
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,320
Come on.

84
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:56,991
Quiet.

85
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:03,391
That Charlie,
always leaving the light on.

86
00:08:29,725 --> 00:08:31,056
Straight ahead.

87
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,286
- Charlie, now, I'm all right.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

88
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,395
Come on, hold it now. Hold it.

89
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,629
- Charlie, where'd you get the dog?
- There's no dog. You're drunk.

90
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,802
- So you went to a movie?
- Hello, Joe.

91
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,712
- Katherine get away all right?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:50,913 --> 00:08:54,041
That's fine. I'm fine too.

93
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:01,379
I feel awful.

94
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:04,390
Now, listen, Charlie...

95
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,551
We had a couple drinks
after the show.

96
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:09,061
Kid's gotta have fun.
He just can't take it.

97
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:10,631
Who said I can't take it?

98
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,563
- I'm all right.
- All right, Tommy. Sure you are.

99
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:17,570
- All right, kid.
- Even Mr. Donelli said I was all right.

100
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,436
- Donelli?
- All right. I've been waiting for it.

101
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,807
Waiting for an undertaker or cops,
the life you're leading.

102
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,346
Running errands for that racketeer.

103
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:29,074
Let me tell you, Charlie,
leave Tom out of it.

104
00:09:29,252 --> 00:09:30,913
Joe, I know, I know.

105
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,647
We met Donelli,
and he invited us up for drinks.

106
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,518
Better Tom meets someone
who can do him some good.

107
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,592
Do him some good?

108
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:44,632
I'm glad Mom and Dad aren't here
to see the good you're doing yourself.

109
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,496
Can that Sunday-school talk.

110
00:09:48,437 --> 00:09:51,838
Think I'm gonna ride to heaven
on 30 a week from a sweatshop?

111
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,442
Be a working stiff all my life,
like you?

112
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,374
- Times have changed.
- You bet times have changed.

113
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,878
The people are against
you monkeys now.

114
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:02,448
The people ain't doing so good either.

115
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,643
I don't know what's so hot about you.

116
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:08,716
Crazy in love with a swell gal
and can't make enough to get married.

117
00:10:08,891 --> 00:10:12,691
- Leave Katherine out of it!
- Leave me out. Stop living my life.

118
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,830
I wouldn't live your life
for all the money in the world.

119
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,966
Okay, Reverend. Okay.

120
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,109
"Memento," darling. "Memento."

121
00:13:33,863 --> 00:13:35,831
Soon.

122
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,032
Come in.

123
00:13:40,202 --> 00:13:42,693
It's a special delivery
this time, Miss Grant.

124
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:44,897
- I hope nothing's happened.
- Oh, no.

125
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:50,706
They come faster than when I was a girl,
but I guess the insides don't change.

126
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,576
- He's coming, Mrs. Whipple!
- No.

127
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,015
Wedding, marriage license.

128
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,677
He's bought a car.

129
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,413
Look.

130
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:08,758
- Be sure and kiss Katherine for me.
- Happy landings, fella.

131
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,923
Don't let the Indians
get you out there.

132
00:14:13,035 --> 00:14:15,595
You keep your chin clean.
Look after the kid.

133
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,831
You can trust me.
Rainbow, take care of Joe.

134
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:21,967
- Goodbye, boys.
- So long, Joe.

135
00:14:22,144 --> 00:14:24,442
- Is there gas in it? Bye-bye.
- All right.

136
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:42,958
War and crime.

137
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,395
Strikes, taxes.

138
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:49,004
And some weenies for his dog
and an avocado for him.

139
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:53,505
They call them alligator pears back East,
cost a fortune. Think he'll like them?

140
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:56,736
He won't know what he's eating
for being with you again.

141
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,675
What time will I make lunch for?

142
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:01,941
I'm leaving for Sycamore Corners
by bus on the main road.

143
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:05,575
I wrote him to meet me there
at 11:00 at that hot dog stand.

144
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,018
We'll be back by noon sure.

145
00:15:08,757 --> 00:15:11,885
Golly, Mrs. Whipple,
I can hardly stand it.

146
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,927
Over a year now.

147
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:26,332
Stop your motor, buddy.

148
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,204
Get both hands up
on that wheel there.

149
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:31,510
What is this, a holdup?

150
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,945
- No grass growing under them tires, eh?
- I wasn't speeding.

151
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:38,052
- And Illinois license plates?
- Yeah, sure. Chicago.

152
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,812
Get that fist up there.

153
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:43,186
Hey, I haven't got any gun
if that's what you mean.

154
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,623
- Peanuts won't kill you.
- Salted peanuts?

155
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:48,820
- Yeah, why?
- I ain't answering the questions, buddy.

156
00:15:48,998 --> 00:15:50,727
You are. Come on, get out.

157
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,030
Where were you last night,
Mr. Wilson?

158
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,729
If you don't mind.

159
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,170
- I drove all night.
- On that old road?

160
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,175
I got lost trying to find
a shortcut to Capital City.

161
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,973
- And the night before last?
- Camping out.

162
00:16:06,148 --> 00:16:11,051
Sorry to take up so much of your time,
but... Excuse me a second.

163
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,324
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

164
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,730
Some peanuts?

165
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,169
Now you're talking
my language, sheriff.

166
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,335
I've had that habit
since I was a kid.

167
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:42,313
My old man used to bring them to me.
I got used to having them around.

168
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,848
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:44,053 --> 00:16:46,988
- Always find peanuts in my pocket.
- Wilson...

170
00:16:47,156 --> 00:16:50,023
...where did you say
you spent the night before last?

171
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:52,592
- Camping out.
- Why?

172
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,252
Why? For the...

173
00:16:55,931 --> 00:17:00,334
Is it a crime to get fresh air for yourself
when you've been stuck in a ci...?

174
00:17:01,003 --> 00:17:04,131
Hey, look. What am I
suspected of anyway?

175
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:07,639
- I got a right to know.
- Sure.

176
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:17,077
Me? Why, that's the craziest thing
I ever heard. That'd fit a million men.

177
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,789
Read that.

178
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,623
Am I the only guy in the world
that eats peanuts?

179
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:33,393
- Why, you just...
- I never ate peanuts in my life.

180
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,804
I get it.

181
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,968
Why don't you check?
Get my brothers on the phone...

182
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,307
...in Chicago...
- We'll check all right.

183
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,746
That's what I'm here for.

184
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,250
- Mind showing me your pockets?
- I should say not.

185
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,720
I don't mind, I mean.
He knows what I got.

186
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,985
Keys, handkerchiefs...

187
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,192
...my license, money,
what there is of it.

188
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:07,028
Pipe, tobacco, matches.

189
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:11,236
- And peanuts.
- Bugs.

190
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,873
- Quiet, Rainbow.
- Check those bills...

191
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,707
...against the numbers
of these ransom banknotes.

192
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:23,181
You've come to the right man, chief.

193
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:28,551
- Sure he's only gonna check those?
- You're probably right as rain, Wilson.

194
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:36,026
Take a look under the five-dollar series.
Q 49677308 Z.

195
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,258
And on his bill the same thing.
Q 49677308 Z.

196
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:41,299
That can't be. That's impossible.

197
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,961
Rip up that car of his.
Might be more of them.

198
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,802
- Man, is this gonna be a sensation.
- Keep it to yourself.

199
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:50,672
And keep that dog quiet.

200
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,673
- Good morning.
- Hello.

201
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,587
Anybody here?

202
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:10,755
Any good-looking man from Illinois
looking for a good-looking girl here?

203
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:14,334
- Where's the good-looking girl?
- She'll be along in a minute.

204
00:19:14,503 --> 00:19:17,836
Well, the good-looking
young fella ain't here yet either.

205
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:20,099
He will be.

206
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:23,642
Well, will you let me
phone Chicago then?

207
00:19:25,614 --> 00:19:27,138
Or better, I can phone my...

208
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:31,445
- Phone your what?
- Phone my brothers.

209
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,681
If you're mixed up with this gang,
it wouldn't be smart of me to let you.

210
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:40,352
Look, sheriff. I got the bill some place
in change. I don't know where I got it.

211
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:43,692
Maybe I got it at a store
or a gas station or some place.

212
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,334
Take me back over the road.
I can prove...

213
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:48,935
Not a thing in the car. Not a thing.

214
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:53,131
Take care of this stranger, Frank.
Go through his clothes.

215
00:19:53,308 --> 00:19:56,243
Sure you haven't forgot anything,
Wilson?

216
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,980
Yeah.

217
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,876
There's my watch.

218
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,644
The ring. It's too tight. I can't get it off.
Cut it off. Why not?

219
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,812
I've gotta hold you, Wilson,
for the district attorney.

220
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,323
But you'll get a square deal.

221
00:20:11,526 --> 00:20:13,756
- Come on.
- You can type that now, Myrtle.

222
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:18,162
Quiet, Rainbow.

223
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,200
- She'll be all right, sheriff.
- Okay.

224
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,840
- Looks like we got ahold of something.
- Yeah.

225
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,979
- Be at the barbershop if you want me.
- Okay.

226
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,809
Let me tell you, professor, if you
young geniuses at the high school...

227
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,645
...fill our children's heads
with radical ideas...

228
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:41,721
...we parents will have to get a law.
- Not possible to get a law...

229
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,690
...that denies the right to say what
one believes, in peace times anyway.

230
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,887
- Who says so?
- The Constitution of the United States.

231
00:20:49,064 --> 00:20:50,861
I don't believe it.

232
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:53,934
You should read it sometime.
You would be surprised.

233
00:20:54,102 --> 00:20:56,195
Well, that's enough
of that now, Sven.

234
00:20:56,371 --> 00:20:58,896
I had to read it
to become an American.

235
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:02,100
You never had to
because you was born here.

236
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:06,842
Hello, Meyers? Anything new
on this awful Peabody case?

237
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,878
I don't know.

238
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:14,749
You public servants quit playing cards.
Maybe you'd bring somebody to justice.

239
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:18,286
What'd you say if I raked in
a guy this morning...

240
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,759
...might know something
about them kidnappers? Yeah.

241
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,458
What do you suppose it is makes people
do things like snatching that kid?

242
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,694
Nutty, I guess.

243
00:21:30,973 --> 00:21:32,770
Now, I'll tell you.

244
00:21:32,941 --> 00:21:35,409
People get funny impulses.

245
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:38,478
If you resist them, you're sane...

246
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:43,141
...if you don't, you're on your way
to the nuthouse or the pen.

247
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,321
At the taxpayers' expense.

248
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:51,983
Mr. Jorganson, you've got one
of the levelest heads in the county.

249
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,824
Would you believe that in the 20 years
that I've been stroking this razor...

250
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,990
...across throats here...

251
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:02,898
...that many a time
I've had an impulse...

252
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,940
...to cut their
Adam's apples wide open?

253
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,475
Just like that.

254
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,141
Yes, sir.

255
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:21,988
How about it, Hec?
Do you feel an impulse coming on?

256
00:22:24,459 --> 00:22:27,758
An impulse is an impulse.

257
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,025
It's like an itch. You gotta scratch it.

258
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,349
Hello?

259
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,112
What's that, Hector?

260
00:22:53,388 --> 00:22:55,151
My oldest customer.

261
00:22:55,323 --> 00:22:58,781
All on account of that Bugs Meyers
from the sheriff's office...

262
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,986
...telling a cock-and-bull story
about his capturing...

263
00:23:02,164 --> 00:23:07,067
...one of that Peabody kidnapping gang.
- I got something on the stove, precious.

264
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:10,068
Call you back. Bye-bye.

265
00:23:16,344 --> 00:23:18,676
Mrs. Tuttle! Mrs. Tuttle!

266
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,247
- Of all things.
- For mercy's sake, what is it?

267
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,419
Just wait. My husband phoned me.
They've arrested a man.

268
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:27,953
And they think he's
one of the kidnappers.

269
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,597
Fanny!

270
00:23:39,768 --> 00:23:44,068
That barber's wife says this morning
they caught a man on the old road...

271
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:48,573
...who they suspect knows
something about this kidnapping.

272
00:23:48,743 --> 00:23:52,338
I got it on the highest authority
that they arrested...

273
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,449
...one of that kidnapping gang.
- You don't say.

274
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,518
He tried to escape,
but they captured him all right.

275
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,178
- Oh, I'll have three of those.
- Oh, come on.

276
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,756
- And a pound of prunes.
- What's his name?

277
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:06,086
- Who was he?
- What else?

278
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:10,425
Well, I can't tell you any more. It was
told me in the strictest confidence.

279
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,794
Fanny, that isn't fair.
Please. Come on.

280
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:17,370
But, darling, you know
I'm as silent as a tomb.

281
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,909
But are you sure he's not innocent?

282
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,140
My dear young woman,
in this country...

283
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:32,252
...people don't land in jail
unless they're guilty.

284
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,883
My wife's sister called up and told her
that a friend of hers told her...

285
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,494
...that this guy acted
as cocky as a bronco.

286
00:24:41,663 --> 00:24:44,632
All he'd answer was,
"Let me phone my lawyer."

287
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,632
Sure. That's the racket
of those bigtime attorneys.

288
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,633
Helping these skunks beat the law.

289
00:24:49,804 --> 00:24:52,568
Well, they won't beat it
with any jury I'm ever on.

290
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,676
If all us people had the courage
of our convictions...

291
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:59,974
...these vermin would vanish
like spit on a hot stove.

292
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,988
Set them up for the boys, Oscar.

293
00:25:13,795 --> 00:25:15,262
Four beers.

294
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,990
Last time after you played
that slot machine...

295
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,259
...it was full of telephone slugs.

296
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,198
Now, ain't that a shame.

297
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:24,368
Say, Dawson...

298
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:27,872
...I hear they gave that guy
your favorite cell at the jail.

299
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:30,704
Next time I'm in,
it'll be for beating you up.

300
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:32,779
All right, big shot.

301
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,881
While I didn't vote
for Hummel for sheriff...

302
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:39,349
...his promptness in catching
this kidnapper is commendable.

303
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,457
They can't bring him to trial
any too quickly to suit me.

304
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:47,120
- Lf you don't mind.
- Well, excuse me for living.

305
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,786
- Mr. Pippen.
- Hello, George.

306
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,991
- I have some fine, new English flannel.
- Later, Durkin.

307
00:25:53,168 --> 00:25:56,035
- Yes, as you wish.
- My usual, Oscar.

308
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:59,833
We were discussing down
at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon...

309
00:26:00,008 --> 00:26:05,036
We were discussing at the luncheon
about what a great publicity break...

310
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:09,806
What a great publicity break
our capturing this Chicago fellow...

311
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:15,389
...is gonna give our little city, assuming
of course the citizens, leading citizens...

312
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,590
See that he's brought to justice.

313
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:22,252
We'll take care of that,
all right, all right.

314
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,694
We'll go to the sheriff,
get it from him.

315
00:26:24,866 --> 00:26:27,858
Boys, that's a great idea.
I'll go with you.

316
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:32,004
Hey! Hey, jailer.

317
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,937
- Has the sheriff phoned my brothers yet?
- I don't know.

318
00:26:35,143 --> 00:26:39,546
But you'll hear something
one way or the other in due time.

319
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:51,183
I'm trying to locate the district attorney.
We'll get the truth as soon as possible.

320
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,385
But till we do, one way or other...

321
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:57,053
...l've no right to make a statement.

322
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:59,699
Ordinarily, sheriff, yes.

323
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,063
But there's a nervous
feeling about town.

324
00:27:02,304 --> 00:27:03,999
Yes, sheriff.

325
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:06,163
And the community feels that...

326
00:27:06,341 --> 00:27:08,206
We got a right to know
about him.

327
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,244
I don't know yet that he is
a kidnapper, so neither do you.

328
00:27:12,414 --> 00:27:14,905
What are you trying to do, Hummel?

329
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,917
- Protect this weasel?
- That's pretty comical, you cockroach.

330
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:21,146
You teaching me law and order.

331
00:27:21,323 --> 00:27:24,815
You've been stirrings up trouble
for law and order hereabouts...

332
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:27,689
...ever since you put on long pants.

333
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:32,829
Anything more I can do
for you gentlemen?

334
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:35,265
Here, let me talk.
No offense meant.

335
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:39,999
I'm sure, sheriff, we can count on you
keeping everything shipshape, I'm sure.

336
00:27:40,175 --> 00:27:41,540
Good afternoon.

337
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,871
But I would like to...

338
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,608
Good day, sheriff.

339
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:50,879
- Goodbye, sheriff.
- Well, good day.

340
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:56,290
It's an outrage a man can't stand up
for law and order...

341
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,187
Men do stand up for it.

342
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,921
I'll tell you one thing, Hummel.
My friends won't be satisfied...

343
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:05,260
...with what those pillars
of society have to tell them.

344
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,596
An attack on a girl hits us
ordinary people where we live.

345
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,398
We're gonna see that politics
don't cut any ice.

346
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:15,873
I'm gonna see that a lot
of half-baked rumors don't either.

347
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:20,242
Now hightail out of here
and behave yourself...

348
00:28:20,415 --> 00:28:25,717
...or I'll have the county take you
and all your relatives off the dole.

349
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:10,762
Myrtle, get the governor
on the phone.

350
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:15,835
I'll have the National Guard ready
for any merited emergency.

351
00:29:16,037 --> 00:29:18,028
Oh, I'm sure you will.

352
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:19,901
Keep me informed.

353
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,539
I hope nothing's happened.
It's the first time he's come West, so...

354
00:29:25,713 --> 00:29:29,706
I ain't heard of anyone being tomahawked
or scalped in the neighborhood in a while.

355
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,785
The sheriff's wrong
not to give us the facts.

356
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:36,320
What'd they rip his car up for
unless it was to find ransom dough?

357
00:29:36,491 --> 00:29:39,392
I heard there was 5000
in tens, twenties, fifties...

358
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,553
- Ten thousand, they told me.
- It was a lot of money.

359
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,722
First thing he did was phone
Chicago for his lawyer.

360
00:29:45,934 --> 00:29:48,869
That's always the first thing
a guy like that will do.

361
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:54,636
Maybe he gave the money
to the sheriff to go free on bail.

362
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,744
- Shut up, Goofy.
- There's Bugs. He ought to know.

363
00:29:57,946 --> 00:29:59,470
- Let's ask.
- That's an idea.

364
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:03,743
- Bring him in and give him a drink.
- Come on, gang. Let's go and get him.

365
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:14,491
Remember, just one.

366
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,094
Hooray for Bugsy!

367
00:30:21,369 --> 00:30:23,564
- Give us the dope, Bugsy.
- Come on, Bugs.

368
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,901
- He knows all about it.
- Say, what's biting you fellas?

369
00:30:27,108 --> 00:30:30,043
- What do you wanna know?
- There's an argument about...

370
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:34,170
...the amount the sheriff
found in that kidnapper's car.

371
00:30:35,283 --> 00:30:37,877
- I hate to disappoint you guys.
- Come on, Bugsy.

372
00:30:38,052 --> 00:30:40,714
We didn't find nothing.
We ripped it up...

373
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:42,982
Go on, we know
you found ransom money.

374
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:48,458
- Yeah, ten grand hid under the seat.
- Ten grand, me eye.

375
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:52,464
Why, all Wilson had on him of
the ransom money was a five-dollar bill.

376
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,465
Who does that make a liar out of?

377
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,070
Wait'll I shove it down
the sheriff's throat.

378
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,069
Come on.
Let's give him a serenade.

379
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,640
- Yeah, Dawson's right.
- Attaboy!

380
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:11,542
Quiet. Quiet, I say! Quiet!

381
00:31:11,719 --> 00:31:14,244
Everybody's getting too excited.

382
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,447
The sheriff's okay.

383
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,455
- This is none of our business.
- No?

384
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:22,153
I'll tell you, if I lived in this town,
I'd make it my business.

385
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,888
What are you eggs?

386
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:28,434
Soft-boiled, that you don't
stick up for a kidnapped girl?

387
00:31:28,603 --> 00:31:31,163
- Who are you?
- Just passing through.

388
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:35,105
Been up to Capital City, strike-breaking
for the streetcar company.

389
00:31:35,276 --> 00:31:38,404
Maybe you need some help here too.

390
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,945
Not from a mug like you.

391
00:31:40,114 --> 00:31:43,277
Lay off, Garrett. The sheriff made
a monkey out of you too.

392
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:48,150
He's right. We ought to be ashamed
letting a stranger show us the ropes.

393
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:53,190
Come on, fellas, let's go get him.
Come on!

394
00:32:00,935 --> 00:32:03,802
Come on, let's have some fun!

395
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:37,069
Where's that special deputy list
I made out?

396
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:41,402
Did I tell you to call up the gov...?
Wait a minute.

397
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:48,040
Here, Myrtle, first call up
the men I've checked on that list.

398
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,717
Get out the tear gas bombs.

399
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,048
- Two apiece.
- Right.

400
00:33:35,663 --> 00:33:38,598
Sheriff, we wanna talk
to this Wilson guy.

401
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:45,804
Boys, keep out of this.

402
00:33:45,973 --> 00:33:50,376
There's no positive proof
that the man you want to...

403
00:33:50,545 --> 00:33:53,446
...talk to is guilty.

404
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,141
Or innocent either.

405
00:33:56,317 --> 00:33:58,808
The district attorney
is checking on him now.

406
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:01,113
But whichever he is...

407
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,281
...he's under the protection
of the law.

408
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:14,632
As long as I stand here
you can yell yourselves hoarse.

409
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:18,135
- But you won't see this man.
- Then you won't stand there long.

410
00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:20,466
We'll move you.

411
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:24,144
Well, then I ought to tell you men...

412
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,644
...the National Guard is on its way.

413
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:33,185
Orders to stop,
telephoned from the governor.

414
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:36,414
- Stop? But...
- Why, Will?

415
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,459
Because people always resent
troops moving in on them.

416
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:42,926
Hurts their pride.

417
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:46,856
When the papers phoned me
about this little ruckus in Strand...

418
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:49,366
...I was able to calm them
down all right.

419
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:53,701
But knowing how conscientious
you are, Bert, I came right over.

420
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:56,867
And mighty good thing
I was in time to stop you too.

421
00:34:57,545 --> 00:35:01,879
You could cut our political throats
with this soldier stuff in an election year.

422
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:08,453
You, Freddy Garrett, Durkin, Lopez,
Walker, Johnson, all of you, go home.

423
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:12,055
You're gonna wind up being sorry
for this.

424
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:14,984
Think of your families.

425
00:35:15,496 --> 00:35:19,990
Stick in with this kidnapper, Milt Grimes,
and you'd better not come home tonight.

426
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,566
You elected me to do my duty,
and I'm going to.

427
00:35:29,143 --> 00:35:33,170
You're diving in over your heads, men.
Listen to reason.

428
00:35:33,347 --> 00:35:36,407
Stop acting like a lot of hysterical...

429
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,148
I'm warning you!
Don't make me use force.

430
00:35:42,323 --> 00:35:44,587
You're not up against just us here.

431
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:48,660
- More deputies, with tear gas and rifles...
- Hey!

432
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:58,835
Hey, jailer! Jailer! Come here, will you?
Hey, jailer!

433
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:01,908
Jailer!

434
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,738
Jailer! Have the sheriff inform
my girl, will you?

435
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,743
She's the one I wanted to call up.

436
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,883
I just didn't wanna get her
mixed up in this thing.

437
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:11,575
She can tell you who I am.

438
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,023
Ten cents.

439
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:32,571
Hey, buddy! Hey!

440
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,435
Hey, is this the way to Strand?

441
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,908
- Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks. Keep going.

442
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,584
Them newsreel guys are on their toes.
Must have found out before it happened.

443
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:50,154
I phoned where I live.
There's no word of him.

444
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,455
Oh, he had a puncture, I suppose.
Everything will be all right.

445
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,922
The things that happen.
The bus driver just told me...

446
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:03,935
...they got somebody they suspect
of that kidnapping at Strand.

447
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,471
A fella named Joe Wilson.

448
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,973
The mob there is trying
to make him confess.

449
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,373
Joe Wilson? But...

450
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,006
Joe... That's impossible.

451
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:17,275
He never hurt a hair on anyone's head
in his life.

452
00:37:17,451 --> 00:37:23,151
Where's a car? I've got to go there.
Lend me your car, please? I've got to go.

453
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,656
- The boys got my car.
- When's the next bus?

454
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,090
They ain't no more.

455
00:37:30,898 --> 00:37:35,597
What'll I do? I've got to go.

456
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:40,334
Don't you understand?
I've got to go to him.

457
00:37:40,975 --> 00:37:42,840
Won't you help me?

458
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:54,215
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
what a shot this is.

459
00:37:54,422 --> 00:37:56,617
We'll sweep the country
with this stuff.

460
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,851
Oh, the film's gone. Reload.

461
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,996
And be sure and use
that hypersensitive film.

462
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:04,791
Holy smoke.

463
00:38:04,966 --> 00:38:09,062
Come on, Bill, make it snappy.
And get me that 2-inch lens.

464
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:13,564
Bar the door.

465
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:17,667
Open the door!

466
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:20,336
I can get them through the window.

467
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:22,175
- More bombs!
- We're almost out.

468
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,375
- Where's them National Guards?
- Where's Ralph?

469
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,883
- Here.
- Where's Milt?

470
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,216
- His wife took him home.
- Why, the yellow...

471
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:33,225
Wait a minute.

472
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:37,096
What does that silence mean? Quiet.

473
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,695
<i>Heave ho!</i>

474
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,394
<i>Heave ho! Heave...</i>

475
00:38:45,606 --> 00:38:48,666
Get cabinets, desks,
line them up against that door.

476
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,603
Stop! Please, stop!

477
00:38:56,117 --> 00:39:00,713
Jailer! Jailer! Can't anybody hear me?
Let me out!

478
00:39:01,222 --> 00:39:02,849
I'll talk to them!

479
00:39:03,024 --> 00:39:05,515
Let me out! Give me a chance!

480
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:09,595
Let me talk to them!
Give me a chance, will you?

481
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,993
Can't anybody hear me?

482
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:44,957
- Up to the cells, men.
- Come on!

483
00:39:48,769 --> 00:39:50,999
- Give us the keys, Lem.
- I ain't got them.

484
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:54,903
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.
- All we want is this guy Wilson.

485
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:57,168
- We know you got keys.
- I ain't got them!

486
00:39:57,411 --> 00:39:59,811
- We want those keys.
- Where are they?

487
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,254
- Get a post. We'll break it down!
- Yeah, that's it!

488
00:40:12,426 --> 00:40:15,259
We haven't got time.
Let's smoke him out.

489
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,990
Yeah, he's right. Let's go, men.
Come on, let's get some wood.

490
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:27,196
Hope you like baked potatoes, Wilson.

491
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:30,639
- Hey!
- There goes his dog!

492
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:33,473
- Give me some of them books.
- Hey, come back here!

493
00:40:33,647 --> 00:40:35,274
- Let the dog go!
- Get it down!

494
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:38,714
Hey, Wilson, they can't parole you
out of this.

495
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,451
Hello, Rainbow.

496
00:40:42,656 --> 00:40:45,625
Let him have it. Take it away.

497
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,569
Looks bad, Rainbow.

498
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,309
Looks bad.

499
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,379
There he is!

500
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:05,370
I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord.

501
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:09,134
I am a stranger with thee
and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

502
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,337
God forgive him and our trespasses, as
we forgive them who trespass against us.

503
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,005
Run in back, Wilson. Get back there!

504
00:42:16,183 --> 00:42:18,515
What are you looking for,
the Peabody girl?

505
00:42:18,686 --> 00:42:20,017
Get back!

506
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,160
No.

507
00:42:37,404 --> 00:42:39,497
Jiggers! The soldiers are coming!

508
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:41,038
Soldiers!

509
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,011
- Let's beat it.
- Wait! I've got an idea.

510
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,677
- They'll never get him out.
- That's the stuff.

511
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:58,154
After this dynamite,
they won't be able to find the jail.

512
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,053
Wait! Here's somebody!

513
00:43:02,229 --> 00:43:03,890
Help her up!

514
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:16,407
Why, the very spirit of government
has been violated.

515
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:19,068
The state disgraced in the eyes
of the world...

516
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,374
...by this brutal outburst
of lust for vengeance.

517
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:23,982
And I blame myself.

518
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,947
I let you talk me down.

519
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,556
That mob could have been stopped
if assistance had been sent...

520
00:43:29,723 --> 00:43:31,714
...to officers in time.
- Forget it.

521
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:36,295
The reformers will cuss around for a while
and then start cussing something else.

522
00:43:38,299 --> 00:43:41,632
These letters and telegrams backing up
the statement I gave.

523
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:43,929
Congratulations, 90 percent of them.

524
00:43:44,104 --> 00:43:46,436
"Finest thing we've heard of in years."

525
00:43:46,607 --> 00:43:48,006
"Congratulations."

526
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,574
I wonder what sort of telegrams
we'll get...

527
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:53,508
...when it's known that Wilson
was an innocent man.

528
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,275
Well, when I gave out the statement
I didn't know that.

529
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:04,580
This story is on every wire
in the world right now.

530
00:44:09,463 --> 00:44:13,524
Yeah, yeah.
Now he's innocent. Yeah.

531
00:44:16,103 --> 00:44:19,664
I can't get it out of my head.
I can't get any sleep.

532
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,240
When I close my eyes, I...

533
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:36,646
I can't understand why we haven't
heard from Katherine.

534
00:44:36,824 --> 00:44:38,291
She's like all the rest.

535
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:41,826
He gets in trouble,
and she takes a run-out powder.

536
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:46,158
When I think how happy he was
when he left here...

537
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,164
Oh, stop it!

538
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:04,715
Hey, what are you doing here?

539
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:09,682
You better go back.

540
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:20,197
- Any of that milk left, Tom?
- What?

541
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:22,265
Oh, yes.

542
00:45:22,436 --> 00:45:24,597
There. Come back over here.

543
00:45:25,672 --> 00:45:27,230
Here.

544
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:38,077
If I could only get at them rats.
If I could only get my hands on them.

545
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:41,119
We're going out there, Tom.
We're gonna get them.

546
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:45,223
- Kill them the way they killed Joe.
- Whatever you say. And whenever.

547
00:45:45,392 --> 00:45:48,259
That's five-and-ten-cent store talk.

548
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:52,361
Joe!

549
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,933
Joe.

550
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:04,407
Pull down that shade.

551
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:07,140
Pull down the shade!

552
00:46:19,993 --> 00:46:21,654
Turn out that light!

553
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:39,276
You know where I've been all day?

554
00:46:39,446 --> 00:46:41,778
In a movie.

555
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:47,681
Watching a newsreel of myself
getting burned alive.

556
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:51,118
I watched it 10 times or 20 maybe.

557
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:54,385
Over and over again.
I don't know how much.

558
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:57,357
The place was packed. They like it.

559
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:02,491
They get a big kick out of seeing a man
burned to death. A big kick!

560
00:47:05,172 --> 00:47:06,901
What an explosion.

561
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:12,308
It blew the cell door off,
and it killed...

562
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:14,504
...Rainbow.

563
00:47:17,017 --> 00:47:19,645
I got out down a rain-pipe.

564
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:23,021
I almost burned my side off.

565
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,216
I could smell myself burn!

566
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:30,863
- It's awful. I feel like thanking God.
- Did you get burned bad?

567
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:34,228
That don't hurt me.
You can't hurt a dead man and I'm dead.

568
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,562
Everybody knows that.
The whole country. I'm dead, see.

569
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:40,229
You remember me preaching to you
to live right?

570
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,035
Live right. I tried it. I tried to like it.

571
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:46,304
And people... But they won't let you!

572
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,382
You were right. Donelli was right.
Everyone was right but me. I was wrong.

573
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:51,984
I know now. I'll get them.

574
00:47:52,152 --> 00:47:56,054
- We'll get a lawyer and have them...
- Arrested for disturbing the peace?

575
00:47:56,223 --> 00:47:59,715
For setting fire to a jail, maybe?
No, that's not enough for me.

576
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:02,259
I'm burned to death
by a mob of animals.

577
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,828
I'm legally dead.
They're legally murderers.

578
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:06,829
That I'm alive is not their fault.

579
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,434
But I know them.
I know a lot of them.

580
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:11,002
And they'll hang for it.

581
00:48:11,171 --> 00:48:14,163
According to the law which says
if you kill somebody...

582
00:48:14,341 --> 00:48:16,104
...you gotta be killed yourself.

583
00:48:16,276 --> 00:48:18,904
I'll give them the chance
they didn't give me.

584
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,276
They'll get a legal trial
in a legal courtroom.

585
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:25,280
They'll have a legal judge
and a legal defense.

586
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:29,421
They'll get a legal sentence
and a legal death.

587
00:48:34,528 --> 00:48:36,792
But I can't do it myself.

588
00:48:37,698 --> 00:48:40,064
You'll have to do it for me.

589
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,066
You see that?

590
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,531
I tore it out of a law book.

591
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:58,480
My husband says it would be a blessing
if the community would forget...

592
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:00,279
...what happened.

593
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:04,220
It just leaves a bad taste,
and it reminds everyone of what...

594
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:11,330
...as the minister said Sunday,
would be better forgiven and forgotten.

595
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,528
The mailman was just here.

596
00:49:17,804 --> 00:49:19,635
Shall I go?

597
00:49:20,907 --> 00:49:23,432
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

598
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,811
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Garrett.
Come in.

599
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:32,345
Have you heard anything
from the hotel?

600
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,749
Fred's been down at that investigation
for so long.

601
00:49:35,922 --> 00:49:40,120
I wondered if your husband had phoned,
or anything.

602
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:44,027
There, there. Don't worry,
Mrs. Garrett, don't worry.

603
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:48,930
Nobody's going to cut off their nose to
spite their face, naming names in this...

604
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:52,094
I know, but if somebody does talk,
then what'll happen?

605
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:54,467
Nobody's going to talk.

606
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:58,800
The responsible businessmen
have decided it's a community...

607
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:00,776
...and not an individual thing.

608
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:05,316
So everybody's got to stick together
against this district attorney.

609
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,647
The whole town's tongue-tied.
Under wraps.

610
00:50:08,822 --> 00:50:11,313
- Protecting its own, naturally.
- Ask anybody!

611
00:50:11,491 --> 00:50:13,356
They'll tell you Joe was there.

612
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:15,791
Before I can charge anybody
with murder...

613
00:50:15,962 --> 00:50:18,192
...I have to prove a murder
was committed.

614
00:50:18,365 --> 00:50:21,232
And I can't even find anyone who will
swear...

615
00:50:21,401 --> 00:50:25,997
...that at the time the jail burned,
your brother was in it at all.

616
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,908
Sorry, boys, but I've got to go
back tonight.

617
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,409
Come on, I don't believe she ran out
on him.

618
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:38,050
We got an hour till train time, so we
might as well try. We can ask, anyway.

619
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:42,752
I'll do the talking.

620
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:47,357
Miss Grant live here?

621
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:49,757
She's very sick.
She can't talk to anyone.

622
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:54,196
- Our name's Wilson. We're...
- Oh, his brothers. Come in, come in.

623
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:08,508
Hello, Katherine.

624
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:11,784
Katherine!

625
00:51:14,421 --> 00:51:17,356
- It's Charlie.
- And Tom.

626
00:51:18,692 --> 00:51:22,059
This is the way she's been ever since
she came home.

627
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:25,027
Katherine, don't you remember us?

628
00:51:25,198 --> 00:51:27,063
We came from Joe...

629
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:31,299
We're Joe's brothers.
Joe, Katherine.

630
00:51:31,471 --> 00:51:34,736
You see? It's the same as ev...

631
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:38,435
Land sakes! Excuse me a second.
I've got broth on the stove.

632
00:51:41,615 --> 00:51:44,641
Charlie, look. She is sick.

633
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:47,150
- Lf we tell her Joe's all right...
- Shut up!

634
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:50,983
She can't hear. But it's not fair
to her not to know. It might help.

635
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,752
No, no. Let me think.

636
00:52:04,805 --> 00:52:07,433
No. No! No!

637
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,634
Joe! Joe!

638
00:52:11,812 --> 00:52:15,976
No, it's Charlie.
Charlie, Katherine, and Tom.

639
00:52:16,149 --> 00:52:17,673
What is...?

640
00:52:17,851 --> 00:52:23,153
Joe's brothers. Try and remember,
Katherine. Joe's brothers.

641
00:52:25,158 --> 00:52:26,750
Charlie?

642
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,495
Tom?

643
00:52:37,604 --> 00:52:39,629
Oh, Charlie...

644
00:52:39,806 --> 00:52:41,637
...I saw him.

645
00:52:42,776 --> 00:52:44,971
I saw him...

646
00:52:45,612 --> 00:52:47,944
...behind those flames...

647
00:52:48,648 --> 00:52:51,139
...in that burning jail.

648
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:53,950
His face.

649
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:57,283
There, dear heart, it's all over now.

650
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:01,253
The witness.

651
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:05,788
I'll make them suffer.
I'll get them now, all right.

652
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:09,834
Why'd you have to come to Capital City?
Why didn't you stay in Chicago?

653
00:53:10,003 --> 00:53:13,302
Your picture will be in the papers.
Somebody will see you.

654
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:17,204
Nobody will see me because I'll be
hiding. I had to be on the scene.

655
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:20,505
Did you think I was going to wait
for letters from you?

656
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,208
I think Joe's right. It's natural, wanting
to hear everything as soon as possible.

657
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:28,252
- Maybe he'll wanna see Katherine.
- Get this straight!

658
00:53:28,421 --> 00:53:32,414
Katherine's not to know I'm alive.
She'd crack. Never go through with it.

659
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,924
She wouldn't see things
the way I see them.

660
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:39,422
I wanna hear everything they say.

661
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,227
I wanna see them squirm
the way they made me.

662
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:44,370
I wanna see them
at the end of a rope.

663
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:48,068
Adams, I've got to hold this party
together in this state.

664
00:53:48,241 --> 00:53:52,735
These star-spangled heroics of yours
will blow it a mile high.

665
00:53:52,913 --> 00:53:57,714
I've got to proceed with this case
as my oath of office requires.

666
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:02,452
You and your wife
and that boy of yours...

667
00:54:02,622 --> 00:54:05,386
Adams, you like to eat, don't you?

668
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:07,583
Sure, Will.

669
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:11,356
But some of the things people have had
to eat in this country lately...

670
00:54:11,531 --> 00:54:14,022
...haven't agreed with their stomachs.
- But...

671
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,031
Well, who are you going to name?

672
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:18,727
You can't bring a town
full of John Does to trial...

673
00:54:18,905 --> 00:54:21,874
...just to pull yourself
to heaven on a publicity stunt.

674
00:54:22,976 --> 00:54:28,039
John Doe is not going to trial, Will...

675
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:31,706
...but 22 citizens of Strand...

676
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:37,118
...who I can prove are guilty of murder
in the first degree.

677
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:39,918
Because the law declares
that in a lynching...

678
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:43,961
...all who consent to the design
are responsible for what took place.

679
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,566
All who participate
are responsible for the act.

680
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:49,758
This may seem harsh...

681
00:54:49,936 --> 00:54:53,064
...but when a mob takes it upon itself...

682
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:57,869
...to identify, try, condemn and punish...

683
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:04,281
...it is a destroyer of a government that
patriots died to establish and defend.

684
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:08,182
Every decent person in the country
feels the importance of this case.

685
00:55:08,421 --> 00:55:11,288
The nation is hanging on the outcome
of this trial.

686
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:15,292
<i>No lynching can be justified,</i>
<i>though sometimes attempts are made...</i>

687
00:55:15,462 --> 00:55:19,091
<i>... to whitewash them by citing</i>
<i>the confessions of...</i>

688
00:55:19,299 --> 00:55:23,861
<i>... or proofs of guilt against,</i>
<i>the by now silent corpse.</i>

689
00:55:24,037 --> 00:55:29,100
<i>But no one can dare defend the lynching</i>
<i>of an innocent man.</i>

690
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:34,338
<i>American democracy and its system</i>
<i>of fair play for the rights of individuals...</i>

691
00:55:34,514 --> 00:55:38,177
...under the law is on trial here,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

692
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:43,789
To this end, you must be guided
not only by your common sense...

693
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,481
...but by your patriotism.

694
00:55:56,236 --> 00:55:59,171
As counsel for these defendants,
Your Honor...

695
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:02,000
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

696
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:06,578
...I must point out that my clients
are not on trial for treason...

697
00:56:06,746 --> 00:56:09,180
...against any philosophy
of government...

698
00:56:09,382 --> 00:56:12,476
...as our esteemed district attorney
seems to think.

699
00:56:12,685 --> 00:56:14,516
They're on trial for murder.

700
00:56:14,687 --> 00:56:17,918
A charge you will see vanish
into thin air here...

701
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:21,492
...as the state, to cover up its own
criminal negligence...

702
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:25,960
...in not protecting this innocent man,
proceeds in this savage attempt...

703
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,657
...to kill as scapegoats...

704
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:32,202
...these 22 bewildered souls.

705
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:39,772
These defendants have pleaded
not guilty to the charge of murder.

706
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:42,905
We're ready, Your Honor.

707
00:56:45,118 --> 00:56:47,951
Are you ready, Mr. Adams?

708
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:52,988
With the permission of the court
and of my friends for the defense...

709
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:58,722
...and their experienced associate
brought from the city of New York...

710
00:56:58,932 --> 00:57:01,526
...l'll reverse the usual order
of procedure...

711
00:57:01,701 --> 00:57:04,363
...and instead of establishing
the crime itself...

712
00:57:04,537 --> 00:57:07,506
...first establish the whereabouts
of the accused...

713
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,539
...during the commission thereof.

714
00:57:09,709 --> 00:57:13,873
As its first witness,
the state calls Edna Hooper.

715
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:19,042
Raise your right hand
and place your left on the Bible.

716
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:22,882
Do you swear you'll tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

717
00:57:23,056 --> 00:57:25,752
- I do.
- Be seated, please.

718
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:30,220
- Your name?
- Miss Edna Hooper.

719
00:57:30,396 --> 00:57:34,833
- Your residence, Miss Hooper?
- Twenty-three Catalpa Avenue, Strand.

720
00:57:35,001 --> 00:57:37,936
Strand is the town in which
this lynching took place?

721
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:40,368
Objection! Object as
to his incompetence.

722
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:44,408
- Question assumes a fact not in evidence.
- Sustained. Strike it out.

723
00:57:44,577 --> 00:57:46,772
I will reframe the question.

724
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,441
Strand is where the jail burned down
on the night of October 26th, is it not?

725
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:55,281
Yes, but I certainly had nothing
to do with the...

726
00:57:55,488 --> 00:57:59,754
You're not on trial, Miss Hooper.
Your occupation in Strand, please?

727
00:57:59,926 --> 00:58:02,861
I am a couturier and a modiste.

728
00:58:03,029 --> 00:58:07,523
By couturier and modiste, you mean
you're a dressmaker, do you not?

729
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,034
It's just the difference between a
dress shop and a gown shoppe.

730
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:16,441
On the afternoon and evening
of the day in question...

731
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:20,204
...you were employed in your capacity
as a couturier...

732
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,975
...in the home of Frederick Garrett
in Strand, were you not?

733
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:27,642
- I was.
- Who was in the house beside yourself?

734
00:58:27,887 --> 00:58:30,447
The baby and Mr. And Mrs. Garrett.

735
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:32,591
And this Mr. Garrett...

736
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:36,490
...is the same Frederick Garrett
who is one of these defendants here?

737
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:38,392
Yes.

738
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:41,966
Will Frederick Garrett stand, please?

739
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:49,632
This man, charged with murder,
is the Frederick Garrett who...

740
00:58:51,077 --> 00:58:54,171
...by the testimony of your eyesight,
Miss Hooper...

741
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:58,545
...was at home that Saturday afternoon
and evening, then?

742
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,484
Yes.

743
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:06,518
I will remind the witness
that she is under oath...

744
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:08,024
...and ask her again.

745
00:59:08,194 --> 00:59:13,689
Edna Hooper, will you swear that during
the hours when this indictment...

746
00:59:13,866 --> 00:59:16,926
...charges that this defendant,
Frederick Garrett...

747
00:59:17,103 --> 00:59:20,470
...among others,
murdered Joseph Wilson...

748
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,340
...will you swear that during those hours
Garrett was peaceably in his own house?

749
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:31,974
Yes.

750
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,483
That's all. Thank you.

751
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:37,184
You can go.

752
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:41,685
Oh, Miss Hooper, isn't it true
that for years...

753
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:45,854
...you've been a close friend of, and,
before she married, roomed with...

754
00:59:46,032 --> 00:59:48,227
...Mrs. Garrett?
- Don't answer that!

755
00:59:48,401 --> 00:59:52,701
But this is a witness for the state,
sir, not for the defense.

756
00:59:52,872 --> 00:59:57,332
- I'm sorry, I simply meant to object.
- I withdraw the question.

757
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:03,505
Miss Franchette...

758
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:07,050
...you are then the proprietor
as well as the hostess...

759
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,688
...of the Green Light Inn?

760
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:13,189
Well, it's my place,
if that's what you mean.

761
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:17,728
That's just what I mean.
The list, please.

762
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,834
Will the defendants
whose names I read stand?

763
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:27,906
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin.

764
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:32,774
Miss Franchette,
do you recognize these men?

765
01:00:32,945 --> 01:00:34,742
I most certainly do.

766
01:00:34,914 --> 01:00:39,214
Did you see them at any time
between 5 and 9 p. M...

767
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:44,618
...on October 26th in Strand?
And, if so, where?

768
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:47,954
Well, they were all at my place.
In the caf.

769
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:52,961
From 6 till, oh, 10, 11, anyhow.

770
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:58,433
And what makes the presence of these
particular men stick in your mind?

771
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:02,904
Because, for once, Mr. Dawson
paid the bill.

772
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:08,706
You mean, by Mr. Dawson,
the defendant Kirby Dawson.

773
01:01:08,881 --> 01:01:10,542
Oh, yes.

774
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:15,154
Two years in jail, not identified
with any church.

775
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:20,054
- Objection!
- Sorry. I was just thinking out loud.

776
01:01:20,226 --> 01:01:21,784
Yeah.

777
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:25,158
This defendant, Kirby Dawson,
according to these notes...

778
01:01:25,331 --> 01:01:28,300
...also known as Bubbles...

779
01:01:28,468 --> 01:01:31,437
...for once paid the bill.

780
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:36,005
But he or someone else didn't pay you to
concoct an alibi for him and his friends...

781
01:01:36,209 --> 01:01:38,473
...by any chance, did they?
- Objection!

782
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:41,407
Sustained. Strike it out.

783
01:01:41,848 --> 01:01:46,114
I wonder if I haven't been calling
the defense witnesses by mistake.

784
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,810
His last remark proves
the district attorney...

785
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:51,650
...hasn't lost his humor,
in spite of the fact...

786
01:01:51,824 --> 01:01:55,419
...that his attempt to establish
the presence of the defendants...

787
01:01:55,595 --> 01:01:59,429
...at the lynching has either failed
or been ridiculed by the defense.

788
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,191
Wait. Just wait.

789
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:05,269
<i>Thaddus Hummel, Sheriff of Strand</i>
<i>County, is now on the stand.</i>

790
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:08,769
Can you identify any or all
of these defendants...

791
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:12,604
...as having been in the mob
that stormed your jail and burned it...

792
01:02:12,779 --> 01:02:15,304
...thereby burning your prisoner
to death?

793
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,039
Objection!

794
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:21,482
To the latter part of the question as
assuming a fact not yet proved.

795
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:24,714
I will change the question to:

796
01:02:24,891 --> 01:02:28,327
"Who stormed your jail
and burned it," then.

797
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:37,369
No, sir.

798
01:02:37,537 --> 01:02:39,334
I can't identify them.

799
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:44,867
Can you, then, tell me the names of
anyone, other then these defendants...

800
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:48,377
...among those rioters?
- No, sir.

801
01:02:48,548 --> 01:02:51,915
They must have been men
from out of town.

802
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:55,713
Oh, I see. Foreigners.

803
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:01,023
I will remind the jury of the easy habit
of putting on foreigners...

804
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,391
...events that disturb our conscience.

805
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:09,592
Or perhaps it was a roving band
of redskins. Indians, I mean.

806
01:03:09,802 --> 01:03:12,270
Only red-skinned thing I saw
was that tomato...

807
01:03:12,438 --> 01:03:15,305
...that plopped me in the face
and made a fool of me.

808
01:03:17,443 --> 01:03:21,675
I must remind the spectators
of the dignity of this court.

809
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:27,812
An injury you suffered put you to bed
for a week, sheriff.

810
01:03:27,987 --> 01:03:29,852
How did that happen?

811
01:03:30,022 --> 01:03:32,786
The deputies that stuck with me...

812
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:35,023
...most of them disappeared...

813
01:03:35,194 --> 01:03:37,856
...and I were holding off the mob
as best we could...

814
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:40,021
...with tear gas and rifle butts...

815
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,827
...when somebody slugged me
from behind, and l...

816
01:03:43,002 --> 01:03:47,996
You said, "slugged," "tear gas,"
"rifle butts," "mob."

817
01:03:48,174 --> 01:03:50,699
After all, this was an attempted
lynching then!

818
01:03:50,877 --> 01:03:53,243
- Objection!
- The question was proper!

819
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:56,643
I disagree! Your constant use
of the word lynching...

820
01:03:56,816 --> 01:03:59,148
If counsel's ears were as quick
as his objections...

821
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:01,377
...he'd know I said
attempted lynching.

822
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:04,988
If the state's evidence was
as breathtaking as its sarcasm...

823
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:08,820
...which I suggest is being employed
to hide from the jury...

824
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:12,487
...the failure of its own witnesses
to back up its hollow case...

825
01:04:12,665 --> 01:04:15,566
Hooray! Hollow as a busted jug,
is what it is!

826
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:17,396
Quiet, will you?

827
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:19,328
Remove that man.

828
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:22,700
- I was just...
- Come here. You're going.

829
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:28,042
They hadn't ought to treat Uncle Billy
that way! Uncle Billy's right!

830
01:04:28,214 --> 01:04:31,274
This is a shame against the good name
of our town.

831
01:04:32,418 --> 01:04:36,445
- Bring that man before the court.
- Order in the court. Quiet.

832
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:39,056
He won't do nothing to me.
I ain't afraid.

833
01:04:39,225 --> 01:04:40,749
Sit down, you. Sit down!

834
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:44,891
I order you held in contempt
with a fine of $ 100...

835
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:46,929
...or 10 days in the county jail.

836
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:49,226
I protest against this injustice!

837
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:52,394
The fine will be $200 or 30 days.

838
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,774
But he can't put me in...
Why, all I said was...

839
01:04:58,945 --> 01:05:01,209
A trial for murder...

840
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:04,713
...is the most solemn occasion
upon which men can be called...

841
01:05:04,884 --> 01:05:07,148
...to perform a public duty.

842
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:12,189
Any further demonstration
and I shall order the courtroom cleared.

843
01:05:13,426 --> 01:05:15,257
- Proceed.
- May it please the court.

844
01:05:16,596 --> 01:05:18,393
The state's own witnesses...

845
01:05:18,564 --> 01:05:22,125
...have not been able to identify
these defendants...

846
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,168
...as having even been
at the scene of the crime...

847
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,169
...alleged in the indictment.

848
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,776
We must insist that the state
give us facts...

849
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:32,843
...instead of...

850
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,071
...tittle-tattle here.

851
01:05:35,247 --> 01:05:36,942
Your Honor...

852
01:05:37,116 --> 01:05:39,914
...in the last 49 years...

853
01:05:40,086 --> 01:05:45,752
...mobs have lynched
6010 human beings...

854
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:51,488
...by hanging, burning, cutting,
in this proud land of ours.

855
01:05:51,664 --> 01:05:55,725
A lynching about every three days.

856
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:59,760
And of the many thousands
that comprise these mobs...

857
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:05,002
...only 765 were ever
even brought to trial...

858
01:06:05,177 --> 01:06:08,669
...because their supposedly
civilized communities...

859
01:06:08,848 --> 01:06:11,783
...have refused to identify them
for trial.

860
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:16,354
Thus becoming as responsible,
before God at any rate...

861
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:19,320
...as the lynchers themselves.

862
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:24,357
I did not put these representative
citizens of Strand on the stand...

863
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:28,796
...to prove anything, Your Honor,
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

864
01:06:28,968 --> 01:06:32,699
...except that on their oaths...

865
01:06:32,872 --> 01:06:38,674
...to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth, so help them God...

866
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:42,180
...they are liars!

867
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:48,519
And that their contempt of truth
shall not go unpunished...

868
01:06:48,688 --> 01:06:51,521
...I shall ask
their indictment for perjury...

869
01:06:51,691 --> 01:06:55,092
...on the same evidence that
in one minute...

870
01:06:55,294 --> 01:06:58,525
...will prove the identity
of these defendants...

871
01:06:58,731 --> 01:07:02,098
<i>... with that of 22 active members</i>
<i>of the mob...</i>

872
01:07:02,301 --> 01:07:07,102
<i>... that stormed and burned the jail</i>
<i>and lynched Joseph Wilson!</i>

873
01:07:07,306 --> 01:07:09,604
<i>I shall introduce that evidence now.</i>

874
01:07:09,842 --> 01:07:13,073
Will counsel for the defense
please approach the bench?

875
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:19,949
While the judge is hearing arguments
over the admission of evidence...

876
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:24,453
...l'll take this opportunity to remind you
this broadcast is brought to you...

877
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,855
...courtesy of No Make-A Me Fat,
that magic dessert...

878
01:07:29,028 --> 01:07:31,519
Flash! Against the objection
of the defense...

879
01:07:31,697 --> 01:07:35,098
...the judge has just admitted
this evidence, whatever it is!

880
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:42,702
Stand back, everybody.
Clear the door.

881
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,409
I warn the spectators
against any demonstrations.

882
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:54,575
At the slightest sign of disorder,
I will unhesitatingly clear this court.

883
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:57,780
- We are ready, Your Honor.
- Proceed.

884
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:03,394
By stipulation with defense attorneys
that this is a true film record...

885
01:08:03,562 --> 01:08:09,125
...taken at Strand by Ted Fitzgerald,
in employment as a news cameraman...

886
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:14,295
...I hereby present this film
as state's Exhibit A.

887
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:16,407
Close the shutters.

888
01:08:16,575 --> 01:08:18,167
- Ready?
- Ready.

889
01:08:18,377 --> 01:08:20,004
- Ready?
- Let it run.

890
01:08:23,282 --> 01:08:27,742
Defendant number one,
Kirby Dawson...

891
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,321
...who, according to testimony,
was in the Green Light Inn...

892
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,584
...during the hours of the commission
of this crime.

893
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:40,158
A stop action of the scene.

894
01:08:40,332 --> 01:08:43,267
Defendant number two,
Mrs. Sally Humphries...

895
01:08:43,435 --> 01:08:45,403
...who, according to testimony...

896
01:08:45,704 --> 01:08:50,004
...during the hours of this crime
was on the farm of her fianc.

897
01:08:50,176 --> 01:08:53,805
We identify her by stop action
of the same shot.

898
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:59,149
The first brand that transformed
that jail into a blazing stake...

899
01:08:59,318 --> 01:09:01,218
...for Joseph Wilson.

900
01:09:02,188 --> 01:09:05,851
The fire department courageously tried
to extinguish those flames...

901
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:08,687
...but overwhelming numbers
fought them back.

902
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:12,558
While in the meantime,
the defendant Frederick Garrett...

903
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,962
...peaceably armed with an ax,
destroyed the efforts of the officials...

904
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:20,799
...to save the life of an innocent man.
The enlarged stop action...

905
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:26,577
No, no! It's not true. He...

906
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:32,377
Order in the court! Order!
Order in the court!

907
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:53,094
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Couldn't get a car. There's a crowd.

908
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:55,740
That's all. That's all.

909
01:09:57,209 --> 01:09:59,871
- Do you feel better today?
- Don't worry.

910
01:10:00,379 --> 01:10:03,871
- Second floor. Traffic Court.
- Pardon me.

911
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:14,190
- Got a cigarette, Tom?
- Sure.

912
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,559
Peanuts.

913
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:23,428
Judge Hopkins' Court.

914
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:25,536
Come on. We're getting out too.

915
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,373
The last the sheriff, the jailer, or anyone
else saw of him was before the fire.

916
01:10:31,543 --> 01:10:34,011
I must insist on my question.

917
01:10:34,213 --> 01:10:38,741
Who proved that Joseph Wilson was in
that jail at the time it burned?

918
01:10:38,918 --> 01:10:41,887
- The jailer threw the keys down.
- Are you ready?

919
01:10:42,054 --> 01:10:47,458
Isn't there the possibility the prisoner
angled for those keys and escaped?

920
01:10:47,626 --> 01:10:50,254
- Are you ready?
- We say that possibility exists.

921
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:53,727
It's up to the state to prove it false.

922
01:10:53,966 --> 01:10:56,730
Is the state prepared to proceed?

923
01:10:56,902 --> 01:11:00,531
We call Katherine Grant to the stand.

924
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:04,634
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

925
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,074
- <i>I do.</i>
- <i>Be seated, please.</i>

926
01:11:07,246 --> 01:11:11,182
<i>State your name, residence</i>
<i>and occupation, please.</i>

927
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,681
<i>Katherine Grant.</i>

928
01:11:12,918 --> 01:11:15,682
I'm a teacher in the
Washington Public School here.

929
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,788
I live at 96 Oak Street.

930
01:11:17,957 --> 01:11:20,755
With your parents, Miss Grant?

931
01:11:20,926 --> 01:11:22,826
My father and mother are dead.

932
01:11:22,995 --> 01:11:27,864
Your relationship to Joseph Wilson was?

933
01:11:29,468 --> 01:11:31,663
We were going to be married.

934
01:11:31,837 --> 01:11:35,329
Will you tell the jury, in your own way...

935
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:39,273
...what happened on October 26th.

936
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:44,039
I fixed a little lunch of things
I thought he'd like.

937
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:46,844
With flowers on the table...

938
01:11:47,019 --> 01:11:49,487
...and some salted...

939
01:11:50,856 --> 01:11:54,383
...peanuts. He always liked peanuts.

940
01:11:54,593 --> 01:11:57,153
Are you able to go on, Miss Grant?

941
01:11:57,863 --> 01:12:00,593
Certainly I can go on.

942
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:03,529
I went to meet him at Sycamore Corners.

943
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:07,661
On the way, I bought him
some neckties for a present.

944
01:12:09,141 --> 01:12:11,371
He liked blue.

945
01:12:13,045 --> 01:12:17,505
He never thought of buying
things like that for himself.

946
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:22,381
And then I stopped at
the minister's to remind him...

947
01:12:22,554 --> 01:12:26,650
<i>... that Joe and I would be there</i>
<i>at 4:00, and not to forget.</i>

948
01:12:28,227 --> 01:12:30,855
<i>We'd been away from</i>
<i>each other so long.</i>

949
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:33,260
<i>More than a year.</i>

950
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:37,891
<i>And l</i>... <i>I loved him so.</i>

951
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:11,803
<i>I turn the witness over to the defense.</i>

952
01:13:12,171 --> 01:13:15,231
<i>Miss Grant. According to</i>
<i>the fact of psychology...</i>

953
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:19,741
...that under great emotional stress
the mind sees what it has expected to...

954
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:22,472
...whether the thing
is actually there or not...

955
01:13:22,681 --> 01:13:26,742
...is it not possible that you
did not see Joseph Wilson...

956
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:30,821
...but only the image of him your
imagination had created in your head?

957
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:34,584
No, I saw him. I saw him
burning to death there!

958
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,389
You can see that picture now
too, can't you?

959
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:40,998
- I'll always see it.
- So perhaps after all...

960
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:45,500
...it was an hallucination of your tortured
mind that you saw there...

961
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:47,899
...just as you see it here.

962
01:13:48,073 --> 01:13:51,770
What do you want me to say,
yes or no? I tell you I saw him.

963
01:13:51,944 --> 01:13:56,438
Can you, from your
own personal knowledge...

964
01:13:56,615 --> 01:13:59,413
...swear that Joseph Wilson is dead?

965
01:13:59,585 --> 01:14:02,145
Why, no. That is, yes.

966
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:04,949
- I mean, one can assume.
- Excuse me...

967
01:14:05,124 --> 01:14:09,151
...but that is exactly what must not
be assumed, but proved!

968
01:14:09,328 --> 01:14:13,162
The state is asking the lives
of 22 people for one.

969
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:15,664
I don't care about the lives of 22 people!

970
01:14:15,834 --> 01:14:18,268
They can't bring back
the life I cared about.

971
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:23,670
I only wish I hadn't fainted. I wish I could
have gone in there to him. With him.

972
01:14:24,143 --> 01:14:26,373
That's all, Miss Grant.

973
01:14:33,685 --> 01:14:36,950
I will remind the jury
that under the law...

974
01:14:37,122 --> 01:14:41,491
...lives must not be taken on
assumptions but on facts!

975
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:44,220
Where is the corpse of Joseph Wilson?

976
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:47,729
<i>The law is that the corpus</i>
<i>delicti must be established...</i>

977
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,027
<i>... at least by fragments</i>
<i>of the human body...</i>

978
01:14:50,202 --> 01:14:54,639
<i>... or of articles known and proved</i>
<i>to have been worn by the deceased.</i>

979
01:14:54,973 --> 01:14:58,636
And in the absence of convincing proof
of the corpus delicti...

980
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:01,643
...I move this indictment
be wiped off the records...

981
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:05,339
...and the charges against
these defendants be dismissed.

982
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:09,544
I shall take the motion for dismissal
under advisement until tomorrow...

983
01:15:10,055 --> 01:15:12,717
<i>... and hear the state's arguments then.</i>

984
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:29,769
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

985
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:31,876
...I have received an object...

986
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:33,909
...which, if authentic...

987
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:36,946
...must be considered
as evidence in this case.

988
01:15:37,316 --> 01:15:42,219
As to its authenticity, I am not
permitted to have an opinion.

989
01:15:42,387 --> 01:15:46,448
However, in order to present it to you...

990
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,389
...I must take the witness stand.

991
01:15:50,562 --> 01:15:52,120
Mr. Clerk...

992
01:15:52,331 --> 01:15:54,060
...please swear me.

993
01:15:59,104 --> 01:16:02,767
Do you swear that you'll tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

994
01:16:02,941 --> 01:16:05,136
- I do.
- Please be seated.

995
01:16:07,546 --> 01:16:10,310
This is a special delivery
letter postmarked...

996
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,747
...in this city at 11 p.m. Last night...

997
01:16:13,919 --> 01:16:19,050
...and addressed "Judge Daniel Hopkins,
Hall of Justice, Courtroom 10."

998
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:22,621
Is this the letter you received,
Your Honor?

999
01:16:27,966 --> 01:16:29,593
It is.

1000
01:16:31,136 --> 01:16:33,730
The communication is not handwritten.

1001
01:16:33,905 --> 01:16:37,068
It is formed by letters cut
from a newspaper...

1002
01:16:37,242 --> 01:16:39,972
...and pasted together to spell words.

1003
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:43,945
It is, ladies and gentlemen, the
confession of a tortured conscience.

1004
01:16:44,116 --> 01:16:45,447
Listen.

1005
01:16:45,617 --> 01:16:47,778
"I can't hide the truth any longer.

1006
01:16:47,953 --> 01:16:52,014
I am a citizen of Strand
who helped clean up the jail mess.

1007
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:55,785
In the ashes,
I found this enclosed ring.

1008
01:16:55,961 --> 01:17:01,297
Nobody knew it, so I was keeping it for
a mement... Memento.

1009
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:03,696
But it is upsetting my conscience.

1010
01:17:03,902 --> 01:17:08,134
I don't dare sign this, or I would
probably get lynched myself.

1011
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:11,037
A citizen of Strand."

1012
01:17:15,180 --> 01:17:17,444
I now draw your attention to this ring.

1013
01:17:17,616 --> 01:17:21,780
It's gold, melted and misshapen,
as if by fire.

1014
01:17:21,987 --> 01:17:26,651
Inside the ring is an engraved
inscription, reading...

1015
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:29,053
I can decipher only the words...

1016
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:32,219
..."Henry to K."

1017
01:17:32,431 --> 01:17:34,023
The rest is melted out.

1018
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,931
But after that word, I can plainly read...

1019
01:17:38,136 --> 01:17:40,468
...in a different style of engraving...

1020
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:43,005
..."To Joe," obviously meaning...

1021
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:45,234
- Objection!
- Sustained.

1022
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:48,709
Since when have anonymous letters
become gospel in law?

1023
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:52,179
Who can say that ring was
the property of Joseph Wilson?

1024
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:54,546
What proof is there that it was found...

1025
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,985
...as that concocted letter
would have us believe?

1026
01:17:58,156 --> 01:18:01,523
Who sent that letter?
A man afraid to sign his name.

1027
01:18:02,027 --> 01:18:05,258
I believe that this fraud is
a fabrication of some soul...

1028
01:18:06,965 --> 01:18:09,957
...poisoned with hostility
toward these defendants!

1029
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:14,204
The state recalls
Katherine Grant to the stand.

1030
01:18:24,716 --> 01:18:29,244
I will remind you, Miss Grant,
you've already sworn to tell the truth.

1031
01:18:30,589 --> 01:18:33,752
Have you ever seen this ring before?

1032
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:39,025
- Yes.
- Where and when?

1033
01:18:39,698 --> 01:18:42,394
In the railroad station in Chicago.

1034
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:44,762
When I was leaving to come here.

1035
01:18:44,936 --> 01:18:46,699
I gave it to Joe.

1036
01:18:46,872 --> 01:18:50,399
What did Joseph Wilson do with it
when you gave it to him?

1037
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,810
He put it on his little finger.

1038
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:56,708
It was too small for any other finger.

1039
01:18:56,882 --> 01:19:00,079
How can you be sure this ring
is the one you gave him...

1040
01:19:00,252 --> 01:19:03,449
...and saw him put
on his little finger there?

1041
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:08,322
Because it was my mother's.

1042
01:19:08,927 --> 01:19:13,796
It had engraved "Henry,"
my father's name...

1043
01:19:14,466 --> 01:19:18,232
..."to Katherine," which was
my mother's name too.

1044
01:19:19,938 --> 01:19:22,429
After the "Katherine"...

1045
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:25,309
...I had it engraved...

1046
01:19:26,077 --> 01:19:28,170
..."to Joe."

1047
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:32,078
I want to confess!

1048
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,740
Let me go!

1049
01:19:33,919 --> 01:19:35,477
I threw stones at him!

1050
01:19:35,687 --> 01:19:37,018
I helped kill him!

1051
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,283
I'm guilty! We're all guilty!

1052
01:19:40,459 --> 01:19:44,862
Let me ask her to forgive me!
Please, please, forgive me!

1053
01:19:45,096 --> 01:19:46,620
Forgive me!

1054
01:19:46,798 --> 01:19:48,857
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1055
01:19:49,067 --> 01:19:50,762
Forgive me!

1056
01:19:50,936 --> 01:19:53,769
...there is your answer to this case!

1057
01:19:55,807 --> 01:19:58,799
That letter cinched it for us, didn't it?

1058
01:19:59,778 --> 01:20:01,803
Yeah, why?

1059
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,174
It was certainly lucky for us
that it showed up...

1060
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:08,114
...wasn't it?
- Stop talking about it.

1061
01:20:08,286 --> 01:20:09,844
I mean...

1062
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:12,387
...where does it get you?

1063
01:20:15,627 --> 01:20:18,494
- Why didn't you tell me Joe was alive?
- What?

1064
01:20:18,663 --> 01:20:21,496
- Are you crazy?
- I know he's alive, Charlie. I know.

1065
01:20:21,666 --> 01:20:23,691
Will you shut your mouth?

1066
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:26,864
You can't keep me quiet.
What's happened to him?

1067
01:20:27,038 --> 01:20:30,303
Does he realize what he's done?
What we've all done?

1068
01:20:30,475 --> 01:20:32,340
- Where is he?
- You saw him.

1069
01:20:32,511 --> 01:20:34,502
You saw him in that fire.
Why ask me?

1070
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:37,648
You testified, not me. I wasn't there.

1071
01:20:37,816 --> 01:20:40,512
You're losing your mind again.

1072
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,311
Of course.

1073
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:46,884
Of course you're right.

1074
01:20:49,494 --> 01:20:52,019
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1075
01:20:52,697 --> 01:20:54,528
Of course you're right.

1076
01:20:54,699 --> 01:20:56,360
He's dead.

1077
01:20:57,669 --> 01:21:00,832
But I haven't slept for so long.

1078
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:03,664
I want to go.

1079
01:21:03,842 --> 01:21:06,402
I can't listen to any more.
I want to go home.

1080
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:11,213
It was that letter that made her jump.
I don't know...

1081
01:21:11,383 --> 01:21:13,613
You're trying to make yourself important.

1082
01:21:13,785 --> 01:21:16,948
- Katherine suspicious? You're daffy!
- I'm daffy!

1083
01:21:17,155 --> 01:21:20,090
Take a look at your radio.
I tell you, that letter...

1084
01:21:20,258 --> 01:21:23,091
That letter was the best idea I ever had.

1085
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:26,697
Yeah. Almost cost me my finger
getting that ring off.

1086
01:21:26,865 --> 01:21:31,165
But it was worth it. It would have been
worth the whole hand. Two hands.

1087
01:21:31,736 --> 01:21:34,933
Tom, why don't you stick with me?
You know as well...

1088
01:21:35,106 --> 01:21:38,473
Yeah, you're right.
What's the use of fighting with him?

1089
01:21:38,677 --> 01:21:42,579
Anyway, she's home now.
We got the landlady to put her to bed.

1090
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:46,373
Must have been some sensation
when that woman collapsed.

1091
01:21:46,585 --> 01:21:48,917
They could stand seeing
me burned to death.

1092
01:21:49,087 --> 01:21:51,681
- They can't stand an honest trial.
- Cut it out!

1093
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:54,450
I can't stand it!
I can't hear any more!

1094
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:58,585
You haven't been watching them.
You didn't look in their eyes.

1095
01:21:58,763 --> 01:22:02,927
- Yellow-livered welsher, sorry for them.
- You're as bad! You're lynching me!

1096
01:22:03,101 --> 01:22:07,561
It's getting me too. I wish I hadn't
started the whole thing. I was with you.

1097
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:10,401
But I got a feeling you talked
me into something.

1098
01:22:10,575 --> 01:22:12,406
If I could think of a way out...

1099
01:22:12,577 --> 01:22:14,135
Why don't you snitch on me!

1100
01:22:14,312 --> 01:22:18,442
- Nobody's talking about that!
- I am! I can't stand it any longer!

1101
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,649
Be human, Joe.

1102
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:23,083
We can get out of the country,
start over.

1103
01:22:23,254 --> 01:22:27,657
But let's tell them the truth.
Let's tell them you're alive!

1104
01:22:29,227 --> 01:22:31,593
I'll kill you first.

1105
01:22:34,132 --> 01:22:37,033
You might as well kill me too.

1106
01:22:42,107 --> 01:22:44,007
You brought her here, you lying...

1107
01:22:44,175 --> 01:22:45,642
No, Joe. I followed them!

1108
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:50,645
I knew you were alive when I saw your
letter. Why not kill me! Do a good job!

1109
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:54,717
What difference does it make?
Twenty-two, 23, 25!

1110
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,354
- Listen to me, Joe.
- No!

1111
01:22:59,824 --> 01:23:01,553
I'm sorry.

1112
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,228
I didn't mean to talk that way.

1113
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:07,888
Joe, I understand how you feel...

1114
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,534
...and I understand
why you feel that way.

1115
01:23:10,702 --> 01:23:12,670
When I thought you were dead...

1116
01:23:12,837 --> 01:23:16,068
...when I thought of what killed you,
I wanted revenge too.

1117
01:23:16,274 --> 01:23:17,832
But now I don't.

1118
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:22,378
I want to be happy again. I want what
we've always promised each other.

1119
01:23:22,547 --> 01:23:25,516
You ought to have violins
playing when you talk.

1120
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:29,518
- I know what I want, and I'm getting it!
- You're hanging 22 people!

1121
01:23:29,688 --> 01:23:32,987
No, I'm not. I'm hanging 22 rats
for something they did do.

1122
01:23:33,158 --> 01:23:34,989
- These are 22 human beings.
- Yeah.

1123
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,323
- They live and breathe.
- Like me in the jail, for instance!

1124
01:23:38,496 --> 01:23:41,556
They're not murderers.
They were part of a mob.

1125
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:46,067
- A mob doesn't think. It hasn't time.
- What about the guy in jail? He can think.

1126
01:23:46,237 --> 01:23:50,037
All right, it's his turn. Let them know
what it means to be lynched.

1127
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:52,369
- Don't you think they know by now?
- No.

1128
01:23:52,544 --> 01:23:57,413
What you've felt for a few hours,
they've had to face for days and weeks!

1129
01:23:57,582 --> 01:24:02,246
Wishing, with all their souls, they could
have that one day to live over again.

1130
01:24:04,055 --> 01:24:05,579
Joe...

1131
01:24:06,524 --> 01:24:08,458
...don't you see?

1132
01:24:08,927 --> 01:24:11,896
We can be together and be happy.

1133
01:24:13,364 --> 01:24:16,060
Let me go with you to the judge.

1134
01:24:16,601 --> 01:24:19,434
And then we can start all over again.

1135
01:24:19,604 --> 01:24:22,129
Stop thinking about them.
Think about me.

1136
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:24,535
I am thinking about you.

1137
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:26,802
About what a swell guy you were...

1138
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:30,038
...when you were alive.
- When I was alive?

1139
01:24:30,215 --> 01:24:33,048
If those people die, Joe Wilson dies.
You know that.

1140
01:24:33,218 --> 01:24:36,051
Wherever you go. Whatever you do.

1141
01:24:37,255 --> 01:24:39,587
I couldn't marry you now, Joe.

1142
01:24:39,891 --> 01:24:42,121
I couldn't marry a dead man.

1143
01:24:42,293 --> 01:24:45,490
All right, then, all right!
I don't need anybody!

1144
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:47,130
Nobody!

1145
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:51,164
Maybe this is crazy.

1146
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:55,940
I can't help thinking we'd be
better off if you hadn't escaped.

1147
01:24:56,107 --> 01:24:58,598
That's what you can't help thinking?
Who cares?

1148
01:24:58,777 --> 01:25:01,268
This is a big night.
I ought to be celebrating.

1149
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:04,438
And that's what I'm gonna do too!
Celebrate. Alone!

1150
01:25:04,616 --> 01:25:08,950
From now on, I'm gonna do everything
alone! I don't need any of you!

1151
01:25:22,133 --> 01:25:23,896
Hey.

1152
01:25:24,903 --> 01:25:26,268
- Yes?
- This stuff's weak.

1153
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:28,132
- Get me bourbon.
- Sorry, sir...

1154
01:25:28,306 --> 01:25:31,969
...but with the kind of license
we have here, it's against the law.

1155
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:33,800
All right. Give me a check.

1156
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:38,210
- I'm sorry, sir, if you feel...
- No. It's all right. It's just, it's too noisy.

1157
01:25:38,416 --> 01:25:40,611
I don't like crowded places.

1158
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:06,675
<i>Are you planning to do a lot of running</i>
<i>around in this room?</i>

1159
01:26:13,284 --> 01:26:14,911
Have a good time...

1160
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,616
...and bye-bye.

1161
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,705
Come in, mister.

1162
01:26:43,648 --> 01:26:45,809
- What's your pleasure?
- Double bourbon.

1163
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:47,781
Yes, sir.

1164
01:26:57,829 --> 01:27:01,026
Midnight, and another day.

1165
01:27:06,204 --> 01:27:09,002
Two pages must've got hanged together.

1166
01:27:45,476 --> 01:27:48,445
<i>Do a good job of it!</i>
<i>What does it matter?</i>

1167
01:27:48,613 --> 01:27:52,014
<i>Twenty-two, 23, 25!</i>

1168
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:46,529
Katherine! Katherine!

1169
01:29:05,223 --> 01:29:09,853
Katherine, don't leave me alone.

1170
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:24,139
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1171
01:29:24,308 --> 01:29:26,970
...have you agreed upon a verdict?

1172
01:29:27,178 --> 01:29:28,577
We have, Your Honor.

1173
01:29:28,746 --> 01:29:31,806
You will hand the verdict
to the bailiff.

1174
01:29:39,257 --> 01:29:43,159
We find in the case of the people of
the state versus the defendants...

1175
01:29:43,327 --> 01:29:47,423
...charged with the murder of Joseph
Wilson as set forth in the indictment.

1176
01:29:47,598 --> 01:29:49,725
Jasper Anderson, not guilty.

1177
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:53,599
Gilbert Clark, not guilty.

1178
01:29:53,771 --> 01:29:57,639
Richard Durkin, guilty.

1179
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:00,437
Walter Dubbs, guilty.

1180
01:30:00,611 --> 01:30:02,977
Kirby Dawson, guilty.

1181
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,479
Frederick Garrett, guilty.

1182
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:08,949
- Walter Gordon, guilty.
- No, no! I'm not. Not me!

1183
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,418
Go ahead, go ahead, get it over with!

1184
01:30:30,041 --> 01:30:32,475
Order in the court!

1185
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:40,181
Your Honor, I am Joseph Wilson.

1186
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:42,615
Keep your seats!

1187
01:30:43,888 --> 01:30:46,118
- Go on.
- I know that by coming here...

1188
01:30:46,290 --> 01:30:49,316
...I saved the lives of these 22 people.

1189
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:53,657
But that isn't why I'm here. I don't care
anything about saving them.

1190
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,995
They're murderers. I know the law
says they're not because I'm still alive.

1191
01:30:58,169 --> 01:30:59,830
But that's not their fault.

1192
01:31:00,138 --> 01:31:04,472
And the law doesn't know that a lot of
things that were very important to me...

1193
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:08,134
...silly things, maybe,
like a belief in justice...

1194
01:31:08,312 --> 01:31:11,406
...and an idea that men were civilized...

1195
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:16,918
...and a feeling of pride that this country
of mine was different from all others.

1196
01:31:17,088 --> 01:31:21,286
The law doesn't know those things were
burned to death within me that night.

1197
01:31:21,859 --> 01:31:24,020
I came here today for my own sake.

1198
01:31:24,228 --> 01:31:26,093
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1199
01:31:26,297 --> 01:31:30,495
I couldn't stop thinking about them,
with every step and every breath I took.

1200
01:31:30,668 --> 01:31:33,899
And I didn't believe Katherine
when she said...

1201
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:39,841
Katherine is the young lady
who was going to marry me.

1202
01:31:40,011 --> 01:31:43,344
Maybe someday after
I've paid for what I did...

1203
01:31:43,514 --> 01:31:46,381
...there'll be a chance to begin again.

1204
01:31:46,717 --> 01:31:49,049
And then maybe...

1205
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:52,048
...Katherine and I...
- Joe.

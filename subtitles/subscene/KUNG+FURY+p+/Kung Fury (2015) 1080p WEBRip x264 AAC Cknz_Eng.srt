1
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,640
Hey, you got a permit
for those guns?

2
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,610
I got your permit right here.

3
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,160
Catchy tune.

4
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,160
Fuck this game.

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,040
FUCK YOU!

6
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,380
We need backup,
we need Kung Fury!

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,260
Yeah, that's my bicep.

8
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,900
One second babe.

9
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,860
Hello?

10
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,940
<i>We got an arcade machine
down here going crazy,</i>

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,140
<i>it is killing everybody,
it's destruction, chaos, terror-</i>

12
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
What are you gonna do?

13
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,240
My job.

14
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,580
Game over.

15
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,280
<i>I'm a cop and
damn good at my job.</i>

16
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,000
<i>It all began years ago.</i>

17
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,590
<i>In the line of duty,</i>

18
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,160
<i>me and my partner were
chasing down</i>

19
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,160
<i>a mysterious Kung Fu-master.</i>

20
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,000
You're under arrest, punk.

21
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,160
Show us your hands.

22
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,580
Good work, Dragon.

23
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
You could've killed both of us
with that crazy stunt

24
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,680
but goddammit, you're the
best partner I've ever had.

25
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,960
Thanks,
I learned from the best.

26
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,660
You're like a father to me.

27
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,910
<i>With one fatal blow,
he hit my partner.</i>

28
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,120
<i>I could tell
he was dead straight off.</i>

29
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,140
<i>Before I could pull the trigger...</i>

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,420
<i>I was hit by lightning
and bitten by a cobra.</i>

31
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:58,080
<i>I blacked out.</i>

32
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,870
<i>And saw images of ancient
Shaolin temples and monks,</i>

33
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,840
<i>mastering the art of Kung Fu.</i>

34
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,710
<i>There was an ancient prophecy,</i>

35
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>about a new form
of Kung Fu so powerful,</i>

36
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,120
<i>only one man could master it.</i>

37
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
<i>The chosen one.</i>

38
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>When I woke up,</i>

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>I saw the Kung Fu master
running towards me.</i>

40
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,820
<i>I could feel my body mutate</i>

41
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,760
<i>into some sort of
Kung Fu freak of nature.</i>

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,740
You!

43
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,710
You are the chosen one!

44
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,780
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,420
Knuckles.

46
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,180
<i>As a memento,</i>

47
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,500
<i>I put on a strip of cloth
from the dead Kung Fu master.</i>

48
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,480
<i>I decided I would use
my new super Kung Fu powers</i>

49
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,580
to fight crime.

50
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,740
<i>So, I became
the best cop in the world.</i>

51
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,040
<i>I became, Kung Fury.</i>

52
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,840
<i>I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.</i>

53
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,540
<i>I just got back from city hall,
$50 million worth of damages,</i>

54
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,940
<i>and I got the mayor up
my ass like a fag on Viagra.</i>

55
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,840
How am I going to explain
this to the press, hmm?

56
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,240
You just destroyed an entire
city block for Christ's sake.

57
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,160
Didn't you tell me
to block it out?

58
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,090
I told you do it by the book.

59
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,260
Cut the bullshit.

60
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,890
Nobody else could have stopped

61
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,960
that arcade machine
and you know it.

62
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,060
<i>Oh man, listen to me Kung Fury.</i>

63
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,670
You need to start following
the rules like the rest of us,

64
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,770
so I'm assigning you
a new partner.

65
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,800
What?
Hell no, I work alone.

66
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,470
Not anymore you don't.

67
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,020
Say hi to your new partner,
Triceracop.

68
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,250
Very nice meeting you Kung Fury,

69
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,480
looking forward to
working with you.

70
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
You're like a father to me.

71
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
I work alone.

72
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,420
Either you team up
with Triceracop,

73
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
or you're off the case.

74
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,540
I'm not off the case,

75
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,100
I quit.

76
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah Yeah, I did the blood test.

77
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,140
It was positive, yeah?

78
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,250
<i>What the hell
are you talking about?</i>

79
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,500
Yeah no problem.

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,280
<i>Give me the phone.</i>

81
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
What the hell is this?

82
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,060
- Chief McNickles speaking.
- Is this the police?

83
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,060
- <i>Yeah, this is the police.</i>
- Fuck you!

84
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,680
<i>MALFUNCTIONING?</i>

85
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,700
I need someone
to trace that call!

86
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,640
But that's impossible!

87
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,540
Not for me it isn't.

88
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,070
<i>Hackerman, he's the most
powerful hacker of all time.</i>

89
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,440
Follow me.

90
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,260
I was able to triangulate
the cell phone signal

91
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,420
and trace the caller.

92
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,520
His name is Adolf Hitler.

93
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,520
Hitler, he's the worst
criminal of all time.

94
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,720
Do you know him, sir?

95
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,320
I guess you could say that.

96
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,440
In the 1940's,
Hitler was a Kung Fu champion.

97
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:53,260
<i>He was so good at Kung Fu,</i>

98
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,920
that he decided to change
his name to Kung Fuhrer.

99
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,360
But he didn't stop there.

100
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,640
<i>He knew of
the Kung Fury prophecy,</i>

101
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,440
<i>and wanted to claim the throne.</i>

102
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,740
<i>So he and his posse of
Nazi soldiers</i>

103
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,740
<i>conducted experiments
for years.</i>

104
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,600
<i>But they weren't able
to figure out</i>

105
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,160
<i>how to master the art
of Kung Fury.</i>

106
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,900
<i>And one day,</i>

107
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:27,000
<i>he disappeared
from the face of the earth.</i>

108
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,740
<i>And no-one has seen him
ever since.</i>

109
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,300
Until now.

110
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
I guess he figured if he could
find the chosen one and kill him,

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,140
he would become
Kung Fury himself.

112
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,320
He must have traveled in time
in order to get here,

113
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,960
that's probably why he
disappeared in the first place.

114
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,820
So, what're you gonna do?

115
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,120
My job.

116
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm gonna go back in time
to Nazi Germany,

117
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,760
and kill Hitler,
once and for all.

118
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,000
<i>So, how are you gonna do that?</i>

119
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm not sure.

120
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,060
I need some sort of
time machine.

121
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,880
Wait a minute,

122
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,740
using an RX modulator,
I might be able to conduct

123
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,630
a mainframe cell direct and
hack the uplink to the download.

124
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,560
What does that mean?

125
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,270
It means that with the right computer
algorithms, I can hack you back in time.

126
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,200
Just like a time machine.

127
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,540
Well then, it's hacking time.

128
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,860
Oh, no!

129
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,960
<i>Fuck!</i>

130
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,340
<i>That's a Laser-Raptor.</i>

131
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,720
<i>I thought they went extinct
thousands of years ago.</i>

132
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,480
Who are you?

133
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
My name,

134
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,640
is Barbarianna.

135
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,240
What year is this?

136
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,000
It's the Viking age.

137
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,860
<i>That explains the Laser-Raptor.
Fuck!</i>

138
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,700
<i>I went too far back in time.</i>

139
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,920
You need to get out
of this valley.

140
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,640
This place is swarming
with Laser-Raptors.

141
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,760
I'll meet you at the God's drop.
Katana can help you get there.

142
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,100
Who's Katana?

143
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,920
<i>I'm Katana.</i>

144
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,420
I can give you a ride to Asgard.

145
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,080
A ride on what?

146
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,460
So, who are you?

147
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm a cop from the future.

148
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,340
I was sent back in time
to kill Hitler,

149
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,000
but I accidentally went
too far back in time

150
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,120
and ended up in this place.

151
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,720
I know someone
who might be able to help you.

152
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,960
Thor!

153
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,380
Behold! It is me, Thor!

154
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,520
Son of Odin
and protector of mankind.

155
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,420
Check out my pecs.

156
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,860
Your pecs are epic.

157
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>Thanks bro!</i>

158
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,200
So, anyway.

159
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,060
Thor, this is Kung Fury,
he's a cop from the future.

160
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,640
Yeah, I need to get to
Nazi Germany and kill Hitler...

161
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,040
- so if you could help me with--
- Stop!

162
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,240
Hammer time.

163
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,820
Walk through this portal and
you shall end up in Nazi Germany.

164
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
Good luck to you, Kung Fury!

165
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,800
Thanks Thor!

166
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,860
Well,
looks like this is my ride.

167
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,080
Hey, future cop,
where are you going?

168
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
You know what.
Here, take my number.

169
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,120
And use this phone to call me.

170
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,760
It's a personal, transportable,
cellular telephone.

171
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,980
<i>It features 645 channel
capacity,</i>

172
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,460
<i>10 number speed dial,
and an electronic security lock.</i>

173
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,000
<i>This revolution in communication
could make it possible</i>

174
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,960
for more and more people
to have a phone in their car!

175
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,940
Tank you.

176
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,040
I am the greatest Kung Fu master
of all time,

177
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,460
right guys?

178
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,380
<i>Thank you!</i>

179
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,980
I'm disarming you.

180
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,660
My arm! My arm!

181
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,680
Kill him!

182
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,120
You don't need that spine,

183
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,080
it's holding your back!

184
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,700
<i>A-ha!</i>

185
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,340
Fuck you Kung Fury.

186
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,820
Now nothing can stop me
and my army of death.

187
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,880
Thank you guys!

188
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,240
What the fuck?

189
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,520
Kill them!

190
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,480
Alright Hitler, the gig is up,
show me your hands.

191
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,060
Hackerman,
have you seen Kung Fury?

192
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,060
Oh, no! We were too late.

193
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,400
Who the hell are you?

194
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,720
My name is Cobra.

195
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,620
I've been expecting you,
Kung Fury.

196
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,720
I'm your spirit animal.

197
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,720
What the hell is this place?

198
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,080
This is heaven,
I'm afraid you're dead.

199
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:11,880
What?

200
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
But it looks so real.

201
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,180
Yeah, no, it's totally real.

202
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,740
Mr. Cobra, I'm a police officer

203
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,700
and I need you to send me
back to earth, pronto.

204
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,520
I'm sorry,
I can't help you with that.

205
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,200
You see, you're dead.

206
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,260
- You're under arrest!
- What?

207
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,640
For obstruction of justice,
you're breaking the law!

208
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,140
What the hell happened?

209
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,280
I hacked away all of
your bullet wounds Kung Fury.

210
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,160
Thanks!

211
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,800
I want to welcome you
and your friends to Germany.

212
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,800
We are not so different,
you and I.

213
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,720
I mean we both got
good style, you know?

214
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,580
With Red, you know?

215
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,180
So, that's cool!

216
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,880
We both like doing moves, yah!
Check it out, yah!

217
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,240
<i>Yah!</i>

218
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,480
Good, killing people, I love it,
you clearly do, too!

219
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,000
<i>And that's cool!</i>

220
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
Join me,

221
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,740
we could be brothers,
we are so alike.

222
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,700
It's almost like
we finish each other's...

223
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,080
- Balls.
- What?

224
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,260
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

225
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,880
The important thing is that
he is gone.

226
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
Sorry I doubted you Triceracop.

227
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,400
You're the best damn partner
I've ever had.

228
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,780
I came back in time
for you Kung Fury,

229
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,140
because, damn it,
I love you.

230
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,020
Team work is very important.

231
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,880
So, what happens now, Kung Fury?

232
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,960
Well, I need to
head back to the office.

233
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,360
Looks like it's gonna be
hell of a lot of paperwork.

234
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,140
Open the doors, Hoff.

235
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,360
I'm sorry Fury,
I can't let you do that.

236
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
Open the doors, Hoff!

237
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,580
I'm sorry, I can't let you
open the doors Kung Fury.

238
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,080
Goddammit, open the doors!

239
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,980
- I'm sorry I can't--
- Open the doors!

240
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,000
Did anyone ever tell you
not to hassle the Hoff 9000?

241
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,780
Oh, Hoff 9000,
you son of a bitch.

242
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,300
Piece of shit.

243
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,520
Oh, my,
not much left of him is there?

244
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,880
The important thing is that
he is gone.

245
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,860
Game over.

246
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,640
Wait a minute,

247
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,780
I've seen that symbol before...

248
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,760
somewhere.

249
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,800
Hitler!

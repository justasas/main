1
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,573
<i>Hull breach contained.</i>

2
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:51,708
<i>Engines operating</i>
<i>at 170% capacity.</i>

3
00:00:56,623 --> 00:01:01,060
<i>Engine and hull failure imminent</i>
<i>under current parameters.</i>

4
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,763
<i>A lot of questions,</i>
<i>whoever we run into.</i>

5
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,166
<i>Could even be... a merc ship.</i>

6
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,471
<i>Critical systems failure in five seconds.</i>

7
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,033
<i>Four seconds. Three seconds.</i>

8
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,308
<i>Two seconds. One second.</i>

9
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:28,286
First you're a boy, then you're a girl,
and now you're a psychic.

10
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,822
Careful what you wish for, Jack.

11
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,827
<i>Unidentified craft,</i>
<i>state your purpose and contents.</i>

12
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:45,633
<i>Unidentified craft,</i>
<i>state your purpose and contents.</i>

13
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,341
Unidentified craft,
state your purpose and contents.

14
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,815
Name's Johns.

15
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,115
<i>My ship got scrapped</i>
<i>on a transport run.</i>

16
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:05,317
<i>The only other survivors</i>
<i>from the whole mess are with me.</i>

17
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,417
<i>Outside of that, we got nothing.</i>

18
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,055
Tell me, Mr. Johns,

19
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:15,295
what brings you to this
lonely corner of space?

20
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:17,768
I'm a bounty hunter.

21
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:21,773
Then it appears
we have something in common.

22
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,578
Bring them in.

23
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:44,129
They're reelin' us in.

24
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,040
<i>Ship is secure in Bay 3.</i>

25
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,809
No offense, but I don't think
that's gonna cut it...

26
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,615
against whatever it is
that's coming for us.

27
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,888
Report.

28
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:20,660
Two heat signatures. Adults.

29
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,668
There's some residual as well.
Could be a juvenile.

30
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,931
More likely burn-off
from the engines.

31
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,371
Find out.

32
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:31,376
Hold your breath.

33
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,881
Running a tighter sweep.

34
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,648
- Wait a minute.
- What is it?

35
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:46,021
<i>It's the sweep.</i>
<i>According to what I'm getting,</i>

36
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,684
they're gone.

37
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,694
Gone?

38
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:53,027
Nothing inside that ship's
putting out heat anymore.

39
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,465
<i>How that's possible...</i>

40
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,219
Anything?

41
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,189
<i>No, sir. No one's been in or out</i>
<i>of this bay since I locked it down myself.</i>

42
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,192
Zero atmosphere.

43
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,395
<i>Pressurize.</i>

44
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,990
We've got O-2, sir. It's thin,
but you'll be able to breathe it.

45
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,197
- Green for breach.
- Earn your keep.

46
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,883
<i>There is a man inside this vessel</i>
<i>who is something far worse...</i>

47
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,853
than anyone here
has ever encountered.

48
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,754
Should you survive this day,

49
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:56,852
it is one you will remember
for the rest of your lives.

50
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,865
Do not underestimate
the importance of such a thing.

51
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,367
Begin.

52
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:51,116
Extinguishing foam.

53
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,618
Fall back!
Everyone fall back!

54
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,524
He has to breathe sometime.

55
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,781
You certainly know
how to make an entrance.

56
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:35,294
That's nothing, scarecrow.
He's gonna kick your ass so hard...

57
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:43,565
I think not.

58
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:47,902
- What do you say?
- Call off your lap dog,

59
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,535
before his trying to impress you
gets him killed.

60
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,045
Am I so obvious?

61
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:59,551
Call it what you want,
but tell him to stand down, now.

62
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,215
You'll have to excuse
Junner's excitement.

63
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,885
It sometimes makes him
a touch... quick.

64
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,019
Though I can't say I blame him.

65
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,031
You see, he's just heard
so much about you,

66
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,192
Riddick.

67
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,533
Yes, I know your name.

68
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,697
Quite a bit more
about you, I think.

69
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,210
Careful. You may find
what you're digging for.

70
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,940
I'm willing to share, of course,

71
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:31,381
but I must ask
that you surrender your weapon...

72
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:36,718
<i>before any more of my apparently</i>
<i>overpaid associates...</i>

73
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,724
<i>come to an untimely end.</i>

74
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:42,226
Not gonna happen.

75
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,728
No?

76
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,304
The girl is nothing to me.

77
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,396
Then enlighten me.

78
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,240
Why would a stone-cold killer
such as yourself...

79
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,803
<i>go to all the trouble</i>
<i>of keeping the likes of her alive?</i>

80
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,817
Unless, of course,
you've grown attached.

81
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,286
She's a cover story,
nothing more.

82
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,291
<i>You shoot her now,</i>
<i>and you'll be saving me the trouble.</i>

83
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,793
Then I have your blessing.

84
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,740
Maybe I know more about you
than you do yourself.

85
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,743
Now just ain't the time.

86
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:34,245
Lock them down.

87
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:40,248
<i>- We're done here.</i>
- My apologies.

88
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,550
You know how worthless
those are to me. You did well.

89
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,888
<i>People die</i>
<i>in this line of work, Junner.</i>

90
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,554
<i>A handful of men?</i>
<i>A small price to pay.</i>

91
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,464
- What will you do with him?
- Slowly, Junner.

92
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,059
Have Riddick brought
to my conservatory.

93
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,071
<i>I've something beautiful in mind.</i>

94
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:04,872
And, Junner,
unfreeze some more mercs.

95
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,890
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

96
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,897
Merc ships? Plenty.

97
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:29,901
<i>Just trying to figure out</i>
<i>how it all goes together.</i>

98
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:33,405
It is a plantation operation.

99
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:37,203
A boat like this loads up at port,
signs on as many men as it can hold,

100
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:41,713
then goes out for months,
sometimes years at a time.

101
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,147
However long it takes
to fill their stores.

102
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:48,152
Except a merchant rig's
usually harvesting ore,

103
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,586
<i>maybe crops, not people.</i>

104
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:56,117
<i> Captured bounties on one side,</i>
<i>contracted manpower on the other.</i>

105
00:09:56,195 --> 00:10:00,564
- Just add heat.
- You know a lot about this shit...

106
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,624
for a holy man.

107
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,636
I hear things.

108
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:09,403
<i>Must be a special kind</i>
<i>of desperate dick</i>
<i>signs on to this.</i>

109
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,636
Shut up!

110
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,147
<i>You're the exception, of course.</i>
<i>For you, it's life experience.</i>

111
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,989
So, what's the plan?

112
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,491
It's not like we haven't
gotten out of worse.

113
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,723
The way I see it, we can take
these jerks when... Hey!

114
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,698
- This is where we get off, princess.
- You too, preacher.

115
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,032
I will pray.
Not for me.

116
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,300
- Let's go!
- I won't leave without you, Riddick!

117
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,311
I'll find you!

118
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,785
Set him down and leave.

119
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,294
Hmm.

120
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,836
The hell...

121
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,450
All right.
Now you have my attention.

122
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,453
A necessary precaution.

123
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,456
You attempt anything uncivilized...

124
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,958
<i>killing me, for instance...</i>

125
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:11,963
I detonate the explosive charge
Junner's just implanted...

126
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,966
and sleep very well tonight.

127
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,968
Walk with me.

128
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,470
You're not putting me
on a pedestal.

129
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,701
No. Of course not.

130
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,711
<i>You're strictly</i>
<i>for my private collection.</i>

131
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,822
Miss me?

132
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,172
Mmm. Fresh as a daisy.

133
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,185
Suit up and report.

134
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:10,586
Must be something big,
them taking you off ice
after what you pulled.

135
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,558
Sister, I certainly aim
to find out.

136
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,922
Hmm. Okay.

137
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,058
You go through all the trouble
to catch these guys,

138
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,068
<i>and this is what</i>
<i>you do with them.</i>

139
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,127
<i>You're missing the point.</i>

140
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:30,403
<i> What point?</i>
<i>You got a million U.D.'s</i>
<i>standing around collectin' dust.</i>

141
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,344
You underestimate
their value, Riddick.
They are priceless.

142
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,677
Each, at one time,

143
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,708
the most wanted man
or woman in the known universe.

144
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,687
<i>The number of lives ended</i>
<i>at the hands of those...</i>

145
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:48,386
<i>living and breathing</i>
<i>in this room is incalculable.</i>

146
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,394
Ain't what I'd call living.

147
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:56,025
Just the same, I assure you
they are all very much alive.

148
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,401
<i>Each one sustained</i>
<i>in a form of cryo so profound...</i>

149
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,633
<i>that seconds seem weeks...</i>

150
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,643
<i>and to blink an eye is a day's work.</i>

151
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:10,148
<i>The brain, however,</i>
<i>continues to function unimpeded.</i>

152
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,946
<i>The mind continues</i>
<i>to think and feel,</i>

153
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,818
<i>swarming with whatever dark thoughts</i>
<i>it's trapped alone with,</i>

154
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,653
as it will be for hundreds of years.

155
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:24,662
<i>So much more fitting a fate than</i>
<i>dropping them off at the nearest slam.</i>

156
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,757
<i>Here, they are appreciated</i>
<i>for what they truly are,</i>

157
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:32,736
<i>transformed into objects</i>
<i>on par with their lives’ work.</i>

158
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,902
And why? Because I gave them the
audience they so desperately desired,

159
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,741
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

160
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:46,251
I understood their actions,
stripped free of moral convention.

161
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,754
Don't you see? They're
something greater now, Riddick.

162
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:54,259
Something more than
they ever were before. Art.

163
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,921
Lady, your taste sucks.

164
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,431
I expected as much.

165
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:03,229
Junner.

166
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,650
You see, Riddick,

167
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,187
there is a fundamental difference
between you and I.

168
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,588
Yeah. You're a psychopath.

169
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,151
You don't appreciate art.

170
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,756
But I believe the reason for this
is something very different...

171
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:36,096
than you or anyone else
might think.

172
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,796
You're an artist.

173
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,102
I've been called
a lot of things in my day.

174
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,108
That ain't one of 'em.

175
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,873
You make art, Riddick,
not analyze it.

176
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,111
You shape it with your own hands,
carve it from flesh and bone.

177
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,951
But a man like you does not understand
such a thing by being lectured.

178
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,820
You must experience it.

179
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:05,129
Oh, shit.

180
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,104
I said I'd find you, didn't I?

181
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,505
What do you want?
To watch you work.

182
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:21,308
I've spent the latter half of my life
observing fantastic things...

183
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,316
the work of terrible men,
men such as yourself...

184
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,512
but it's always after the fact...

185
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:32,523
when the moment of bloody creation
is cold and passed.

186
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,786
That changes now.

187
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,605
I need to see it, Riddick.

188
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,610
I need to see it with my own eyes
as it happens.

189
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,613
I get outta there alive,
you'll see it again...

190
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,615
this close.

191
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:03,616
No, Riddick.
I want your masterpiece.

192
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:10,050
An artist is nothing
without his instrument.

193
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:18,500
When we meet again,
I'm gonna bury this in your eye.

194
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,510
<i>Let him in.</i>

195
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,524
Go ultraviolet.

196
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,141
I was on a pilgrimage.
Just a pilgrimage.

197
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:01,077
- This is bad, huh?
- Give it a minute.

198
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,141
Imam, pray.

199
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,178
Get her on her feet.

200
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:21,022
I cannot see!
You don't want to.

201
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,933
You wanna go?
Let's go.

202
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,444
Beautiful, beautiful creature.

203
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,777
Shrill are an exquisite species.

204
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,443
I'm talking about the man.

205
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,927
They're gonna kill him!

206
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:16,675
Huh?

207
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:20,343
No!

208
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:32,295
- Riddick?
- Here!

209
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,518
Bravo!
The grace, the expression,

210
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,614
the sheer violence of it.

211
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,625
Exquisite.

212
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,127
- Give...
- What?

213
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,632
Give me the knife.

214
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,497
Such a complete
and thorough performance.

215
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,697
It leaves only one question.

216
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,104
I got a feeling
you're not gonna like it.

217
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,540
How will I ever have you mounted...

218
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,547
to do it justice?

219
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,350
What are you...

220
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,355
No!

221
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,025
Eww!

222
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:40,960
- You gonna keep that?
- Looks like you'll have to
be an abstract piece.

223
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,025
Down! Now!

224
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,238
We'll need to rouse
a substantial pursuit force.

225
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,044
- Who?
- All of them! Even the Galls!

226
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,414
Any man or thing
that can hold a weapon!

227
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,387
Every last one! Now!

228
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,611
All right.
Just what's the big deal? Oh!

229
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,017
Jumping Jesus.

230
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:40,855
<i>Oh, come to Papa,</i>
<i>you beautiful bald bastard.</i>

231
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,588
<i>Toombs, what in the hell</i>
<i>are you doing?</i>

232
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,596
Just gathering intel.

233
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,598
Yeah, well, stow it.
We got a couple
of runners to bring in.

234
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,861
- Shoot on sight.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,852
What in the hell
happened here?

236
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,622
Shut up and take point.

237
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,237
Burn 'em.
Grab your panties, boys.

238
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,517
What the hell was that?

239
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,955
Don't move.

240
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,566
Turn it loose.

241
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,545
Huh?

242
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,011
What the...

243
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,794
- You're badly hurt.
- Him? He almost tore me in half.

244
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,296
Just a graze this time.

245
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:41,277
That bitch. Move!

246
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,282
We cannot stop.
We're not outrunning
this thing,

247
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,292
not the three of us.

248
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,294
What? I can keep up!

249
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,728
Maybe someday.

250
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:07,902
- Get her to the flight deck.
- It's just aft, upper level.

251
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:12,376
Yeah. Stow in there and let
whatever's following pass.

252
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,436
When it does,
make for the flight deck
and don't look back,

253
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:18,381
no matter what you hear.

254
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,352
<i>We'll wait for you.</i>
Follow Imam.

255
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,856
What are you going to do?

256
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:50,211
Now where do we gotta go
to meet up with Ridd...

257
00:25:50,282 --> 00:25:52,341
Jack, shh.

258
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,707
We've got to help him, Imam.

259
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,709
We can't help him if we leave.

260
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,712
Sometimes that is exactly
how it works.

261
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,952
Sweep it.

262
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,956
I got something.
Check it out.

263
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,754
- Don't touch that!
- Oh, shit.

264
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,730
I ain't putting that back on.

265
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:47,230
<i>Let her go.</i>
Hmm.

266
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:52,393
It's me you're after.
You want a shot at the title?

267
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,216
I told you that was coming.

268
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:53,690
Wh-Where are you going?

269
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:57,194
Gonna prep this ship
and get off this heap.

270
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:00,789
So <i>we</i> can escape?

271
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:12,435
It is over.

272
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,444
<i>We have survived.</i>

273
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:23,312
Back to hell with you,

274
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:27,825
you bloody stinking savage!

275
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,668
Im...

276
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,674
Yeah, we made it.

277
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,581
Awfully uncivilized thing
you just did there, Jack.

278
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,326
Riddick.
Trouble?

279
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,094
Yes.

280
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,432
It is nothing back there.

281
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:15,097
What worries me
lies ahead of us.

282
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:19,803
- Jack.
<i>- I am concerned for her, Riddick,</i>

283
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,813
<i>that she'll become...</i>

284
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,576
Like me.

285
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:43,065
- What is that place?
- That's nowhere.

286
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:48,071
I'm dropping you guys
on New Mecca.

287
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,147
Riddick.
We ain't done, boy.

288
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,278
Not by a long shot.

289
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:13,592
<i>Hold your breath.</i>

290
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:18,830
<i>There is a man inside this vessel</i>
<i>who is something far worse...</i>

291
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:22,839
<i>than anyone here</i>
<i>has ever encountered.</i>

292
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,004
<i>Hold your breath.</i>

293
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,479
<i>Should you survive this day,</i>

294
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:34,917
<i>it is one you will remember</i>
<i>for the rest of your life.</i>

295
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:40,185
<i>Do not underestimate</i>
<i>the importance of such a thing.</i>

296
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,988
<i>Hold your breath.</i>

297
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,156
<i>Fall back. Everyone fall back.</i>

298
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:21,390
<i>Here, they are appreciated</i>
<i>for what they truly are,</i>

299
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:26,123
<i>transformed into objects on par</i>
<i>with their lives’ work.</i>

300
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:35,132
<i>Because I gave them the audience</i>
<i>they so desperately desired,</i>

301
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,834
<i>the recognition they bought</i>
<i>with the blood of others.</i>

19

My ship got scrapped

The only other survivors

21

Outside of that, we got nothing.

Tell me, Mr. Johns,

23
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:09,831
what brings you to this
lonely corner of space?

There's some residual as well.
Could be a juvenile.

34

More likely burn-off
from the engines.

It's the sweep.
According to what I'm getting,

40
00:03:36,952 --> 00:03:38,480
they're gone.

00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,750
No, sir. No one's been in or out

Call it what you want,

You'll have to excuse

It sometimes makes him
a touch... quick.

about you, I think.

Careful. You may find
what you're digging for.

I'm willing to share, of course,

113
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:10,203
It is a plantation operation.

114
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:13,847
A boat like this loads up at port,
signs on as many men as it can hold,

115
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:18,174

- You too, preacher.

130

Not for me.

All right.
Now you have my attention.

140
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,216
A necessary precaution.

141
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:36,097
You attempt anything uncivilized...

142
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,498
killing me, for instance...

143
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:42,341
I detonate the explosive charge
Junner's just implanted...

144
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:45,222
and sleep very well tonight.

145
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,143
Walk with me.

146
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:49,544
You're not putting me
on a pedestal.

147
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,644
No. Of course not.

Mmm. Fresh as a daisy.

Suit up and report.

153
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:38,590
Must be something big, them taking
you off ice after what you pulled.

154
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:42,402
Sister, I certainly aim
to find out.

155
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,589
Hmm. Okay.

156
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:49,598
You go through all the trouble
to catch these guys,

157
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:51,527
and this is what
you do with them.

158
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,502
[Woman]
You're missing the point.

159
00:12:53,577 --> 00:12:57,605
[Riddick] What point? You got a million
U.D. 's standing around collectin'dust.

160
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,386
You underestimate their value,
Riddick. They are priceless.

161
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,625
Each, at one time,

162
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:07,493
the most wanted man
or woman in the known universe.

163
00:13:07,568 --> 00:13:10,351
The number oflives ended
at the hands of those...

164
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:14,860
living and breathing
in this room is incalculable.

165
00:13:14,931 --> 00:13:16,787
Ain't what I'd call living.

166
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:22,190
Just the same, I assure you
they are all very much alive.

167
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:26,388
Each one sustained
in a form of cryo so profound...

168
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,530
that seconds seem weeks...

169
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:31,418
and to blink an eye is a day's work.

170
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:35,741
The brain, however,
continues to function unimpeded.

171
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:38,426
The mind continues
to think and feel,

172
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:42,141
swarming with whatever dark thoughts
it's trapped alone with,

173
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:44,861
as it will be for hundreds of years.

174
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,667
So much more fitting a fate than
dropping them off at the nearest slam.

175
00:13:49,732 --> 00:13:53,596
Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

176
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,414
transformed into objects
on par with their lives'work.

177
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,371
And why? Because I gave them the
audience they so desperately desired,

178
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,095
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

179
00:14:05,164 --> 00:14:10,382
I understood their actions,
stripped free of moral convention.

180
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,743
Don't you see? They're
something greater now, Riddick.

181
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:18,066
Something more than
they ever were before. Art.

182
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,580
Lady, your taste sucks.

183
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,988
I expected as much.

184
00:14:24,053 --> 00:14:26,673
Junner.

185
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,388
You see, Riddick,

186
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:45,823
there is a fundamental difference
between you and I.

187
00:14:45,888 --> 00:14:49,086
Yeah. You're a psychopath.

188
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,505
You don't appreciate art.

189
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,964
But I believe the reason for this
is something very different...

190
00:14:56,037 --> 00:14:58,209
than you or anyone else
might think.

191
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,800
You're an artist.

192
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:03,972
I've been called
a lot of things in my day.

193
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,896
That ain't one of'em.

194
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:09,509
You make art, Riddick,
not analyze it.

195
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,575
You shape it with your own hands,
carve it from flesh and bone.

196
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:18,219
But a man like you does not understand
such a thing by being lectured.

197
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:20,972
You must experience it.

198
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,066
Oh, shit.

199
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:33,718
I said I'd find you, didn't I?

200
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:36,982
What do you want?
To watch you work.

201
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:41,590
I've spent the latter half of my life
observing fantastic things...

202
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:45,436
the work of terrible men,
men such as yourself...

203
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:48,503
but it's always after the fact...

204
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:52,351
when the moment of bloody creation
is cold and passed.

205
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:54,523
That changes now.

[Gasps, Whimpers]

207
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,823
I need to see it, Riddick.

208
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:11,625
I need to see it with my own eyes
as it happens.

209
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,506
I get outta there alive,
you'll see it again...

210
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,427
this close.

211
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:22,185
No, Riddick.
I want your masterpiece.

212
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,359
An artist is nothing
without his instrument.

213
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:36,467
When we meet again,
I'm gonna bury this in your eye.

I was on a pilgrimage.
Just a pilgrimage.

- Give...
- What?

244
00:20:13,025 --> 00:20:16,321
Give me the knife.

245

Such a complete
and thorough performance.

Fall back. Everyone fall back.

353
00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:57,941
[Woman] Here, they are appreciated
for what they truly are,

354
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:02,482
transformed into objects on par
with their lives'work.

355
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:11,127
Because I gave them the audience
they so desperately desired,

356
00:33:12,254 --> 00:33:15,638
the recognition they bought
with the blood of others.

1
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,068
What do you say, kid?
Are we moving in?

2
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,764
How many times
do you want me to say yes?

3
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:36,839
Every time you say it
is like the first time.

4
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:40,972
My heart starts beating
like I just ran around the block.

5
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:45,411
Those slippery rugs are out.
A guy could break his neck on those.

6
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:48,489
Mr. Wilson, do you plan
doing a lot of running around?

7
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:50,523
Yeah, after you.

8
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,957
- The rugs are out.
- And the twin beds too.

9
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,120
Out like a light.

10
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:57,289
Hey, I like peanuts too.

11
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:59,833
- I thought you hated them.
- I did once.

12
00:02:00,002 --> 00:02:01,970
What changed your mind?

13
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,629
I love you. You love peanuts.

14
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:06,832
I love peanuts too.

15
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:09,705
Well, I guess that wins.

16
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,146
It's raining.

17
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,808
Gee, it feels swell
against your face.

18
00:02:16,986 --> 00:02:19,511
Tonight of all nights it's gotta rain.

19
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,850
Don't talk about it.

20
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:24,015
What am I gonna do
after you've gone?

21
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,058
Joe.

22
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,498
I'll be walking like this
down a street.

23
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,533
- Where are you?
- I'll be here.

24
00:03:01,464 --> 00:03:03,364
Twenty cents.

25
00:03:11,407 --> 00:03:14,399
- How do you like that?
- Oh, dear.

26
00:03:14,577 --> 00:03:16,477
Here, give me.

27
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:24,777
Don't.

28
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:29,384
What are you gonna do?

29
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,618
Oh, here it is.

30
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,753
- Come on, I'll sew it.
- Here? No, no.

31
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,399
- You'll let it go. I know.
- Honest, I won't.

32
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,092
- You know you will.
- No, I'll sew it myself.

33
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,534
- I won't forget it, darling.
- Sit down.

34
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:47,499
Sit down.

35
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,737
There's a lot of people around.

36
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:58,581
Joe.

37
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:01,946
I've only got blue thread.

38
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:05,593
- Blue?
- Yep. Blue.

39
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:11,327
Train number 19 leaving for De Kalb.

40
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:15,334
- There. You hear? That's your train.
- That's not my train. Sit down.

41
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:20,071
- I'm hard to get rid of.
- Like my right arm.

42
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,803
Only I need you more.

43
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,939
Oh, Kat.

44
00:04:28,251 --> 00:04:31,414
I'll come for you as soon
as I get that old bank account...

45
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:34,784
...up to the third floor
and a kitchenette.

46
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:38,683
This waiting is awful.

47
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,352
After all, we're human.

48
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,261
Why can't you stay
with your job here?

49
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:51,201
- At least we...
- We've been through that, darling.

50
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:56,004
There's a better job there,
and I'll be saving for us too.

51
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:02,010
I know.

52
00:05:05,187 --> 00:05:10,853
Train number 27 leaving
for Galesburg and all points west.

53
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:18,993
- Give me some of those peanuts too.
- Yes, sir.

54
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:23,005
- How much for that "smellum"?
- That one there?

55
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,834
Take it easy on yourself now.

56
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:27,669
Four dollars.

57
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:30,403
Not for me, wise guy.
It's for a girl. How much?

58
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,046
Five even.

59
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,153
I got you a little mementum.

60
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:43,086
"Memento," darling. "To," not "tum."

61
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,692
How often have I told you?

62
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,556
It's from wearing braces on my teeth
when I was a kid.

63
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:50,664
You're still a kid. A lot of you is...

64
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,892
...and I love it.

65
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:54,696
I love you.

66
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,407
I got a memento for you too.

67
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,275
Look inside.

68
00:06:06,148 --> 00:06:09,777
"Henry to Katherine."

69
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,921
It was my mother's wedding ring.
I was named after her.

70
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,751
So I...

71
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:21,356
- Turn it around.
- "Katherine to Joe."

72
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:22,929
Oh, Kat...

73
00:06:27,737 --> 00:06:31,229
I guess I'll have to wear it
on my little finger.

74
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,901
All aboard!

75
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,740
I'll come for you soon.

76
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,248
Soon, Joe.

77
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,284
Soon.

78
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,229
Hello, stranger.

79
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:41,770
Think you're smart, don't you?
How do you like this, big shot?

80
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,809
How's that?

81
00:07:46,015 --> 00:07:48,040
You look the way I feel.

82
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,013
Lonely and small.

83
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:52,620
Come on.

84
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,291
Quiet.

85
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,691
That Charlie,
always leaving the light on.

86
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,356
Straight ahead.

87
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,586
- Charlie, now, I'm all right.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

88
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:37,695
Come on, hold it now. Hold it.

89
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,929
- Charlie, where'd you get the dog?
- There's no dog. You're drunk.

90
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:47,102
- So you went to a movie?
- Hello, Joe.

91
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:51,012
- Katherine get away all right?
- Yeah.

92
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:54,341
That's fine. I'm fine too.

93
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,679
I feel awful.

94
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:04,690
Now, listen, Charlie...

95
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,851
We had a couple drinks
after the show.

96
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:09,361
Kid's gotta have fun.
He just can't take it.

97
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,931
Who said I can't take it?

98
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,863
- I'm all right.
- All right, Tommy. Sure you are.

99
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:17,870
- All right, kid.
- Even Mr. Donelli said I was all right.

100
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,736
- Donelli?
- All right. I've been waiting for it.

101
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,107
Waiting for an undertaker or cops,
the life you're leading.

102
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,646
Running errands for that racketeer.

103
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,374
Let me tell you, Charlie,
leave Tom out of it.

104
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:31,213
Joe, I know, I know.

105
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,947
We met Donelli,
and he invited us up for drinks.

106
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,818
Better Tom meets someone
who can do him some good.

107
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,892
Do him some good?

108
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:44,932
I'm glad Mom and Dad aren't here
to see the good you're doing yourself.

109
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,796
Can that Sunday-school talk.

110
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:52,138
Think I'm gonna ride to heaven
on 30 a week from a sweatshop?

111
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:54,742
Be a working stiff all my life,
like you?

112
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,674
- Times have changed.
- You bet times have changed.

113
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,178
The people are against
you monkeys now.

114
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,748
The people ain't doing so good either.

115
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,943
I don't know what's so hot about you.

116
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,016
Crazy in love with a swell gal
and can't make enough to get married.

117
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,991
- Leave Katherine out of it!
- Leave me out. Stop living my life.

118
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:16,130
I wouldn't live your life
for all the money in the world.

119
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,266
Okay, Reverend. Okay.

120
00:12:46,315 --> 00:12:49,409
"Memento," darling. "Memento."

121
00:13:34,163 --> 00:13:36,131
Soon.

122
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:40,332
Come in.

123
00:13:40,502 --> 00:13:42,993
It's a special delivery
this time, Miss Grant.

124
00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,197
- I hope nothing's happened.
- Oh, no.

125
00:13:45,374 --> 00:13:51,006
They come faster than when I was a girl,
but I guess the insides don't change.

126
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,876
- He's coming, Mrs. Whipple!
- No.

127
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,315
Wedding, marriage license.

128
00:13:58,487 --> 00:13:59,977
He's bought a car.

129
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:01,713
Look.

130
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:09,058
- Be sure and kiss Katherine for me.
- Happy landings, fella.

131
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,223
Don't let the Indians
get you out there.

132
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,895
You keep your chin clean.
Look after the kid.

133
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:19,131
You can trust me.
Rainbow, take care of Joe.

134
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,267
- Goodbye, boys.
- So long, Joe.

135
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,742
- Is there gas in it? Bye-bye.
- All right.

136
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:43,258
War and crime.

137
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,695
Strikes, taxes.

138
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:49,304
And some weenies for his dog
and an avocado for him.

139
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,805
They call them alligator pears back East,
cost a fortune. Think he'll like them?

140
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,036
He won't know what he's eating
for being with you again.

141
00:14:57,212 --> 00:14:58,975
What time will I make lunch for?

142
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:02,241
I'm leaving for Sycamore Corners
by bus on the main road.

143
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,875
I wrote him to meet me there
at 11:00 at that hot dog stand.

144
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,318
We'll be back by noon sure.

145
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:12,185
Golly, Mrs. Whipple,
I can hardly stand it.

146
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:14,227
Over a year now.

147
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:26,632
Stop your motor, buddy.

148
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:29,504
Get both hands up
on that wheel there.

149
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,810
What is this, a holdup?

150
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,245
- No grass growing under them tires, eh?
- I wasn't speeding.

151
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:38,352
- And Illinois license plates?
- Yeah, sure. Chicago.

152
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,112
Get that fist up there.

153
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:43,486
Hey, I haven't got any gun
if that's what you mean.

154
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:45,923
- Peanuts won't kill you.
- Salted peanuts?

155
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:49,120
- Yeah, why?
- I ain't answering the questions, buddy.

156
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:51,027
You are. Come on, get out.

157
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,330
Where were you last night,
Mr. Wilson?

158
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,029
If you don't mind.

159
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,470
- I drove all night.
- On that old road?

160
00:16:00,642 --> 00:16:03,475
I got lost trying to find
a shortcut to Capital City.

161
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:06,273
- And the night before last?
- Camping out.

162
00:16:06,448 --> 00:16:11,351
Sorry to take up so much of your time,
but... Excuse me a second.

163
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,624
- Smoke?
- No, thanks.

164
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,030
Some peanuts?

165
00:16:33,342 --> 00:16:35,469
Now you're talking
my language, sheriff.

166
00:16:35,644 --> 00:16:37,635
I've had that habit
since I was a kid.

167
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:42,613
My old man used to bring them to me.
I got used to having them around.

168
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,148
Yes, sir.

169
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:47,288
- Always find peanuts in my pocket.
- Wilson...

170
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:50,323
...where did you say
you spent the night before last?

171
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:52,892
- Camping out.
- Why?

172
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,552
Why? For the...

173
00:16:56,231 --> 00:17:00,634
Is it a crime to get fresh air for yourself
when you've been stuck in a ci...?

174
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:04,431
Hey, look. What am I
suspected of anyway?

175
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,939
- I got a right to know.
- Sure.

176
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:17,377
Me? Why, that's the craziest thing
I ever heard. That'd fit a million men.

177
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:22,089
Read that.

178
00:17:26,261 --> 00:17:28,923
Am I the only guy in the world
that eats peanuts?

179
00:17:29,097 --> 00:17:33,693
- Why, you just...
- I never ate peanuts in my life.

180
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:41,104
I get it.

181
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,268
Why don't you check?
Get my brothers on the phone...

182
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,607
...in Chicago...
- We'll check all right.

183
00:17:46,782 --> 00:17:49,046
That's what I'm here for.

184
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:53,550
- Mind showing me your pockets?
- I should say not.

185
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:56,020
I don't mind, I mean.
He knows what I got.

186
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,285
Keys, handkerchiefs...

187
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,492
...my license, money,
what there is of it.

188
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,328
Pipe, tobacco, matches.

189
00:18:09,204 --> 00:18:11,536
- And peanuts.
- Bugs.

190
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:17,173
- Quiet, Rainbow.
- Check those bills...

191
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:20,007
...against the numbers
of these ransom banknotes.

192
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,481
You've come to the right man, chief.

193
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:28,851
- Sure he's only gonna check those?
- You're probably right as rain, Wilson.

194
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:36,326
Take a look under the five-dollar series.
Q 49677308 Z.

195
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:39,558
And on his bill the same thing.
Q 49677308 Z.

196
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,599
That can't be. That's impossible.

197
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,261
Rip up that car of his.
Might be more of them.

198
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:48,102
- Man, is this gonna be a sensation.
- Keep it to yourself.

199
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:50,972
And keep that dog quiet.

200
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,973
- Good morning.
- Hello.

201
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,887
Anybody here?

202
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:11,055
Any good-looking man from Illinois
looking for a good-looking girl here?

203
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,634
- Where's the good-looking girl?
- She'll be along in a minute.

204
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:18,136
Well, the good-looking
young fella ain't here yet either.

205
00:19:18,306 --> 00:19:20,399
He will be.

206
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,942
Well, will you let me
phone Chicago then?

207
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,438
Or better, I can phone my...

208
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,745
- Phone your what?
- Phone my brothers.

209
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,981
If you're mixed up with this gang,
it wouldn't be smart of me to let you.

210
00:19:36,158 --> 00:19:40,652
Look, sheriff. I got the bill some place
in change. I don't know where I got it.

211
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,992
Maybe I got it at a store
or a gas station or some place.

212
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,634
Take me back over the road.
I can prove...

213
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:49,235
Not a thing in the car. Not a thing.

214
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:53,431
Take care of this stranger, Frank.
Go through his clothes.

215
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,543
Sure you haven't forgot anything,
Wilson?

216
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,280
Yeah.

217
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,176
There's my watch.

218
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,944
The ring. It's too tight. I can't get it off.
Cut it off. Why not?

219
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,112
I've gotta hold you, Wilson,
for the district attorney.

220
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,623
But you'll get a square deal.

221
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:14,056
- Come on.
- You can type that now, Myrtle.

222
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:18,462
Quiet, Rainbow.

223
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,500
- She'll be all right, sheriff.
- Okay.

224
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:28,140
- Looks like we got ahold of something.
- Yeah.

225
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,279
- Be at the barbershop if you want me.
- Okay.

226
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:35,109
Let me tell you, professor, if you
young geniuses at the high school...

227
00:20:35,283 --> 00:20:37,945
...fill our children's heads
with radical ideas...

228
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,021
...we parents will have to get a law.
- Not possible to get a law...

229
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,990
...that denies the right to say what
one believes, in peace times anyway.

230
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,187
- Who says so?
- The Constitution of the United States.

231
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:51,161
I don't believe it.

232
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,234
You should read it sometime.
You would be surprised.

233
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:56,495
Well, that's enough
of that now, Sven.

234
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,196
I had to read it
to become an American.

235
00:20:59,374 --> 00:21:02,400
You never had to
because you was born here.

236
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:07,142
Hello, Meyers? Anything new
on this awful Peabody case?

237
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,178
I don't know.

238
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:15,049
You public servants quit playing cards.
Maybe you'd bring somebody to justice.

239
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,586
What'd you say if I raked in
a guy this morning...

240
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,059
...might know something
about them kidnappers? Yeah.

241
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,758
What do you suppose it is makes people
do things like snatching that kid?

242
00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:28,994
Nutty, I guess.

243
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,070
Now, I'll tell you.

244
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:35,709
People get funny impulses.

245
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,778
If you resist them, you're sane...

246
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:43,441
...if you don't, you're on your way
to the nuthouse or the pen.

247
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:46,621
At the taxpayers' expense.

248
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:52,283
Mr. Jorganson, you've got one
of the levelest heads in the county.

249
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,124
Would you believe that in the 20 years
that I've been stroking this razor...

250
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,290
...across throats here...

251
00:21:59,467 --> 00:22:03,198
...that many a time
I've had an impulse...

252
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:08,240
...to cut their
Adam's apples wide open?

253
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:12,775
Just like that.

254
00:22:14,382 --> 00:22:16,441
Yes, sir.

255
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,288
How about it, Hec?
Do you feel an impulse coming on?

256
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,058
An impulse is an impulse.

257
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:32,325
It's like an itch. You gotta scratch it.

258
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,649
Hello?

259
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,412
What's that, Hector?

260
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:55,451
My oldest customer.

261
00:22:55,623 --> 00:22:59,081
All on account of that Bugs Meyers
from the sheriff's office...

262
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,286
...telling a cock-and-bull story
about his capturing...

263
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:07,367
...one of that Peabody kidnapping gang.
- I got something on the stove, precious.

264
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:10,368
Call you back. Bye-bye.

265
00:23:16,644 --> 00:23:18,976
Mrs. Tuttle! Mrs. Tuttle!

266
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,547
- Of all things.
- For mercy's sake, what is it?

267
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,719
Just wait. My husband phoned me.
They've arrested a man.

268
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:28,253
And they think he's
one of the kidnappers.

269
00:23:38,566 --> 00:23:39,897
Fanny!

270
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:44,368
That barber's wife says this morning
they caught a man on the old road...

271
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,873
...who they suspect knows
something about this kidnapping.

272
00:23:49,043 --> 00:23:52,638
I got it on the highest authority
that they arrested...

273
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:55,749
...one of that kidnapping gang.
- You don't say.

274
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,818
He tried to escape,
but they captured him all right.

275
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,478
- Oh, I'll have three of those.
- Oh, come on.

276
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:04,056
- And a pound of prunes.
- What's his name?

277
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:06,386
- Who was he?
- What else?

278
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:10,725
Well, I can't tell you any more. It was
told me in the strictest confidence.

279
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,094
Fanny, that isn't fair.
Please. Come on.

280
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:17,670
But, darling, you know
I'm as silent as a tomb.

281
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,209
But are you sure he's not innocent?

282
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,440
My dear young woman,
in this country...

283
00:24:28,616 --> 00:24:32,552
...people don't land in jail
unless they're guilty.

284
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,183
My wife's sister called up and told her
that a friend of hers told her...

285
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,794
...that this guy acted
as cocky as a bronco.

286
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,932
All he'd answer was,
"Let me phone my lawyer."

287
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,932
Sure. That's the racket
of those bigtime attorneys.

288
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:49,933
Helping these skunks beat the law.

289
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:52,868
Well, they won't beat it
with any jury I'm ever on.

290
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:55,976
If all us people had the courage
of our convictions...

291
00:24:56,144 --> 00:25:00,274
...these vermin would vanish
like spit on a hot stove.

292
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,288
Set them up for the boys, Oscar.

293
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,562
Four beers.

294
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:18,290
Last time after you played
that slot machine...

295
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,559
...it was full of telephone slugs.

296
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:22,498
Now, ain't that a shame.

297
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:24,668
Say, Dawson...

298
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:28,172
...I hear they gave that guy
your favorite cell at the jail.

299
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,004
Next time I'm in,
it'll be for beating you up.

300
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,079
All right, big shot.

301
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:36,181
While I didn't vote
for Hummel for sheriff...

302
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:39,649
...his promptness in catching
this kidnapper is commendable.

303
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:43,757
They can't bring him to trial
any too quickly to suit me.

304
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:47,420
- If you don't mind.
- Well, excuse me for living.

305
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:50,086
- Mr. Pippen.
- Hello, George.

306
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:53,291
- I have some fine, new English flannel.
- Later, Durkin.

307
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,335
- Yes, as you wish.
- My usual, Oscar.

308
00:25:56,504 --> 00:26:00,133
We were discussing down
at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon...

309
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:05,336
We were discussing at the luncheon
about what a great publicity break...

310
00:26:06,614 --> 00:26:10,106
What a great publicity break
our capturing this Chicago fellow...

311
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:15,689
...is gonna give our little city, assuming
of course the citizens, leading citizens...

312
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,890
See that he's brought to justice.

313
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,552
We'll take care of that,
all right, all right.

314
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,994
We'll go to the sheriff,
get it from him.

315
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,158
Boys, that's a great idea.
I'll go with you.

316
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,304
Hey! Hey, jailer.

317
00:26:32,473 --> 00:26:35,237
- Has the sheriff phoned my brothers yet?
- I don't know.

318
00:26:35,443 --> 00:26:39,846
But you'll hear something
one way or the other in due time.

319
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:51,483
I'm trying to locate the district attorney.
We'll get the truth as soon as possible.

320
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:54,685
But till we do, one way or other...

321
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:57,353
...l've no right to make a statement.

322
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,999
Ordinarily, sheriff, yes.

323
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:02,363
But there's a nervous
feeling about town.

324
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:04,299
Yes, sheriff.

325
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,463
And the community feels that...

326
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:08,506
We got a right to know
about him.

327
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,544
I don't know yet that he is
a kidnapper, so neither do you.

328
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,205
What are you trying to do, Hummel?

329
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:19,217
- Protect this weasel?
- That's pretty comical, you cockroach.

330
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,446
You teaching me law and order.

331
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:25,115
You've been stirrings up trouble
for law and order hereabouts...

332
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:27,989
...ever since you put on long pants.

333
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:33,129
Anything more I can do
for you gentlemen?

334
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,565
Here, let me talk.
No offense meant.

335
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:40,299
I'm sure, sheriff, we can count on you
keeping everything shipshape, I'm sure.

336
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:41,840
Good afternoon.

337
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:44,171
But I would like to...

338
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,908
Good day, sheriff.

339
00:27:48,016 --> 00:27:51,179
- Goodbye, sheriff.
- Well, good day.

340
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:56,590
It's an outrage a man can't stand up
for law and order...

341
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,487
Men do stand up for it.

342
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:02,221
I'll tell you one thing, Hummel.
My friends won't be satisfied...

343
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:05,560
...with what those pillars
of society have to tell them.

344
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:08,896
An attack on a girl hits us
ordinary people where we live.

345
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,698
We're gonna see that politics
don't cut any ice.

346
00:28:11,873 --> 00:28:16,173
I'm gonna see that a lot
of half-baked rumors don't either.

347
00:28:16,344 --> 00:28:20,542
Now hightail out of here
and behave yourself...

348
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:26,017
...or I'll have the county take you
and all your relatives off the dole.

349
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:11,062
Myrtle, get the governor
on the phone.

350
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:16,135
I'll have the National Guard ready
for any merited emergency.

351
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,328
Oh, I'm sure you will.

352
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:20,201
Keep me informed.

353
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,839
I hope nothing's happened.
It's the first time he's come West, so...

354
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:30,006
I ain't heard of anyone being tomahawked
or scalped in the neighborhood in a while.

355
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:33,085
The sheriff's wrong
not to give us the facts.

356
00:29:33,287 --> 00:29:36,620
What'd they rip his car up for
unless it was to find ransom dough?

357
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,692
I heard there was 5000
in tens, twenties, fifties...

358
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,853
- Ten thousand, they told me.
- It was a lot of money.

359
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,022
First thing he did was phone
Chicago for his lawyer.

360
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:49,169
That's always the first thing
a guy like that will do.

361
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:54,936
Maybe he gave the money
to the sheriff to go free on bail.

362
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:58,044
- Shut up, Goofy.
- There's Bugs. He ought to know.

363
00:29:58,246 --> 00:29:59,770
- Let's ask.
- That's an idea.

364
00:29:59,947 --> 00:30:04,043
- Bring him in and give him a drink.
- Come on, gang. Let's go and get him.

365
00:30:12,493 --> 00:30:14,791
Remember, just one.

366
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:18,394
Hooray for Bugsy!

367
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,864
- Give us the dope, Bugsy.
- Come on, Bugs.

368
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:27,201
- He knows all about it.
- Say, what's biting you fellas?

369
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,343
- What do you wanna know?
- There's an argument about...

370
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:34,470
...the amount the sheriff
found in that kidnapper's car.

371
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,177
- I hate to disappoint you guys.
- Come on, Bugsy.

372
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:41,014
We didn't find nothing.
We ripped it up...

373
00:30:41,189 --> 00:30:43,282
Go on, we know
you found ransom money.

374
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:48,758
- Yeah, ten grand hid under the seat.
- Ten grand, me eye.

375
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,764
Why, all Wilson had on him of
the ransom money was a five-dollar bill.

376
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,765
Who does that make a liar out of?

377
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,370
Wait'll I shove it down
the sheriff's throat.

378
00:30:57,538 --> 00:30:59,369
Come on.
Let's give him a serenade.

379
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,940
- Yeah, Dawson's right.
- Attaboy!

380
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:11,842
Quiet. Quiet, I say! Quiet!

381
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:14,544
Everybody's getting too excited.

382
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:16,747
The sheriff's okay.

383
00:31:16,924 --> 00:31:18,755
- This is none of our business.
- No?

384
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:22,453
I'll tell you, if I lived in this town,
I'd make it my business.

385
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,188
What are you eggs?

386
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:28,734
Soft-boiled, that you don't
stick up for a kidnapped girl?

387
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,463
- Who are you?
- Just passing through.

388
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:35,405
Been up to Capital City, strike-breaking
for the streetcar company.

389
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:38,704
Maybe you need some help here too.

390
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,245
Not from a mug like you.

391
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:43,577
Lay off, Garrett. The sheriff made
a monkey out of you too.

392
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:48,450
He's right. We ought to be ashamed
letting a stranger show us the ropes.

393
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:53,490
Come on, fellas, let's go get him.
Come on!

394
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,102
Come on, let's have some fun!

395
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:37,369
Where's that special deputy list
I made out?

396
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,702
Did I tell you to call up the gov...?
Wait a minute.

397
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:48,340
Here, Myrtle, first call up
the men I've checked on that list.

398
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:53,017
Get out the tear gas bombs.

399
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:55,348
- Two apiece.
- Right.

400
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:38,898
Sheriff, we wanna talk
to this Wilson guy.

401
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:46,104
Boys, keep out of this.

402
00:33:46,273 --> 00:33:50,676
There's no positive proof
that the man you want to...

403
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:53,746
...talk to is guilty.

404
00:33:54,849 --> 00:33:56,441
Or innocent either.

405
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,108
The district attorney
is checking on him now.

406
00:33:59,286 --> 00:34:01,413
But whichever he is...

407
00:34:01,589 --> 00:34:04,581
...he's under the protection
of the law.

408
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:14,932
As long as I stand here
you can yell yourselves hoarse.

409
00:34:15,102 --> 00:34:18,435
- But you won't see this man.
- Then you won't stand there long.

410
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,766
We'll move you.

411
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:24,444
Well, then I ought to tell you men...

412
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:26,944
...the National Guard is on its way.

413
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:33,485
Orders to stop,
telephoned from the governor.

414
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:36,714
- Stop? But...
- Why, Will?

415
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:40,759
Because people always resent
troops moving in on them.

416
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:43,226
Hurts their pride.

417
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:47,156
When the papers phoned me
about this little ruckus in Strand...

418
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,666
...I was able to calm them
down all right.

419
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:54,001
But knowing how conscientious
you are, Bert, I came right over.

420
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,167
And mighty good thing
I was in time to stop you too.

421
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,179
You could cut our political throats
with this soldier stuff in an election year.

422
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:08,753
You, Freddy Garrett, Durkin, Lopez,
Walker, Johnson, all of you, go home.

423
00:35:09,557 --> 00:35:12,355
You're gonna wind up being sorry
for this.

424
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:15,284
Think of your families.

425
00:35:15,796 --> 00:35:20,290
Stick in with this kidnapper, Milt Grimes,
and you'd better not come home tonight.

426
00:35:21,102 --> 00:35:23,866
You elected me to do my duty,
and I'm going to.

427
00:35:29,443 --> 00:35:33,470
You're diving in over your heads, men.
Listen to reason.

428
00:35:33,647 --> 00:35:36,707
Stop acting like a lot of hysterical...

429
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:42,448
I'm warning you!
Don't make me use force.

430
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,887
You're not up against just us here.

431
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:48,960
- More deputies, with tear gas and rifles...
- Hey!

432
00:35:55,836 --> 00:35:59,135
Hey, jailer! Jailer! Come here, will you?
Hey, jailer!

433
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,208
Jailer!

434
00:36:02,376 --> 00:36:05,038
Jailer! Have the sheriff inform
my girl, will you?

435
00:36:05,212 --> 00:36:07,043
She's the one I wanted to call up.

436
00:36:07,214 --> 00:36:10,183
I just didn't wanna get her
mixed up in this thing.

437
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,875
She can tell you who I am.

438
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,323
Ten cents.

439
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:32,871
Hey, buddy! Hey!

440
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,735
Hey, is this the way to Strand?

441
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,208
- Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks. Keep going.

442
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,884
Them newsreel guys are on their toes.
Must have found out before it happened.

443
00:36:47,087 --> 00:36:50,454
I phoned where I live.
There's no word of him.

444
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:55,755
Oh, he had a puncture, I suppose.
Everything will be all right.

445
00:36:56,764 --> 00:37:00,222
The things that happen.
The bus driver just told me...

446
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:04,235
...they got somebody they suspect
of that kidnapping at Strand.

447
00:37:05,406 --> 00:37:06,771
A fella named Joe Wilson.

448
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:09,273
The mob there is trying
to make him confess.

449
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:11,673
Joe Wilson? But...

450
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:14,306
Joe... That's impossible.

451
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:17,575
He never hurt a hair on anyone's head
in his life.

452
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:23,451
Where's a car? I've got to go there.
Lend me your car, please? I've got to go.

453
00:37:23,624 --> 00:37:25,956
- The boys got my car.
- When's the next bus?

454
00:37:26,126 --> 00:37:28,390
They ain't no more.

455
00:37:31,198 --> 00:37:35,897
What'll I do? I've got to go.

456
00:37:37,471 --> 00:37:40,634
Don't you understand?
I've got to go to him.

457
00:37:41,275 --> 00:37:43,140
Won't you help me?

458
00:37:51,785 --> 00:37:54,515
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
what a shot this is.

459
00:37:54,722 --> 00:37:56,917
We'll sweep the country
with this stuff.

460
00:37:57,091 --> 00:38:00,151
Oh, the film's gone. Reload.

461
00:38:00,327 --> 00:38:03,296
And be sure and use
that hypersensitive film.

462
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:05,091
Holy smoke.

463
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:09,362
Come on, Bill, make it snappy.
And get me that 2-inch lens.

464
00:38:12,806 --> 00:38:13,864
Bar the door.

465
00:38:16,443 --> 00:38:17,967
Open the door!

466
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:20,636
I can get them through the window.

467
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:22,475
- More bombs!
- We're almost out.

468
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,675
- Where's them National Guards?
- Where's Ralph?

469
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:26,183
- Here.
- Where's Milt?

470
00:38:26,353 --> 00:38:29,516
- His wife took him home.
- Why, the yellow...

471
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:33,525
Wait a minute.

472
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:37,396
What does that silence mean? Quiet.

473
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,995
<i>Heave ho!</i>

474
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:45,694
<i>Heave ho! Heave...</i>

475
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:48,966
Get cabinets, desks,
line them up against that door.

476
00:38:51,378 --> 00:38:53,903
Stop! Please, stop!

477
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:01,013
Jailer! Jailer! Can't anybody hear me?
Let me out!

478
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:03,149
I'll talk to them!

479
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:05,815
Let me out! Give me a chance!

480
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:09,895
Let me talk to them!
Give me a chance, will you?

481
00:39:10,564 --> 00:39:12,293
Can't anybody hear me?

482
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,257
- Up to the cells, men.
- Come on!

483
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:51,299
- Give us the keys, Lem.
- I ain't got them.

484
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:55,203
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.
- All we want is this guy Wilson.

485
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,468
- We know you got keys.
- I ain't got them!

486
00:39:57,711 --> 00:40:00,111
- We want those keys.
- Where are they?

487
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,554
- Get a post. We'll break it down!
- Yeah, that's it!

488
00:40:12,726 --> 00:40:15,559
We haven't got time.
Let's smoke him out.

489
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:19,290
Yeah, he's right. Let's go, men.
Come on, let's get some wood.

490
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,496
Hope you like baked potatoes, Wilson.

491
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,939
- Hey!
- There goes his dog!

492
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:33,773
- Give me some of them books.
- Hey, come back here!

493
00:40:33,947 --> 00:40:35,574
- Let the dog go!
- Get it down!

494
00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:39,014
Hey, Wilson, they can't parole you
out of this.

495
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:42,751
Hello, Rainbow.

496
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:45,925
Let him have it. Take it away.

497
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:38,869
Looks bad, Rainbow.

498
00:41:41,381 --> 00:41:42,609
Looks bad.

499
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,679
There he is!

500
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:05,670
I am the resurrection and the life,
saith the Lord.

501
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,434
I am a stranger with thee
and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.

502
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,637
God forgive him and our trespasses, as
we forgive them who trespass against us.

503
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:16,305
Run in back, Wilson. Get back there!

504
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:18,815
What are you looking for,
the Peabody girl?

505
00:42:18,986 --> 00:42:20,317
Get back!

506
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,460
No.

507
00:42:37,704 --> 00:42:39,797
Jiggers! The soldiers are coming!

508
00:42:39,973 --> 00:42:41,338
Soldiers!

509
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,311
- Let's beat it.
- Wait! I've got an idea.

510
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,977
- They'll never get him out.
- That's the stuff.

511
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,454
After this dynamite,
they won't be able to find the jail.

512
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,353
Wait! Here's somebody!

513
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:04,190
Help her up!

514
00:43:13,874 --> 00:43:16,707
Why, the very spirit of government
has been violated.

515
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:19,368
The state disgraced in the eyes
of the world...

516
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,674
...by this brutal outburst
of lust for vengeance.

517
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:24,282
And I blame myself.

518
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,247
I let you talk me down.

519
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,856
That mob could have been stopped
if assistance had been sent...

520
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:32,014
...to officers in time.
- Forget it.

521
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:36,595
The reformers will cuss around for a while
and then start cussing something else.

522
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:41,932
These letters and telegrams backing up
the statement I gave.

523
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:44,229
Congratulations, 90 percent of them.

524
00:43:44,404 --> 00:43:46,736
"Finest thing we've heard of in years."

525
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:48,306
"Congratulations."

526
00:43:48,508 --> 00:43:50,874
I wonder what sort of telegrams
we'll get...

527
00:43:51,044 --> 00:43:53,808
...when it's known that Wilson
was an innocent man.

528
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:57,575
Well, when I gave out the statement
I didn't know that.

529
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:04,880
This story is on every wire
in the world right now.

530
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:13,824
Yeah, yeah.
Now he's innocent. Yeah.

531
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,964
I can't get it out of my head.
I can't get any sleep.

532
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,540
When I close my eyes, I...

533
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,946
I can't understand why we haven't
heard from Katherine.

534
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,591
She's like all the rest.

535
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,126
He gets in trouble,
and she takes a run-out powder.

536
00:44:42,863 --> 00:44:46,458
When I think how happy he was
when he left here...

537
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,464
Oh, stop it!

538
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,015
Hey, what are you doing here?

539
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:09,982
You better go back.

540
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:20,497
- Any of that milk left, Tom?
- What?

541
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:22,565
Oh, yes.

542
00:45:22,736 --> 00:45:24,897
There. Come back over here.

543
00:45:25,972 --> 00:45:27,530
Here.

544
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:38,377
If I could only get at them rats.
If I could only get my hands on them.

545
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:41,419
We're going out there, Tom.
We're gonna get them.

546
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:45,523
- Kill them the way they killed Joe.
- Whatever you say. And whenever.

547
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:48,559
That's five-and-ten-cent store talk.

548
00:45:50,864 --> 00:45:52,661
Joe!

549
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,233
Joe.

550
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:04,707
Pull down that shade.

551
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:07,440
Pull down the shade!

552
00:46:20,293 --> 00:46:21,954
Turn out that light!

553
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:39,576
You know where I've been all day?

554
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:42,078
In a movie.

555
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:47,981
Watching a newsreel of myself
getting burned alive.

556
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,418
I watched it 10 times or 20 maybe.

557
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:54,685
Over and over again.
I don't know how much.

558
00:46:54,995 --> 00:46:57,657
The place was packed. They like it.

559
00:46:57,831 --> 00:47:02,791
They get a big kick out of seeing a man
burned to death. A big kick!

560
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:07,201
What an explosion.

561
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:12,608
It blew the cell door off,
and it killed...

562
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,804
...Rainbow.

563
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:19,945
I got out down a rain-pipe.

564
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,321
I almost burned my side off.

565
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,516
I could smell myself burn!

566
00:47:26,726 --> 00:47:31,163
- It's awful. I feel like thanking God.
- Did you get burned bad?

567
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:34,528
That don't hurt me.
You can't hurt a dead man and I'm dead.

568
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:37,862
Everybody knows that.
The whole country. I'm dead, see.

569
00:47:38,038 --> 00:47:40,529
You remember me preaching to you
to live right?

570
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,335
Live right. I tried it. I tried to like it.

571
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,604
And people... But they won't let you!

572
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,682
You were right. Donelli was right.
Everyone was right but me. I was wrong.

573
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,284
I know now. I'll get them.

574
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:56,354
- We'll get a lawyer and have them...
- Arrested for disturbing the peace?

575
00:47:56,523 --> 00:48:00,015
For setting fire to a jail, maybe?
No, that's not enough for me.

576
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,559
I'm burned to death
by a mob of animals.

577
00:48:02,762 --> 00:48:05,128
I'm legally dead.
They're legally murderers.

578
00:48:05,298 --> 00:48:07,129
That I'm alive is not their fault.

579
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,734
But I know them.
I know a lot of them.

580
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:11,302
And they'll hang for it.

581
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:14,463
According to the law which says
if you kill somebody...

582
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,404
...you gotta be killed yourself.

583
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:19,204
I'll give them the chance
they didn't give me.

584
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:22,576
They'll get a legal trial
in a legal courtroom.

585
00:48:22,782 --> 00:48:25,580
They'll have a legal judge
and a legal defense.

586
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:29,721
They'll get a legal sentence
and a legal death.

587
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,092
But I can't do it myself.

588
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,364
You'll have to do it for me.

589
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:47,366
You see that?

590
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:49,831
I tore it out of a law book.

591
00:48:54,047 --> 00:48:58,780
My husband says it would be a blessing
if the community would forget...

592
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,579
...what happened.

593
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:04,520
It just leaves a bad taste,
and it reminds everyone of what...

594
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:11,630
...as the minister said Sunday,
would be better forgiven and forgotten.

595
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,828
The mailman was just here.

596
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:19,935
Shall I go?

597
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:23,732
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

598
00:49:27,347 --> 00:49:30,111
Oh, it's you, Mrs. Garrett.
Come in.

599
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,645
Have you heard anything
from the hotel?

600
00:49:32,852 --> 00:49:36,049
Fred's been down at that investigation
for so long.

601
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:40,420
I wondered if your husband had phoned,
or anything.

602
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:44,327
There, there. Don't worry,
Mrs. Garrett, don't worry.

603
00:49:44,497 --> 00:49:49,230
Nobody's going to cut off their nose to
spite their face, naming names in this...

604
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:52,394
I know, but if somebody does talk,
then what'll happen?

605
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,767
Nobody's going to talk.

606
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:59,100
The responsible businessmen
have decided it's a community...

607
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:01,076
...and not an individual thing.

608
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:05,616
So everybody's got to stick together
against this district attorney.

609
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:08,947
The whole town's tongue-tied.
Under wraps.

610
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:11,613
- Protecting its own, naturally.
- Ask anybody!

611
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,656
They'll tell you Joe was there.

612
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:16,091
Before I can charge anybody
with murder...

613
00:50:16,262 --> 00:50:18,492
...I have to prove a murder
was committed.

614
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:21,532
And I can't even find anyone who will
swear...

615
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:26,297
...that at the time the jail burned,
your brother was in it at all.

616
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:31,208
Sorry, boys, but I've got to go
back tonight.

617
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,709
Come on, I don't believe she ran out
on him.

618
00:50:33,913 --> 00:50:38,350
We got an hour till train time, so we
might as well try. We can ask, anyway.

619
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:43,052
I'll do the talking.

620
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:47,657
Miss Grant live here?

621
00:50:47,827 --> 00:50:50,057
She's very sick.
She can't talk to anyone.

622
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:54,496
- Our name's Wilson. We're...
- Oh, his brothers. Come in, come in.

623
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,808
Hello, Katherine.

624
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,084
Katherine!

625
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:17,656
- It's Charlie.
- And Tom.

626
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,359
This is the way she's been ever since
she came home.

627
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:25,327
Katherine, don't you remember us?

628
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:27,363
We came from Joe...

629
00:51:28,368 --> 00:51:31,599
We're Joe's brothers.
Joe, Katherine.

630
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:35,036
You see? It's the same as ev...

631
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:38,735
Land sakes! Excuse me a second.
I've got broth on the stove.

632
00:51:41,915 --> 00:51:44,941
Charlie, look. She is sick.

633
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:47,450
- If we tell her Joe's all right...
- Shut up!

634
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:51,283
She can't hear. But it's not fair
to her not to know. It might help.

635
00:51:51,491 --> 00:51:55,052
No, no. Let me think.

636
00:52:05,105 --> 00:52:07,733
No. No! No!

637
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,934
Joe! Joe!

638
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:16,276
No, it's Charlie.
Charlie, Katherine, and Tom.

639
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:17,973
What is...?

640
00:52:18,151 --> 00:52:23,453
Joe's brothers. Try and remember,
Katherine. Joe's brothers.

641
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,050
Charlie?

642
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:34,795
Tom?

643
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,929
Oh, Charlie...

644
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:41,937
...I saw him.

645
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,271
I saw him...

646
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,244
...behind those flames...

647
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:51,439
...in that burning jail.

648
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,250
His face.

649
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:57,583
There, dear heart, it's all over now.

650
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,553
The witness.

651
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,088
I'll make them suffer.
I'll get them now, all right.

652
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:10,134
Why'd you have to come to Capital City?
Why didn't you stay in Chicago?

653
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:13,602
Your picture will be in the papers.
Somebody will see you.

654
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:17,504
Nobody will see me because I'll be
hiding. I had to be on the scene.

655
00:53:17,677 --> 00:53:20,805
Did you think I was going to wait
for letters from you?

656
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:25,508
I think Joe's right. It's natural, wanting
to hear everything as soon as possible.

657
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:28,552
- Maybe he'll wanna see Katherine.
- Get this straight!

658
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:32,714
Katherine's not to know I'm alive.
She'd crack. Never go through with it.

659
00:53:32,892 --> 00:53:35,224
She wouldn't see things
the way I see them.

660
00:53:37,197 --> 00:53:39,722
I wanna hear everything they say.

661
00:53:39,899 --> 00:53:42,527
I wanna see them squirm
the way they made me.

662
00:53:42,702 --> 00:53:44,670
I wanna see them
at the end of a rope.

663
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:48,368
Adams, I've got to hold this party
together in this state.

664
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:53,035
These star-spangled heroics of yours
will blow it a mile high.

665
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:58,014
I've got to proceed with this case
as my oath of office requires.

666
00:53:58,918 --> 00:54:02,752
You and your wife
and that boy of yours...

667
00:54:02,922 --> 00:54:05,686
Adams, you like to eat, don't you?

668
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:07,883
Sure, Will.

669
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:11,656
But some of the things people have had
to eat in this country lately...

670
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,322
...haven't agreed with their stomachs.
- But...

671
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,331
Well, who are you going to name?

672
00:54:16,502 --> 00:54:19,027
You can't bring a town
full of John Does to trial...

673
00:54:19,205 --> 00:54:22,174
...just to pull yourself
to heaven on a publicity stunt.

674
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:28,339
John Doe is not going to trial, Will...

675
00:54:28,514 --> 00:54:32,006
...but 22 citizens of Strand...

676
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:37,418
...who I can prove are guilty of murder
in the first degree.

677
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,218
Because the law declares
that in a lynching...

678
00:54:40,393 --> 00:54:44,261
...all who consent to the design
are responsible for what took place.

679
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,866
All who participate
are responsible for the act.

680
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,058
This may seem harsh...

681
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:53,364
...but when a mob takes it upon itself...

682
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:58,169
...to identify, try, condemn and punish...

683
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:04,581
...it is a destroyer of a government that
patriots died to establish and defend.

684
00:55:04,751 --> 00:55:08,482
Every decent person in the country
feels the importance of this case.

685
00:55:08,721 --> 00:55:11,588
The nation is hanging on the outcome
of this trial.

686
00:55:11,758 --> 00:55:15,592
<i>No lynching can be justified,</i>
<i>though sometimes attempts are made...</i>

687
00:55:15,762 --> 00:55:19,391
<i>... to whitewash them by citing</i>
<i>the confessions of...</i>

688
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,161
<i>... or proofs of guilt against,</i>
<i>the by now silent corpse.</i>

689
00:55:24,337 --> 00:55:29,400
<i>But no one can dare defend the lynching</i>
<i>of an innocent man.</i>

690
00:55:29,575 --> 00:55:34,638
<i>American democracy and its system</i>
<i>of fair play for the rights of individuals...</i>

691
00:55:34,814 --> 00:55:38,477
...under the law is on trial here,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

692
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:44,089
To this end, you must be guided
not only by your common sense...

693
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,781
...but by your patriotism.

694
00:55:56,536 --> 00:55:59,471
As counsel for these defendants,
Your Honor...

695
00:55:59,672 --> 00:56:02,300
...ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

696
00:56:02,475 --> 00:56:06,878
...I must point out that my clients
are not on trial for treason...

697
00:56:07,046 --> 00:56:09,480
...against any philosophy
of government...

698
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:12,776
...as our esteemed district attorney
seems to think.

699
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:14,816
They're on trial for murder.

700
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:18,218
A charge you will see vanish
into thin air here...

701
00:56:18,391 --> 00:56:21,792
...as the state, to cover up its own
criminal negligence...

702
00:56:21,994 --> 00:56:26,260
...in not protecting this innocent man,
proceeds in this savage attempt...

703
00:56:26,432 --> 00:56:28,957
...to kill as scapegoats...

704
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,502
...these 22 bewildered souls.

705
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:40,072
These defendants have pleaded
not guilty to the charge of murder.

706
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:43,205
We're ready, Your Honor.

707
00:56:45,418 --> 00:56:48,251
Are you ready, Mr. Adams?

708
00:56:49,522 --> 00:56:53,288
With the permission of the court
and of my friends for the defense...

709
00:56:53,459 --> 00:56:59,022
...and their experienced associate
brought from the city of New York...

710
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:01,826
...l'll reverse the usual order
of procedure...

711
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:04,663
...and instead of establishing
the crime itself...

712
00:57:04,837 --> 00:57:07,806
...first establish the whereabouts
of the accused...

713
00:57:07,974 --> 00:57:09,839
...during the commission thereof.

714
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:14,173
As its first witness,
the state calls Edna Hooper.

715
00:57:16,282 --> 00:57:19,342
Raise your right hand
and place your left on the Bible.

716
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,182
Do you swear you'll tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

717
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:26,052
- I do.
- Be seated, please.

718
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,520
- Your name?
- Miss Edna Hooper.

719
00:57:30,696 --> 00:57:35,133
- Your residence, Miss Hooper?
- Twenty-three Catalpa Avenue, Strand.

720
00:57:35,301 --> 00:57:38,236
Strand is the town in which
this lynching took place?

721
00:57:38,404 --> 00:57:40,668
Objection! Object as
to his incompetence.

722
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,708
- Question assumes a fact not in evidence.
- Sustained. Strike it out.

723
00:57:44,877 --> 00:57:47,072
I will reframe the question.

724
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,741
Strand is where the jail burned down
on the night of October 26th, is it not?

725
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:55,581
Yes, but I certainly had nothing
to do with the...

726
00:57:55,788 --> 00:58:00,054
You're not on trial, Miss Hooper.
Your occupation in Strand, please?

727
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:03,161
I am a couturier and a modiste.

728
00:58:03,329 --> 00:58:07,823
By couturier and modiste, you mean
you're a dressmaker, do you not?

729
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,334
It's just the difference between a
dress shop and a gown shoppe.

730
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,741
On the afternoon and evening
of the day in question...

731
00:58:16,909 --> 00:58:20,504
...you were employed in your capacity
as a couturier...

732
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,275
...in the home of Frederick Garrett
in Strand, were you not?

733
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,942
- I was.
- Who was in the house beside yourself?

734
00:58:28,187 --> 00:58:30,747
The baby and Mr. And Mrs. Garrett.

735
00:58:30,923 --> 00:58:32,891
And this Mr. Garrett...

736
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,790
...is the same Frederick Garrett
who is one of these defendants here?

737
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:38,692
Yes.

738
00:58:38,865 --> 00:58:42,266
Will Frederick Garrett stand, please?

739
00:58:45,404 --> 00:58:49,932
This man, charged with murder,
is the Frederick Garrett who...

740
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:54,471
...by the testimony of your eyesight,
Miss Hooper...

741
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:58,845
...was at home that Saturday afternoon
and evening, then?

742
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,784
Yes.

743
00:59:02,154 --> 00:59:06,818
I will remind the witness
that she is under oath...

744
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,324
...and ask her again.

745
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:13,989
Edna Hooper, will you swear that during
the hours when this indictment...

746
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:17,226
...charges that this defendant,
Frederick Garrett...

747
00:59:17,403 --> 00:59:20,770
...among others,
murdered Joseph Wilson...

748
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:26,640
...will you swear that during those hours
Garrett was peaceably in his own house?

749
00:59:30,249 --> 00:59:32,274
Yes.

750
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:34,783
That's all. Thank you.

751
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:37,484
You can go.

752
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:41,985
Oh, Miss Hooper, isn't it true
that for years...

753
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,154
...you've been a close friend of, and,
before she married, roomed with...

754
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,527
...Mrs. Garrett?
- Don't answer that!

755
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:53,001
But this is a witness for the state,
sir, not for the defense.

756
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:57,632
- I'm sorry, I simply meant to object.
- I withdraw the question.

757
01:00:02,281 --> 01:00:03,805
Miss Franchette...

758
01:00:03,983 --> 01:00:07,350
...you are then the proprietor
as well as the hostess...

759
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,988
...of the Green Light Inn?

760
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:13,489
Well, it's my place,
if that's what you mean.

761
01:00:13,659 --> 01:00:18,028
That's just what I mean.
The list, please.

762
01:00:19,165 --> 01:00:22,134
Will the defendants
whose names I read stand?

763
01:00:22,301 --> 01:00:28,206
Dawson, Piper, Lopez, and Durkin.

764
01:00:29,308 --> 01:00:33,074
Miss Franchette,
do you recognize these men?

765
01:00:33,245 --> 01:00:35,042
I most certainly do.

766
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,514
Did you see them at any time
between 5 and 9 p. M...

767
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:44,918
...on October 26th in Strand?
And, if so, where?

768
01:00:45,091 --> 01:00:48,254
Well, they were all at my place.
In the caf.

769
01:00:48,494 --> 01:00:53,261
From 6 till, oh, 10, 11, anyhow.

770
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:58,733
And what makes the presence of these
particular men stick in your mind?

771
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:03,204
Because, for once, Mr. Dawson
paid the bill.

772
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:09,006
You mean, by Mr. Dawson,
the defendant Kirby Dawson.

773
01:01:09,181 --> 01:01:10,842
Oh, yes.

774
01:01:11,017 --> 01:01:15,454
Two years in jail, not identified
with any church.

775
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:20,354
- Objection!
- Sorry. I was just thinking out loud.

776
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,084
Yeah.

777
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:25,458
This defendant, Kirby Dawson,
according to these notes...

778
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,600
...also known as Bubbles...

779
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,737
...for once paid the bill.

780
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:36,305
But he or someone else didn't pay you to
concoct an alibi for him and his friends...

781
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:38,773
...by any chance, did they?
- Objection!

782
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:41,707
Sustained. Strike it out.

783
01:01:42,148 --> 01:01:46,414
I wonder if I haven't been calling
the defense witnesses by mistake.

784
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,110
His last remark proves
the district attorney...

785
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,950
...hasn't lost his humor,
in spite of the fact...

786
01:01:52,124 --> 01:01:55,719
...that his attempt to establish
the presence of the defendants...

787
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:59,729
...at the lynching has either failed
or been ridiculed by the defense.

788
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:01,491
Wait. Just wait.

789
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,569
<i>Thaddus Hummel, Sheriff of Strand</i>
<i>County, is now on the stand.</i>

790
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,069
Can you identify any or all
of these defendants...

791
01:02:09,241 --> 01:02:12,904
...as having been in the mob
that stormed your jail and burned it...

792
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:15,604
...thereby burning your prisoner
to death?

793
01:02:15,781 --> 01:02:17,339
Objection!

794
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:21,782
To the latter part of the question as
assuming a fact not yet proved.

795
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:25,014
I will change the question to:

796
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:28,627
"Who stormed your jail
and burned it," then.

797
01:02:36,202 --> 01:02:37,669
No, sir.

798
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,634
I can't identify them.

799
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:45,167
Can you, then, tell me the names of
anyone, other then these defendants...

800
01:02:45,344 --> 01:02:48,677
...among those rioters?
- No, sir.

801
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,215
They must have been men
from out of town.

802
01:02:52,384 --> 01:02:56,013
Oh, I see. Foreigners.

803
01:02:56,989 --> 01:03:01,323
I will remind the jury of the easy habit
of putting on foreigners...

804
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:04,691
...events that disturb our conscience.

805
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:09,892
Or perhaps it was a roving band
of redskins. Indians, I mean.

806
01:03:10,102 --> 01:03:12,570
Only red-skinned thing I saw
was that tomato...

807
01:03:12,738 --> 01:03:15,605
...that plopped me in the face
and made a fool of me.

808
01:03:17,743 --> 01:03:21,975
I must remind the spectators
of the dignity of this court.

809
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:28,112
An injury you suffered put you to bed
for a week, sheriff.

810
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:30,152
How did that happen?

811
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:33,086
The deputies that stuck with me...

812
01:03:33,492 --> 01:03:35,323
...most of them disappeared...

813
01:03:35,494 --> 01:03:38,156
...and I were holding off the mob
as best we could...

814
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:40,321
...with tear gas and rifle butts...

815
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:43,127
...when somebody slugged me
from behind, and l...

816
01:03:43,302 --> 01:03:48,296
You said, "slugged," "tear gas,"
"rifle butts," "mob."

817
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,999
After all, this was an attempted
lynching then!

818
01:03:51,177 --> 01:03:53,543
- Objection!
- The question was proper!

819
01:03:53,712 --> 01:03:56,943
I disagree! Your constant use
of the word lynching...

820
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:59,448
If counsel's ears were as quick
as his objections...

821
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,677
...he'd know I said
attempted lynching.

822
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,288
If the state's evidence was
as breathtaking as its sarcasm...

823
01:04:05,457 --> 01:04:09,120
...which I suggest is being employed
to hide from the jury...

824
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:12,787
...the failure of its own witnesses
to back up its hollow case...

825
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:15,866
Hooray! Hollow as a busted jug,
is what it is!

826
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,696
Quiet, will you?

827
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:19,628
Remove that man.

828
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:23,000
- I was just...
- Come here. You're going.

829
01:04:24,076 --> 01:04:28,342
They hadn't ought to treat Uncle Billy
that way! Uncle Billy's right!

830
01:04:28,514 --> 01:04:31,574
This is a shame against the good name
of our town.

831
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:36,745
- Bring that man before the court.
- Order in the court. Quiet.

832
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:39,356
He won't do nothing to me.
I ain't afraid.

833
01:04:39,525 --> 01:04:41,049
Sit down, you. Sit down!

834
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,191
I order you held in contempt
with a fine of $ 100...

835
01:04:45,364 --> 01:04:47,229
...or 10 days in the county jail.

836
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:49,526
I protest against this injustice!

837
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:52,694
The fine will be $200 or 30 days.

838
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:59,074
But he can't put me in...
Why, all I said was...

839
01:04:59,245 --> 01:05:01,509
A trial for murder...

840
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,013
...is the most solemn occasion
upon which men can be called...

841
01:05:05,184 --> 01:05:07,448
...to perform a public duty.

842
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:12,489
Any further demonstration
and I shall order the courtroom cleared.

843
01:05:13,726 --> 01:05:15,557
- Proceed.
- May it please the court.

844
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:18,693
The state's own witnesses...

845
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:22,425
...have not been able to identify
these defendants...

846
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:25,468
...as having even been
at the scene of the crime...

847
01:05:25,638 --> 01:05:27,469
...alleged in the indictment.

848
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,076
We must insist that the state
give us facts...

849
01:05:31,243 --> 01:05:33,143
...instead of...

850
01:05:33,312 --> 01:05:35,371
...tittle-tattle here.

851
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:37,242
Your Honor...

852
01:05:37,416 --> 01:05:40,214
...in the last 49 years...

853
01:05:40,386 --> 01:05:46,052
...mobs have lynched
6010 human beings...

854
01:05:46,225 --> 01:05:51,788
...by hanging, burning, cutting,
in this proud land of ours.

855
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:56,025
A lynching about every three days.

856
01:05:56,602 --> 01:06:00,060
And of the many thousands
that comprise these mobs...

857
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,302
...only 765 were ever
even brought to trial...

858
01:06:05,477 --> 01:06:08,969
...because their supposedly
civilized communities...

859
01:06:09,148 --> 01:06:12,083
...have refused to identify them
for trial.

860
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:16,654
Thus becoming as responsible,
before God at any rate...

861
01:06:16,822 --> 01:06:19,620
...as the lynchers themselves.

862
01:06:20,926 --> 01:06:24,657
I did not put these representative
citizens of Strand on the stand...

863
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:29,096
...to prove anything, Your Honor,
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

864
01:06:29,268 --> 01:06:32,999
...except that on their oaths...

865
01:06:33,172 --> 01:06:38,974
...to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth, so help them God...

866
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:42,480
...they are liars!

867
01:06:44,883 --> 01:06:48,819
And that their contempt of truth
shall not go unpunished...

868
01:06:48,988 --> 01:06:51,821
...I shall ask
their indictment for perjury...

869
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:55,392
...on the same evidence that
in one minute...

870
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:58,825
...will prove the identity
of these defendants...

871
01:06:59,031 --> 01:07:02,398
<i>... with that of 22 active members</i>
<i>of the mob...</i>

872
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:07,402
<i>... that stormed and burned the jail</i>
<i>and lynched Joseph Wilson!</i>

873
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,904
<i>I shall introduce that evidence now.</i>

874
01:07:10,142 --> 01:07:13,373
Will counsel for the defense
please approach the bench?

875
01:07:16,415 --> 01:07:20,249
While the judge is hearing arguments
over the admission of evidence...

876
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:24,753
...l'll take this opportunity to remind you
this broadcast is brought to you...

877
01:07:24,923 --> 01:07:29,155
...courtesy of No Make-A Me Fat,
that magic dessert...

878
01:07:29,328 --> 01:07:31,819
Flash! Against the objection
of the defense...

879
01:07:31,997 --> 01:07:35,398
...the judge has just admitted
this evidence, whatever it is!

880
01:07:40,272 --> 01:07:43,002
Stand back, everybody.
Clear the door.

881
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:48,709
I warn the spectators
against any demonstrations.

882
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:54,875
At the slightest sign of disorder,
I will unhesitatingly clear this court.

883
01:07:55,054 --> 01:07:58,080
- We are ready, Your Honor.
- Proceed.

884
01:07:59,758 --> 01:08:03,694
By stipulation with defense attorneys
that this is a true film record...

885
01:08:03,862 --> 01:08:09,425
...taken at Strand by Ted Fitzgerald,
in employment as a news cameraman...

886
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:14,595
...I hereby present this film
as state's Exhibit A.

887
01:08:14,773 --> 01:08:16,707
Close the shutters.

888
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:18,467
- Ready?
- Ready.

889
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,304
- Ready?
- Let it run.

890
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:28,042
Defendant number one,
Kirby Dawson...

891
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,621
...who, according to testimony,
was in the Green Light Inn...

892
01:08:31,790 --> 01:08:34,884
...during the hours of the commission
of this crime.

893
01:08:38,797 --> 01:08:40,458
A stop action of the scene.

894
01:08:40,632 --> 01:08:43,567
Defendant number two,
Mrs. Sally Humphries...

895
01:08:43,735 --> 01:08:45,703
...who, according to testimony...

896
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:50,304
...during the hours of this crime
was on the farm of her fianc.

897
01:08:50,476 --> 01:08:54,105
We identify her by stop action
of the same shot.

898
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,449
The first brand that transformed
that jail into a blazing stake...

899
01:08:59,618 --> 01:09:01,518
...for Joseph Wilson.

900
01:09:02,488 --> 01:09:06,151
The fire department courageously tried
to extinguish those flames...

901
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:08,987
...but overwhelming numbers
fought them back.

902
01:09:09,161 --> 01:09:12,858
While in the meantime,
the defendant Frederick Garrett...

903
01:09:13,098 --> 01:09:17,262
...peaceably armed with an ax,
destroyed the efforts of the officials...

904
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:21,099
...to save the life of an innocent man.
The enlarged stop action...

905
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:26,877
No, no! It's not true. He...

906
01:09:28,013 --> 01:09:32,677
Order in the court! Order!
Order in the court!

907
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:53,394
- Come on. We're gonna be late.
- Couldn't get a car. There's a crowd.

908
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:56,040
That's all. That's all.

909
01:09:57,509 --> 01:10:00,171
- Do you feel better today?
- Don't worry.

910
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:04,171
- Second floor. Traffic Court.
- Pardon me.

911
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:14,490
- Got a cigarette, Tom?
- Sure.

912
01:10:18,096 --> 01:10:19,859
Peanuts.

913
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:23,728
Judge Hopkins' Court.

914
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:25,836
Come on. We're getting out too.

915
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:31,673
The last the sheriff, the jailer, or anyone
else saw of him was before the fire.

916
01:10:31,843 --> 01:10:34,311
I must insist on my question.

917
01:10:34,513 --> 01:10:39,041
Who proved that Joseph Wilson was in
that jail at the time it burned?

918
01:10:39,218 --> 01:10:42,187
- The jailer threw the keys down.
- Are you ready?

919
01:10:42,354 --> 01:10:47,758
Isn't there the possibility the prisoner
angled for those keys and escaped?

920
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:50,554
- Are you ready?
- We say that possibility exists.

921
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:54,027
It's up to the state to prove it false.

922
01:10:54,266 --> 01:10:57,030
Is the state prepared to proceed?

923
01:10:57,202 --> 01:11:00,831
We call Katherine Grant to the stand.

924
01:11:01,373 --> 01:11:04,934
<i>Do you swear to tell the truth</i>
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

925
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,374
<i>- I do.</i>
<i>- Be seated, please.</i>

926
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:11,482
<i>State your name, residence</i>
<i>and occupation, please.</i>

927
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:12,981
<i>Katherine Grant.</i>

928
01:11:13,218 --> 01:11:15,982
I'm a teacher in the
Washington Public School here.

929
01:11:16,154 --> 01:11:18,088
I live at 96 Oak Street.

930
01:11:18,257 --> 01:11:21,055
With your parents, Miss Grant?

931
01:11:21,226 --> 01:11:23,126
My father and mother are dead.

932
01:11:23,295 --> 01:11:28,164
Your relationship to Joseph Wilson was?

933
01:11:29,768 --> 01:11:31,963
We were going to be married.

934
01:11:32,137 --> 01:11:35,629
Will you tell the jury, in your own way...

935
01:11:35,807 --> 01:11:39,573
...what happened on October 26th.

936
01:11:40,312 --> 01:11:44,339
I fixed a little lunch of things
I thought he'd like.

937
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:47,144
With flowers on the table...

938
01:11:47,319 --> 01:11:49,787
...and some salted...

939
01:11:51,156 --> 01:11:54,683
...peanuts. He always liked peanuts.

940
01:11:54,893 --> 01:11:57,453
Are you able to go on, Miss Grant?

941
01:11:58,163 --> 01:12:00,893
Certainly I can go on.

942
01:12:01,133 --> 01:12:03,829
I went to meet him at Sycamore Corners.

943
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:07,961
On the way, I bought him
some neckties for a present.

944
01:12:09,441 --> 01:12:11,671
He liked blue.

945
01:12:13,345 --> 01:12:17,805
He never thought of buying
things like that for himself.

946
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:22,681
And then I stopped at
the minister's to remind him...

947
01:12:22,854 --> 01:12:26,950
<i>... that Joe and I would be there</i>
<i>at 4:00, and not to forget.</i>

948
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:31,155
<i>We'd been away from</i>
<i>each other so long.</i>

949
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,560
<i>More than a year.</i>

950
01:12:34,232 --> 01:12:38,191
<i>And l... I loved him so.</i>

951
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:12,103
<i>I turn the witness over to the defense.</i>

952
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:15,531
<i>Miss Grant. According to</i>
<i>the fact of psychology...</i>

953
01:13:15,707 --> 01:13:20,041
...that under great emotional stress
the mind sees what it has expected to...

954
01:13:20,212 --> 01:13:22,772
...whether the thing
is actually there or not...

955
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:27,042
...is it not possible that you
did not see Joseph Wilson...

956
01:13:27,219 --> 01:13:31,121
...but only the image of him your
imagination had created in your head?

957
01:13:31,289 --> 01:13:34,884
No, I saw him. I saw him
burning to death there!

958
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:38,689
You can see that picture now
too, can't you?

959
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:41,298
- I'll always see it.
- So perhaps after all...

960
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,800
...it was an hallucination of your tortured
mind that you saw there...

961
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,199
...just as you see it here.

962
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:52,070
What do you want me to say,
yes or no? I tell you I saw him.

963
01:13:52,244 --> 01:13:56,738
Can you, from your
own personal knowledge...

964
01:13:56,915 --> 01:13:59,713
...swear that Joseph Wilson is dead?

965
01:13:59,885 --> 01:14:02,445
Why, no. That is, yes.

966
01:14:02,621 --> 01:14:05,249
- I mean, one can assume.
- Excuse me...

967
01:14:05,424 --> 01:14:09,451
...but that is exactly what must not
be assumed, but proved!

968
01:14:09,628 --> 01:14:13,462
The state is asking the lives
of 22 people for one.

969
01:14:13,632 --> 01:14:15,964
I don't care about the lives of 22 people!

970
01:14:16,134 --> 01:14:18,568
They can't bring back
the life I cared about.

971
01:14:18,737 --> 01:14:23,970
I only wish I hadn't fainted. I wish I could
have gone in there to him. With him.

972
01:14:24,443 --> 01:14:26,673
That's all, Miss Grant.

973
01:14:33,985 --> 01:14:37,250
I will remind the jury
that under the law...

974
01:14:37,422 --> 01:14:41,791
...lives must not be taken on
assumptions but on facts!

975
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:44,520
Where is the corpse of Joseph Wilson?

976
01:14:44,696 --> 01:14:48,029
<i>The law is that the corpus</i>
<i>delicti must be established...</i>

977
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,327
<i>... at least by fragments</i>
<i>of the human body...</i>

978
01:14:50,502 --> 01:14:54,939
<i>... or of articles known and proved</i>
<i>to have been worn by the deceased.</i>

979
01:14:55,273 --> 01:14:58,936
And in the absence of convincing proof
of the corpus delicti...

980
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:01,943
...I move this indictment
be wiped off the records...

981
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:05,639
...and the charges against
these defendants be dismissed.

982
01:15:05,817 --> 01:15:09,844
I shall take the motion for dismissal
under advisement until tomorrow...

983
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:13,017
<i>... and hear the state's arguments then.</i>

984
01:15:27,339 --> 01:15:30,069
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

985
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:32,176
...I have received an object...

986
01:15:32,344 --> 01:15:34,209
...which, if authentic...

987
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:37,246
...must be considered
as evidence in this case.

988
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:42,519
As to its authenticity, I am not
permitted to have an opinion.

989
01:15:42,687 --> 01:15:46,748
However, in order to present it to you...

990
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:49,689
...I must take the witness stand.

991
01:15:50,862 --> 01:15:52,420
Mr. Clerk...

992
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:54,360
...please swear me.

993
01:15:59,404 --> 01:16:03,067
Do you swear that you'll tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

994
01:16:03,241 --> 01:16:05,436
- I do.
- Please be seated.

995
01:16:07,846 --> 01:16:10,610
This is a special delivery
letter postmarked...

996
01:16:10,782 --> 01:16:14,047
...in this city at 11 p.m. Last night...

997
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:19,350
...and addressed "Judge Daniel Hopkins,
Hall of Justice, Courtroom 10."

998
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:22,921
Is this the letter you received,
Your Honor?

999
01:16:28,266 --> 01:16:29,893
It is.

1000
01:16:31,436 --> 01:16:34,030
The communication is not handwritten.

1001
01:16:34,205 --> 01:16:37,368
It is formed by letters cut
from a newspaper...

1002
01:16:37,542 --> 01:16:40,272
...and pasted together to spell words.

1003
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:44,245
It is, ladies and gentlemen, the
confession of a tortured conscience.

1004
01:16:44,416 --> 01:16:45,747
Listen.

1005
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,078
"I can't hide the truth any longer.

1006
01:16:48,253 --> 01:16:52,314
I am a citizen of Strand
who helped clean up the jail mess.

1007
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:56,085
In the ashes,
I found this enclosed ring.

1008
01:16:56,261 --> 01:17:01,597
Nobody knew it, so I was keeping it for
a mement... Memento.

1009
01:17:01,766 --> 01:17:03,996
But it is upsetting my conscience.

1010
01:17:04,202 --> 01:17:08,434
I don't dare sign this, or I would
probably get lynched myself.

1011
01:17:08,607 --> 01:17:11,337
A citizen of Strand."

1012
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,744
I now draw your attention to this ring.

1013
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:22,080
It's gold, melted and misshapen,
as if by fire.

1014
01:17:22,287 --> 01:17:26,951
Inside the ring is an engraved
inscription, reading...

1015
01:17:27,158 --> 01:17:29,353
I can decipher only the words...

1016
01:17:29,527 --> 01:17:32,519
..."Henry to K."

1017
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:34,323
The rest is melted out.

1018
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,231
But after that word, I can plainly read...

1019
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:40,768
...in a different style of engraving...

1020
01:17:40,939 --> 01:17:43,305
..."To Joe," obviously meaning...

1021
01:17:43,475 --> 01:17:45,534
- Objection!
- Sustained.

1022
01:17:45,744 --> 01:17:49,009
Since when have anonymous letters
become gospel in law?

1023
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,479
Who can say that ring was
the property of Joseph Wilson?

1024
01:17:52,651 --> 01:17:54,846
What proof is there that it was found...

1025
01:17:55,020 --> 01:17:58,285
...as that concocted letter
would have us believe?

1026
01:17:58,456 --> 01:18:01,823
Who sent that letter?
A man afraid to sign his name.

1027
01:18:02,327 --> 01:18:05,558
I believe that this fraud is
a fabrication of some soul...

1028
01:18:07,265 --> 01:18:10,257
...poisoned with hostility
toward these defendants!

1029
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:14,504
The state recalls
Katherine Grant to the stand.

1030
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:29,544
I will remind you, Miss Grant,
you've already sworn to tell the truth.

1031
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:34,052
Have you ever seen this ring before?

1032
01:18:36,094 --> 01:18:39,325
- Yes.
- Where and when?

1033
01:18:39,998 --> 01:18:42,694
In the railroad station in Chicago.

1034
01:18:42,867 --> 01:18:45,062
When I was leaving to come here.

1035
01:18:45,236 --> 01:18:46,999
I gave it to Joe.

1036
01:18:47,172 --> 01:18:50,699
What did Joseph Wilson do with it
when you gave it to him?

1037
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:54,110
He put it on his little finger.

1038
01:18:54,312 --> 01:18:57,008
It was too small for any other finger.

1039
01:18:57,182 --> 01:19:00,379
How can you be sure this ring
is the one you gave him...

1040
01:19:00,552 --> 01:19:03,749
...and saw him put
on his little finger there?

1041
01:19:06,324 --> 01:19:08,622
Because it was my mother's.

1042
01:19:09,227 --> 01:19:14,096
It had engraved "Henry,"
my father's name...

1043
01:19:14,766 --> 01:19:18,532
..."to Katherine," which was
my mother's name too.

1044
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:22,729
After the "Katherine"...

1045
01:19:23,141 --> 01:19:25,609
...I had it engraved...

1046
01:19:26,377 --> 01:19:28,470
..."to Joe."

1047
01:19:30,615 --> 01:19:32,378
I want to confess!

1048
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,040
Let me go!

1049
01:19:34,219 --> 01:19:35,777
I threw stones at him!

1050
01:19:35,987 --> 01:19:37,318
I helped kill him!

1051
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:40,583
I'm guilty! We're all guilty!

1052
01:19:40,759 --> 01:19:45,162
Let me ask her to forgive me!
Please, please, forgive me!

1053
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:46,920
Forgive me!

1054
01:19:47,098 --> 01:19:49,157
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1055
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,062
Forgive me!

1056
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:54,069
...there is your answer to this case!

1057
01:19:56,107 --> 01:19:59,099
That letter cinched it for us, didn't it?

1058
01:20:00,078 --> 01:20:02,103
Yeah, why?

1059
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:05,474
It was certainly lucky for us
that it showed up...

1060
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:08,414
...wasn't it?
- Stop talking about it.

1061
01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:10,144
I mean...

1062
01:20:10,321 --> 01:20:12,687
...where does it get you?

1063
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:18,794
- Why didn't you tell me Joe was alive?
- What?

1064
01:20:18,963 --> 01:20:21,796
- Are you crazy?
- I know he's alive, Charlie. I know.

1065
01:20:21,966 --> 01:20:23,991
Will you shut your mouth?

1066
01:20:24,536 --> 01:20:27,164
You can't keep me quiet.
What's happened to him?

1067
01:20:27,338 --> 01:20:30,603
Does he realize what he's done?
What we've all done?

1068
01:20:30,775 --> 01:20:32,640
- Where is he?
- You saw him.

1069
01:20:32,811 --> 01:20:34,802
You saw him in that fire.
Why ask me?

1070
01:20:34,979 --> 01:20:37,948
You testified, not me. I wasn't there.

1071
01:20:38,116 --> 01:20:40,812
You're losing your mind again.

1072
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,611
Of course.

1073
01:20:44,989 --> 01:20:47,184
Of course you're right.

1074
01:20:49,794 --> 01:20:52,319
I don't know what's the matter with me.

1075
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:54,828
Of course you're right.

1076
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,660
He's dead.

1077
01:20:57,969 --> 01:21:01,132
But I haven't slept for so long.

1078
01:21:01,973 --> 01:21:03,964
I want to go.

1079
01:21:04,142 --> 01:21:06,702
I can't listen to any more.
I want to go home.

1080
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,513
It was that letter that made her jump.
I don't know...

1081
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:13,913
You're trying to make yourself important.

1082
01:21:14,085 --> 01:21:17,248
- Katherine suspicious? You're daffy!
- I'm daffy!

1083
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:20,390
Take a look at your radio.
I tell you, that letter...

1084
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:23,391
That letter was the best idea I ever had.

1085
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:26,997
Yeah. Almost cost me my finger
getting that ring off.

1086
01:21:27,165 --> 01:21:31,465
But it was worth it. It would have been
worth the whole hand. Two hands.

1087
01:21:32,036 --> 01:21:35,233
Tom, why don't you stick with me?
You know as well...

1088
01:21:35,406 --> 01:21:38,773
Yeah, you're right.
What's the use of fighting with him?

1089
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:42,879
Anyway, she's home now.
We got the landlady to put her to bed.

1090
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:46,673
Must have been some sensation
when that woman collapsed.

1091
01:21:46,885 --> 01:21:49,217
They could stand seeing
me burned to death.

1092
01:21:49,387 --> 01:21:51,981
- They can't stand an honest trial.
- Cut it out!

1093
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:54,750
I can't stand it!
I can't hear any more!

1094
01:21:54,926 --> 01:21:58,885
You haven't been watching them.
You didn't look in their eyes.

1095
01:21:59,063 --> 01:22:03,227
- Yellow-livered welsher, sorry for them.
- You're as bad! You're lynching me!

1096
01:22:03,401 --> 01:22:07,861
It's getting me too. I wish I hadn't
started the whole thing. I was with you.

1097
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:10,701
But I got a feeling you talked
me into something.

1098
01:22:10,875 --> 01:22:12,706
If I could think of a way out...

1099
01:22:12,877 --> 01:22:14,435
Why don't you snitch on me!

1100
01:22:14,612 --> 01:22:18,742
- Nobody's talking about that!
- I am! I can't stand it any longer!

1101
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:20,949
Be human, Joe.

1102
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:23,383
We can get out of the country,
start over.

1103
01:22:23,554 --> 01:22:27,957
But let's tell them the truth.
Let's tell them you're alive!

1104
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,893
I'll kill you first.

1105
01:22:34,432 --> 01:22:37,333
You might as well kill me too.

1106
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:44,307
You brought her here, you lying...

1107
01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:45,942
No, Joe. I followed them!

1108
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:50,945
I knew you were alive when I saw your
letter. Why not kill me! Do a good job!

1109
01:22:51,115 --> 01:22:55,017
What difference does it make?
Twenty-two, 23, 25!

1110
01:22:55,186 --> 01:22:57,654
- Listen to me, Joe.
- No!

1111
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:01,853
I'm sorry.

1112
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,528
I didn't mean to talk that way.

1113
01:23:04,696 --> 01:23:08,188
Joe, I understand how you feel...

1114
01:23:08,366 --> 01:23:10,834
...and I understand
why you feel that way.

1115
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:12,970
When I thought you were dead...

1116
01:23:13,137 --> 01:23:16,368
...when I thought of what killed you,
I wanted revenge too.

1117
01:23:16,574 --> 01:23:18,132
But now I don't.

1118
01:23:18,309 --> 01:23:22,678
I want to be happy again. I want what
we've always promised each other.

1119
01:23:22,847 --> 01:23:25,816
You ought to have violins
playing when you talk.

1120
01:23:25,984 --> 01:23:29,818
- I know what I want, and I'm getting it!
- You're hanging 22 people!

1121
01:23:29,988 --> 01:23:33,287
No, I'm not. I'm hanging 22 rats
for something they did do.

1122
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,289
- These are 22 human beings.
- Yeah.

1123
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:38,623
- They live and breathe.
- Like me in the jail, for instance!

1124
01:23:38,796 --> 01:23:41,856
They're not murderers.
They were part of a mob.

1125
01:23:42,033 --> 01:23:46,367
- A mob doesn't think. It hasn't time.
- What about the guy in jail? He can think.

1126
01:23:46,537 --> 01:23:50,337
All right, it's his turn. Let them know
what it means to be lynched.

1127
01:23:50,508 --> 01:23:52,669
- Don't you think they know by now?
- No.

1128
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:57,713
What you've felt for a few hours,
they've had to face for days and weeks!

1129
01:23:57,882 --> 01:24:02,546
Wishing, with all their souls, they could
have that one day to live over again.

1130
01:24:04,355 --> 01:24:05,879
Joe...

1131
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:08,758
...don't you see?

1132
01:24:09,227 --> 01:24:12,196
We can be together and be happy.

1133
01:24:13,664 --> 01:24:16,360
Let me go with you to the judge.

1134
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:19,734
And then we can start all over again.

1135
01:24:19,904 --> 01:24:22,429
Stop thinking about them.
Think about me.

1136
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:24,835
I am thinking about you.

1137
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:27,102
About what a swell guy you were...

1138
01:24:27,278 --> 01:24:30,338
...when you were alive.
- When I was alive?

1139
01:24:30,515 --> 01:24:33,348
If those people die, Joe Wilson dies.
You know that.

1140
01:24:33,518 --> 01:24:36,351
Wherever you go. Whatever you do.

1141
01:24:37,555 --> 01:24:39,887
I couldn't marry you now, Joe.

1142
01:24:40,191 --> 01:24:42,421
I couldn't marry a dead man.

1143
01:24:42,593 --> 01:24:45,790
All right, then, all right!
I don't need anybody!

1144
01:24:45,963 --> 01:24:47,430
Nobody!

1145
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,464
Maybe this is crazy.

1146
01:24:52,804 --> 01:24:56,240
I can't help thinking we'd be
better off if you hadn't escaped.

1147
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:58,898
That's what you can't help thinking?
Who cares?

1148
01:24:59,077 --> 01:25:01,568
This is a big night.
I ought to be celebrating.

1149
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:04,738
And that's what I'm gonna do too!
Celebrate. Alone!

1150
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:09,250
From now on, I'm gonna do everything
alone! I don't need any of you!

1151
01:25:22,433 --> 01:25:24,196
Hey.

1152
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:26,568
- Yes?
- This stuff's weak.

1153
01:25:26,737 --> 01:25:28,432
- Get me bourbon.
- Sorry, sir...

1154
01:25:28,606 --> 01:25:32,269
...but with the kind of license
we have here, it's against the law.

1155
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,100
All right. Give me a check.

1156
01:25:34,278 --> 01:25:38,510
- I'm sorry, sir, if you feel...
- No. It's all right. It's just, it's too noisy.

1157
01:25:38,716 --> 01:25:40,911
I don't like crowded places.

1158
01:26:03,107 --> 01:26:06,975
<i>Are you planning to do a lot of running</i>
<i>around in this room?</i>

1159
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:15,211
Have a good time...

1160
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,916
...and bye-bye.

1161
01:26:40,912 --> 01:26:43,005
Come in, mister.

1162
01:26:43,948 --> 01:26:46,109
- What's your pleasure?
- Double bourbon.

1163
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:48,081
Yes, sir.

1164
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:01,326
Midnight, and another day.

1165
01:27:06,504 --> 01:27:09,302
Two pages must've got hanged together.

1166
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:48,745
<i>Do a good job of it!</i>
<i>What does it matter?</i>

1167
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:52,314
<i>Twenty-two, 23, 25!</i>

1168
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,829
Katherine! Katherine!

1169
01:29:05,523 --> 01:29:10,153
Katherine, don't leave me alone.

1170
01:29:22,073 --> 01:29:24,439
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1171
01:29:24,608 --> 01:29:27,270
...have you agreed upon a verdict?

1172
01:29:27,478 --> 01:29:28,877
We have, Your Honor.

1173
01:29:29,046 --> 01:29:32,106
You will hand the verdict
to the bailiff.

1174
01:29:39,557 --> 01:29:43,459
We find in the case of the people of
the state versus the defendants...

1175
01:29:43,627 --> 01:29:47,723
...charged with the murder of Joseph
Wilson as set forth in the indictment.

1176
01:29:47,898 --> 01:29:50,025
Jasper Anderson, not guilty.

1177
01:29:51,135 --> 01:29:53,899
Gilbert Clark, not guilty.

1178
01:29:54,071 --> 01:29:57,939
Richard Durkin, guilty.

1179
01:29:58,109 --> 01:30:00,737
Walter Dubbs, guilty.

1180
01:30:00,911 --> 01:30:03,277
Kirby Dawson, guilty.

1181
01:30:03,447 --> 01:30:05,779
Frederick Garrett, guilty.

1182
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:09,249
- Walter Gordon, guilty.
- No, no! I'm not. Not me!

1183
01:30:09,420 --> 01:30:11,718
Go ahead, go ahead, get it over with!

1184
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:32,775
Order in the court!

1185
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:40,481
Your Honor, I am Joseph Wilson.

1186
01:30:40,651 --> 01:30:42,915
Keep your seats!

1187
01:30:44,188 --> 01:30:46,418
- Go on.
- I know that by coming here...

1188
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:49,616
...I saved the lives of these 22 people.

1189
01:30:49,827 --> 01:30:53,957
But that isn't why I'm here. I don't care
anything about saving them.

1190
01:30:54,165 --> 01:30:58,295
They're murderers. I know the law
says they're not because I'm still alive.

1191
01:30:58,469 --> 01:31:00,130
But that's not their fault.

1192
01:31:00,438 --> 01:31:04,772
And the law doesn't know that a lot of
things that were very important to me...

1193
01:31:04,942 --> 01:31:08,434
...silly things, maybe,
like a belief in justice...

1194
01:31:08,612 --> 01:31:11,706
...and an idea that men were civilized...

1195
01:31:12,349 --> 01:31:17,218
...and a feeling of pride that this country
of mine was different from all others.

1196
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:21,586
The law doesn't know those things were
burned to death within me that night.

1197
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:24,320
I came here today for my own sake.

1198
01:31:24,528 --> 01:31:26,393
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1199
01:31:26,597 --> 01:31:30,795
I couldn't stop thinking about them,
with every step and every breath I took.

1200
01:31:30,968 --> 01:31:34,199
And I didn't believe Katherine
when she said...

1201
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:40,141
Katherine is the young lady
who was going to marry me.

1202
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:43,644
Maybe someday after
I've paid for what I did...

1203
01:31:43,814 --> 01:31:46,681
...there'll be a chance to begin again.

1204
01:31:47,017 --> 01:31:49,349
And then maybe...

1205
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,348
...Katherine and I...
- Joe.

1206

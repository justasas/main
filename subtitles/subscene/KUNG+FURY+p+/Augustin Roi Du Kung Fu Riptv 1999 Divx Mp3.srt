1
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,143
I'm calling for the widower's wife.

2
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,114
Are you the person in charge of...

3
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,253
you're not?

4
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,426
Who is?

5
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,324
In charge of casting extras.

6
00:00:28,765 --> 00:00:31,165
It's all over?

7
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,627
May I speak to someone
about kitty-crunch?

8
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:39,571
"Excuse me, but this kitty-crunch ad.,"

9
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:41,203
...is aimed at what audience?

10
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,713
Mostly men or women?

11
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,985
Cats? That's very interesting.

12
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:50,519
May I ask...
what kind of cats exactly?

13
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:54,785
"I'm wondering because statistically,"

14
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:59,562
most cats have brown eyes.
Green-brown eyes

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,529
which happens to fit my profile well.

16
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:05,739
"My front-view profile, that is."

17
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,208
Are you producing poppy's return?

18
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:14,350
Do you still need a Swiss terrorist?

19
00:01:15,186 --> 00:01:18,748
I can come whenever you like.

20
00:01:19,157 --> 00:01:20,681
Now?

21
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,723
That's a pity.
I've an urgent appointment.

22
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:28,159
Some other time.

23
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:33,914
"Is that you, Augustin?"

24
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,546
"Hello, Mrs. Haton."

25
00:04:35,723 --> 00:04:37,953
Come a bit closer.

26
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:41,086
I can't see you very well.

27
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:46,032
When can you come read to me?

28
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,829
Soon

29
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:51,733
can you remember where we were?

30
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,610
I marked the page
but the paper fell out.

31
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,543
"Well, Jackie..."

32
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,617
met that ugly guy with a boat
on a Greek island.

33
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:05,715
Onassis right

34
00:05:05,925 --> 00:05:09,020
she doesn't like him much at first.

35
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:11,160
But he's very wealthy

36
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,923
...and so is she.

37
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,629
- Will she marry him?
- We don't know yet

38
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:18,830
of course she will!

39
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:24,079
But does it really matter?

40
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,214
Maybe not.

41
00:05:46,206 --> 00:05:48,174
"Faster, tang!"

42
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:57,244
That's better.

43
00:06:07,498 --> 00:06:09,898
Sauerkraut a la Strasbourg?

44
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,472
Why didn't you call me?

45
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:19,176
"Strasbourg, a la sauerkraut."

46
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,304
Cut!

47
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,080
It's the other way around.

48
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,817
Sauerkraut a la Strasbourg. Of course

49
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,715
"twice in a lifetime, 24-7, take 18."

50
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,025
Action!

51
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,161
"I tried to call, then I forgot."

52
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,398
"As they say,"you haven't changed.""

53
00:06:40,737 --> 00:06:44,002
You don't have to say it.
Isn't it hot in here?

54
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,573
So why didn't you phone?

55
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,745
- I don't know -two sauerkrauts

56
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:51,577
a la...

57
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,749
was it Salzburg?

58
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,486
What town was it?

59
00:06:56,623 --> 00:07:00,218
A city in eastern France
with a big cathedral.

60
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,520
With two spires?

61
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,730
Exactly.

62
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,431
"24-7, take 31."

63
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,941
Sauerkraut a la Strasbourg.

64
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,749
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing?

65
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:24,915
You're a waiter
present the food and put it down!

66
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,222
I only had a week to rehearse my part.

67
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:31,895
I've broken it down into three phases.

68
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:34,224
Motion phase: I appear.

69
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:36,896
Static phase: Present the sauerkraut.

70
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:40,632
Last phase: Touchdown. I lower the food.

71
00:07:41,743 --> 00:07:44,143
Let's do it. Go ahead.

72
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:45,874
We're not rolling.

73
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,781
We weren't rolling.

74
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:53,550
May I have some tea?

75
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:07,632
"The crew seem tired, don't they?"

76
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:10,333
We all have off days.

77
00:08:10,877 --> 00:08:14,041
At times you can stumble over
the easiest lines

78
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:17,274
the results can be surprising.

79
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:21,613
I agree. The lines aren't
that important.

80
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,983
- They're not? - no

81
00:08:24,393 --> 00:08:26,190
it's body language.

82
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,687
"The neck, for instance.
It supports the face."

83
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,094
A neckless face...
hasn't a leg to stand on.

84
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:36,073
"Then you have feet, for balance."

85
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:38,367
Balance is inherently unstable.

86
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,240
So you have your feet to thank
for your balance.

87
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:45,885
I agree. The body's vital.

88
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:48,882
I only do physical roles now.

89
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,787
Like what? Stunts? Song-and-dance?

90
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:54,484
"No, only kung fu."

91
00:08:54,528 --> 00:08:56,690
You know kung fu?

92
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:58,192
Not really.

93
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:01,995
"Pity. It's like boxing,
only it's Chinese."

94
00:09:02,271 --> 00:09:05,934
"I'm not Chinese, but I'm good at it."

95
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:09,671
Are many kung fu movies made in France?

96
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:13,013
"I know, it seems a bit impossible..."

97
00:09:13,518 --> 00:09:17,546
but impossible things aren't
always impossible.

98
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,551
True.

99
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:21,992
Fanny? Five minutes.

100
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:22,961
Coming.

101
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:25,793
You should get going.

102
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,028
Can you cope with all your lines?

103
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:29,635
I'm used to it.

104
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,999
"Well, goodbye."

105
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,469
Sorry. I have a problem shaking hands.

106
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,772
I understand. What's your name?

107
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:42,340
Dos Santos. It was Portuguese.

108
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,354
"Bye, then."

109
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,752
Good luck.

110
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:59,233
"Faster, tang!
You're as stiff as your stick!"

111
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,541
Big oaf!

112
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,573
You'll never beat Wang Chu.

113
00:10:04,745 --> 00:10:06,839
You stand no chance against him

114
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:08,746
...unless you learn from me.

115
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,395
Bring me a bowl of tea and sit down.

116
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:25,231
"You have fire and youth on your side,"

117
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:29,229
but you know nothing yet. Nothing!

118
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,905
You must continue working here.

119
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:35,380
Leave your family and friends.

120
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,847
It is the only way.

121
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:40,687
Are you listening?

122
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,018
"Yes, you!"

123
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,190
"You're a man of good will,
Mr. Dos Santos,"

124
00:10:46,595 --> 00:10:49,827
but you still have far to go.

125
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:53,330
Hard work lies ahead.

126
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,605
"To do it, you must create a void
inside you."

127
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,742
Seek out new horizons.

128
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:03,808
Renounce your surroundings.

129
00:11:04,115 --> 00:11:06,641
"Go far,"

130
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,216
far away.

131
00:11:08,254 --> 00:11:10,313
"Back to the roots,"

132
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:13,559
"the birthplace of kung fu,"

133
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:17,223
the land of the warrior monks.

134
00:11:21,002 --> 00:11:24,404
It may be nearer than you think.

135
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,021
I'm going to miss you.

136
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:48,824
Who will read to me?

137
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,296
I don't know.

138
00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:53,999
I'll be going.

139
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,107
How about a hug?

140
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,545
Actually... I'd rather not.

141
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,549
"Goodbye, Mrs. Haton."

142
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:08,291
'Evening.

143
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,498
Is this hotel Chinese?

144
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,003
"I'm afraid so, yes."

145
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:14,198
Great! You have a room?

146
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,806
How much?

147
00:14:16,075 --> 00:14:19,239
"150 francs. Shower, no breakfast.
One night?"

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,973
"No! Much more. I can't say how long,
but long."

149
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,418
Your name? Dos Santos

150
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:32,455
"two "osses". One with a d,
one with a sant."

151
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,188
Does the room face east?

152
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:39,226
"Rise to the east, sleep to the west.
Ideally."

153
00:15:57,162 --> 00:15:59,562
Arms back. Tiger stance!

154
00:16:05,471 --> 00:16:06,700
Loosen up.

155
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,645
Can I help you?

156
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,977
Are you master Wang?

157
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:22,884
I saw the sign with all your diplomas.

158
00:16:23,193 --> 00:16:24,990
You trained in china?

159
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:28,162
You're sure? Your french is good.

160
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:31,526
- I've been here 20 years.
- I got here yesterday.

161
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,771
"I think, to study kung fu,"

162
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:36,365
a Chinese environment is best.

163
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:38,075
As Chinese as possible.

164
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:42,405
Return to the roots.
Renounce my surroundings

165
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:45,077
beginner? Far from it.

166
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:49,016
I'm highly trained.
I need to work on details.

167
00:16:49,357 --> 00:16:51,382
"For instance, if I may say so,"

168
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,652
"when you showed the tiger stance,"

169
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,731
your tiger's claws looked
more like goat's feet.

170
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:00,494
They did? Explain.

171
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:03,404
I'll demonstrate. It's easier.

172
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:05,332
Stand by!

173
00:17:15,421 --> 00:17:16,889
See my claws?

174
00:17:17,457 --> 00:17:19,220
Where did you learn that?

175
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:34,276
Hi. I'd like to open a bank account.

176
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,368
"Certainly, sir."

177
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,543
How much do you have?

178
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,175
"6,250 francs. French francs."

179
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:42,579
I didn't bring the coins.

180
00:17:43,955 --> 00:17:46,355
How much is that in Yuan?
Hold on.

181
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,059
"That makes about 8,872 Yuan."

182
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:52,655
Not bad.

183
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,935
"Waterfalls. Niagara-style,
but in Mongolia."

184
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:36,580
Mongolia? Genghis khan?
Guts and carnage?

185
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:41,381
"No! Gushing cascades,
constantly glimmering."

186
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:45,554
Only a power cut stops it.
Then all goes black.

187
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:49,258
"Look at these colors.
Mauve, gray, yellow, pink..."

188
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,062
...the lot!

189
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:53,326
Forever flowing for family fun.

190
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,335
For young and old alike.

191
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,939
Where would it go?

192
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,340
Good question. You can put it anywhere!

193
00:18:59,544 --> 00:19:01,570
"Hall, bedroom, living room."

194
00:19:01,613 --> 00:19:05,071
Not the toilet. Although...
it's soothing. Relaxing.

195
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:08,219
"Rousing, too. It's energizing!"

196
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:12,248
It's sensual! This cascade is
like a silken caress.

197
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,050
Never goes out of style.

198
00:19:14,261 --> 00:19:16,195
And guaranteed never to dry up.

199
00:19:16,398 --> 00:19:18,866
You can't beat the price.

200
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:22,231
It's so low it's painful.

201
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:25,741
You know our name! Cheap'n... - china.

202
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,336
Right! Take a wild guess.

203
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:31,405
"No, much less! 1,299 francs."

204
00:19:31,448 --> 00:19:33,940
It's as low as I can go.

205
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,225
That's 14 francs 50.

206
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,529
Are you looking for help?

207
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:47,596
Is that man the boss?

208
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:49,700
Is the boss here?

209
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:05,146
Why hesitate? Pay for it over two years!

210
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:41,161
Sorry. No problem.

211
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:47,766
"If you need anything, just knock room 21"

212
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,745
today we make contact.

213
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:52,109
Could you make a little less noise?

214
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:53,648
What's the problem?

215
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:57,517
He's too loud. He doesn't understand.

216
00:22:00,492 --> 00:22:03,484
Should he really be clutching my arm?

217
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:06,054
"In combat sports, contact is necessary."

218
00:22:06,098 --> 00:22:09,226
Contact? How awful. Can't it be avoided?

219
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:13,733
No. Try marbles or monopoly. Go on.

220
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:35,356
"I'm dizzy. Sorry, I don't feel well."

221
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,833
Dr. Ling's office?

222
00:23:39,242 --> 00:23:41,472
Could you repeat that?

223
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,640
Come in.

224
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:23,660
Good afternoon.

225
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,461
I'm here to see Dr. Ling.

226
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:27,124
I am Dr. Ling.

227
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:30,334
Pardon me. I expected a man.

228
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,266
Follow me.

229
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,003
Now? Yes.

230
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,002
I have one quick question.

231
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,341
I'm free. This way...

232
00:24:38,612 --> 00:24:40,045
just for a moment.

233
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,373
I'm in good health. Great health.

234
00:24:46,254 --> 00:24:48,654
Please excuse my bad french.

235
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,127
"I'm taking lessons.
I'll be better soon, I hope."

236
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:54,387
I'll be taking lessons too.

237
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:58,458
In Chinese. Lots of people
speak it fluently.

238
00:24:58,668 --> 00:25:02,730
What brings you here?
What's the problem?

239
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:04,639
I don't really have one.

240
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:07,611
"By the way, how much do you charge?"

241
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,238
100 francs. Okay?

242
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:10,604
Yes.

243
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,349
Go ahead.

244
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:15,482
I'm a top-notch athlete.

245
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,717
I'm learning Chinese boxing.

246
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:19,225
To act in kung fu films.

247
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:23,094
It's fine. The training's
going normally.

248
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:28,964
"I have one handicap.
Trivial, but annoying."

249
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,597
What is the problem?

250
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:35,436
The problem is... touching.
Making contact.

251
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,148
We fight with one another and have to...

252
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:40,515
it's most unpleasant.

253
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:46,151
Contact? Shaking hands? Being touched?

254
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,820
"Yes. It starts where I'm touched,
then moves up."

255
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,921
"Up to my elbows is bearable,"

256
00:25:51,998 --> 00:25:55,833
but sometimes it reaches
my shoulders and head.

257
00:25:55,870 --> 00:26:00,240
Then I get dizzy and hot.
Hotter and hotter.

258
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:03,870
"Then suddenly, I'm cold. Ice-cold."

259
00:26:03,912 --> 00:26:08,543
Then I'm totally paralyzed.
Maybe it's no big deal.

260
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,810
Do you dream a lot?

261
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,315
I don't think so.

262
00:26:12,356 --> 00:26:14,586
Are you a good eater?

263
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:18,926
I eat cereals and vegetables.
Mostly broccoli.

264
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:25,128
Are you color sensitive?
What colors do you like?

265
00:26:25,204 --> 00:26:26,831
Why is that important?

266
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:29,269
"It helps locate your inner peace,"

267
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:32,768
but you don't have to answer now.

268
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:35,581
Show me your tongue.

269
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,314
Really?

270
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:39,884
Stick it out.

271
00:26:42,925 --> 00:26:44,655
More.

272
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,855
It's very white.

273
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,190
Very white?

274
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:53,293
Your energy isn't circulating well.

275
00:26:53,337 --> 00:26:54,703
Is that bad?

276
00:26:54,973 --> 00:26:56,736
Everything is curable.

277
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:59,603
Can you undress?
Do I have to?

278
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:01,473
The top?

279
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:05,582
Everything. You can keep
your underpants on.

280
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:07,448
That's lucky.

281
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,625
Please lie down.

282
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,795
That looks sharp.

283
00:27:20,836 --> 00:27:21,804
Relax.

284
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:25,401
Close your eyes.

285
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:26,734
Both of them?

286
00:27:27,011 --> 00:27:28,205
Of course.

287
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:33,418
Are you okay? Not hurting?

288
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,181
Will it leave holes?

289
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:42,527
Did you find it?
Is it listed in the book?

290
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:45,960
I don't think it's a skin-problem

291
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,030
the surface is only a symptom.

292
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:52,734
"The book says,"water lilies
can grow on dry land."

293
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,067
"...but when they do,"

294
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:59,172
"there must be a hidden spring nearby.""

295
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,380
We have to dig.
Dig?

296
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,382
Dig where?

297
00:28:06,358 --> 00:28:07,825
Good reaction.

298
00:28:08,526 --> 00:28:09,959
Am I cured?

299
00:28:09,995 --> 00:28:13,989
We've just begun. Step by step
for best results.

300
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:20,105
Interesting case. You're my
first french patient.

301
00:28:34,891 --> 00:28:38,293
- Can I see the boss?
- He's in his office

302
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:49,098
can I help you?

303
00:28:49,142 --> 00:28:52,942
I live nearby. I'm a customer here.

304
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:56,412
Let me say first how much
I like your goods.

305
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,010
I love the wicker basket I bought.

306
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:01,648
It's excellent. For broccoli.

307
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,184
Thank you.

308
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,483
It's expertly woven

309
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:06,789
...and barely smells.

310
00:29:06,962 --> 00:29:10,125
"From now on, you can count on me."

311
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:12,634
I won't shop elsewhere.

312
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:19,736
Your clientele is fascinating.
Do you work alone?

313
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:23,646
You sell such a variety
and quantity of goods.

314
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,952
Where's the flowered teapot folder?

315
00:29:28,254 --> 00:29:29,380
Down there.

316
00:29:29,823 --> 00:29:32,053
I'm pretty free these days.

317
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,788
I like this place.

318
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:37,127
"If you're overworked, I can help."

319
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:40,130
Don't bother. We're not hiring.

320
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:41,328
"Right, Mr. Li?"

321
00:29:41,403 --> 00:29:43,895
"Sorry to insist, but here"

322
00:29:43,973 --> 00:29:46,771
...I'll meet Chinese people. I need to.

323
00:29:47,043 --> 00:29:49,012
The streets are full of them.

324
00:29:49,046 --> 00:29:50,673
Train me.

325
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,314
The answer's no.

326
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:58,413
I'm not asking for money.
I have enough for now.

327
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,418
I'll work for free.

328
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:02,620
For free?

329
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,892
For free...

330
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,330
at first.

331
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:12,037
Did you leave china long ago?

332
00:30:12,106 --> 00:30:14,199
A year and a half ago.

333
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,676
But you live with family here.

334
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:19,340
Cousins. Not very close.

335
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:22,249
Until I find someplace else.

336
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,218
"Try to relax, please! D"

337
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,188
is acupuncture an old art?
As old as kung fu?

338
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,461
"Older, 2000 years."

339
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,766
2000 years? It must take
forever to learn.

340
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:43,064
I was taught by my uncle in canton.

341
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:47,174
"A very good doctor,
but more conventional."

342
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:50,916
He taught me basics. Good and solid.

343
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:52,943
I use it for foundation.

344
00:30:53,254 --> 00:30:55,189
Sometimes I invent.

345
00:30:55,457 --> 00:30:57,186
Has this been tested?

346
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:59,525
Is it scientific?
Of course.

347
00:30:59,829 --> 00:31:03,492
But it's hard to explain to you.

348
00:31:03,533 --> 00:31:05,764
My french is not yet good enough.

349
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:07,903
Try in Chinese

350
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:15,077
I'll leave you now. Empty your mind.

351
00:32:29,435 --> 00:32:33,497
I'm glad you slept a little.
It's progress.

352
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,974
Same time tomorrow?

353
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:40,709
"Better to wait a few days.
Too fast, not good."

354
00:32:47,056 --> 00:32:50,026
You may feel some side-effects.

355
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,188
Don't worry. We'll see this through.

356
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:56,532
I'm on the right track.

357
00:33:11,985 --> 00:33:15,284
"Dos Santos, what are you doing?
Come and listen."

358
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:19,657
Kitchen appliances...
lemon squeezer - easy.

359
00:33:19,694 --> 00:33:22,289
Blender - no comment.

360
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:25,234
Very important! What is this?

361
00:33:25,234 --> 00:33:27,897
"Carpet sweeper?
No, d387 crumber."

362
00:33:27,938 --> 00:33:31,669
"Study it well. A banal, everyday object.
But!"

363
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:36,080
Crumbs collect in this special cavity.

364
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,485
Beware of eggshell! It jams the works.

365
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,021
Made in Macao.

366
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:46,525
You're Portuguese. Macao? Gambling dens?

367
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,856
Not your thing.

368
00:33:47,894 --> 00:33:50,455
Are you listening?

369
00:33:50,498 --> 00:33:53,296
Come see our chinaware.

370
00:33:53,334 --> 00:33:56,930
"You're crazy, working here for free!"

371
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:59,202
"If you get hurt,
don't expect compensation."

372
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:03,508
Let me tell you about the Chinese mind.

373
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,650
"They're smart cookies, not easy to con."

374
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,519
Make them laugh.
Don't underestimate them.

375
00:34:10,555 --> 00:34:13,558
They're no country bumpkins.
Repeat after me:

376
00:34:13,558 --> 00:34:19,395
The customer arrives. We speak first.

377
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,367
"Confidently, masterfully,"

378
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:25,667
"with a twinkle, an old pal
doing her a favor."

379
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:29,107
Listen hard. Picture the scene.

380
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:32,739
"Chinese housewife arrives.
Shopping bag full,"

381
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,317
"purse almost empty. She walks around,"

382
00:34:35,317 --> 00:34:38,253
unaware of the lurking danger.

383
00:34:38,321 --> 00:34:40,623
"You pounce, smiling. She's yours,"

384
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:43,320
a captive customer at your command.

385
00:34:43,394 --> 00:34:46,420
"Sell her a dream! A wok,
a flowerpot holder,"

386
00:34:46,497 --> 00:34:49,334
"a singing doll, a toilet seat!"

387
00:34:49,334 --> 00:34:51,928
She's glowing. And grateful.

388
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,337
She can pay for it over ten years.

389
00:34:54,507 --> 00:34:57,271
What next? Give her a bonus.

390
00:34:57,343 --> 00:34:58,776
A trinket?

391
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:01,882
"Any old crap. Incense, matches..."

392
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:03,543
anything cheap and cheerful.

393
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:06,319
Dos Santos! Wake up!

394
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,448
I'm undergoing intensive therapy.

395
00:35:09,491 --> 00:35:11,687
"I don't give a damn, kiddo."

396
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:14,628
Useless! Doesn't have it in him.

397
00:35:14,663 --> 00:35:17,189
I give him my best and he nods off.

398
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:19,698
"Hello, Mrs. Pei."

399
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,336
How's missy?

400
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:22,839
What cute pigtails.

401
00:35:42,964 --> 00:35:45,558
Dr. Ling. It's urgent.

402
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,632
Acupuncture.

403
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:51,400
I don't understand french.

404
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:57,438
Try the living Buddha club.

405
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,379
Thanks.

406
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:39,490
Sir?

407
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,965
Is miss ling here?

408
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,367
She's downstairs.

409
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:48,367
What's this?

410
00:36:48,408 --> 00:36:49,898
The sacre coeur!

411
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:52,644
And this?

412
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:54,181
The pantheon!

413
00:36:54,382 --> 00:36:56,543
What's written on the front of it?

414
00:36:56,818 --> 00:37:00,277
"To the nation's great men,
with thanks"

415
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,482
yes. Many great Frenchmen
are buried there.

416
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:07,758
"Remember,"thanks"has an"s"at the end"

417
00:37:07,931 --> 00:37:11,493
"think of a snake."hisss""

418
00:37:11,802 --> 00:37:13,599
who is this famous woman?

419
00:37:13,638 --> 00:37:15,573
The mona lisa!

420
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:18,175
With her enigmatic smile.

421
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,203
"Enigmatic, from "enigma".
A synonym, please?"

422
00:37:21,648 --> 00:37:23,639
"Ling?"mysterious""

423
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,747
"very good. Now,"

424
00:37:25,985 --> 00:37:27,248
everyday words.

425
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:28,488
Bottle.

426
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,653
Cauliflower.

427
00:37:32,694 --> 00:37:33,888
Broccoli!

428
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:41,593
"Like you said, I'm getting side-effects."

429
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:44,402
- Strong ones. - it's normal.

430
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:53,106
I need emergency treatment.
You do first aid?

431
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:58,649
Excuse me. Talismans date
from the qing dynasty?

432
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:01,421
- That's right. - thanks. Goodbye.

433
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,798
Mr. Boutinot knows china like an expert.

434
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,834
What kind of side-effects?

435
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:11,401
Won't your family mind?

436
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,907
Don't worry about them.

437
00:38:12,941 --> 00:38:15,934
I pay rent. I can do as I like.

438
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,682
Is much of Paris like this?

439
00:38:20,717 --> 00:38:21,844
Not really.

440
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:25,016
I only know Chinatown.

441
00:38:25,055 --> 00:38:28,651
"You're a foreigner here, like me!"

442
00:38:28,993 --> 00:38:30,893
Will you stay here?

443
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,961
I don't know. It's too early to say.

444
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:45,845
What's that?

445
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,281
A first world war memorial.

446
00:38:48,317 --> 00:38:50,751
Were many battles fought in France?

447
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,380
Lots. At least until 1939.

448
00:39:11,244 --> 00:39:13,678
Your teacher speaks good Chinese.

449
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,939
What will you do tonight?

450
00:39:15,983 --> 00:39:20,818
"Your shoulders, chest and
around your heart."

451
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,997
No! What are you doing?

452
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:35,504
Jumping and shouting.

453
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:41,467
"May I suggest a simple,
yet popular gift?"

454
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,378
"These small bowls, or cuplets."

455
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:47,283
For rice liquor. If you like alcohol.
I don't.

456
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,056
"Remarkably, the enamel is
baked into the paste."

457
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,993
See? A traditional technique.

458
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:58,256
There's another very special... feature

459
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:01,400
which may appeal to you-or not.

460
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,731
Let's test it with this fluid.

461
00:40:04,574 --> 00:40:07,805
"Not rice liquor, but kerosene."

462
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:09,778
Now.

463
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:14,483
What appears at the bottom?

464
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:17,879
Correct! A woman.
She's totally undressed.

465
00:40:18,156 --> 00:40:19,589
Quite shameless.

466
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:24,125
She took the part. Why?
For money? I wouldn't.

467
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:27,461
Whatever. Let's not judge her.

468
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:30,726
"Nudity is not my taste,
but it may be yours,"

469
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:32,102
...is it?

470
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:36,403
What's that?

471
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:39,312
That? It's sort of... a clock.

472
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:44,145
Forget it. It's not too ugly
but it's very expensive.

473
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:48,085
"We're called cheap "n" china,
but cheap it's not!"

474
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,758
I'll buy it.

475
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:51,189
You will?

476
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:55,295
"It's a gift, so remove the tag."

477
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:59,202
"You'll need paper, ribbons,
and lot of tape!"

478
00:40:59,605 --> 00:41:01,732
Thank you very much indeed.

479
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:05,000
"3,500 francs."

480
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,809
"Nice work, son. Hats off to you!"

481
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,542
I tried to sell that thing
for god knows how long.

482
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,987
"It's hideous, too!"

483
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:20,218
It was a hardware store.
I owned it for 15 years

484
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:23,733
"then came the invasion.
Nice people, though."

485
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,524
"I sold it well,"

486
00:41:25,602 --> 00:41:27,798
for a very good price.

487
00:41:28,306 --> 00:41:31,868
"Now I'm a manager,"

488
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,346
"it's a cinch! No loans,
no nit-picking inspectors."

489
00:41:35,514 --> 00:41:38,973
"Still, it takes work. Stay in harness,
that's my motto."

490
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:45,749
Are you alone at the hotel?
No girlfriend?

491
00:41:47,027 --> 00:41:49,588
Not now? Or never?

492
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:51,189
Not now.

493
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,835
"Right, who needs them?"

494
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:57,465
So you're out of luck with girls?

495
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:03,269
I'm the opposite; they're
out of luck with me.

496
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:05,573
That's the way it goes.

497
00:42:06,818 --> 00:42:08,547
That's your lunch?

498
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:13,149
"You eat like a jockey. Of course,
you're an athlete."

499
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,421
"For a future kung fu star,
you're not beefy."

500
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:21,328
"You're no Rambo. But clothes
are misleading. Me,"

501
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:24,668
I'm lean for my age. Not a
pinch of fat. Feel it

502
00:42:27,142 --> 00:42:28,837
I think I hit a bone.

503
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:31,140
Bones are harder to build up!

504
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:35,875
Li should put you on a commission.
It's only fair.

505
00:42:36,252 --> 00:42:39,711
I blabber on. You're so quiet...

506
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:43,917
modesty's nice.

507
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:47,090
Sorry to pester you but
you're my savior.

508
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:51,433
My novel's full of details
I must get right.

509
00:42:56,209 --> 00:42:58,302
"Mr. Boutinot, Augustin."

510
00:42:58,345 --> 00:42:59,574
We met before.

511
00:43:00,114 --> 00:43:01,240
"Mr. Ren,"

512
00:43:04,252 --> 00:43:06,278
see you Friday.

513
00:43:10,126 --> 00:43:12,458
Who's she? A friend?

514
00:43:12,495 --> 00:43:13,621
In a way.

515
00:43:17,168 --> 00:43:19,864
Where is it now? Page...

516
00:43:19,904 --> 00:43:21,463
eigth-eight

517
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,105
here's what I write:

518
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:28,580
"As night fell, the firelight
by the river flickered"

519
00:43:28,614 --> 00:43:32,984
"on the grinning old man's
betel-stained teeth""

520
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:36,811
my question is: Would a
Yangtze river-dweller

521
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:39,325
...be chewing betel in 1885?

522
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:40,791
What's betel?

523
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:43,958
Pepper and tobacco mixed with lime.

524
00:43:44,133 --> 00:43:45,225
Leng-yip?

525
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:46,928
It's possible.

526
00:43:47,136 --> 00:43:50,664
"It is? Good, so"betel"can stay."

527
00:43:50,941 --> 00:43:54,878
"Great. If it's published,
I'll owe you a lot."

528
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,411
I'm happy to help.

529
00:43:57,448 --> 00:44:00,179
I didn't take the easy way out...

530
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:02,414
did you find a title?

531
00:44:02,721 --> 00:44:06,522
How's this? I thought of it yesterday:

532
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:09,695
Rice of the ricefields.

533
00:44:09,763 --> 00:44:12,698
"Because of"rice"and"ricefields"."

534
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,299
It's enigmatic.

535
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,504
You have a certain charm.

536
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:22,977
It's not written all over you.

537
00:44:23,012 --> 00:44:27,677
"Deep down, you have that
Portuguese mystique."

538
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:29,816
May I say something?

539
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,657
You sell yourself short.
You should try...

540
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:37,321
try slicking your hair back.

541
00:44:37,663 --> 00:44:40,860
"Or else, grow it longer."

542
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,069
Are you listening?

543
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:47,340
Who is that girl?

544
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,138
My therapist.

545
00:45:06,463 --> 00:45:07,930
That's better.

546
00:45:12,537 --> 00:45:14,266
Hello. How are you?

547
00:45:16,909 --> 00:45:18,968
I need some information.

548
00:45:26,019 --> 00:45:29,456
"Not bad. Now, something harder;"

549
00:45:30,024 --> 00:45:34,553
it was fine this morning but
it'll rain tonight

550
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:45,273
excellent! I'm impressed.
You're talented.

551
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,074
I've studied for years and
been to china twice.

552
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,239
All right. Enough torture for today.

553
00:45:53,051 --> 00:45:54,747
Can I pay you now?

554
00:45:54,787 --> 00:45:56,550
End of the month.

555
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,115
Here. Thanks.

556
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,560
"How do you say,"your treatment
does me good"?"

557
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:06,591
Thanks.

558
00:46:06,635 --> 00:46:08,933
You want to say it to ling?

559
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:10,461
Do you see her often?

560
00:46:10,506 --> 00:46:13,998
In class. Sometimes outside.
My best student.

561
00:46:14,277 --> 00:46:16,906
She'll go far. She has guts.

562
00:46:16,947 --> 00:46:20,314
She was forced to marry in china
and left it all.

563
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:23,115
I admire her a lot.

564
00:46:23,788 --> 00:46:25,653
You know her very well.

565
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:29,752
"Hold it. I'm married,
faithful, monogamous."

566
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:31,764
It's almost a religion for me.

567
00:46:32,799 --> 00:46:35,267
She's been a big inspiration
for my book.

568
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:36,530
For what it's worth...

569
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:41,035
"dear sir, rice of the ricefields"

570
00:46:41,075 --> 00:46:42,839
"...is admirably well researched...""

571
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:45,176
the usual empty flattery...

572
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:51,718
"loaded with images and
tangled metaphors,"

573
00:46:51,754 --> 00:46:56,055
leads the reader into
an inescapable maze.

574
00:46:56,393 --> 00:46:58,919
Your manuscript is not for us.

575
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:03,498
"With our regrets and best wishes
for the future...""

576
00:47:03,535 --> 00:47:05,128
may I see it?

577
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:10,265
Maybe I went wrong.
Maybe it lost its flow.

578
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:13,837
I think it's quite encouraging.

579
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:16,144
Encouraging? Yes.

580
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,578
Regrets means that they liked it.

581
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,880
But regret they can't say so.

582
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:27,253
"And then..."best wishes."
"Best" is a strong word."

583
00:47:27,497 --> 00:47:29,965
"Wishes, too. They're not common."

584
00:47:30,033 --> 00:47:32,969
That's one way of looking at it.

585
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,975
What are you doing?

586
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:44,642
"I'm searching for the vital point,"

587
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:47,346
the center of hidden feelings.

588
00:47:48,088 --> 00:47:50,750
"Today, we must go deeper."

589
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:56,991
I've thought about you.
The answer isn't in books

590
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:58,795
not in the books?

591
00:47:59,368 --> 00:48:03,600
Human matter is more complicated.

592
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:07,808
You have to reach inside
to touch the root.

593
00:48:09,379 --> 00:48:11,974
There. I think I have it.

594
00:48:14,218 --> 00:48:16,346
That's not the usual one.

595
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:18,283
Isn't it too long?

596
00:48:18,657 --> 00:48:21,183
It's a very old Chinese needle.

597
00:48:21,394 --> 00:48:23,089
"I've never used it before,"

598
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:26,293
I'm sure it's necessary now.

599
00:48:27,935 --> 00:48:29,402
Won't it burn?

600
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:32,402
It will hurt a little.

601
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:38,876
Do you feel the heat?

602
00:48:40,249 --> 00:48:43,344
It's very hot. Very hot.

603
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,188
It'll spread all over your body.

604
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:47,520
All over?

605
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:52,392
We must awake what has been
too long asleep.

606
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:10,979
Stop thinking. Isolate yourself.

607
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:13,611
It's moving down.

608
00:49:15,258 --> 00:49:16,691
And up.

609
00:49:16,893 --> 00:49:19,828
Just lie here. Relax.

610
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:09,043
You're leaving?

611
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:11,547
Wait!

612
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,885
It's not finished!

613
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:15,693
Augustin!

614
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:27,740
He's always here.
You trying to marry him?

615
00:50:27,777 --> 00:50:30,610
Butt out! You're not my mother.

616
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:09,723
How are you?

617
00:51:10,794 --> 00:51:12,022
Find it okay?

618
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:13,962
Put your bike there.

619
00:51:15,166 --> 00:51:18,693
"If you get sick of the hotel,
sleep here."

620
00:51:18,737 --> 00:51:21,901
"It's small, but we'll make do."

621
00:51:22,141 --> 00:51:23,665
Stay seated.

622
00:51:23,743 --> 00:51:25,677
- Coffee? - I'd rather not.

623
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,145
You're on the payroll!

624
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:35,553
Li's signing you on at a decent rate.

625
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:36,555
Thanks.

626
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,465
Me and my pompom!

627
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,404
"You, in the navy?
- For years! Tough customers."

628
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:53,139
We had good times.
We traveled the world over.

629
00:51:53,945 --> 00:51:56,413
"Here, a drop of bunyuls."

630
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:57,470
What is it?

631
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:59,279
A liqueur made from wine.

632
00:51:59,318 --> 00:52:02,287
Let your hair down. Try it!

633
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:08,393
Not bad. Reminds me of cough syrup.

634
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,331
You need to learn how to enjoy life.

635
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,663
Let's play some music.

636
00:52:19,608 --> 00:52:22,772
I loved dancing.
I had rhythm in my bones!

637
00:52:22,946 --> 00:52:25,780
I'd dance to anything. I was a natural.

638
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:33,587
Have you seen Mirza?

639
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:40,699
Where did that dog go?

640
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:43,160
I've looked everywhere.

641
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:47,135
Where did that dog go?

642
00:52:47,576 --> 00:52:50,010
He's gonna drive me mad.

643
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:53,338
Where did that dog go?

644
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:58,578
"There he is! Come here, boy."

645
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:03,725
I won't say it again.

646
00:53:04,162 --> 00:53:06,096
"Come here, boy!"

647
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:10,536
"Then beat it, mutt!"

648
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:19,508
It's the last one. It's unique.

649
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:21,845
I've put it on to model it for you.

650
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,678
"It's warm in the winter,
and cool in the summer."

651
00:53:26,054 --> 00:53:27,715
Top-grade silk.

652
00:53:27,756 --> 00:53:29,451
Embroidered with flowers.

653
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:32,393
Japanese garden varieties.

654
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:41,367
"Imported from Xian. The silk route,
you know?"

655
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:43,005
How do you wash it?

656
00:53:43,041 --> 00:53:46,442
"With water, either hard or soft."

657
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:48,646
Hand wash or dry clean?

658
00:53:48,681 --> 00:53:51,650
That's up to you. It's your call.

659
00:53:54,121 --> 00:53:58,422
You've missed a week. I was worried.

660
00:53:58,459 --> 00:54:02,520
"We stayed open late.
Night sales, until 11 PM."

661
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:05,557
And the fish got food poisoning.

662
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:08,168
We had to treat them one by one.

663
00:54:08,437 --> 00:54:11,703
Are you coming to the party tomorrow?

664
00:54:12,142 --> 00:54:14,667
"It's tomorrow? No, I can't."

665
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:17,312
Or maybe. Monday's kung fu.

666
00:54:17,548 --> 00:54:22,213
Shame to stop the treatment
now at the last step.

667
00:54:22,254 --> 00:54:24,347
You abandoned your customer?

668
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:26,756
"No, she... you lost the sale."

669
00:54:27,093 --> 00:54:29,186
Are you here to shop?

670
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:31,198
Just passing through.

671
00:54:31,532 --> 00:54:33,625
Make yourself at home.

672
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:57,191
The seven seas keep us apart

673
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:01,194
...with tears in our heart

674
00:55:01,834 --> 00:55:06,602
"karukera, caledonia"

675
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:12,673
"ouessant, virgin of the seas"

676
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:16,417
"alone, always..."

677
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:22,290
the seven seas keep us apart

678
00:55:23,126 --> 00:55:26,858
...with tears in our heart

679
00:55:43,216 --> 00:55:45,116
good evening to all.

680
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:50,922
Thank you all from the
bottom of my heart.

681
00:55:50,959 --> 00:55:55,090
"For 10 years, you've made
this place wonderful."

682
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:59,528
The nicest place in the area. Thank you.

683
00:55:59,803 --> 00:56:02,033
"We're like one big, extended family:"

684
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:05,440
"...elders, parents, children, cousins..."

685
00:56:05,476 --> 00:56:07,671
"...including me, I'm proud to say."

686
00:56:07,878 --> 00:56:12,043
"I won't take long. I'll introduce
my wife, Chantal."

687
00:56:12,651 --> 00:56:13,743
"Hi, honey."

688
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:15,251
"My daughter, Marion."

689
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:18,286
Enough. Back to the party.

690
00:56:18,558 --> 00:56:21,585
Here's to fun and china the eternal!

691
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:35,098
How are you? Meet my wife.

692
00:56:36,112 --> 00:56:38,877
- This is ling -hi!

693
00:56:39,983 --> 00:56:44,080
Are you settling in?
Parisians aren't too rude?

694
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:45,749
I don't know many.

695
00:56:45,957 --> 00:56:48,756
They're like everyone.
They grumble a bit.

696
00:56:48,794 --> 00:56:52,891
Thanks for helping with his book.

697
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:54,157
Excuse me.

698
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,817
It's a success.

699
00:57:45,861 --> 00:57:48,695
Yes! It's weird. No one seems bored.

700
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,062
You look different.

701
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,330
"The lipstick, maybe."

702
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,563
Big difference!

703
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:56,663
Everyday not workday. Forget needles

704
00:57:56,707 --> 00:57:57,731
dance?

705
00:57:57,975 --> 00:57:59,341
I can't.

706
00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:01,244
Try.

707
00:58:02,214 --> 00:58:04,012
I've never danced.

708
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,551
It's a party. Come on.

709
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,690
"Good! We can see if contact problem
is cured,"

710
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,790
...in everyday life.

711
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:19,401
Are you okay?

712
00:59:20,006 --> 00:59:21,405
Fine.

713
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:31,817
How is he? Still sedated.

714
00:59:31,853 --> 00:59:33,115
Sedated...

715
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:39,822
careful. Chemical treatment is
dangerous for him

716
00:59:39,896 --> 00:59:43,128
they know their jobs. Let them work.

717
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,067
You turn people into voodoo dolls.

718
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:48,171
No wonder they're bewitched.

719
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:51,175
"It's low blood pressure, that's all."

720
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,974
He was out for 10 minutes!

721
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:59,544
It's not serious. Tachycardia.

722
00:59:59,586 --> 01:00:02,987
- Did he have a trauma?
- We were drinking.

723
01:00:03,023 --> 01:00:04,651
Can you see him? One by one.

724
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:14,067
"When I got there, I was my normal self."

725
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:16,372
As normal as usual.

726
01:00:17,574 --> 01:00:21,272
Maybe the music was too loud.

727
01:00:23,814 --> 01:00:25,942
"Don't worry, son. I'm here."

728
01:00:31,624 --> 01:00:33,785
Coffee? No thanks.

729
01:00:38,365 --> 01:00:40,697
Are you still treating him?

730
01:00:40,734 --> 01:00:43,226
The treatment isn't over yet.

731
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,172
He may react to it unpredictably.

732
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:49,411
You don't know your power.

733
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,612
I'm out of line.

734
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:54,911
"He is very sensitive, but too hidden."

735
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:59,247
He's endearing. Not your average guy.

736
01:01:04,697 --> 01:01:07,131
I didn't want to wake you.

737
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:11,934
"I think he's better, so I'll come home."

738
01:01:14,442 --> 01:01:17,002
He needs sleep. I'll stay.

739
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:18,568
Can we say goodnight?

740
01:01:18,779 --> 01:01:20,372
It's best if you don't.

741
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:24,579
Tell him meet me tomorrow
in the cafe after work.

742
01:01:24,953 --> 01:01:26,888
See you around.

743
01:01:35,332 --> 01:01:37,699
Cold? A little.

744
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,363
You want my jacket?

745
01:01:41,172 --> 01:01:43,038
I'll walk you home.

746
01:01:44,377 --> 01:01:47,211
"1,850 francs."

747
01:01:47,581 --> 01:01:49,572
Thanks for your hospitality.

748
01:01:49,616 --> 01:01:51,880
We hope to have you back.

749
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,654
Was I a pain? Not at all.

750
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:03,197
"You were discreet, but very energetic."

751
01:02:03,365 --> 01:02:06,529
"Is he your friend? Yes, a friend."

752
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:10,236
Let's go.

753
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:31,662
Are you okay?

754
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:34,301
- Not too uncomfortable? - it's fine.

755
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:41,705
"-What's that smell?
- "Bad boy" by Molyneux."

756
01:02:41,745 --> 01:02:44,305
"Heady, but it scored me a few hits."

757
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:47,215
...in the dim and distant past.

758
01:02:50,655 --> 01:02:54,217
It's ages since I slept with someone.

759
01:02:58,131 --> 01:02:59,723
Were you ever married?

760
01:02:59,766 --> 01:03:01,063
Yes.

761
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,861
With a woman? You bet.

762
01:03:03,938 --> 01:03:06,168
A good woman. A dutiful wife.

763
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,707
We weren't madly in love.
We married late.

764
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,505
Dead? Guess again.

765
01:03:12,547 --> 01:03:16,848
She grows carrots down south.
She hated Paris.

766
01:03:17,086 --> 01:03:18,986
You never see her?

767
01:03:19,288 --> 01:03:21,655
Once a year. At most.

768
01:03:26,264 --> 01:03:31,202
"If it's nice this weekend,
...we'll go for spin."

769
01:03:32,071 --> 01:03:33,698
I know a nice place.

770
01:03:34,473 --> 01:03:36,408
The Rabette inn.

771
01:03:39,012 --> 01:03:41,242
I meant to tell you...

772
01:03:41,481 --> 01:03:42,380
what?

773
01:03:43,084 --> 01:03:44,745
Nothing. Sleep.

774
01:04:16,557 --> 01:04:17,854
Sleep well?

775
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:19,826
- No tachycardia? - I'm fine.

776
01:04:20,028 --> 01:04:21,427
Croissant?

777
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:24,295
Tell me what you'd like for tomorrow.
Sit down!

778
01:04:25,467 --> 01:04:28,561
A load of chinaware came in from Taiwan.

779
01:04:28,604 --> 01:04:30,664
We have to sort it all out.

780
01:04:30,707 --> 01:04:34,837
There's damage. Put price tags
on the cracks.

781
01:04:35,045 --> 01:04:36,673
Help yourself. No thanks.

782
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:38,543
You're not hungry?

783
01:04:38,783 --> 01:04:40,273
Biscuits?

784
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:42,313
I don't like them.

785
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:44,821
You're not an easy kid.

786
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:57,360
I should change my cabinets.
They're grim.

787
01:04:57,671 --> 01:05:01,164
I want them bright and peppy.
What do you think?

788
01:05:03,746 --> 01:05:05,145
Say something!

789
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,712
It's not all you should change.

790
01:05:11,088 --> 01:05:12,350
Thanks a lot!

791
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:18,819
- Wait. - I'm taking a ride.

792
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:20,228
There's no time.

793
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:21,732
I need to think.

794
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:25,734
Where are you going?

795
01:05:31,145 --> 01:05:32,976
You can't fool me!

796
01:05:37,352 --> 01:05:39,183
No ceramic teapots?

797
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:41,121
"Sorry, we're sold out."

798
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:45,920
We can't order any more!

799
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:47,955
Discontinued!

800
01:05:48,065 --> 01:05:51,125
It's hideous! Why litter
your living room?

801
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:52,499
Mr. Rene...

802
01:05:52,537 --> 01:05:55,301
I only have two arms! I'm all alone!

803
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:58,917
Have you seen Augustin?

804
01:08:59,157 --> 01:09:01,318
He missed tonight's lesson.

805
01:09:15,644 --> 01:09:17,612
Am I bothering you?

806
01:09:18,546 --> 01:09:19,980
May I?

807
01:09:25,389 --> 01:09:28,984
Here's your book on the tang dynasty.

808
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,725
Are you okay? You look...

809
01:09:32,997 --> 01:09:34,191
I'm fine.

810
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:41,471
Your weapons...

811
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:45,534
I should give it a try.

812
01:09:45,612 --> 01:09:47,478
Maybe not with you.

813
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:50,177
No. Not when we're friends.

814
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:51,809
Obviously.

815
01:09:52,754 --> 01:09:57,282
You must need a lot of intuition.
A special touch.

816
01:09:57,627 --> 01:10:00,494
Yes. It's difficult here.

817
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,164
"Different culture, different,"

818
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,829
"mixed-up, sometimes aggressive."

819
01:10:09,474 --> 01:10:12,170
You don't know many french people.

820
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,609
Yes. Two.

821
01:10:16,515 --> 01:10:22,284
"Discovering a new world,
when you're all alone..."

822
01:10:23,156 --> 01:10:25,352
I'm sorry I bothered you.

823
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:27,391
"No, stay."

824
01:10:46,450 --> 01:10:48,248
I'll get going.

825
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:56,460
Are you really okay?

826
01:12:26,469 --> 01:12:28,801
Got your passport?

827
01:12:28,872 --> 01:12:31,000
Here's your ticket.

828
01:12:31,075 --> 01:12:32,474
I'll pay you back.

829
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:36,743
Don't annoy me. It's my idea.
It's a present.

830
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:42,345
It'll do you good.
You need a change of scenery.

831
01:12:49,062 --> 01:12:52,521
I'll let you cope on your own.

832
01:12:52,567 --> 01:12:54,432
I'll be at the bar.

833
01:13:03,914 --> 01:13:06,576
How many bags? One.

834
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:08,117
My bike stays with me.

835
01:13:08,285 --> 01:13:09,617
I'm afraid not.

836
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:14,524
But the tyres are fragile.
They're patched all over.

837
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:18,292
What's the pressure in the hold?

838
01:13:19,097 --> 01:13:20,725
You must check it in.

839
01:13:21,601 --> 01:13:23,592
I could go with it!

840
01:13:24,637 --> 01:13:27,106
"Okay, I'll undo the wheels."

841
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:03,073
Hurry! You'll be late!

842
01:14:03,117 --> 01:14:05,881
The ticket's non-refundable. Hurry up!

843
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:11,192
"Send me a postcard. Anything!
The great wall,"

844
01:14:11,226 --> 01:14:14,788
"Mao's tomb, the yellow river
under ice..."

845
01:14:14,864 --> 01:14:16,695
go easy on the opium!

846
01:14:17,267 --> 01:14:19,702
"Hurry, or you'll miss the plane."

847
01:14:20,137 --> 01:14:23,834
Maybe they'll cast you
in a kung fu film.

848
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:31,013
"China, here I come."

849
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,745
Yes. See how you like it.

850
01:14:44,699 --> 01:14:47,260
"Sir! Your backpack, please."

851
01:15:02,086 --> 01:15:05,818
A few years later

852
01:15:30,921 --> 01:15:33,913
...interviewing Jean-Louis Boutinot

853
01:15:33,957 --> 01:15:35,288
how's business?

854
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:39,118
"...rice of the ricefields,
out this week."

855
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:40,863
"Mr. Boutinot,"

856
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:43,624
how much historical research

857
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:45,102
...went into the book?

858
01:15:45,304 --> 01:15:49,401
"A great deal of research, of course."

859
01:15:49,476 --> 01:15:54,210
"But in my view... primarily,
it's a novel."

860
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:00,210
I'm so fulfilled. A baby and a book!

861
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,555
Mrs. Wang! Hi.

862
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:08,326
"Hi, Mr. Rene. How's retirement?"

863
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:13,697
"I dreaded it, but not bad with a
little imagination."

864
01:16:13,738 --> 01:16:14,705
Excuse me.

865
01:16:14,739 --> 01:16:15,797
See you later.

866
01:16:39,535 --> 01:16:42,198
Hi. Thanks for coming.

867
01:16:42,272 --> 01:16:43,466
At long last.

868
01:16:45,208 --> 01:16:46,540
Your name?

869
01:16:48,078 --> 01:16:49,636
See you later.

870
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,979
Don't disappear. I'll sign you a copy.

871
01:16:55,053 --> 01:16:56,645
Your name?

872
01:17:11,139 --> 01:17:13,300
You're very elegant.

873
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:15,437
Where do you live now?

874
01:17:15,478 --> 01:17:18,470
"The 9th, near Clichy. I consult there."

875
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:20,272
Still wielding the needles?

876
01:17:20,317 --> 01:17:22,615
They can't do much harm.

877
01:17:24,755 --> 01:17:27,223
Are you married? Children?

878
01:17:27,258 --> 01:17:28,452
I'm married.

879
01:17:28,526 --> 01:17:31,155
Good. So you're happy?

880
01:17:32,030 --> 01:17:34,498
I like living in France.

881
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:40,539
I often think about...

882
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,042
have you heard from him?

883
01:19:12,449 --> 01:19:14,418
"-Hi there! - Hi, dad."

884
01:19:15,086 --> 01:19:18,146
Did you buy me chocolate? I did.

885
01:19:20,993 --> 01:19:22,927
Done your homework?

886
01:19:22,961 --> 01:19:24,053
I'll do it later.

887
01:19:28,134 --> 01:19:30,899
...not a crumb left on the table.

888
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,199
The wise man came and said.

889
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:37,006
Never mind. I'll eat the leftovers.

890
01:19:40,248 --> 01:19:42,376
In case you didn't notice.

891
01:19:42,451 --> 01:19:44,112
"...as you all eat so fast,"

892
01:19:44,186 --> 01:19:47,486
today we're eating soybeans
from Guangxi.

893
01:19:47,724 --> 01:19:50,090
They're good for the memory.

894
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:00,938
Your mother won't like it.

895
01:20:01,273 --> 01:20:03,139
Not until you finish.

896
01:20:03,543 --> 01:20:06,011
Not hungry. I want to go out.

897
01:20:06,046 --> 01:20:07,479
He's eaten a lot.

898
01:20:07,781 --> 01:20:10,307
Finish your homework first.

899
01:20:10,718 --> 01:20:13,016
I already did it.

00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,452
Hello.

2
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,742
<i> We're here with a woman who alleges

3
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,036
<i> to be my mother.

4
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,750
<i> I don't buy it for a minute.

5
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,670
<i> But this is how we'll find out.

6
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,628
I have proof.

7
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,421
<i>You have films.

8
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,465
<i>I have films and I have a certificate.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,010
<i>You have the films that I'm happy.

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,564
<i>Oh, yes. Well, because you doubted it for so long.

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
<i>You knew that I was gonna doubt it later,

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,480
<i> so you filmed me being happy.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,400
<i>No, I thought that if you filmed children,

14
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,189
<i> and you had happy children</i>
<i> and then you filmed it--

15
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,983
-<i> Exposure!</i>
- <i>Who knew when you were going to grow up

16
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,068
<i> and say, "I'm very unhappy,"</i>
<i> and "That's a fake film," that I made it up.

17
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,704
<i>This is getting so ugly so fast.

18
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,703
<i> You have to try to concentrate

19
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,405
<i> on the fact that you did have,</i>
 sometimes, good times.

20
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,207
<i>I know that I did!</i>
<i> I had a very good time.

21
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,001
<i>See how you yelled?

22
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,995
<i> At your mother?

23
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,127
<i>What about Todd?

24
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,514
<i> Do you like Todd better than me?

25
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,971
<i>No. It's just that you're different.

26
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,262
-<i> Every child </i>is different, so--
- <i>I don't buy this.

27
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,926
<i>You never bought anything that I said, so...

28
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,265
<i>Okay, what does he get in the will and what do I get?

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,731
<i>Oh, I'm not gonna tell anybody that.

30
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,066
<i>If we lived together, we would argue.

31
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,452
Yes.

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,240
<i> It's possible.

33
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,344
<i>How long has it been done for?

34
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,006
<i> I'm done for.

35
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,508
Ugh!

36
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,017
Fucking criminy!

37
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,140
I'm gonna go help my mother pack.

38
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,518
My mother is performing a show in Connecticut.

39
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,646
I tried to stop her,

40
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,363
but that is like throwing yourself in front of a...

41
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,526
Oh, what are those called?

42
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,365
<i> Not tiramisus.

43
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,200
Tsunami. See?
She's "Tsu-Mommy."

44
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,496
And I threw myself in front of Tsu-Mommy,
and it didn't work.

45
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,332
<i>She loves doing it when she's doing it,

46
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:16,128
but afterwards, she was laying on the floor, so...

47
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:20,183
But in a good, dignified, movie star way.

48
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,465
Mother and I live next door to each other,

49
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:30,386
separated by one daunting hill.

50
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,847
I usually come to her.

51
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,782
I always come to her.

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,910
Mommy!
Mommy, I'm home!

53
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,531
Hello!

54
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,497
Where--
look, you cannot keep that phone.

55
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,789
It's ridiculous.

56
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,713
<i>That's from the early '90s, when they first invented </i>cell phones.

57
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,803
- But I--
- That was one of the originals.

58
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,299
I don't want to buy a new one.

59
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,880
The old phone works fine.

60
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,676
Just dandy.

61
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,391
- It's horrible.
- Oh! There she is.

62
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,811
- Look. Look at all the--
- Do you know how to do it?

63
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,180
- Do you know how to do it?
- No. No one knows how to use those anymore.

64
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,558
That is a beautiful puff.

65
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,315
Thank you for the beautiful soufflÃ©.

66
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,979
- I love it.
- <i>Is it good?

67
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,533
You want to sing with me?

68
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,074
<i>Debbie, what do you wear in the show?

69
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,618
A very heavy beaded dress.

70
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,502
It is quite beautiful.

71
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,669
It's beautiful,
but it weighs more than she does.

72
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,499
It does weigh--

73
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,924
it does weigh about 50 pounds.

74
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,633
- But it's<i> so</i> beautiful.
- Worth it!

75
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Now, that's-- that's Elizabeth's.

76
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,263
This belonged to...

77
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,095
I bought that at Elizabeth Taylor's auction.

78
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,851
- I won it.
- This is when-- during her muumuu phase.

79
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,814
Yeah. Well, it's pretty, really.

80
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,524
Look.

81
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,114
It has a drag queen element.

82
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,530
Oh, now, just do what your mother says.
It makes life easier.

83
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,690
As if.

84
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,198
- Yeah.
- All right.

85
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,699
You remember me? I'm your mother.

86
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,661
- I remember.
-<i> Tammy, Tammy...

87
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,871
I keep you very close, so--
constant reminder.

88
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,703
<i>Is this for the show?

89
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,248
<i>I forgot I had it.

90
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,871
That's what's good about losing your memory

91
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,418
is there's so many surprises in the world.

92
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,172
I have found some things work.

93
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,215
Not enough.

94
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,798
There's never enough Listerine.

95
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,513
I'm gonna go fill it. I'm just gonna go fill it.

96
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,643
Remember, we had a relative that drank Listerine...

97
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,601
- She was an alcoholic.
- ...and 18 bottles of vanilla.

98
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,814
- Okay.
- That's it. That's all.

99
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,653
Okay, look.

100
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,228
Turn around this way because your rear end

101
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,113
is to the camera.

102
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,900
Oh, my God.

103
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,525
I don't like not knowing what's happening.

104
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,242
- I worry a little.
- <i>That's very sweet.

105
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,413
I worry what the show costs you.

106
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,122
That's all. I know you like to do it.

107
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,962
I have caught up with a few people in age.

108
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,618
Whoa!

109
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,247
<i>But they're in bed and you're doing a show.

110
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,594
<i> Like George Burns says,

111
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,260
I'm gonna stay on stage until I drop dead.

112
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,378
And then I'm gonna have myself stuffed,

113
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,005
like Trigger,

114
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,762
and then I'll put me in a museum.

115
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,144
-<i> That's nice.</i>
- Do you like that?

116
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,060
Or we could just leave this house...

117
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,769
<i>I totally understand why she's doing it,

118
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,310
<i> and it makes me nervous.

119
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,864
<i> She'll forget she's not 35.

120
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,479
You know, it doesn't make sense to her

121
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,647
that her body isn't cooperating.

122
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,027
<i> And she just thinks if she ignores it,

123
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,946
<i> it'll go away.

124
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:39,076
Everything in me
demands that my mother be as she always was,

125
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,376
even if that way is irritating.

126
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,591
She just can't change.

127
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,721
That's the rule.

128
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,218
And she's fucking with me.

129
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,841
<i> Age is--

130
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,678
<i> it's horrible for all of us,

131
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,894
but she falls from a greater height.

132
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,530
<i>Debbie's light goes to the ears.

133
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,939
-<i> Yes or no?</i>
- Yes.

134
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,067
<i>Okay. You know, all this stuff

135
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,494
<i> is, like, blocked in your template.

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
And I think I only got nervous once

137
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,083
when I performed for the Queen of England.

138
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,587
I went over with Bob Hope to do a show,

139
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,381
and I did get a little nervous there.

140
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:13,974
The crown, the jewels kind of threw me a little bit.

141
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,012
But as a rule, I don't--
I don't get nervous.

142
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,927
I just have a good time.

143
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,017
<i> I've been doing this my whole life.

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,313
<i> You know, I started performing when I was 16.

145
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,398
<i>Will you know your set already and everything?

146
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,283
<i>Oh, yes, I'm all set.

147
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
I carry my script in my beat-up folder.

148
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,583
You can see how beat up.

149
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:42,249
And all the edges are all worn out.

150
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,671
<i> And if you can make people smile a little,</i>
 laugh a little,

151
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,752
<i> just enjoy themselves for a moment...

152
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,418
It's not "Macbeth," you know.

153
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,927
How are you tonight?

154
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,509
You're such a nice, attractive audience.

155
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,104
Now, you don't mind if I come out, do you?

156
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,309
See, I like to visit with you.

157
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,638
Otherwise, I'm stuck up there.

158
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,603
I've seen my act. Good evening.

159
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,523
<i>I used to go out in the audience.

160
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,892
<i> I used to do that.

161
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,898
<i> I used to wear a girdle, too,

162
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,231
<i> and I don't do that anymore.

163
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,743
So, it's like the old days, in a way,

164
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,361
but I'm like the old days, so...

165
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,793
Can you do me a favor while you're down there?

166
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,999
Yeah?

167
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,249
- You see that toe?
- Uh-huh.

168
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,041
That has to come around.

169
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,285
That...

170
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,958
See that? It has to go to the--

171
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,417
- Underneath?
- Yeah.

172
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,006
Thank you.

173
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,724
I'm pulling
your leg, huh?

174
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,715
I have to do it. Thank you. Thank you.

175
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,938
Okay, Kevin is gonna do, like, an introductory thing.

176
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,349
Five minutes, yeah.

177
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,317
Yeah. So, when do you want him to start?

178
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,689
When?

179
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,895
But David's already asked me this.

180
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,775
Oh, he did? He didn't tell him, though.

181
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,533
- Now.
- Now.

182
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,115
Go!

183
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,495
Oh!

184
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,759
I look around and I see all you nice men.

185
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,510
You're very sweet. I'm sure you're nice.

186
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,341
It's just that if there's a nice guy around,

187
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,348
I'm not gonna find him.

188
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,641
-<i> You remember Eddie Fisher?</i>
- Yes.

189
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,484
Carrie told me, "Mommy, doesn't--

190
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,941
doesn't it start to look like Eddie's the good one?"

191
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,936
<i>After Eddie, I married again.

192
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,856
He was very rich, too. That was helpful.

193
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,156
I thought that was very nice.

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,580
<i> But then I found out, after we were married,

195
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,039
he was a gamble-oholic, and he lost all of his money.

196
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,712
<i> I should have married Burt Reynolds.

197
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,461
I wouldn't have to change my last name.

198
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,758
And we could share wigs.

199
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,298
<i> So, I thought, I'll bring along

200
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,888
some of my first movies.

201
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,984
<i> We had a lot of fun in those days.

202
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,526
Now, this is my one little hit.

203
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,328
It's called "Tammy."

204
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,331
Here we go.

205
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:35,552
Start over again.

206
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,339
Maybe something will come out.

207
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,223
People were loving it. That was so awesome.

208
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,766
Okay, we're going this way, though.

209
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,442
Great.

210
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,278
Good.

211
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,901
Okay.

212
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,358
And...

213
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,117
one more.

214
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,239
Okay.

215
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,405
Boom!

216
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,834
- <i>Debbie, that was amazing!</i>
- It wasn't easy.

217
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,373
<i>Debbie, that was...

218
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,246
<i>It is very frustrating for her,

219
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,843
<i> because inside, my mom is the same person.

220
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you for having me.

221
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,875
<i>And she doesn't want to retire.

222
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,545
<i> She does not want to retire.

223
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,973
You were great.

224
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:23,068
<i>Performing gives her life.

225
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:27,993
<i> It feeds her in a way that family cannot.

226
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,834
That's why I think it-- we've always been frustrating.

227
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,621
Because... it's not--

228
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,287
people aren't cooperative,
audiences are.

229
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,586
When you're her, they are.

230
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,093
Where are you? Come here. Come on.

231
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,425
Come on. Junie, don't you want to see the kid?

232
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,051
Come on, sing it for your old mother.

233
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:54,226
Besides, I have to retire soon.

234
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:58,559
<i>I had been singing in my mother's act </i>since I was about 13.

235
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:00,147
Would you sing my favorite for me?

236
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,771
It's for Junie and Jerry.

237
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,528
Don't say no.

238
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,740
Just sing right out.

239
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,030
Whoo!

240
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,414
<i>My mother wanted to be able to groom me

241
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,163
<i> for show business.

242
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:40,808
<i>The biggest thing I did that broke my mother's heart

243
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,067
<i> was not do a nightclub act.

244
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,279
<i>My mother would say, "Do drugs. 
Do whatever</i> you need to do.

245
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,906
<i> But why don't you sing?"

246
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,457
<i>That was my big rebellion.

247
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,966
<i>Carrie's daddy, Eddie, had a great voice, you know.

248
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,261
<i> Really beautiful voice.

249
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,555
I guess she doesn't want to be Eddie 
and she doesn't want to be Debbie.

250
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,020
She wants to be Carrie, so she'll do it her way.

251
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,962
I love that voice.

252
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,209
Isn't that a great voice?

253
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,252
I wish I had it.

254
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,842
Take a bow, take a bow, take a bow.

255
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,644
<i>Bravo! Bravo!

256
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,719
<i> Bravo!

257
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,644
That's not bad for a 15-year-old, is it?

258
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,871
<i>So, this is the compound.

259
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:23,213
<i> It was built by Robert Armstrong, </i>who was in "King Kong,"

260
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,961
<i> who said, "'Twas beauty killed the beast."

261
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,795
<i> I've lived in this for--  let me see--

262
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,671
<i> 20 years.

263
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,758
<i> This is the lobby.

264
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,393
This is where early mornings are spent

265
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,351
with people who drink coffee.

266
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,771
And there's a hummingbird nest.

267
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,311
Look how teeny.

268
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,105
<i> This is the bathroom.

269
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,479
It has, as a lot of bathrooms should,

270
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,277
a player piano in it.

271
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,241
This is Bette Davis when she lived here.

272
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,122
This is my suitcase, Robert.

273
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Oh.

274
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,789
Ugly children portraiture.

275
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,620
They did this thing in the last century

276
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,746
<i> where they dressed boys in girls' clothing.

277
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,956
<i> He looks like Ross Perot in red.

278
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,257
<i> Shia LaBeouf as a Dutch underage prostitute.

279
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,053
<i> And Richard Dreyfuss

280
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,676
<i> as a young girl wielding a rose.

281
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,684
<i> Richard likes that.

282
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,096
<i> Now, this just happens to be probably an unhappy woman

283
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,147
<i> that looks like Kevin Spacey.

284
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,612
They sold this on the Internet

285
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,403
as a Princess Leia sex doll.

286
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,241
Maybe this.

287
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,911
There's no way of accounting for it.

288
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,707
<i> My daughter, Billie.

289
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,581
<i> My brother and myself.

290
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,208
<i> And Billie.

291
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,995
<i> And my mother and Judy Garland.

292
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,168
And my friend, Charlie, at the dentist

293
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,427
with his mouth widely displayed.

294
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,683
<i> My house-- I love it.

295
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,814
<i> It's like scavenger hunting.

296
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,693
<i> And my mother--

297
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,439
there's part of it she kind of tolerates.

298
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,322
"Well, this is just Carrie's thing."

299
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,491
<i> This is the opposite of the house that</i> I grew up in.

300
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,116
<i> The house we lived in was very grand

301
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,293
<i> when I was growing up.

302
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,422
<i> It was marble and glass.

303
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,250
<i> Cold.

304
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,916
<i> And there was just too much air in it.

305
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,586
<i> Family-wise, we didn't grow up with each other,

306
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,096
<i> we grew up around each other.

307
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,929
<i> You know, like trees.

308
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,099
<i> My mother, she worked a lot.

309
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,356
<i> And then Harry, her husband at the time,

310
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,149
<i> he was the original fancy-man, rich guy.

311
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,777
<i> It was a prototype life.

312
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,993
<i> We were getting ready for a photoshoot

313
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,624
<i> all the time.

314
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,370
<i> And that's what Todd and I shared.

315
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,455
<i> Todd and I had a shared history</i> of weirdness.

316
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Yes?

317
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,564
Who is it?

318
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,358
- Come in.
- Hi! I just wanted to say hi.

319
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,691
She brought her chicken in. Speaking of science fiction.

320
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,027
- Hello.
- We've never met.

321
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,663
And this is Nugget.

322
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,239
He travels everywhere with her.

323
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,615
He goes everywhere with me 'cause he's my emotional wellness chicken.

324
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,124
And he's just--

325
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,615
We're gonna get him a service tag

326
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,957
so he can be a service chicken.

327
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,921
I have to drive everywhere currently...

328
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,422
- With a harness.
- ...because they won't let chickens fly.

329
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,384
What? Yeah.

330
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,974
- He's my boy.
- That's right.

331
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,179
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.

332
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,299
No, I was just telling the poster story.

333
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,926
In fact, I was telling her the only reason why we bought this house

334
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,723
was so I could hang my posters somewhere.

335
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,233
So, I decided I would tell a story on this wall.

336
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,400
My mother made this movie called "Singin' in the Rain," down there,

337
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,150
and that's an original "Singin' in the Rain" poster.

338
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,152
Then she went on to do "Tammy and the Bachelor,"

339
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,284
where she sings the song "Tammy."

340
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,201
Then she makes a movie with Frank Sinatra called "The Tender Trap."

341
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,412
And in this-- while she's making this movie,

342
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,332
Frank Sinatra says, "Now, Debbie, whatever you do,

343
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,252
do not marry a singer, whatever you do."

344
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,041
So, she goes right out and marries the singer, my dad, Eddie Fisher.

345
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,378
<i> Then my dad ran off with Elizabeth Taylor

346
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,804
<i> and became a producer on "Cleopatra."

347
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,474
Then my dad goes on and marries Liz,

348
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,853
and of course they make the movie "BUtterfield 8."

349
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,180
So, that's the story of my life

350
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,766
in a certain amount of posters.

351
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,232
<i>Do you know what's funny, is Debbie,

352
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,312
<i> when she first came in here, she went,

353
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,977
- "How can you allow this?"
- Right, too many Debbie posters.

354
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,647
"To many Debbie posters. Where's your stuff?" She's just so awesome.

355
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,316
And I was like, where else am I gonna put your stuff?

356
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,914
Or what else are we gonna do with it?

357
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,619
Sooner or later, it's got to get up on the wall.

358
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,909
Now, when I was younger, "2001: A Space Odyssey" came out

359
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,914
and I was very influenced by how amazing that movie was.

360
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,997
<i> And then, all of a sudden,</i> you know,

361
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,543
<i> Carrie does this little picture</i> called "Star Wars"

362
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,706
she thought was gonna be a B-movie.

363
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,375
I went to the screening with her over at Fox,

364
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,424
and she was hiding in the back with me

365
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,088
<i> 'cause she thought it was gonna be</i> a cheesy film.

366
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,076
<i>We are at a lap dance.

367
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
Come on, do it a little more.

368
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,161
In the front, the whole thing.

369
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,668
<i>A celebrity lap dance,

370
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,840
<i> which is where celebrities of all shapes and ages

371
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,920
<i> sign autographs for cash prizes.

372
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,757
<i> It's sort of like going to a strip club,

373
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:12,814
<i> except they don't stuff cash in your underwear.

374
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,640
<i> But that's kind of it.

375
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,016
It's Carrie Fisher, everybody!

376
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,984
Carrie! Carrie!

377
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,444
Hi there. How are you doing?

378
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,448
- Good to meet you.
- That is great.

379
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,870
We'll get a photo later.

380
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,029
- It's a pleasure to... "meat" you.
- Meet me.

381
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,498
- All right, thank you!
- Thank you so much.

382
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,039
Well, she's always been my favorite on "Star Wars" since I was a little kid.

383
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,044
I had a crush on her since I was, like, eight years old.

384
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,087
<i> So, I'd just like to see her, you know?

385
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,461
That's awesome!

386
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,428
That doesn't really look like me in a way.

387
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,219
- Show me where.
- Right up here.

388
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,473
There? How we go...

389
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,604
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.

390
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,060
- Nice and big.
- Yes, sir.

391
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,268
There you go. Thank you.

392
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,726
-<i> I really like </i>your overall look.
- Thank you.

393
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,607
<i>That goes without saying.

394
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,074
Thank you. I like your outfit on you.

395
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,735
- Thank you.
- No bra, though.

396
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,083
I'll remember that next time.

397
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,699
-<i> Hey there.</i>
- Hello.

398
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,156
<i>So, this is one of these things

399
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,116
<i> that we go to at least once a month.

400
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,958
<i> They're kind of a mini Comic-Con.

401
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,424
Carrie resisted these lap dances for years,

402
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,795
<i> but it's amazing!

403
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,684
You see these thousands of people that are behind me here?

404
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,853
Okay, so, they line up at 9:00 in the morning,

405
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,193
<i> they'll stay here until 9:00 at night

406
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:42,648
just to have two seconds with Carrie.

407
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,900
Yeah, actually, Liz and Matt, please.

408
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,532
- <i>Liz and Matt.
- Yes.

409
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,569
-<i> Pleasure to meet you.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

410
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,323
- Don't cry. Don't cry.
- Stop it, stop it.

411
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,950
- <i>It was--</i>
- <i>It probably won't sink in for a while.

412
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,695
She's, like, my idol.

413
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,207
- <i>Is she?
- Yeah.

414
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,038
<i>How come?

415
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,503
She just epitomizes a strong woman

416
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:07,455
who speaks her mind,

417
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,876
doesn't care what anybody else thinks.

418
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,926
And I wish I was more like that.

419
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,990
<i>All right, here we go!

420
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,161
<i>Let's go!

421
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,990
There you go.

422
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:44,000
<i>Here we go!

423
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,518
They love...

424
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,191
<i>They love you.

425
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,570
Yes. They love her, and I'm her custodian,

426
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,279
and I'm as close as you're gonna get.

427
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,654
<i>She's me and I'm her.

428
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,368
I mean, they talk to me like I'm Princess Leia

429
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,289
who happens to have had all these, you know,

430
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:20,998
difficult experiences to go through,

431
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,958
and that's like me fighting for the Force.

432
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:28,422
It's nice. They're nice.

433
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,047
Oh, something's unplugged. I can see it.

434
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,551
<i>I thought this case was top priority.

435
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,638
I was on three episodes of this show

436
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:44,694
where I played a very pivotal character for the lead character,

437
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:48,519
and so I've been to a lot of "Knight Rider" conventions.

438
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:52,026
And when I went there, I realized how much I loved this car,

439
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:54,489
<i> and I said, "I got to have it."

440
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,860
I think it's important that you, you know,

441
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,697
marry inside the entertainment race.

442
00:27:00,411 --> 00:27:02,291
And, you know, that's an important thing

443
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,830
because people don't get it.

444
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,124
I think you could-- my family, in particular,

445
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,918
could overwhelm most people.

446
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,263
<i>It wasn't just my mother that was super famous.

447
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,299
<i> People forget my dad was a world-class singer.

448
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,431
<i> He had more consecutive hits than the Beatles

449
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:22,263
<i> and Elvis Presley combined.

450
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,768
<i> At one time, he had 65,000 separate fan clubs.

451
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,485
<i>He had an exclusive contract with Coca Cola.

452
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,333
<i> He was the "Coke Kid."

453
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,039
...T.V.'s even more fun

454
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,199
with a bottle of Coke in hand.

455
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:48,537
They gave him a percentage of the Pasadena bottling company proceeds.

456
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,334
I mean, he had it made for life.

457
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,538
All he had to do was behave a little bit.

458
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,639
<i>My dad and mom, they were cute as hell together,

459
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,772
<i> and they had the cutest little kids </i>together,

460
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,850
<i> and they were the couple of America.

461
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,106
<i> Obviously, the studio loved that setup.

462
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,688
<i> You know, you put the two of them together,

463
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,533
<i> it's one heck of a marketing tool.

464
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,565
<i> I think my mother really was in love</i> with my father

465
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,315
<i> in a naive, young person way.

466
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,778
<i> First love.

467
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:26,578
<i> And I think that was the last time

468
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,542
<i> that she ever really experienced that.

469
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,674
- There.
- She's here?

470
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,014
Yeah, outside there.

471
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,509
Hey, Dwight!

472
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,346
Mama! Let's go that way, though.

473
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,180
You look beautiful.

474
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,690
You're wearing the same shoes as I am.

475
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,098
- No, you gave me these.
- I know.

476
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,858
- You don't remember?
- No, I do.

477
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,769
I leave messages.

478
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,568
I know, that's the greatest thing.

479
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,571
- I leave messages on here.
- I wish there was one.

480
00:29:00,614 --> 00:29:02,494
- "I'm here."
- "Go away."

481
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,243
"If you want to come in, come in through the front door."

482
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,905
"It's not a rainy day.

483
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,084
It's my day to be quiet and alone."

484
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,633
Alone is good.

485
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,590
<i> I have to go to my meeting now,

486
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,801

I love--  oh, oh, oh, oh.

489
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,886
- I love you.
- I don't know where you're going.

490
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,011
I'm coming up.

491
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,064
And look, our shoes are the same.

492
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,730
- Sing the song.
-  I don't want to go 

493
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,367
"I'll be around."

494
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,792
<i>I think I'm my mom's best friend

<i> of her wishes, an extension of her.

498
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,170
<i> And to a great degree,

far more sometimes than I ever would want to,

500

I know what my mother feels and wants.

501
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,438
And there's a lot of it.

502
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,229
I share everything with my daughter.

503
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:17,903
That's right.

504
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:20,442
Especially the check.

505
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,946
- Especially the what?
- Check.

506
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,818
She pays for everything.

507
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,615
Oh, that's-- it's not true.

508
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,080
She gets furious when I bring up...

509
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,661
That's me.

510
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,010

00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,050
I'm going to kill myself.

528
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,182
Don't say that even in jest, Suzanne.

529
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,640
<i>I was very unhappy back then.

530
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,892
I was just a mess.

531
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:39,694
And some of the things that are in the movie happened.

532
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,902
- Any idea what she's taken?
- <i>Pills, sir.

533
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,652
-<i> Demerol,</i>
<i> Percodan, and cocaine.</i>
- Give me her vitals.

534
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,735
Todd:
<i> Carrie at this point</i>
<i> was famously into drugs.

535
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,661
- Suzanne?!
- <i>And my mother was not real happy about it.

536
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:54,044
There was anger, true anger there.

537
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,909
I never said you were a monster.

538
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,076
You don't say it, but you feel it.

539
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,035
Somehow you lay the entire blame for your drug taking on me.

540
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,297
I do not! I do not, Mother.

541
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,090
I took the drugs. Nobody made me.

542
00:32:17,561 --> 00:32:19,191
<i>Carrie and I started getting high together

543
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:22,059
<i> when we were about-- I was 15.

544
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,897
<i> We used to smoke weed together </i>and we had a lot of fun.

545
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,404
<i> And then, you know, she moved on to other things,

546
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,278
<i> and I didn't.

547
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,913
<i> When I would stop, she would keep going.

548
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,792
<i>I knew something was the matter with me.

549
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,586
<i> I went too fast.

550
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,510
<i> I was too much.

551
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,588
<i> And I was embarrassed of it.

552
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,602
<i> The drugs I liked were painkillers.

553
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,600
<i> They calmed me down.

554
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,431
I just couldn't--

555
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,138
I couldn't handle it.

556
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,938
I didn't know what "it" was.

557
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,856
<i>Manic depressive is a disease.

558
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,784
<i> Now, that was not diagnosed then,

559
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,324
so nobody kind of knew what was going on with Carrie.

560
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,788
When she was 13, her personality changed.

561
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,123
<i> So it's a constant battle

562
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,666
<i> that takes all of us

563
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,000
<i> to assure her that she's loved,

564
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,586
and that won't get her.

565
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,085
Hard. Yeah, it's hard.

566
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,928
That's the hardest part.

567
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,560
It's Christmas here in China on the Wall,

568
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,524
and we're headed toward the top.

569
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,935
<i>Come with us.

570
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,153
<i> Join us on a walk on the Wall.

571
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,825
Come on, everybody!

572
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:19,512
We look like we're tired! We're having a ball!

573
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,731
<i>I have two moods.

574
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,573
<i> Roy is Rollicking Roy,

575
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,529
<i> a wild ride of a mood!

576
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,029
Wow, some of that methamphetamine released itself,

577
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,491
and the brain slid and there was some trapped

578
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,122
methamphetamine from my father.

579
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,539
It's melting from the heat.

580
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,180
<i>Pam is Sediment Pam,

581
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,938
<i> who stands on the shore and sobs.

582
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:10,611
<i> One mood is the meal,

583
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,901
<i> the next mood, the check.

584
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,406
Where am I in all this? I have no idea.

585
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,041
Because I feel like it's a little mood relay, you know?

586
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,749
I'm Pam now.

587
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,964
See, if Roy got this cold...

588
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,755
he wouldn't let him stop it.

589
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,756
'Cause Roy is bigger than all of it.

590
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,385
But I just fit snugly

591
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,601
into the mood pocket that is Pam.

592
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,983
I don't have any choice.

593
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,100
I don't dictate the ride.

594
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,586
Look, the blue one, I think, is probably better,

595
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,760
but this is crazier.

596
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,509
It's important to know.

597
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,511
<i>That is very nice sweater.

598
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,263
Those are good folk art colors.

599
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,506
That's what you are-- folk art.

600
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,557
Okay, see? That's not bad.

601
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,942
And a person wearing this would then have a room...

602
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,440
like this!

603
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,566
We met--

604
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:40,071
Debbie and Eddie bought a house

605
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,615
two doors down from where I lived.

606
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,288
I was 11 when they first moved in, I think.

607
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,499
She was pregnant with Todd.

608
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,909
- <i>Debbie worked a lot...</i>
- Yeah.

609
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,957
<i>...so she wasn't there, so, you know,

610
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,541
it's like you take what you can get, really.

611
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,996
And if you can't have Debbie Reynolds...

612
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,207
No, we wanted her.

613
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,339
<i>Here's the deal-- Carrie at two

614
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,637
<i> was more interesting than anyone I've ever known.

615
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:10,482
<i> Todd was a very happy child, very easygoing.

616
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,230
<i>But we weren't made with each other in mind.

617
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,904
<i>No, you were very different.

618
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,283
<i>I was jealous of that.

619
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,950
It was simpler for him for some reason.

620
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,699
Yeah.

621
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,951
Also, he didn't--

622
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,582
you suffered from the divorce.

623
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,949
You had an attachment to your dad,

624
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,956
<i> but he wasn't around much.

625
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,669
<i> And then Elizabeth Taylor--

626
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,460
<i>Oh, God.

627
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:40,716
<i>In a scandal that's gripping Hollywood</i> and the nation,

628
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,179
<i> Eddie Fisher leaves America's sweetheart,</i> Debbie Reynolds,

629
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:48,431
<i> for her friend and neighbor, Elizabeth Taylor.

630
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,175
<i>Something I had never seen was all the paparazzi.

631
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,977
Liz, over here!

632
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,606
<i>It was very dramatic.

633
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,243
I want to get out. Now.

634
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,990
<i>And your mom was quite dignified and quiet.

635
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,121
I haven't even been informed. I just got off the airplane.

636
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,705
I will not contest it, no.

637
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,166
<i>All of a sudden, there were photographers

638
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,295
<i> on your front yard or on the sidewalk.

639
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,972
<i>Don't remember it.

640
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,353
<i>Coming out of the driveway,

641
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,309
<i> they took your picture in the car.

642
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:32,309
<i>I don't remember it. I don't remember it.

643
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,142
- I don't want to remember it.
- Yeah.

644
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,347
No, I do remember it.

645
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,977
I'm sure that was very stressful.

646
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,024
I know I didn't like that.

647
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:44,277
They were trampling me and Todd to get to her,

648
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,992
so the sensation was that she belonged to them.

649
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:52,195
My mom did say about her-- she said, "That's a sad child,"

650
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,827
and that's after, I think, the divorce.

651
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,995
<i> She had this sadness,

652
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,674
and then Harry Karl was in the picture.

653
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,803
<i>We were supposed to call him "Daddy Harry."

654
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,010
Yeah, that was gonna happen.

655
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,675
<i> He was just a mass of noises and monograms.

656
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,892
<i>You have to remember this.

657
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,563
<i> There was an intercom, and he would start calling,

658
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,814
"Carri-i-e.

659
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,897
To-o-dd.

660
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,743
Hone-e-y."

661
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,699
"Honey" was Debbie's name.

662
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,330
<i>You know, he owned shoe stores, so that didn't interest us.

663
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,948
<i>Nothing about him was interesting

664
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,655
<i> until we found out about the hookers.

665
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,536
Oh, God.

666
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,923
And here he comes now,

667
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,539
industrialist and philanthropist,

668
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,746
a celebrity in his own right, Harry Karl.

669
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:45,047
- And look who's with him-- Carrie and Todd.

670
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,932
<i>Harry Karl walked into the perfect,</i> ready-made family,

671
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,099
<i> and he seems like a great setup.

672
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,968
- There's Mommy.
- There's Mommy, yeah.

673
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,556
<i>Loving, caring, loved Carrie and I,

674
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:59,192
<i> but we don't know at the time that he has serious problems.

675
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,191
<i> We don't know that</i>
<i> he is a compulsive gambler.

676
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:04,574
<i> We don't know that he's</i>
<i> a compulsive drinker.

677
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,781
<i> It was a disaster</i>
<i> in the making,

678
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:09,032
<i> and it was really a disaster</i>
<i> when my mom came home one day

679
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,034
<i> and saw</i>
<i> the foreclosure notice</i>
<i> on the front door

680
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:13,406
of one of the biggest houses
in Beverly Hills.

681
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:20,037
<i>At the end</i>
<i> of the rainbow 

682
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:34,257
<i>We were both about to enter a new era of reality.

683
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,177
<i> Little did we know what's really going on</i> at that exact moment

684
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:39,687
<i> is Harry Karl is gambling away</i> all of our money

685
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:43,019
<i> and Harry and Debbie were divorcing.

686
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,106
<i> That was the tail end of Carrie and I,

687
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,782
<i> our innocence as children.

688
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,738
- Okay, let's go.
- All right, let's go.

689
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,368
We're going to see Debbie.

690
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,471
<i> Ma?

691
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,931
<i>Aw, I'm so happy to see you.

692
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,563
<i> How are you?

693
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,680
<i>I'm good. How are you feeling?

694
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,637
<i>Shitty. Pretty bad.

695
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,478
<i>Truly, you look so beautiful.

696
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,486
<i> You have to believe me.

697
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,909
<i>I'm dizzy, and I think I caught it from you.

698
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,868
<i>Here, you want some oxygen?

699
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,199
<i>Yes! That's the ultimate hostess.

700
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,535
<i> You're offered water, soft drinks, oxygen.

701
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,753
- <i>Here.</i>
- <i>I'm taking it.

702
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,591
<i>Carrie, maybe you've had enough oxygen.

703
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,797
- <i>What?</i>
-<i> Maybe you've had enough.

704
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,478
She seems very, you know, coherent,

705
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,598
and she looks wonderful, but she seems fragile.

706
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,356
And, um...

707
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,108
She's good at seeming good.

708
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,650
- That's the thing.
- Yes, that's correct.

709
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,443
She's definitely the lightest version

710
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,568
of Debbie I've ever seen.

711
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,865
Um...

712
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,239
That would be a good way to put it.

713
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,945
Yeah, Debbie Light.

714
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,133
Holler "uncle"!

715
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,090
You're tuckered, Molly! Why don't you quit?!

716
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,764
Sure, I'm tuckered, and I might give out, but I won't give in!

717
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,755
How could anybody say I'm down?

718
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,597
Look, I'm blinking!

719
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,103
<i>Somehow, my mother is unsinkable.

720
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,515
- Maybe here!

721
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,444
<i>That "Unsinkable Molly Brown" stuff is her.

722
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,154
No place, but there come a time

723
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,025
'cause nothing nor nobody wants me down

724
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,823
like I wants me up!

725
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,906
<i>The idea that my mother is now older

726
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,042
and she's more frail, and I'm trying to see

727
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,949
what that feels like, but I still don't feel it

728
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,078
because she's still who she is inside.

729
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,633
<i>She went to school at MGM,

730
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,011
<i> where they trained you how to behave,

731
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,968
<i> and so it's in her consciousness

732
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,629
<i> to be at her best at all times.

733
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,468
Howdy, everybody.

734
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,264
Welcome.

735
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,808
Glad to see you're here at last.

736
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,062
And she's a fan before she was ever a star.

737
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,645
<i> When she went to MGM,

738
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,480
<i> she was enamored like anybody would be.

739
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,065
<i> My God, there's Clark Gable.

740
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,030
And I have pictures of her with Gary Cooper.

741
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,900
You can see she's got stars in her eyes.

742
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,817
<i> Who wouldn't?

743
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,406
<i> And she's still a fan to this day.

744
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,788
<i>But let me just say that Debbie Reynolds

745
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,581
is a self-proclaimed movie-oholic

746
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,745
and has an enormous Hollywood memorabilia collection.

747
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,256
Altogether, the costumes and props

748
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,169
are worth millions dollars,

749
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,467
so this is sort of your nest egg.

750
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,141
Yes, this is-- I put all the money I could save

751
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,811
after all my husbands, and I bought costumes.

752
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,231
This is Marilyn Monroe's subway dress.

753
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,140
Wow.

754
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,811
<i>My mother's passion for collecting

755
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,568
<i> started when they were auctioning off

756
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:17,110
<i> the back lots of MGM and all the contents.

757
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,195
<i> The idea that this stuff was going to be scattered

758
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,490
<i> to the four corners of the Earth

759
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,873
<i> was unconscionable to her,

760
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,291
<i> so she took it upon herself to say,</i> "I'm going to save it."

761
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:32,131
This is Liz Taylor's stool, makeup stool from "Cleopatra."

762
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,500
This chandelier back here is called a "girandole."

763
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:37,257
It's from "Marie Antoinette" and "Camille."

764
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,640
In the end, she was successful in amassing

765
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,098
the world's largest collection of Hollywood memorabilia,

766
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,219
<i> and so she wanted to build a museum.

767
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,387
- This is from "Molly Brown."
- That's right.

768
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,766
<i> People are always amazed when they come to Hollywood

769
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,814
<i> and there's no museum of film history.

770
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,317
<i>I've tried.

771
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,189
It's just that no one seems to be interested

772
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,146
that's in the business.

773
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,906
The public, the fans are interested, I'm interested.

774
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,699
We, for decades, struggled to build this museum.

775
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,833
It was impossible to believe that this wasn't gonna happen.

776
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,371
<i> But we couldn't find a partner who shared her vision.

777
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,167
<i> Deal after deal fell through.

778
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,500
- "The Wizard of Oz."
- "The Wizard of Oz."

779
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,785
That's Judy Garland's.

780
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,418
Chokes me up now.

781
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,554
You know, here we are-- we'll talk about this

782
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,631
in another 10 years, I'll get choked up.

783
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,007
Nobody wants to see their mother's heart broken,

784
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,144
and we saw it.

785
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,140
<i> When we had</i>
<i> the first two auctions,

786
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,854
<i> it was very traumatic for my mother.

787
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,145
<i> We sold the Marilyn Monroe subway dress

788
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:37,399
<i> from "The Seven Year Itch" for $6.2 million.

789
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:40,994
<i> The truth is the collection was sinking her financially.

790
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,370
We had debt because we had borrowed money to get a lot of this stuff,

791
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,369
<i> and we don't have a museum.

792
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,872
<i> We were done.

793
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:02,804
<i>In one week, I have to go

794
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,304
<i> and start rehearsals in London

795
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:09,016
for "Star Wars Seven...ty-two."

796
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:14,228
<i> I'm concerned because my mother</i> is not feeling well.

797
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,902
But I'm trying to let go.

798
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,571
It's like the--

799
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,320
It's like I should be trying to let go of my daughter

800
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,112
instead of trying to let go of my mom.

801
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,067
So, everything is backward.

802
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,267
<i>My question is, if you die when you're fat,

803
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,233
<i> are you a fat ghost?

804
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,323
Or do they go back to a flattering time?

805
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,900
So now you got to pick it up.

806
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,895
I'll go to 30, but then you have to let me go!

807
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,658
- Almost there!
- Let me go! Let my people go!

808
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,200
That's all you're gonna get.

809
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:12,084
Oh! Okay, now cool down. Keep it going.

810
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,581
Oh, I've been doing this for a year.

811
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:19,674
Lucasfilm, they make them report on my weight.

812
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,632
They take measurements.

813
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,884
I mean, it's-- it's intense.

814
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,677
- She loves it.
- I've learned to love it.

815
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,550
<i>I hate to break this conversation,

816
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,007
but the gift for George Lucas's daughter,

817
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,718
is it her birthday?

818
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,348
Oh, the gift.

819
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,436
<i> It's three months late for his birthday.

820
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,441
No, it's the birthday of the daughter, so--

821
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,443
-<i> No, it's his. It was his.</i>
- Oh, his birthday.

822
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,725
Okay, all right.

823
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,568
<i>All right, I found a place that wraps

824
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,993
<i>and does all the lovely things, </i>and I'll be back.

825
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,617
Forward and back.

826
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,253
Back. There you go.

827
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,710
Shoulders. Where are the shoulders?

828
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,959
California.

829
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,132
- We're going this way.
- Even if it's a lie.

830
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,261
No, there is no way-- no, that's the one thing--

831
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,680
that is my Waterloo.

832
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,299
After your exercise class,

833
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:15,097
what you need to do is smoke a cigarette.

834
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,143
You hear that noise, Carrie? That's what we have to do.

835
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,477
Clear the house.

836
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,984
He's bossy.

837
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,476
Don't clear it today. Clear it tomorrow.

838
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,938
Every day.

839
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,398
We keep trying.

840
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,869
Here we go.

841
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,290
<i>So, what's on the agenda?

842
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,371
<i>Let's go shopping.

843
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,837
Inner health and well-being you can now buy.

844
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:48,091
<i> How much is the little watch up there?

845
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:52,604
There's a man with his penis and a fat woman.

846
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,929
<i> "Prepare to meet thy God."

847
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,524
- Uh-oh. When?
- When?

848
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,190
Okay, and... action.

849
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,364
<i> Look at all this.

850
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:06,109
I'm having a crisis of joy.

851
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,074
Ooh!

852
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,663
What's nice here is the lighting.

853
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Ah!

854
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,914
They're doing a film.
Do you know who Debbie Reynolds is?

855
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,124
- Of course!
- She's my mother.

856
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,956
- Debbie Reynolds?
- Yeah, so--

857
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,461
- No.
- Yes.

858
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,423
<i> So, you know who Eddie Fisher is?

859
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,593
-<i> Of course I know Eddie--</i>
-<i> Okay, that's my father.

860
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,842
Oh, and I'm in "Star Wars." You know that movie?

861
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,125
Yes, of cour--

862
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,718
I'm Princess Leia. Yes! This.

863
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:37,894
Oh! I need a picture!

864
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,184
Well, you're getting a picture, look.

865
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,188
Look, they want--

866
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,480
Am I getting a picture with Princess L--

867
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,614
take one and then you can send it to me.

868
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,741
My son will go ballistic!

869
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:04,077
<i>So, was it good to see the "Star Wars" gang again?

870
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,997
Anybody you have history with, it's interesting

871
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,457
to see them after a while or not--

872
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,128
I've seen Harrison and Mark over the years.

873
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,587
You sort of run into one another in the cafeteria,

874
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,558
the celebrity cafeteria.

875
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,769
And they-- you know, we all just look more melted.

876
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,561
<i>Did you always want to be an actress?

877
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:28,515
No, I wasn't running around saying, "I want to be an actress."

878
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,858
You know, I think you got exactly the same eyes as your mother,

879
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:35,494
- and your chin's a little bit like hers, too.
- No, it isn't.

880
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,243
I only did "Shampoo" because I was hanging around the set,

881
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,866
and they-- you know, I mean, almost.

882
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,793
<i> I was a type.

883
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,003
<i> That was when Debbie wanted me to use the word "screw"

884
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,844
<i> instead of "fuck,"

885
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,920
<i> and Warren had to come over and convince her.

886
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,176
Can't we just, uh, be friends?

887
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,394
You want to fuck?

888
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,269
<i>And "Star Wars" came out when I was 20.

889
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,060
I met Paul the next year, and, boom.

890
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,237
<i>Suddenly, I'm with the people

891
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,449
<i> that are the best at what they do,

892
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,660
<i> the best actors and the best directors.

893
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,241
<i> And that was fun and scary to be around that.

894
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,157
It was all a surprise.

895
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,038
It all happened very fast and very soon.

896
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,877
<i>Carrie, someone's here!

897
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,963
Hey, fuckface!

898
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,428
- <i>Coming!</i>
- Where are you?!

899
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,157
- Oh, my God.
- Who the fuck is this?

900
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,409
Home at last. It's Gary, our son.

901
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,911
Where are we going?

902
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:05,123
We're going into the bedroom, as per usual.

903
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,624
So how's the new "Star Wars" going?

904
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,077
- I'm not allowed to answer that.
- Oh, that's right, you can't.

905
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,747
<i>Close your eyes.

906
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:17,174
- Can I open them?
- Yeah.

907
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,428
That's the only part of the "Happy Birthday" song

908
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,300
- that I've been able to learn.

909
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,137
That is what we sing now.

910
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,732
Oh, my God.

911
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,769
That is filthy.

912
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,483
Look it, that's his dick that's keeping the time.

913
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,984
-<i> As it can do.</i>
- It's a second-hand dick.

914
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,777
- <i>It's so beautiful.</i>
-<i> Isn't it great?

915
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,034
-<i> But I can really keep it?</i>
-<i> You can really keep it.

916
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,446
You know, I was thinking it's very funny

917
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,615
that we're running into each other in London, too,

918
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,584
because so many things happened to us here in London.

919
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,375
I remember you had a boyfriend and you were a virgin,

920
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,051
and you didn't want him to know you were a virgin.

921
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,010
So I helped you out
as a friend.

922
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,300
- He relieved me of the--
- The burden.

923
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,635
Burden of my...

924
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,021
- What is that called?
- Virginity.

925
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,598
- No, no, no, but-- hymen.
- Oh, the hymen.

926
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,354
I took the pressure off your hymen.

927
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,556
My hymen was a burden to me.

928
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,057
But that's what a real friend does.

929
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,608
- That really is.
- But it was funny.

930
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:21,072
They always say sex-- sex can ruin a friendship,

931
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,735
but we were young enough where it didn't.

932
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,954
- No, it was--
- I bet now it would.

933
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,535
No, it wouldn't. No.

934
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,461
Swear to God, my mother,

935
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:34,459
she offered for me to have sex with this guy Albert,

936
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,633
and she would supervise...

937
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,934
- Albert and I having sex.
- Actual having sex?

938
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,799
- Actual having sex.
- Walking you through it.

939
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:47,466
Yeah, because she apparently has some tips on that.

940
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,596
"You take the staff of life and the grapes."

941
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,806
Oh, God.

942
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,896
<i>For some reason, I have to tell you this.

943
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,902
The first time I saw test-- like, this is a tour

944
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,195
of the first times of genitals for me,

945
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,108
just endless tour.

946
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,737
Harry-- we all slept in the room with them,

947
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,365
and Harry slept in this top.

948
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,582
And he would go to the bathroom.

949
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,213
So, here we go.

950
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,330
- Now, we're all there.
- Oh, God.

951
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,288
Why?

952
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,927
-<i> Ugh.</i>
- And here comes Dumbo.

953
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,512
<i> I'm seeing the grapes, where they would be.

954
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:31,846
This angry slather of balls.

955
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,399
That is a horrible story.

956
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,689
<i>He was so awful.

957
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,783
Actually, Eddie turns out to be one of the better ones.

958
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,990
- Oh, my God, what a bar.
- I know.

959
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,950
You know, we can kind of laugh and everything,

960
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,031
but I remember you would look forward to seeing your father

961
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,287
or talk, and he would let you down, like,

962
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,000
over and over and over again.

963
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,381
And so, I always felt like, God, what a prick.

964
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,789
And I was so stupid about it, though.

965
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,588
Yes, you were. And you didn't see it coming.

966
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,012
You were an open-faced sandwich.

967
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,880
Like, "Yeah, I'm right here."

968
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,967
- There we go. There's a good title.
- And, bam!

969
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,893
"The Open-Faced Sandwich."

970
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,271
<i> But he suddenly did make more appearances.

971
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,438
He came and stayed with me. He came to me.

972
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,598
And he said, "I need, like,

973
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,268
$5,000, $10,000

974
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,317
for clothes."

975
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,821
I said, "I don't have it.

976
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:27,953
And he went, "You don't have it?!"

977
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,622
And he now points to my house.

978
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,451
"You don't have it?!"

979
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,457
And I said, "Dad...

980
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,420
...you're a singer, not an actor.

981
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,052
Don't make a scene."

982
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,708
At that time, he was kind of like

983
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,587
a guy who used to be famous,

984
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,683
a sort of washed-up, you know, um...

985
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,140
you know, lounge act.

986
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,430
It just makes me cringe

987
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,934
when you think about stars that aren't stars anymore.

988
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,517
- Yeah.
- It's humiliating.

989
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:01,154
<i>Todd, you said you could sing like your father.

990
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,322
<i>Oh, yeah.

991
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,564
<i>When Eddie left,

992
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,481
<i> I was, like, a year old.

993
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,850
One of the first times I really connected with my father

994
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,358
was after I shot myself in the leg in New York.

995
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,864
<i> It was the first time I had really heard from my dad.

996
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,784
<i> He never had called me before in my life.

997
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,663
<i> I was like, "Wow, that's unusual."

998
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,699
But, you know, I had to shoot myself in the leg

999
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,033
to get him to make me a call.

1000
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:57,118
I have not been

1001
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,504
the best father in the world.

1002
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,835
<i> I still have that guilt of not putting in

1003
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,970
<i> a certain amount of time that I thought I should have.

1004
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:12,798
<i> All I had in my head for years and years</i> and years was

1005
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:16,057
making sure that I had my drugs.

1006
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,191
<i>Well, my dad started off very early

1007
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,815
<i> with crystal meth.

1008
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,952
<i> It all started with him saying,

1009
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:32,109
<i> "God, I just can't do this show.</i> I'm so sick."

1010
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,028
<i> And this doctor was there, and he said,</i> "Look, I got a shot."

1011
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,946
<i> And he gave him this shot, and, man, he went out there

1012
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,485
<i> and sung his heart out.

1013
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,078
<i> And he was like, "That's incredible!"

1014
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,544
<i> He was being told it was vitamin shots.

1015
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,916
<i> That same doctor was giving it to President Kennedy

1016
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,343
<i> and to J. Edgar Hoover,

1017
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,171
<i> and a lot of very prominent people

1018
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,716
<i> were taking these same drugs

1019
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,509
<i> until everybody realized what it was.

1020
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,933
<i> But then it's too late, now, isn't it?

1021
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:59,268
People that get into drugs generally make stupid choices.

1022
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,520
<i> If you look at my dad's life, he got stuck on stupid

1023
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,653
<i> and ended up blowing his career.

1024
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,777
<i>Puff Daddy.

1025
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,369
<i> You want a beverage?

1026
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,212
<i>My father, the way that I had

1027
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,631
<i> a relationship with him, finally,

1028
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,499
was I became his parent,

1029
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,957
and that was the way to have the relationship.

1030
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,218
It's very important.

1031
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,719
<i>And so I got to know him

1032
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,601
<i> as there was less of him to know.

1033
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,309
Was I always funny?

1034
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,807
You know what?

1035
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,692
I used to be funny for you.

1036
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,480
'Cause I thought if I was really funny

1037
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,074
that you would want to be around me all the time.

1038
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:55,531
I would make myself wonderful for your return.

1039
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,824
See? And it finally paid off.

1040
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,540
<i>I wanted to be your best girl,

1041
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:08,134
and that's-- I had tough competition.

1042
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,455
Yeah. Well, you know, if your competition

1043
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:17,298
to be best girl with you is Elizabeth Taylor,

1044
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:20,006
well, I don't think I'm gonna do well with that one.

1045
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:25,267
But I think I'm funnier than Elizabeth Taylor.

1046
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,522
Anyway, that's always been a goal.

1047
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,402
You love me?

1048
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,990
I love you.

1049
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,371
You're loveable.

1050
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,898
<i>So, here we are, approaching the third auction

1051
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,944
<i> of my mother's collection.

1052
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,568
<i> Unfortunately, my mother just fell

1053
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,655
<i> because she was dizzy walking into her bathroom.

1054
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,042
When we saw her, we were all in horror

1055
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,078
because we were like, "Wait a minute.

1056
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,662
You know, you could have broke your neck or be dead right now."

1057
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,498
I fainted.

1058
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,343
I went plummeting to the ground.

1059
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,629
And I hit a rock or-- you know, in my bathroom.

1060
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,884
And it was 12:00 at night,

1061
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,136
and it just bruised everything.

1062
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,720
But-- I know, I'll do the interview like this!

1063
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,733
<i>But the subject never came up

1064
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,390
<i> to cancel the auction.

1065
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,518
<i> You know, I suspect she's going to show up

1066
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,395
<i> to the parties and act like

1067
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,742
nothing's wrong, which is what she does so well.

1068
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,489
Here we are.

1069
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,450
Here we are, here we are.

1070
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,741
Oh, this is murder.

1071
01:01:01,784 --> 01:01:04,584
You ready to come up? I've got your arm.

1072
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,700
- Good evening!
- I'm Princess Leia's mother.

1073
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:11,334
I'm wondering now, you're about to be done with the third--

1074
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,667
Final. It's the end of an era,

1075
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:17,342
but we hope that the public enjoy all these fabulous things.

1076
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:18,843
What is it about show business

1077
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,724
<i>that connects the two of you

1078
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:22,721
when you're not on a red carpet?

1079
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,973
We are always on a red carpet.

1080
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:28,595
We have red carpets at home, connecting our homes.

1081
01:01:28,644 --> 01:01:31,144
We are not people with personas.

1082
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,648
This is everything that came out of my mother,

1083
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,110
right here, these two.

1084
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,030
- Ugh.
- That doesn't sound good.

1085
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:38,689
That doesn't sound very good.

1086
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,777
<i> Well, it's a good thing.

1087
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,663
<i>I'll ask one more question.

1088
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,029
<i>Sold.

1089
01:01:45,077 --> 01:01:49,537
475 to paddle number 1073.

1090
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,671
My mom, she's having second thoughts

1091
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,289
about the Rat Pack costumes.

1092
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:57,626
<i> She said, "I think I want to keep them."

1093
01:01:57,673 --> 01:01:59,883
<i> She personally collected these outfits.

1094
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,005
Debbie went to Peter Lawford.

1095
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,932
And he was like, "Why in the hell do you want

1096
01:02:03,971 --> 01:02:05,761
my underwear and socks
and my outfit?"

1097
01:02:05,806 --> 01:02:07,556
<i> And she's like, "I want the whole ensemble,

1098
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,559
<i> and I want it for the museum.

1099
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,191
<i>I had a dream last night.

1100
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,599
I say it's a vision.

1101
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,107
I say it's someone speaking to me,

1102
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:21,401
that I should not sell the boys.

1103
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,580
<i>When I worked with Frank, he called me "sweetie."

1104
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,746
<i> "Come on, sweetie, sit over here."

1105
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,045
So, I don't want to sell,

1106
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,719
and I have to be here

1107
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:43,838
and I have to be happy about it,

1108
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:47,426
so I have to have happy things in my head.

1109
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,137
<i> I love having my ghosts

1110
01:02:51,185 --> 01:02:53,845
<i> and I love having my memories.

1111
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:57,396
<i> It's like you have a friend forever.

1112
01:02:57,441 --> 01:03:02,491
It makes me smile when I even just say their names.

1113
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:06,069
<i>Sold, 650 to paddle 6000.

1114
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,986
<i> At the time, the Hollywood Heritage Museum

1115
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:10,325
did not have the funds or the property

1116
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,450
of the Hollywood current museum

1117
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:14,748
as it says in the catalogue,

1118
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,501
so, with that in mind,

1119
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:17,923
<i> we're going to sell lot number 235.

1120
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,381
<i> Opening bid?

1121
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:23,131
<i> 20,000. Joe has the bid</i> at 20,000.

1122
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:25,005
<i> 20,000, the opening bid.

1123
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,682
$22,500.

1124
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,760
Is that a bid, sir? Or are you just-- yep.

1125
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,055
<i> 25,000. Thank you.

1126
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:31,348
<i> 25,000.

1127
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,101
<i> Gentleman on the aisle at 25,000

1128
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,734
<i> for the Charlie Chaplin--

1129
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:38,151
- <i>27,500.</i>
- 27,500.

1130
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,730
<i> Next would be 30,000.

1131
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,145
<i> Going once, going twice,

1132
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,494
<i> selling for $27,500.

1133
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,461
The dog will not leave,

1134
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,804
so do you want him to lie down?

1135
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,839
<i>Um, he's okay there.

1136
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,843
But I'm gonna sort of face that way a little bit.

1137
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,966
'Cause I just-- I look so bad.

1138
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,763
I don't want to face direct.

1139
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,767
<i>No, you're gonna talk to me...

1140
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,059
- Oh, good, good.
- ...but I was gonna stand right here.

1141
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,693
Now...

1142
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:21,109
is the hair in one place?

1143
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,149
- <i>The hair?</i>
- It's one place.

1144
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,943
Okay, there we are.

1145
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,857
<i>The hair looks very good.

1146
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,065
<i> Okay, how are you-- by the way, how are</i> you doing?

1147
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:32,736
Well, it's not my best day, but that's all right

1148
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,996
because we've had other days that are worse.

1149
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,158
Have we?

1150
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,116
I'm happy to be here.

1151
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,076
<i> First thing I want to ask you about

1152
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,207
<i> is how many years were you under contract at MGM?

1153
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:48,174
I was at MGM from 1948...

1154
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,548
through "How the West Was Won."

1155
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,966
We made a lot of pictures at MGM,

1156
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:54,555
and I had a wonderful time.

1157
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,850
I had a wonderful time.

1158
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,062
I had... youth, you know.

1159
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,023
I had-- I was just a kid.

1160
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,734
I didn't know anything,

1161
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,774
and they taught me everything.

1162
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,238
<i> Can we talk a little bit about your brother

1163
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,570
<i> and just a little bit about Texas?

1164
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,236
-<i> Because, um...</i>
- If you like.

1165
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,244
-<i> Is that okay?</i>
- Sure.

1166
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,485
<i> Oh, hi, Carrie!

1167
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,287
<i>You're going?

1168
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,674
<i>I'm going.

1169
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,710
Go to bed.

1170
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,463
Yes, go to bed.

1171
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,174
<i> Say good night to everybody.

1172
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,304
Good night to everybody.

1173
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:30,132
<i>Will you come back and visit us?

1174
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,837
<i>No, no, no. She's got to go to bed.

1175
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,555
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1176
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,522
The alarm! She's locked in now!

1177
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,945
Wait, Carrie!

1178
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,410
I have no idea what the alarm is.

1179
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,241
<i>Oh, my God.

1180
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:01,538
I-I have no--  I have no idea...

1181
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,873
Oh, my God.

1182
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,918
Now the police with come?

1183
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,251
I suppose.

1184
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,456
Michael?

1185
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:11,926
Try 985-3193 or something.

1186
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,428
I don't remember ever...

1187
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:19,642
I don't remember ever, ever turning this alarm on.

1188
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,982
It wasn't my day.

1189
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,895
That's it!

1190
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:33,817
-<i> Yay!</i>
- Ohh!

1191
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:39,122
<i>Debbie, while you're here,

1192
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,412
<i> can you just tell us about the shoes and stuff?

1193
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,667
Okay.

1194
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,629
<i> This is Judy Garland's shoe.

1195
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:50,129
Well, was, of course.

1196
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,013
They look small, don't they?

1197
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,760
Mm-hmm.

1198
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,142
They would fit me.

1199
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,178
<i> Do you think they fit you now?

1200
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,601
She wore 5 1/2.

1201
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,021
<i>I'll get that for you.

1202
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:02,929
- Sorry.
- <i>Okay.

1203
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,938
I think we should end it at the end of this.

1204
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,560
<i>Okay, yeah.

1205
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,606
'Cause I think everything's going wrong.

1206
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,281
Okay.

1207
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,609
And this...

1208
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,235
is...

1209
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,252
Thank you. Thank you.

1210
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,540
Thank you.

1211
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:27,171
Thank you.

1212
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,966
Chaplin.

1213
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:40,967
Come on.

1214
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:41,926
Come on.

1215
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,265
<i>Thanks, Debbie.

1216
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,520
- Come on.
- <i>You got it?

1217
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,851
<i>Mm-hmm.

1218
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,069
Dwight!

1219
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,367
Do you want to go to Vegas?

1220
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,951
I know Dwight does.

1221
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,366
Dwight always wants to go to Vegas.

1222
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,996
And they get very excited.

1223
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:10,043
Come on, it's hard to take both of them.

1224
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,206
<i> Come on, Dwig.

1225
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:16,047
<i>We are going to do Vegas

1226
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,682
with my mother.

1227
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:21,049
I didn't know it until my daughter told me.

1228
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,597
<i> It's absurd.

1229
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,351
<i> If you're going to retire, you retire.

1230
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,442
She retires and books an engagement in Vegas,

1231
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,439
and then says, "Come help me."

1232
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,191
I don't believe that that's the last one.

1233
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,782
<i>This is all against

1234
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:39,953
doctor's orders, now,

1235
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,541
as if any orders apply to Debbie.

1236
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:48,748
But everyone ends up in Vegas.

1237
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,918
<i> You know, if my mother's unhappy,

1238
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,633
it lives on my grid,

1239
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:57,423
so I both want to

1240
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,087
and have to help my mother.

1241
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,769
<i> She was very good to her mother,

1242
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,769
and her mother didn't deserve it.

1243
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:10,731
Debbie deserves it.

1244
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,694
<i>When Debbie got into show business,

1245
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,566
<i> obviously it was a big difference</i> in your lives,

1246
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,243
<i> but did you like it?

1247
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:22,782
<i>Mm-mm. I think it's phony.

1248
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,656
Your mother never knew what it was,

1249
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,584
and we went in blind.

1250
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,412
And did you encourage her to go in?

1251
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:32,747
No. In fact, I've tried to get her out of it.

1252
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,044
What did Grandpa think of show business?

1253
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,458
<i> Eh, he thought it was a crazy way</i> to make a living.

1254
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:41,344
<i>Well, what do you wish that she would have done?

1255
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,096
<i> She wanted to be a gym teacher.</i> You know that.

1256
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,389
<i>You think she would have been happier doing that?

1257
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,523
<i> I think it would have been more normal.

1258
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,140
<i> But she loves what she's doing,</i> let's face it.

1259
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,017
<i> Loved it all, and still does.

1260
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,774
- <i>Yeah, she does.</i>
- Yeah.

1261
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,896
God gave her brains, but He didn't put 'em up here,

1262
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,363
He put 'em down in her ankles.

1263
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:11,463
This is the view of the whole-- this is Vegas.

1264
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:15,748
<i> I've been coming here since the '60s,

1265
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,335
<i> but this will be probably the finale.

1266
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,632
I'm not feeling that well,

1267
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:26,846
and so, to be well enough to do my whole show,

1268
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:32,190
I asked my children if they would come up and relieve me.

1269
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,984
<i>"Carrie says, 'Mother,

1270
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,404
<i> you know I started in your act

1271
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,153
at 14 years of age."

1272
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,685
Who talks like that?

1273
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:45,778
"Todd comes onstage and the family banters."

1274
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,445
I don't want to make fun of it,

1275
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,744
'cause it's sweet and she wrote this.

1276
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:53,288
Then she sings "This is a Lovely Way to Spend an Evening"

1277
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:54,713
and "Tammy."

1278
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:59,048
<i> I hope it works out well.

1279
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:03,589
And the song that she's picked, for me-- perfect.

1280
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:46,181
<i>The only way you make it through life is to fight.

1281
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,299
<i> You don't get there the easy way.

1282
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,509
<i> If you feel sorry for yourself

1283
01:11:51,558 --> 01:11:53,308
<i> and you let yourself go down

1284
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,931
<i> you will drown.

1285
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:02,777
<i>Why don't we get you out of there--

1286
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,529
Just-- see that doorway down there?

1287
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:05,951
No, I know where to park it.

1288
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,659
- Okay.
- How about we walk you...

1289
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:09,159
- ...and then we'll...
- Well, first I want to--

1290
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,490
I'll take care of your cart.

1291
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:13,075
- Okay.
- She goes out the opposite.

1292
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:14,701
- Well.
- I was trying to get you out the easy--

1293
01:12:14,748 --> 01:12:16,618
I know. I saw where you were going.

1294
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,206
I was trying to get the stuff.

1295
01:12:18,251 --> 01:12:20,331
- I'll take care of this.
- I've got it.

1296
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,088
- All right.
- Thank you.

1297
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:32,807
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1298
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,969
Here's Debbie!

1299
01:12:43,568 --> 01:12:45,898
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1300
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:48,605
Welcome to the South Point Hotel.

1301
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:50,066
I look what?

1302
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:51,316
- <i>Good!</i>
- Oh, thank-- oh!

1303
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,407
<i>Beautiful.

1304
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,082
She says I look all right.

1305
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,830
<i>Do I look all right back there?

1306
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,286
Down here, I look like a hooker.

1307
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:08,174
This is it, you know. You folks came at the right time.

1308
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:11,258
This is my last weekend ever to be in show business.

1309
01:13:11,304 --> 01:13:12,474
- I'm gonna be...
- Aww.

1310
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:13,934
I've got to retire.

1311
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,563
Come on, say-- wish me luck.

1312
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,890
Yeah, "Good luck, Debbie! Yeah."

1313
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:50,419
<i>I enjoyed making that--

1314
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:53,678
- <i>I'll never say no...</i>
- Uh-oh.

1315
01:13:53,721 --> 01:13:55,431
To you

1316
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:56,933
You know my daughter.

1317
01:13:56,975 --> 01:14:00,975
<i>Whatever you say I'll do

1318
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:02,230
<i>If you ask me to wait...

1319
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:04,062
Carrie Fisher.

1320
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,767
...for a lifetime

1321
01:14:06,818 --> 01:14:09,688
You know I'll gladly wait

1322
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:14,657
For a lifetime or two

1323
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:17,581
<i>Just to look at you...

1324
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,790
Ah!

1325
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,120
I'll smile

1326
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:25,246
If you say be glad

1327
01:14:25,295 --> 01:14:26,875
I'll weep

1328
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:30,011
'Cause I'm bipolar...

1329
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:35,137
Today is tomorrow

1330
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,390
If you do too much blow...

1331
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:41,773
<i>I'll stay

1332
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:46,771
Or I'll go

1333
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:49,566
But I'll

1334
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:53,401
Never say

1335
01:14:53,448 --> 01:14:56,908
No.

1336
01:14:58,161 --> 01:14:59,951
<i>My daughter.

1337
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:13,625
Nice to see you.

1338
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:14,796
<i>Oh, likewise.

1339
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,562
- Please don't retire.
- Oh, no, it's time.

1340
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,469
- So beautiful.
- I love you.

1341
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,557
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1342
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:25,273
Great show.

1343
01:15:25,313 --> 01:15:27,863
Thank you.
Hi. How are you doing?

1344
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,819
Bye-bye.
Good night.

1345
01:15:43,248 --> 01:15:44,618
Hi, Alexis.

1346
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:46,286
<i> This is Donald calling for Debbie.

1347
01:15:46,334 --> 01:15:48,634
<i> She's not gonna be able to do that tomorrow.

1348
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:49,960
<i> I'm gonna put her on

1349
01:15:50,004 --> 01:15:51,674
<i> so you can hear how her voice is.

1350
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,304
<i> Hold on one second.

1351
01:15:55,093 --> 01:15:56,593
Okay.

1352
01:15:56,636 --> 01:15:58,336
-<i> She's not there?</i>
- No.

1353
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,388
<i> Hello, Alexis?

1354
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,351
<i> This is Debbie.

1355
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:05,062
<i> If I can't speak,

1356
01:16:05,103 --> 01:16:10,113
<i> I don't know a reason to try to do a recording.

1357
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:15,279
<i> Why don't we just forget about this till I'm well?

1358
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:17,661
<i> I'm sorry to bother you with it.

1359
01:16:17,699 --> 01:16:20,279
<i> Sorry to bother the both of us.

1360
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:24,156
<i> Anyway, Carrie says I should stop saying that.

1361
01:16:24,205 --> 01:16:26,285
<i> I'm sorry.

1362
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,002
<i> But I am sorry. Bye.

1363
01:16:36,134 --> 01:16:39,474
<i>So, just when we thought she'd stay home for a while,

1364
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:42,852
<i> my mom gets this big lifetime achievement award,

1365
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,930
<i> and she's right there back in the spotlight.

1366
01:16:45,977 --> 01:16:48,307
<i>Actress Debbie Reynolds will be the recipient

1367
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:52,114
<i> of this year's Screen Actors Guild</i> Lifetime Achievement Award.

1368
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,110
<i> The ceremony will be broadcast live

1369
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:57,652
<i> from the Shrine Auditorium in Hollywood, California.

1370
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:00,407
She was already making up speeches in her head.

1371
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:02,736
You know, she's like...

1372
01:17:04,329 --> 01:17:06,079
Her thing is sort of like, "Well, I'm--

1373
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,252
finally, they're..."

1374
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,871
But she doesn't say that.

1375
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,537
But they haven't been--

1376
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:15,377
they haven't lavished her with awards.

1377
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,256
Yep, you sit at your seat, just next to your mom here.

1378
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:24,314
That would be terrific.

1379
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:25,599
Here we go.

1380
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,774
<i>Debbie Reynolds, Lifetime Achievement Award.

1381
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,943
<i> Debbie Reynolds, Lifetime Achievement Award.

1382
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:36,192
<i> Carrie Fisher, standing in for Debbie Reynolds.

1383
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:42,198
Todd, I-- Todd, I stayed overnight.

1384
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,121
I was-- yeah.

1385
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,740
She doesn't feel well.

1386
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:48,247
She feels like shit.

1387
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,079
Then let's do that.

1388
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:54,594
Let's let her not be there at the table, and lay down...

1389
01:17:56,255 --> 01:17:59,375
That doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.

1390
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,425
I'll find out, but it doesn't matter.

1391
01:18:01,469 --> 01:18:04,349
Oh, how much time would she have to sit at the table?

1392
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,892
We're gonna need some kind of place for her to lay down.

1393
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:12,727
Yeah. Sure.

1394
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:15,192
<i>Okay, so if there's just, like, anything

1395
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,863
that's not embarrassing.

1396
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,321
<i>We'll make an area for her.

1397
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,072
Got it. We'll-- we'll--

1398
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:24,696
- we can make this work.
- She's like...

1399
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:26,122
Yeah.
It's okay, Carrie.

1400
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,370
We can make this work. We've done it before.

1401
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,050
They're gonna set aside, like a little area for her...

1402
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:49,138
so she can do it, you know.

1403
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:55,024
I know.

1404
01:18:56,858 --> 01:18:58,818
Give Debbie my best, all right?

1405
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,855
<i>Hi, Mama.

1406
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:09,034
I passionately, passionately

1407
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,578
am going to marry you while you're sleeping tonight.

1408
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:19,714
And by the morning, I will have taken all your money.

1409
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:25,842
No, I want your bedroom cleared.

1410
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:31,559
Except for me because I'm your favorite!

1411
01:19:34,729 --> 01:19:36,189
<i> Oh.

1412
01:19:38,316 --> 01:19:40,856
I'm sorry. God damn it.

1413
01:19:40,902 --> 01:19:42,192
I know.

1414
01:19:43,321 --> 01:19:44,821
Well, please, could--

1415
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:48,454
is there any way you could go to sleep...

1416
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:49,743
now?

1417
01:19:52,872 --> 01:19:54,752
Okay, I'll get off the phone with you.

1418
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,920
I'm-- I'm coming home.

1419
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:18,397
<i>I like Christmas.

1420
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:22,232
<i> I like the lights.

1421
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:24,779
<i> My mom...

1422
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,318
<i> she</i> is<i> Christmas.

1423
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:30,316
<i> She's something special.

1424
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:36,584
- Wait, did you get drinks?
- Yeah, perfect.

1425
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:39,464
Seriously, though, you secretly want something.

1426
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,832
I know you do.

1427
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:46,762
<i>You know, I could do a pretty good Streisand.

1428
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,161
Your voice is beautiful.

1429
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:17,445
Thank you.

1430
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:19,958
Um...

1431
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:23,461
I should have been a pair of ragged claws

1432
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:26,964
scuttling across the floors of silent seas!

1433
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:30,431
<i> You know what would be so cool?

1434
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:35,469
To get to the end of my personality...

1435
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,386
and just, like, lay in the sun.

1436
01:21:39,437 --> 01:21:42,397
Oh, I have to watch a little of this.

1437
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,190
I'm sick of myself.

1438
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,443
Smile.

1439
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,326
<i>I love this movie.

1440
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:56,288
<i> I love every lyric.

1441
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,995
<i>Are you okay, Carrie?

1442
01:22:02,043 --> 01:22:04,843
Mmm.

1443
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:06,749
That's how I've gotten through a lot of it...

1444
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:09,257
- is abstract it...
- <i>Mm-hmm.

1445
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,470
...so that it's not happening to me.

1446
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,222
It's...

1447
01:22:21,062 --> 01:22:23,812
I just-- I'm a, um...

1448
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:27,016
type of bird.

1449
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:37,077
I'm manic right now. I didn't know if you've...

1450
01:22:39,038 --> 01:22:42,368
And I haven't been for a while.

1451
01:22:46,712 --> 01:22:49,302
It'll go out of style soon,

1452
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:51,550
and then I'll just be quirky.

1453
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:57,508
<i>Ohh!

1454
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:59,386
Careful, all right?

1455
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:08,321
I make my own blends.

1456
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:10,529
Okay, you just kind of...

1457
01:23:12,947 --> 01:23:15,277
- Fun tonight.
- It's more than fun.

1458
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:16,664
It's-- it's magical,

1459
01:23:16,701 --> 01:23:19,911
and things will start happening now

1460
01:23:19,954 --> 01:23:21,914
<i> that you</i> want<i> to have happen.

1461
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,578
You are fucking amazing.

1462
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,665
I'm fuckin' amazing!

1463
01:23:34,802 --> 01:23:36,052
<i>I know.

1464
01:23:36,095 --> 01:23:38,045
Yeah, later, because they...

1465
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:42,468
<i>I know...

1466
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:46,056
Is she moving at all?

1467
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:48,935
Todd, you've got to get her out.

1468
01:23:48,983 --> 01:23:51,193
You can't push her or you don't get nothin'.

1469
01:23:51,235 --> 01:23:55,065
If you push, and then she gets mad, you can't have that.

1470
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,614
That's the worst thing that could happen,

1471
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:58,157
so you've gotta just kind of act like...

1472
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,701
The show has started.

1473
01:24:03,414 --> 01:24:06,544
And I'd like to accept this award on behalf

1474
01:24:06,584 --> 01:24:08,884
of every dog on Earth.

1475
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,918
Jodie Hattaway!

1476
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,875
Can you go check and just tell us anything?

1477
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:16,875
<i> Yes, I will be happy to.

1478
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:18,757
<i>Does she realize that we're gonna</i> miss the show?

1479
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,224
Of course.

1480
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:23,854
Should I go and, like, ,hustle her out?

1481
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:25,523
<i>Your mom or Debbie?

1482
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:34,444
Here comes the old lady. I'm very sorry.

1483
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:35,737
Yay!

1484
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,360
We're here, Mom, right here.

1485
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,656
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1486
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,370
So, hello, gorgeous.

1487
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:43,661
Who said that?

1488
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:45,004
I want to tell you all

1489
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:47,539
what fun it is to go out on the town.

1490
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,873
<i>Have a good time.

1491
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:50,078
Thank you.

1492
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:56,007
I just want to say...

1493
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:57,510
Your segment.

1494
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,221
What is my award? Now I can't even think.

1495
01:25:00,262 --> 01:25:02,182
You're getting the Lifetime Achievement Award.

1496
01:25:02,223 --> 01:25:03,933
Life-- well, that's the thing, see?

1497
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,564
I get upset, so I can't remember anything.

1498
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,892
It's an achievement that you even got here.

1499
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,558
That's the real achievement.

1500
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,266
This is the what award?

1501
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:14,476
<i>Lifetime Achievement.

1502
01:25:14,527 --> 01:25:16,277
- But...
- Screen Actors Guild.

1503
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,200
- Screen Actors Guild.
- But it's on the prompter.

1504
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,609
Carrie, was the prompter big enough?

1505
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:20,947
The prompter is huge.

1506
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,281
I just want to know what it is.

1507
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,116
Like, in real life right now,

1508
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:25,661
like we're talking here--

1509
01:25:25,704 --> 01:25:28,124
we're talking, and we're just saying.

1510
01:25:28,165 --> 01:25:30,615
<i>We're just saying it's the SAG Lifetime Achievement Award.

1511
01:25:30,668 --> 01:25:34,838
It's just called
a Life Achievement--

1512
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,460
like S-A-G?

1513
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,758
SAG Lifetime Achievement Award.

1514
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:40,261
Screen Actors Guild.

1515
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:43,392
- SAG. SAG.
- <i>SAG. Lifetime.

1516
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,760
You don't really have to say it, I don't think.

1517
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,218
- I have to say it.
- I'm not worried about that.

1518
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:48,678
I just want to really know--

1519
01:25:48,727 --> 01:25:50,017
She's gonna set it all up for you.

1520
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:51,652
I just really want to know what it really is.

1521
01:25:51,689 --> 01:25:53,519
Right now, I just blanked out.

1522
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:56,816
<i>It's the biggest honor in your industry.

1523
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,357
- It is?
-<i> It's a big deal.

1524
01:26:00,406 --> 01:26:03,316
- I mean, it actually is.
- It is!

1525
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,197
<i>No, it is. It's the biggest honor.

1526
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:08,124
Do you have enough air on you back there?

1527
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,956
You know, you keep asking me questions.

1528
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:16,342
- Did you--?
- I don't need any questions.

1529
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,510
Don't ask you questions. Okay.

1530
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:23,680
I'm just trying to stay, uh, level,

1531
01:26:23,721 --> 01:26:26,721
like I'm-- I'm-- I'm, uh...

1532
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,465
<i>Don't talk to us. Just relax.

1533
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,057
<i>Just breathe.

1534
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,442
<i>If you could slow down just a tiny,

1535
01:26:32,479 --> 01:26:33,939
<i>tiny, tiny little bit.

1536
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:35,441
<i>I know you're being coached.

1537
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:38,322
<i>Vomiting is a possibility.

1538
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:39,530
I know.

1539
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:41,110
Best of all, don't-- don't--

1540
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:44,818
I don't-- no, I'm not.

1541
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:49,749
I know.

1542
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,708
- Ohh.
- Okay, here we go.

1543
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:54,749
Looks like I'm going onstage.

1544
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:57,173
<i>Please welcome Carrie Fisher.

1545
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,299
Okay.

1546
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:06,756
Uh...

1547
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:09,505
I am very close to this year's

1548
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:14,478
Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award honoree.

1549
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:16,311
Hey!

1550
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,437
<i> Gary, look, there's your mommy.

1551
01:27:18,484 --> 01:27:21,574
<i>I found it difficult to share my mother

1552
01:27:21,612 --> 01:27:23,612
<i> with her adoring fans...

1553
01:27:23,656 --> 01:27:27,526
She's nervous as hell, isn't she?

1554
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:30,326
<i>She has lived two lives...

1555
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:34,081
<i>I mean, she was throwing up leading into this.

1556
01:27:34,124 --> 01:27:36,714
I'm sure Carrie's flipping out.

1557
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:39,962
I am proud to present

1558
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:44,215
the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award

1559
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:47,799
to my mother, Debbie Reynolds!

1560
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:50,506
Ahh!

1561
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,685
Thank you. Thank you.

1562
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,737
I want to thank the Screen Actors Guild

1563
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,071
for awarding me with this tonight.

1564
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,777
It's very unexpected.

1565
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,657
And, you know, I've been in the business now...

1566
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:14,754
...66 years.

1567
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,710
And, uh, my favorite movie was "Singin' in the Rain."

1568
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:20,962
Well, I did mention-- did I say that? Yeah.

1569
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:23,255
And I had a good time making that picture,

1570
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,008
wearing myself out.

1571
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,510
God gave us talent, so we're very fortunate.

1572
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,763
We all are.

1573
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,514
What we do best, believe in it.

1574
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:32,556
And of course, we-- we do that of course,

1575
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:35,769
and my favorite movie was "The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"

1576
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,101
and I had a lot of fun doing that.

1577
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,147
<i>Thank you.

1578
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,149
In that movie, I got to sing

1579
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,901
a wonderful film-- uh, song,

1580
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:47,114
called, uh, "I Ain't Down Yet."

1581
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:49,406
Well, I ain't.

1582
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,580
Thank you all very much for this wonderful award.

1583
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,996
<i>Thank you.

1584
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,040
<i>Coming up-- Ethan Hawke,

1585
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,757
<i> Patricia Arquette, Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg,

1586
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:08,969
<i> and, with a special tribute, Liev Schreiber.

1587
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,944
- How was it?
- It was fine.

1588
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,441
- Fine.
- Were you nervous at all up there?

1589
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:27,244
- Um, yes, but not for--
- I was nervous. I was nervous!

1590
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,529
When did you not get nervous?

1591
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,862
You seemed like you settled down.

1592
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:31,447
Well, no, it wasn't that I--

1593
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,782
the whole evening, to me, was wonderful.

1594
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:37,157
And there's no business like show business.

1595
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,536
- Tonight--
- You know what?

1596
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,122
I have to say something.

1597
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:44,457
Everything about it is appealing.

1598
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,216
Something that the traffic will applaud.

1599
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,088
Everything. No, seriously, everything,

1600
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,835
well, the traffic will allow.

1601
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,347
- Nowhere can you get...
- <i>That happy feeling.

1602
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,099
When you're stealing--

1603
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,521
and I don't mean, you know, out-and-out stealing...

1604
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,810
An extra bow.

1605
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,443
Extra bow.

1606
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,190
But there's no people like show people.

1607
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,442
There are people like show people.

1608
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,114
- Nah, it's true.
- Now, that's true.

1609
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,032
Well, the smiling when they're low...

1610
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:11,911
- ...us schizophrenics are like that.
- Oh, really?

1611
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,369
- So, they're like show people.
- Really?

1612
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:18,619
If they offered you another Life Achievement Award, would you do it?

1613
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:21,464
Now, I can't be funny about tonight.

1614
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,290
It's too special.

1615
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,955
- Okay.
- It was a special night.

1616
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,463
But that was a good question, though.

1617
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:28,625
Could you handle another life achievement award?

1618
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:30,224
'Cause they're gonna see that you did one,

1619
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,629
and they're gonna want to do--

1620
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:32,877
That's right, the floodgates are open.

1621
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,718
I can't answer it, because...

1622
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,303
it's too special,

1623
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,428
and I won't be here then.

1624
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,345
I will have gone on.

1625
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:41,984
So it's very important for this moment--

1626
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,650
For the<i> big </i>life achievement.

1627
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,820
You don't get a chance

1628
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:50,240
to have a moment like this very often.

1629
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,399
It's not like any moment.

1630
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,487
It's its own special moment.

1631
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:25,979
Yeah! "Ever since this world began."

1632
01:31:28,734 --> 01:31:31,194
<i>All right, we have to stop,

1633
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,486
<i> as my therapist likes to say.

1634
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:34,990
<i>Say good night, George.

1635
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,362
<i> Can't you say, "Good night, George,"

1636
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,868
<i> and I'll say, "Good night, Gracie"?

1637
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,740
<i>That's not original, Mother.

1638
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,116
<i>Oh, I know, but it shouldn't be.

1639
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:42,543
<i> It should be just simply funny.

1640
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:44,081
<i> It's slightly amusing to you.

1641
01:31:44,124 --> 01:31:45,674
<i>Why continue working so hard?

1642
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,079
<i>Say good night.

1643
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:48,877
<i>Good night,

1644
01:31:48,921 --> 01:31:51,051
<i> and thank you for joining us here

1645
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:53,919
<i> around our family "herth"-- "harth."

1646
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:56,297
<i>Hearth!

1647
01:31:57,721 --> 01:31:59,431
<i>You know I loved you.

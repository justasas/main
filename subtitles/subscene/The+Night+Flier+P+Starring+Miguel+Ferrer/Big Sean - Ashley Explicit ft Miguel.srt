1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:08,597
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world

2
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:16,761
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl

3
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:26,520
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

4
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:35,463
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz

5
00:00:35,463 --> 00:00:37,429
Got less miles on it than I do friends

6
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:41,044
Remember when we laid at you and Paige's crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent

7
00:00:41,044 --> 00:00:45,101
Remember when we couldn't get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don't spend shit

8
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:49,733
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn't afford nothin' but we still get shit ironically

9
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,463
Those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl

10
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:57,686
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe it's because I had you girl

11
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:59,866
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris

12
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,509
And gave each other times that we cherished

13
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:05,481
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed

14
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:08,758
See those are times I can't let go, I can't let go

15
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:11,962
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs

16
00:01:11,962 --> 00:01:14,594
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like "let's go"

17
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:21,703
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world

18
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:29,899
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl

19
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:39,575
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

20
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:45,630
Can't nobody do it like, do it like, do it like

21
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,139
My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets

22
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:54,167
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep

23
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:58,378
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful

24
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,887
Yeah I know you're not supposed to hate cake and eat it too

25
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:04,658
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?

26
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:10,922
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It's been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D and ain't came back since

27
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:15,003
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That's about the time that you left for the city

28
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:19,475
You and all your girls moved to NY,
I shoulda' known now how you watch sex and the city

29
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:23,134
I know we ain't close but, I gotta focus on blowing up

30
00:02:23,134 --> 00:02:27,253
I know I promised that I'd be there, and really did I ever show up?

31
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:31,967
I know I wasn't honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl, Brought problems to your world

32
00:02:31,967 --> 00:02:35,142
And you said "how could you just lie to me? I thought you'd die for me?"

33
00:02:35,157 --> 00:02:37,701
I was scared you'd find somebody who would treat you like they're supposed to

34
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:40,046
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to

35
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:43,981
And when thanksgivings come around,
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma

36
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:50,114
So it's back to the drama,
"No I don't know that number"

37
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:54,461
"Why the hell you text it?"
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in

38
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,666
Young and living reckless

39
00:02:55,666 --> 00:03:02,561
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world

40
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:10,820
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:20,005
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

42
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:26,770
Can't nobody do it like, do it like, do it like

43
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:36,651
I can't imagine myself without you
I need a whole lot of help without you

44
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:43,783
Me and my granny both agree
Damn you're such a G I'll hold you down forever, B

45
00:03:43,783 --> 00:03:51,449
And I, I wouldn't trade it for the world, world, world

46
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:59,486
And I, Just so fucking lucky you're my girl, girl, girl

47
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:09,529
And I, I wouldn't trade it for anything
No, no, no not anything and you

48
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:15,294
Can't nobody do it like, do it like, do it like

49
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:21,897
My bad for those long long nights, long nights

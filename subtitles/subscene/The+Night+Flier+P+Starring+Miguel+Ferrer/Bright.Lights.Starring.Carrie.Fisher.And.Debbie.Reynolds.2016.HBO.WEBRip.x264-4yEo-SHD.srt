<i> ( music playing )</i>

2
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,452
Carrie Fisher:
<i> Hello.</i>

3
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,742
<i> We're here with a woman</i>
<i> who alleges</i>

4
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,036
<i> to be my mother.</i>

5
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,750
<i> I don't buy it</i>
<i> for a minute.</i>

6
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,670
<i> But this is how</i>
<i> we'll find out.</i>

7
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,628
Debbie Reynolds:
<i> I have proof.</i>

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,421
Carrie:
<i> You have films.</i>

9
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:51,465
Reynolds:
<i> I have films and I have</i>
<i> a certificate.</i>

10
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,010
Carrie:
<i> You have the films</i>
<i> that I'm happy.</i>

11
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,564
Reynolds:
<i> Oh, yes. Well, because</i>
<i> you doubted it for so long.</i>

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
Carrie:
<i> You knew that I was</i>
<i> gonna doubt it later,</i>

13
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,480
<i> so you filmed me</i>
<i> being happy.</i>

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,400
Reynolds:
<i> No, I thought that</i>
<i> if you filmed children,</i>

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,189
<i> and you had happy children</i>
<i> and then you filmed it--</i>

16
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,983
-<i> ( Carrie laughs ) Exposure!</i>
- Reynolds:<i> Who knew when you</i>
<i> were going to grow up</i>

17
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:12,068
<i> and say, "I'm very unhappy,"</i>
<i> and "That's a fake film,"</i>
<i> that I made it up.</i>

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,704
Carrie:
<i> This is getting</i>
<i> so ugly so fast.</i>

19
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,451
<i> ( Reynolds laughs )</i>

20
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,703
<i> You have to try</i>
<i> to concentrate</i>

21
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,405
<i> on the fact</i>
<i> that you did have,</i>
<i> sometimes, good times.</i>

22
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,207
Carrie:
<i> I know that I did!</i>
<i> I had a very good time.</i>

23
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,001
Reynolds:
<i> See how you yelled?</i>

24
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,995
<i> At your mother?</i>

25
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,127
Carrie:
<i> What about Todd?</i>

26
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,514
<i> Do you like Todd</i>
<i> better than me?</i>

27
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,971
<i> ( Reynolds sighs )</i>
<i> No. It's just that</i>
<i> you're different.</i>

28
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,262
-<i> Every child</i>
is different, so--
- Carrie:<i> I don't buy this.</i>

29
00:01:37,306 --> 00:01:39,926
Reynolds:
<i> You never bought anything</i>
<i> that I said, so...</i>

30
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,265
Carrie:
<i> Okay, what does he get</i>
<i> in the will and what do I get?</i>

31
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,731
Reynolds:
<i> Oh, I'm not gonna</i>
<i> tell anybody that.</i>

32
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:52,066
Carrie:
<i> If we lived together,</i>
<i> we would argue.</i>

33
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,452
Reynolds:
<i> Yes.</i>

34
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,240
<i> It's possible.</i>

35
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,873
<i> ( music playing )</i>

36
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,832
<i> ¶ Just in time ¶</i>

37
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,547
<i> ¶ I found you</i>
<i> just in time ¶</i>

38
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,589
<i> ¶ Before you came,</i>
<i> my time ¶</i>

39
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,094
<i> ¶ Was running low ¶</i>

40
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,055
<i> ¶ Mm, I was lost ¶</i>

41
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,180
<i> ¶ The losing dice</i>
<i> were tossed ¶</i>

42
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:27,598
<i> ¶ My bridges</i>
<i> all were crossed ¶</i>

43
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,568
<i> ¶ Nowhere to go ¶</i>

44
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,241
<i> ¶ Now you're here ¶</i>

45
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:39,281
<i> ¶ And now I know</i>
<i> just where I'm going ¶</i>

46
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,826
<i> ¶ No more doubt or fear ¶</i>

47
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:45,711
<i> ¶ I've found my way ¶</i>

48
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,249
<i> ¶ But love came</i>
<i> just in time ¶</i>

49
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,795
<i> ¶ You found me</i>
<i> just in time ¶</i>

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,420
<i> ¶ And changed</i>
<i> my lonely life ¶</i>

51
00:02:55,467 --> 00:03:00,637
<i> ¶ That lovely day ¶</i>

52
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,602
<i> ¶ Yeah! ¶</i>

53
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,477
<i> ( music continues )</i>

54
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,344
Carrie:
<i> How long has it</i>
<i> been done for?</i>

55
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,006
<i> I'm done for.</i>

56
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,508
Ugh!

57
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:46,017
Fucking criminy!

58
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,140
I'm gonna go help
my mother pack.

59
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,518
My mother is performing
a show in Connecticut.

60
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,646
I tried to stop her,

61
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,363
but that is like throwing
yourself in front of a...

62
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,526
Oh, what are those called?

63
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,365
<i> Not tiramisus.</i>

64
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,200
Tsunami. See?
She's "Tsu-Mommy."

65
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,496
And I threw myself
in front of Tsu-Mommy,
and it didn't work.

66
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,332
<i>She loves doing it</i>
<i>when she's doing it,</i>

67
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:16,128
but afterwards, she was
laying on the floor, so...

68
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:20,183
But in a good, dignified,
movie star way.

69
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,465
Mother and I live
next door to each other,

70
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:30,386
separated
by one daunting hill.

71
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,847
I usually come to her.

72
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,782
I always come to her.

73
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,242
<i> ( dog barking )</i>

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,910
Mommy!
Mommy, I'm home!

75
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,531
Reynolds:
<i> Hello!</i>

76
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,497
Where--
look, you cannot
keep that phone.

77
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,789
It's ridiculous.

78
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,713
<i>That's from the early '90s,</i>
<i>when they first invented</i>
<i>cell phones.</i>

79
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,803
- But I--
- That was
one of the originals.

80
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,299
I don't want to buy
a new one.

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,880
The old phone works fine.

82
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,676
Just dandy.

83
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,391
- It's horrible.
- Oh! There she is.

84
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,811
- Look. Look at all the--
- Do you know how to do it?

85
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,180
- Do you know how to do it?
- No. No one knows how to use
those anymore.

86
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,558
Reynolds:
That is a beautiful puff.

87
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:17,315
Thank you for
the beautiful soufflé.

88
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,979
- I love it.
- Carrie:<i> Is it good?</i>

89
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,568
Reynolds:
<i>¶ Delicioso! ¶</i>

90
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,533
You want to sing
with me?

91
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,074
Fisher Stevens:
<i> Debbie, what do you</i>
<i> wear in the show?</i>

92
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,618
Carrie:
A very heavy
beaded dress.

93
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,502
It is quite beautiful.

94
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,669
It's beautiful,
but it weighs more
than she does.

95
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,499
( laughs )
It does weigh--

96
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,924
it does weigh
about 50 pounds.

97
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,633
- But it's<i> so</i> beautiful.
- Worth it!

98
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
Now, that's--
that's Elizabeth's.

99
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,263
This belonged to...

100
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,095
I bought that
at Elizabeth Taylor's
auction.

101
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,851
- I won it.
- This is when--
during her muumuu phase.

102
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,814
Yeah. Well,
it's pretty, really.

103
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,524
Look.

104
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,114
It has a drag queen
element.

105
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,530
Oh, now, just do
what your mother says.
It makes life easier.

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,690
As if.

107
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,198
- Yeah.
- All right.

108
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,699
You remember me?
I'm your mother.

109
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,661
- I remember.
-<i> ¶ Tammy, Tammy... ¶</i>

110
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:10,871
I keep you very close, so--
constant reminder.

111
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,703
Carrie:
<i>Is this for the show?</i>

112
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,248
Reynolds:
<i> I forgot I had it.</i>

113
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,871
That's what's good
about losing your memory

114
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,418
is there's so many
surprises in the world.

115
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,172
I have found
some things work.

116
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,215
Not enough.

117
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,798
There's never
enough Listerine.

118
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,513
I'm gonna go fill it.
I'm just gonna go fill it.

119
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,643
Remember, we had a relative
that drank Listerine...

120
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:33,601
- She was an alcoholic.
- ...and 18 bottles
of vanilla.

121
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:34,814
- Okay.
- That's it. That's all.

122
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,653
Okay, look.

123
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,228
Turn around this way
because your rear end

124
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,113
is to the camera.

125
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,900
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,525
I don't like not knowing
what's happening.

127
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,242
- I worry a little.
- Reynolds:<i> That's very sweet.</i>

128
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,413
I worry what
the show costs you.

129
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,122
That's all.
I know you like to do it.

130
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,962
I have caught up
with a few people in age.

131
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,618
Whoa!

132
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:59,247
<i>But they're in bed</i>
<i>and you're doing a show.</i>

133
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,594
<i> Like George Burns says,</i>

134
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,260
I'm gonna stay on stage
until I drop dead.

135
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,378
And then I'm gonna
have myself stuffed,

136
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,005
like Trigger,

137
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,762
and then I'll put me
in a museum.

138
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,144
-<i> That's nice.</i>
- Do you like that?

139
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,060
Or we could just leave
this house...

140
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,769
Carrie:
<i> I totally understand</i>
<i> why she's doing it,</i>

141
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,310
<i> and it makes me nervous.</i>

142
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:20,864
<i> She'll forget she's not 35.</i>

143
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,479
You know, it doesn't
make sense to her

144
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,647
that her body
isn't cooperating.

145
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,027
<i> And she just thinks</i>
<i> if she ignores it,</i>

146
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,946
<i> it'll go away.</i>

147
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:39,076
Everything in me
demands that my mother be
as she always was,

148
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:42,376
even if that way
is irritating.

149
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,591
She just can't change.

150
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,721
That's the rule.

151
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:49,218
And she's fucking with me.

152
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,841
<i> Age is--</i>

153
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,678
<i> it's horrible</i>
<i> for all of us,</i>

154
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,894
but she falls
from a greater height.

155
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,476
- ¶ Good morning ¶
- ¶ Good morning ¶

156
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,573
¶ We've talked
the whole night through ¶

157
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:08,109
- ¶ Good morning ¶
- ¶ Good morning to you ¶

158
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,065
<i> ¶ Good morning,</i>
<i> good morning ¶</i>

159
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,776
<i> ¶ It's great</i>
<i> to stay up late ¶</i>

160
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,866
<i> ¶ Good morning,</i>
<i> good morning ¶</i>

161
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,372
<i> ¶ To you ¶</i>

162
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,714
<i> ¶ When the band</i>
<i> began to play ¶</i>

163
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,880
<i> ¶ The stars</i>
<i> were shining bright ¶</i>

164
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,169
<i> ¶ Now the milkman's</i>
<i> on his way ¶</i>

165
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,883
<i> ¶ It's too late</i>
<i> to say good night ¶</i>

166
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,423
<i> ¶ So, good morning,</i>
<i> good morning ¶</i>

167
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,927
<i> ¶ Sunbeams</i>

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,020
¶ We've gabbed

172
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:42,812
¶ Good morning,
good morning to you ¶

173
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,606
¶ Nothing could be grander

Man:<i> Debbie's light</i>

175
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,939
-<i> Yes or no?</i>
- Man #2:<i> Yes.</i>

176
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,067
Man:<i> Okay.</i>
<i> You know, all this stuff</i>

177
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,494
<i> is, like, blocked</i>

178
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,663

<i> ( crew chattering )</i>

180
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
And I think I only
got nervous once

181
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:04,083
when I performed
for the Queen of England.

182
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,587
I went over with Bob Hope
to do a show,

183
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,381
and I did get
a little nervous there.

184
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:13,974
The crown, the jewels
kind of threw me a little bit.

185
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,012
But as a rule, I don't--
I don't get nervous.

186
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,927
I just have a good time.

187
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,017
<i> I've been doing this</i>

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:26,313
<i> You know, I started</i>

189
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,398
Stevens:
<i> Will you know your set</i>
<i> already and everything?</i>

190
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,283
Reynolds:
<i> Oh, yes, I'm all set.</i>

191
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,240
I carry my script
in my beat-up folder.

192
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,583
You can see how beat up.

193
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:42,249
And all the edges
are all worn out.

194
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,671
<i> And if you can make</i>
<i> people smile a little,</i>
<i> laugh a little,</i>

195
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,752

196
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:52,418
It's not "Macbeth,"
you know.

197
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:53,927
How are you tonight?

198
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,509
You're such a nice,
attractive audience.

199
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,104
Now, you don't mind
if I come out, do you?

200
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,309
See, I like
to visit with you.

201
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,638
Otherwise,
I'm stuck up there.

202
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,603
I've seen my act.
Good evening.

203
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,523
Reynolds:
<i> I used to go out</i>
<i> in the audience.</i>

204
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:04,892
<i> I used to do that.</i>

205
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,898
<i> I used to wear</i>
<i> a girdle, too,</i>

206
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,231

<i> ( laughing )</i>

208
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,743
So, it's like
the old days,
in a way,

209
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,361
but I'm like
the old days, so...

210
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,198
( laughs )

211
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,793
Can you do me a favor
while you're down there?

212
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,999
Yeah?

213
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,249
- You see that toe?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,041
That has to come around.

215
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,285
That...

216
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,958
See that?
It has to go to the--

217
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,417
- Underneath?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,006
( laughs )
Thank you.

219
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,724
I'm pulling
your leg, huh?

220
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,715
I have to do it.
Thank you. Thank you.

221
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:45,938
Okay, Kevin is gonna do,
like, an introductory thing.

222
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,349
Five minutes, yeah.

223
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,317
Yeah.
So, when do you
want him to start?

224
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:51,689
When?

225
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,895
But David's already
asked me this.

226
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,775
Oh, he did?
He didn't tell him, though.

227
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,533
- Now.
- Now.

228
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,115
Go!

<i> ( cheering and applause</i>

I look around
and I see all you nice men.

233
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,510
You're very sweet.
I'm sure you're nice.

234
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,341
It's just that if there's
a nice guy around,

235
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:22,348
- I'm not gonna find him.
- ( laughter )

236
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,641
-<i> You remember Eddie Fisher?</i>
- Crowd: Yes.

237
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,484
Carrie told me,
"Mommy, doesn't--

238
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,941
doesn't it start to look like
Eddie's the good one?"

239
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:32,482
( laughter )

240
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,936
<i>After Eddie,</i>
<i>I married again.</i>

241
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,856
He was very rich, too.
That was helpful.

242
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,156
I thought
that was very nice.

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,580
<i> But then I found out,</i>
<i> after we were married,</i>

244
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:47,039
he was a gamble-oholic,
and he lost all of his money.

245
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,712
<i> I should have married</i>
<i> Burt Reynolds.</i>

246
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,461
I wouldn't have to change
my last name.

<i> ( laughter )</i>

248
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,758

- ( rim shot )
-<i> ( cheering )</i>

250
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,298
<i> So, I thought,</i>
<i> I'll bring along</i>

251
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,888
some of my first movies.

252

Now, this is
my one little hit.

259
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:26,328
It's called "Tammy."

260
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,331
Here we go.

will come out.

People were loving it.
That was so awesome.

274
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,766
Okay, we're going
this way, though.

275
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,442
Great.

276
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,278
Good.

277
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,901
Okay.

278
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,358
And...

279
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,117
one more.

280
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,239

Carrie:
<i> It is very frustrating</i>
<i> for her,</i>

285

¶ Why do I feel
like a feather? ¶

¶ Why do I sing

¶ Why, when it's clear,
lovely weather ¶

Carrie:
<i> Performing gives her life.</i>

297
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:27,993
<i> It feeds her in a way</i>
<i> that family cannot.</i>

298
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,834
That's why I think it--
we've always been frustrating.

299
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,621
Because... it's not--

300
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,287
people aren't cooperative,
audiences are.

301
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,586

Whoo!

313
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,414
Carrie:
<i> My mother wanted</i>
<i> to be able to groom me</i>

314

Carrie:
<i> The biggest thing I did</i>

¶ Oh, when times
get rough... ¶

323
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,279
Carrie:<i> My mother would say,</i>
<i> "Do drugs. Do whatever</i>

Carrie:
<i> That was my big rebellion.</i>

Reynolds:
<i> Carrie's daddy, Eddie,</i>
<i> had a great voice, you know.</i>

331

<i> Really beautiful voice.</i>

332
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:15,555
I guess she doesn't want
to be Eddie and she doesn't
want to be Debbie.

333
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,020
She wants to be Carrie,
so she'll do it her way.

¶ I'm gonna ease
your mind ¶

337
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,962
I love that voice.

338
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,209
Isn't that a great voice?

339
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,252
I wish I had it.

340
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,587
<i> ( applause continues )</i>

341
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,842
Take a bow,

take a bow.

00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,644
Man:
<i> Bravo! Bravo!</i>

343
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,719
<i> Bravo!</i>

344
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,644
That's not bad
for a 15-year-old, is it?

345
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,102
<i> ( music playing )</i>

346
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,871
Carrie:
<i> So, this is the compound.</i>

347
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:23,213
<i> It was built</i>
<i> by Robert Armstrong,</i>
<i> who was in "King Kong,"</i>

348
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,961

349
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,795
<i> I've lived in this for--</i>
<i> let me see--</i>

350
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,671
<i> 20 years.</i>

351
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,758
<i> This is the lobby.</i>

352
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,393
This is where
early mornings are spent

353
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,351
with people
who drink coffee.

354
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,771
And there's
a hummingbird nest.

355
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,311
Look how teeny.

356
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,105
<i> This is the bathroom.</i>

357
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,479
It has, as a lot
of bathrooms should,

358
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,277
a player piano in it.

359
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,241
This is Bette Davis
when she lived here.

360
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,122
This is my suitcase,
Robert.

361
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Oh.

362
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,789
Ugly children portraiture.

363
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,620
They did this thing
in the last century

364
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:07,746
<i> where they dressed boys</i>
<i> in girls' clothing.</i>

365
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,956
<i> He looks like Ross Perot</i>
<i> in red.</i>

366
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:15,257
<i> Shia LaBeouf as a Dutch</i>
<i> underage prostitute.</i>

367
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,053
<i> And Richard Dreyfuss</i>

368
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,676
<i> as a young girl</i>
<i> wielding a rose.</i>

369
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,684
<i> Richard likes that.</i>

370
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,096
<i> Now, this just happens to be</i>
<i> probably an unhappy woman</i>

371
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,147
<i> that looks like</i>
<i> Kevin Spacey.</i>

372
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,612
They sold this
on the Internet

373
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,403
as a Princess Leia
sex doll.

374
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,241
Maybe this.

375
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,911
There's no way
of accounting for it.

376
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:46,707
<i> My daughter, Billie.</i>

377
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,581
<i> My brother and myself.</i>

378
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,208
<i> And Billie.</i>

379
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:51,995
<i> And my mother</i>
<i> and Judy Garland.</i>

380
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,168
And my friend, Charlie,
at the dentist

381
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:57,427
with his mouth
widely displayed.

382
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:01,683
<i> My house-- I love it.</i>

383
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:04,814
<i> It's like</i>
<i> scavenger hunting.</i>

384
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,693
<i> And my mother--</i>

385
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,439
there's part of it
she kind of tolerates.

386
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,322
"Well, this is just
Carrie's thing."

387
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:17,491
<i> This is the opposite</i>
<i> of the house that</i>
<i> I grew up in.</i>

388
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,622
<i> ( projector whirring )</i>

389
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,116
<i> The house we lived in</i>
<i> was very grand</i>

390
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,293
<i> when I was growing up.</i>

391
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:29,422
<i> It was marble and glass.</i>

392
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,250
<i> Cold.</i>

393
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,916
<i> And there was just</i>
<i> too much air in it.</i>

394
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,586
<i> Family-wise, we didn't</i>
<i> grow up with each other,</i>

395
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:41,096
<i> we grew up</i>
<i> around each other.</i>

396
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,929
<i> You know, like trees.</i>

397
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,099
<i> My mother,</i>
<i> she worked a lot.</i>

398
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:51,356
<i> And then Harry,</i>
<i> her husband at the time,</i>

399
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,149
<i> he was the original</i>
<i> fancy-man, rich guy.</i>

400
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,777
<i> It was a prototype life.</i>

401
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,993
<i> We were getting ready</i>
<i> for a photoshoot</i>

402
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,624
<i> all the time.</i>

403
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,370
<i> And that's what</i>
<i> Todd and I shared.</i>

404
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,455
<i> Todd and I had</i>
<i> a shared history</i>
<i> of weirdness.</i>

405
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,722
<i> ( dog barking )</i>

406
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
Yes?

407
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,564
Who is it?

408
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,358
- Come in.
- Hi! I just wanted to say hi.

409
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,691
She brought her chicken in.
Speaking of science fiction.

410
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,027
- Hello.
- We've never met.

411
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:41,663
And this is Nugget.

412
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:44,239
He travels everywhere
with her.

413
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,615
He goes everywhere with me
'cause he's my emotional
wellness chicken.

414
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,124
And he's just--

415
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:50,615
We're gonna get him
a service tag

416
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,957
so he can be
a service chicken.

417
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,921
I have to drive
everywhere currently...

418
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,422
- With a harness.
- ...because they won't
let chickens fly.

419
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:58,384
- ( clucking )
- What? Yeah.

420
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,974
- He's my boy.
- That's right.

421
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,179
Sorry.
I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

422
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:03,299
No, I was just telling
the poster story.

423
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,926
In fact, I was telling her
the only reason why we
bought this house

424
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,723
was so I could hang
my posters somewhere.

425
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:11,233
So, I decided I would
tell a story on this wall.

426
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,400
My mother made this movie
called "Singin' in the Rain,"
down there,

427
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,150
and that's an original
"Singin' in the Rain" poster.

428
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,152
Then she went on to do
"Tammy and the Bachelor,"

429
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,284
where she sings
the song "Tammy."

430
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:24,201
Then she makes a movie
with Frank Sinatra called
"The Tender Trap."

431
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,412
And in this--
while she's making
this movie,

432
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,332
Frank Sinatra says,
"Now, Debbie, whatever you do,

433
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,252
do not marry a singer,
whatever you do."

434
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:37,041
So, she goes right out
and marries the singer,
my dad, Eddie Fisher.

435
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,378
<i> Then my dad ran off</i>
<i> with Elizabeth Taylor</i>

436
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,804
<i> and became a producer</i>
<i> on "Cleopatra."</i>

437
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,474
Then my dad goes on
and marries Liz,

438
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,853
and of course
they make the movie
"BUtterfield 8."

439
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,180
So, that's the story
of my life

440
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,766
in a certain amount
of posters.

441
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:54,232
Hickland:
<i> Do you know</i>
<i> what's funny, is Debbie,</i>

442
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,312
<i> when she first</i>
<i> came in here, she went,</i>

443
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,977
- "How can you allow this?"
- Right, too many Debbie
posters.

444
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,647
"To many Debbie posters.
Where's your stuff?"
She's just so awesome.

445
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,316
And I was like,
where else am I gonna
put your stuff?

446
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,914
Or what else
are we gonna do with it?

447
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,619
Sooner or later,
it's got to get up
on the wall.

448
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,909
Now, when I was younger,
"2001: A Space Odyssey"
came out

449
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,914
and I was very influenced
by how amazing that movie was.

450
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:14,997
<i> And then,</i>
<i> all of a sudden,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

451
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,543
<i> Carrie does</i>
<i> this little picture</i>
<i> called "Star Wars"</i>

452
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:18,706
she thought was gonna
be a B-movie.

453
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,375
I went to the screening
with her over at Fox,

454
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,424
and she was hiding
in the back with me

455
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:26,088
<i> 'cause she thought</i>
<i> it was gonna be</i>
<i> a cheesy film.</i>

456
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,257
<i> ( R2-D2 beeping )</i>

457
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,346
( beeping continues )

458
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,266
<i> ( music playing )</i>

459
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,076
Carrie:
<i> We are at a lap dance.</i>

460
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,040
Come on,
do it a little more.

461
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,161
- In the front,
the whole thing.
-<i> ( dog barks )</i>

462
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:57,668
Carrie:
<i> A celebrity lap dance,</i>

463
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,840
<i> which is where celebrities</i>
<i> of all shapes and ages</i>

464
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,920
<i> sign autographs</i>
<i> for cash prizes.</i>

465
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,757
<i> It's sort of like</i>
<i> going to a strip club,</i>

466
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:12,814
<i> except they don't stuff cash</i>
<i> in your underwear.</i>

467
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,640
<i> But that's kind of it.</i>

468
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:18,016
Woman:
It's Carrie Fisher,
everybody!

469
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,984
- ( cheering )
-<i> ( woman #2 chanting )</i>
<i> Carrie! Carrie!</i>

470
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,444
Hi there.
How are you doing?

471
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:27,448
- Good to meet you.
- That is great.

472
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,870
( laughs )
We'll get a photo later.

473
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,029
- It's a pleasure to...
"meat" you.
- Meet me.

474
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,498
- All right, thank you!
- Thank you so much.

475
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,039
Well, she's always been
my favorite on "Star Wars"
since I was a little kid.

476
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:41,044
I had a crush on her
since I was, like,
eight years old.

477
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,087
<i> So, I'd just like</i>
<i> to see her, you know?</i>

478
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:45,461
( gasps )
That's awesome!

479
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,428
That doesn't really look
like me in a way.

480
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,219
- Show me where.
- Right up here.

481
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,473
There?
How we go...

482
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,604
- Where do you want it?
- Right here.

483
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,060
- Nice and big.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:59,401
¶ And that's
my big old signature. ¶

485
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,268
There you go.
Thank you.

486
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,726
-<i> I really like</i>
your overall look.
- Thank you.

487
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,607
<i>That goes</i>
<i>without saying.</i>

488
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:09,074
Thank you.
I like your outfit on you.

489
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,735
- Thank you.
- No bra, though.

490
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:13,083
( laughs )
I'll remember that
next time.

491
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,699
-<i> Hey there.</i>
- Hello.

492
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,156
Abe Gurko:
<i> So, this is</i>
<i> one of these things</i>

493
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,116
<i> that we go to</i>
<i> at least once a month.</i>

494
00:24:20,168 --> 00:24:22,958
<i> They're kind of</i>
<i> a mini Comic-Con.</i>

495
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:26,424
Carrie resisted
these lap dances for years,

496
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,795
<i> but it's amazing!</i>

497
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:33,684
You see these thousands
of people that are
behind me here?

498
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:36,853
Okay, so, they line up
at 9:00 in the morning,

499
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,193
<i> they'll stay here</i>

Yeah, actually,

502
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,532

- Nice to meet you.

<i>How come?</i>

509
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:04,503
She just epitomizes
a strong woman

510

who speaks her mind,

511
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,876

a very pivotal character

538

I realized how much

<i> Shirley MacLaine</i>
<i> and Meryl Streep.</i>

I was just a mess.

651

And some of the things
that are in the movie happened.

652
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,902
- Any idea what she's taken?
- Woman:<i> Pills, sir.</i>

653
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,652
-<i> Demerol,</i>
<i> Percodan, and cocaine.</i>
- Give me her vitals.

You don't say it,
but you feel it.

660
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,035
Somehow you lay
the entire blame for
your drug taking on me.

661

I do not!
I do not, Mother.

662
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,090

00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:25,897
<i> We used to</i>
<i> smoke weed together</i>
<i> and we had a lot of fun.</i>

668
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,404
<i> And then, you know,</i>
<i> she moved on to other things,</i>

669
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:31,278
<i> and I didn't.</i>

670
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,913
<i> When I would stop,</i>
<i> she would keep going.</i>

671
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,792
Carrie:
<i> I knew something</i>
<i> was the matter with me.</i>

672
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,586
<i> I went too fast.</i>

673
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,510
<i> I was too much.</i>

674
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:48,588
<i> And I was embarrassed</i>
<i> of it.</i>

675
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,602
<i> The drugs I liked</i>
<i> were painkillers.</i>

676
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,600
<i> They calmed me down.</i>

677
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:59,431
I just couldn't--

678
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,138
I couldn't handle it.

679
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:02,938
I didn't know
what "it" was.

680
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:08,856
Reynolds:
<i> Manic depressive</i>
<i> is a disease.</i>

681
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,784
<i> Now, that was</i>
<i> not diagnosed then,</i>

682
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,324
so nobody kind of knew
what was going on with Carrie.

683
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,788
When she was 13,
her personality changed.

684
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,123
<i> So it's a constant battle</i>

685
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,666
<i> that takes all of us</i>

686
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,000
<i> to assure her</i>
<i> that she's loved,</i>

687
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,586
and that won't get her.

688
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:34,085
Hard.
Yeah, it's hard.

689
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,928
That's the hardest part.

690
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,266
<i> ( chorus singing )</i>

691
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,560
It's Christmas
here in China on the Wall,

692
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,524
and we're headed
toward the top.

693
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:45,935
Todd:
<i> Come with us.</i>

694
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,153
<i> Join us on a walk</i>

695

698
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,825

Chorus:
<i> ¶ He's making a list</i>

701
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:10,549
<i> ¶ Santa Claus</i>

<i> ¶ He sees you</i>

703
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:19,512
We look like we're tired!
We're having a ball!

<i> ¶ With the little tin horns</i>

705
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,731
Carrie:
<i> I have two moods.</i>

706
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,573
<i> Roy is Rollicking Roy,</i>

707
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,529
<i> a wild ride of a mood!</i>

708
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,029
Wow, some of
that methamphetamine
released itself,

709
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,491
and the brain slid
and there was some trapped

710
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:38,122
methamphetamine
from my father.

711
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,740
Woman:
<i> ¶ Jingle bells,</i>
<i> jingle bells ¶</i>

712
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,208
<i> ¶ Jingle all the way... ¶</i>

713
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,918
- Carrie:<i> Listen to the music.</i>
-<i> ( music distorting )</i>

714
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:48,539
It's melting
from the heat.

715
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,667
<i> ( distorted music</i>
<i> continues )</i>

716
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:04,180
Carrie:
<i> Pam is Sediment Pam,</i>

717
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,938
<i> who stands on the shore</i>
<i> and sobs.</i>

718

<i> One mood is the meal,</i>

719
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:12,901
<i> the next mood,</i>

720
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,855
<i> ( TV playing )</i>

721
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,406
Where am I in all this?
I have no idea.

722
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,041
Because I feel like
it's a little mood
relay, you know?

723
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,749
I'm Pam now.

724
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,294
( clears throat )

725
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:31,964
See, if Roy
got this cold...

726
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:33,755
he wouldn't let him
stop it.

727
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:39,756
'Cause Roy is bigger
than all of it.

728
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,385
But I just fit snugly

729
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:44,601
into the mood pocket
that is Pam.

730
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,983
I don't have any choice.

731
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,100
I don't dictate the ride.

732
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,396
<i> ( music playing )</i>

733
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,586
Look, the blue one, I think,
is probably better,

734
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,760
but this is crazier.

735
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:17,509
It's important to know.

736
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,511
Stevens:
<i> That is very nice sweater.</i>

737
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:22,263
Those are good
folk art colors.

738
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,506
That's what you are--
folk art.

739
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,557
Okay, see?
That's not bad.

740
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:29,942
And a person wearing this
would then have a room...

741
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,440
like this!

742
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,566
We met--

743
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:40,071
Debbie and Eddie
bought a house

744
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,615
two doors down
from where I lived.

745
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,288
I was 11 when they
first moved in, I think.

746
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:47,499
She was pregnant
with Todd.

747
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:48,909
- Carrie:<i> Debbie</i>
<i> worked a lot...</i>
- Yeah.

748
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,957
<i>...so she wasn't there,</i>
<i>so, you know,</i>

749
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:52,541
it's like you take
what you can get, really.

750
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,996
And if you can't have
Debbie Reynolds...

751
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:57,207
No, we wanted her.

752
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,339
Freiberg:
<i> Here's the deal--</i>
<i> Carrie at two</i>

753
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:05,637
<i> was more interesting</i>
<i> than anyone I've ever known.</i>

754
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:10,482
<i> Todd was a very happy child,</i>
<i> very easygoing.</i>

755
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,230
Carrie:
<i> But we weren't made</i>
<i> with each other in mind.</i>

756
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,904
Freiberg:
<i> No, you were very different.</i>

757
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,283
Carrie:
<i> I was jealous of that.</i>

758
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,950
It was simpler for him
for some reason.

759
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,699
Yeah.

760
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,951
Also, he didn't--

761
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,582
you suffered
from the divorce.

762
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,949
You had an attachment
to your dad,

763
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,956
<i> but he wasn't</i>
<i> around much.</i>

764
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,669
<i> And then</i>
<i> Elizabeth Taylor--</i>

765
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,460
- Carrie:<i> Oh, God.</i>

Liz, over here!

772
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,606
Freiberg:
<i> It was very dramatic.</i>

773
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,243
I want to get out.
Now.

774
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,990
Freiberg:
<i> And your mom was</i>
<i> quite dignified and quiet.</i>

00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,121
Reynolds:
I haven't even been informed.
I just got off the airplane.

777
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,705
I will not contest it, no.

778
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,166
Freiberg:
<i> All of a sudden,</i>
<i> there were photographers</i>

779
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,295
<i> on your front yard</i>
<i> or on the sidewalk.</i>

780
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,972
Carrie:
<i> Don't remember it.</i>

781
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,353
Freiberg:
<i> Coming out of the driveway,</i>

782
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,309
<i> they took your picture</i>
<i> in the car.</i>

783
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:32,309

<i> I don't remember it.</i>
<i> I don't remember it.</i>

784
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,142
- I don't want
to remember it.
- Yeah.

785
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,347
No, I do remember it.

786
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:36,977
I'm sure that
was very stressful.

787
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,024
I know
I didn't like that.

788
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:44,277
They were trampling me
and Todd to get to her,

789
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,992
so the sensation was that
she belonged to them.

790
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:52,195
My mom did say about her--
she said, "That's a sad child,"

791
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,827
and that's after,
I think, the divorce.

792
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:56,995
<i> She had this sadness,</i>

793
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,674
and then Harry Karl
was in the picture.

00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,803
<i>We were supposed</i>
<i>to call him "Daddy Harry."</i>

795

Yeah, that was
gonna happen.

00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:08,675
<i> He was just a mass of noises</i>
<i> and monograms.</i>

<i> ( both chuckle )</i>

798
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:11,892
Carrie:
<i> You have to</i>
<i> remember this.</i>

799
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:15,563
<i> There was an intercom,</i>
<i> and he would start calling,</i>

800
00:39:15,604 --> 00:39:18,814
( gravelly voice )
"Carri-i-e.

801
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:21,897
To-o-dd.

802

Hone-e-y."

803
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:26,699
"Honey"
was Debbie's name.

804
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,330
Freiberg:
<i>You know, he owned shoe stores,</i>
<i> so that didn't interest us.</i>

805
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,948
Carrie:
<i> Nothing about him</i>
<i> was interesting</i>

806
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:34,655
<i> until we found out</i>

Oh, God.

808
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,923
And here he comes now,

809
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,539
industrialist
and philanthropist,

810
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,746
a celebrity
in his own right,
Harry Karl.

811
00:39:41,797 --> 00:39:45,047
- And look who's with him--
Carrie and Todd.
-<i> ( applause )</i>

812

Todd:<i> Harry Karl</i>

813
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,099

<i> a great setup.</i>

814
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,968
- There's Mommy.
- There's Mommy, yeah.

00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,556
Todd:
<i> Loving, caring,</i>
<i> loved Carrie and I,</i>

816

<i> but we don't know at the time</i>
<i> that he has serious problems.</i>

817
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,191
<i> We don't know that</i>
<i> he is a compulsive gambler.</i>

818

<i> We don't know that he's</i>
<i> a compulsive drinker.</i>

819

<i> It was a disaster</i>
<i> in the making,</i>

820

<i> That was the tail end</i>
<i> of Carrie and I,</i>

831
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,782
<i> our innocence as children.</i>

832
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,534
<i> ( projector whirring )</i>

833
00:40:54,578 --> 00:40:56,738
- Okay, let's go.
- All right, let's go.

834
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,368
We're going
to see Debbie.

835
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,471
<i> Ma?</i>

836
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:14,931
Reynolds:
<i> Aw, I'm so happy to see you.</i>

837
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,563
<i> How are you?</i>

838
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,680
Freiberg:<i> I'm good.</i>
<i> How are you feeling?</i>

839
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,637
Reynolds:
<i> Shitty. Pretty bad.</i>

840
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:22,728
<i> ( camera clicks )</i>

841
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,562
Reynolds:

842
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:26,478
Freiberg:
<i> Truly, you look</i>
<i> so beautiful.</i>

843
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,486
<i> You have to believe me.</i>

844
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,909
Carrie:
<i> I'm dizzy, and I think</i>
<i> I caught it from you.</i>

845
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,868
Reynolds:
<i> Here, you want some oxygen?</i>

846
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:37,199
Carrie:<i> Yes!</i>
<i> That's the ultimate hostess.</i>

847
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:41,535
<i> You're offered water,</i>
<i> soft drinks, oxygen.</i>

848
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,753
- Reynolds:<i> Here.</i>
- Carrie:<i> I'm taking it.</i>

849
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,301
Carrie, muffled:

850
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,591
Freiberg:
<i> Carrie, maybe you've had</i>
<i> enough oxygen.</i>

851
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,797
- Carrie:<i> What?</i>
-<i> Maybe you've had enough.</i>

852
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,478
She seems very,
you know, coherent,

853
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,598
and she looks wonderful,
but she seems fragile.

854
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,356
And, um...

855
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,108
She's good
at seeming good.

856
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,650
- That's the thing.
- Yes, that's correct.

857
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,443
She's definitely
the lightest version

858
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:13,568
of Debbie
I've ever seen.

859
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,865
Um...

860
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,239
That would be
a good way to put it.

861
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,945
Yeah, Debbie Light.

862
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,826
<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

863
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:29,133
- ( grunting )
- Boys: Holler "uncle"!

864
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,802
( sputtering )

865
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,090
You're tuckered, Molly!
Why don't you quit?!

866
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,764
Sure, I'm tuckered,
and I might give out,
but I won't give in!

867
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,755
How could anybody
say I'm down?

868
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:41,597
Look, I'm blinking!
( spits )

869
00:42:41,643 --> 00:42:44,103
Todd:
<i> Somehow, my mother</i>
<i> is unsinkable.</i>

870
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,515
- Maybe here!
- ( shouts )

871
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,444
Todd:
<i> That "Unsinkable Molly Brown"</i>
<i> stuff is her.</i>

872
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,154
No place,
but there come a time

873
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:55,025
'cause nothing
nor nobody wants me down

874
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,823
like I wants me up!

875
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,906
Todd:
<i> The idea that my mother</i>
<i> is now older</i>

876
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,042
and she's more frail,
and I'm trying to see

877
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,949
what that feels like,
but I still don't feel it

878
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,078
because she's still
who she is inside.

879
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:07,955
<i> ( music playing )</i>

880
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,633
Todd:
<i> She went to school</i>
<i> at MGM,</i>

881
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,011
<i> where they trained you</i>
<i> how to behave,</i>

882
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,968
<i> and so it's</i>
<i> in her consciousness</i>

883
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:16,629
<i> to be at her best</i>
<i> at all times.</i>

884
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:19,468
Howdy, everybody.

885
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:21,264
Welcome.

886
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,808
Glad to see
you're here at last.

887
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:27,062
And she's a fan
before she was ever a star.

888
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,645
<i> When she went to MGM,</i>

889
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,480
<i> she was enamored</i>
<i> like anybody would be.</i>

890
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,065
<i> My God,</i>
<i> there's Clark Gable.</i>

891
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,030
And I have pictures of her
with Gary Cooper.

892
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,900
You can see she's got
stars in her eyes.

893
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,817
<i> Who wouldn't?</i>

894
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:40,406
<i> And she's still a fan</i>
<i> to this day.</i>

895
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:42,992
<i> ( applause )</i>

896
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:44,788
Oprah Winfrey:
<i> But let me just say</i>
<i> that Debbie Reynolds</i>

897
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,581
is a self-proclaimed
movie-oholic

898
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:51,745
and has an enormous Hollywood
memorabilia collection.

899
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,256
Altogether,
the costumes and props

900
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,169
are worth
millions dollars,

901
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,467
so this is sort of
your nest egg.

902
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,141
Yes, this is-- I put
all the money I could save

903
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,811
after all my husbands,
and I bought costumes.

904
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,231
This is Marilyn Monroe's
subway dress.

905
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,140
Wow.

906
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,811
Todd:
<i> My mother's passion</i>
<i> for collecting</i>

907
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,568
<i> started when they were</i>
<i> auctioning off</i>

908
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:17,110
<i> the back lots of MGM</i>
<i> and all the contents.</i>

909
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,195
<i> The idea that this stuff</i>
<i> was going to be scattered</i>

910
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,490
<i> to the four corners</i>
<i> of the Earth</i>

911
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,873
<i> was unconscionable</i>
<i> to her,</i>

912
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:26,291
<i> so she took it</i>
<i> upon herself to say,</i>
<i> "I'm going to save it."</i>

913
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:32,131
This is Liz Taylor's stool,
makeup stool from "Cleopatra."

914
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,500
This chandelier back here
is called a "girandole."

915
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:37,257
It's from "Marie Antoinette"
and "Camille."

916
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,640
In the end, she was
successful in amassing

917
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,098
the world's largest collection
of Hollywood memorabilia,

918
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:46,219
<i> and so she wanted</i>
<i> to build a museum.</i>

919
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,387
- This is from "Molly Brown."
- That's right.

920
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:50,766
Man:
<i> People are always amazed</i>
<i> when they come to Hollywood</i>

921
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,814
<i> and there's no museum</i>
<i> of film history.</i>

922
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,317
Reynolds:
<i> I've tried.</i>

923
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,189
It's just that no one seems
to be interested

924
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,146
that's in the business.

925
00:44:58,196 --> 00:45:00,906
The public,
the fans are interested,
I'm interested.

926
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:03,699
We, for decades,
struggled to build
this museum.

927
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:06,833
It was impossible to believe
that this wasn't gonna happen.

928
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:10,371
<i> But we couldn't find a partner</i>
<i> who shared her vision.</i>

929
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,167
<i> Deal after deal</i>
<i> fell through.</i>

930
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,500
- "The Wizard of Oz."
- "The Wizard of Oz."

931
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:14,785
That's Judy Garland's.

932
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,418
Chokes me up now.

933
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:18,554
You know, here we are--
we'll talk about this

934
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,631
in another 10 years,
I'll get choked up.

935
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:23,007
Nobody wants to see
their mother's heart broken,

936
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,144
and we saw it.

937
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,140
<i> When we had</i>
<i> the first two auctions,</i>

938
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:30,854
<i> it was very traumatic</i>
<i> for my mother.</i>

939
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:33,145
<i> We sold the Marilyn Monroe</i>
<i> subway dress</i>

940
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:37,399
<i> from "The Seven Year Itch"</i>
<i> for $6.2 million.</i>

941
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:40,994
<i> The truth is the collection</i>
<i> was sinking her financially.</i>

942
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,370
We had debt because
we had borrowed money
to get a lot of this stuff,

943
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,369
<i> and we don't have</i>
<i> a museum.</i>

944
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,872
<i> We were done.</i>

945
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:52,867
-<i> ( water flowing )</i>
-<i> ( birds chirping )</i>

946
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:02,804
Carrie:
<i> In one week,</i>
<i> I have to go</i>

947
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,304
<i> and start rehearsals</i>
<i> in London</i>

948
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:09,016
for "Star Wars
Seven...ty-two."

949
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:14,228
<i> I'm concerned</i>
<i> because my mother</i>
<i> is not feeling well.</i>

950
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:16,902
But I'm trying to let go.

951
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,571
It's like the--
( scoffs )

952
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,320
It's like I should be trying
to let go of my daughter

953
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,112
instead of trying
to let go of my mom.

954
00:46:24,157 --> 00:46:26,067
So, everything is backward.

955
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,075
<i> ( music playing )</i>

956
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:55,267
Carrie:
<i> My question is,</i>
<i> if you die when you're fat,</i>

957
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,233
<i> are you a fat ghost?</i>

958
00:46:57,273 --> 00:47:00,323
Or do they go back
to a flattering time?

959
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,900
So now you got
to pick it up.

960
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:04,895
I'll go to 30,
but then you have
to let me go!

961
00:47:04,948 --> 00:47:07,658
- Almost there!
- Let me go! Let my people go!

962
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,200
That's all
you're gonna get.

963
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:12,084
Oh! Okay, now cool down.
Keep it going.

964
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,581
Oh, I've been doing this
for a year.

965
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:19,674
Lucasfilm, they make them
report on my weight.

966
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,632
They take measurements.

967
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:25,884
I mean, it's--
it's intense.

968
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,677
- She loves it.
- I've learned to love it.

00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,550
Gurko:
<i>I hate to break</i>
<i>this conversation,</i>

970
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,007
but the gift
for George Lucas's daughter,

971
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,718
is it her birthday?

972
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,348
Oh, the gift.

973
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:38,436
<i> It's three months late</i>
<i> for his birthday.</i>

974
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:40,441
No, it's the birthday
of the daughter, so--

975
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,443
-<i> No, it's his. It was his.</i>
- Oh, his birthday.

976
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,725
Okay, all right.

977
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,568
<i>All right, I found</i>
<i>a place that wraps</i>

978
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,993
<i>and does</i>
<i>all the lovely things,</i>
<i>and I'll be back.</i>

( mouthing words )

980
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,617
- ( Carrie humming )
- Trainer: Forward and back.

981
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:55,253
Back.
There you go.

982
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:56,710
Shoulders.
Where are the shoulders?

983
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,959
( humming continues )
California.

984
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,132
- We're going this way.
- Even if it's a lie.

985
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,261
No, there is no way--
no, that's the one thing--

986
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,680
that is my Waterloo.

987
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:11,299
After your exercise class,

988
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:15,097
what you need to do
is smoke a cigarette.

989
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:18,143
You hear that noise, Carrie?
That's what we have to do.

990
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,477
Clear the house.

991
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,984
He's bossy.

992
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:25,476
Don't clear it today.
Clear it tomorrow.

993
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,938
Every day.

994
00:48:26,988 --> 00:48:28,398
We keep trying.

995
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,869
Here we go.

996
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,290
Gurko:
<i> So, what's on the agenda?</i>

997
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,371
Carrie:
<i> Let's go shopping.</i>

998
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:44,837
Inner health and well-being
you can now buy.

999
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:48,091
<i> How much is</i>
<i> the little watch up there?</i>

1000
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:52,604
There's a man
with his penis
and a fat woman.

1001
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,929
<i> "Prepare to meet thy God."</i>

1002
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,524
- Uh-oh. When?
- Gurko: When?

1003
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,190
Okay, and... action.

1004
00:49:01,814 --> 00:49:03,364
<i> Look at all this.</i>

1005
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:06,109
I'm having
a crisis of joy.

1006
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,074
Ooh!

1007
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:12,663
What's nice here
is the lighting.

1008
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
- Woman: Ah!
- ( laughs )

1009
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:16,914
They're doing a film.
Do you know who Debbie
Reynolds is?

1010
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,124
- Of course!
- She's my mother.

1011
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,956
- Debbie Reynolds?
- Yeah, so--

1012
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:23,461
- No.
- Yes.

1013
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,423
<i> So, you know</i>
<i> who Eddie Fisher is?</i>

1014
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,593
-<i> Of course I know Eddie--</i>
-<i> Okay, that's my father.</i>

1015
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:30,842
Oh, and I'm in "Star Wars."
You know that movie?

1016
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,125
Yes, of cour--

1017
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:34,718
I'm Princess Leia.
Yes! This.

1018
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:37,894
Oh! I need a picture!

1019
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,184
Well, you're getting
a picture, look.

1020
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,188
Look, they want--

1021
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,480
Am I getting a picture
with Princess L--

1022
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,614
take one
and then you can
send it to me.

1023
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,741
- ( humming )
- My son will go ballistic!

1024
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,660
<i> ( music playing )</i>

1025
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:04,077
Stevens:
<i> So, was it good to see</i>
<i> the "Star Wars" gang again?</i>

1026
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:07,997
Anybody you have history with,
it's interesting

1027
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,457
to see them after a while
or not--

1028
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,128
I've seen Harrison and Mark
over the years.

1029
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:15,587
You sort of run
into one another
in the cafeteria,

1030
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:18,558
the celebrity cafeteria.

1031
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,769
And they-- you know,
we all just look more melted.

1032
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,561
Stevens:
<i> Did you always want</i>
<i> to be an actress?</i>

1033
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:28,515
No, I wasn't
running around saying,
"I want to be an actress."

1034
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,858
You know, I think you got
exactly the same eyes
as your mother,

1035
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:35,494
- and your chin's
a little bit like hers, too.
- No, it isn't.

1036
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,243
I only did "Shampoo" because
I was hanging around the set,

1037
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:40,866
and they-- you know,
I mean, almost.

1038
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,793
<i> I was a type.</i>

1039
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,003
<i> That was when Debbie wanted me</i>
<i> to use the word "screw"</i>

1040
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,844
<i> instead of "fuck,"</i>

1041
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,920
<i> and Warren had to come over</i>
<i> and convince her.</i>

1042
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:55,176
Can't we just, uh,
be friends?

1043
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,394
You want to fuck?

1044
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,269
Carrie:
<i> And "Star Wars" came out</i>
<i> when I was 20.</i>

1045
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:06,060
I met Paul the next year,
and, boom.

1046
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,237
Carrie:
<i> Suddenly,</i>
<i> I'm with the people</i>

1047
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,449
<i> that are the best</i>
<i> at what they do,</i>

1048
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,660
<i> the best actors</i>
<i> and the best directors.</i>

1049
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,241
<i> And that was fun and scary</i>
<i> to be around that.</i>

1050
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:25,157
It was all a surprise.

1051
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,038
It all happened
very fast and very soon.

1052
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:31,877
Stevens:
<i> Carrie, someone's here!</i>

1053
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:33,963
Hey, fuckface!

1054
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,428
- Carrie:<i> Coming!</i>
- Where are you?!

1055
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,889
<i> ¶ I'm rooting ¶</i>

1056
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:43,060
Both:
¶ For the one I love ¶

1057
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,270
¶ To find me ¶

1058
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,692
¶ To find me ¶

1059
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,271
¶ Today ¶

1060
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,737
¶ Toda-a-y! ¶

1061
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,149
<i> ( dog barks )</i>

1062
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,157
- Oh, my God.
- Who the fuck is this?

1063
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,409
Home at last.
It's Gary, our son.

1064
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,911
Where are we going?

1065
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:05,123
We're going
into the bedroom,
as per usual.

1066
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,624
So how's the new
"Star Wars" going?

1067
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:10,077
- I'm not
allowed to answer that.
- Oh, that's right, you can't.

1068
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,747
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1069
00:52:12,797 --> 00:52:14,627
¶ Ha-a-a-a... ¶

1070
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:17,174
- Can I open them?
- Yeah.

1071
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:19,428
That's the only part
of the "Happy Birthday" song

1072
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,300
- that I've been
able to learn.
-<i> ( Dunne laughs )</i>

1073
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:23,137
That is what we sing now.

1074
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:26,732
Oh, my God.

1075
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,769
That is filthy.

1076
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,483
Look it, that's his dick
that's keeping the time.

1077
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:33,984
-<i> As it can do.</i>
- It's a second-hand dick.

1078
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:37,896
- ¶ They called me
second-hand dick ¶
- ¶ Second-hand dick. ¶

1079
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,777
- Dunne:<i> It's so beautiful.</i>
-<i> Isn't it great?</i>

1080
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,034
-<i> But I can really keep it?</i>
-<i> You can really keep it.</i>

1081
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:44,446
You know, I was thinking
it's very funny

1082
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,615
that we're running into
each other in London, too,

1083
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:49,584
because so many things
happened to us here in London.

1084
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,375
I remember
you had a boyfriend
and you were a virgin,

1085
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,051
and you didn't want him
to know you were a virgin.

1086
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,010
So I helped you out
as a friend.

1087
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,300
- He relieved me of the--
- The burden.

1088
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,635
Burden of my...

1089
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,021
- What is that called?
- Virginity.

1090
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,598
- No, no, no, but-- hymen.
- Oh, the hymen.

1091
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,354
I took the pressure
off your hymen.

1092
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,556
My hymen
was a burden to me.

1093
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,057
But that's what
a real friend does.

1094
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:16,608
- That really is.
- But it was funny.

1095
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:21,072
They always say sex--
sex can ruin a friendship,

1096
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,735
but we were young enough
where it didn't.

1097
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,954
- No, it was--
- I bet now it would.

1098
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,535
- No, it wouldn't. No.
- ( laughs )

1099
00:53:28,581 --> 00:53:30,461
Swear to God,
my mother,

1100
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:34,459
she offered for me
to have sex with
this guy Albert,

1101
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:38,633
and she would supervise...

1102
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:41,934
- Albert and I having sex.
- Actual having sex?

1103
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,799
- Actual having sex.
- Walking you through it.

1104
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:47,466
Yeah, because she apparently
has some tips on that.

1105
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:51,596
"You take the staff of life
and the grapes."

1106
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,806
- ( laughs )
- Oh, God.

1107
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,896
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>I have to tell you this.</i>

1108
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:58,902
The first time I saw test--
like, this is a tour

1109
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,195
of the first times
of genitals for me,

1110
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,108
just endless tour.

1111
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:05,737
Harry-- we all slept
in the room with them,

1112
00:54:05,785 --> 00:54:08,365
and Harry slept
in this top.

1113
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:10,582
And he would
go to the bathroom.

1114
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:13,213
So, here we go.
( whistles )

1115
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,330
- Now, we're all there.
- Oh, God.

1116
00:54:15,378 --> 00:54:17,288
Why?

1117
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,668
( whistles )

1118
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:25,927
-<i> Ugh.</i>
- And here comes Dumbo.

1119
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:27,512
<i> I'm seeing the grapes,</i>
<i> where they would be.</i>

1120
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:31,846
This angry
slather of balls.

1121
00:54:31,894 --> 00:54:33,444
( both laugh )

1122
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,399
That is a horrible story.

1123
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,689
<i>He was so awful.</i>

1124
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,783
Actually, Eddie
turns out to be one
of the better ones.

1125
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:42,990
- Oh, my God, what a bar.
- I know.

1126
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,950
You know, we can kind of
laugh and everything,

1127
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,031
but I remember
you would look forward
to seeing your father

1128
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:51,287
or talk, and he would
let you down, like,

1129
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,000
over and over
and over again.

1130
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,381
And so, I always felt like,
God, what a prick.

1131
00:54:56,419 --> 00:54:58,789
And I was so stupid
about it, though.

1132
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:01,588
Yes, you were.
And you didn't
see it coming.

1133
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,012
You were
an open-faced sandwich.

1134
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,880
Like, "Yeah,
I'm right here."

1135
00:55:04,927 --> 00:55:06,967
- There we go.
There's a good title.
- And, bam!

1136
00:55:07,013 --> 00:55:08,893
"The Open-Faced Sandwich."

1137
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:11,271
<i> But he suddenly did make</i>
<i> more appearances.</i>

1138
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,438
He came and stayed with me.
He came to me.

1139
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,598
And he said,
"I need, like,

1140
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:20,268
$5,000, $10,000

1141
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,317
for clothes."

1142
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,821
I said,
"I don't have it.

1143
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:27,953
And he went,
"You don't have it?!"

1144
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,622
And he now points
to my house.

1145
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:33,451
"You don't have it?!"

1146
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,457
And I said, "Dad...

1147
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,420
( chuckles )
...you're a singer,
not an actor.

1148
00:55:39,462 --> 00:55:41,052
Don't make a scene."

1149
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,708
At that time,
he was kind of like

1150
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,587
a guy who used to be
famous,

1151
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,683
a sort of washed-up,
you know, um...

1152
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,140
you know, lounge act.

1153
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,430
It just makes me cringe

1154
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,934
when you think about stars
that aren't stars anymore.

1155
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,517
- Yeah.
- It's humiliating.

1156
00:55:58,564 --> 00:56:01,154
Stevens:
<i> Todd, you said you could</i>

Todd:
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>

1158
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,739
¶ Oh, my papa ¶

1159
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:07,069
¶ To me, he was
so wonderful ¶

1160
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,454
¶ Never there ¶

1161
00:56:08,491 --> 00:56:10,281
¶ Oh, my papa ¶

1162
00:56:10,326 --> 00:56:12,366
¶ To me he was so dear ¶

1163
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:17,161
¶ Time and again
when he would take me
on his knee ¶

1164
00:56:17,208 --> 00:56:19,368
¶ And with a smile ¶

1165
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,748
¶ He'd change my tears
to laughter ¶

1166
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:28,508
Eddie:
<i> ¶ Oh, my papa ¶</i>

1167
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:33,682
<i> ¶ So funny,</i>
<i> so adorable... ¶</i>

1168
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,564
Todd:
<i> When Eddie left,</i>

1169
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,481
<i> I was, like, a year old.</i>

1170
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,850
One of the first times
I really connected
with my father

1171
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,358
was after I shot myself
in the leg in New York.

1172
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,150
<i> ( gunshot )</i>

1173
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:46,864
<i> It was the first time</i>
<i>I had really heard from my dad.</i>

1174
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,784
<i> He never had called me</i>
<i> before in my life.</i>

1175
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:50,663
<i> I was like,</i>
<i> "Wow, that's unusual."</i>

1176
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,699
But, you know, I had
to shoot myself in the leg

1177
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,033
to get him to make me
a call.

1178
00:56:54,078 --> 00:56:57,118
I have not been

1179
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,504
the best father
in the world.

1180
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,835
<i> I still have that guilt</i>
<i> of not putting in</i>

1181
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,970
<i> a certain amount of time</i>
<i> that I thought I should have.</i>

1182
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:12,798
<i> All I had in my head</i>
<i> for years and years</i>
<i> and years was</i>

1183
00:57:12,847 --> 00:57:16,057
making sure that I had
my drugs.

1184
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,680
<i> ( music playing )</i>

1185
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,191
Todd:
<i> Well, my dad</i>
<i> started off very early</i>

1186
00:57:26,235 --> 00:57:27,815
<i> with crystal meth.</i>

1187
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,952
<i> It all started</i>
<i> with him saying,</i>

1188
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:32,109
<i> "God, I just</i>
<i> can't do this show.</i>
<i> I'm so sick."</i>

1189
00:57:32,158 --> 00:57:34,028
<i> And this doctor</i>
<i> was there, and he said,</i>
<i> "Look, I got a shot."</i>

1190
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,946
<i> And he gave him this shot,</i>
<i> and, man, he went out there</i>

1191
00:57:35,995 --> 00:57:37,485
<i> and sung his heart out.</i>

1192
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,078
<i> And he was like,</i>
<i> "That's incredible!"</i>

1193
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:43,544
<i> He was being told</i>
<i> it was vitamin shots.</i>

1194
00:57:43,586 --> 00:57:45,916
<i> That same doctor was giving it</i>
<i> to President Kennedy</i>

1195
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,343
<i> and to J. Edgar Hoover,</i>

1196
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,171
<i> and a lot</i>
<i> of very prominent people</i>

1197
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:50,716
<i> were taking</i>
<i> these same drugs</i>

1198
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,509
<i> until everybody</i>
<i> realized what it was.</i>

1199
00:57:52,553 --> 00:57:53,933
<i> But then it's too late,</i>
<i> now, isn't it?</i>

1200
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:59,268
People that get into drugs
generally make stupid choices.

1201
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:02,520
<i> If you look at my dad's life,</i>
<i> he got stuck on stupid</i>

1202
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:04,653
<i> and ended up</i>
<i> blowing his career.</i>

1203
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,777
Carrie:
<i> Puff Daddy.</i>

1204
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:20,369
<i> You want a beverage?</i>

1205
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,044
( mutters )

1206
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,212
Carrie:
<i> My father,</i>
<i> the way that I had</i>

1207
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,631
<i> a relationship with him,</i>
<i> finally,</i>

1208
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,499
was I became his parent,

1209
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:30,957
and that was the way
to have the relationship.

1210
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:32,218
It's very important.

1211
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,719
Carrie:
<i> And so I got to know him</i>

1212
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,601
<i> as there was less</i>
<i> of him to know.</i>

1213
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,309
Was I always funny?

1214
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,807
You know what?

1215
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,692
I used to be funny
for you.

1216
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,480
'Cause I thought
if I was really funny

1217
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:51,074
that you would want
to be around me
all the time.

1218
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:55,531
I would make myself
wonderful for your return.

1219
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,824
See?
And it finally paid off.

1220
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,746
( chuckles )

1221
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,540
Carrie:
<i> I wanted to be</i>
<i> your best girl,</i>

1222
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:08,134
and that's-- I had
tough competition.

1223
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:12,455
Yeah. Well, you know,
if your competition

1224
00:59:12,508 --> 00:59:17,298
to be best girl with you
is Elizabeth Taylor,

1225
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:20,006
well, I don't think
I'm gonna do well
with that one.

1226
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:25,267
But I think I'm funnier
than Elizabeth Taylor.

1227
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,522
Anyway, that's
always been a goal.

1228
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:30,863
( chuckles )

1229
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,402
You love me?

1230
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,990
( softly )
I love you.

1231
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:45,371
You're loveable.

1232
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:55,261

Todd:
<i> So, here we are,</i>
<i> approaching the third auction</i>

1235
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:15,944
<i> of my mother's collection.</i>

1236
01:00:15,988 --> 01:00:18,568
<i> Unfortunately,</i>
<i> my mother just fell</i>

1237
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,655
<i> because she was dizzy</i>
<i> walking into her bathroom.</i>

1238
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,042
When we saw her,
we were all in horror

1239
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,078
because we were like,
"Wait a minute.

1240
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,662
You know, you could
have broke your neck
or be dead right now."

1241
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,498
I fainted.

1242
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:32,343
I went plummeting
to the ground.

1243
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:35,629
And I hit a rock or--
you know, in my bathroom.

1244
01:00:35,674 --> 01:00:37,884
And it was
12:00 at night,

1245
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:41,136
and it just bruised
everything.

1246
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:44,720
But-- I know, I'll do
the interview like this!

1247
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,733
Todd:
<i> But the subject</i>
<i> never came up</i>

<i> to cancel the auction.</i>

01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,518
<i> You know, I suspect</i>
<i> she's going to show up</i>

01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,395
<i> to the parties</i>
<i> and act like</i>

so well.

Oh, this is murder.

I'm wondering now,
you're about to be
done with the third--

01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,667
Final.
It's the end
of an era,

We are always

We have red carpets

our homes.

My mom, she's having
second thoughts

costumes.

1277
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:57,626
<i> She said, "I think</i>
<i> I want to keep them."</i>

1278

<i> She personally collected</i>
<i> these outfits.</i>

01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,005
Debbie went
to Peter Lawford.

1280
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,932
And he was like,
"Why in the hell do you want

1281

and my outfit?"

1282

<i> And she's like,</i>
<i> "I want the whole ensemble,</i>

1283
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,559
<i> and I want it</i>
<i> for the museum.</i>

01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,107
I say it's someone
speaking to me,

01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:21,401
that I should not
sell the boys.

1288
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:27,407
¶ And all at once
it seems so nice ¶

1293
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,719

about it,

1295
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:47,426

01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,494
<i> selling for $27,500.</i>

1320
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:00,461
The dog will not leave,

1321
01:04:00,504 --> 01:04:02,804
so do you want him
to lie down?

1322
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,839
Stevens:
<i> Um, he's okay there.</i>

1323
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,843
Reynolds:
But I'm gonna sort of face
that way a little bit.

1324
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,966
'Cause I just--
I look so bad.

1325
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:11,763
I don't want
to face direct.

1326
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:13,767
Stevens:
<i> No, you're gonna</i>
<i> talk to me...</i>

1327
01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,059
- Oh, good, good.
- ...but I was gonna
stand right here.

1328
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,693
Now...

1329
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:21,109
is the hair in one place?

1330
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:23,149
- Stevens:<i> The hair?</i>
- It's one place.

1331
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:24,943
Okay, there we are.

1332
01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:26,857
Stevens:
<i> The hair looks very good.</i>

1333
01:04:26,905 --> 01:04:29,065
<i> Okay, how are you--</i>
<i> by the way, how are</i>
<i> you doing?</i>

1334
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:32,736
Well, it's not my best day,
but that's all right

1335
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,996
because we've had
other days that are worse.

1336
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,158
Have we?

1337
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:38,116
I'm happy to be here.

1338
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,076
<i> First thing I want</i>
<i> to ask you about</i>

1339
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,207
<i> is how many years were</i>
<i> you under contract at MGM?</i>

1340
01:04:42,254 --> 01:04:48,174
I was at MGM
from 1948...

1341
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,548
through
"How the West Was Won."

1342
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,966
We made a lot
of pictures at MGM,

1343
01:04:53,015 --> 01:04:54,555
and I had
a wonderful time.

1344
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,850
I had a wonderful time.

1345
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,062
I had... youth,
you know.

1346
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:01,023
I had--
I was just a kid.

1347
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:02,734
I didn't know anything,

1348
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,774
and they taught me
everything.

1349
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:08,238
<i> Can we talk a little bit</i>
<i> about your brother</i>

1350
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,570
<i> and just a little bit</i>
<i> about Texas?</i>

1351
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,236
-<i> Because, um...</i>
- If you like.

1352
01:05:12,284 --> 01:05:13,244
-<i> Is that okay?</i>
- Sure.

1353
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:14,485
<i> Oh, hi, Carrie!</i>

1354
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:16,826
¶ I'm not here. ¶

1355
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:20,287
Reynolds:
<i> You're going?</i>

1356
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,674
<i>I'm going.</i>

1357
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:22,710
Go to bed.

1358
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:24,463
Yes, go to bed.

1359
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,174
<i> Say good night</i>
<i> to everybody.</i>

1360
01:05:26,214 --> 01:05:28,304
Good night
to everybody.

1361
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:30,132
Stevens:
<i> Will you come back</i>
<i> and visit us?</i>

1362
01:05:30,177 --> 01:05:32,837
Reynolds:
<i> No, no, no.</i>
<i> She's got to go to bed.</i>

1363
01:05:32,888 --> 01:05:34,008
( mouthing words )

1364
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:35,596
( chuckles )

1365
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:36,931
<i>( alarm blaring )</i>

1366
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,555
Stevens:
Oh, no! Oh, no!

1367
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:41,522
( laughing ) The alarm!
She's locked in now!

1368
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,945
Wait, Carrie!

1369
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,410
I have no idea
what the alarm is.

1370
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,241
Carrie:
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1371
01:05:56,286 --> 01:05:57,986
<i> ( alarm continues )</i>

1372
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:01,538
I-I have no--
I have no idea...

1373
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,873
Oh, my God.

1374
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:04,918
Now the police
with come?

1375
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,251
I suppose.

1376
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,456
Michael?

1377
01:06:07,506 --> 01:06:11,926
Try 985-3193
or something.

1378
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:15,428
I don't remember ever...

1379
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:19,642
I don't remember ever,
ever turning this alarm on.

1380
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:22,845
<i> ¶</i> Just one
<i> of those things ¶</i>

1381
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:25,436
¶ Just one of those
fabulous things. ¶

1382
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:26,982
It wasn't my day.

1383
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:30,395
-<i> ( alarm continues )</i>
- ( dog barks )

1384
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:31,895
- ( alarm stops )
- Stevens:<i> That's it!</i>

1385
01:06:31,947 --> 01:06:33,817
-<i> Yay! ( clapping )</i>
- Carrie:<i> Ohh!</i>

1386
01:06:36,952 --> 01:06:39,122
Stevens:<i> Debbie,</i>
<i> while you're here,</i>

1387
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:42,412
<i> can you just tell us</i>
<i> about the shoes and stuff?</i>

1388
01:06:42,457 --> 01:06:43,667
Okay.

1389
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:45,629
<i> This is Judy Garland's shoe.</i>

1390
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:50,129
Well, was, of course.

1391
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,013
They look small,
don't they?

1392
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,760
Stevens:
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

1393
01:06:53,802 --> 01:06:55,142
They would fit me.

1394
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:56,178
<i> Do you think</i>
<i> they fit you now?</i>

1395
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,601
She wore 5 1/2.

1396
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,021
Stevens:
<i> I'll get that for you.</i>

1397
01:07:01,059 --> 01:07:02,929
- Sorry.
- Man:<i> Okay.</i>

1398
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:04,938
I think we should end it
at the end of this.

1399
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:06,560
Man:
<i> Okay, yeah.</i>

1400
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,606
'Cause I think
everything's going wrong.

1401
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:11,281
Okay.

1402
01:07:11,319 --> 01:07:13,609
And this...

1403
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,235
is...

1404
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:18,582
¶ We're off
to see the Wizard ¶

1405
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,868
¶ The wonderful
Wizard of Oz. ¶

1406
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:23,252
Thank you.
Thank you.

1407
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,540
Thank you.

1408
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:27,171
Thank you.

1409
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:30,546
( kisses )

1410
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:36,966
Chaplin.

1411
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:40,967
Come on.

1412
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:41,926
Come on.

1413
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,265
Stevens:
<i> Thanks, Debbie.</i>

1414
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:44,520
- Come on.
- Stevens:<i> You got it?</i>

1415
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:45,851
Man:
<i> Mm-hmm.</i>

1416
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,406
<i> ( dog barks )</i>

1417
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,069
Carrie:
<i> Dwight!</i>

1418
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,367
Do you want to go
to Vegas?

1419
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,951
I know Dwight does.

1420
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:06,366
Dwight always wants
to go to Vegas.

1421
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,996
And they get
very excited.

1422
01:08:08,043 --> 01:08:10,043
Come on, it's hard
to take both of them.

1423
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,206
<i> Come on, Dwig.</i>

1424
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:16,047
Carrie:
<i> We are going to do Vegas</i>

1425
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,682
with my mother.

1426
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:21,049
I didn't know it
until my daughter told me.

1427
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:22,597
<i> It's absurd.</i>

1428
01:08:22,641 --> 01:08:24,351
<i> If you're going</i>
<i> to retire, you retire.</i>

1429
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:27,442
She retires and books
an engagement in Vegas,

1430
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,439
and then says,
"Come help me."

1431
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:32,191
I don't believe that
that's the last one.

1432
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,066
<i> ( sirens wailing )</i>

1433
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,782
Carrie:
<i> This is all against</i>

1434
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:39,953
doctor's orders, now,

1435
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:43,541
as if any orders
apply to Debbie.

1436
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:48,748
But everyone ends up
in Vegas.

1437
01:08:50,418 --> 01:08:52,918
<i> You know,</i>
<i> if my mother's unhappy,</i>

1438
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,633
it lives on my grid,

1439
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:57,423
so I both want to

1440
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,087
and have to
help my mother.

1441
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,769
<i> She was very good</i>
<i> to her mother,</i>

1442
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,769
and her mother
didn't deserve it.

1443
01:09:09,271 --> 01:09:10,731
Debbie deserves it.

1444
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,443
<i> ( projector whirring )</i>

1445
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,694
Carrie:
<i> When Debbie</i>
<i> got into show business,</i>

1446
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:18,566
<i> obviously it was</i>
<i> a big difference</i>
<i> in your lives,</i>

1447
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:20,243
<i> but did you like it?</i>

1448
01:09:20,282 --> 01:09:22,782
Maxine Reynolds:
<i> Mm-mm. I think it's phony.</i>

1449
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:25,656
Your mother never knew
what it was,

1450
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,584
and we went in blind.

1451
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:29,412
And did you encourage her
to go in?

1452
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:32,747
No. In fact, I've tried
to get her out of it.
( laughing )

1453
01:09:32,794 --> 01:09:35,044
What did Grandpa think
of show business?

1454
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:37,458
<i> Eh, he thought</i>
<i> it was a crazy way</i>
<i> to make a living.</i>

1455
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,087
<i> ( chuckling )</i>

1456
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:41,344
<i>Well, what do you wish</i>
<i>that she would have done?</i>

1457
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:44,096
<i> She wanted</i>
<i> to be a gym teacher.</i>
<i> You know that.</i>

1458
01:09:44,139 --> 01:09:46,389
<i>You think she would have</i>
<i>been happier doing that?</i>

1459
01:09:46,433 --> 01:09:48,523
<i> I think it would have</i>
<i> been more normal.</i>

1460
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:51,140
<i> But she loves</i>
<i> what she's doing,</i>
<i> let's face it.</i>

1461
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,017
<i> Loved it all,</i>
<i> and still does.</i>

1462
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:54,774
- Carrie:<i> Yeah, she does.</i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

1463
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,896
God gave her brains,
but He didn't put 'em
up here,

1464
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:58,363
He put 'em
down in her ankles.

1465
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:11,463
This is the view
of the whole--
this is Vegas.

1466
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:15,748
<i> I've been coming here</i>
<i> since the '60s,</i>

1467
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:19,335
<i> but this will be</i>
<i> probably the finale.</i>

1468
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,632
I'm not feeling
that well,

1469
01:10:21,676 --> 01:10:26,846
and so, to be well enough
to do my whole show,

1470
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:32,190
I asked my children
if they would come up
and relieve me.

1471
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,984
Carrie:
<i> "Carrie says, 'Mother,</i>

1472
01:10:36,024 --> 01:10:38,404
<i> you know</i>
<i> I started in your act</i>

1473
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,153
at 14 years of age."

1474
01:10:40,195 --> 01:10:41,685
Who talks like that?

1475
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:45,778
"Todd comes onstage
and the family banters."

1476
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:47,445
I don't want
to make fun of it,

1477
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,744
'cause it's sweet
and she wrote this.

1478
01:10:49,788 --> 01:10:53,288
Then she sings
"This is a Lovely Way
to Spend an Evening"

1479
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:54,713
and "Tammy."

1480
01:10:56,628 --> 01:10:59,048
<i> I hope</i>
<i> it works out well.</i>

1481
01:10:59,089 --> 01:11:03,589
And the song
that she's picked,
for me-- perfect.

1482
01:11:03,635 --> 01:11:08,425
¶ I'll never say no
to you ¶

1483
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:12,683
¶ Whatever you say,
I'll do ¶

1484
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:18,607
¶ If you ask me to wait
for a lifetime ¶

You can't push her

you can't have that.

Todd:
You're getting the Lifetime
Achievement Award.

Life-- well,
that's the thing, see?

1752
01:25:03,974 --> 01:25:06,564
I get upset, so I can't
remember anything.

1753
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,892
It's an achievement
that you even got here.

1754
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:10,558
Todd:
That's the real
achievement.

1755

- Todd: But it's on
the prompter.

1759
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:19,609
Carrie, was the prompter
big enough?

1760
01:25:19,657 --> 01:25:20,947
The prompter is huge.

1761
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,281
I just want to know
what it is.

1762
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,116
Like, in real life

have to say it,

<i>No, it is.</i>
<i>It's the biggest honor.</i>

Todd:
Do you have enough air
on you back there?

1782
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,956
You know, you keep
asking me questions.

1783
01:26:13,002 --> 01:26:16,342
- Did you--?
- I don't need
any questions.

1784
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,510
Don't ask you questions.
Okay.

Carrie's flipping out.

01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,944
( mouthing words )

1820
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,685
- Reynolds:
Thank you. Thank you.
- ( cheering )

1821
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:05,737
I want to thank
the Screen Actors Guild

1822
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,071
for awarding me
with this tonight.

1823
01:28:08,117 --> 01:28:09,777
It's very unexpected.

1824
01:28:09,827 --> 01:28:11,657
And, you know, I've been
in the business now...

1825
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:14,754
( deep breath )
...66 years.

1826
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,710
And, uh, my favorite movie
was "Singin' in the Rain."

1827
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:20,962
Well, I did mention--
did I say that? Yeah.

1828
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:23,255
And I had a good time
making that picture,

1829
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:25,008
wearing myself out.

1830
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,510
God gave us talent,
so we're very fortunate.

1831
01:28:27,553 --> 01:28:28,763
We all are.

1832
01:28:28,804 --> 01:28:30,514
What we do best,
believe in it.

1833
01:28:30,556 --> 01:28:32,556
And of course, we--
we do that of course,

1834
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:35,769
and my favorite movie was
"The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"

1835
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:38,101
and I had a lot of fun
doing that.

1836
01:28:38,147 --> 01:28:39,147
-<i> ( applause )</i>
- Thank you.

1837
01:28:39,189 --> 01:28:41,149
In that movie,
I got to sing

1838
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,901
a wonderful film--
uh, song,

1839
01:28:43,944 --> 01:28:47,114
called, uh,
"I Ain't Down Yet."

1840
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:49,406
- Well, I ain't.
- ( chuckles )

1841
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,580
Thank you all very much
for this wonderful award.

1842
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,199
<i> ( cheering and applause )</i>

1843
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:55,996
-<i> ( music playing )</i>
- Thank you.

1844
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:02,040
Announcer:
<i> Coming up-- Ethan Hawke,</i>

1845
01:29:02,087 --> 01:29:05,757
<i> Patricia Arquette,</i>
<i> Rashida Jones, Andy Samberg,</i>

1846
01:29:05,799 --> 01:29:08,969
<i> and, with a special tribute,</i>
<i> Liev Schreiber.</i>

1847
01:29:17,978 --> 01:29:19,058
( chatter )

1848
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,944
- How was it?
- It was fine.

1849
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:23,441
- Fine.
- Were you nervous
at all up there?

1850
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:27,244
- Um, yes, but not for--
- I was nervous. I was nervous!

1851
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:28,529
When did you not
get nervous?

1852
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,862
You seemed like
you settled down.

1853
01:29:29,907 --> 01:29:31,447
Well, no,
it wasn't that I--

1854
01:29:31,492 --> 01:29:33,782
the whole evening,
to me, was wonderful.

1855
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:37,157
And there's no business
like show business.

1856
01:29:37,206 --> 01:29:38,536
- Tonight--
- You know what?

1857
01:29:38,582 --> 01:29:40,122
I have to say
something.

1858
01:29:40,167 --> 01:29:44,457
Everything about it
is appealing.

1859
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:45,955
( laughter )

1860
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:48,216
Something that
the traffic will applaud.

1861
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:50,088
Everything.
No, seriously,
everything,

1862
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:51,835
well, the traffic
will allow.

1863
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,347
- Nowhere can you get...
- Woman:<i> That happy feeling.</i>

1864
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,099
When you're stealing--

1865
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,521
and I don't mean, you know,
out-and-out stealing...

1866
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,810
An extra bow.

1867
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:01,443
Extra bow.

1868
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:03,190
But there's no people
like show people.

1869
01:30:03,232 --> 01:30:05,442
There are people
like show people.

1870
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:07,114
- Nah, it's true.
- Now, that's true.

1871
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,032
Well, the smiling
when they're low...

1872
01:30:09,071 --> 01:30:11,911
- ...us schizophrenics
are like that.
- Oh, really?

1873
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:14,369
- So, they're
like show people.
- Reynolds: Really?

1874
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:18,619
If they offered you another
Life Achievement Award,
would you do it?

1875
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:21,464
Now, I can't be funny
about tonight.

1876
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,290
It's too special.

1877
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:24,955
- Okay.
- It was a special night.

1878
01:30:25,003 --> 01:30:26,463
But that was
a good question, though.

1879
01:30:26,505 --> 01:30:28,625
Could you handle another
life achievement award?

1880
01:30:28,674 --> 01:30:30,224
'Cause they're gonna see
that you did one,

1881
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,629
and they're gonna
want to do--

1882
01:30:31,677 --> 01:30:32,877
That's right,
the floodgates are open.

1883
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,718
I can't answer it,
because...

1884
01:30:34,763 --> 01:30:36,303
it's too special,

1885
01:30:36,348 --> 01:30:38,428
and I won't
be here then.

1886
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,345
I will have gone on.

1887
01:30:40,394 --> 01:30:41,984
So it's very important
for this moment--

1888
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:43,650
For the<i> big</i>
life achievement.

1889
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,399
( chuckles )

1890
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,820
You don't get a chance

1891
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:50,240
to have a moment
like this very often.

1892
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,399
It's not like any moment.

1893
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,487
It's its own special moment.

1894
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:56,413
<i> ( chatter )</i>

1895
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,411

1897
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:02,785
¶ The man
that won you... ¶

1898
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,003
"Has run off
and undone you."

1899
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:06,212
¶ Has run off
and undone you ¶

1900
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:09,253
- "The great beginning."
- ¶ The great beginning ¶

1901
01:31:09,298 --> 01:31:12,588
- "Has seen a final ending."
- ¶ Has seen a final ending ¶

1902
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,934
- "Don't know what happened."
- ¶ Don't know what happened ¶

1903
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:22,481
- "It's all a crazy game."
- ¶ It's all a crazy game ¶

1904
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:25,979
Yeah! "Ever since
this world began."

1905
01:31:26,023 --> 01:31:28,693
¶ Ever since
this world began... ¶

Carrie:

1907
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,486

Debbie:
<i> Say good night, George.</i>

1909
01:31:35,032 --> 01:31:36,362
<i> Can't you say,</i>
<i> "Good night, George,"</i>

1910
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,868
<i> and I'll say,</i>
<i> "Good night, Gracie"?</i>

1911
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:39,740
Carrie:
<i> That's not original, Mother.</i>

1912
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:41,116
Reynolds:
<i> Oh, I know,</i>
<i> but it shouldn't be.</i>

1913
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:42,543
<i> It should be</i>
<i> just simply funny.</i>

1914
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:44,081
<i> It's slightly amusing</i>
<i> to you.</i>

1915

Carrie:
<i> Why continue</i>

1916
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:47,079
Reynolds:

1917

<i> Good night,</i>

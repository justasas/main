1
00:01:29,905 --> 00:01:31,343
Thank you, madame.

2
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:35,129
Good morning, monsieur.

3
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,324
- Some nice fresh...

4
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:37,911
- There it is.
- I need some onions.

5
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:40,606
- Delivered this morning.
Pick them out yourself.

6
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,656
- How are the peaches?

7
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:43,873
- Eh, the peaches?
Wonderful.

8
00:01:43,908 --> 00:01:45,624
I ate one this morning,
and I never tasted...

9
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,082
- Uh, can I help you?
- Merci.

10
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,753
- Please, monsieur,

11
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:50,758
be careful with the peaches.
- Yes.

12
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:53,081
There are some
wonderful plums, monsieur.

13
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,253
If you can't use the plums, then...
- Uh..huh.

14
00:01:58,892 --> 00:01:59,887
- One kilo is enough.

15
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:02,789
- A kilo and a half, monsieur.
Put it on the scale yourself.

16
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:03,725
- One kilo.

17
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:05,254
- Monsieur, string beans?

18
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,711
And there's some lovely carrots
fresh this morning.

19
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:09,797
- We need some butter.
There's a dairy down there.

20
00:02:09,832 --> 00:02:11,143
- Monsieur, my money, please.

21
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,380
Pay for it.

22
00:02:12,843 --> 00:02:14,358
Uh, excuse me.

23
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,386
I'm looking for the shop
of Mr. Godet, the baker.

24
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,502
We just arrived in town.
Ask the woman.

25
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,077
- Fresh this morning.
Taste one.

26
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:24,401
Excuse me, please.
Number 26.

27
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,539
There, 3 doors down.

28
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:26,642
- They are sour.

29
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,637
- Uh, monsieur, because you're
a nice gentleman...

30
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,472
- here, monsieur... especially because you
are a nice gentleman...

31
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:30,369
Oh. Please, monsieur.

32
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:33,034
I'm looking for Mr. Godet, the baker.

33
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:35,198
Dead.
Died a month ago.

34
00:03:35,233 --> 00:03:36,175
Oh.

35
00:03:37,448 --> 00:03:38,430
What a pity.

36
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:39,412
You know him?

37
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,749
No, my father knew him.

38
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:42,598
Mm-hmm.

39
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,058
And Mr. Godet's wife?

40
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,447
Oh, she took the children
and moved to Marseilles
to her brother.

41
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:50,801
Tell your father
that the brother's name
is Pastin in Marseilles.

42
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,701
My...my father's dead.

43
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:56,335
Oh.

44
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:01,638
You see, my father told me
that his old friend, Mr. Godet

45
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,028
would someday help me,

46
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:06,533
So when my father was dead
and there was nobody there,

47
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:09,380
I wrote him a letter,
to Mr. Godet.

48
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,033
And I packed my things and left.

49
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:14,285
And I thought Mr. Godet would
be expecting me.

50
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,744
Oh.

51
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,892
I see.

52
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,072
You, uh...have no family?

53
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:24,832
Where will you go?

54
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,787
You have any money?

55
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:31,978
Well, I thought Mr. Godet
would let me work for him

56
00:04:32,013 --> 00:04:34,220
in his bakery, perhaps.

57
00:04:35,425 --> 00:04:37,090
I'm very strong, you know?

58
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:38,303
I'm a hard worker.

59
00:04:38,338 --> 00:04:41,136
I can work very hard
without getting a bit tired.

60
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:41,941
Hmm.

61
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:44,718
Come in.

62
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,205
Come in. Come in.
Come in.

63
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:50,406
Have you eaten?

64
00:04:51,694 --> 00:04:52,974
Not...not today,

65
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:54,193
Hmm.

66
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:55,770
Perhaps a little bread?

67
00:04:55,771 --> 00:04:57,007
Oh.

68
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,400
Come on.

69
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:01,299
A little cheese, maybe, huh?

70
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:02,204
Thank you.

71
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,797
And, uh...a little wine.

72
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:05,640
Oh, thank you.

73
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:06,413
Thank you.

74
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:07,682
In here. In here.

75
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:08,917
That's it. Ha ha.

76
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,495
Now, perhaps you
will work for me, eh?

77
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,284
Of course, you understand
I can't pay you while you learn,

78
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,788
but you'll have a nice bed to sleep in
and a stove to cook a little supper,

79
00:05:20,628 --> 00:05:26,678
and in the morning, you will open the shop
and sell a few buttons and pins and, uh...

80
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:29,941
be my little helper, huh?

81
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:32,057
Huh?

82
00:05:33,609 --> 00:05:36,241
Hmm. I'm going in here.

83
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,997
Paul, will you get me a bottle
of pinot in the wine shop?

84
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,055
[  Shopkeeper  ]
I'm not going to hurt you.

85
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,905
[  Lili  ]  I want to go.

86
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,099
- Oh, no. Come here.
- Please, I want to go.

87
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,352
- Please.
- Oh, no, no, no.

88
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:50,167
- I am not going to hurt you.

89
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:51,947
- I'm telling you, I want to go.

90
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:53,281
- I want to go.

91
00:05:53,316 --> 00:05:54,546
- No, wait.

92
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:55,402
- Don't be afraid.

93
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:56,891
Oh. Yes, monsieur?

94
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,203
May I be of service, monsieur?

95
00:05:58,238 --> 00:05:59,445
A little trouble with my helper.

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,711
Very difficult to find good help
these days.

97
00:06:01,746 --> 00:06:03,779
- They're lazy and stupid.
- And uncooperative.

98
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,509
- How much?
- 90 please, monsieur.

99
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:06,774
70.
I want half a dozen.

100
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,665
85.
What are you
standing there for?

101
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,275
You can get out.

102
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,355
I take her off the streets,

103
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,240
a girl with no references,
no family, no money,

104
00:06:13,275 --> 00:06:14,472
and...colors, monsieur...

105
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,915
and I give her place to sleep
and food to eat

106
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,854
and a fine opportunity
to learn a trade.

107
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:19,731
And what happens?

108
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:20,574
Nothing, I hope.

109
00:06:20,674 --> 00:06:21,433
75.

110
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:22,419
Uh, 80.

111
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,067
She breaks my pitcher
and eats my food.

112
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:26,298
- I didn't...

113
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:27,373
- I didn't eat anything.

114
00:06:27,408 --> 00:06:28,706
- I was going to eat, but he...

115
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:29,706
You're through.
Good-bye.

116
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:31,504
What are you waiting for?

117
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,394
But my suitcase in there

118
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:35,249
and my hat and my purse.

119
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:39,107
Your face is dirty, little mouse.

120
00:06:40,104 --> 00:06:41,848
There is nothing
to cry about.

121
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,726
You should be happy
to leave this place.

122
00:06:45,116 --> 00:06:45,980
It smells.

123
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,310
Does he owe you
any wages?

124
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:49,440
- Wages?
For what?

125
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,006
She should pay me
for the food she ate.

126
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:52,355
Ah?

127
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,371
My word of honor, monsieur,
I didn't eat a bite. Not a bite.

128
00:06:56,406 --> 00:06:57,503
All right, all right, look...

129
00:06:58,602 --> 00:06:59,799
Hup!
See?

130
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,376
It's right behind your ear.

131
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:02,706
No, this one.

132
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:04,879
See?

133
00:07:06,553 --> 00:07:08,022
It's a trick?

134
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,391
Now, how did you know?

135
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:13,535
Everything is all right now,
hmm?

136
00:07:14,952 --> 00:07:15,865
What's your name?

137
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,856
Marc.

138
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:19,207
Marcus.

139
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,796
Marcus the magnificent.

140
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:24,116
It suits you.

141
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,000
- Enough!

142
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:26,082
OUT!

143
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:29,180
Mademoiselle.

144
00:07:29,237 --> 00:07:30,540
Thank you, monsieur.

145
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,844
Farewell, mademoiselle.

146
00:07:32,584 --> 00:07:33,819
Be of good cheer.

147
00:07:34,482 --> 00:07:35,516
You are young.

148
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,035
It's a fine day.

149
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,272
And tomorrow
will be another.

150
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,838
- Six handkerchiefs
at 80 francs.

151
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:45,164
75.

152
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:48,094
A good day to you, sir.

153
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,196
Where's Marc?

154
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,584
He went in there a minute.

155
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,356
Here's your wine.
Pay you tomorrow.

156
00:08:17,812 --> 00:08:18,551
- What's that?

157
00:08:19,555 --> 00:08:20,587
- She lost her job.

158
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:23,168
- No money, no family,
no place to go.

159
00:08:23,245 --> 00:08:24,842
- She seems to be
going with you.

160
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,144
- Oh, no.

161
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,897
Where are you going?

162
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,272
- Uh, what, monsieur?

163
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,535
- Where do you live?

164
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,017
- Uh...uh...where do you live?

165
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:35,923
- Ha.
Where do we live?

166
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,690
- Everywhere.

167
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,216
Last week, Marseilles.

168
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,558
The week before, Avignon.

169
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,284
Next week, Aix-les-Bains.

170
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:42,712
- Huh.
You...you travel.

171
00:08:42,747 --> 00:08:43,976
How pleasant.

172
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:45,930
- Who is she?
Where did you find her?

173
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,052
- She loves me.

174
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:48,941
- What's your name?

175
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,223
- Lilette Daurier.

176
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:52,701
But my father always
called me Lili.

177
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:54,594
- Let me give you
a word of advice, Lili.

178
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,616
Find someone else to love.

179
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:58,325
This Marc is dangerous.

180
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:01,608
He's got an assistant
with long, red fingernails.

181
00:09:01,643 --> 00:09:03,709
Ha.
Such men are dangerous.

182
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:06,782
- Hey, listen,

injured in the war.

Look at her, Paul.
Isn't she pretty?

Well, say something, you...

Oh, yes, of course.

Lili, go wait for us a minute.
We'll have lunch in the tent.

So, the awkward child is becoming
an attractive dish,

and you don't like it,

745
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:22,396
because from now on,
there's gonna be competition.

746
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,098
I don't know what
you're talking about.

At times.

What the devil
is the matter with you?

752
00:49:34,487 --> 00:49:35,604
You're in love with the girl,

753

and she's in love
with someone else.

754

This sort of thing
happens all the time.

You'll recover...

but meanwhile, can't you be
civilized about it?

758
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:50,276
I'll try.

759
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,433
Come on.
Let's go to lunch.

760

Why not?

802
00:51:49,255 --> 00:51:50,791
Because he didn't ask her.

Well, an experienced woman
knows how to make the man ask her.

804
00:51:54,013 --> 00:51:55,021
Ask her what?

805

- [ Reynardo ]
That depends.

Now, what do you
want him to ask you?

It wasn't so bad

when you were mad about
women who didn't count.

835

You are well enough
established now,

You don't have to dangle yourself
in front of these women.

1075
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,349
but you want to know
something, Marc?

1076
01:04:15,173 --> 01:04:18,153
We sometimes outgrow
feelings and ideas,

1077
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:21,471
just like a little girl
outgrows her dresses,

1078
01:04:22,313 --> 01:04:27,159
but somehow, it turns out that
there's a right time for everything...

1079
01:04:27,716 --> 01:04:29,103
in the right order.

1080
01:04:29,895 --> 01:04:33,331
There's a time for going to school.

1081
01:04:34,427 --> 01:04:36,498
A time for losing our parents,

1082
01:04:38,063 --> 01:04:42,592
and a time for falling in love
with a beautiful magician.

1083
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,648
But there's a time for waking up.

1084
01:04:49,779 --> 01:04:53,514
You are a wise girl...Lili.

1085
01:04:53,797 --> 01:04:55,331
Where did you learn all this?

1086
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:57,384
We don't learn.

1087
01:04:58,047 --> 01:04:59,724
We just get older...

1088
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:01,454
and we know.

1089
01:05:04,815 --> 01:05:05,861
Good-bye, Marc.

1090
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:08,489
Good-bye.

1091
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:12,897
Thank you for your patience.

1092
01:05:14,482 --> 01:05:17,851
Forgive me for having been
such a nuisance.

1093
01:05:27,726 --> 01:05:29,618
Oh, Rosalie,

1094
01:05:30,496 --> 01:05:31,822
I'm...I'm leaving.

1095
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:34,306
I just said good-bye
to your husband.

1096
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:35,424
Good-bye.

1097
01:05:48,106 --> 01:05:49,044
Lili?

1098
01:05:49,536 --> 01:05:51,778
Oh, Lili, please, wait a minute.

1099
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:55,630
Are you gonna leave
without saying good-bye?

1100
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:59,425
Please, Lili, just for a minute,
come here.

1101
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,817
Please? Closer.

1102
01:06:04,134 --> 01:06:06,053
I have a favor to ask, and

1103
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:08,915
I don't want the others to hear.

1104
01:06:11,399 --> 01:06:14,921
If you're leaving, Lili,
please take me with you.

1105
01:06:15,568 --> 01:06:18,886
I wanna go with you,
wherever you go.

1106
01:06:19,289 --> 01:06:21,782
It won't be the same
here without you.

1107
01:06:23,789 --> 01:06:25,880
You're my sweetheart, you see?

1108
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:28,427
It was love at first sight.

1109
01:06:29,273 --> 01:06:33,670
From the first moment I saw you
walking by, wearing that... awful hat,

1110
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,790
and carrying that lopsided suitcase.

1111
01:06:37,123 --> 01:06:40,713
- Please...oh, please don't
leave us, Lili!

1112
01:06:41,017 --> 01:06:44,314
I never had a real friend
until you came along.

1113
01:06:44,564 --> 01:06:46,154
Please take me with you.

1114
01:06:46,728 --> 01:06:48,773
If you really loved us,
you wouldn't go away.

1115
01:06:48,808 --> 01:06:49,678
Oh, but I do.

1116
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:50,922
It's just that I...

1117
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:52,109
I'll say it.

1118
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:53,734
You hate the boss.

1119
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,365
He's unreasonable.

1120
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:56,459
He's mean.

1121
01:06:56,494 --> 01:06:57,517
He's jealous.

1122
01:06:57,598 --> 01:06:59,277
We'll protect you from him.

1123
01:06:59,292 --> 01:07:00,334
Oh, you always have.

1124
01:07:00,956 --> 01:07:03,040
You've always been
so kind and good...

1125
01:07:04,028 --> 01:07:07,340
- and you seem to know
what's in my heart or

1126
01:07:07,375 --> 01:07:10,652
- what I'm thinking
and what I'm feeling.

1127
01:07:14,692 --> 01:07:15,467
I'll kill him!

1128
01:07:15,651 --> 01:07:19,350
I'm gonna kill the boss! Grrr!

1129
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:23,319
Well, anyway, I'll give him
a good talking to.

1130
01:07:23,568 --> 01:07:24,828
Hey, boss...

1131
01:07:25,028 --> 01:07:25,938
- Lili?

1132
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:27,708
Here.

1133
01:07:27,946 --> 01:07:29,956
It's our going-away present.

1134
01:07:30,193 --> 01:07:33,741
Oh, Reynardo...how very nice.

1135
01:07:33,797 --> 01:07:35,430
It was very expensive.

1136
01:07:35,581 --> 01:07:38,309
He probably stole it.
You know Reynardo.

1137
01:07:38,604 --> 01:07:40,309
How did you get it, Reynardo?

1138
01:07:40,344 --> 01:07:42,078
Well, must I tell?

1139
01:07:43,116 --> 01:07:45,802
Reynardo, you promised me
you would never steal again.

1140
01:07:45,837 --> 01:07:47,760
I didn't steal it.

1141
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:51,512
If you must know, I'm paying for it
on the installment plan.

1142
01:07:51,547 --> 01:07:53,342
What happens if you don't
keep up with the payments?

1143
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,750
I know him.
He'll never keep up.

1144
01:07:55,829 --> 01:07:57,165
They'll come and
take it away from you.

1145
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,709
No, they won't.
I made a deal.

1146
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:02,116
What sort of a deal?

1147
01:08:02,324 --> 01:08:05,141
Well, I agreed that if I didn't
keep up with the payments,

1148
01:08:05,176 --> 01:08:07,180
I'd give the man something
else in exchange.

1149
01:08:07,215 --> 01:08:08,774
I signed a paper.

1150
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:10,690
Uh-oh.
He signed a paper.

1151
01:08:10,725 --> 01:08:12,762
What does the man
get in exchange?

1152
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:14,679
Another fox fur.

1153
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:16,114
Another?

1154
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:17,050
Uh-huh...

1155
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:19,457
me.

1156
01:08:20,382 --> 01:08:22,068
Well, you poor darling.

1157
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:23,720
- You traded your life

1158
01:08:23,755 --> 01:08:25,645
- to get me a present.
- Mmm.

1159
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:27,346
Oh, Reynardo, you...

1160
01:08:27,398 --> 01:08:31,161
Trust him to take advantage
of a situation like this.

1161
01:08:31,724 --> 01:08:33,335
I wanna go with you, Lili.

1162
01:08:34,328 --> 01:08:36,277
Why don't you take
us all with you?

1163
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,958
We don't want you
to forget us, Lili.

1164
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:40,641
I never could forget you.

1165
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:42,999
You've become so
very dear to me.

1166
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:45,963
You're the only things I love.

1167
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:48,670
I know you love me, too.

1168
01:08:51,545 --> 01:08:53,764
Why, you poor darlings,
you're trembling.

1169
01:09:05,410 --> 01:09:06,805
Well, are you staying or going?

1170
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:08,936
We've had an offer
from the Folies Paris,

1171
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,481
but we can't accept it
without you.

1172
01:09:11,785 --> 01:09:15,825
I've been an idiot,
a stupid fool.

1173
01:09:16,816 --> 01:09:20,348
Melting and sniveling over
Reynardo and Carrot Top.

1174
01:09:21,768 --> 01:09:23,499
I must be crazy.

1175
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,943
They've become
so very dear to me,

1176
01:09:27,943 --> 01:09:32,865
I forget...I forget every time
that it's only you.

1177
01:09:33,817 --> 01:09:34,917
Or is it you?

1178
01:09:36,246 --> 01:09:37,077
Is it?

1179
01:09:37,805 --> 01:09:38,752
Wh-what are you?

1180
01:09:38,752 --> 01:09:42,468
Are you just a monster
without any feeling?

1181
01:09:43,661 --> 01:09:45,555
Why can't you ever say
a kind word?

1182
01:09:46,365 --> 01:09:48,184
Why do you hide
behind those puppets?

1183
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,330
I am the puppets!

1184
01:09:50,737 --> 01:09:55,519
I'm Carrot Top: Confident, clever,
capable of running his life and yours

1185
01:09:55,519 --> 01:09:56,261
and everybody else's.

1186
01:09:56,261 --> 01:09:59,549
And I'm Golo the Giant:
Cowardly, stupid,

1187
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,979
longing to be loved, clumsy,
and in need of comforting.

1188
01:10:03,729 --> 01:10:08,913
And I'm Marguerite, too:
Vain, jealous, obsessed with self,

1189
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,521
looking at my face in the mirror.

1190
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,131
Are my teeth nice?
Is my hair growing thin?

1191
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:17,665
And I'm Reynardo
the thief, the opportunist,

1192
01:10:17,665 --> 01:10:19,177
full of compromise and lies.

1193
01:10:19,177 --> 01:10:21,198
Like any other man, I have in me
all these things,

1194
01:10:21,392 --> 01:10:23,374
all of these and
as many more again.

1195
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:25,978
Must I make a new puppet
for the small part of me

1196
01:10:25,978 --> 01:10:26,975
you've managed to see?

1197
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,129
The monster?

1198
01:10:28,129 --> 01:10:29,013
The angry man?

1199
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:32,502
The frustrated dancer, clumping along
with a leg anchored to the ground,

1200
01:10:32,502 --> 01:10:33,825
and a heart anchored to...

1201
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,700
but you don't have to understand me
or even like me.

1202
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:45,821
This is business.

1203
01:10:47,890 --> 01:10:49,261
Not anymore.

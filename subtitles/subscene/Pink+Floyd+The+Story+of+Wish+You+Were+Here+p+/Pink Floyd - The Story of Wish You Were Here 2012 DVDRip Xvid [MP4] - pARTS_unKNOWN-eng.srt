This programme contains some strong language.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>How I wish How I wish you were here

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,280
<i>Year after year

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,480
<i>Running over the same old ground

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,120
<i>What have we found?

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,760
<i>The same old fears

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

9
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,040
It did stem from those first four notes

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,320
that popped out of the guitar one day in King's Cross.

11
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,560
Somehow, those notes evoked a song about Syd

12
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,240
and his disappearance, absence, if you like, in Roger.

13
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
It's my homage to Syd

14
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:05,400
and my heartfelt expression of my sadness and...

15
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,760
But also my admiration for the talent, and my sadness

16
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,960
for the loss of the friend.

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,200
<i>You were caught in the crossfire

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,240
<i>Of childhood and stardom

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,800
<i>Blown on the steel breeze.</i>

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,320
I think the song is brilliant in its sort of evocation of what

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Roger obviously felt about Syd, and certainly, it matches mine.

22
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,440
I think what was so important was to not try

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
and write him out of history.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>Come on, you stranger

25
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,000
<i>You legend, you martyr

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,600
<i>And shine!</i>

27
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,480
There are no generalities, really, in that song.

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,120
It's not about, "All the crazy diamonds", it's about Syd.

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
THEY VOCALIZE AND EMIT NOISES

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
When I first saw the Floyd, I remember...

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,720
I mean, the first thing you noticed was the lights,

32
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,200
because nobody was doing that then. At least I hadn't seen it.

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,000
But Syd really started to shine.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,480
You know, you couldn't really take your eyes off him,

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,280
even in the murk and the purple and green blobs, you know,

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
the bright-eyed Syd and his singing and his guitar playing

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
kind of jumped out at you.

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,720
<i>Blinding signs flap Flicker, flicker, flicker

39
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>Blam... Pow! Pow!

40
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,360
<i>Da, da-da, da, da-da, da-da

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
<i>Da-da, da-da

42
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,240
<i>Ooooh!</i>

43
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,360
By the time I was working with them in the studio,

44
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,880
it was clear that the real creative shape of the group emanated

45
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,720
from Syd, although,

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
you know, it certainly wasn't Syd and backing group.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,360
Syd was a very wonderful chap.

48
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Very, very witty. Very, very sharp.

49
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,880
You know, he was out-going, charming, wonderful, friendly.

50
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,440
You name it. I mean, a wonderful man.

51
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,040
He was one of the gang, I guess you'd say.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
A good friend. Funny.

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,080
Rather annoying, though - he was good looking

54
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,200
and played guitar and could paint,

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,280
and always had nice girlfriends.

56
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,400
No-one that you ever really would have imagined

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,520
would wind up the way he did wind up.

58
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
<i>Remember when you were young

59
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
<i>You shone like the sun

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</i>

61
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,320
<i>Little by little The night turns around

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,600
<i>Counting the leaves Which tremble at dawn

63
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,680
<i>Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah

64
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,480
<i>Ah, aaah, ah, aaah, ah

65
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,680
<i>Set the controls For the heart of the sun

66
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,800
<i>Heart of the sun

67
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,440
<i>Heart of the sun.</i>

68
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,800
In this post Dark Side Of The Moon period,

69
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,960
we were all having to assess

70
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,640
what we were in this business for,

71
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,640
why we were doing it, whether we were artists or business people.

72
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,160
Having achieved the sort of success

73
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,560
and money out of it all that...

74
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,120
that could fulfil anyone's wildest teenage dreams,

75
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,400
why we would still want to continue to do it.

76
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah, I remember the disappointment of Top Of The Pops

77
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,840
or having the first hit single or whatever.

78
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,640
It's not as world-shaking

79
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,160
and changing as perhaps you expect it to be.

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,200
So maybe, you know, because of the enormous success

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,760
of Dark Side, there was still that sense of,

82
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,200
"Well, this hasn't made us feel enormously different or satisfied."

83
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,360
Roger, I think, has sometimes said that he thinks

84
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,520
that we were kind of finished at that point,

85
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,440
and he may have been right.

86
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I think we were at a watershed then,

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,320
and we could easily have split up then.

88
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,880
And we didn't, because we were frightened

89
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,000
of the great out there, beyond the umbrella

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,400
of this extraordinarily powerful and valuable trade name - Pink Floyd.

91
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
It was the first song they played, and it was like, "Whoa,"

92
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
it was like singing about Syd Barrett.

93
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,720
The band that was known for their musicality,

94
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,800
they weren't doing their music justice.

95
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,640
Do you recall there was a famous review by Nick Kent?

96
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,760
How could I forget?

97
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,400
I kind of over-reacted, obviously.

98
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,520
I mean, I feel now that I over-reacted,

99
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,600
but at the same time, they partly deserved it.

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,440
It was a bad gig.

101
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
It was, it was shambolic.

102
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,200
I mean it was...it lacked enthusiasm and it lacked a sort of purpose,

103
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,520
a sense of purpose, and I don't really know why.

104
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,880
From my perspective now, to look back upon how I felt then,

105
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,480
scared as I was of my own shadow, you know,

106
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,400
never mind my relationship with audiences,

107
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,400
and there were real concerns about not making any contact

108
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,880
with the audience during much of that tour of England

109
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,160
that we did in 1974.

110
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,200
And we didn't. We were... we were very disconnected.

111
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,600
If we weren't giving 100%, we couldn't quite sort out why not.

112
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
You know, there was an element of frustration

113
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
in having someone tell us that.

114
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,600
I think we probably knew it and couldn't quite sort of deal with it.

115
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,880
That review would have been one of the things which would have -

116
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,520
once we'd got over our initial ire - we would have taken on board

117
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,800
and realised that there was more than a germ of truth in it.

118
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,480
I was asked to record the Floyd at what was then called

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,600
the Empire Pool, which is now the Wembley Arena,

120
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,040
and when I saw the Floyd before they went on, they said,

121
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,520
"Oh, do us a favour, will you go and sit with our sound engineer?"

122
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,800
And I said, "OK."

123
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,400
How long is it since you've been here, Brian?

124
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,160
30 years.

125
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,840
And anyhow,

126
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,560
I went back in the interval and they said

127
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,080
"Well, what do you think?" And I said, "It's rubbish."

128
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,000
Because I'd been used to working with smaller groups

129
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,560
on smaller mixing desks, and theirs was massive.

130
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,880
So anyway, cut a long story short,

131
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,800
next thing I knew, I was doing the next night at the Empire Pool.

132
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,280
Oh, God, this does take me back.

133
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
And then I ended up doing the rest of the British tour.

134
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,000
Somebody better just run through this.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,080
And then, as I say, then came Wish You Were Here.

136
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,360
There were a lot of days where we didn't do anything,

137
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
while they were thinking about ideas.

138
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,600
The reality was that we were struggling with making the follow-up

139
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,200
to Dark Side, and we rushed back in to the studio to do that.

140
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:44,080
You know, we put ourselves under a sort of ridiculous pressure,

141
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,240
in a way, trying to make a record from nothing.

142
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
It was disengagement.

143
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,080
It was not being willing to apply yourself sufficiently.

144
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,000
A lot of moments where any one of us might have been much more

145
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,880
interested in thinking about what they were doing that weekend.

146
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,120
It became a case of two would be in the studio and two were running

147
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,160
late or, as it was always known, they were out playing squash.

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,080
And then we had the dartboard with the air rifle.

149
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,320
The concentrated activity was rather diluted,

150
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,240
and I'm sure for a...

151
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,920
..a very pushing, driving sort of person

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,720
like Roger, it was more frustrating than it was for anyone else,

153
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,960
although considerably frustrating for all of us, I suspect.

154
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,400
When I'm in the studio, I'm there to do something,

155
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,120
otherwise I'd rather be somewhere else, frankly.

156
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
So I'm there to work.

157
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,120
Well, you know, there's the legendary argument

158
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,520
that I must have had with the rest of them about...

159
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,880
..my thought at the time that it would be better to use

160
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,520
the other two tracks as well that we had been working on.

161
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,880
I had to fight David for a bit, as he acknowledges completely,

162
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,920
you know.

163
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,960
We had a completely different idea about it,

164
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,880
and that was a...that was a fight that I won.

165
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,240
Dave saw a record that had those two songs and Shine On,

166
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
and it felt cobbled together to me.

167
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,360
It didn't feel like real.

168
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,240
And so at some point in that process, yeah,

169
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,720
I came up with the idea of, "No, this has to be thematic,"

170
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,200
and that's the way I expressed it.

171
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,360
This will make this a more coherent work,

172
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,720
and because it's more coherent,

173
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,600
it will be better than if we just throw all the songs

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,200
we've been working on together and go boom, there you are, that's it.

175
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,880
There's one song that's about Syd, but the rest of it isn't.

176
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,320
It's a much more universal expression of my feelings

177
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,400
about absence...

178
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,800
..because I felt that we weren't really there,

179
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
we were very absent.

180
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,920
I remembered it.

181
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
<i>Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar

182
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,920
<i>You're gonna go far.</i>

183
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,120
"Come in here and have a cigar,"

184
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,160
you know, and become a star and become immortal.

185
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,120
<i>You're gonna make it if you try

186
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,840
<i>They're gonna love you.</i>

187
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,560
You become part of the whole buying and selling machine.

188
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,000
It's high.

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,920
I would need to do a number of vocal exercises before I attempted that.

190
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,040
I think the lyrics so much sum up the recording business.

191
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
Rock 'n' roll, man.

192
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,320
<i>Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar

193
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,360
<i>You're gonna go far.</i>

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,240
The record companies were... they were all-powerful, in a way.

195
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,080
No-one worked without a record deal in those days,

196
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,840
so they had a lot of power.

197
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,720
You're not longer really an individual any more,

198
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,840
you're just...you're a cipher,

199
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,520
you're playing a part, you're a puppet.

200
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,080
You're not your own man.

201
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
<i>The weather's just fantastic That is really what I think

202
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,440
<i>Oh, by the way Which one's Pink?</i>

203
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
By the way, which one is Pink?

204
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,880
Which one's Pink?

205
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,080
Which one's Pink?

206
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,640
<i>And did we tell you The name of the game, boy?

207
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,120
<i>We call it Riding the gravy train.</i>

208
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,720
It was felt that Syd's madness had partly come about

209
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,640
through the demands of the record industry.

210
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,800
"You've had a hit, now I want you to do another hit."

211
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,920
"I want you another hit, and I want another hit."

212
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,120
"And that's not as good as your last hit."

213
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,040
"That's not as good as your last record," you know,

214
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,320
"And I want you to do a bigger show and have more lights

215
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,600
"and more people."

216
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,560
I mean, it's...

217
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,760
"Hey, all I wanted to do is to play a guitar

218
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,200
"and write a song, and suddenly I'm in the middle of all this."

219
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,080
The star thing doesn't make... doesn't make you happy, you know.

220
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,200
That, the star thing, can make you want to withdraw from society.

221
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>It's awfully considerate of you To think of me here

222
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,400
<i>And I'm most obliged to you For making it clear

223
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,200
<i>That I'm not here.</i>

224
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,960
Well, you could argue that Syd was burned by the music business,

225
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,520
but actually, he was probably burned more by us.

226
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,240
<i>And I never knew the moon...</i>

227
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,720
Syd had sort of gone off the idea of doing Top Of The Pops,

228
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,480
and being sort of commercial.

229
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,760
<i>..shoes and brought me here.</i>

230
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,840
I think it wasn't the record company putting the pressure on, it was us

231
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,200
putting the pressure on, because that's the way we wanted to go.

232
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,960
<i>I don't care If the sun doesn't shine

233
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,880
<i>And I don't care If nothing is mine

234
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,360
<i>And I don't care If I'm nervous with you

235
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,560
<i>I'll do my loving in the winter.</i>

236
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,320
<i>Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar

237
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,600
<i>You're gonna go far

238
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>Fly high...</i>

239
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
With Have A Cigar,

240
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,920
both of them knew that neither of them could sing it.

241
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,560
I always thought that Dave's voice was not deep enough.

242
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,120
<i>I've always had a deep respect I mean that most sincerely.</i>

243
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,360
Yeah, that's Dave.

244
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,520
<i>I think the band's fantastic That is really what I think

245
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,080
<i>By the way, which one's Pink?</i>

246
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,120
That's Roger.

247
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,840
They wanted the ferocity which Roger gives on other tracks.

248
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,520
At the time, he just felt that he hadn't got it.

249
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,320
"Come in here, dear boy, have a cigar.

250
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,280
"You're gonna go far."

251
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
Roy was definitely one of the great characters around for a lot

252
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,600
of our early... our early life, really.

253
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,960
We used to do quite a lot of shows where Roy would be on the bill.

254
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,320
A good guy to have around.

255
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,080
I was in Studio 2 and they were in Studio 3.

256
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,320
I think Roy was actually rather...

257
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,560
..lacking in momentum himself.

258
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,920
I think we were...

259
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,000
It didn't only seem to affect Pink Floyd.

260
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,480
You know, that's why I have this vision,

261
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I guess, of me being in and out all the time, in and out, in and out.

262
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,480
He spent quite a lot of time in the studio with us.

263
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Very expensive recording time that he would spend just

264
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,680
in our control room chattering and...

265
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,760
Anyway, I digress.

266
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,840
Roger was really struggling with it,

267
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
and then Dave... then they both tried.

268
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,120
There was a lot of arguing about how we were going to do it

269
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,080
and how we were going to make it work.

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,480
At one point Roy, who was in the room, piped up and said...

271
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,600
I just said, "I'll do it if you like, for a price."

272
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,960
<i>I've always had a deep respect and I mean that most sincerely

273
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,480
I mean, Roy really put his heart in this.

274
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,080
I mean, I can picture him now...

275
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,720
<i>Which one's Pink?</i>

276
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,040
..putting his heart and soul in to it,

277
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,080
as if his life depended on it.

278
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>You gotta get an album out You owe it to the people

279
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,320
<i>We're so happy We can hardly count.</i>

280
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,720
I mean, the lyrics...

281
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,960
If I'd have written those lyrics, I'd feel well pleased.

282
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,300
<i>And did we tell you The name of the game, boy

283
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,980
It was played millions of times around the world as a single.

284
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,280
That was my vocals on a... You know, really...

285
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,360
a kind of a number one selling single.

286
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,640
Everybody thought it was Roger.

287
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,480
I was a bit peed off about that.

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,280
I think if I'd sung it, it would be more vulnerable

289
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,760
and less cynical than the way he did it.

290
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,200
But that's not the way Roy sings.

291
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,680
He went off and did it and did a great job, and thank you very much.

292
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,040
I don't think Roger liked his version terribly much,

293
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,080
but I think his version is the perfect version.

294
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,360
He was singing a sort of parody, anyway...

295
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
..which I don't like. I never liked it.

296
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,000
The worst of it is that sometimes when I'm doing,

297
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
you know, when I'm doing a gig...

298
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,640
..there's some wag'll shout, "Have A Cigar", you know.

299
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,120
I regret it, and that's not

300
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
cos I've got anything against Roy, I haven't, you know.

301
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,120
And, um...

302
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:35,520
I think if I'd persevered with it, I would have done it better.

303
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,760
<i>Come in here, dear boy Have a cigar

304
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,560
<i>You're gonna go far

305
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,880
<i>You're gonna fly high

306
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,320
<i>You're never gonna die You're gonna make it if you try

307
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,360
<i>They're gonna love you.</i>

308
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,200
I was so unbelievably thrilled

309
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,600
to be there, and I was just very young,

310
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
I was just about 21.

311
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,040
There is actually a rather nice picture of me

312
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,600
that Nick Mason took, and it sort of sums up, because I just look

313
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,000
wide-eyed and,

314
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,200
you know, thrilled is the only word, I think.

315
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,160
I'd baked some fairy cakes,

316
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,840
and I thought it would be a good idea to bring them to the studio.

317
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,280
There's this wonderful sequence of Roger proving that he did

318
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,840
enjoy the cake.

319
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,040
I think that Nick took these pictures,

320
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,200
because I can't imagine that I had the courage to sort of,

321
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,400
you know, take them, but perhaps I did.

322
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,640
Roger is in the driving seat in these pictures,

323
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
as far as the studio's concerned, and perhaps that position is hard.

324
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,680
But, actually, it's probably better

325
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,920
if just one person is in the driving seat.

326
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,320
Roger, actually, you know, kept a tight hold on the helm,

327
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,040
and that's what he - that's what he did.

328
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,120
And, you know, you can't gainsay that,

329
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,680
because the records, you know, the records were very good.

330
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,120
Dark Side was just a such a sort of thing.

331
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,840
All the pieces fell into place,

332
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,160
or as Nick Mason says,

333
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,560
"The drumming did it."

334
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,680
So I think that that was quite hard to deal with.

335
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,480
What do you do next? What do you do to top it?

336
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,240
What do you do to be different?

337
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,240
Well, I couldn't draw,

338
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,080
so fantasy pictures were out.

339
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,720
I couldn't paint, so artsy fartsy was out.

340
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,920
I wasn't a graphic designer, and also, I was not interested

341
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:49,160
in band pictures, because I found them a bit dull, you know, a group

342
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:53,160
of four musicians who play guitar, drums and bass or keyboards

343
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,560
would seem to me to be four musicians. They could be anybody.

344
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,840
We always felt that representing the music was the order of the day.

345
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,920
I know, it sounds radical, even revolutionary!

346
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,120
So in order to represent the music, one didn't really want to be limited

347
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:15,000
in the great palette of art and life to a picture of four geezers.

348
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,840
We'd mostly, in those days, left it to Storm to come up with

349
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,000
things which we would give him a desultory two minutes

350
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,440
of our mixing time, to say that one, maybe, that one, not that, not that.

351
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,600
They were recording at Abbey Road, and I remember going there,

352
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,480
and I remember I was very...

353
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,440
I was very nervous in doing the presentation.

354
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,760
He came up with these - this, you know, from the lyrics,

355
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,880
from this theme of absence, and it just seemed like a very good idea.

356
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,680
I remember getting a little round of applause.

357
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,640
I was most gratified, I can tell you.

358
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,560
Storm, actually, is probably one of the most argumentative people

359
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,640
you could ever meet.

360
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
Roger and Storm would have these intense conversations

361
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,840
over fine wines and so on.

362
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,440
Storm and Roger were two great intellects and, you know,

363
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,840
there was sparks flying in their brains, those two.

364
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,320
I got very pre-occupied with four, with the number four.

365
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,520
There were four words in the title, four members of the band,

366
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,040
and four elements to life - air, fire, water and earth.

367
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,080
So the first thing that was done was a postcard.

368
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,400
The postcard said "Wish You Were Here."

369
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,560
Po found this fantastic location, called Lake Mono,

370
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,760
which is such an amazing location

371
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,040
that you could just about photograph a plastic duck in it

372
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,120
and you'd like it.

373
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,360
We always thought there was an element of Storm loving to find

374
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,800
the most expensive, distant location in the world

375
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,680
so he could go off and have a little jolly for a few days at our expense.

376
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,160
This guy is doing a yoga position

377
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,440
in a yoga chair locked into the mud,

378
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,960
poor man, with a breathing apparatus on.

379
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,560
And he had to hold his breath so I didn't get any bubbles.

380
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,640
That's all shot for real. That's not airbrushed or cut or anything.

381
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,440
That was a moment in time on a magical evening,

382
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,680
with amazing light.

383
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,000
Did that take a long time to set up, that shot?

384
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,560
A fucking long time.

385
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,640
This shot was a pain in the arse.

386
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,520
I came to the notice of Pink Floyd,

387
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,400
because I made a film in Los Angeles for the BBC.

388
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,840
I thought that I would do a kind of a visual diary

389
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,440
of Americana at that time.

390
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,960
So I drew everything that I could think of at the time,

391
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,360
like Black Power, Playboy magazine, Mickey Mouse.

392
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,920
Hi, guys.

393
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,600
There was a fantastic Mickey Mouse sequence, where Mickey

394
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,200
goes from being the mouse to being a sort of drug crazed mouse.

395
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,080
HE SIGHS

396
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,880
Hey, man. That was far out, man.

397
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,920
Mickey's such a clean living guy, and there he was...

398
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,280
..on drugs.

399
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,800
I thought it was absolutely brilliant, and I just thought

400
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,080
this, we could really...

401
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,320
It'd be great to work with someone who produced

402
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,000
something like this.

403
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,880
And I took it to Roger and showed Roger and Roger loved it.

404
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,400
It was very awkward, like all relationships at the beginning,

405
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,080
because they wanted one thing from me,

406
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,000
and I wasn't coming up with the goods, I felt.

407
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,840
When I say this to Roger today, he says, "Oh, I don't remember that."

408
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,160
I just remember it was an enormous relief

409
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,400
after a lot of the flailing around visually

410
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,920
that we'd done with Dark Side Of The Moon.

411
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,560
I think the Sandman is a particularly great image.

412
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,920
You know, the fact that we're all bits of sand that can blow away,

413
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,120
I think it's just an idea I had, really.

414
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,360
I wanted to do the impermanence of life or whatever, you know.

415
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,480
It all sounds rather... pretentious crap, really.

416
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,600
The beginning of the record sounds very melancholy,

417
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
and is very melancholy and is melancholy music.

418
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,080
Sort of blues,

419
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,520
it's a sort of G Minor blues that whole first six or seven minutes.

420
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,760
We obviously found a mood that we wanted to not exactly jam to,

421
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,760
but play around with and find something within.

422
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,640
And we were never too afraid of leaving quite a long period

423
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,240
of time instrumental before vocals came in.

424
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,400
You see, at the time, it was a case of let's see what works.

425
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,960
So then, hence, the wine glass tape came out.

426
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,040
The wine glasses were recorded for an album

427
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,520
they were going to make called Household Objects,

428
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,680
which we had on a loop

429
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,400
and then Rick then built up the sound

430
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,960
with synthesisers and organ.

431
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,920
They wanted a big sound, so the guitar was recorded

432
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,440
in a different studio,

433
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,080
so hence the click track.

434
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,760
He put his amplifiers and speakers down in studio one...

435
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,680
..being a classical music studio, and then mic'd it from a distance.

436
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,960
I think it comes across on the album.

437
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,280
You could picture it being played out somewhere in an auditorium.

438
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,040
This will be Rick featured on the end of Shine On,

439
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,040
where he really came in to his element.

440
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,320
You have a Hammond organ on there, you have grand piano...

441
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,760
..plus the other synthesised instruments he plays.

442
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,960
I can't remember exactly what synthesiser that was,

443
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:58,920
but this is Richard's...trademark.

444
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:06,120
He's a great piano player,

445
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,280
and does highlight, I think, his classical training.

446
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,680
And I think if he'd had another 20 minutes, you would have heard

447
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:21,080
probably like a Rick Wright concerto.

448
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,080
And at the very end, where he does the tribute to Syd Barrett,

449
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,080
I don't remember if that was just Rick thinking of that

450
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,560
at the spur of the moment.

451
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,360
That was a nice... a nice touching thing.

452
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,160
He was kind of a crazy diamond,

453
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55,280
and all the things it says about him

454
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,920
in those brilliant lines are very, very accurate, you know.

455
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,000
"You wore out your welcome with random precision",

456
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,680
was certainly a part of him.

457
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,640
<i>Well, you wore out your welcome With random precision

458
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,800
<i>Rode on the steel breeze

459
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,960
<i>Come on, you raver,

460
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,560
<i>You seer of visions

461
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,760
<i>Come on, you painter, you piper

462
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,440
<i>You prisoner, and shine!</i>

463
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,840
My memory is that we were recording a Radio One show

464
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,320
at the BBC...

465
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,440
..and Syd didn't turn up.

466
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,960
And I think it was a Friday.

467
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,600
And no-one could find him.

468
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,720
So we basically waited and waited, and I think

469
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,600
we had to cancel the recording, or we tried to do some without him,

470
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,280
I'm not sure, and then the managers went off trying to find him.

471
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,960
And when they found Syd, which I think was a Sunday or Monday,

472
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,040
they told us, "Well, something's happened to Syd."

473
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,640
And something had happened to him, total difference.

474
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,200
And I remember him being right like this, and looking in his eyes,

475
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,280
and it was just like...

476
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,320
HE MAKES CLICKING NOISE

477
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,440
..somebody had turned the lights out, you know,

478
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,080
he just looked so blank.

479
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,800
He was a living with a whole sort of community of people who were

480
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,760
very much believing acid can release you and, you know,

481
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,080
get to the truth and all that stuff,

482
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,960
and...he took too much.

483
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,640
And he went up on stage

484
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,360
and he just stood there for long stretches

485
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,760
and he'd play the guitar for a bit and then he'd stop.

486
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,080
He had done so much damage, because acid, that's what it does to you.

487
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,360
Too much acid will literally fry your brains.

488
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,200
<i>Nobody knows where you are

489
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,560
<i>How near or how far

490
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,040
<i>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</i>

491
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,960
We were unable to help Syd and probably, I won't say deliberately,

492
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,240
but had our own interests at heart, and so consequently

493
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,320
probably tried to hold on to him for far longer than we should have done.

494
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,080
Syd left the band in 1968.

495
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:36,480
Syd was only around for that one record, it was a tiny piece.

496
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,400
It was a very important piece, it was the opening piece

497
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,320
of the Pink Floyd Story, and it may well be that Pink Floyd

498
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,720
would never have started and would have never carried on

499
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,440
and nothing would have happened. We will never know.

500
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,800
He was a real hindrance to the band in many ways.

501
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,560
Having said that, we simply wouldn't have got to where we got to.

502
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:02,120
There would be no Dark Side Of The Moon if Syd

503
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,680
hadn't been around to take us on that first major step.

504
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I found it so upsetting working with Syd in those days.

505
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,640
It was like trying to...seeing someone sort of drowning

506
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,920
and trying to pull them out, but they kept on slip...you know,

507
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,320
the hand slipped away all the time.

508
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,200
We were hoping that it would be therapeutic for him

509
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,840
and might help him come back.

510
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,720
Trying...it was like trying to bring him back.

511
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,560
"Come back, Syd, come back."

512
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,200
And there was never likely to be any way back, and that is...

513
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,800
..quite awful to think about.

514
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,120
GUITAR MUSIC

515
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,040
<i>You reached for the secret too soon

516
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,440
<i>You cried for the moon

517
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,760
<i>Shine on you crazy diamond.</i>

518
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,080
And of course, they loved their ooohs,

519
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,160
so we just oooh'd them,

520
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,640
saying, "Shine on, you crazy diamond," and just oooh'd

521
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
the rest of the way. They loved ooohs.

522
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,720
Carlena and Venetta, being Americans and soulful,

523
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,240
was a wonderful contrast

524
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,040
between the sort of Britishness of Pink Floyd.

525
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,280
I didn't know them from a bar of soap,

526
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,960
and I didn't like their music in the beginning.

527
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,440
It was all in a minor key, it was all very low,

528
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,640
and everything was oohs and ahhs. Who are these people?

529
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,440
I thought Motown was meticulous, but this was the most meticulous

530
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,520
four musicians that I had ever seen work before.

531
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,560
And something told me in my head, "Venetta,

532
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,800
"you're here for a reason, you must enjoy this music,

533
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,680
"you must get on with this music, cos you're here,

534
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,800
"there's something for you to learn."

535
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,720
They managed to do their job without getting involved in the band

536
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,480
politics, so those two were very good at just..

537
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,920
You know, we might be all furious with each other

538
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,680
about something or other and having some great row

539
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,400
at the dinner table or in the car on the way to the show or whatever,

540
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,880
and they'd just be very, very relaxed and just get on with it.

541
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,400
And they always sang beautifully.

542
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,440
One of my fondest, fondest memories of being with Pink Floyd

543
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
recording Shine On You Crazy Diamond,

544
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,840
because that was the only thing that we got to actually record with them,

545
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,600
as opposed to singing-performing Dark Side Of The Moon.

546
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,680
So that was the great thing about it, we actually got on a record.

547
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:25,040
<i>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</i>

548
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,800
Welcome To The Machine.

549
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,840
They just wanted bits of ad-hoc animation bunged into the show

550
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,480
willy nilly. And, of course,

551
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,280
I had my little team of animators who are strictly trained to work

552
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,360
to a track, and without a track, they don't know what to do.

553
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
And I used to go and tell Roger this,

554
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,400
and he said, "It doesn't matter about a track, just let them do something."

555
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,040
I assume he made all that spherical stuff having heard

556
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,240
the VCS3 throbbing at the beginning of Welcome To The Machine.

557
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,360
Boom, boom, boom, boom... All of that stuff.

558
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,920
HE CLICKS AND WHIRS

559
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:23,280
When it came to Welcome To The Machine,

560
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,000
I think Roger was really getting into his synthesisers.

561
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,240
So, hence you have all these different effects.

562
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,200
I mean, some of these noises are, to me, just futuristic.

563
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,120
I loved that machine.

564
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,640
I used it a lot back in the day.

565
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,200
I've still got one. It's still good for wind and explosions.

566
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,720
THROBBING

567
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,000
See, and the throb

568
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,720
is basically what Roger would have played on bass.

569
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
He adds to it later on with the real bass.

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,600
THROBBING AND BASS

571
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,400
The only real instruments that really are on there are

572
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,160
Dave's acoustics.

573
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,640
'One, two, three, four...'

574
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,560
GUITAR

575
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:31,280
DRUMS

576
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,840
To add a bit more to the aggression of the song,

577
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,960
the timps and cymbals were added.

578
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,200
It just sounded like a very angry song to me, always did.

579
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,320
Very angry.

580
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,720
That somebody was getting something out of their system.

581
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,720
<i>Welcome, my son

582
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,600
<i>Welcome to the machine

583
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,880
<i>Where have you been?

584
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,040
<i>It's all right We know where you've been

585
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,400
This particular creature I created,

586
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,760
I remember showing it to the gang,

587
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
who sort of went along with everything I said at that point,

588
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,760
they didn't sort of correct anything.

589
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,040
Roger, particularly, has this idea that

590
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,880
if you hire an artist,

591
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,920
you don't try and change what that artist does,

592
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,320
you hire an artist for what he does.

593
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:46,800
Gerry has a very similar kind of...bolshie attitude

594
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,800
towards all status quo and all the powers that be that I do.

595
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,400
<i>So, welcome...

596
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,200
<i>To the machine.</i>

597
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,760
And the sea of blood that comes towards us

598
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,680
and crashes through the steel towers.

599
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,200
God knows what it's about.

600
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:13,240
But I thought it was a very kind of a strong image, a sea of blood.

601
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,200
I did really add piece by piece the animation, so when I'd done

602
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,320
the sea of blood, Roger probably said we need it a bit longer.

603
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,080
So then the sea of blood had to turn into hands, praying,

604
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,520
grasping hands,

605
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,480
hopeless lost kind of hands, I suppose,

606
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,800
searching for some god or some reason to it all.

607
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,440
You could say that Welcome To The Machine

608
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,360
is only about my experience in the music industry...

609
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,280
It's not, it's about all of our experience

610
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,040
in the face of that monstrous,

611
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:01,320
grinding thing that chews us up and spits us out.

612
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,480
In the meetings that Storm and I had, one of the topics

613
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,720
was somebody getting burnt in the business, you know,

614
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,400
which was an expression at the time. "Man, I've been burned."

615
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:25,560
You know, so, what more logical, kind of, concept, if you like,

616
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,360
would be than two men shaking hands and one of them is getting burnt?

617
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:33,200
And we both went, "Yeah!" Maybe because it was so outrageous.

618
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,920
And these are the days before computers,

619
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,960
so it meant setting a man on fire, which we did.

620
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,960
Yeah, it wasn't very difficult. Issuing orders from the bunker,

621
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,080
it's really easy. "Over the top, men."

622
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,720
Anyway, that was done for real in a studio lot in Hollywood.

623
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,160
What could be more absent than a studio lot?

624
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,560
I believe it was a Warner Brothers lot.

625
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,720
I was doing a lot

626
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,120
of fire work in those days,

627
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,320
and I had the special suits

628
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,640
and all this stuff

629
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,360
for full envelop fire, but a partial is basically,

630
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,520
you know, a pretty safe, pretty easy one to do.

631
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,320
And... In most cases.

632
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,680
He had a team of...20 people around him with fire extinguishers,

633
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,320
ready to deal with any emergency.

634
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,480
The effects man will step out

635
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,360
and he's got a wand about that long with a fire on the end of it,

636
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,280
and they go, "We're ready, action, and he just touches the three

637
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,640
or four spots like that, steps out, everything is burning,

638
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,960
and it's a still picture, so shake...shaking hands -

639
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,440
nothing to it.

640
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,480
And after I had shot about, I suppose, 15 shots,

641
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,560
and 15 times for somebody to catch fire is rather a lot,

642
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,240
suddenly a gust of breeze came up.

643
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,200
And the fire whipped round his face.

644
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,680
There's a funny thing about fire - when it gets in your face

645
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,480
you're going to move, that's just part of the thing.

646
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,040
And once it blew it around, I turned as fast as I could.

647
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,680
He fell to the ground, absolutely smothered with foam

648
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,520
and blankets and everything like that. He got up and he said,

649
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,320
"That's it, no more."

650
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,520
Luckily, I got it in the can.

651
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,800
And here we see his foot leaving frame.

652
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,960
And that's a sort of surreal image of absence in itself, you know?

653
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,480
But that's real absence.

654
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,760
Out of frame, out of sight, you know?

655
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,360
And you just kept shooting?

656
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,720
I just kept shooting, yeah.

657
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,840
I mean, I had to get this shot and it had to be right.

658
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:40,400
So, you know, I didn't have time to be concerned with his singed body.

659
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,840
You know, if they want somebody burning and they're going to pay me,

660
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,720
I don't care if they have an artist drawing the fire.

661
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,940
When developing a theme of absence,

662
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,340
it seemed therefore appropriate that in the end,

663
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:59,860
the cover should be absent.

664
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,020
The...um... Got it here.

665
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,180
The...um...

666
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,060
This is the end piece, or the end part of the puzzle.

667
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,460
Anyway, the record company, especially in America,

668
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,900
went complete apeshit.

669
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,940
"You mean wrap Wish You Were Here in black opaque shrink wrap

670
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,420
"so you can't see it? Are you completely fucking mad?"

671
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,700
But you had to have a sticker that said what it was,

672
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,540
otherwise the factory wouldn't pack it properly,

673
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,020
let alone the fans buy it.

674
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,180
I hear stories that there are some aficionados...

675
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,740
..who have had...who have had Wish You Were Here for many a year now,

676
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,780
and have carefully slit the opaque vinyl shrink wrap

677
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:44,100
and extracted the record

678
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,980
and actually haven't seen the cover in 35 years.

679
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,900
Brilliant. That's really absent.

680
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,020
Well, that's the one I can remember quite clearly.

681
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,220
That was me strumming a 12 string guitar,

682
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,540
which I'd recently purchased from a guy I know,

683
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,140
and coming up with, you know, the opening riff

684
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,540
of Wish You Were Here.

685
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,900
And again, like...

686
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,940
like the four notes at the beginning of Shine On You Crazy Diamond,

687
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,220
other people start going, "Hey,

688
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,140
"that's good, you've got something there."

689
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,780
And I said to him, "What's that you're playing? That's really nice."

690
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,460
And he played it.

691
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,260
And I said, "That's really good.

692
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,620
"Maybe I should try and do something with it."

693
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:55,180
I think Roger and I then worked on writing the verses

694
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:59,860
and putting those chords in to the... in to the whole thing, and Roger...

695
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,220
..did those brilliant words, and there we were.

696
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:09,820
<i>Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts

697
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,500
<i>Hot ashes for trees

698
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:17,620
<i>Hot air for a cool breeze

699
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,540
<i>Cold comfort for change

700
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,500
<i>And did you exchange

701
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,220
<i>A walk on part in the war

702
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,740
<i>For a lead role in a cage?</i>

703
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,180
That collaboration between David and I, I think is, you know,

704
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:48,500
really good. All bits of it are really, really good.

705
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,180
So I'm very happy about it.

706
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:04,380
<i>So, so you think you can tell

707
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:08,940
<i>Heaven from hell

708
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,300
<i>Blue skies from pain

709
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,580
<i>Can you tell a green field

710
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,940
<i>From a cold, steel rail?

711
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:24,820
<i>A smile from a veil?

712
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,780
<i>Do you think you can tell?</i>

713
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,420
I think most of the songs that I've ever written

714
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,860
all pose similar questions.

715
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:39,660
Can you free yourself enough to be able to experience the reality

716
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,780
of life as it goes on before you

717
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,300
and with you, and as you go on as part of it or not?

718
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:54,220
Because if you can't, you stand on square one until you die.

719
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,860
And I know that may sound like bullshit,

720
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,180
but that's what the song is about.

721
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,700
<i>How I wish How I wish you were here

722
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,180
<i>We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl

723
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,260
<i>Year after year

724
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,980
<i>Running over the same old ground

725
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,700
<i>What have we found?

726
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,340
<i>The same old fears

727
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:26,940
<i>Wish you were here.</i>

728
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,500
All the songs are encouraging me,

729
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,980
I guess I write them for me,

730
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,260
and it's to encourage myself...

731
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:43,580
..not to accept a lead role in a cage...

732
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,860
..but to go on demanding of myself

733
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:52,700
that I keep auditioning

734
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,100
for the walk on part in the war, because that's where I want to be.

735
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,820
I want to be in the trenches.

736
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,780
I don't want to be at headquarters or I don't want to be sitting

737
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,900
in a hotel somewhere.

738
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:09,420
I want to be... I want to be engaged...

739
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,300
..probably, I might say,

740
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,900
in a way that my father would approve of.

741
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:29,180
It's a very simple sort of country song, if you like.

742
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,980
It's still... Because of its resonance

743
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,260
and the emotional weight it carries,

744
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:40,020
it is one of our best songs.

745
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,860
People do attach to it lots of internal feelings that they may have,

746
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:52,140
and they may not be entirely sure what it's about, and neither am I.

747
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:55,020
I mean, I'm only telling you what it's about for me.

748
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,620
But there's no reason why other people shouldn't put

749
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,060
other interpretations on it, which could be just as valid.

750
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,540
Although Shine On You Crazy Diamond

751
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,860
is the one that is specifically about Syd, and Wish You Were Here

752
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,420
has a broader remit...

753
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,460
..I can't sing it without thinking about Syd.

754
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:37,740
My memory is that I came in to the studio

755
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,980
and there was this guy standing there in a Gabardine raincoat,

756
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:46,900
and a large, large bloke, and I had no idea who it was.

757
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:50,300
And surprisingly, no-one's saying, "Who's that person?

758
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,100
"What's he doing wandering around all our gear in the studio?"

759
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,780
And then...then him coming in to the control room and standing around,

760
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,300
and how remarkable, how long it was before anyone actually woke up.

761
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:11,460
Finally, I think it was David who said, "Nick, do you recognise him?"

762
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:17,180
And I looked and I think I either shrugged my shoulders

763
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,420
or at some point Dave sort of put me out of my misery

764
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:23,180
and said, "It's Syd".

765
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,140
And we just sort of stood there,

766
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,180
or sat there and just were shell-shocked, basically.

767
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,940
And then until somebody thought of something to say to him.

768
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:39,940
And then we were all unbelievably shocked at his appearance.

769
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,300
I mean, I didn't recognise him, I didn't know it was him.

770
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,780
But it was pretty...

771
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,500
..pretty affecting, really.

772
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:52,180
I mean, Roger and Dave cried.

773
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:57,860
You know, this slim, elegant...

774
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,660
..if bedraggled and dazed person that I had last seen, had turned

775
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,580
rather balloon shaped, and had no eyebrows and not much hair, and...

776
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:23,220
And there is the photograph of him in the studio at the time,

777
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:28,140
and if you looked at Syd in early '67

778
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,780
and Syd then, it was so different.

779
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,540
It was a great loss and, you know...

780
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:44,900
..imagining what he would have gone on to do is...

781
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,460
Speculating on that, if you like, is...

782
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,180
He could have become so great.

783
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,620
It's actually kind of nice standing up here with these three guys

784
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,380
after all these years.

785
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,460
Standing to be counted with the rest of you.

786
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:50,620
Anyway, we're doing this for everyone who's not here,

787
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,820
but particularly, of course, for Syd.

788
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:01,020
HE INTONES

789
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:05,300
To me, it's about the most complete album, in some ways,

790
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:11,980
and we all know how difficult it was to get to that point,

791
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:14,300
and the problems we had.

792
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,900
It's full of grief and anger, but also full of love.

793
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:31,220
You've got to see beyond the grief and anger to the possibilities of love.

794
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:37,640
APPLAUSE

795
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,360
Thank you.

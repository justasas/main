1
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:39,728
This Programme contains some strong Language.

2
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:47,152
# How I wish How I wish you Were here

3
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:53,577
# We're just two lost Souls Swimming in a Fish Bowl

4
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:56,930
# Year After Year

5
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,121
# Running over the Same old Ground

6
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:03,755
# What We have found?

7
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,386
# The Same old fears

8
00:01:07,386 --> 00:01:09,622
# Wish you Were here. #

9
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,534
It did Stem from Those first four Notes

10
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:11,804
That popped out one of the Guitar Day in King's Cross.

11
00:02:16,234 --> 00:02:20,026
Somehow, Those Notes evoked a Song About Syd

12
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:26,691
and HIS Disappearance, Absence, if you Like, in Roger.

13
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:29,046
It's My homage to Syd

14
00:02:29,046 --> 00:02:35,831
My heartfelt and Expression of My Sadness and ...

16
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:42,376
for the Loss of the friend.

17
00:02:42,376 --> 00:02:45,610
# You Were caught in the crossfire

18
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,644
# Of Childhood stardom and

19
00:02:48,842 --> 00:02:52,195
# Blown on the steel Breeze. #

20
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:59,698
I Think the Song is Brilliant in ITS Sort of evocation of What

21
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:03,450
Obviously Roger felt About Syd, and Certainly , it matches mine.

22
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,800
What was I Think SO Important was not to try

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,236
and write HIM out of History.

24
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:11,672
# Come on, you Stranger

25
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:14,346
# You legend, you Martyr

26
00:03:14,346 --> 00:03:16,940
# And shine! #

27
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,773
There are no generalities, really, in That Song.

28
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:40,408
It's not About, "All the Crazy Diamonds" , it's about Syd.

29
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:43,441
AND THEY Vocalize EMIT noises

30
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:56,652
When I first SAW the Floyd, I Remember ...

31
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:58,967
I Mean, the first thing you Noticed was the Lights,

32
00:03:58,967 --> 00:04:02,439
Because nobody was doing That then. At least I hadn't seen it.

33
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,228
But Syd Started to really shine.

34
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:09,703
You know, you couldn ' t really take your eyes off him,

35
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:13,494
even in the murk and the purple and green Blobs, you know,

36
00:04:13,494 --> 00:04:16,767
the bright-eyed Syd and his singing and his guitar playing

37
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:18,284
kind of jumped out at you.

38
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:23,911
# Blinding signs flap Flicker, flicker, flicker

39
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,583
# Blam ... Pow! Pow!

40
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:31,534
# Da, Da-Da, Da, Da-Da, Da-Da

41
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:33,211
# Da-Da , da-da

42
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:37,401
# Ooooh! #

43
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:40,515
By the time I was working with Them in the Studio,

44
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:45,025
IT Clear That was the Real Shape of creative the group emanated

45
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,861
from Syd, Although,

46
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:49,415
you know, IT Certainly was not Syd and backing Group.

47
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:06,457
Syd was a very wonderful CHAP.

48
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:08,892
Very, very witty. Very, very sharp.

49
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:15,956
You know, He was out-going, charming, wonderful, Friendly.

50
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:18,510
You Name it. I mean, a wonderful man.

51
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:23,100
He was one of the Gang, I guess you'd Say.

52
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,575
A good friend. Funny.

53
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,129
Rather annoying, Though - Good Looking He was

54
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,244
and Played Guitar and Could paint,

55
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:32,320
Always HAD nice and Girlfriends.

56
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:37,428
No-one That you really Ever Would have imagined

57
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:41,539
Would wind up the way He did wind up.

58
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:50,080
# Remember When you Were Young

59
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,668
# You shone like the sun

60
00:05:57,504 --> 00:06:03,770
# Shine on, you Crazy Diamond. #

61
00:06:23,566 --> 00:06:28,236
# Little by Little The night Turns around

62
00:06:32,586 --> 00:06:36,498
# Counting the leaves Which Tremble at Dawn

63
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:40,568
# Ah, aaah, AH, aaah, AH

64
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:44,360
# Ah, aaah, AH, aaah, AH

66
00:06:52,383 --> 00:06:54,657
# Heart of the sun

67
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,289
# Heart of the sun. #

68
00:07:05,075 --> 00:07:07,629
In this Post Dark Side Of The Moon period,

69
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,782
We Were All having to ASSESS

70
00:07:10,782 --> 00:07:14,454
What We Were in this for Business,

71
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:19,442
why We Were doing IT, Whether We Were Artists or Business People.

72
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:22,954
Having Achieved the Sort of Success

73
00:07:22,954 --> 00:07:29,341
and money out of IT All That ...

74
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:33,890
fulfil That Could anyone's wildest Teenage Dreams,

75
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,161
why We still Would Want to Continue to do IT.

76
00:07:38,161 --> 00:07:42,631
Yeah, I remember the disappointment of Top Of The Pops

77
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,587
or having the first hit single or whatever.

78
00:07:44,587 --> 00:07:47,380
It's not as world-shaking

79
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,895
and as changing Perhaps you expect IT to be.

80
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:54,924
So maybe, you know, Because of the enormous success

81
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,478
of Dark Side, there was still That sense of,

82
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,909
"Well, this Has not made us feel enormously different or satisfied. "

83
00:08:03,585 --> 00:08:07,057
Roger, I Think, Sometimes Has He Thinks That said

84
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:10,210
That We Were kind of finished at that point,

85
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,126
He and May have Been right.

86
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,796
I Think We Were at a watershed then ,

87
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,991
and We Could Easily have Split up then.

88
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:21,545
And We did not, Because We Were Frightened

89
00:08:21,545 --> 00:08:25,656
of the Great out there, Beyond the Umbrella

90
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:31,044
of this extraordinarily Powerful and Valuable Trade Name - Pink Floyd.

91
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:47,847
It was the first Song They Played, and IT was Like, "Whoa,"

92
00:08:47,847 --> 00:08:50,162
IT was Like Singing About Syd Barrett.

93
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:03,293
The Band That was known for Their musicality,

94
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,366
They Were not doing Their Music Justice.

95
00:09:06,366 --> 00:09:10,197
Do you Recall there was a Famous Review by Nick Kent?

96
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,313
How Could I forget?

97
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:13,949
I kind of over-reacted, Obviously.

98
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:16,064
I Mean, now I Feel That I over-reacted,

99
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:19,138
but at the Same time, partly They deserved IT.

100
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,973
It was a Bad Gig.

101
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,650
It was, it was shambolic.

102
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,716
I Mean IT was ... IT Lacked enthusiasm and IT Lacked a Sort of Purpose,

103
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:31,032
a sense of Purpose, and I do not really know why.

104
00:09:31,032 --> 00:09:37,377
From My perspective now, to Look back upon How I felt then,

105
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:42,965
as I was Scared of My Own Shadow, you know,

106
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,878
Never Mind My Relationship with Audiences,

107
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,869
and there Were Real Concerns About not making any Contact

108
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:54,340
with the audience DURING That much of Tour of England

109
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,617
That We did in 1974.

110
00:09:55,617 --> 00:10:01,644
And We did not. We were ... we were very disconnected.

111
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:09,027
If We Were not Giving 100%, we couldn't quite sort out why not.

112
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:12,460
You know, there was an element of Frustration

113
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,854
in having someone tell us That.

114
00:10:14,854 --> 00:10:20,002
I Think We Probably knew it and couldn't quite sort of deal with it.

115
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:26,269
That Review Would have Been one of the Things Which Would have -

116
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:31,896
once we'd got over Our Initial IRE - We Would have Taken on Board

117
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:35,169
and realised That there was More than a germ of Truth in IT.

118
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:54,806
I was Asked to Record at the Floyd What was then Called

119
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,918
the Empire Pool, Which is now the Wembley Arena,

120
00:10:57,918 --> 00:11:02,349
When I SAW and the Floyd before They Went on, They said,

121
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:06,819
"Oh, do us a Favour, Will you go and sit with our sound engineer? "

122
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:08,096
And I said, "OK."

123
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,691
How Long is IT since you've been here, Brian?

124
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,447
30 years.

125
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,118
And Anyhow,

127
00:11:17,835 --> 00:11:21,347
"Well, What do you Think?" And I said, "It's rubbish."

128
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,259
Because I'd Been Used to working with Smaller Groups

129
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,808
on Smaller mixing desks, and theirs was massive.

130
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:33,121
So anyway, Cut a Long Story Short,

131
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:37,032
next thing I Knew, I was doing the next night at the Empire Pool.

132
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:43,498
Oh, God, this does Take me back.

133
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:46,491
And then I ended up doing the rest of the British tour.

134
00:11:47,728 --> 00:11:50,203
Somebody Better just run through this.

135
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:54,274
And then, as I say, then came Wish You Were Here.

136
00:11:54,274 --> 00:11:56,549
There Were a Lot of days where We did not do anything,

137
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,902
while Were They Thinking About ideas.

138
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:03,773
That was The Reality We Were Struggling with making the Follow-up

139
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:07,365
to Dark Side, and We Rushed back in to the Studio to do That.

140
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:13,232
You know, We Ourselves put under a Sort of ridiculous pressure,

141
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,388
in a way, Trying to make a Record from nothing.

142
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,261
It was disengagement.

143
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:23,210
It was not Being willing to Apply Yourself sufficiently.

144
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:28,119
A Lot of Moments where any one of us Might have Been More much

145
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:32,988
Interested in Thinking About What They Were doing That weekend.

146
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:38,216
It Became a Case of two Would be in the Studio and two Were running

147
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:43,245
or late, as IT was Always known, They Were Playing Squash out.

148
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:50,151
And then We HAD the Dartboard with the Air Rifle.

149
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:56,377
The Concentrated activity was rather Diluted,

150
00:12:56,377 --> 00:12:59,290
and I'm sure for a ...

152
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,753
Like Roger, was IT More frustrating than IT was for anyone else,

153
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,987
Although considerably frustrating for All of us, I Suspect.

154
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:14,417
When I'm in the Studio, I'm there to do something,

155
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,128
otherwise I'd rather be somewhere else, frankly.

156
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,685
So I'm there to work.

157
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:34,093
Well, you know, there's the argument Legendary

158
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:37,485
That I must have HAD with the rest of Them About ...

159
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:42,834
.. My Thought at the time IT That Would be Better to use

160
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:46,466
the two Other Tracks as well That We HAD Been working on.

161
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:50,816
I HAD to Fight David for a bit, as He acknowledges Completely,

162
00:13:50,816 --> 00:13:51,854
you know.

163
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:54,887
We HAD a Completely Different idea About IT,

164
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:57,800
That was and a ... That was a Fight That I Won.

165
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:05,144
Dave SAW a Record That HAD Those two Songs and Shine On,

166
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,816
and IT felt cobbled Together to me.

167
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:11,251
It did not Feel Like Real.

168
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,124
And SO at some Point in Process That, yeah,

169
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:18,594
I Came up with the idea of, "No, this Has to be thematic,"

170
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,069
and That's the way I expressed IT.

171
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:27,215
This Will make this a More coherent work,

172
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,570
Because IT's and More coherent,

174
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:36,036
We've Been working on Boom Together and go, there you are, That's IT .

175
00:14:36,036 --> 00:14:39,707
There's one's That Song About Syd, but the rest of IT Is not.

176
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:45,135
It's a much More Universal expression of my feelings

177
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,211
About Absence ...

178
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:52,599
.. Because I felt That We Were not really there,

179
00:14:52,599 --> 00:14:54,076
We Were very absent.

180
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:08,684
I Remembered IT.

181
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:16,346
# Come in here, dear Boy Have a Cigar

182
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,663
# You're gonna go far. #

183
00:15:17,663 --> 00:15:19,858
"Come in here and have a Cigar,"

184
00:15:19,858 --> 00:15:23,890
you know, and Become a Star and Become Immortal.

185
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,845
# You're gonna make IT if you try

186
00:15:25,845 --> 00:15:27,562
# They're gonna Love you. #

187
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:32,271
You Become Part of the Whole Buying and selling Machine.

188
00:15:32,271 --> 00:15:33,708
It's High.

190
00:15:38,617 --> 00:15:43,726
I ??Think the Lyrics SO much Sum up the recording Business.

191
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:50,072
Rock 'n' roll, MAN.

192
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:53,983
# Come in here, dear Boy Have a Cigar

193
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:57,016
# You're gonna go far. #

194
00:15:57,016 --> 00:16:00,888
The Record companies Were ... they were all-powerful, in a way.

195
00:16:00,888 --> 00:16:03,722
No-one Worked without a Record Deal in Those days,

196
00:16:03,722 --> 00:16:06,475
so they had a lot of power.

197
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:12,342
You're not really an Individual longer any More,

198
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,457
You're just ... you're a cipher,

199
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:17,132
You're Playing a Part, You're a puppet.

200
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:18,688
You're not your Own MAN.

201
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:22,440
# The weather's just fantastic That is really What I Think

202
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,032
# Oh , by the way Which one's Pink? #

203
00:16:27,469 --> 00:16:29,305
By the way, Which one is Pink?

204
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:30,462
Which one's Pink?

205
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:31,660
Which one's Pink?

206
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:37,208
# And We did tell you The Name of the game, Boy?

207
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:40,680
# We call IT Riding the gravy train. #

208
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,267
It was felt Syd That's partly Madness HAD Come About

209
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:50,178
through the Demands of the Record Industry.

210
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:52,334
"You've HAD a hit, now I Want you to do Another hit."

211
00:16:52,334 --> 00:16:54,449
"I Want Another hit you, and I want another hit. "

212
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:56,644
"And That's not as Good as your Last hit."

213
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:59,558
"That's not as good as your last record, "you know,

214
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:01,833
"And I Want you to do a Show Bigger and More Lights have

215
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,110
"and More People."

216
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,065
I Mean, IT's ...

217
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,261
"Hey, All I wanted to do is to play a guitar

218
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:10,693
"and write a Song, and Suddenly I'm in the Middle of All this."

219
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:14,564
The Star thing does not make ... doesn't make you happy, you know.

220
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:18,675
That, the Star thing, you CAN make Want to Withdraw from Society.

221
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:23,465
# It's awfully considerate of you To Think of me here

222
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:28,853
# And I'm Most Obliged to you For making IT Clear

223
00:17:28,853 --> 00:17:30,648
# That I'm not here. #

224
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:33,403
Well, you Could Argue That Syd was Burned by the Music Business,

225
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,957
but Actually, He was Probably Burned more by us.

226
00:17:35,957 --> 00:17:37,674
# And I Never Knew the moon ... #

227
00:17:37,674 --> 00:17:41,146
Sort of Syd HAD gone off the idea of doing Top Of The Pops,

228
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:42,902
Sort of Being and Commercial.

229
00:17:42,902 --> 00:17:45,177
# .. Shoes and Brought me here. #

230
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:48,250
I Think IT was not the Record Company Putting the pressure on, IT was us

231
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,603
Putting the pressure on , because that's the way we wanted to go.

232
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:55,354
# I do not Care If the sun does not shine

233
00:17:55,354 --> 00:18:00,263
# And I do not Care If nothing is mine

234
00:18:00,263 --> 00:18:04,733
# And I do not Care If I'm Nervous with you

235
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:08,924
# I'll do My loving in the Winter. #

236
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,665
# Come in here, dear Boy Have a Cigar

237
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:19,940
# You're gonna go far

238
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,616
# Fly High ... #

239
00:18:21,616 --> 00:18:23,213
With Have A Cigar,

240
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:27,243
both of Them Knew That Neither of Them Could Sing IT.

241
00:18:27,243 --> 00:18:31,873
I Always Thought That Dave's Voice was not Deep Enough.

242
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:35,426
# I've Always HAD a Deep Respect I Mean That Most Sincerely. #

243
00:18:35,426 --> 00:18:36,663
Yeah, That's Dave.

244
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:42,809
# I Think the Band's fantastic That is really What I Think

245
00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:45,363
# By the way, Which one's Pink? #

246
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:46,401
That's Roger.

247
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:51,111
They wanted the Ferocity Which Gives Roger on Other Tracks.

249
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,572
"Come in here, dear Boy, have a Cigar.

250
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,527
"You're gonna go far."

251
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:05,678
Roy was definitely one of the Great characters around for a Lot

252
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:08,831
of Our Early ... Our Early life, really.

253
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:15,177
We Used to do quite a Lot of Shows where Roy Would be on the bill.

254
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,532
A Good Guy to have around.

255
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:23,279
I was in Studio 2 and they were in Studio 3 .

256
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,514
I Think Roy was rather Actually ...

257
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:29,745
.. lacking in Momentum Himself.

258
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,103
I Think We Were ...

259
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,175
It did not seem to Affect Only Pink Floyd.

260
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:36,650
You know, That's why I have this vision,

261
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,040
I guess, of me Being in and out All the time, in and out, in and out.

263
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,579
Very expensive recording time That He Would Spend just

264
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:53,812
in Our Control Room chattering and ...

265
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:55,887
Anyway, I digress.

266
00:19:55,887 --> 00:19:57,963
Roger was really Struggling with IT,

267
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,475
and then Dave ... then they both tried.

268
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:04,228
There was a Lot of arguing About How We Were going to do IT

269
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:06,185
and how we were going to make it work.

270
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:08,579
At one Point Roy, Who was in the Room, Piped up and said ...

271
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:12,690
I just said, "I'll do IT if you Like, for a price."

272
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:18,038
# I've Always HAD a Deep Respect and I mean that most sincerely

273
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,551
I Mean, Roy really put this in HIS Heart.

274
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,145
I Mean, I CAN Picture HIM now ...

275
00:20:24,145 --> 00:20:26,779
# Which one's Pink? #

276
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:29,094
.. Putting HIS Heart and Soul in to IT,

277
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,129
as if HIS life depended on IT.

278
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,081
# You gotta Get an album out You Owe IT to the People

279
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:38,354
# We're SO Happy We Hardly CAN count. #

280
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:39,750
I Mean, the Lyrics ...

281
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:43,981
If I'd have Written Those Lyrics, I'd Feel well pleased.

282
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:50,007
# And We did tell you The Name of the game, Boy

283
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:54,278
# We call the IT Riding gravy train. #

284
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:56,872
It was Played Millions of times around the World as a single.

285
00:20:56,872 --> 00:21:01,063
That was My vocals on a .. . You know, really ...

286
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:05,134
a kind of a number one selling single.

287
00:21:05,134 --> 00:21:07,409
Everybody Thought IT was Roger.

288
00:21:08,965 --> 00:21:11,241
I was a bit peed off About That.

289
00:21:11,241 --> 00:21:14,034
if I Think I'd Sung IT, IT Would be More vulnerable

290
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:16,509
and Cynical less than the way He did IT.

291
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,943
But That's not the way Roy sings.

292
00:21:18,943 --> 00:21:25,409
He Went off and did IT and did a Great job, and thank you very much.

293
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,759
I do not Think Roger liked his version terribly much,

294
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,793
but I Think HIS version is the perfect version.

295
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:36,065
He was a Singing Sort of parody , anyway ...

296
00:21:38,101 --> 00:21:42,092
.. Which I do not Like. I never liked it.

297
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:47,679
The Worst of IT is That Sometimes When I'm doing,

298
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,075
you know, When I'm doing a gig ...

299
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,301
.. there's some wag'll shout, "Have A Cigar", you know.

300
00:21:56,301 --> 00:21:58,775
I Regret IT, and That's not

301
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:01,329
cos I've got anything Against Roy, I have not, you know.

303
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:09,152
I Think if I'd persevered with IT, Would I have Done Better IT.

304
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:13,382
# Come in here, dear Boy Have a Cigar

305
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,177
# You're gonna go far

306
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:19,489
# You're gonna fly High

307
00:22:19,489 --> 00:22:22,922
# You're gonna Never Die You're gonna make IT if you try

308
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:25,955
# They're gonna Love you. #

309
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,775
I was SO unbelievably thrilled

310
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:38,168
to be there, and I was just very Young,

311
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,445
I was just About 21.

312
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,600
There is Actually a rather nice Picture of me

313
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,153
That took Nick Mason, and IT Sort of Sums up, Because I just Look

314
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:46,549
Wide-Eyed and,

315
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:49,743
you know, thrilled is the Only Word, I Think.

316
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,698
I'd Baked some fairy Cakes,

317
00:22:51,698 --> 00:22:54,372
and I thought it would be a good idea to bring them to the studio.

318
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:58,802
There's this wonderful Sequence of Roger Proving That He did

319
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:00,358
Enjoy the cake.

320
00:23:00,358 --> 00:23:03,552
That I Think Nick took These Pictures,

321
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:07,703
Because I can not imagine That I had the courage to sort of,

322
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:09,898
you know, Take Them, but Perhaps I did.

323
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,124
Roger is in the driving seat in these pictures,

324
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:20,115
as far as the Studio's Concerned, and Perhaps Position That is hard.

325
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:22,151
But , actually, it's probably better

326
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,383
if just one person is in the Driving seat.

327
00:23:25,383 --> 00:23:28,776
Roger, Actually, you know , kept a tight hold on the helm,

328
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:31,490
and That's What He - That's What He did.

329
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,563
And, you know, you can't gainsay that,

330
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:38,115
Because the Records, you know, the very Records Were Good.

331
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,529
Dark Side was just a such a sort of thing.

332
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,244
All the Pieces fell into Place,

333
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,561
or as Nick Mason says,

334
00:23:53,561 --> 00:23:54,958
"The drumming did IT."

335
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:59,069
So I Think That That was quite hard to Deal with.

336
00:23:59,069 --> 00:24:00,865
What do you do next? What do you do to top it?

337
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:02,621
What do you do to be Different?

338
00:24:04,058 --> 00:24:06,612
Well, I could not draw,

339
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,446
SO Fantasy Pictures Were out.

340
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:13,078
I could not paint, SO artsy fartsy was out.

341
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:17,268
I was not a graphic Designer, and Also, I was not Interested

342
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:22,497
in Band Pictures, Because I found a Them bit dull, you know, a group

343
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:26,488
of four musicians Who Play Guitar, Bass or Drums and Keyboards

344
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:29,881
Would seem to me to be four musicians. They could be anybody.

345
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:36,146
We Always felt Representing the Music That was the order of the Day.

346
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:39,220
I know, it sounds radical, even revolutionary!

347
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,410
So in order to Represent the Music, one did not really Want to be limited

348
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:48,280
in the Great palette of Art and life to a Picture of four Geezers.

349
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:54,106
We'd Mostly, in Those days, left to IT Storm to Come up with

350
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:59,256
Things Which We Would Give HIM a Desultory two minutes

351
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:04,683
Our Mixing of time, to Say That one, maybe, That one , not that, not that.

352
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:08,834
They Were recording at Abbey Road, and I Remember going there,

353
00:25:08,834 --> 00:25:10,710
and I remember I was very ...

354
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,664
I was very Nervous doing in the Presentation.

355
00:25:13,664 --> 00:25:17,974
He Came up with These - this, you know, from the lyrics,

356
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:23,083
from this Theme of Absence, and IT just Seemed Like a Good very idea.

357
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:25,877
I Remember Getting a Little Round of applause.

358
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:27,832
I was gratified Most, I CAN tell you.

359
00:25:27,832 --> 00:25:31,744
Storm, actually, is probably one of the most argumentative people

360
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:33,819
Could you Ever Meet.

361
00:25:33,819 --> 00:25:37,411
Roger and Storm Would have these intense conversations

362
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,005
over Fine Wines and SO on.

363
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,597
Roger Storm and two Were Great intellects and, you know,

364
00:25:43,597 --> 00:25:47,987
there was Sparks flying in Their Brains, Those two.

365
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:53,455
I got very pre-Occupied with four, with the number four.

366
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:56,649
There Were four Words in the title, four members of the Band,

367
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:01,158
and four Elements to life - air, fire, water and earth.

368
00:26:01,158 --> 00:26:04,191
So the first thing was Done That was a postcard.

369
00:26:04,191 --> 00:26:06,507
The postcard said "Wish You Were Here."

370
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:10,657
Po found this fantastic Location, Called Mono Lake,

371
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:12,853
Which is such an amazing location

372
00:26:12,853 --> 00:26:16,125
That you just Could Photograph About a plastic Duck in IT

373
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,203
and you'd Like IT.

374
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:20,435
We Always Thought there was an element of Storm loving to Find

375
00:26:20,435 --> 00:26:22,870
the Most expensive, Distant Location in the World

376
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,740
SO He Could go off and have a jolly Little for a FEW days at Our Expense.

377
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,214
This Guy is doing a Yoga Position

378
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,488
in a Yoga chair locked into the mud,

379
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:35,003
Poor MAN, with a Breathing apparatus on.

380
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:37,598
And He HAD to hold HIS Breath SO I did not Get any bubbles.

381
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,671
That's All for Real shot. That's not airbrushed or cut or anything.

382
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:44,462
That was a moment in time on a Magical Evening,

383
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:45,700
with amazing Light .

384
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,014
Did That Take a Long time to set up, That shot?

385
00:26:48,014 --> 00:26:50,568
A fucking Long time.

386
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:52,644
This shot was a Pain in the Arse.

387
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,473
I Came to the Notice of Pink Floyd,

389
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,780
I Thought That I Would do a kind of a diary Visual

390
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,376
of Americana at That time.

391
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,888
So I Drew Everything That I Could Think of at the time,

392
00:27:26,888 --> 00:27:30,281
Like Black Power, Playboy magazine, Mickey Mouse.

393
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,837
Hi, guys.

394
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,503
There was a fantastic Mickey Mouse sequence, where Mickey

395
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:42,095
Goes from Being the mouse to Sort of Being a Drug crazed mouse.

396
00:27:48,161 --> 00:27:50,955
HE SIGHS

397
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:53,749
Hey, MAN. That was far out, man.

398
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,782
Mickey's such a clean Living Guy, and there He was ...

399
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:01,132
. . on drugs.

400
00:28:01,132 --> 00:28:03,647
Thought I was absolutely Brilliant IT, and I just Thought

401
00:28:03,647 --> 00:28:05,922
this, We Could really .. .

402
00:28:05,922 --> 00:28:08,157
It'd be Great to work with someone Who Produced

403
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:09,833
something Like this.

404
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,704
And I took IT to Roger and Roger and Roger Showed loved IT.

405
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:18,215
It was very Awkward, Like All relationships at the Beginning,

406
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:19,891
Because They wanted one thing from me,

407
00:28:19,891 --> 00:28:21,806
and I was not Coming up with the Goods, I felt.

408
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:24,640
When I Say this to Roger Today, He says, "Oh, I do not Remember That."

409
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,953
I just remember it was an enormous relief

410
00:28:27,953 --> 00:28:31,186
After a Lot of the Visually flailing around

411
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,700
That we'd Done with Dark Side Of The Moon.

412
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:41,323
I Think the Sandman is a particularly Great Image.

413
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,669
You know, the Fact That We ' re all bits of sand that can blow away,

414
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:49,864
I Think IT's just an idea I HAD, really.

415
00:28:49,864 --> 00:28:55,093
I wanted to do the impermanence of life or whatever, you know.

416
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:59,204
It All Sounds rather ... pretentious crap, really.

417
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,271
The Beginning of the Record Sounds very Melancholy,

418
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:26,264
and is very Melancholy is and Melancholy Music .

419
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:29,737
Sort of Blues,

420
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:33,169
IT's a Sort of G Minor Blues Whole That first Six or seven minutes.

421
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:44,384
We found a Mood Obviously That We wanted to not exactly jam to,

422
00:29:44,384 --> 00:29:47,378
but Play around with and Find something within.

423
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,245
And We Were Never too afraid of leaving quite a Long period

424
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:57,834
of time before Instrumental Came in vocals.

425
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:28,926
You See, at the time, IT was a Case of let's See What works.

426
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:35,471
So then, hence, the Wine glass tape came out.

427
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:44,531
The Wine glasses Were Recorded an album for

428
00:30:44,531 --> 00:30:48,003
They Were going to make Called Household Objects,

429
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:50,158
Which We HAD a loop on

430
00:30:50,158 --> 00:30:54,868
and then Rick then built up the sound

431
00:30:54,868 --> 00:30:57,422
with synthesisers and Organ.

432
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,351
They wanted a Big sound, SO was the Guitar Recorded

433
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:12,868
in a different studio,

434
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:15,502
SO hence the click Track.

435
00:31:17,817 --> 00:31:22,167
He put HIS Amplifiers and speakers down in Studio one .. .

436
00:31:23,724 --> 00:31:28,074
.. Being a Classical Music Studio, and then mic'd IT from a Distance.

437
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,344
I Think IT comes across on the album.

438
00:31:35,897 --> 00:31:39,648
You Could Picture IT Being Played out somewhere in an Auditorium.

439
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,382
This Will be Rick featured on the end of Shine On,

440
00:31:51,382 --> 00:31:53,378
He really where Came in to HIS element.

441
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:01,640
You have a Hammond Organ on there, you have grand piano ...

442
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:08,065
.. plus the Synthesised Other Instruments He Plays.

443
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:24,230
I CAN 't remember exactly what synthesiser that was,

444
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:31,174
but this is Richard's ... Trademark.

445
00:32:33,768 --> 00:32:38,358
He's a Great piano player,

446
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:43,507
and does Highlight, I Think, HIS Classical Training.

447
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:48,895
And I Think if he'd HAD Another 20 minutes, you would have heard

448
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:53,285
Probably Like a Rick Wright Concerto.

449
00:32:57,796 --> 00:33:03,263
And at the very end, where He does the tribute to Syd Barrett,

450
00:33:03,263 --> 00:33:09,250
I do not Remember That if Rick was just Thinking of That

451
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,725
at the spur of the moment.

452
00:33:11,725 --> 00:33:15,517
That was a nice ... a nice touching thing.

453
00:33:23,578 --> 00:33:27,290
He was kind of a Crazy Diamond,

454
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,403
and the All Things IT says About HIM

455
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:35,033
in Brilliant Those lines are very, very Accurate, you know.

456
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,104
"You wore out your welcome with Random Precision" ,

457
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:40,781
Certainly was a Part of HIM.

458
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:46,727
# Well, you wore out your welcome With Random Precision

459
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:51,876
# Rode on the steel Breeze

460
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:55,029
# Come on, you Raver,

461
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:57,623
# You SEER of Visions

462
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:00,816
# Come on, you Painter, Piper you

463
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:04,488
# You Prisoner, and shine ! #

464
00:34:06,843 --> 00:34:10,873
My Memory is That We Were recording a Radio One Show

465
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:12,351
at the BBC ...

466
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,463
.. and Syd did not Turn up.

467
00:34:15,463 --> 00:34:16,980
And I Think IT was a Friday.

468
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,615
And no-one Could Find HIM.

469
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:22,727
So Basically We Waited and Waited, and I Think

470
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,601
We HAD to cancel the recording, or We tried to do some without HIM,

471
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:29,273
I'm not sure, and then the managers Went off Trying to Find HIM.

472
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,943
And When They found Syd, Which I Think was a Sunday or Monday,

473
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:38,013
They Told us, "Well, something's happened to Syd. "

474
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,603
And something HAD happened to HIM, Total Difference.

475
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:46,156
And I Remember HIM Like Being right this, and looking in his eyes,

476
00:34:46,156 --> 00:34:47,234
and IT was just Like ...

477
00:34:47,234 --> 00:34:49,268
HE MAKES CLICKING NOISE

478
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,384
.. HAD Somebody Turned the Lights out, you know,

479
00:34:51,384 --> 00:34:53,020
He just Looked SO blank.

480
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:58,728
He was a Living with a Whole Sort of Community of People Who Were

481
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:02,679
very much Believing acid CAN Release you and, you know,

482
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,992
Get to the Truth and All That stuff,

483
00:35:05,992 --> 00:35:09,863
... and He took too much.

484
00:35:09,863 --> 00:35:12,537
And He Went up on stage

485
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:17,247
and He just Stood there for Long stretches

486
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:20,639
and he'd play the guitar for a bit and then he'd stop.

487
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,952
He HAD SO much Damage Done, Because acid, That's What IT does to you.

488
00:35:23,952 --> 00:35:27,225
Too much acid literally Will Fry your Brains.

489
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:31,056
# Nobody Knows where you are

490
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,404
# How near or How far

491
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:44,866
# Shine on, you Crazy Diamond. #

492
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:52,768
We Were Unable to help Syd and Probably, I will not deliberately Say,

493
00:35:52,768 --> 00:35:57,039
but HAD Our Own interests at heart, and so consequently

494
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,107
Probably tried to hold on to HIM for far longer than We Should have Done.

495
00:36:03,225 --> 00:36:05,859
Syd left the band in 1,968.
four hundred ninety-six
00:35:39,880 -> 00:35:45,280
Only Syd was around for one That Record, IT was a tiny Piece.

497
00:36:11,247 --> 00:36:14,160
It was a very important piece, it was the opening piece

498
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,072
of the Pink Floyd Story, and IT May well be That Pink Floyd

499
00:36:18,072 --> 00:36:20,466
Would Never have Started and Never Would have Carried on

500
00:36:20,466 --> 00:36:23,180
and nothing Would have happened. We will never know.

501
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:29,526
He was a hindrance to the Real Band in many Ways.

502
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:34,276
Having That said, We simply wouldn't have got to where we got to.

503
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,830
There Would be no Dark Side Of The Moon if Syd

504
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,380
hadn't Been around to us on Take That first major Step.

505
00:36:55,669 --> 00:36:58,662
I found IT SO upsetting working with Syd in Those days.

506
00:36:58,662 --> 00:37:02,294
It was Like Trying to ... Sort of Seeing someone drowning

507
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:05,566
and Trying to pull out Them, but They kept on slip ... you know,

508
00:37:05,566 --> 00:37:07,962
the Hand Slipped away All the time.

509
00:37:07,962 --> 00:37:10,835
We Were Hoping That IT Would be Therapeutic for HIM

510
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:13,469
and help HIM Might Come back.

511
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:16,343
Trying ... IT was Like Trying to Bring HIM back.

512
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:18,179
"Come back, Syd, Come back."

513
00:37:25,004 --> 00:37:28,795
And there was likely to be Never any way back, and That is ...

514
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:35,380
.. quite awful to Think About.

515
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,689
MUSIC GUITAR

516
00:37:59,567 --> 00:38:03,558
# You reached for the Secret too soon

517
00:38:06,512 --> 00:38:08,946
# You Cried for the moon

518
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:15,253
# Shine on you Crazy Diamond. #

519
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,566
And of Course, They loved Their ooohs,

520
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:19,642
We just SO oooh'd Them,

521
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:22,117
Saying, "Shine on, you Crazy Diamond," and just oooh'd

522
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:23,873
the rest of the way. They loved ooohs.

523
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:31,177
and Carlena Venetta, Soulful and Being Americans,

524
00:38:31,177 --> 00:38:32,694
was a wonderful Contrast

526
00:38:37,243 --> 00:38:39,718
I did not know Them from a bar of soap,

527
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,393
and I didn't like their music in the beginning.

528
00:38:42,393 --> 00:38:44,867
It was All in a Minor Key, All IT was very Low,

529
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:49,058
Everything was oohs and ahhs and. Who are these people?

530
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:53,847
Thought I was Meticulous Motown, but this was the Most Meticulous

531
00:38:53,847 --> 00:38:57,918
four musicians that I had ever seen work before.

532
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,949
And something in me Told My Head, "Venetta,

533
00:39:01,949 --> 00:39:05,181
" you're here for a reason, you must enjoy this music,

534
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:08,055
"you must Get on with this Music, cos You're here,

536
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:15,080
They Managed Their job to do without Getting involved in the Band

537
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,831
Politics, SO Those two very Were Good at just ..

538
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:23,261
You know, We All Might be furious with each Other

540
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:29,727
Dinner at the table or in the Car on the way to the Show or whatever,

541
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:33,200
and they'd just be very, very relaxed and just Get on with IT.

542
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,716
And They Always beautifully Sang.

543
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:39,745
One of My fondest, fondest Memories of Being with Pink Floyd

544
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:43,018
recording Shine On You Crazy Diamond,

545
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:47,129
Because That was the Only thing That We Actually got to Record with Them,

546
00:39:47,129 --> 00:39:49,883
as Opposed to Singing-Performing Dark Side Of The Moon.

547
00:39:49,883 --> 00:39:52,956
That was the So Great About IT thing, We Actually got on a Record.

548
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:59,302
# Shine on, you Crazy diamond. #

549
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,036
Welcome To The Machine.

550
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:15,067
They just wanted bits of ad-hoc animation bunged into the Show

551
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:16,703
Willy nilly. And, of Course,

552
00:40:16,703 --> 00:40:21,493
I HAD My Little Team of animators Who are Strictly Trained to work

553
00:40:21,493 --> 00:40:25,564
to a Track, and without a Track, They do not know What to do.

554
00:40:25,564 --> 00:40:27,560
And I Used to go and tell Roger this,

555
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,591
and He said, "It does not Matter About a Track, just let Them do something."

556
00:40:33,706 --> 00:40:38,216
I Assume He made ??All That Heard having spherical stuff

557
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:43,404
the VCS3 throbbing at the Beginning of Welcome To The Machine.

558
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:47,515
Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom ... All of That stuff.

559
00:40:47,515 --> 00:40:50,069
HE CLICKS AND WHIRS

560
00:40:52,264 --> 00:40:57,414
When it came to Welcome To The Machine,

561
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:02,122
I Think Roger was really Getting into HIS synthesisers.

562
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,353
So, hence you have all these different effects.

563
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:15,293
I Mean, some of These noises are, to me, just futuristic.

564
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,202
I loved that machine.

565
00:41:20,202 --> 00:41:22,717
I Used a Lot IT back in the Day.

566
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:28,265
I've still got one. It's still good for wind and explosions.

567
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:31,777
throbbing

568
00:41:31,777 --> 00:41:34,053
See, and the throb

569
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:39,760
Basically What is Roger Would have Played on Bass.

570
00:41:42,035 --> 00:41:45,028
He adds to IT later on with the Real Bass.

571
00:41:45,028 --> 00:41:48,619
throbbing AND BASS

572
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,410
The Only Real Instruments That are really on there are

573
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,166
Dave's acoustics.

574
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,642
'One, two, Three, four ...'

575
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,555
GUITAR

576
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,263
DRUMS

577
00:42:07,178 --> 00:42:09,813
To Add a bit More to the aggression of the Song,

578
00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:13,924
and the timps Cymbals Were added.

579
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:24,141
It just sounded very Angry Like a Song to me, Always did.

580
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,258
Very Angry.

581
00:42:25,258 --> 00:42:28,651
Somebody That was something out of Getting Their system.

582
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,645
# Welcome, My Son

583
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:37,512
# Welcome to the Machine

584
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:45,774
# Where have you Been?

585
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:50,922
# It's All We know right where you've been

586
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:57,268
This Particular Creature I Created,

587
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:59,623
I Remember Showing IT to the Gang,

588
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:02,616
Sort of Who Went Along with Everything I said at That Point,

589
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:05,610
They did not Correct Sort of anything.

590
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,884
Roger, particularly, That Has this idea

591
00:43:07,884 --> 00:43:10,718
if you hire an artist,

592
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:12,754
you do not try and Change What That artist does,

593
00:43:12,754 --> 00:43:15,148
you hire an artist for What He does.

594
00:43:15,148 --> 00:43:20,616
Gerry Has a very Similar kind of bolshie Attitude ...

595
00:43:20,616 --> 00:43:25,605
Towards All status quo and All the Powers That be That I do.

596
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:31,193
# So, welcome ...

597
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:34,984
# To the Machine. #

598
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:37,539
And the sea of blood that comes towards us

599
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:40,452
and crashes through the steel towers.

600
00:43:40,452 --> 00:43:41,969
God Knows What's About IT.

601
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:46,997
But I Thought IT was a very kind of a strong Image, a sea of Blood.

602
00:43:46,997 --> 00:43:52,945
I really did Piece by Piece Add the animation, so when I'd done

603
00:43:52,945 --> 00:43:57,055
the sea of Blood, said Roger Probably We need IT a bit longer.

604
00:44:01,446 --> 00:44:05,796
So then the sea of Blood HAD to Turn into hands, Praying,

605
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:07,233
grasping hands,

606
00:44:07,233 --> 00:44:10,187
kind of lost Hopeless hands, I suppose,

607
00:44:10,187 --> 00:44:13,498
Searching for some god or some reason to IT All.

608
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,127
You Could Say That To Welcome The Machine

609
00:44:19,127 --> 00:44:23,038
is Only About My Experience in the Music Industry ...

610
00:44:24,475 --> 00:44:27,947
It's not, IT's About All of Our experience

611
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,701
in the Face of That monstrous,

612
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:34,972
That thing Grinding Chews us up and spits us out.

613
00:44:42,355 --> 00:44:46,107
In the Meetings That Storm and I HAD, one of the Topics

614
00:44:46,107 --> 00:44:49,339
Somebody was Getting Burnt in the Business, you know,

615
00:44:49,339 --> 00:44:53,012
Which was an Expression at the time. "Man, I've Been Burned."

616
00:44:53,012 --> 00:44:59,158
You know, SO, what more logical, kind of, concept, if you like,

617
00:44:59,158 --> 00:45:02,949
Would be than two Men shaking hands and is one of Them Getting Burnt?

618
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:06,781
And both We Went, "Yeah!" Maybe Because IT was SO outrageous.

619
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:09,495
And These are the days before computers,

620
00:45:09,495 --> 00:45:11,530
SO IT Meant Setting a MAN on Fire, Which We did.

621
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,524
Yeah, IT was not very Difficult. Issuing Orders from the Bunker,

622
00:45:14,524 --> 00:45:16,639
IT's really Easy. "Over the top, Men."

623
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:26,258
Anyway, Done That was for Real in a Studio lot in Hollywood.

624
00:45:26,258 --> 00:45:30,688
What Could be More than absent a Studio Lot?

625
00:45:32,883 --> 00:45:36,076
I believe IT was a Warner Brothers Lot .

626
00:45:36,076 --> 00:45:37,233
I was doing a Lot

627
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,628
of Fire work in Those days,

628
00:45:39,628 --> 00:45:41,823
and I HAD the Special Suits

629
00:45:41,823 --> 00:45:43,140
All this stuff and

630
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,852
for full Envelop Fire, but a partial is basically,

631
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:51,003
you know, a safe Pretty, Pretty Easy one to do.

632
00:45:51,003 --> 00:45:53,797
And ... In most cases.

633
00:45:53,797 --> 00:45:58,147
He HAD ... a Team of 20 people around him with fire extinguishers,

634
00:45:58,147 --> 00:46:00,782
Ready to Deal with any emergency.

635
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:02,936
MAN The Effects Will Step out

636
00:46:02,936 --> 00:46:06,808
and He's got a wand About That Long with a Fire on the end of it,

637
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:10,719
They and go, "We're Ready, Action, and He just touches the Three

638
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,071
or four spots Like That, steps out, Everything is burning,

639
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:19,380
and IT's still a Picture, SO ... Shake shaking hands -

640
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,857
nothing to IT.

641
00:46:20,857 --> 00:46:24,888
And After I HAD About shot, I suppose, 15 shots,

642
00:46:24,888 --> 00:46:27,961
and 15 times for somebody to catch fire is rather a lot,

643
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:29,638
Suddenly a Gust of Breeze Came up.

644
00:46:29,638 --> 00:46:32,591
And the fire whipped round his face.

645
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:35,066
There's a Funny thing About Fire - When IT Gets in your Face

646
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:38,857
you 're going to move, that's just part of the thing.

647
00:46:38,857 --> 00:46:42,409
And once IT IT blew around, I Turned as fast as I Could.

648
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:46,041
He fell to the Ground, absolutely Smothered with foam

649
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:48,875
and Blankets and Everything Like That. He got up and he said,

650
00:46:48,875 --> 00:46:50,671
"That's IT, no More."

651
00:46:50,671 --> 00:46:52,866
Luckily, I got in the IT can.

652
00:46:52,866 --> 00:46:55,141
And here We See HIS Foot leaving frame.

653
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:59,291
And That's a Sort of surreal Image of Absence in Itself , you know?

654
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,808
But That's Real Absence.

655
00:47:00,808 --> 00:47:03,083
Out of frame, out of sight, you know?

656
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,679
And you just kept shooting?

657
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:06,037
I just kept shooting, yeah.

658
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:08,152
I Mean, I HAD to Get this shot and IT HAD to be right.

659
00:47:08,152 --> 00:47:13,700
So, you know, I did not have time to be Concerned with HIS Singed body.

660
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,132
You know, if They Want Somebody burning and they're going to Pay me,

661
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:21,003
I Don ' t care if they have an artist drawing the fire.

662
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,702
When Developing a Theme of Absence,

663
00:47:30,702 --> 00:47:33,096
IT Seemed therefore Appropriate that in the end,

664
00:47:33,096 --> 00:47:34,613
Should the cover be absent.

665
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:37,767
The ... UM ... Got it here.

666
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,921
The ... UM ...

667
00:47:39,921 --> 00:47:43,793
This is the end Piece, or the end Part of the puzzle.

668
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:46,188
Anyway, the Record Company, Especially in America,

669
00:47:46,188 --> 00:47:47,625
Went Complete apeshit.

670
00:47:47,625 --> 00:47:50,658
"You Mean wrap Wish You Were Here in Black Opaque Shrink wrap

671
00:47:50,658 --> 00:47:54,130
"you can not See SO IT? Are you completely fucking mad? "

672
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,403
But you HAD to have a Sticker That said What IT was,

673
00:47:57,403 --> 00:48:00,237
otherwise the factory wouldn't pack it properly,

674
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:01,714
let alone the Fans Buy IT.

675
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,862
I Hear Stories That there are some aficionados ...

676
00:48:08,259 --> 00:48:12,410
.. Who have ... Who have HAD HAD Wish You Were Here for many a Year now,

677
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:16,441
and have Carefully slit the Opaque Vinyl Shrink wrap

678
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:18,756
and the Extracted Record

679
00:48:18,756 --> 00:48:21,629
and have not Actually Seen the cover in 35 years.

680
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:25,541
Brilliant. That's really absent.

681
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:41,625
Well, That's the one I CAN quite Clearly Remember .

682
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:47,811
That was me strumming a 12 string guitar,

683
00:48:47,811 --> 00:48:51,124
Which I'd recently Purchased from a Guy I know,

684
00:48:51,124 --> 00:48:53,719
Coming up with and, you know, the opening riff

685
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:55,115
of Wish You Were Here.

686
00:48:58,428 --> 00:48:59,466
And again, Like ...

687
00:48:59,466 --> 00:49:02,499
Like the four Notes at the Beginning of Shine On You Crazy Diamond,

688
00:49:02,499 --> 00:49:04,774
Other People start going, "Hey,

689
00:49:04,774 --> 00:49:06,689
"That's Good, you've got something there."

690
00:49:12,676 --> 00:49:16,308
And I said to HIM, "What's That You're Playing? That's really nice."

691
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:17,985
And He Played IT.

692
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,778
And I said, "That's really Good.

693
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:24,131
"Maybe I Should try and do something with IT."

695
00:49:29,678 --> 00:49:34,349
Those Chords and Putting in to the ... in to the Whole thing, and Roger ...

696
00:49:36,943 --> 00:49:39,696
did .. Those Brilliant Words, and there We Were.

697
00:49:39,696 --> 00:49:44,286
# Did They Get you to Trade your heroes for ghosts

698
00:49:45,803 --> 00:49:47,958
# Hot ashes for trees

699
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:52,069
# Hot Air for a cool Breeze

700
00:49:53,067 --> 00:49:54,983
# Cold comfort for Change

701
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:58,934
# And did you exchange

702
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:01,648
# A Walk on part in the war

703
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:05,160
# For a lead role in a cage? #

704
00:50:13,901 --> 00:50:18,570
That collaboration Between David and I, I think is, you know,

705
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:22,881
really Good. All bits of IT are really, really Good.

706
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:24,557
So I ' m very happy about it.

707
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:38,725
# So, you Think SO CAN tell you

708
00:50:40,801 --> 00:50:43,276
Heaven from hell #

709
00:50:44,832 --> 00:50:47,626
# Blue Skies from Pain

710
00:50:48,624 --> 00:50:50,899
# Can you tell a green Field

711
00:50:52,016 --> 00:50:54,251
# From a Cold, steel rail?

712
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:59,121
# A smile from a Veil?

713
00:50:59,121 --> 00:51:02,074
# Do you Think you CAN tell? #

714
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:04,708
I Think Most of the Songs That I've Ever Written

715
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:08,141
All Pose Similar questions.

716
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:13,928
Can you Free Yourself Enough to be Able to Experience the Reality

717
00:51:13,928 --> 00:51:17,041
of life as IT Goes on before you

718
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:21,551
and with you, and as you go on as Part of IT or not?

719
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:28,456
Because if you can not, you Stand on square one until you die.

720
00:51:28,456 --> 00:51:32,088
And I know That May sound Like Bullshit,

721
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,402
That's What but the Song is About .

722
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:39,910
# How I wish How I wish you Were here

723
00:51:42,425 --> 00:51:46,376
# We're just two lost Souls Swimming in a fish bowl

724
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:48,451
Year After Year #

725
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:54,159
# Running over the Ground Same old

726
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:55,875
# What We have found?

727
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,509
# The Same old fears

728
00:51:58,509 --> 00:52:01,104
# Wish you Were here. #

729
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:05,653
All the Songs are Encouraging me,

730
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:08,128
I guess I write Them for me,

731
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:11,400
and IT's to Encourage Myself ...

732
00:52:12,598 --> 00:52:17,706
.. not to accept a lead role in a cage ...

733
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,974
.. but to go on demanding of Myself

734
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:26,807
That I Keep auditioning

735
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:31,196
for the walk on part in the war, because that's where I want to be.

736
00:52:31,196 --> 00:52:33,910
I Want to be in the trenches.

737
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,864
I do not Want to be at headquarters or I do not Want to be sitting

738
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:38,979
in a Hotel somewhere.

739
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:43,490
I Want to be ... I Want to be Engaged ...

740
00:52:44,647 --> 00:52:47,361
.. Probably, I Might Say,

741
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:50,953
in a way That My father Would Approve of.

742
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:03,206
It's a very simple Sort of Country Song, if you Like.

743
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:06,000
It's still ... Because of resonance ITS

744
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,271
and the emotional IT Carries Weight,

745
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:14,022
IT is one of our best songs.

746
00:53:17,614 --> 00:53:21,844
People do attach to IT Internal Lots of feelings That They May have,

747
00:53:21,844 --> 00:53:26,115
and they may not be entirely sure what it's about, and neither am I.

748
00:53:26,115 --> 00:53:28,988
I Mean, I'm Only telling you What's About IT for me.

749
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,578
But there's no reason why Other People should not put

750
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:38,008
Other Interpretations on IT, Which Could be just as Valid.

751
00:53:42,279 --> 00:53:44,474
Although Shine On You Crazy Diamond

752
00:53:44,474 --> 00:53:47,787
is the one That is specifically About Syd, and Wish You Were Here

754
00:53:51,459 --> 00:53:54,372
.. I can not Sing IT without Thinking About Syd.

755
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:11,614
My Memory is That I Came in to the Studio

756
00:54:11,614 --> 00:54:15,845
and there was this Guy Standing there in a Gabardine raincoat,

757
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:20,754
and a large, large bloke, and I HAD no idea Who was IT.

758
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:24,146
And Surprisingly, no-one's Saying, "Who's That person?

759
00:54:24,146 --> 00:54:27,938
"What's He doing Wandering around All Our gear in the Studio?"

760
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:32,607
And then ... then Coming in to HIM the control room and standing around,

761
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:39,113
and How Remarkable, How Long IT was before anyone woke up Actually.

762
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:45,260
Finally , I think it was David who said, "Nick, do you recognise him?"

763
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:50,967
And I Looked and I Think I shrugged Either My Shoulders

765
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,954
and said, "It's Syd".

766
00:54:56,954 --> 00:54:58,909
And We just Sort of Stood there,

767
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:01,942
or SAT Were there and just Shell-shocked, Basically.

768
00:55:03,619 --> 00:55:06,692
And then until Somebody Thought of something to Say to HIM.

769
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:13,676
And then We Were All unbelievably shocked at HIS appearance.

770
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:18,027
I Mean, I did not Recognise HIM, I did not know IT was HIM.

771
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:19,504
But IT was Pretty ...

772
00:55:22,138 --> 00:55:24,214
.. Pretty Affecting, really.

773
00:55:24,214 --> 00:55:25,889
I Mean, Roger and Dave Cried.

774
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:31,557
You know, this slim, elegant ...

775
00:55:32,795 --> 00:55:37,344
.. if bedraggled and Dazed That person I HAD Last Seen, HAD Turned

776
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:43,252
rather Balloon shaped, and HAD no eyebrows and not much Hair, and ...

777
00:55:53,668 --> 00:55:56,861
And there is the Photograph of HIM in the Studio at the time,

778
00:55:56,861 --> 00:56:01,770
and if you Looked at Syd in Early '67

779
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,402
and then Syd, SO IT was Different.

780
00:56:08,076 --> 00:56:12,147
It was a Great Loss and, you know ...

781
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:18,493
.. Imagining What He Would have gone on to do is. ..

782
00:56:18,493 --> 00:56:22,045
That Speculating on, if you Like, is ...

783
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,759
He Could have SO Become Great.

784
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:11,096
It's kind of nice Actually Standing up here with These Three guys

785
00:57:11,096 --> 00:57:13,851
After All These years.

786
00:57:15,288 --> 00:57:17,921
Standing to be counted with the rest of you.

787
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:24,068
Anyway, we're doing this for everyone Who's not here,

788
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:26,263
but particularly, of Course, for Syd.

789
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:34,445
HE intones

00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:26,151
Classic Albums: PINK FLOYD
- The Dark Side Of The Moon DVD

2
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,502
"Dark Side Of The Moon" was an expression of

3
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,755
political, philosophical, humanitarian empathy

4
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,466
that was desperate to get out.

5
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,241
Dark Side, I think... I felt like
the whole band were working together.

6
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,870
It was a very creative time.
We were very open as well...

7
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,789
...I think because we still had a common goal

8
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:25,627
which was to become rich and famous.

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,142
The ideas that Roger was exploring

10
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:44,021
apply to every new generation.

11
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:49,443
They still have very much
the same relevance as they had.

12
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,918
I think one of the successes of Dark Side is the fact

13
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,755
that actually it's very rich:
there's a... there are a lot of songs,

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,300
a lot of ideas all compressed onto the one record.

15
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:17,262
I can clearly remember that moment

16
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,724
of sitting and listening to the
whole mix all the way through...

17
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:26,813
and thinking: my God, we've really...
done something fantastic here...

18
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,626
I think it has the all-time record,

19
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:53,423
constantly on the charts for nearly
750 weeks, about 14 years.

20
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,592
It was a huge album,

21
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,471
and huge not just in terms of its sales,
but in terms of its influence.

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,724
This was where underground music,

23
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,687
progressive rock, whatever,
really went mainstream.

24
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,439
It was a record that had lots of traditional pop values,

25
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,233
you could sing along to these songs, but

26
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,777
it also was a kind of thing that took you places

27
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,029
if you wanted to listen to it in a darkened room.

28
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,031
It may very will be the ultimate concept record,

29
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,201
because the concept is there, the songs are there,

30
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,287
the spaces and the music are there,

31
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,790
but it doesn't take away any of the imagination.

32
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:37,426
After Syd went crazy in '68 and Dave joined

33
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,930
we were, all of us, searching,
fumbling around,

34
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,807
looking for... "what are we gonna do now?",

35
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:49,521
because here was the guy who
starts producing all these songs,

36
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:53,400
and was the sort of heartbeats of the band.

37
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,903
Syd casts a long and large shadow of events.

38
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,100
I think that the band was very impressive to keep going,

39
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,100
actually, after loss of their main creative drive,

40
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,229
I mean it was the first time you choose, isn't it,

41
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:07,080
I mean you wouldn't sit around say ok
let's give it to the song writer.

42
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:13,045
After Syd had gone the music became
more kind of soundscapes than songs.

43
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,422
You have to watch your strengths,

44
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,718
and it was a very good thing
that we could not write singles,

45
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,846
we might not have done some of the
very interesting work that we did.

46
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:28,769
Once Syd was out of the picture,
the Floyd just went glacial;

47
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:32,648
they just let it all spread out.

48
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,285
When I saw the Floyd for the first time
it was the summer of '68,

49
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,413
it was actually their first American tour with David Gilmour,

50
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:53,001
and they were just extraordinary, you know, it was

51
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:56,129
"Let There Be More Light",
"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun",

52
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:00,008
it was total space rock.

53
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,978
I started fully out of love with

54
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,607
that... some of that psychedelic noodling stuff.

55
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,362
We were still then playing a lot of
instrumental work, if you like,

56
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,364
and that would be half the album.

57
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,616
But we were always searching for a direction.

58
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,410
A fighting a little bit between

59
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:31,623
wanting to push boundaries back a little bit

60
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:35,711
and move forward in an experimental way,

61
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,630
but also to retain melody.

62
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:44,761
When you get to "Meddle",
quite clearly an "Echoes"

63
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:49,808
shows the direction that we were moving in.

64
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,978
The rest of "Meddle" as I recall was songs,

65
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,066
and so in the flip side was a 20-minute piece

66
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:03,864
a) and so was a construct, and

67
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:11,330
b) it was the beginning of
all the writing about other people.

68
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,292
SINGING: Strangers passing in the street,

69
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,046
by chance two separate glances meet,

70
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,761
and I am you and what I see is me

71
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,973
It was the beginning of empathy, if you like, you know,

72
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,393
"two strangers passing in the street,
by chance two passing glances meet,

73
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,646
and I am you and what I see is me"

74
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,233
is a sort of thread that has gone through
everything for me ever since then...

75
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:47,074
... and had a big eruption in Dark Side.

76
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:50,244
You have to remember the context of the time.

77
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,540
This was the height of glam rock: there was,

78
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,543
you know, Marc Bolan,
and T. Rex, and David Bowie with

79
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,588
Ziggy Stardust peddling there, sort of pop fantasies,

80
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,342
and the Floyd came along with an album
that was about these weighty themes.

81
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,763
He created a story, he created a... basically a theater piece

82
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,516
about what it was like to live in the modern world.

83
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,978
All four of us were there,
and there was a discussion about

84
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:20,732
putting the album together
and making it into this "themed",

85
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,610
this... I mean what is now called a "concept", album.

86
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,447
There are a number of things
that impinge upon an individual to...

87
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,410
the... colour his view of existence.

88
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:36,707
There are pressures that are capable of
pushing you one direction or another,

89
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:42,004
and here's some of them... and...
whether they push you towards

90
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:47,467
insanity, death, empathy, greed, whatever

91
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:56,685
there's something about the
Newtonian view of that physics

92
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,063
that might be interesting and may be there could be...

93
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,942
this is what this record is about...

94
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,029
There was one of those really good moments

95
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:08,947
that most bands do experience where everyone is on sight,

96
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,284
and everyone likes the idea, and there's
some sort of agreement as to,

97
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,494
more or less, who's going to do what.

98
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,956
Dark Side Of The Moon started in
a rehearsal room in Bermondsey

99
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,126
I think, that belongs... a warehouse
that belongs to The Rolling Stones

100
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:27,341
where we did some... sort of jammy writing,
whatever you want to call it.

101
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,761
Not sure how much writing happened there.

102
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,681
You know,
let's play in E minor or in A for an hour or two,

103
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,727
oh that sounds all right, that will take up 5 minutes.

104
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,624
A lot of the musical ideas just came up

105
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,127
just to... of jamming away in these rehearsal rooms...

106
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,505
obviously the lyrics Roger brought in...

107
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,382
...because he had things to say.

108
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,385
And it was the first time he wrote all the lyrics...

109
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:14,513
Roger was all sorts of a pushing, driving force...

110
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,349
The way "Dark Side Of The Moon" articulates some sense of

111
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:21,687
early adult's disenchantment is absolutely timeless...

112
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:25,983
I've listened to it again recently, and it always amazes me

113
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:31,029
that I c... that I got away with it really, 'cause it was so

114
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,077
"lower-sixth-t", and... you know... uhm...

115
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,414
"breathe, breathe in the air, don't be afraid to care".

116
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:41,375
"Further thing" within the context of the music

117
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,526
and within the context of the pieces at whole:

118
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:49,673
people are prepared to accept that simple exultation

119
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,509
to be prepared to stand your ground and

120
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:57,014
attempt to live your life in an authentic way.

121
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:24,750
I came from jazz basically... I love it...

122
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,503
That's my favorite... that's my inspiration.

123
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:31,381
And the interesting thing about this song is,
I told you about jazz,

124
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,969
is this certain chord... which is...

125
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,809
that is totally down to a chord
I had heard on actually

126
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:46,063
Miles Davis album "Kind of Blue",

127
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:51,610
which is a... that chord!..
that chord I just loved!

128
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,655
And when we're doing "Breathe",

129
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:58,992
we got to G - I got to G -
and how'd you get to E again?

130
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,957
Well, again, normally you go...

131
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,711
but... uhm... I remember this chord and I remember

132
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,048
working it out at home listening
to the record, and I just thought...

133
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,818
Dave was brilliant at double tracking vocals.

134
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:37,531
And we could do machines,
but it is a difference.

135
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,458
There's also a harmony part...

136
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,421
And that's it how it's sung...

137
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,890
Back to the band!..

138
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,227
There's two organ parts which come in now...

139
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:17,279
They had been performing this work on as "Eclipse"

140
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:23,202
for a few months I think,
before actually even coming in to Abbey Road

141
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,995
to start the first recordings...

142
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,460
...which meant that the performances
were pretty tight and not so hard to get.

143
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,213
When you're working in a band
and you're performing something, it

144
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:39,009
...willy-nilly, it develops and changes...

145
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,952
In pre-bootlegging days this of course was

146
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,579
a far more effective and better way of doing things,

147
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,624
because you went in the studio and rehearsed up.

148
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,930
We'd been playing it live that way for quite some time

149
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,641
as a sort of guitar jam, that sort of a piece.

150
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,853
I think we were none of us
that happy with it as a piece,

151
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,690
and when we also had this synthesizer...

152
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,526
...this Synth EA which had a little built-in keyboard

153
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:40,487
and had a sequencer...
it was the first sequencer I think...

154
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,283
...I just plugged this up and
started playing one sequence on it,

155
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,828
and Roger immediately pricked up his ears
and said that sounded good,

156
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,790
and came up, and we started mocking with it together...

157
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:58,005
and he put in a new sequence of notes,
and all developed out of that...

158
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:02,342
A series of notes played in slowly...

159
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:06,221
triggering a noise generator and oscillators,

160
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,642
and then just speed it up, you know...

161
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:17,399
You've got it basically...

162
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:23,989
And that, of course, immediately sounded

163
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:27,492
much more exciting than what we were currently doing.

164
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,329
They were the first band to really go out

165
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,998
and try to sort of make music off the future.

166
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,875
We were doing a lot of things with tape loops

167
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,835
and curious sounds and sound effects...

168
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,755
There wasn't something in 1972
when they put that album together.

169
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,757
But that's basically what they were doing.

170
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,092
They were... in a sense they were giving you a preview

171
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,720
of the sound pictures of the future.

172
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,059
You know, there are some very very clever

173
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:54,937
and highly listenable pieces
of sonic experimentation.

174
00:14:55,604 --> 00:14:59,483
So this is the main synthesizer,
it has the high-hat element built-in.

175
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,069
Then we treated with filters and with

176
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,239
other oscillators to get this sort of vibrato noise.

177
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:09,284
And we're bringing this guitar,
it's a backwards guitar with echoes...,

178
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,871
it's been played with a mike stand leg, just sliding up...

179
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:20,462
That was left-to-right across the stereo.
And there's these synthesizers,

180
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:25,259
Morph synth's, which are creating
sort of futuristic vehicle noises,

181
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:29,555
which you take the pitch down a little bit,
and pan it at the same time...

182
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,890
That creates an artificial Doppler sound,

183
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,768
what looks like ambulance is whizzing past you...

184
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:40,858
bringing some footsteps...
and some heartbeats for extra tension...

185
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,778
As you see there's an awful lot going on this track...

186
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:57,833
This section in particular,

187
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,294
"The Travel" section or "On The Run" section

188
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,505
I think was pretty complicated.

189
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,341
A lot of hands on deck...

190
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,428
You do always want to put more things on
than you had tracks for...

191
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,765
So tracks would very suddenly change
from one thing to a different thing

192
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,851
All of us were on the desk,

193
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,769
I think as on the faders

194
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,271
But that's the way it was, because

195
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,148
we didn't have automation in those days...

196
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,859
A mix in those days was a performance,

197
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,278
every bit as much as doing a gig.

198
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:27,821
It's one thing actually that

199
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,824
we've kind of lost in the modern age.

200
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:47,424
Very very well-engineered,

201
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,427
it was also very very carefully constructed.

202
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,181
... you know everything was well-recorded.

203
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,308
Dark Side was really the first

204
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,603
proper engineering job
I'd been given with the Floyd.

205
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,523
So there was pretty much putting on the deep end.

206
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:04,066
It was very great musically as well.

207
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,778
He also came up with a couple of good ideas.

208
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:12,282
I was commissioned to record
some clocks for sound effects,

209
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:16,203
record for the very early days of quadrophony.

210
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,498
And when we were doing "Time"

211
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,376
he suggested we might like to have these clocks.

212
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,463
My memory of it is just this room
full of tapes rolling around,

213
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,760
because it was without any sort of computer help,

214
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,137
everything had to be done manually.

215
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:38,892
Getting all the clocks to chime
at the right time - that was a process

216
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,814
of just finding a particular moment
on the multi-track tape

217
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,108
where all the chiming would happen, and then

218
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,944
back-timing the quarter-inch originals

219
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:51,321
which contained each of the clocks...

220
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:55,242
And then the very critical thing of
tapes starting at specific lengths,

221
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,913
which was all done with hand signs and stop-watches.

222
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:33,864
We got the girls making their first appearance here...

223
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:40,704
That's un-processed...

224
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:48,587
And we actually put this effect
called a frequency translation on,

225
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:52,216
which made them sound like this...

226
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:01,975
Here is the solo...

227
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,964
This one was probably taking some shape live

228
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,882
before we ever got to doing it,

229
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,343
but usually in the studio on this sort of thing

230
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:41,306
you just have a player over it and see what comes,

231
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,726
and it's usually and mostly the first tape is the best one,

232
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,813
and you find yourself repeating yourself thereafter.

233
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:06,373
The 1970s was the era of the guitar.

234
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:11,837
And he had that sort of very "bluesy" sound

235
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,256
but then also he had that other sound,

236
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:20,095
that sort of spacey, very crystalline,
almost ethereal quality.

237
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:58,467
I suddenly realized then that year
that life was already happening.

238
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:02,638
I excuse my mother was so obsessed with education

239
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,058
and the idea that childhood and adolescence and...

240
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:11,688
well, everything was about preparing
for a life that was going to start later.

241
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:17,402
And I suddenly realized that life wasn't going to start later,

242
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:22,366
that it is... you know, it starts at dot
and it happens all the time, and then...

243
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:29,540
at any point you can grasp the reins
and start guiding your own destiny.

244
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:33,669
And that was a big revelation to me,
I mean, it came as quite a shock.

245
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,694
One of the greatest lines I think
on "Dark Side Of The Moon"

246
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:03,156
is Roger's line about
"hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way",

247
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:06,535
which is a sort of line you could imagine - I don't know -

248
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,454
Evelyn Waugh or Somerset Maugham or someone writing

249
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:12,332
as an observation on the English character.

250
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:16,461
And I think that character does permiate the whole record,

251
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,257
and indeed the whole of Pink Floyd's career.

252
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:19,066
It expresses my feelings about things very simply.

253
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:24,112
And I think that musically...

254
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:29,243
I think that the music is the "sum-mix-ten"

255
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:34,373
driven by that emotional commitment.

256
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,336
The band basically wanted another
4 or 5 minutes of music,

257
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:42,422
and we thought it could be an instrumental.

258
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:45,843
I think I just - as I always have done
- is I sat at the piano...

259
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:49,429
and I... and those first two chords came.

260
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,890
"Us And Them" and
"The Great Gig In The Sky",

261
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,934
you know, are fabulous chord sequences,

262
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:57,688
are really truly wonderful pieces of music.

263
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:48,090
I've no idea whose idea it was
to get somebody as a female singer and...

264
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:52,302
but Alan Parsons knew Clare Torry
and had been working with her,

265
00:25:52,553 --> 00:25:53,679
and said why don't you try her...

266
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,889
She's just went in there and improvised over.

267
00:25:56,014 --> 00:25:57,891
Yeah, that was amazing, that was fantastic!

268
00:25:58,058 --> 00:25:59,518
But that was a moreover mixing.

269
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,646
We knew what we wanted, not exactly musically,

270
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,815
but we knew that we wanted someone to just

271
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:09,570
improvise over this piece. So we directed her

272
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:12,114
...: "think about death, think about horror,

273
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,783
think whatever, and just go and sing".

274
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,912
And my memory is, that she went out in the studio

275
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,208
and did it very very quickly,
and then came back in and said:

276
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:26,712
"I'm really sorry about this", very embarrassed.

277
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,299
And we in fact were sitting in the studio saying:
"This is wonderful".

278
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:33,218
And of course it's absolutely brilliant,

279
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:36,638
both Rick's piano and organ work,

280
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:42,895
and Clare's singing is just incredibly moving.

281
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,617
In the very end of this, I remember,

282
00:26:56,825 --> 00:27:00,037
we increased the echo slowly.

283
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:39,493
We always wanted to kind of

284
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:43,080
not be on our covers ourselves, not have pictures.

285
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:46,583
It is probably the most recognizable
album cover of all time.

286
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,669
It's something that you can sit and look at

287
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,671
for a long time without getting fed up with it.

288
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:54,967
The prism is the logo that absolutely defines the record.

289
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:59,388
Dark Side Of The Moon prism design
comes from 3 basic ingredients,

290
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,473
one of which is the light show

291
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,852
that the band put on tour and
trying to represent and also

292
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,355
one of the themes were lyrics which was, I think,

293
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,275
about ambition and greed; and the third

294
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,110
it was an answer to Rick Wright

295
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:14,736
who said that he wanted something...

296
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,531
...simple and bold, and dramatic...

297
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:19,408
The presentation, as we call it,

298
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:24,204
of the design to the band was a very brief affair.

299
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,332
He just brought in 3 or 4 ideas...

300
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:30,377
I do remember instantly seeing the pyramid...

301
00:28:30,502 --> 00:28:32,254
They came in and they looked around,

302
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,506
and they went: "mmm, that one!"

303
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,175
Everyone immediately went:

304
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,136
"Terrific! Great! Let's do that".

305
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,764
As epitomized by there but it did
choose it so quickly and so easily is,

306
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,600
I just think it is somehow very fitting,

307
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,977
I mean, it's hard to imagine it
without it, isn't it really?

308
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:01,408
The story in America... of disaster that

309
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:05,621
really we hadn't sold records. And like all good artists

310
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,207
the first thing you do is blame the record company.

311
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:12,669
But in this particular case, I think
we might get a few more people to agree

312
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,339
that they hadn't performed properly.

313
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:18,759
And so there was a... man called Bhaskar Menon

314
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:20,427
who was absolutely terrific.

315
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,429
And he decided he was going to make this work

316
00:29:22,596 --> 00:29:25,057
and he was going to make the American company

317
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,727
sell this record. And he did!

318
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:32,648
We devised a marketing campaign for this, which was

319
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:37,110
far more extensive than anything
that the company had ever done.

320
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:41,657
It was an album that came after
virtually a year of touring.

321
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,328
There was a tremendous amount of credible press.

322
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:51,375
We got by this time without a single
got this album tremendous sales,

323
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,961
close to about a million albums by that stage,

324
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:55,712
which was quite remarkable.

325
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:57,965
And I knew that the time would come when

326
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:01,593
we would have to get on to the next stage,

327
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,805
to get to the next category or level of audience.

328
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,892
We really would need some single-like material.

329
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:13,146
They always say, you know, you need a hit single

330
00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:15,649
and we had a sort of hit single with Money.

331
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:38,755
You know, I would have remembered

332
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,760
writing Money as a sort of very "bluesy" thing.

333
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:47,055
I can't sing that up in that register of that...

334
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,382
And there's a very kind of transatlantic,

335
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:26,136
bluesy sort of twang to it all.
Listen to the original demo -

336
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:30,933
it's not like that at all, it's all
very kind of prissy and very English.

337
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:32,559
The one thing about Money that

338
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:36,313
I think people forget is that it's got the weirdest...

339
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,233
it's one of the biggest hits
with the weirdest time signature.

340
00:31:39,525 --> 00:31:44,947
Very unusual 7/8 time. Good riff.

341
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,672
I'd played in a band with Dick when we were

342
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,550
a sort of teenagers in Cambridge.

343
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:47,676
Dick was...

344
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,469
was sort of a part of the Cambridge mafia.

345
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,268
I didn't know any other sax players but then probably

346
00:32:56,476 --> 00:32:59,188
too nervous to ask anyone other before he'd turn off.

347
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:01,231
He was terrific.

348
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,568
Well Dick did his sax solo in the 7/8 time.

349
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:07,112
And then we sort of sat and worked out

350
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,115
a different sequence for the guitar solo,

351
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:12,409
probably to make my life easier

352
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,244
so I didn't have to think about the timing.

353
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:16,955
I love the fact that it does change.

354
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,339
Let me say that lots of things happened

355
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,210
on Dark Side Of The Moon are kind of magical...

356
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,129
without us intentionally making them happen.

357
00:33:24,505 --> 00:33:27,674
It just happened. And I think that's one of the great things

358
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:30,469
about Money is that it does change time signatures.

359
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:32,971
And that's the thing: he goes back into the 4/4

360
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,641
and all of a sudden - man, it's rock city!

361
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:21,019
Money is an amazing single because it's about

362
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,565
the very thing that it became - it's about success.

363
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,650
Something certainly did the trick and it

364
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:31,113
moved us up into a super league,
I suppose you might say,

365
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:41,707
which brought with it some great joy,
some pride and some... problems.

366
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:45,002
Of course it changed our life and we were now

367
00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:48,130
a big rock-n-roll band playing at stadiums.

368
00:34:48,255 --> 00:34:50,591
You don't know what you're in it for anymore.

369
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,760
You know, you're in it to achieve massive success and

370
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,223
get rich and famous and all these
other things that go along with it.

371
00:34:58,307 --> 00:35:01,518
And when they're all suddenly done

372
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:05,439
you're going... mhm huh well... why... what next?

373
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:07,608
It's not to say we didn't do some good work,

374
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:10,694
but the good work we did was actually all about

375
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:14,948
a lot of the negative aspects of
what went on after we'd achieved...

376
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:18,744
...the goal.

377
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:20,996
I mean that obviously informed what

378
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:24,333
turned out to be the next album quiet deeply

379
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,711
"Wish You Were Here" - because we weren't,

380
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:29,463
most of us most of the time.

381
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:31,298
They were a platinum monster

382
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:34,968
and it's not a lot of fun.

383
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:48,524
Sort of amazing to me now that
we had that piece of music

384
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:53,612
in 1969 when we recorded
the music for Zabriskie Point.

385
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:56,824
And throughout, I guess, Atom Heart Mother,

386
00:35:57,074 --> 00:36:00,327
the "Obscured By Clouds" album,
the "Meddle" album

387
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:04,248
we didn't dig it out and use it,
such a lovely piece of music.

388
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:17,928
Antonioni didn't really know what he wanted.

389
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:20,222
He needed desperately to have control.

390
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:23,517
So even if you did the right thing and it was perfect

391
00:36:23,684 --> 00:36:26,854
he couldn't bear to accept it
because there wasn't a choice.

392
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,730
All he really wanted was

393
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:30,315
"Careful With That Axe, Eugene."

394
00:36:30,482 --> 00:36:33,485
I think we were all getting a bit frustrated
of "what does he want?".

395
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:36,321
I think I was just sitting in the studio and

396
00:36:36,405 --> 00:36:38,157
I was seeing the piano and I happened

397
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,784
to have that Violent Sequence up

398
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:45,164
and I was watching it and
perhaps I felt a bit tired or whatever,

399
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,292
I just started the chord sequence.

400
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,129
At the time I think everyone thought:
this is really good.

401
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:57,384
When we thought we'd really got
something brilliant for his movie,

402
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,055
Antonioni would say...

403
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:05,976
"It's beautiful, but is too sad",
you know,

404
00:37:06,143 --> 00:37:08,061
"It makes me think of church".

405
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:13,150
It was obviously waiting to be reborn in this album.

406
00:37:20,032 --> 00:37:22,868
The lyrics are so direct and linear:

407
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:26,622
those fundamental issues of whether or not

408
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:30,375
the human race is capable of being humane.

409
00:37:32,628 --> 00:37:35,047
What's good about the writing of this song, from my point of view,

410
00:37:35,172 --> 00:37:39,051
is the leaving of the gaps for the repeat echo.

411
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,607
It's kind of strange hearing it without it...
without the echoes in it.

412
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:18,924
I find myself with instrumentalists
over the years working with people

413
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:23,428
having very-very often
as a producer in my capacity

414
00:38:23,637 --> 00:38:26,181
for producing records having to say to people:

415
00:38:27,057 --> 00:38:31,103
now leave the whole, now just play for half a bar

416
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,940
and then leave a bar and a half free, empty.

417
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:39,653
And that's kind of what that song is,
that's the way it works.

418
00:38:39,661 --> 00:38:42,698
The simplicity of Floyd is really almost hard to talk about

419
00:38:42,823 --> 00:38:48,620
because it is so simple.
Nick Mason playing very slowly, you know,

420
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:57,546
exact, without a lot of overly
freely percussion flourishes.

421
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:01,884
Richard's touch on piano, on organ - very gentle,

422
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:07,723
very soft, but also exact,
and just hitting the notes right.

423
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,517
It was always about leaving space.

424
00:39:31,497 --> 00:39:33,290
I think, Dave and Rick -

425
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:36,001
their harmony vocals on it are really very affecting.

426
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,378
Funny enough, they have similar voices,

427
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,923
both their voices are a big factor in

428
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:44,218
Dark Side Of The Moon the way they "planned".

429
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,932
That's Dave and Rick together.

430
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:53,352
Then Rick does another part lower that he did.

431
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:57,356
And then the girls are also joining in.

432
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,512
"I mean, they're not gonna kill ya,

433
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,640
so if you give 'em a quick short sharp shock

434
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:34,893
they don't do it again. Dig it?
I mean he got off lightly,

435
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:38,021
'cos I could've given him a thrashing.
I only hit him once!

436
00:40:38,105 --> 00:40:39,898
It was only a difference
of right and wrong, ain't it?

437
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:42,609
I mean good manners don't cost nothing,
do they, eh?"

438
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:46,321
It seemed to me really important... I can't...

439
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:50,826
I've no idea why to have voices on this thing.

440
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,287
And so the only thing that was clever about it at all

441
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,665
was how to do it, so note to have an interview.

442
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,959
Devised probably in the canteen

443
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:02,421
and done later that evening.

444
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:04,464
So I wrote a bunch of cards

445
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:06,425
with the questions on them.

446
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:08,594
I think what the voices did on the record was

447
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,888
they actually brought out the dark side,

448
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,890
they were in a way the dark side of the record.

449
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:15,017
First, we used a number of people

450
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,894
who worked in the studio with us,

451
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,354
so we used 3 or 4 of our road crew.

452
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,565
I ain't frightened of dying at all,

453
00:41:21,815 --> 00:41:23,734
'cause when you gotta go - you gotta go

454
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:25,819
Irish doorman Gerry:

455
00:41:25,944 --> 00:41:28,113
"Why should I be frightened of dying?

456
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:30,949
There's no reason for it, you gotta go some time".

457
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:33,243
"Wings" were recording in here at the same time

458
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,704
so we actually used Paul and Linda,
Henry McCullough:

459
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,081
"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time".

460
00:41:38,582 --> 00:41:41,752
It's the people who are
not used to being interviewed,

461
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,337
who come up with the stuff.

462
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:44,838
I think they started off with

463
00:41:44,963 --> 00:41:48,967
"what's your favorite color?",
and "your favorite food?"

464
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,386
And when none of which was just to get people there...

465
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,972
and then they went into
"when was the last time you were violent?"

466
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,184
This was the good bit:
"when was the last time you were violent?"

467
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:01,396
and then you'd take...
you'd answer it and take the next card,

468
00:42:01,522 --> 00:42:03,565
the next card said: "were you in the right?"

469
00:42:03,732 --> 00:42:06,443
"Yeah, heh heh, I was in the right"

470
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,779
"Yes, absolutely in the right!"

471
00:42:08,862 --> 00:42:10,781
"I certainly was in the right!"

472
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,282
"Yeah, I was definitely in the right,

473
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,867
that geezer was cruising for a bruising"

474
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,496
And this remarkable roadie called Roger the Hat

475
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:20,165
"If I participate in this fucking effort, I... gonna get

476
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,461
my gold disc at the end of it, imagine that, ahhh!

477
00:42:25,546 --> 00:42:28,215
They were trying to track him down to do the cards.

478
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:30,259
By the time they got all of them, somebody...

479
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,761
the cards had gone missing,
I don't know where they'd gone.

480
00:42:33,262 --> 00:42:36,056
So Roger Waters actually didn't that doing it,

481
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,891
he actually did that one as an interview.

482
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:42,688
So,... you think you came mad, Roger?

483
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:47,818
"I want three c-stage" in my life they are as completely convinced

484
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:51,321
had gone over the brinkle but that's why I cad to call it...

485
00:43:05,294 --> 00:43:08,130
It was obviously a bit to do with Syd, and

486
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:14,970
I think it's about defending the notion of being different.

487
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:23,849
The fundamental question that's facing us all is

488
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:27,519
whether or not we're capable of dealing

489
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:29,563
with the whole question of "Us and Them"

490
00:45:29,771 --> 00:45:32,191
What he was feeling as an individual

491
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:37,112
mirrored almost exactly what a lot of other people

492
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:39,072
were feeling at the time of their own lives.

493
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:40,616
There's no question in my mind that

494
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:42,367
Dark Side of the Moon was one of the most important

495
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:44,870
artistic statements of the last fifty years probably.

496
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,749
It touched very many people all over the world

497
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:52,377
in ways that could not simply
be put down "the fact" that:

498
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,172
"oh, the nice tunes" and
"oh, I like that bit at the end"

499
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,382
I mean, this was a complete experience.

500
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,635
It was actually a really grim time,

501
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:06,350
and he wrote a very grim record but did it with music

502
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:11,146
that was extremely uplifting and
compelling and bewitching

503
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:14,900
I think it was a very very happy and creative

504
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,694
and enjoyable time when we made this album.

505
00:46:17,861 --> 00:46:21,657
It was probably the most focused moment in our career

506
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:25,160
in terms of all of us working together as a band.

507
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:30,833
I'd love to have been a person
who could sit back with his headphones on,

508
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:35,379
listen to that the whole way through for the first time,

509
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,757
I mean I had never had this experience,

510
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:41,035
I tell you, it would've been nice.

511
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:42,650
The thing that's often missed is the fact

512
00:46:42,696 --> 00:46:45,681
that basically people respond to that on the

513
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:49,000
emotional level, and that's what makes great records.

514
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,895
It is driven by emotion,

515
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:54,481
there's nothing plastic about it, you know,

516
00:46:54,606 --> 00:46:57,609
there is nothing contrived about it,

517
00:46:57,693 --> 00:46:59,278
and, I think that's what is giving it its...

518
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:04,366
or maybe one of the things
those giving it - its longevity

519
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:21,902
But that's not to say that potential for
the sun to shine does not exist, You know,

520
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,488
Walk down the path towards the light

521
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:27,282
rather than walking to the darkness.

522
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:29,827
There is no dark side on the moon really,

523
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:32,955
matter of fact it's all dark...

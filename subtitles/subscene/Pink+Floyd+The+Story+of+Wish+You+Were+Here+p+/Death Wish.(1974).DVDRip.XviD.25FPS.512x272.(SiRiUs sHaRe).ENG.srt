1
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,562
Hold it right there.

2
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:26,642
Hold it again.

3
00:00:27,409 --> 00:00:29,001
Come on, Paul.

4
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:34,202
One more.

5
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:44,604
- You won't show those to anyone.
- Why? You've got a prime figure.

6
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,199
- You really have.
- That's a euphemism for "fat."

7
00:00:58,369 --> 00:01:00,837
Wanna go back to the hotel?

8
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,006
What's wrong with right here?

9
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,288
We're too civilised.

10
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:10,200
I remember when we weren't.

11
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,964
But we'll go back to the hotel.

12
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,199
I don't wanna go back home.

13
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:48,798
Passengers on TW 76
from Honolulu to New York...

14
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:52,797
...should proceed from the check-in
counter to boarding.

15
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:35,598
Wanna know what was happening
while you were living it up in Maui?

16
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:39,518
There were 15 murders the
first week and 21 last week.

17
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:41,043
That's a lot.

18
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:44,201
Decent people will have to
live elsewhere.

19
00:04:44,449 --> 00:04:47,122
You mean, people who can afford to.

20
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,998
Christ. You're such
a bleeding-heart liberal.

21
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,717
For the underprivileged, yeah.

22
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:57,279
The underprivileged
are beating our brains out.

23
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:00,646
I say, stick them
in concentration camps.

24
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,242
- Henry.
- Hello.

25
00:05:02,489 --> 00:05:07,609
I'm running cost and profit on the
Jainchill development in Arizona.

26
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:13,242
Based on the figures, I don't see how
Blueridge can underwrite 50 percent.

27
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:17,801
Jainchill has been very successful
in a small way.

28
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,003
I suggest you send a man down from our
San Francisco office to step it out...

29
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:25,843
...redesign it if necessary.

30
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,399
Because that's a high risk
for the acreage involved.

31
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,484
I'll talk to Ing about it.
Thanks, Paul.

32
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:39,884
Oh, how does it feel to be back
in the war zone after Hawaii?

33
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:45,249
Good until I ran into Sam and he
delivered the crime rates statistics.

34
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,798
We need more cops than people.

35
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:52,600
You'll have to find other options.
No one could pay the taxes.

36
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:32,437
$2.17.

37
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:35,603
Would you have these delivered, Mary?

38
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,208
Hey, I'm gonna do a thing.

39
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:09,005
- Shit, man, got business.
- Let's go, man.

40
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:32,404
I'll get it.

41
00:08:40,249 --> 00:08:41,443
Who is it?

42
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:43,043
Groceries, ma'am.

43
00:09:02,489 --> 00:09:04,480
Nobody gets hurt. Don't move.

44
00:09:04,729 --> 00:09:08,165
- What do you want?
- You know what we want.

45
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:11,008
- You won't hurt us?
- Not if you got money.

46
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:13,998
Nobody, nobody.

47
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:21,326
Look at the artiste doing his art.
Ain't that beautiful?

48
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,407
- My purse is in the kitchen.
- Stand still.

49
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,006
We'll do as they say, Carol.
Where's your purse?

50
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:37,445
You only got 4 bucks.

51
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,839
I got 3 and 2 bits.

52
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:42,643
You gonna get the shit
kicked out of you.

53
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:47,238
- It's all we have.
- Rich people like you? We want money!

54
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,605
It's true! That's all we have!

55
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:54,526
- Wanna get fucked?
- No!

56
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:57,806
I'm gonna stab you in the ass.

57
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:01,998
Leave her alone!

58
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,677
Goddamn rich cunt!

59
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,806
I kill rich cunts!

60
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,921
Mother's getting the shit
kicked out of her.

61
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,959
Let's screw this one.

62
00:10:24,169 --> 00:10:28,208
- No, man. Let's travel.
- No, man, let me paint her ass.

63
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:39,406
I'll show you how to paint.

64
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm gonna pee into her mouth.

65
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,003
Pee into her mouth.

66
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,598
I hope she likes my paintbrush.

67
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:50,084
Swallow all that pink, honey.

68
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,081
Open her goddamn mouth!

69
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:54,884
Eat it, bitch!

70
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:57,245
I'm gonna bust her mouth!

71
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,885
Mother's going for the phone!

72
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,799
Shit! Let's split.

73
00:11:31,409 --> 00:11:34,401
Will you get my wife
on the phone, please?

74
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:36,402
Mr. Kersey's office.

75
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,798
- Is it my wife?
- No, sir, it's your son-in-law.

76
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:48,838
Hello, Jack.

77
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,286
Dad. Dad, we got trouble.

78
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,407
You and Carol?
Don't tell me about it.

79
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,004
No...

80
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:03,329
...it's Mom and Carol. They're taking
them to emergency receiving.

81
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,242
- What the hell for?
- I don't know.

82
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,087
The police just called.

83
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,605
- What's happening?
- I don't know any more.

84
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:14,687
I'm going to the hospital.
Meet me there.

85
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,404
- How are they?
- I don't know, I just got here.

86
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,642
You know anything?
Were they cut, stabbed, what?

87
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,641
No, sir. Just beat up.

88
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,006
This is Officer Joe Charles.
He came in the ambulance.

89
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:42,281
- They gonna be all right?
- I told him all I know.

90
00:12:42,489 --> 00:12:46,607
If there's anything I can do,
ask for me at the 21st Precinct.

91
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:48,443
Come on, Dad.

92
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:50,600
What did they tell you?

93
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,803
- Not much.
- Well, what?

94
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:58,402
- They beat them both up.
- Who did? Why?

95
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:02,045
Take it easy.
I'm just as rattled as you.

96
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:05,406
The officer said
Carol wasn't making sense.

97
00:13:05,609 --> 00:13:11,206
Maybe three men. She opened the door
thinking it was the delivery boy.

98
00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,205
Jesus. God.

99
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,603
When are we gonna know something?

100
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:28,598
They know we're here?

101
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,238
The nurses know.
I spoke to one of them.

102
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:36,609
There's a man over there,
he's bleeding and nobody comes.

103
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,840
Nurse, what happened
to my wife and daughter?

104
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,209
- A doctor will see you after his exam.
- We've been waiting a long time.

105
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,124
It hasn't been that long.
Just two or three minutes.

106
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:55,520
- Mr. Toby?
- Yes.

107
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:58,522
Your wife is all right.
We've sedated her.

108
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,728
My name is Paul Kersey.
How's my wife?

109
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:07,008
I'm sorry, she died
a few minutes ago, Mr. Kersey.

110
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:15,804
Almighty God, we commend to you
our neighbor, Joanna...

111
00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:21,920
...trusting your mercy and believing
in the resurrection to eternal life...

112
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:26,606
...through our
Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

113
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:31,604
Almighty God, Father of the whole
family in heaven and on earth...

114
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,800
...stand by those who sorrow...

115
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:36,807
...that on your strength,
they may be upheld...

116
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:40,439
...and believe the good news
of life beyond life...

117
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:45,558
...through Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.

118
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,685
I'm going back with Sam and Adel.
They go right by my place.

119
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:12,799
- Don't you wanna come to our apartment?
- It's time I went to my own.

120
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,848
Baby?

121
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:18,807
Baby?

122
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:22,043
I'm going back with Sam.

123
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,598
You get plenty of rest.

124
00:15:30,609 --> 00:15:32,804
She'll be all right, Dad.

125
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,601
Residents will need time to dig
themselves out of a snowstorm...

126
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:08,802
...that's taking many counties
by surprise.

127
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:13,440
In New York City, light snow flurries
lingering till midnight...

128
00:16:13,689 --> 00:16:16,647
- Turn that off.
- Why haven't you found my dog?

129
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,440
He's vital to my income. He paints
marvellous pictures with his paws.

130
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:27,286
- Yes?
- Where can I find Officer Charles?

131
00:16:27,489 --> 00:16:30,128
- What's your business?
- I'm Paul Kersey.

132
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:36,205
Couple days ago my wife and daughter
were attacked. He was on the scene.

133
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,083
Is Joe Charles there,
or has he gone on duty yet?

134
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:46,242
Someone out here
wants to talk to him.

135
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,239
Have a seat, he'll be right out.

136
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:55,405
- Came up from behind me.
Do I have a description?

137
00:16:55,569 --> 00:16:59,847
- The man came from behind me.
- You didn't see who it was?

138
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:03,206
- Hello, Mr. Kersey.
- Officer Charles.

139
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:07,408
Any information on the people
who attacked my family?

140
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,407
I'll take you
to the detective in charge.

141
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:25,327
Lieutenant, this is Paul Kersey, case
884. Wife and daughter assaulted.

142
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,638
Mr. Kersey.

143
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:30,768
I'm going on duty now,
so I'll leave you.

144
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:33,800
Will you have a seat?

145
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:37,600
Have you found out anything?

146
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:44,527
Supermarket security and one of the
checkers remembers three characters.

147
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:50,799
But they haven't been able
to pick the faces out of a mug book.

148
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:56,037
- How is your daughter, Mr. Kersey?
- She's under doctor's sedation.

149
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:02,125
But today I had the funeral for
my wife and she was able to make that.

150
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,447
Your daughter
didn't give much information.

151
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:08,806
We wish she would take a look
at the mug books.

152
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:11,045
Did she refuse?

153
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:15,919
Her husband asked us to wait. But
the sooner she looks at the books...

154
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:19,405
...the better chance she has
of recalling their faces.

155
00:18:19,609 --> 00:18:23,443
I'll talk to my son-in-law,
see what can be done.

156
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:25,998
I'd appreciate that.

157
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:29,605
Is there any chance
of catching these men?

158
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,287
There's a chance, sure.

159
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:34,522
Just a chance?

160
00:18:34,769 --> 00:18:38,125
I'd be less than honest
if I gave you more hope.

161
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:41,805
In the city, that's the way it is.

162
00:18:52,249 --> 00:18:54,399
I thought you were asleep.

163
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:00,488
Are you getting
the most out of life?

164
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:03,641
Are you satisfied,
fulfilled, happy?

165
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:07,199
Our bank has helped many
to a better future.

166
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,166
- Morning, Mr. Kersey.
- Morning.

167
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:05,598
Give me $20 in quarters, please.

168
00:20:19,049 --> 00:20:21,199
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning.

169
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,999
You really are tough.
I told Ives you'd come in.

170
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:32,205
I said you're not the kind to leave
pieces of his life lying around.

171
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:35,009
Just a matter of keeping busy.

172
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,843
- Paul, welcome back.
- Morning, Henry.

173
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,761
- Lunch, Paul?
- Sure.

174
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:46,042
Paul, I'm giving you a vacation.
From New York, that is.

175
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,407
The Jainchill development
in Tucson, Arizona.

176
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:55,000
Take it over. Redesign it
if necessary. Whatever you have to.

177
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:56,403
All right?

178
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:02,440
Can I answer in a week? I don't wanna
leave New York now because of Carol.

179
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:06,045
Fine. When you're ready,
let me know.

180
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:09,998
A beautiful place, Tucson.
They can breathe out there.

181
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:21,007
She's sleeping too much.

182
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,006
It's not normal.

183
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:28,044
I've got TV dinners in the oven.
Just be a couple of minutes.

184
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:32,002
This drink's enough for me.

185
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,724
- You never drink without eating.
- I'm not hungry.

186
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:41,282
I think you ought to take Carol
to see another doctor.

187
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:45,841
I did. Today. A psychiatrist.

188
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:50,128
He feels it might help if I
took her to another environment.

189
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:53,918
Out of New York.
On the shore someplace.

190
00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,888
Sounds good. I'll go along with you.

191
00:21:57,129 --> 00:22:00,644
No, Dad. He felt it best...

192
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:05,280
...if she didn't associate with
anyone who reminded her of that day.

193
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:09,841
- How do I remind her of that day?
- You know how it is, Dad.

194
00:22:10,089 --> 00:22:12,398
It happened at your apartment.

195
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,645
And you're living there.

196
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:17,403
You remind her of Mom.

197
00:22:18,969 --> 00:22:22,200
Dad, don't make it tough for me.

198
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,608
Okay, I'll make it easy for you.

199
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,119
Ives asked me to go to
Tucson, Arizona on a job.

200
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:31,405
How long will you be gone?

201
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,839
I don't know till I look it over.

202
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,649
But you call,
let me know how Carol is.

203
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:40,006
Well, sure I will, Dad.

204
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,480
I hear Tucson's
a really beautiful place.

205
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:45,839
That's what everybody says.

206
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,600
How are you today, sir?

207
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:40,319
All right, you son of a bitch.

208
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:42,605
Turn around, son of a bitch.

209
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,204
Motherfucker, I said turn around.

210
00:23:45,449 --> 00:23:47,201
Now hand me the money.

211
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:12,205
- Paul Kersey.
- Yeah.

212
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,401
- Ames Jainchill.
- How do you do, Mr. Jainchill?

213
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,327
Ames. I'll call you Paul.

214
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:21,039
- How'd you know who I was?
- You look like a New Yorker.

215
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:38,601
Howdy, Judd.

216
00:25:45,969 --> 00:25:51,089
Wanted you to see this country
before you looked at the drawings.

217
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:52,921
Give you a better idea.

218
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:57,401
I don't wanna change these hills,
don't wanna bulldoze them flat.

219
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:02,402
You'll waste a lot of building space.

220
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,127
Wasting space.

221
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:10,443
Those are words you big developers
have to change for something else.

222
00:26:10,689 --> 00:26:11,804
Such as?

223
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:15,007
Space for life.
Like old Judd up there.

224
00:26:15,209 --> 00:26:18,838
Space for people, for horses, cows.

225
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:23,198
I got funny ideas
about building things.

226
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:33,807
Welcome to Old Tucson,
the famous movie studio.

227
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,721
Let's wet our whistle
before I trot you back to the motel.

228
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:42,808
- Boardwalks of the Red Dog Café,
the Gunsmith Shop...

229
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:46,564
- What's happening here?
- That's a phoney Western town.

230
00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:51,001
They shoot movies here, but the rest
of the time it's for tourists.

231
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,201
This is where the performance
will take place.

232
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:57,128
This fellow's good, you wanna watch?

233
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:59,169
- Where the Wild West lives again.

234
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:00,238
- Where the Wild West lives again.

235
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:04,198
- Where's the marshal?
- He's in the bank.

236
00:27:04,449 --> 00:27:07,202
- What do you got in mind to do?
- You steal my horse.

237
00:27:07,449 --> 00:27:09,519
That's a good trick.

238
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,808
You spot yourself on the porch,
while I draw the marshal out.

239
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,607
Hey, marshal!

240
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:19,205
- What's the matter?
- Somebody stole my horse.

241
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:21,804
I told you
to get out of town by sunset!

242
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:27,077
You missing a mare that was tied
to the rail? I saw a fella take him.

243
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:31,322
- What'd he look like?
- Well, he was about this tall...

244
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:33,207
Get him, Frank!

245
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,808
Let's put him inside and get to the
bank and make that withdrawal.

246
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:07,403
All right, boys. The fun's over.

247
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,800
Throw out your guns
and put your hands up!

248
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,523
Listen up, marshal.
I've got dynamite.

249
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:15,487
Don't be a fool.

250
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:34,806
The outlaw life seemed a shortcut
to easy money...

251
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:37,802
...which could buy liquor and women.

252
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:41,206
But there were honest men
who would fight...

253
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,007
Let's get that beer.

254
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:46,844
- Who planted the roots
that would grow into a nation.

255
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,203
Blueridge won't buy it.

256
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,045
I don't build a thing
that'll be a slum in 20 years.

257
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:05,238
And I won't doze those hills.
What I build conforms to the land.

258
00:29:05,489 --> 00:29:09,243
And you can't hear the toilets flush
next door.

259
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:13,004
You want our help,
you'll have to let me work on it.

260
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:16,084
Up to a point, I want your help.

261
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,604
And up to a point, I'll give it.

262
00:30:08,089 --> 00:30:10,808
When do I get a look-see?

263
00:30:11,129 --> 00:30:13,199
In a couple days.

264
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:16,009
Guard said you were here
until after midnight.

265
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:18,001
That's the way I work.

266
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:20,803
Somebody once said,
I forget who...

267
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:25,639
...that he never looked back, because
something might be gaining on him.

268
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,801
What's gaining on you, Paul?

269
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,927
Twenty-million-dollar investment,
what else?

270
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:37,801
I was gonna ask you to dinner but
I don't think you'd be good company.

271
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:39,522
No, I don't think I would.

272
00:30:39,769 --> 00:30:43,728
Might amuse you. Maybe you've
never seen a club like this.

273
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:47,598
It's a gun club. We shoot guns.

274
00:30:50,889 --> 00:30:53,528
So much hoopla
from gun control people...

275
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,681
...half the nation's scared
to hold a gun.

276
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:59,397
Like it was a snake that would bite.

277
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,804
Hell, a gun is just a tool.

278
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:05,328
Like a hammer. Or an axe.

279
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,003
Used to put food on the table.

280
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:12,720
Keep foxes out of the chicken coop,
bandits out of the bank.

281
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:16,086
How long since you held
a pistol in your hand?

282
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,605
A long time.

283
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:23,607
- Which war was yours? Korea?
- Yeah.

284
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:25,720
- See much action?
- A little.

285
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,800
Were you infantry?

286
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:31,479
I was a C.O. In a medical unit.

287
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:34,402
A commanding officer, huh?

288
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:36,799
Conscientious objector.

289
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,288
Oh, Christ.

290
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,999
What a guest to bring to a gun club.

291
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:45,040
You one of them liberals...

292
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:49,601
...thinks we shoot our guns because
it's an extension of our penises.

293
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,518
I never thought about it that way.
It could be true.

294
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:57,922
Maybe it is. But this is gun country.

295
00:31:58,169 --> 00:32:02,799
Can't own a gun in New York.
Here, I hardly know a man who doesn't.

296
00:32:03,009 --> 00:32:09,118
And unlike your city, we can walk
our streets at night and feel safe.

297
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:13,885
Muggers out here, they just plain
get their asses blown up.

298
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:16,438
Here, slip these on.

299
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:19,681
All right.
This is a percussion pistol.

300
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,442
1842.

301
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,603
You ever handled one before?

302
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:30,606
You know how to fire it?

303
00:32:31,129 --> 00:32:35,361
Watch the kick. You'll think
your arm's gonna hit the ceiling.

304
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,598
Goddamn! Paul, you hit dead centre.

305
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:51,921
- Mind if I try this hogleg Colt?
- No.

306
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:55,280
You're a peculiar
conscientious objector.

307
00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:57,804
- These notches for real?
- Yeah.

308
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,002
Belonged to a gunfighter
named Candy Dan in 1890.

309
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:07,721
I do know something about guns.
I grew up with them. All kinds.

310
00:33:07,969 --> 00:33:12,485
My father was a hunter. I guess
out here you call them gunmen.

311
00:33:12,689 --> 00:33:15,965
My mother
was the other side of the coin.

312
00:33:16,409 --> 00:33:19,879
When my father was killed
in a hunting accident...

313
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,597
Some fool mistook him
for a deer, you see.

314
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:27,798
My mother won the toss.
I never touched a gun since.

315
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,601
I loved my father.

316
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:44,205
There are your hills.

317
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:49,087
Every house has a part of one
for a backyard for kids, dogs.

318
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:52,605
400 houses.
100 more than you allowed for.

319
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:55,004
And you still have 12 hills.

320
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:01,764
I'm catching the 10:40 to New York.
What do I tell them?

321
00:34:02,489 --> 00:34:05,401
You tell them
I'll buy it if they will.

322
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:25,527
You checking this bag in?

323
00:34:25,729 --> 00:34:27,242
- Yeah.
- Good.

324
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,482
A little going-away present for you.

325
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,447
Thank you.

326
00:34:41,809 --> 00:34:44,403
Good morning, sir.
How are you today?

327
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:45,718
Checking one bag?

328
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:48,887
I can't thank you enough
for what you did.

329
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:54,117
I want you to know if you ever
get tired of living in that toilet...

330
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,726
...you're welcome here.

331
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,725
- Welcome home.
- Hi, Jack.

332
00:35:07,969 --> 00:35:10,278
I halfway expected to see Carol.

333
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,684
Let's go get your bags.

334
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,282
What is it?

335
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,884
She's in the hospital.

336
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:25,678
When I last spoke to you,
you said she was feeling better.

337
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,685
I didn't see any need to get you
disturbed on a long-distance call.

338
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:38,478
Come on, Dad. Don't do a number.

339
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:40,481
Don't do a number on me.

340
00:35:40,689 --> 00:35:43,078
There was nothing you could do.

341
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,080
They haven't even let me see her
for two days.

342
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,603
They tried insulin shock yesterday.

343
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,079
She's not responding.

344
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:58,007
You want technical jargon?
I can reel it off.

345
00:35:58,249 --> 00:36:03,687
Catatonia, dementia praecox,
passive schizoid paranoia.

346
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:08,362
It boils down to this: She's had
an experience she can't face...

347
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,079
...and she's running away from it
inside herself.

348
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,479
You didn't handle it right.

349
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,643
Oh, Christ, Dad.

350
00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:28,926
I'll get other doctors.
Who are these doctors you have?

351
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:30,966
They're good doctors.

352
00:36:34,169 --> 00:36:36,524
She's almost a goddamn vegetable.

353
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:11,478
If you don't sign the papers,
what happens?

354
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:16,805
They keep her until the insurance
runs out. That won't be long.

355
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:21,281
If you sign the papers
and she's committed, what then?

356
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,808
I've got insurance that covers it
up to $600 a month.

357
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:29,678
They've recommended
a sanatorium in Long Island.

358
00:37:33,129 --> 00:37:36,087
This commitment,
is it a one-way thing?

359
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:39,688
Nobody can answer that, Dad.

360
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,520
You want to know what they are?
Statistics on a police blotter.

361
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:49,079
Mom and Carol, along with
thousands of other people.

362
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,486
And there is nothing we can do
to stop it.

363
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,720
Nothing but cut and run.

364
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:21,484
What a bummer. That was the
worst fucking movie I've ever seen.

365
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:50,280
You got money, man?

366
00:41:54,169 --> 00:41:58,765
I'll kill you. Give me your money
or I'll bust you up.

367
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:41,685
Oh, Jesus.

368
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:24,480
Good morning, inspector.

369
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:27,121
Good morning. What do we got?

370
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,008
We got a corpse.
One bullet hole in his chest.

371
00:43:30,249 --> 00:43:34,288
Fellow over there was jogging,
found him on the path.

372
00:43:34,489 --> 00:43:37,526
- The dead man?
- Thomas Leroy Marston.

373
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:43,287
He had a parole card. Served 42 months
of a 5-year hitch for grand larceny.

374
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:47,198
He's a drug addict,
probably popping smack again.

375
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:52,079
We found this on the grass next to him.
The thing hasn't been fired.

376
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:56,083
Deceased had a gun clip on his belt,
must be his.

377
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:02,124
What would you say if I suggested
he tried a heist and got shot?

378
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:05,088
Maybe two guys
trying to heist each other.

379
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:10,079
No, this man wasn't robbed.
He still has money in his wallet.

380
00:44:34,449 --> 00:44:36,280
- Morning, Paul.
- Morning.

381
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:39,202
- Hi, Paul.
- Morning, Sam.

382
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:43,522
Well, we've marked it out
as you've indicated.

383
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:45,327
It's beautiful.

384
00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:47,525
What's our profit?

385
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,761
Not quite three million, but...

386
00:44:50,929 --> 00:44:55,320
...our investment can be amortised
in two years. It is a show-place.

387
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,525
Look at that wasted space.

388
00:44:57,769 --> 00:45:01,682
Jainchill loves those hills.
Besides, it's take it or leave it.

389
00:45:01,929 --> 00:45:04,363
It's too pretty to leave.

390
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:07,484
Okay, I'll run it for the board.

391
00:45:07,689 --> 00:45:10,681
- I may need your help, Paul.
- Okay.

392
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:14,886
Tucson agreed with you. You look well.

393
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:17,887
I feel good.

394
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:48,518
- Was he a white man or a black man?
- I just don't know.

395
00:46:48,769 --> 00:46:50,725
They were under that light.

396
00:46:50,969 --> 00:46:54,006
I wasn't seeing good,
I had blood in my eyes.

397
00:46:54,249 --> 00:46:58,128
Well, was he tall, short, thin, fat?

398
00:46:58,369 --> 00:47:01,008
Frank, forget it, huh?

399
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:03,888
Ride the ambulance to the morgue.

400
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:06,929
When they get the slugs out...

401
00:47:07,169 --> 00:47:10,286
...run them over to the lab
for ballistics.

402
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:19,483
You saw him pretty good, didn't you?

403
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:23,478
You're full of shit.

404
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:25,284
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

405
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,765
If we had the brains
to live in the country...

406
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,648
...we wouldn't be here
for the reason we are today.

407
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:38,488
We'd be going
into the city to work...

408
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,085
...Mom and Carol would be
safe at home waiting for us.

409
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:45,401
Nothing to do but cut and run.

410
00:48:45,649 --> 00:48:47,207
What else?

411
00:48:47,449 --> 00:48:51,522
What about the old American
social custom of self-defence?

412
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:56,285
If the police don't defend us,
maybe we ought to do it ourselves.

413
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,487
We're not pioneers anymore, Dad.

414
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:03,525
- What are we, Jack?
- What do you mean?

415
00:49:03,769 --> 00:49:07,284
I mean, if we're not pioneers,
what have we become?

416
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,078
What do you call people...

417
00:49:10,289 --> 00:49:13,486
...who, when faced
with a condition of fear...

418
00:49:13,729 --> 00:49:18,086
...do nothing about it?
They just run and hide.

419
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,486
Civilised?

420
00:49:23,849 --> 00:49:25,680
No.

421
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:34,409
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to start
this investigation somewhere.

422
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:36,480
So let's start here.

423
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:45,079
Motive: Revenge.

424
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,320
I want the records checked.

425
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,400
Go back, say...

426
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:51,924
...three months.

427
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,160
Limit it to homicide.

428
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:58,561
We could be looking for a man
who's had a member of his family...

429
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:00,686
...killed by muggers.

430
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:06,282
Now, he shoots that pistol
pretty good, right?

431
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:09,087
Okay.

432
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:10,881
Combat veteran.

433
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:15,998
Put Vietnam vets at the top of the
list because they're young and tough.

434
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:19,525
Then work through
Korea and World War II.

435
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:22,283
Oh, my God.

436
00:50:23,009 --> 00:50:24,681
Who said that?

437
00:50:26,449 --> 00:50:29,600
Whoever said it,
you're right on the button.

438
00:50:29,849 --> 00:50:34,479
By God and Jesus Christ,
it's impossible.

439
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:39,803
But until we find a shortcut,
we at least keep busy.

440
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:43,678
So when the media demands to know
what we are doing...

441
00:50:43,929 --> 00:50:48,047
...we'll tell them
we have definite clues.

442
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,687
Okay?

443
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:54,684
We won't tell them we have
1000 definite clues.

444
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:49,283
Did anybody see what he looked like?

445
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:54,478
We're in Commissioner Dryer's office
waiting for a press conference.

446
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:59,007
Last night, there was another killing
which appears to be the work...

447
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:02,884
...of the person the media has dubbed
"the vigilante."

448
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:19,362
This is the first official statement
from the commissioner.

449
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:21,679
I can see the commissioner now...

450
00:54:21,889 --> 00:54:26,440
Good morning.
With me is Inspector Frank Ochoa...

451
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:30,879
...who's been placed in command
of a police detail...

452
00:54:31,129 --> 00:54:35,008
...assigned to what we've all
been calling the "vigilante murders."

453
00:54:35,209 --> 00:54:39,999
Now, it has been confirmed
by our ballistics laboratory...

454
00:54:40,249 --> 00:54:45,767
...that the same gun, a.32 pistol,
used in the previous homicides...

455
00:54:46,009 --> 00:54:50,287
...was used last night in a shooting
aboard a subway train.

456
00:54:50,529 --> 00:54:54,522
Now, I know that this person
has captured the imagination...

457
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:59,923
...of many people in our city.
And I want to say to our citizens...

458
00:55:00,169 --> 00:55:03,206
...murder is no answer
to crime in a city.

459
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:07,522
Crime is a police responsibility.

460
00:55:07,769 --> 00:55:11,318
And if this person
is listening to my voice...

461
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:14,322
...I urge him in the name
of law and order...

462
00:55:14,569 --> 00:55:18,323
...to desist
from this one-man crusade...

463
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:23,689
...and turn himself in to the police.
He'll be given fair treatment.

464
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:27,808
That's our police commissioner,
the king of clichés.

465
00:55:28,009 --> 00:55:30,921
- Vigilante’s identification?
- No comment.

466
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:33,878
Do you think he's crazy?

467
00:55:34,089 --> 00:55:39,288
He's got a wire down, all right,
but I don't believe he's a maniac.

468
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:44,802
It's rumoured the rate of muggings
has dropped. Is that true?

469
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:46,198
Not true.

470
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:48,804
If it were, would you announce it?

471
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:51,279
Or are you afraid of imitators?

472
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:54,720
I don't want to get
into these hypothetical questions.

473
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:57,563
I'll bet muggings are down.

474
00:55:57,809 --> 00:56:01,279
One way to find out.
Take a walk on Columbus Avenue.

475
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:04,686
I think I'll wait
for the official report.

476
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:13,684
Yes?

477
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:18,087
You want to confess
to the vigilante killings.

478
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:21,679
All right, I'll put you
through to Rosenberg.

479
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:25,086
He's in charge
of confessions today.

480
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:28,480
He's the 23rd. Put him through.

481
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:31,727
We couldn't get prints
off the groceries.

482
00:56:31,969 --> 00:56:35,678
- Wasn't there a sales slip?
- Yeah. Here.

483
00:56:37,249 --> 00:56:40,002
D'Agostino's.

484
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:46,718
Some of this code must identify
the particular store.

485
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,527
Find out where it is.

486
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:53,843
Get records and check on families
that have somebody killed by muggers.

487
00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:58,799
Put them through the computer
and see if any live near this store.

488
00:56:59,009 --> 00:57:03,002
People are inclined to buy groceries
in their own neighbourhoods.

489
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:06,723
Hi, Jack. Come on in.

490
00:57:06,929 --> 00:57:09,124
Make yourself a drink.

491
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:14,119
What do you think? The new paint.

492
00:57:15,129 --> 00:57:20,123
- It's a little hard on the eyes...
- On the eyes? It's cheerful.

493
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:26,845
Turn it up, I can't hear.

494
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:34,525
We got liver and spaghetti for dinner.
How do you like your liver?

495
00:57:34,729 --> 00:57:37,926
Hey, no drink? Let me make you one.

496
00:57:38,529 --> 00:57:41,726
Listen, that's all right.
I'll get it myself.

497
00:57:45,049 --> 00:57:46,801
I saw Carol today.

498
00:57:47,249 --> 00:57:52,243
- Aren't you gonna ask how she's doing?
- I went up to see her yesterday.

499
00:57:53,089 --> 00:57:55,000
What are you so high about?

500
00:57:55,249 --> 00:57:59,128
You want me to moan and groan
for the rest of my life?

501
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,680
You want your liver medium?

502
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:07,242
Medium. I'll make it medium.

503
00:58:21,689 --> 00:58:24,328
Hey, there goes the pussy posse.

504
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:52,523
Hey, mister, you got a match?

505
00:59:55,169 --> 00:59:56,522
Yeah.

506
00:59:56,729 --> 00:59:58,924
What else you got?

507
01:00:01,489 --> 01:00:03,719
Let's see the money, man.

508
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:05,926
You'll have to take it.

509
01:00:43,929 --> 01:00:45,726
He went that way.

510
01:02:05,609 --> 01:02:08,043
Who rode in the ambulance with them?

511
01:02:08,249 --> 01:02:09,523
I did.

512
01:02:10,169 --> 01:02:12,603
Well, was he talking?

513
01:02:12,849 --> 01:02:15,204
He said he cut whoever shot him.

514
01:02:15,449 --> 01:02:19,124
Exact words: " I cut that motherfucker,
I hit him."

515
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:22,921
Can't save him.
Too much internal bleeding.

516
01:02:23,169 --> 01:02:25,842
One slug chewed up the liver. Here.

517
01:02:30,969 --> 01:02:32,038
Thirty-twos.

518
01:02:33,609 --> 01:02:37,522
The mysterious vigilante
is in the news again.

519
01:02:37,769 --> 01:02:42,206
Two hours ago in a subway underpass
two men were shot.

520
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:46,522
One died on the spot,
the other managed to reach the street.

521
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,606
He died shortly afterward.

522
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:52,998
The two men are Joseph
Roscoe Adams and George Riche.

523
01:02:53,209 --> 01:02:55,564
Both had long criminal records.

524
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:59,722
The vigilante himself
may have been wounded.

525
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:03,524
The actions of a vigilante,
lawless as they may be...

526
01:03:03,769 --> 01:03:08,001
...seem to be giving others
a new attitude toward crime.

527
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:13,164
Instead of allowing themselves
to be mugged, a few are fighting back.

528
01:03:13,409 --> 01:03:17,402
Mrs. Alma Lee Brown
today successfully defended herself...

529
01:03:17,649 --> 01:03:20,721
...against two muggers
with an unusual weapon.

530
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:25,406
- Tell us, how did you drive them off?
- With a hatpin.

531
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:31,047
- You ever seen a hatpin?
- I can't say that I have.

532
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:34,838
That's what we used to use
to hold our hats on with.

533
01:03:35,089 --> 01:03:38,843
I ain't got no gun
like this vigilante fellow.

534
01:03:39,169 --> 01:03:44,289
But I went to my closet,
and everybody better look out for me.

535
01:03:45,009 --> 01:03:49,127
Because I been robbed
too many times. And I've had enough.

536
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:53,800
The men building this skyscraper
made a citizen's arrest today.

537
01:03:54,049 --> 01:03:56,847
Andrew McCabe, a foreman,
will tell you.

538
01:03:57,289 --> 01:04:00,326
Me and my crew was working
down in the hole.

539
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:05,404
One of the boys yelled down, "There's
a mugging. " So we come out...

540
01:04:05,649 --> 01:04:11,724
...and we caught this guy and
roughed him up before the police came.

541
01:04:11,929 --> 01:04:16,207
The hospital reports the man
had broken arms and cracked ribs.

542
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:20,601
No kidding? Jeez, the poor guy
must have fell down.

543
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:23,761
Walking distance from D'Agostino's...

544
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:27,524
...two blocks across,
six blocks uptown and downtown.

545
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:31,125
That's how far I'd be willing
to walk to a market.

546
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:34,127
Good. Very good, Miss Chamitti.

547
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:39,159
12 families within this area suffered
a death in the past three months...

548
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:42,367
...from mugging, stabbing,
shooting, assault.

549
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:44,918
Two families have no male members.

550
01:04:45,129 --> 01:04:47,768
One has only
an 80-year-old grandfather.

551
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:49,920
That leaves nine families.

552
01:04:50,169 --> 01:04:53,127
Total number of males
in these families...

553
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:57,720
...old enough to have served in
Vietnam, Korea or World War II.

554
01:04:57,929 --> 01:05:00,124
...comes to 14.

555
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:05,125
Wild. It's a real wild shot.

556
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:09,920
But the vigilante plugged
his first victim in Riverside Park.

557
01:05:10,169 --> 01:05:14,845
Exactly two and one half blocks
from that D'Agostino's Market.

558
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:19,446
Even if all of them are clean,
we can't ignore that coincidence.

559
01:05:19,689 --> 01:05:23,125
No, sir.
Our friend lives in that neighbourhood.

560
01:05:23,329 --> 01:05:28,244
But, Frank, he was on a subway
with groceries five miles uptown.

561
01:05:28,449 --> 01:05:32,362
There's no better come-on
for a mugging than groceries.

562
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:36,204
Means he's got some money
and his hands are occupied.

563
01:05:36,449 --> 01:05:40,328
He might have been carrying
those groceries for hours.

564
01:05:41,329 --> 01:05:45,117
I want a preliminary on these names.
Where they work...

565
01:05:45,369 --> 01:05:47,837
...service record, reputation...

566
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:50,125
...police record, if any.

567
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:53,725
And I want it fast.

568
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:57,518
Like today, huh?

569
01:05:58,409 --> 01:06:03,324
It's probably having as much effect
on crime as a Band-Aid on a leper.

570
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:07,448
I don't know. A mugger will
think twice about who he hits.

571
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:10,044
Sure, they hit more old ladies.

572
01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:13,326
Paul, how you doing?
Let me get you a drink.

573
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:17,167
The guy's a racist.

574
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:21,322
- He kills more blacks than whites.
- More blacks are muggers.

575
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:26,398
You want to up the proportion of white
muggers to have racial equality?

576
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:30,522
What? Racial equality among muggers?
I love it.

577
01:07:05,729 --> 01:07:10,120
- What have you got here?
- Guy named Paul Kersey.

578
01:07:10,369 --> 01:07:14,328
Wife was murdered in their apartment.
Interesting detail:

579
01:07:14,529 --> 01:07:17,760
The attackers
gained entrance to the apartment...

580
01:07:18,009 --> 01:07:21,797
...posing as delivery boys
from our D'Agostino's Market.

581
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:24,847
- What else about him?
- He lives alone now.

582
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:28,001
Development engineer for Blueridge.

583
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:30,717
Served in Korea, medical corps.

584
01:07:30,929 --> 01:07:32,920
Conscientious objector.

585
01:07:33,129 --> 01:07:37,088
No police record.
His credits, reputation, excellent.

586
01:07:37,289 --> 01:07:40,440
Conscientious objectors
are unlikely vigilantes.

587
01:07:41,129 --> 01:07:42,721
- We got a finger?
- Yeah.

588
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:47,327
Over there. Patrolman Joe Charles.

589
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:48,638
Good.

590
01:07:52,529 --> 01:07:53,882
Good morning.

591
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:57,521
- Joe Charles, Mr. Kersey.
- Of course.

592
01:07:57,769 --> 01:07:59,805
Good to see you again.

593
01:08:00,049 --> 01:08:01,767
How's your daughter?

594
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,523
The same.

595
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:05,722
Take care.

596
01:08:08,609 --> 01:08:10,122
Follow him.

597
01:08:22,329 --> 01:08:24,718
I'll see to that, Mrs. Cohen.

598
01:08:27,129 --> 01:08:29,404
One moment. You're not residents.

599
01:08:29,609 --> 01:08:33,124
- I'll call who you wish to see.
- No, you won't.

600
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:15,328
The district attorney
will see you now.

601
01:10:24,129 --> 01:10:27,519
- Commissioner.
- You know the district attorney.

602
01:10:27,729 --> 01:10:30,721
- Mr. Peters.
- Inspector.

603
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:34,527
Commissioner says you have
a good suspect.

604
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:38,318
Well, he fits the bill
in some respects.

605
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:43,006
We got a blood sample from the
knife used on him in the subway...

606
01:10:43,249 --> 01:10:47,162
...and checked it against the sample
I found in his apartment.

607
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,808
It narrows it down.

608
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:50,846
But he could be the man.

609
01:10:51,089 --> 01:10:55,128
Yeah. Yeah, he could be.

610
01:10:57,809 --> 01:11:01,358
Suppose this Paul Kersey
is the vigilante.

611
01:11:01,609 --> 01:11:03,565
All right, let's say that.

612
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:08,519
We don't want him.

613
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:10,598
Okay.

614
01:11:11,209 --> 01:11:16,727
Inspector, on my desk I have a
statistic red-hot out of the computer.

615
01:11:16,929 --> 01:11:20,365
Mugging has gone down
by how much, sir?

616
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,204
From 950 a week
to 470 reported last week.

617
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:26,917
Not too many people know that.

618
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:33,005
- And you want to keep it that way.
- No, we have to keep it that way.

619
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:34,927
This city would explode.

620
01:11:35,129 --> 01:11:40,123
We'd have vigilantes killing anybody
who looked greasy. You can see that.

621
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:43,241
We want this man to quit, desist...

622
01:11:43,489 --> 01:11:47,243
...go away. To stop.

623
01:11:49,089 --> 01:11:51,319
So the mugging rate can go up?

624
01:11:52,569 --> 01:11:54,366
Why not arrest him?

625
01:11:54,609 --> 01:12:00,718
- I don't want a martyr on my hands.
- All right. All right.

626
01:12:00,969 --> 01:12:03,529
I just want to hear you say it.

627
01:12:08,889 --> 01:12:10,641
I'll try to scare him off.

628
01:12:11,289 --> 01:12:13,325
But that's as far as I'll go.

629
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:16,766
That's right, Frank. Scare him off.

630
01:12:18,449 --> 01:12:20,519
Scare him off.

631
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:39,199
A call from an old friend, who
wonders if you'll recognise his voice.

632
01:12:39,449 --> 01:12:42,441
Do you want it,
or shall I insist upon his name?

633
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:46,119
- Okay, I'll take it.
- I'm putting you through.

634
01:12:47,769 --> 01:12:48,758
Hello?

635
01:12:49,009 --> 01:12:50,761
Is this Paul Kersey?

636
01:12:50,969 --> 01:12:52,561
Yes, who's this?

637
01:12:54,129 --> 01:12:57,360
Mr. Kersey, you're under
police surveillance.

638
01:12:57,729 --> 01:12:59,924
You're being watched.

639
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:09,919
Scare him off.

640
01:13:22,009 --> 01:13:25,001
Paper, papers!

641
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:28,400
Read all about the vigilante!

642
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:30,526
Get your papers here!

643
01:13:30,729 --> 01:13:32,720
Read all about the vigilante!

644
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:34,726
How are you this evening?

645
01:13:34,929 --> 01:13:37,523
Paper, papers!

646
01:13:37,729 --> 01:13:40,766
Read all about the vigilante!

647
01:13:55,929 --> 01:13:59,558
All right, get your hands up.
Hands on the car.

648
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:01,322
Spread your legs.

649
01:14:09,169 --> 01:14:10,727
Okay, turn around.

650
01:14:11,249 --> 01:14:13,524
Let's see some identification.

651
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:21,607
- Where do you live?
- Thirty-three Riverside.

652
01:14:21,849 --> 01:14:26,525
Sorry to rough you up. We're looking
for a guy by your description.

653
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:29,527
He's armed,
so we couldn't take chances.

654
01:14:29,729 --> 01:14:31,367
I hope you understand.

655
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:36,360
- Lf you want to make a complaint...
- It's all right, nobody was hurt.

656
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:38,725
Thanks. Good night.

657
01:14:45,249 --> 01:14:46,762
Okay?

658
01:14:47,009 --> 01:14:50,365
Yeah. Okay.

659
01:15:09,929 --> 01:15:14,719
Went in the building 10 minutes ago.
Went to D'Agostino's first.

660
01:16:12,009 --> 01:16:13,727
Let's check him, huh?

661
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:16,923
Go to that phone and call him.

662
01:16:17,129 --> 01:16:20,724
- He's up there.
- Check him anyway.

663
01:17:31,809 --> 01:17:34,960
Police! I need the phone. Come on.

664
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:36,688
Who is this guy?

665
01:17:36,889 --> 01:17:39,642
He said, "Police."
I didn't see a badge.

666
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:47,918
I'll call as soon as he gets off.

667
01:17:48,129 --> 01:17:49,118
Thanks.

668
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:51,325
Yeah, up yours.

669
01:17:57,569 --> 01:18:00,037
No answer. He could be in the shower.

670
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:02,120
Stay here.

671
01:18:55,609 --> 01:18:58,123
- Good night, Mr. Kersey.
- Good night.

672
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:27,520
Has Paul Kersey gone up?

673
01:19:27,769 --> 01:19:31,557
Yes, sir. He went up and came down.
Just walked out.

674
01:20:00,809 --> 01:20:03,562
- Where'd you go?
- Did he show here?

675
01:20:03,809 --> 01:20:07,927
Can I ask a simple question?
Is this Paul Kersey the bird?

676
01:20:09,009 --> 01:20:11,125
I won't ask any more questions.

677
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:14,924
- Go home, will you? I don't need you.
- Weird.

678
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:47,198
Come on down, motherfucker.
We gonna take you.

679
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:51,527
That's right, motherfucker.
And you can't go back up either.

680
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:01,568
Come down
and bring us the money, honey.

681
01:21:01,809 --> 01:21:05,324
How much money you got, honey?

682
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:14,401
What the fuck?

683
01:21:47,009 --> 01:21:53,118
- Units at the 26 Precinct. A 1034.
125 Street on the West Side highway.

684
01:23:11,729 --> 01:23:13,048
Fill your hand.

685
01:23:18,729 --> 01:23:20,321
Draw.

686
01:23:30,169 --> 01:23:32,888
All right, get back!

687
01:24:00,969 --> 01:24:02,641
Where's this patrolman?

688
01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:19,324
- You're Reilly?
- Yes.

689
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:21,724
- I'm Ochoa.
- Yes, sir.

690
01:24:23,369 --> 01:24:26,406
- You were the first on the scene?
- Yes.

691
01:24:26,649 --> 01:24:27,923
God bless you, sir.

692
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:33,841
Never mind that. They told me
on the radio you had to see me.

693
01:24:34,089 --> 01:24:35,522
Paul Kersey.

694
01:24:36,489 --> 01:24:40,118
- You spoke to him before the ambulance?
- No, sir.

695
01:24:40,329 --> 01:24:42,445
- What did you get?
- His address.

696
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,727
Is that all?

697
01:24:47,769 --> 01:24:48,838
Well?

698
01:24:57,929 --> 01:25:01,205
- You enter this on your report?
- Not yet, sir.

699
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:04,278
Why not?

700
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:08,485
I was waiting for instructions, sir.

701
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:10,088
You never saw it.

702
01:25:11,809 --> 01:25:13,527
Yes, sir.

703
01:25:16,209 --> 01:25:19,007
Oh, what's your full name?

704
01:25:19,209 --> 01:25:21,803
Jackson Reilly, sir. 21st Precinct.

705
01:25:22,729 --> 01:25:26,119
Okay. I'll remember it.

706
01:25:37,889 --> 01:25:40,403
- Do you have the vigilante?
- No.

707
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:42,839
Well, who have you got there?

708
01:25:47,209 --> 01:25:51,122
You in charge? How is he?
Wounds are clean, nothing vital.

709
01:25:51,329 --> 01:25:54,924
Soon as we get some blood in him,
we'll sew him up.

710
01:25:55,169 --> 01:25:58,525
- All right if I go in?
- He won't be able to talk.

711
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:01,527
- Can he hear me?
- He is conscious.

712
01:26:11,849 --> 01:26:14,602
Police. I'd like to have him alone.

713
01:26:29,089 --> 01:26:30,920
Good evening, Mr. Kersey.

714
01:26:37,129 --> 01:26:39,006
This is your gun.

715
01:26:40,609 --> 01:26:44,807
We gave you a chance to get rid of it.
You wouldn't take it.

716
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:48,324
Do you hear me okay?

717
01:26:49,489 --> 01:26:53,164
We have here a peculiar situation,
Mr. Kersey.

718
01:26:53,409 --> 01:26:58,961
It's necessary to make a proposition
since you won't favour us by dying.

719
01:26:59,769 --> 01:27:04,320
You work for a company
with lots of offices.

720
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:07,641
Get a transfer to another city...

721
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,120
...and I'll drop this gun
in the river.

722
01:27:14,009 --> 01:27:18,321
Are we connecting, Mr. Kersey?

723
01:27:19,929 --> 01:27:24,923
We want you to get out of New York.
Permanently.

724
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:31,322
Inspector...

725
01:27:35,009 --> 01:27:37,443
...by sundown?

726
01:27:52,009 --> 01:27:53,328
There he is.

727
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:54,962
Do you have the vigilante?

728
01:27:55,209 --> 01:27:57,723
- Like to give us some information?
- No.

729
01:27:57,929 --> 01:28:01,205
- Is the wounded man the vigilante?
- He's just a mugging victim.

730
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:06,244
- What about reports that he is?
- False reports.

731
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:10,528
- Then he's still out there.
- That's right.

732
01:28:10,729 --> 01:28:13,880
Was he shot by the vigilante?

733
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:32,639
Mr. Kersey.
Fred Brown. Welcome to Chicago.

734
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:34,959
- Nice trip?
- It was okay.

735
01:28:35,169 --> 01:28:38,923
I found a nice apartment for you
on Lakeshore Drive...

736
01:28:39,129 --> 01:28:42,485
...a view of Lake Michigan.
Your office is ready too.

737
01:28:42,689 --> 01:28:45,157
There's a good golf club we can play.

738
01:28:45,409 --> 01:28:48,048
- I think you'll enjoy it here.
- Excuse me.

739
01:29:31,489 --> 01:29:32,478

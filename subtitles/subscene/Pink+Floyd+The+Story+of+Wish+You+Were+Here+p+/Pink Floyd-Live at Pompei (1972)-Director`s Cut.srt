Could l have egg, sausage,

22
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,277
- Nick?
- What?

23
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,154
- Shall l tell you one thing?
- Tell us one thing, Rog.

24
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,990
- This is nothing like our supper usually is.
- This is true.

25
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,272
Usually we're chatting away,
enjoying ourselves. That's a fact.

26
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,270
Could l have a glass of milk, please?

27
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,594
- What?
- No.

28
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,679
- Why not?
- Whose is that?

29
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,712
- How do you know this isn't yours?
- It hasn't got peas.

30
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,389
Well, this has got ham on it.

31
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,239
That's what you ordered.
You ordered tomatoes.

32
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:34,037
- Is this your milk? Can l drink it?
- No. You can have a sip.

33
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,789
- Thanks, man.
- When's the shop opening?

34
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,437
I don't think equipment could take over.
We rely on it a lot.

35
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,758
We couldn't do what we do,
as we do it, without it.

36
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:07,273
We could still do a good,
entertaining musical show without it.

37
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,358
Those things are down
to how you control them,

38
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,632
whether you're controlling them,
not the other way round.

39
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,038
It's a question of using the tools available
when they're available.

40
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,315
There's all kinds of electronic goodies
available for people like us to use.

41
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,956
Ifwe can be bothered.
And we can be bothered.

42
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,992
It's all extensions ofwhat's coming out
of our heads.

43
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,155
You've got to have it inside your head
to be able to get it out at all.

44
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,400
The equipment isn't thinking ofwhat to do
any ofthe time.

45
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,639
It couldn't control itself.

46
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,879
Can l put this down?

47
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,389
It's just on... the first note.

48
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,798
- Hang on. Say that again.
- Can l put this down?

49
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,388
I've still got to try
and put on the other track.

50
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,875
Stay cool.

51
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,433
Turn the volume down.

52
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,788
It would be interesting to see what four
people could do, if given the equipment,

53
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,795
who didn't know anything about it,
and told to get on with it and do something.

54
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,637
I think we'd come off better.

55
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,150
It's like saying, give a man a Les Paul
guitar and he becomes Eric Clapton.

56
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,238
You know? And it's not true.

57
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,673
Give a man an amplifier and a synthesizer
and he doesn't become whoever.

58
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,074
He doesn't become us.

59
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,637
- Come and hear it.
- I will.

What's this film you've been working on?

63
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,113
You should know. You're the director.

64
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,277
- Rock and roll.
- It's rock and roll?

65
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,590
- Oops!
- Tell us about it.

66
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,958
- Pull yourselftogether, David.
- I can't.

67
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:30,757
Oh, dear! God! lt's a film
being made in Pompei, mostly, in ltaly.

68
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,599
- About?
- It's about the Pink Floyd.

69
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,712
Are you fairly happy about the film?

70
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,119
- What do you mean "happy"?
- Do you feel it's going in a direction

71
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,439
- which is interesting? Or not?
- What do you mean "interesting"?

72
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,836
Hello, Mum! Hello, Dad!

EUROPASONOR MIXING STUDIO

74
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,393
It's just the oysters are good, ain't they?
Good oysters here, aren't there?

75
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,958
It's good oysters here.
Seems to be the right season ofyear.

76
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,753
- The oysters are all right.
- They're very good.

77
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,031
- Yes, this time ofyear.
- Were they French?

78
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,550
I don't know what nationality they are.

79
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,071
I like to think oysters
transcend national barriers.

80
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,829
We could become slaves
of all our equipment.

81
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,192
In the past, we have.
But we're trying to sort it all out.

82
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,270
So that we're not. But l agree.
I mean, it worries me sometimes.

83
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,554
That we have this much equipment.
And you can hide behind it.

84
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,754
If l heard somebody saying that,
l'd like to say, ifwe were at a gig,

85
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,634
it would be nice sometimes to say,
"Go on then, there it is."

86
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,911
"Get stuck in.
You can open the show."

87
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,273
"There's going to be 4,000 people
in here in half an hour."

88
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,029
"Get up there and knock them out, man!"
And they'd say,

89
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,914
"But we don't know the equipment
and need time to rehearse."

90
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,318
So we'd say, "So did we.
About four or five years."

91
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,194
To some extent we're trying
to simplify it now,

92
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,838
make the logistics of it
a little more organised.

93
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,190
It's been a bit Heath Robinson,

94
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:41,309
a bit "mad scientist's laboratory"
on the stage.

95
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,511
Would you say you've made a lot of
money working with the Floyd?

96
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,713
Depends who you compare it to, really.

97
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,072
- Say, before working with them, yourself?
- Oh, yeah.

98
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,078
Before working with them, l was...

99
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,034
on a very paltry amount of earnings.

100
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,232
I mean breadline. Breadline and less.

101
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:52,310
When the great economic collapse
happens, it'll happen across the board.

102
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,229
I don't think rock and roll will go first.

103
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,399
The market now in rock and roll
is expanding at a phenomenal rate.

104
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,719
People are constantly saying rock's dying.

105
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,999
Every six months somebody says it,
with enormous conviction.

106
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,553
It's not going to happen.

107
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,990
Unfortunately, really we mark a sort of era.

108
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,912
We're in danger
of becoming a relic ofthe past.

109
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,436
For some people, we represent
their childhood of 1967,

110
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,916
the underground in London,
or the free concert in Hyde Park.

111
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,116
Can you get me a milk, please?

112
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,190
Could you get me a fruit pie and cream?
And not a corner piece.

113
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,754
I'd like some tea...

114
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,908
- And not the crust.
- I don't care what bit l get.

115
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,712
One without a crust.

116
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,709
Ooh, l like a bit of crust!

117
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,796
Rick, are you doing a run down
from D to the B,

118
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,276
before the singing starts
in the middle eight?

119
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:34,070
Aren't you doing that one?
Yes... That's the one!

120
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,634
Sure you don't want this one? Why,
because it's got ice cream on it?

121
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,073
- Steve's got one.
- So boring, man!

122
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,278
Christopher, do something for me?
Could you get another apple pie?

123
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,995
- With ice cream and no crust.
- Can l have an apple pie without a crust?

124
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,157
Just the middle piece.
Have you got any middle pieces?

125
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,354
Pardon?...
Only got the round apple pies now?

126
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,278
- What do you want to do?
- Go on.

127
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,710
- The flames of St Joseph Lockwood.
- Do you want one?

128
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,389
- No, thank you, Christopher.
- Tea?

129
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,431
Tea.

130
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,872
All that media stuff is all very irrelevant.

131
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,391
If people come to a concert
and don't like it, they don't come again.

132
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,433
It's an image we'd like to dispel, l think.

133
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,111
It was very heavy a few years ago,
but it's not so bad since.

134
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,950
I still think most people think of us
as a very drug-orientated group.

135
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,357
Of course we're not. You can trust us.

136
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,599
Are you trying to shake this image off?

137
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,472
Well, we're not exactly...

138
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:10,156
It's not that we're trying to shake
an image off. We're doing other things.

139
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,954
Because we want to do other things.

Adrian, this has got to stop. This attempt
to elicit conversation out ofthe chaps

150
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:14,392
is doomed to failure.
They know you're trying to get them to talk.

Then you're fucking thick!
lfyou'll pardon my French.

- Rock on!
- Quite.

159
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:53,710
Because we've been together such a long
time, we've passed peaks of disagreement,

160
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,231
and worked out methods of living
with each other, and getting on.

161
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:04,310
We're happy together.
We don't... work and that's it.

162
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,276
We're not held together
simply by the bond of success, or money.

163
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,109
- He's not very important.
- Don't waste any film on him.

164
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:27,990
- What's the French for he is only a roadie?
- Say, "Hello, Mum."

165
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,029
- Aren't there any problems or strains?
- Of course there are.

166
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,392
- How do you get round them?
- Pretend they're not there.

167
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,752
We certainly don't face up to them
in an adult way, ifthat's what you mean.

168
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:51,790
- A sense of humour.
- We live miles apart.

169
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,718
You've been going together a long time.

170
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:59,675
- We haven't been "going together"!
- Steady!

171
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,873
- We work together, occasionally...
- We have a great understanding.

172
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,869
- ..whenever we run out of money.
- And tolerance.

173
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,949
So l suppose it's a question of money?

174
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,519
That's all it is, Adrian.

175
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,633
You're being very provocative.
Or trying to be.

176
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,878
- I do my best.
- Well, we refuse to rise.

177
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,151
Quite. Certainly not to a jibe like that.

178
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,831
We understand each other very well.
We're very tolerant.

179
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,557
But there are a lot ofthings unsaid, 
as well. I feel. Sometimes.

180
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:44,630
- How do you get over the difficult times?
- They're not that difficult.

181
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,038
I don't know how we get over it, but we do.

182
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,755
We're all from the British aristocracy,
except David Gilmour.

183
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:55,998
- All our mothers are countesses...
- And dukes and duchesses.

184
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:00,671
My mother was nouveau riche
and bought all the equipment.

185
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,351
When Syd left the group,
we went to David's mother and said,

186
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,871
"We'd like your son to join us.
You'll have to front a lot of equipment."

187
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,870
And that's how we got all our equipment.
It is very easy. It's just a matter of...

188
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,028
- So anybody can do it?
- They have to have a great deal of money.

189
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,438
- You don't need anything else.
- No talent, no musical ability.

190
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,869
No musical training required.

191
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,515
That's what they said to Berlioz.
And he got all those singers together.

192
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,710
That's what they said to Beethoven.
He only carried on because he was deaf.

193
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:16,710
- Yeah, right. Berlioz is...
- He thought, "l'll get an echo chamber..."

194
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:22,073
"A thousand musicians and put them all
in a big church. And a thousand singers."

195
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:28,150
- It's got to sound good.
- Do you think you need any talent at all?

196
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,313
Why are you laughing?

197
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:37,309
Why aren't there millions
of imitators of our sound?

198
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,389
- Why isn't everyone else as successful?
- Don't tell me they can't afford an amp...

199
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,114
- They haven't the money.
- Rubbish!

200
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,915
We only started
with ten bob's worth of gear.

201
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,837
- Have you altered your tone controls?
- No.

202
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,670
- You altered your volume controls?
- I don't think so. What's different?

203
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:45,750
- Didn't sound quite as toppy.
- It didn't sound quite as toppy?

204
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,757
It must have been as toppy. The only thing
it could have been is less toppy.

205
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,871
More toppy, rather.

206
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,752
All right, we all know
that you're God Almighty, Roger.

207
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,351
Steve, you're good at yourjob,
but you could never produce a record.

208
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,711
- It's silly ofyou to try.
- No, rubbish!

209
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:14,072
Ifyou take a crappy enough group
with only twelve songs...

210
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,273
You're talking about producing works of art
or Pink Floyd records.

211
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,598
That's 0.01 per cent ofthe market.
There's plenty of other crap going on.

212
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,793
No, we're not talking about that.
We're talking about a record producer

213
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,674
as somebody who's in charge
of a recording session.

214
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,237
In order to be in charge ofthat,
you need to have a minimal...

215
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,751
Well, not minimal, you need
an extensive knowledge ofthe equipment

216
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,269
and what rock and roll's about.

217
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,473
Steve knows rock and roll,
he's got no idea about the equipment,

218
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:52,550
he's got very little idea, in terms of
technicalities, what the music's about.

219
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,795
He knows what he likes.

220
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,630
Plenty of people have produced records
on that basis, very successful records.

221
00:59:58,760 --> 00:59:59,636
Who?

222
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,198
In the finished article, the only thing that's
important is whether it moves you or not.

223
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:22,394
I can't get over the sibilance ofthe vocals
on Obscured By Clouds. I never play it.

224
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,876
- You're obviously in the wrong business.
- That was a bad cut.

225
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,470
That's nothing to do
with the production ofthe album.

226
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,636
If you listen to the second 
string of pressings,

227
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,593
you'll find
the sibilance isn't there.

228
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,670
Ifyou can still hear a sibilance on those,
you've got a very overactive imagination.

229
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,078
- Because there isn't any.
- We have pretty good arguments, yes.

230
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:51,158
- You manage to get over them?
- Yes, we're pretty durable.

231
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:57,590
We do have infighting, but you mean
without actually exploding?

232
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:08,470
We share the same sense of humour,
to some extent. We lust after money.

233
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:13,830
And we have a lot of interest
in what we're doing together.

234
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,636
We can still combine our interests.
That's when the thing breaks down,

235
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:24,710
when maybe just one person
finds that what he's doing

236
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,958
doesn't interest him, or he feels
he could do something better by himself.

237
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:40,634
We did have some very difficult times,
like a few years ago,

238
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,710
but we've managed to avoid the things
that really get people too touchy.

239
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,317
These days.

240
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,514
- The worst things go unsaid?
- Yeah.

241
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:59,350
- You mentioned money as a main drive?
- Onlyjovially.

242
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:04,395
Naturally, four less money-minded people
would be hard to find.

243
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,279
- Feedback.
- Don't worry about that.

244
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,953
Christ! What would rock and roll be
without feedback?

245
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,835
- Can we run back and drop in?
- Yeah. Just turn it down a bit.

246
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,589
- I didn't really make a specific mistake.
- Turn it down?

247
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:56,474
- My guitar's too loud.
- Can you hear the other one?

248
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,191
No.

249
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,239
25. We're go.

250
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,832
- Altitude 1 ,600.
- Eagle looking great.

251
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,836
Rocket 1202, we copy it.

252
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:14,399
35 degrees. 750. Stand by...

253
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,829
4% down, 5% down...

254
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,628
100 feet, 3% down. 9 forward.

255
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:25,070
OK, 75 feet. Looking good, down a half.

256
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,269
6 forward. 60 seconds.

257
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,911
Lights on. Forward. Forward.

258
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:36,511
20 feet down. 2%.
Picking up some dust...

259
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:39,509
4 forward,
drifting to the right a little.

260
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:40,914
30 seconds.

261
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,636
Contact light? OK, engine stop.

262
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,272

Do you think you're going round in circles?

287
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,797
We don't feel as though we are,
but it's always possible.

288
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:55,391
We may suddenly, like the man in a desert,
come across our footsteps,

289
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,432
and think, "My God, it's all a mistake."

290
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,712
But that's not the way
we feel about it, at all.

291
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,231
I think that's jolly unfair.
I think we're ever so progressive.

292
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,193
We evolve a lot between every record.

293
01:15:10,320 --> 01:15:16,270
We have a recognisable... Anyone who
listens to our songs, knows it's the Floyd.

294
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,679
Anyone listening to many other bands will
know they're playing blues, or this or that.

295
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,155
They can say anything
they want, can't they?

296
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:29,519
- Yes, but do you think they're right?
- Of course l don't.

297
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:35,317
Who are they to say whether anything is
enough, or not enough, about anything?

298
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,591
- Particularly about our records.
- They buy the records.

299
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:43,475
Well, they can listen to it and decide
if it's evolved enough for them to buy it.

300
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,477
If it hasn't,
they don't have to buy it.

301
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,478
Two, three, four.

302
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:00,919
Two, three, four.

303
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,591
Three, four.

304
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:14,590
What did l pop on? Albatross?
Upon the air?

305
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:52,830
- I went out in one place, didn't l?
- We'll listen to it. We'll just check it out.

306
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,796
I think the good times are passing by.

307
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,233
They're carrying on and they will continue
to carry on, l suspect.

308
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:08,990

1
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:44,316
Dark Side of the Moon
was an expression

2
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,446
of political, philosophical,

3
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,653
humanitarian empathy
that was desperate to get out.

4
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,675
Dark Side, I think, felt like

5
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:15,515
the whole band
were working together.

6
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,147
It was a very creative time.
We were all very open, as well.

7
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:23,022
I think because we still had
a common goal,

8
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,357
which was to become
rich and famous.

9
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:41,171
The ideas that Roger
was exploring

10
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:45,182
apply to every new generation.

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:49,186
They still have very much
the same relevance as they had.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,261
Can we run back
and drop it a bit?

13
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:04,097
Yeah, you can if you like.
Just turn it down a bit.

14
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,694
I think one of the successes
of Dark Side

15
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,000
is the fact that, actually,
it's very rich.

16
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,975
There's a lot of songs,
a lot of ideas,

17
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:14,739
all compressed
onto the one record.

18
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:17,315
I can clearly remember

19
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:19,213
that moment
of sitting and listening

20
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,513
to the whole mix,
all the way through,

21
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,121
and thinking "My God.

22
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,680
"We've really done
something fantastic here."

23
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,847
I think it has
the all-time record.

24
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:52,678
Constantly on the charts
for nearly 750 weeks.

25
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,411
About 14 years.

26
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,613
It was a huge album.

27
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,917
Huge not just in terms
of its sales,

28
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,014
but in terms
of its influence.

29
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:04,186
This was where
underground music,

30
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,891
progressive rock, whatever,
really went mainstream.

31
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,525
It was a record that had lots of
traditional pop values.

32
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:12,228
You could sing along
to these songs. But...

33
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,862
it also was the kind of thing
that took you places,

34
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,963
if you wanted to listen to it
in a darkened room.

35
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,271
It may very well be
the ultimate concept record,

36
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,347
because the concept is there,
the songs are there,

37
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:24,438
the spaces
and the music are there,

38
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,882
but it doesn't take away
any of the imagination.

39
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:38,757
After Syd went crazy in '68
and Dave joined,

40
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,991
we were all of us searching.

41
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:45,729
Fumbling around, looking for
"well, where do we go now?"

42
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,329
Because here was the guy
who starts producing

43
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,635
all these songs,

44
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:54,439
and was the sort of heartbeat
of the band.

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,048
<i>Syd casts a long and large
shadow over events.</i>

46
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,980
I think that the band were
very impressive to keep going,

47
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,917
actually, after the loss
of their main creative drive.

48
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,250
I mean, it's not something
you'd choose, is it?

49
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,155
You wouldn't say "Okay, let's
get rid of our songwriter".

50
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,387
After Syd had gone,
the music became more

51
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,965
kind of soundscapes than songs.

52
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,330
You have to work
to your strengths.

53
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,928
And it's a very good thing
that we couldn't write singles.

54
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,974
We might not have done some of
the interesting work we did.

55
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:29,776
Once Syd was out of the picture,
The Floyd just went glacial.

56
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,373
They just let it all spread out.

57
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,291
When I saw The Floyd
for the first time,

58
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,126
it was the summer of '68.

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,393
It was the first American tour
with David Gilmour.

60
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,629
And they were
just extraordinary.

61
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:55,468
You know, it was
Let There Be More Light,

62
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,906
Set the Controls
for the Heart of the Sun,

63
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,307
it was total space rock.

64
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:13,324
I started falling
out of love with that,

65
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,792
with some of that
psychedelic noodling stuff.

66
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,988
We were still, then, playing

67
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,326
a lot of instrumental work,
if you like,

68
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,127
and that would be
half the album.

69
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,793
But we were always searching
for a direction.

70
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,668
You're fighting,
a little bit, between...

71
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:32,835
Wanting to push boundaries back
a little bit

72
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:36,972
and move forward
in an experimental way,

73
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,846
but also to retain melody.

74
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:43,944
When you get to Meddle,
quite clearly,

75
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:50,859
Echoes shows the direction
that we're moving in.

76
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,797
The rest of Meddle, as I recall,
was songs.

77
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:59,836
And so, you know, the flipside
was a 20-minute piece.

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,838
A, and so it was a construct,

79
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:08,435
And B, it was the beginning

80
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:12,449
of all the writing
about other people.

81
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,799
It was the beginning
of empathy, if you like.

82
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,926
You know, "Two strangers
passing in the street,

83
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,767
"By chance
two passing glances meet,

84
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,966
"And I am you
and what I see is me."

85
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,304
It's a sort of thread
that's gone through everything,

86
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,970
for me, ever since then,

87
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:48,383
and had a big irruption
in Dark Side.

88
00:06:48,475 --> 00:06:51,115
You have to remember
the context of the time.

89
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,748
This was the height
of glam rock.

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,418
There was, you know,
Marc Bolan in T-Rex,

91
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,827
and David Bowie
with Ziggy Stardust,

92
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,696
peddling their sort
of pop fantasies.

93
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,700
And The Floyd came along
with an album

94
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,429
that was about
these weighty themes.

95
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,733
He created a story.
He created...

96
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,001
Basically, a theatre piece

97
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,475
about what it was like
to live in the modern world.

98
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,274
All four of us were there,
and there was a discussion

99
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,371
about putting the album together

100
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,611
and making it into
this themed...

101
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:24,484
I mean, what is now called
a "concept album".

102
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,457
There are a number of things
that impinge upon an individual,

103
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:32,587
that colour his view
of existence.

104
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,699
There are pressures that are
capable of pushing you

105
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,428
in one direction or another.

106
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:41,199
And these are some of them,

107
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:46,607
and whether they push you
toward insanity, death, empathy,

108
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,974
greed, whatever...

109
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,910
There's something about

110
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:57,682
the Newtonian view
of that physics

111
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:01,054
that might be interesting,
and maybe that could be

112
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,855
what this record is about.

113
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,089
It was one of those
really good moments

114
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,824
that most bands do experience,

115
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:10,993
where everyone is onside
and everyone likes the idea

116
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,967
and there's some sort
of agreement

117
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,335
as to more or less
who's going to do what.

118
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,874
Dark Side of the Moon started
in a rehearsal room

119
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,001
in Bermondsey, I think,
that belonged...

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,341
A warehouse, belonged
to the Rolling Stones,

121
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:26,383
where we did
some sort of jamming,

122
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,453
writing, whatever you want
to call it.

123
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,621
I'm not sure how much writing
happened there.

124
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,886
You know. "Let's play E minor
and A for an hour or two.

125
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,394
"That sounds all right.
That'll take up five minutes."

126
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,780
A lot of the musical ideas
just came up

127
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,448
just sort of jamming away
in these rehearsal rooms.

128
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,320
Obviously, the lyrics
Roger brought in.

129
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:09,620
Because he had things to say.

130
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,663
And it's the first time
that he wrote all the lyrics.

131
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,699
Roger was our sort of
pushing, driving force.

132
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,327
The way Dark Side of the Moon
articulates some sense

133
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:22,930
of early adult disenchantment
is absolutely timeless.

134
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:28,536
I listened to it again recently,
and it always amazes me

135
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:34,278
that I got away with it, really,
'cause it's so lower sixth.

136
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,818
You know,

137
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:40,724
"Breathe, breathe in the air,
don't be afraid to care..."

138
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:43,293
In fact, I think,
within the context of the music

139
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,727
and within the context
of the piece as a whole,

140
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:50,892
people are prepared to accept
that simple exultation.

141
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,800
To be prepared
to stand your ground

142
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,397
and attempt to live your life
in an authentic way.

143
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:24,194
I came from jazz, basically.

144
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,568
I love... That's my favourite...
That's my inspiration.

145
00:10:28,695 --> 00:10:30,606
And the interesting thing
about this song,

146
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:35,407
talking about jazz,
there's a certain chord...

147
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,819
That is totally down to a chord

148
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:45,719
I had heard on, actually,
Miles Davis' album

149
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,155
Kind of Blue, which is...

150
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,997
That chord.
That chord, I just love.

151
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:57,795
And when we were doing Breathe,
we got to G, I got to G,

152
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,734
and how do you get to E again?

153
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,706
Well, again, normally,
you'd go...

154
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,339
But I remembered this chord,

155
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,006
and I remembered
working it out at home,

156
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,278
listening to the record.
And I just thought...

157
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,994
Dave was brilliant
at double-tracking vocals.

158
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:37,973
You could do it with machines,
but there's a difference.

159
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,585
There's also a harmony part.

160
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,353
That's it on its own.

161
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,197
And back to the band.

162
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,165
There's two organ parts
which come in now.

163
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:18,139
They had been performing
this work known as Eclipse

164
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,775
for a few months, I think,

165
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,818
before actually even coming in
to Abbey Road

166
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,049
to start the first recordings.

167
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:30,719
Which meant the performances
were pretty tight,

168
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,693
and not so hard to get.

169
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,356
When you're working in a band
and you're performing something

170
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,801
willy-nilly, it develops
and changes.

171
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:06,293
In pre-bootlegging days,
this, of course,

172
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,026
was a far more effective
and better way of doing things.

173
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,830
You went into the studio
rehearsed up.

174
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,182
We'd been playing it live
that way for quite some time,

175
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,912
as a sort of guitar jam piece.

176
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:31,113
I think we were none of us
that happy with it

177
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,818
<i>as a piece, and when
we also had this synthesiser.</i>

178
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,021
The Synth EA, which had
a little built-in keyboard,

179
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,758
and it had... it was
the first sequencer, I think.

180
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,458
I just plugged this up

181
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,002
and started playing
one sequence on it.

182
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,595
Roger immediately pricked up
his ears. "That sounded good."

183
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:53,006
And he came out and we started
mucking with it together.

184
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,807
And then he put in
a new sequence of notes,

185
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,314
and it all developed
out of that.

186
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,386
A series of notes,
played in slowly...

187
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,423
...triggering a noise generator
and oscillators,

188
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,891
and then just speed it up,
you know.

189
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:18,329
Now you've got it, basically.

190
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,105
And that, of course, immediately
sounded much more exciting

191
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,645
and newer than what
we were currently doing.

192
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,511
They were the first band
to really go out

193
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:34,015
and try to, sort of,
make music of the future.

194
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,053
We were doing a lot of things
with tape loops

195
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,917
and curious sounds
and sound effects.

196
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:41,116
There wasn't sampling in 1972,
when they put this together,

197
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,785
but that's basically what
they were doing. In a sense,

198
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,763
they were giving you a preview
of sound-pictures of the future.

199
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:52,769
There are some very, very clever
and highly listenable

200
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:56,033
pieces of
sonic experimentation.

201
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:57,835
This is the main synthesiser.

202
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,570
It has the hi-hat element
built in.

203
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:03,909
Then we treat it with filters
and with other oscillators

204
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:06,210
to give it that sort of
vibrato noise.

205
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,342
And we bring in this guitar,

206
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,012
which is a backwards guitar
with echo stuff on it,

207
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,987
and it's being played
with a mic-stand leg,

208
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,025
just sliding up it...

209
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:18,391
And that whizzes left and right
across the stereo.

210
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:22,796
Then there's these synthesisers,
morph synthies,

211
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,369
which are creating sort of
futuristic vehicle noises,

212
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,665
which you take the pitch down

213
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,502
a little bit, and pan it
at the same time,

214
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,008
and that creates
an artificial Doppler sound

215
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,011
like ambulances
whizzing past you.

216
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:40,584
Bring in some footsteps
and some heartbeats

217
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:41,913
for extra tension.

218
00:15:42,008 --> 00:15:44,545
As you see, there's an awful lot
going on in this track.

219
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,866
This section in particular,
the travel section,

220
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,200
the On the Run section,

221
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,638
I think, was pretty complicated.

222
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,074
A lot of hands on deck.

223
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,111
You'd always want
to put more things on

224
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:11,011
than you had tracks for.

225
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,083
So tracks would, very suddenly,

226
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:14,708
change from one thing
to a different thing.

227
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:18,482
All of us are on the desk
with our fingers on the faders.

228
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,648
But that was the way
it was, because

229
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,225
we didn't have automation
in those days.

230
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,955
A mix, in those days,
was a performance,

231
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,531
<i>every bit as much
as doing a gig.</i>

232
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,633
It's one thing, actually,
that we've kind of lost

233
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,133
in the modern age.

234
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,781
It was very,
very well-engineered.

235
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,651
It was also very,
very carefully constructed.

236
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:55,419
So there was no sort of...
Everything was well-recorded.

237
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,519
Dark Side was really
the first proper engineering job

238
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,996
I'd been given with The Floyd.

239
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,191
So I was pretty much
in at the deep end.

240
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:05,097
<i>He was very good musically,
as well.</i>

241
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,003
He also came up with
a couple of good ideas.

242
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:11,665
I was commissioned to record

243
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:14,643
some clocks
for a sound effects record,

244
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,611
for the very early days
of quadraphonic.

245
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,411
And when we were doing Time,

246
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,544
he suggested we might like
to add these clocks.

247
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,919
My memory of it
is just this room

248
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:30,483
full of tapes rolling round,
because it was...

249
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:33,029
Without any sort
of computer help,

250
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,599
everything had to be
done manually.

251
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,998
Getting all the clocks to chime
at the right time,

252
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,128
that was a process of...

253
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,730
Just finding a particular moment

254
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,332
on the multi-track tape
where the chiming would happen,

255
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,777
and then back-timing
all the quarter-inch originals

256
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:52,179
which contained
each of the clocks.

257
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,148
And then,
the very critical thing

258
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,413
of the tapes starting
at a specific moment,

259
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,389
which is all done
with hand-signs and stopwatches.

260
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:34,554
We've got the girls making
their first appearance here.

261
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,394
That's unprocessed.

262
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:49,036
And we put this effect called
a frequency translator on them,

263
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,805
which made them sound like this.

264
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,243
Here's the solo.

265
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,014
This one had probably
taken some shape live

266
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,846
before we ever got to do it.

267
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:37,921
But usually, in the studio,
on this sort of thing,

268
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,157
you just go out and have a play
and see what comes,

269
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,889
and it's usually mostly
the first take that's the best,

270
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,488
and you'll find yourself
repeating yourself thereafter.

271
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:07,674
The 1970s was the era
of the guitar.

272
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,223
And he had that sort of
very blues-y sound.

273
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,622
But then, also,
he had that other sound,

274
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:20,391
that spacy, very crystalline,
almost ethereal quality.

275
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,194
I suddenly realised then,
that year,

276
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,168
that life was already happening.

277
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,603
I think it's because my mother
was so obsessed with education

278
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:09,008
and the idea that childhood
and adolescence and everything

279
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,174
was about preparing for a life
that was going to start later.

280
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,655
And I suddenly realised that
life wasn't gonna start later,

281
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:21,850
that it, you know...
It starts at "dot".

282
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,791
And it happens all the time.

283
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,488
At any point,
you can grasp the reins

284
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,590
and start guiding
your own destiny.

285
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,828
And that was a big revelation
to me.

286
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:34,996
I mean, it came as
quite a shock.

287
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,956
One of the greatest lines,
I think,

288
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,997
on Dark Side of the Moon
is Roger's line about

289
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,533
"Hanging on in quiet desperation
is the English way".

290
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,570
Which is the sort of line
you could imagine, I don't know,

291
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,970
Evelyn Waugh,
or Somerset Maugham or someone,

292
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,474
<i>writing as an observation
on the English character.</i>

293
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,877
And I think that character
does permeate the whole record,

294
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,882
and indeed the whole
of Pink Floyd's career.

295
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:20,466
It expresses my feelings
about things very simply,

296
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,203
and I think that...

297
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:30,316
Musically... I think
that the music is to some extent

298
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:35,323
driven by that
emotional commitment.

299
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,291
The band basically wanted

300
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:40,990
another four or five minutes
of music,

301
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,327
and we thought it could be
an instrumental.

302
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,696
I think I just,
as I always have done,

303
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,793
I sat at the piano and I...

304
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:50,564
And those first two chords came.

305
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:53,233
Us and Them
and The Great Gig in the Sky,

306
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,869
you know, are fabulous
chord sequences,

307
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,481
and really, truly wonderful
pieces of music.

308
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:49,487
No idea whose idea it was
to get a female singer in.

309
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:52,926
Alan Parsons knew Clare Torry
and had been working with her,

310
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,554
and said
"Why don't you try her?"

311
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,929
She just went in there
and improvised over it.

312
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,933
Yeah, that was amazing,
that was fantastic.

313
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:00,628
That was done
while we were mixing.

314
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,466
We knew what we wanted.

315
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,007
Not exactly musically,
but we knew

316
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,738
that we wanted someone to
just improvise over this piece.

317
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:12,338
So we directed her. We said,
"Well, think about death.

318
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,440
"Think about horror.
Think whatever,

319
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,315
"and just go and sing."

320
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,582
And my memory is
that she went out

321
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,352
in the studio and did it
very, very quickly.

322
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:26,019
And then came back in and said
"I'm really sorry", in fact,

323
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,995
"about this."
Very embarrassed.

324
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,964
And we were in the studio
saying "This is wonderful."

325
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:34,402
And of course,
it's absolutely brilliant.

326
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:37,906
Both Rick's piano and organ work

327
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:43,378
and Clare's singing
is just incredibly moving.

328
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:56,784
At the end,
at the very end of this

329
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,694
I'm going to increase
the echo slowly.

330
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,801
We always wanted to, kind of,

331
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:44,306
not be on our covers ourselves,
not have pictures.

332
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,809
It's probably the most
recognisable cover of all time.

333
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,174
It's something that you can sit
and look at for a long time

334
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:52,249
without getting fed up with it.

335
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:56,376
The prism is the logo that
absolutely defines the record.

336
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,751
Dark Side of the Moon
prism design

337
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,915
comes from three
basic ingredients,

338
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,186
one of which is the light show

339
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,990
that the band put on.
I was trying to represent that.

340
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,894
Also one of the themes
of the lyrics, which was,

341
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:11,593
I think, about ambition
and greed.

342
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,135
And thirdly it was an answer
to Rick Wright,

343
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,762
who said that
he wanted something...

344
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,773
Simple and bold. And dramatic.

345
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:23,142
<i>The presentation, as we call it,
of the design to the band</i>

346
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,442
was a fairly brief affair.

347
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,450
He just brought in
three or four ideas.

348
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,646
I do remember
instantly seeing the pyramid.

349
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:33,552
They came in,
and they looked around,

350
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,647
and they went...
"That one."

351
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,693
Everyone immediately went

352
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,127
"Terrific. Great.
Let's do that."

353
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,096
As epitomised by their ability
to choose it so quickly

354
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:46,032
and so easily, I just think
it's somehow very fitting.

355
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:48,400
I mean, it's hard to imagine it
without it, isn't it, really?

356
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:02,418
The story in America
had been a sort of disaster,

357
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,010
that, really,
we hadn't sold records.

358
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,420
And like all good artists,
the first thing you do

359
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,617
is blame the record company.

360
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,854
But in this particular case,

361
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,930
I think we might
get a few more people to agree

362
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,896
that they hadn't
performed properly.

363
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:19,993
And so they brought in a man
called Bhaskar Menon,

364
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,604
who was absolutely terrific,

365
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,367
and he decided
he was going to make this work,

366
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,171
and he was going to make
the American company

367
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,940
sell this record. And he did!

368
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,811
We devised
a marketing campaign for this

369
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:35,976
which was far more extensive

370
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,418
than anything that the company
had ever done.

371
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:43,220
It was an album that came after
virtually a year of touring.

372
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:47,559
There was a tremendous amount
of credible press.

373
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,893
We had, by this time,
without a single,

374
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:52,594
got this album tremendous sales.

375
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,726
Close to about 1,000,000 albums
by that stage,

376
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,806
you know, which was
quite remarkable.

377
00:29:56,928 --> 00:30:00,501
And I knew a time would come
when we would have to

378
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,875
get onto the next stage.

379
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,574
To get to the next category,
or level, of audience.

380
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,812
We really would need
some single-like material.

381
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,583
They always say, you know,
"You need a hit single,"

382
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,023
and we had a sort of hit single
with Money.

383
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:41,283
You know, I would have
remembered writing Money

384
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:45,082
as a sort of very blues-y thing.

385
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,521
I can't sing it up in
that register, but...

386
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:23,458
And it's a very
kind of transatlantic,

387
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,994
you know, blues-y
sort of twang to it all.

388
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,598
Listening to the original demo,
it's not like that at all.

389
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:32,134
It's all very, kind of, prissy
and very English.

390
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:36,036
The one thing about Money
that I think people forget

391
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,005
is that it's got the weirdest...

392
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,576
One of the biggest hits, with
the weirdest time signature.

393
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:43,441
Very unusual, 7/8 time.

394
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,177
Good riff.

395
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,539
I'd played in a band with Dick

396
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,735
when we were sort of
teenagers in Cambridge.

397
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,541
Dick was sort of
part of the Cambridge Mafia.

398
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,046
I didn't know
any other sax players,

399
00:32:57,142 --> 00:33:00,123
and I'm probably too nervous
to ask anyone we'd heard of.

400
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,714
He was terrific.

401
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:05,925
Well, Dick did his sax solo
in seven-time.

402
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:08,759
And then we sort of sat
and worked out

403
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:11,198
a different sequence
for the guitar solo.

404
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,360
Probably to make my life easier,

405
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,233
so I didn't have to think
about the timing.

406
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,738
I love the fact
that it does change.

407
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:20,002
And, you see, lots of things
happen on Dark Side

408
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,168
that, for me,
are kind of magical,

409
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,146
without us intentionally
making them happen.

410
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,114
They just happen.

411
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,446
And I think that's one of
the great things about Money,

412
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,748
is that it does
change time signatures.

413
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,221
And that's the thing.
It goes back into the 4/4,

414
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,087
and all of a sudden, man,
it's rock city.

415
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,337
Money is an amazing single,
because it's about

416
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:25,738
the very thing that it became.
It's about success.

417
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,832
Something certainly
did the trick,

418
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:30,379
and it moved us up
into a super-league,

419
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:32,709
I suppose you might say.

420
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:40,351
Which brought with it
some great joy, some pride,

421
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,958
and some problems.

422
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,254
'Course it changed our life.

423
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,591
We were now
a big rock 'n' roll band

424
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,393
playing in stadiums.

425
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,330
You don't know
what you're in it for any more.

426
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,870
You know, you're in it
to achieve massive success,

427
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,474
and get rich and famous
and all those other things

428
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:00,474
that go along with it.

429
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,569
And when they're all
suddenly done, you're going

430
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,547
"Well, why? What next?"

431
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,549
It's not to say we didn't do
some good work.

432
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,678
But the good work that we did
was actually all about

433
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,723
a lot of the negative aspects
of what went on

434
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:20,058
after we'd achieved the goal.

435
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,291
I mean, that obviously informed

436
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:26,369
what turned out to be
the next album, quite deeply.

437
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,164
Wish You Were Here.

438
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,796
'Cause we weren't, most of us,
most of the time.

439
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,876
They were
a platinum monster, and...

440
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,606
It's not a lot of fun.

441
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,014
It's sort of

442
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:49,581
amazing to me now
that we had that piece of music

443
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:54,653
in 1969, when we recorded
the music for Zabriskie Point.

444
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:58,394
And throughout, I guess,
Atom Heart Mother,

445
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,266
the Obscured by Clouds album,
the Meddle album,

446
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,829
we didn't dig it out and use it.
It's such a lovely piece.

447
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,753
Antonioni didn't really know
what he wanted.

448
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,380
He needed, desperately,
to have control.

449
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,857
So even if you did
the right thing,

450
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,053
and it was perfect,
he couldn't bear to accept it

451
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,858
because there wasn't a choice.

452
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,092
All he really wanted was
Careful with that Axe, Eugene.

453
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,226
And I think we were all getting
a bit frustrated.

454
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,769
"What does he want?"

455
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,839
I think I was just sitting
in the studio,

456
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,874
and I was sitting at the piano,

457
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,603
and they happened to have
this violent sequence up,

458
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,579
and I was watching it.

459
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:47,013
Probably because I was feeling
a bit tired, or whatever,

460
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:49,244
I just started
the chord sequence.

461
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,376
At the time, I think,
everyone thought

462
00:36:51,476 --> 00:36:53,046
"This is really good."

463
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,149
When we thought we'd really got
something brilliant

464
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,989
for his movie,

465
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:03,061
Antonioni would say

466
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,465
"ls beautiful, but is too sad."

467
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,164
You know?
"It makes me think of church."

468
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:12,867
It was obviously waiting
to be reborn in this album.

469
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,548
The lyrics are so direct
and linear.

470
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,882
Those fundamental issues

471
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,891
of whether or not the human race
is capable of being humane.

472
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:35,421
What's good about
the writing of this song,

473
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,500
from my point of view,

474
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,035
is the leaving of the gaps
for the repeat echo.

475
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:52,371
It's kind of strange, hearing it
without the echo, isn't it?

476
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,303
I find myself,
with instrumentalists,

477
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,875
over the years
working with people,

478
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:23,571
having very, very often,
as a producer,

479
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,909
in my capacity
for producing records,

480
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:29,611
having to say to people
"No, leave a hole.

481
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,153
"You know, just play
for half a bar,

482
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,884
"and then leave a bar and a half
free. You know, empty."

483
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:38,221
And that's kind of
what that song is.

484
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,887
You know,
that's the way it works.

485
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,932
The simplicity of Floyd is
almost hard to talk about,

486
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,730
because it is so simple.

487
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:51,205
Nick Mason playing
very slowly. You know, exact,

488
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,003
without a lot of

489
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:58,877
overly frilly
percussion flourishes.

490
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,811
Richard's touch
on piano and organ,

491
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,284
very gentle, very soft.

492
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:08,880
But also exact, and just
hitting the notes right.

493
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,425
It was always about
leaving space.

494
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,479
I think Dave and Rick,

495
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,212
their harmony vocals on it
are really very affecting.

496
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,618
Funnily enough,
they have very similar voices.

497
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,317
Both their voices are
a big factor in Dark Side,

498
00:39:42,413 --> 00:39:44,415
the way they...
The way they blend.

499
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,292
That's Dave and Rick together.

500
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,335
And then Rick does another part
below that,

501
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,904
which you're gonna hear now.

502
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,873
And then the girls
are also joining in.

503
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,511
It seemed to me
really important,

504
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,887
I've no idea why it did,

505
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:52,017
to have voices on this thing.

506
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,154
The only thing that was clever
about it was how to do it,

507
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:57,790
so not to...
Not to have an interview.

508
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,459
Devised, probably,
in the canteen,

509
00:41:00,591 --> 00:41:03,731
and done later that evening.

510
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:07,605
So I wrote out a bunch of cards
with questions on them.

511
00:41:07,732 --> 00:41:10,042
I think what the voices did
on the record was,

512
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,011
they actually brought out
the "Dark Side".

513
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,275
They were, in a way,
the Dark Side of the Record!

514
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,282
First of all, we used
a number of people

515
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,684
who were in the studio with us.
So we used

516
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:20,653
three or four
of our road crew...

517
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:22,782
I aren't frightened
of dying at all,

518
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,019
'cause when you've gotta go,
you've gotta go.

519
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,096
The Irish doorman here, Gerry.

520
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:29,563
Why should I be frightened
of dying?

521
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,134
See no reason for it.
You've got to go sometime.

522
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,361
Wings were recording in here
at the same time,

523
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:36,996
so we used Paul and Linda,
Henry McCullough...

524
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,404
I don't know.
I was really drunk at the time.

525
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,875
It's the people who are
not used to being interviewed

526
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,571
who come up with the stuff.

527
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:48,014
I think they started off with
"What's your favourite colour?"

528
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:51,144
And your favourite food.
And none of which was...

529
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,653
it was just to get people there.

530
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:55,122
Then they went into "When was
the last time you were violent?"

531
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:58,422
This was the good bit. "When was
the last time you were violent?"

532
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,122
And then you'd take...
You'd answer it, and then

533
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:03,995
take the next card, and it said
"Were you in the right?"

534
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:07,797
Yeah, I was in the right.

535
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,962
Yes, absolutely in the right.

536
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,971
I certainly was in the right.

537
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:15,134
Definitely. That geezer
was cruising for a bruising.

538
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,874
And this remarkable roadie
called Roger The Hat.

539
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,415
If I participate
in this fuckin' effort,

540
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:24,214
I hope I'm gonna get
my gold disc at the end of it.

541
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:26,584
Imagine that, huh?

542
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:29,317
They tried to track him down
to do the cards,

543
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,893
and by the time
they got hold of him,

544
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,757
the cards had gone missing.
I don't know where they'd gone.

545
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:37,130
So Roger Waters actually
ended up doing it...

546
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,030
He actually did do that one
as an interview.

547
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,502
Do you ever think
you're going mad, Roger?

548
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,400
I once reached a stage
in my life

549
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,877
when I was completely convinced
that I'd gone over the brink.

550
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,675
Well, that's what
I care to call it.

551
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,187
It was obviously
a bit to do with Syd, and...

552
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:16,404
I think it's about defending
the notion of being different.

553
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,099
The fundamental question
that's facing us all

554
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:29,035
is whether or not
we're capable of dealing with

555
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:31,037
the whole question
of "us and them".

556
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:33,699
What he was feeling
as an individual

557
00:45:33,798 --> 00:45:38,076
mirrored almost exactly
what a lot of other people

558
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,206
were feeling, at the time,
in their own lives.

559
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:42,341
There's no question in my mind
that Dark Side of the Moon

560
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,511
was one of the most important
artistic statements

561
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,486
of the last 50 years, probably.

562
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:50,491
It's touched very many people,
all over the world,

563
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,357
in ways that could not simply be
put down to the fact that,

564
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:56,762
oh, they're nice tunes,
and I like that bit at the end.

565
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:58,663
I mean, this was
a complete experience.

566
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:01,566
It was actually
a really grim time.

567
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,265
And he wrote a very grim record,

568
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:10,335
but did it with music
that was extremely uplifting,

569
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,471
compelling and bewitching.

570
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,777
I think it was
a very, very happy

571
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,877
and creative and enjoyable time
when we made this album.

572
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,288
It was probably the most focused
moment in our career,

573
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:26,395
in terms of all of us
working together as a band.

574
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,794
I'd love to have been a person

575
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,493
who could sit back
with his headphones on

576
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:34,763
and listen to that
the whole way through,

577
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,600
for the first time.

578
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:40,608
You know, I never had
that experience, but...

579
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:42,575
it would have been nice.

580
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,375
The thing that's often missed
is the fact that, basically,

581
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,006
people are responding to it
on an emotional level.

582
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,176
And that's what makes
great records.

583
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:53,414
It's driven by emotion.

584
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,684
There's nothing plastic
about it, you know?

585
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,852
There's nothing contrived
about it.

586
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,589
And I think
that's what has given it...

587
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,895
Well, maybe one of the things
that's given it its longevity.

588
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,005
But that's not to say
that the potential

589
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,135
for the sun to shine
doesn't exist.

590
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:25,646
You know, walk down the path
towards the light,

591
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,580
rather than walking
into the darkness.

592
00:48:28,672 --> 00:48:31,084
There is no dark side
in the moon, really.

593
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,086
Matter of fact, it's all dark.

1
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:19,830
There's a tendency
within most societies

2
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,834
to try and force everybody
into a particular regimen,

3
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,434
and to stop people
walking on the grass.

4
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,841
There's something, I suppose,
about that particular lyric.

5
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:37,882
There's something about the idea
of producing grass

6
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,612
and then not letting anybody
enjoy it, you know?

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,621
"Let's make a beautiful lawn,

8
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,920
"and then not let anybody
walk on it, or play on it,

9
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:51,291
"or kick a ball about on it,
or do anything on it."

10
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,855
And in a way,
it's the idea of...

11
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,698
Of, actually, the desire
to walk on the grass

12
00:00:58,792 --> 00:01:00,499
being mad.

13
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,040
You know, there's something

14
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,544
wrong about that.

15
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,842
And the piece of grass
that I had in my mind is...

16
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:14,079
There's a big square lump
of grass

17
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:18,919
between King's College Chapel
and the River Cam in Cambridge,

18
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,686
which, I don't know why,

19
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,388
but that's actually the bit
of grass I was thinking about

20
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,464
when I was writing that thing.

21
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,658
Which is a very "keep off" bit.

22
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:27,798
The choruses of the song are
about saying to the audience,

23
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:33,776
"Look, I know this all feels
a bit wacky from time to time."

24
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,141
And it certainly does to me.

25
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,443
I have trouble making sense
of all this.

26
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,008
We all make mistakes.
We're all human, you know.

27
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:46,488
You can't expect to be perfect,
or behave perfectly or whatever.

28
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,959
But if, you know...

29
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:55,763
If, through your efforts,
if you like,

30
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,065
your own internal efforts,
you can give

31
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:04,407
the empathetic side
of your nature

32
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,602
a better chance

33
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,476
in its battle
against the devil within you,

34
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,515
then so be it.

35
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,779
And that is a struggle
that we can all engage in,

36
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,752
every day of our lives.

37
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:31,160
I made up the rhythm tape

38
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,966
in a shed
at the bottom of the garden.

39
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,734
My wife, then, was a potter.

40
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,504
She had a pottery studio
at the bottom of the garden,

41
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,909
and I had a little music studio
next to it.

42
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:46,610
She had a big metal mixing bowl
for mixing up clay.

43
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:51,553
And so I went "Oh! I know how
to make the rhythm for this."

44
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,625
And I had a Revox A77.

45
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,489
I only had two-track machines,
at the time, at home.

46
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,688
And so I got a microphone out
and put it

47
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,891
by the mixing bowl
and threw a handful of coins in.

48
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,331
"Right, that's one noise."

49
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,494
And then tore some paper up.
"Right, that's another one."

50
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,869
Searched around for the sound
of a cash register or something.

51
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:13,377
And thought "it's in 7/8, okay,"
so I cut up seven pieces of tape

52
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,447
of those sound effects,
exactly the same length,

53
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,814
and spliced them together
and stuck it in the Revox,

54
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,978
going around a mic-stand
to hold it like that,

55
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,885
and pressed the button,
and that was it.

56
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:33,087
We actually made the loop
onto a four-track tape,

57
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,165
which meant that

58
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,826
the seven different sounds
could walk around the room.

59
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,066
Although it's not perfect,
because it's seven in a bar,

60
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,803
not eight, so it doesn't make it
wrap quite round the room

61
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,175
on the eighth beat,
which isn't there.

62
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:50,976
But you could probably say that
this was one of the first times

63
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,245
that a band played to a loop.

64
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,151
I can't think of
an earlier instance than this.

65
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,223
They were hearing that
in their headphones.

66
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,919
They just counted off
and played in sync with this.

67
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,257
And then, like on the record,
I faded it out

68
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,127
once the band
had started playing.

69
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,359
We start off with
the bass guitar.

70
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,062
There it is.
And then we double-track it

71
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,468
with this guitar,

72
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:20,637
which is like this. And then
we bring in a tremolo guitar.

73
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,640
That one. We'll stick that one
into the mix.

74
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,211
And then there's two more,

75
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,813
which are doing
sort of offbeat things.

76
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:38,190
There, that's this one...

77
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,798
And this one.

78
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:50,999
And they sort of feature
across with Rick's keyboards,

79
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,701
which are here.

80
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,778
And then let's bring
all that stuff in.

81
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:17,597
So this is gonna be the vocal
without any processing at all.

82
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,815
And then I can add in a delay,

83
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,852
which brings it to life
a little bit more.

84
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,882
And then some reverb,
which will give it some space.

85
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,521
Here comes the guitar solo.

86
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,252
Played there,
then learnt and double-tracked

87
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,264
<i>as precisely as one can do it
on left and right</i>

88
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,858
for the first of these three
sort of guitar solos.

89
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,962
Two performances,
double-tracked.

90
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:34,367
And all the effects, again,
David was generating himself.

91
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,814
This sounds like me.

92
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,821
This is where I cut it,
right now.

93
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,927
It goes absolutely to nothing.

94
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,528
It goes really small.
There's no delays, no reverb,

95
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,630
just virgin sounds.

96
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,712
I mean, their idea of, like,
coming down to where it's dry...

97
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,750
That was already there

98
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,844
on the rough mix that I had
of this stuff.

99
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,514
But I just wanted to build it up
and make stuff bigger.

100
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,957
In other words, by tracking it,
and by using more echo.

101
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,053
This is where the echo
comes back in again.

102
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,201
So this is the third one.

103
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,136
It goes into
the double-tracked one,

104
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:40,233
which is this one
on its own, and then it's...

105
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,645
By the means of trickery,
ADT-ed, you get

106
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,518
two of them. It's the same one,

107
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,645
and they're sort of
very slightly delayed.

108
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,518
This is because it's got

109
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:56,360
that note,
and one or two others.

110
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,622
It's too high
for my Stratocaster,

111
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,722
so that's why I used
that Lewis guitar I showed you.

112
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:17,881
As we know, money is
a real addiction for most of us.

113
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,178
That was one of the things,
for me personally,

114
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,616
about Dark Side Of The Moon,

115
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,244
when it finally
became successful.

116
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,620
At that point, I had to
decide whether I really was,

117
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,159
you know, a socialist or not.

118
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,855
'Cause if you've suddenly got
a few quid,

119
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:34,693
you've got to decide
if you're going to hang onto it.

120
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,199
Whether you put it in the bank
or whatever you do with it,

121
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,793
it will be invested by somebody,

122
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,271
so you have to decide whether
to become a capitalist or not.

123
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:15,729
<i>All that was basically
the same as in Zabriskie Point.</i>

124
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:20,800
Why I liked it was because
it's all on a pedal D.

125
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,346
So all the chords actually...

126
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,874
'Cause it could have gone...

127
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,994
I mean, that is basically
the same chords,

128
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,133
but instead of being...
That was a D to a B minor.

129
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,599
And then an A, and...

130
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,043
But I just liked it
just sort of rolling along

131
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,115
so that all these chords
relate to the D.

132
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,850
I love that chord.
I don't know why. lt just...

133
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:11,718
But it wouldn't work
if I'd gone up to an A.

134
00:14:11,818 --> 00:14:14,731
But that's what music
is all about, you know?

135
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:19,269
So that was that,
and then, I think...

136
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,703
That was the sequence
that came to the studio,

137
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,172
and then we wanted a chorus,

138
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,903
and I just wrote
the three chords.

139
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,848
That was written in the studio.

140
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,688
Of the songs that Roger and I
have written together,

141
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:46,229
I would say that's, for me,
my favourite.

142
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,733
My world view
is very similar now.

143
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,037
We are the products, I think,
of our early childhood.

144
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,303
My theory is that after
you hit five or six years old,

145
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,382
not a lot changes,

146
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,077
fundamentally.

147
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,211
And the pain that we experience,

148
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,414
or the joy, or the love,
or the whatever,

149
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,752
all the experiences that we have
as young children, I think,

150
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,350
stay with us forever.

151
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,455
And they are...
You know, they provide us

152
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:46,435
with the rationale
that shapes our adult lives.

153
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,131
I certainly think
that's true of me.

154
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:52,209
And I have
the same feelings now.

155
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:57,505
And in a way,
that's why I can still...

156
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,915
I've been listening to
Dark Side Of The Moon recently,

157
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:06,479
simply because James Guthrie
has been making a 5.1 mix of it,

158
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,253
and so I've had to go
and listen to it,

159
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:12,261
you know, and say what I think.

160
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,958
And one thing I thought
the first time I sat there

161
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,935
in the chair, and all this stuff
was going on around me, was

162
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,738
how those fundamental issues

163
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,835
of whether or not

164
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,742
the human race is capable
of being humane

165
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,919
are still right in our faces
30 years later. Now, that...

166
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,618
Within the perspective
of history, one would say

167
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:46,219
"What a fucking stupid thing
to say. Of course they are."

168
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,788
It's only 30 years. It's like...
It's a nanosecond.

169
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:51,800
It's a nothing.
It's irrelevant. You know?

170
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,599
This little bit of history
that we live in, we tend to...

171
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,265
We make a lot of it, because
we're here and we're watching it

172
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,139
and it means a lot to us because
we're alive at the moment.

173
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,269
But we won't be
in a few years' time,

174
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,279
and things will continue.

175
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,907
But the fundamental question
that's facing us all

176
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:11,011
is whether or not
we're capable of dealing with

177
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,817
the whole question
of "us and them".

178
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:18,359
I think. That's my...
That's something I always had.

179
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:21,364
I had that bit when I was
a teenager, and when I was...

180
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,264
When I was the chairman
of the YCND in Cambridge

181
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:29,066
when I was 15 years old,
or whatever, things basically...

182
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,801
if you've been given,

183
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,538
I think, the gift
of having that perspective,

184
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:42,143
you don't lose it.
And I suspect it's quite hard,

185
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,916
you know,
if you're fundamentally inclined

186
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,218
to be a member
of the Ku Klux Klan,

187
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:51,056
to shrug that off
in later years, as well.

188
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:54,723
I think it's likely
that you go on, you know,

189
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,666
wanting to lynch people forever.

190
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:02,934
Maybe not.
Maybe I shouldn't say that.

191
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,770
There is an optimistic
side of me that thinks,

192
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,744
that feels that
not just individuals,

193
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:14,409
but hierarchies, authorities,
are capable of rehabilitation.

194
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,044
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to think that G. W. Bush

195
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:20,716
was capable of transcending
his background

196
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:24,260
and becoming a person
who could understand

197
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,321
broader and more fundamental
issues of human contact

198
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,860
than that kind of sheriff thing
that he's got going for him?

199
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:39,371
Which is all that
Dark Side Of The Moon is about.

200
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,215
When I went back and listened
to it a few years ago,

201
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,658
when I was going on the road
and I was trying to decide

202
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,558
what songs to play off it,

203
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:15,962
things like
the introduction of Time...

204
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,900
My brain kept saying
"Now it's gonna...

205
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,838
"Oh, it goes round again?
Okay, now it's gonna change.

206
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,502
"Oh, no." And it's interminable.
You know, it just seems...

207
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,978
The Rototom bit seems to go on
forever and ever and ever.

208
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:35,018
And it's great. I like it,
you know, but it's...

209
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:37,348
There was
what would have seemed,

210
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:39,889
20 years later, like a bravery

211
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,459
in allowing stuff
just to sit there

212
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:46,018
and sort of vamp for
what seems like hour after hour.

213
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,827
And just to allow it to,
you know, have its own pace

214
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,266
and not to feel
that you've got to change,

215
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,099
or keep people's interest,
or suddenly have

216
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,673
some different kind
of information going on.

217
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,139
And that's good.

218
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,333
Everybody who goes
into rock 'n' roll,

219
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,674
you know, wants to make
a mark of some kind.

220
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:29,082
As a demonstration of rebellion,

221
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,018
or because they can't think

222
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,283
of any other way
to make a lot of money,

223
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:38,589
or because they want
to pull girls, or whatever.

224
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,060
You know, there's no purity

225
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:42,962
in the motivation
for rock 'n' roll.

226
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,535
However, those people
that are successful in it

227
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,103
normally have...

228
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,335
And that last a bit,
normally have

229
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:57,608
some other axe to grind,

230
00:28:57,703 --> 00:29:00,980
which is, in some way,
fundamentally connected

231
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,780
to the experience
of many others,

232
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:05,718
otherwise we wouldn't buy
their records.

233
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:08,382
I wouldn't go and buy
Neil Young's records

234
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,461
unless I felt
a fundamental attachment

235
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,190
to his preoccupations with love

236
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:17,597
and life and liberty
and so on and so forth.

237
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:20,033
And the same way
with any of my other heroes.

238
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:23,902
Lennon, or Dylan,
or, you know, whoever.

239
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:32,111
However, I don't think
any of us in rock 'n' roll

240
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,947
are solely motivated
by the noble

241
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:41,755
desire to share our wisdom

242
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,657
with, you know,
with the rest of mankind.

243
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,560
I think we'd do something else

244
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:53,432
if that was
the primary motivation.

245
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,380
Chris Thomas, obviously
a well-known producer even then,

246
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,610
even in the early '70s.

247
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,046
The band felt they needed
a fresh pair of ears,

248
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:18,758
which was probably
a justifiable thought.

249
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,490
And Chris and I, I think,
worked pretty well together.

250
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,862
Suddenly, somebody who wasn't
an engineer was coming in

251
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,299
and saying "Can we compress
the guitar on this?"

252
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,736
"Can we compress that? More echo
on that?" and all the rest.

253
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,830
And I think,
to this day, Alan...

254
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,967
if you actually say,
"ls there any one thing,

255
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:36,444
"is there anything you're
not happy about on the record?",

256
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:39,516
it's always like "I don't like
the compression on it."

257
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:43,950
We occasionally disagreed on...
On compression,

258
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,988
and a number of issues
like that,

259
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:49,548
but essentially, I think,
he helped the process along,

260
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,559
helped make it into
a better record.

261
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,256
A lot of work had gone into it
up to that point.

262
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,924
It was a question
of finishing the record off.

263
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,366
It wasn't one of these ones
where "We'll fix it in the mix,"

264
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,870
and there's loads and loads
of stuff to sort out.

265
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,271
Wasn't like that at all.
It had been carefully planned.

266
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:10,473
Chris was an inspired choice,
because having made the album,

267
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,540
we really did get bogged down
into the mixing.

268
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,846
Maybe Dave and I were beginning
to argue about things.

269
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,819
I'm not sure.
That may not be true.

270
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:22,016
He came in
for just the mix sessions,

271
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:27,462
and helped to find a compromise

272
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,624
between the way Roger saw it
and the way I saw it.

273
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,963
Dave, Roger, me and Nick

274
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:36,369
all had different ideas
about how to mix.

275
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,465
Whether it's how loud
the voice-overs are,

276
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:43,137
how much reverb
to put on the drums,

277
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,340
levels of vocals...

278
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:47,439
There weren't
violent disagreements,

279
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,950
but we couldn't agree.

280
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,214
That's a perfectly valid thing
to argue about.

281
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,881
That's got nothing to do with
any acrimony, if one person

282
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,153
wants it one way
and one wants it another way.

283
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,853
I mean, obviously, again,
I'd imagine

284
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,829
that's the reason they wanted
somebody else to come in.

285
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,527
To sort of shine a light
on what's gonna be the best way.

286
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:08,798
I think we'd just
run out of energy, you know?

287
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:12,535
And I remember going
to listen to the mix,

288
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,168
after he'd done a mix,
and it was a huge relief.

289
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:18,373
It was kind of unlike
how I would have mixed it,

290
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:22,350
much softer and more
kind of homogeneous,

291
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,479
but I think he did a great job.

292
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,199
For me, I mean,
several guitar parts

293
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,400
layered on top of each other.

294
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:49,206
Basic rhythm part, and then
some stuff on the pedal steel.

295
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,145
That would have been
the sort of basic guitar part,

296
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,874
done with
the whole band playing,

297
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,248
and then layering-on
of other instruments.

298
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,879
At least two tracks
on the pedal steel, I think.

299
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,925
Yeah, the first part's basically
just that one.

300
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,432
Then afterwards, there was one
I added on like this.

301
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,354
There's basically the same part,
at the beginning, anyway,

302
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,327
on Great Gig In The Sky.

303
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,714
There is no dark side
in the moon, really.

304
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,258
Matter of fact, it's all dark.

305
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:34,262
The only thing that
makes it look light is the sun.

306
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:36,923
There is no dark side
in the moon, really.

307
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,433
Matter of fact, it's all dark.

308
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:42,801
The only thing that
makes it look light is the sun.

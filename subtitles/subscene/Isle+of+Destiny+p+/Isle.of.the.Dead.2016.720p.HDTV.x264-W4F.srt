         to do, right?

  It's going to be okay.

152
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,843
         Any morphine?
              -No.

153
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,552
   The facility is that way.
     Probably a mile or so.

154
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,457
     We're going to have to
          keep moving.

155
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:09,260

  bring her with us.

156

You know that?

157
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,398
     Jerome and Pugh can go
           with you.

158
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,467
      I need to stay here
        and handle this.

159
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,002
      What are you doing?

160
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,139
I'm going to stay here so I can
position the GPS so I can light
      a fuse in this dump.

161
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,508
      We have to find that
       research facility.

162
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:25,210
  "We"? You're not a member of
       this team, Doctor.

163
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,011
   You're a piece of carry-on
            luggage.

164
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,147
  Listen, our primary mission
        hasn't changed.

165
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,882
          Yes it has.

166
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,485
   The minute that that freak
   took our Captain into the

167
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:34,953
jungle my mission became keeping
         my men alive.

168
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,957
   On<i> your mission</i> is to find
     whatever's left of the
          Alpha team.

169
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,892
That mission doesn't get tossed
   aside just because you saw
   something that scared you.

170
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,062
    So, what's it gonna be,
          Lieutenant?

171
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:46,197
     Are you gonna do what
      you came here to do?

172
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:48,032
 Or are you going to run away?

173
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:53,171
         Jerome. Pugh.

174
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,473
 Are you ready to finish this?

175

Sir. Yes, sir.

176

Lieutenant!

177

 -Look at me! Look at me!

    Dispatching the problem
     before it gets worse.

186
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,214
  She was dead the moment that
         thing bit her.

187
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,916
  Mikaela: You all know that.

          thanking me.

189

190
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,354
     You are not the leader
         of this team!

191
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,390
 Neither are you! Or else you'd
          act like it.

192
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,294
 You know as well as I do what
 was happening to her when she
         was becoming.

193
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:52,197
You should have done what I did
     the moment you saw it.

194
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,265
 But instead you put all of our
        lives in danger.

195
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:58,236
     You raise your gun at
      one of my men again,

196
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:03,174
     and the next bullet's
         going to go...

197
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,443
          right there.

           Hey, sir!

200

203
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:34,372
 The leader of the Alpha Team.

204
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,441
   Jerome: There's more here.

205
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,479

          as they got.

00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:51,456
          Sir, listen.
      We're waiting time.

210
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,358
We have to get to the facility.

211
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,094
 In this situation, anything we
  can find right now matters.

          We're ready.

300
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:36,460
Pugh: Guys, I think we're going
  to have a problem.

301
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:37,595
   Jerome: Yeah? What's that?

302
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,330
        The GPS tracker.

303
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,767
 Look, I may have lost it when
that undead bastard tackled me.

304
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,203
      I'm pretty sure it's
         still active.

305
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,205
Kurtis: So what are you saying?

306
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:51,475
That in eight hours, instead of
   a rescue chopper, we get--

307
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:52,810
             Nukes.

308
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:54,578
Can't we ping HQ, let them know
       we're still here?

309
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:56,781
        Zero tolerance.

310
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,084
If we don't disengage that GPS,
command is going to think we've
       been compromised.

311
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,088
 Government thinks the best way
   to handle a problem is to
         incinerate it.

312
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:08,092
  If it's ash, problem solved.

313
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,698
         See anything?

314
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,601
- Two.

315
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,703
             On 3.

316
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:21,372
            1, 2, 3!

317
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,146
         Drop the gun!

318
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,215
Do your weapon right now!
  -Down! Get down!

            My god.

323
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,267
    You look just like her.

324
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,306
Doc, what the hell is going on?

325
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,644
          He's my Dad.

326
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,150
       Come with me, now!

       Please, sit, sit.

 Please, I haven't had visitors
     in over a decade. Sit.

330
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,964
   Don't, don't, don't worry.

331

They are all securely locked up.
There's nothing to worry about.

332
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,936
         What are they?

333
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:02,072
          My patients.

334
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,043
        I found a cure.

335
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,479
             Cure?

336
00:24:09,182 --> 00:24:12,116
Wexler: Cure. Cure. Yeah, that's
       what I said, cure.

337
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:13,384
     You should be eating.

338
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,452
    Why are you not eating?

339
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:16,086
             Here.
             Here.

340
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:17,154
      You must be hungry.

341
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,956
             Here.

342
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,972
      She was a brilliant
     researcher, you know.

343
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,008
          Your mother.

344
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:44,915
    The work we did together
   at the NIH, it was really
        groundbreaking.

345
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:50,788
     Did she talk about me?

346
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,990
              Yes.

347
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,025
        Yes, at the end.

348
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:58,295
      You know by then she
         assumed that--

349
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,898
    Right. Yeah, of course.

350
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:06,937
I, I want you to know that I did
 ask her to come with me to the
        facility. I did.

351
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:14,011
She said she just
 If I had her help... the
   sequencing...

352
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,513
But that...no.

353
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:17,848
I mean, if this is speculation.

354
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,820
Water under the bridge. You know
   bridges burn.

355
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,455
          You're here!

356
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,491
          You're here!

357
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,293
           This um...

358
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:33,264
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

359
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,766
           It's not.

360
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:39,136
I thought this might be my only
chance to get to know your work.

361
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,374
   I've never considered the
          possibility--

362
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,278
      I know. I was alive.

363
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,450
      Mikaela, I'm sorry.

364
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,154
Colonel, why didn't you contact
              HQ?

365
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,456
      Let them know you're
          still alive.

366
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,159
       What's the point?

367
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,929
I mean ,

368
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:08,299
  The estimated mortality rate
          was totaled.

369
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,902
   I was considered collateral
            damage.

370
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,205
The minute the pathogen escaped
           the lab...

371
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:18,075
  They weren't coming for me.

372
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,278
    They weren't coming for
           any of us.

373
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:29,520
But , that is the point
 of a ten year quarantine.

374
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:31,755
         Isn't it, huh?

375
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,926
 Yeah. You let the epidemic run
          its course,

376
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,128
    to kill a possible host.

377
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,797
      Starve it to death.

378
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,932
   That's why we picked this
       island, in fact--

379
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:45,436
It's a natural limit to how far
         it can spread.

380
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:51,141
Yeah, but what about, birds and
     fish? And other stuff?

381
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:55,312
  Has there been a case of an
   outbreak in the mainland?

382
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,214
              No.

383
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,085
 Then I guess that birds, fish,
  and stuff are not a problem.

384
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,888
    What exactly went wrong,
            Colonel?

385
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:11,895
   The order was to create a
 weaponized strain of the Ebola
             virus.

386
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,101
  And you know, when the army
  embarks on such an endeavor,

387
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,136
   We split the work into two
            tracks.

388
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:22,272
 Refining the pathogen to make
         the bioweapon,

389
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:26,176
 and synthesizing an anti-serum
         to defeat it.

390
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:27,578
              Why?

391
00:27:27,713 --> 00:27:30,814
 Why do you have the safety on
       your gun, soldier?

392
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,484
So you don't kill yourself with
        it accidentally.

393
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,355
 What we saw out there in that
   jungle, that wasn't Ebola.

394
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:41,725
        No. Not anymore.

395
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:45,896
The head of my bioweapons teamis
   also my second in-command,
       Captain Marshall.

396
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:52,903
   Marshall, he created some
 mutated strains of the virus.

397
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,173
      See, he was sloppy.
            Sloppy.

398
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,242
  He didn't follow protocols.

399
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,745
Why have protocols if you're not
     going to follow them!

400
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:07,084
 So one of his strains was very
          aggressive,

401
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,220
    its effects were beyond
something that we could control.

402
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:15,125
 And so when infected, then it
became what you saw out there in
          the jungle.

403
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:22,399
      Those dead, rotting,
  flesh-hungry animals. Devoid
 of any human characteristics.

404
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:25,536
    What Marshall created...

405
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:33,911
   just wiped the soul out of
     everyone it infected.

406
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,284
      I was overseeing the
       anti-serum teams.

407
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:48,325
 We were progressing on a cure.
   A virus that would keep at
   bay, but it was too slow.

408
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:51,328
   This is why if I had your
  mother. This is why it would

409
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,430
      have been okay. This
         was her forte.

410
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:56,066
And the minute that it left the
     lab we were all caught
          flat-footed.

411
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,802
 I was lucky to have survived.

412
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,739
 Too bad you can't say the same
         for your men.

413
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,807
  How did the pathogen escape?

414
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,813
What are you implying, soldier?

415
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,786
    I have been running this
   facility by myself for ten
             years.

416
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:19,757
 I have protocols. I don't need
        your questions.

417
00:29:20,826 --> 00:29:23,460
 Okay. You don't have to answer
         my questions,

418
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,830
 but I don't think HQ is going
    to be quite so patient.

419
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,770
Oh you think that you could...

420
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,976
    Gibson: What's so funny?

421
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,216
    I'm not going anywhere.

422
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:55,492
    The work that I've been
      doing here is far to
     important to abandon.

423
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,532
Your "work" ended ten years ago.

424
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,500
   My initial research, yes.

425
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:10,908
But what I have been working on
since the incident, Mikaela, it
      is very interesting.

426
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,844
 So you've been continuing your
           research?

427
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
       We're scientists.

428
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,549
         Wouldn't you?

429
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,089
  I said, I discovered a cure.

430
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,291
           For what?

431
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,059
           For death.

432
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:37,801
      Do you want to see?

433
00:30:41,574 --> 00:30:44,808
                               ♪

434
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:58,255
     This is patient 9166.

435
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,459
     She had been infected
   nearly seven years by the
       time I found her.

436
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:06,230
    With the pathogen having
 affected nearly every organism
         on the island.

437
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,266
Coupled with a mortality rate of
  nearly one hundred percent,

438
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,904
finding a cure for the virus was
          challenging.

439
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,344
 I had to find a way to reverse
  the effects of the virus. At
 least to slow its progression.

440
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:24,848
   And it was during my lab,
      Myopia, we call it.

441
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,588
     I discovered it had an
 amazing effect on human death.

442
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,998
  You can see, the effects are
       just fascinating.

443
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,033
    You're experimenting on
        your own people.

444
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,169
  No, no, no, no. Not people,
 Lieutenant. They are cadavers.

445
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:50,340
   They're just a little more
           animated.

446
00:31:51,277 --> 00:31:56,280
 So after all the tests and all
the death, your research hasn't
     yielded any progress.

447
00:31:56,548 --> 00:32:00,350
     There are many ways to
  gauge progress, Lieutenant.

448
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:06,523
 And, my theory is that I have
   made remarkable strides in
        modern medicine.

There is no true way to reverse

 But you can keep it in check.
    If you catch it on time,

515
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:56,786
there's an eighty-six-point-five
percent chance of arresting the
         virus spread.

516
00:35:56,922 --> 00:36:00,223
   Of the thirteen and a half
percent left, most will succumb
          to the virus

517
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:04,161
  and then you just dispose of
     them by destroying the
         hypothalamus.

 display an anomalous reaction.

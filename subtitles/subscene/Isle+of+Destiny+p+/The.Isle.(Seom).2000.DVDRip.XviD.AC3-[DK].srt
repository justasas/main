1
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,680
Damn! Give me a pack
of 4 inch love-tailed worms.

2
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,480
Ouch! Shit!

3
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,200
THE ISLE

4
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,280
Hey, 3 cups of coffee.

5
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,960
Come on up. We're gonna need
something more than just coffee.

6
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
Let's see it.

7
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,400
You first.

8
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,600
- No, you first.
- No! You first.

9
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,600
Damn. I'm out.

10
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Hey you, come on in.

11
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,040
- You're out.
- Bastard.

12
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Come on, let's have those cards.

13
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,360
Hey, you're not going to do it?

14
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't want to.

15
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,280
What, you think it's dirty?

16
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Just pay up and let her leave.

17
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh, really?

18
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,520
You won, so you pay.

19
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,480
I didn't win much, you bastard!

20
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,840
Shit, it's only fuck money.
Just pay her.

21
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,240
Cheap assholes.

22
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,880
Say something and I'll give you
the money, okay?

23
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,320
Come on. You moan,
I know you can talk.

24
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,960
Stop teasing and let her go.

25
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Bastard.

26
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,320
I'm gonna pay!
Hey, say something.

27
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,480
I can't just give it to you.
You have to say something.

28
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,600
Here. Here.
Shit!

29
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,920
Let's have them.

30
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
You're such a fucker.

31
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,600
It's me. Put Hae-Mi on.

32
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,280
Then wake her up.

33
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,360
Hae-Mi, it's Dad. What did you
learn at kindergarten today?

34
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,320
How to make a kite?

35
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,200
Help!

36
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,080
What?

37
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,920
Help!

38
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,760
Come here, you dumbass.

39
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,760
Help!

40
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Here, grab it.

41
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
Wait a second.

42
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
Hold on!

43
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,120
Hurry up!

44
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,080
The light green float.

45
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,480
- This boat is ancient.
- It probably leaks, huh?

46
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,000
- Will they pay double?
- They should.

47
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,480
- Stop messing around.
- What?

48
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,800
What took you so long?

49
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,360
Be glad we even came this far.

50
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,800
That's why we pay you double.

51
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,080
Thank you.

52
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,160
She's so rude.

53
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,040
They're the size of your thing.

54
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey, have you seen mine?

55
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,720
I can tell.

56
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,640
If it's bigger than this,
I'm not letting you go today.

57
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,800
- Whatever.
- Come here.

58
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,240
What's the rush.

59
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,320
Coffee first.
My shoes, my shoes.

60
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,840
Wait, is there a restroom here?

61
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,480
He's nuts. It's raining like hell,
and he wants a fuck.

62
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,840
Hey, asshole. It's raining
like this and you want to fuck?

63
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,440
I feel like shit,
so let's hurry up.

64
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,720
Hey, put your clothes on.

65
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,640
What?

66
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
One more sugar.

67
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,080
Sugar's bad for you.

68
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,880
Pay up, I have to go.
You have to pay me for the trip.

69
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,680
Where's the boat?
Bring the boat. Hey, you!

70
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,280
Hey!

71
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,360
Come inside.
It's raining.

72
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Hey!

73
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,440
What'll you do? You have to
pay me double the double now.

74
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,600
Know how many clients I have?
Fuck, I have to pee.

75
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,200
I can't go here!

76
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,680
Shit, don't look.
You'll pay up, right?

77
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,120
That's a relief.

78
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,560
What are you making?
Oh, it's a bicycle.

79
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,400
Can you fix this?
It's too loose.

80
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,520
Let me try.

81
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,880
It looks so real.
Can I have it?

82
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:13,160
You must be nice if you can
make a pretty thing like this.

83
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,960
Stop swearing.
It doesn't suit you.

84
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,680
You too. Right, it's not me.

85
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,840
I know she's here. Who the fuck
is keeping her for hours?

86
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:40,560
Can I hug you?
I'm attracted to quiet men.

87
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,080
Fuckers! Come out, you fuck!
Come out before...!

88
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,680
He didn't do anything wrong!

89
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,040
Come here, you bitch!
Nothing's wrong here? Fuckers!

90
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,760
Son of a bitch! You know
how much this costs? Asshole!

91
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,800
Did you get paid?

92
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,680
Hurry up, bitch!
Fuck! Get in.

93
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,480
Let's go.
Motherfucker!

94
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,080
Ugly-ass motherfucker!

95
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,480
I'll be here a month. Let's get to
know each other better.

96
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,280
What color do you like?

97
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
Me?

98
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,960
Green.

99
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,480
Take us to the green float.

100
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,880
Catch anything?

101
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,280
I got something!

102
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,120
- Damn, it's a big one.
- Look at it go!

103
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,480
It's strong like you.

104
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,200
We should make Sashimi
out of this right away.

105
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,600
You can do that?

106
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,840
Why not?

107
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,880
Try it.

108
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,880
It's good, huh?

109
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,680
Better than I thought.

110
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,560
Take a look at this.

111
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,480
Wow, that's cool!

112
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,480
It's incredible!

113
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,280
Have some.

114
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,880
Now?

115
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,080
I came to see you because
it's my day off.

116
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,120
What are you looking at?

117
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
What's wrong?

118
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm no whore. I came to see you
because I wanted to, not for work.

119
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,120
You're mean.

120
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,680
This is for someone else.

121
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,120
Don't forget to drink the juice.
I'll be back.

122
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,120
Bye.

123
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,760
See you later.

124
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,320
Thank you for helping my friend.

125
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,680
Ouch! Shit!

126
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,760
What?

127
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,640
Okay, slowly now...

128
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,520
Excuse us, we need to
do an inspection.

129
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,280
I'm sorry, but could we
see some ID?

130
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,240
Yes.

131
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:16,960
Let's see it.

132
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,720
But I don't have any.

133
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,080
Then you'll have to
come with us.

134
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,360
Fuck, we lost him.

135
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,600
Look, over there.

136
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:43,680
Is he dead?

137
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,920
- I don't know. Wait.
- Alright.

138
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,840
Okay, okay.

139
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,960
- Grab...
- Grab him.

140
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:17,160
No, the bastard.
This fucker...

141
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,880
What are you doing?
Take me to the yellow float.

142
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,240
Where are we going?
The yellow float is over there.

143
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,000
This isn't it.

144
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,040
Where are those fuckers?

145
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,680
Where is that ugly-ass?

146
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,920
Bring the boat.

147
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:15,640
God damn it!

148
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,040
Where is she?

149
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,880
Asshole.

150
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,000
What the...?

151
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:47,240
Hey, anybody there?

152
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,600
Aren't you open for business?

153
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,000
Damn it.

154
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:41,040
Go away.

155
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,880
Get the fuck away from me!

156
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,800
What are you, crazy?

157
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:32,040
I'm not your man. I can leave
whenever I want to, you whore!

158
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,120
What color do you like?

159
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:21,040
Me?

160
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:23,880
Purple.

161
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:26,680
Purple?
That's too far.

162
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,520
The farther the better.
Let's go.

163
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,920
- Okay, let's go to the purple one.
- Get in.

164
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,320
Was it good?

165
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:15,720
Yeah, of course.

166
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,040
Got one!

167
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,880
It's so alive.

168
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:55,760
Oh, shit.

169
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,280
Do you have any idea
how much that costs?

170
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,000
Operator! Operator!
Get me the local divers.

171
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:45,480
- What? It's a scooter.
- What's it doing here?

172
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,120
What?

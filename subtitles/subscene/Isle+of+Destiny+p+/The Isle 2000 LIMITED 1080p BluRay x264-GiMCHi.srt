00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:39,715

- You're out
- Bastard...

28
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,814
Come on, let's have those cards

29
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,409
Hey, you're not gonna do it?

30
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,993
I don't want to

31
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,413
What, you think it's dirty?

32
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,041
Just pay up and let her leave

33
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,628
Oh, really
You won, so you pay

34
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,422
I barely won, you bastard!

35
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:06,301
Ah, shit, it's only fuck money.
Just pay her.

36
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,263
Cheap assholes...

37
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:15,018
Hey, say something, then I'll give
you the money, OK?

00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,938
Come on, you moan.
I know you can talk.

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,693
Oh, stop teasing and let her go

40
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:29,074
Bastard... I'm gonna pay!
Hey, say something.

41
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:34,413
I can't just give it to you. You
have to say something, come on...

42
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:38,083
Here, here... Shit!

43
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:45,466
- Let's have them
- You're such a fucker

44
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,678
- We have to catch something
- I'm starving...

45
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:15,722
Oh, it's me.

46
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,933
Put Hae-Mi on.

47
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,354
Then wake her up...

48
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:31,488
Oh, Hae-Mi, it's Dad. What did you
learn at kindergarten today?

49
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,242
Making a kite?

50
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:42,207
- Help!
- What?

51
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:47,087
Help!!

52
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,887
- Come here, you dumbass
- Help!!!

53
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,765
Here, here... Grab it

54
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,836
Wait a second...

55
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,364
Hold on!

56
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,875
Hurry up

57
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,639
The light-green float

58
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,770
- This boat is ancient
- It probably leaks, huh?

59
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:20,655
- Will they pay double?
- They should

60
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,292
- Stop messing around
- What?

61
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,421
What took you so long

62
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,299
Be glad that we even came this far

63
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,801
That's why we pay you double

64
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:47,682
Thank you
She's so rude

65
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:52,437
They're the size of your thing

66
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:55,148
Hey, you saw mine?

67
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:56,941
I can tell

68
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,695
If it's bigger than this, I'm not
gonna let you go today

69
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:04,198
- Come here
- What's the rush? Coffee first...

70
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:07,952
Ah, my shoes, my shoes...

71
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:21,776
Wait, is there a restroom here?

72
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:37,151
He's nuts. It's raining like hell, and
he wants a fuck.

73
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:23,656
Hey, you asshole. It's raining like
this and you want to fuck?

74
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,039
I feel like shit, so let's hurry up

75
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,587
- Hey, put your clothes on
- What??

76
00:30:55,813 --> 00:31:01,318
- One more sugar
- Sugar's bad for you...

77
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:13,455
Pay up, I have to go.
You have to pay me for the trip.

78
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:28,387
What, where's the boat, hey!
Bring the boat... Hey you!

79
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:37,521
Hey!

80
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,279
What are you gonna do?

81
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,867
You have to pay me double the double now.
Do you know how many customers I have?

82
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:59,543
Fuck, I have to pee...

83
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:06,050
I can't go here!

84
00:32:14,892 --> 00:32:23,525
Shit, don't look.
You'll pay up, right?

85
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,905
Ooh, that's a relief

86
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:35,079
What are you making?
Oh, it's a bicycle.

87
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,463
Hey, can you fix this?
It's too loose.

88
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,996
Let me try

89
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:26,088
Oh, it's looks so real.
Can I have it?

90
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:35,973
You seem like a nice guy since you
can make a pretty thing like this.

91
00:33:35,973 --> 00:33:39,727
Stop cursing, it doesn't suit you

92
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:46,483
Oh, you say it, too.
Right, it's not me.

93
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:54,366
I know she's here. Who the fuck is
holding her for hours?...

94
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,871
Can I hug you?

95
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:05,294
I'm attracted to men who are quiet.

96
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:30,069
Fuckers... Come out you fuck,
come out before...

97
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:36,241
- He didn't do anything wrong!
- Come here, you bitch! Nothing's wrong here??

98
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,870
You sonuvabitch, you know how
much this costs? You asshole!

99
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:46,877
Hey, did you get paid?
Hurry up, bitch! Fuck, Get <i>on...</i>

100
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:54,885
Let's go...
Motherfucker! An ugly-ass motherfucker!

101
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:11,211
I'll be here for a month.
Let's get to know each other.

102
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:06,767
- What color do you like?
- Me? Green

103
00:37:08,227 --> 00:37:10,854
Take us to the green float

104
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:08,829
Catch some?

105
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,584
- Got it!
- Wow

106
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:24,720
- Damn, it's a big one
- Look at it go!

107
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:29,599
It's strong like you

108
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:36,565
You know, we should make sushi
out of this right away

109
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:45,615
- You can do that?
- Why not?

110
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:51,747
Try it

111
00:38:51,955 --> 00:38:55,250
- It's good, huh?
- Better than I thought

112
00:38:58,128 --> 00:39:03,759
Take a look at this

113
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:11,350
Wow, that's neat
Oh, it's incredible!

114
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,519
Have some

115
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,031
Now?

116
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:25,090
I came to see you because it's
my day off

117
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:31,680
What are you looking at?

118
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,973
What's wrong?

119
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:26,526
I'm not a whore. I came to see you
because I wanted to, not for work.

120
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,284
You're mean

121
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:42,417
This is for someone else

122
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:51,009
Don't forget to drink the juice.
I'll be back.

123
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:56,014
Bye

124
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:04,439
See you later...

125
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:14,824
Thank you for helping my friend

126
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,957
Ah, ouch... Shit!

127
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:44,688
What??

128
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:23,286
OK, slowly now...

129
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:55,193
Excuse us, we need to make an
inspection

130
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:05,203
I'm sorry but could we see some ID?

131
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:08,248
- Yes...
- Let's see it

132
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,375
But... I don't have one

133
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:21,136
Then you'll have to come with us

134
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:23,847
You OK?

135
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,271
Fuck, we lost him

136
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,024
- Look over there
- Is he dead?

137
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,277
- Don't know... Wait
- Right

138
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:05,930
- OK, OK...
- Grab... Grab him

139
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:10,435
No, this bastard... this fucker...
Dare stab a police officer? You shit!

140
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:04,242
What are you doing?
Take me to the yellow float.

141
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:21,485
Where are we going?
The yellow float is over there.

142
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,373
This is not it...

143
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:45,137
Hey, where are those fuckers?
Where is that ugly-ass?

144
01:02:45,429 --> 01:02:50,559
Bring the boat
God damn it!

145
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:34,228
Where is she? Asshole...

146
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:12,266
What the...?!

147
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:38,537
Hey, anybody there?
Aren't you open for business?

148
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:29,731
Go away

149
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,242
Get the fuck away from me!

150
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:12,274
What are you, crazy?

151
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:20,282
I'm not your man. I can leave
whenever I want to, you whore!

152
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:41,963
- What color do you like?
- Me? Uh, purple!

153
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:49,220
- Purple? That's too far.
- Farther the better. Let's go.

154
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:54,225
- OK, let's go to the purple one
- Get on...

155
01:21:33,264 --> 01:21:36,893
- Was it good?
- Yeah, of course

156
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:04,921
- Got it
- Wow

157
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:11,302
Man, oh Wow

158
01:22:12,303 --> 01:22:16,307
It's so alive

159
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:22,271
Oh, shit
Do you any idea how much that costs?

160
01:22:29,946 --> 01:22:35,826
Operator, operator! Get me the local
divers.

161
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:10,361
- What, it's a scooter
- What's it doing here?

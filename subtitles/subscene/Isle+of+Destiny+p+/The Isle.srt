00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,420
I don't want to.

16
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,030

24
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,990

I know you can talk.

25
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,290
oh, stop teasing and let her go.

26
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,430

27
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,370

oh, hai-mi, it's dad.

35
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,590
what did you learn
at kindergarten today?

36
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,590
...making a kite?

37
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,930

38
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,860

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,270
wait a second...

44
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,380
hold on!

45
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,260
hurry up.

46
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,840
the light-green float.

47
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,010
- this boat is ancient
- It probably leaks, huh?

48
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,870
- will they pay double?
- they should.

49
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,580
- stop messing around.
- what?

50
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,250
what took you so long?

51
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,050
Be glad that we even came this far.

52
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,450
that's why we pay you double.

53
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,020
thank you.

54
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,460
she's so rude.

55
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,130
they're the size of your thing.

56
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,400
hey, you saw mine?

57
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,700
I can tell.

58
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,700
If it's bigger than this,
I'm not gonna let you go today.

59
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,100
- whatever...
- come here.

60
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,370
what's the rush?

61
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:06,350
coffee first...
ah, my shoes, my shoes...

62
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,880

63
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,990
he's nuts. It's raining like hell,
and he wants a fuck.

64
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,430
hey, you asshole.

65
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,300
It's raining like this
and you want to fuck?

66
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,950
I feel like shit, so let's hurry up.

67
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,920

68
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,920

69
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,000
one more sugar.

70
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,950
sugar's bad for you...

71
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,980
pay up, I have to go.

72
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:26,060

Bring the boat...hey you!

73
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,930

75
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,610
hey!

76
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,860
what are you gonna do? you have
to pay me double the double now.

77
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,360
do you know how many
customers I have?...

78
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,600
Fuck, I have to pee...

79
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,000
I gotta go...

80
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,470
I can't go here!

81
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,550
shit, don't look.

82
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,090
you'll pay up, right?

83
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,000
ooh, that's a relief.

84
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,000
what are you making?

85
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,260
oh, it's a bicycle.

86
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,440
hey, can you fix this?

87
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,810
It's too loose.

88
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,980
let me try.

89
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,580
oh, it looks so real.

90
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,520
can I have it?

91
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,690
you seem like a nice guy since you
can make a pretty thing like this.

92
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,430
stop cursing, it doesn't suit you.

93
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,310
oh, you say it, too.
right, it's not me.

94
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,620
I know she's here. who the fuck is
holding her for hours?...

95
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,350
can I hug you?

96
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,160
I'm attracted to men who are quiet.

97
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:29,580
Fuckers...come out you fuck,
come out before...

98
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,280

99
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,690
come here, you bitch! Nothing's
wrong here? Fuckers...

100
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,860

much this costs? you asshole!

101
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,900

102
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,960

104
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,640
an ugly-ass motherfucker!

105
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:09,850
I'll be here for a month.
let's get to know each other.

106
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,340
what color do you like?

107
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,880
me?

108
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,540
green.

109
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,810
take us to the green float.

110
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,830
catch some?

111
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,040
- get it!
- wow.

112
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,710
- damn, it's a big one.
- look at it, go!

113
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,490
It's strong like you.

114
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,400
you know, we should make sashimi
out of this right away.

115
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,630
you can do that?

116
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,680
why not?

117
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,940
try it.

118
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,650
It's good, huh?

119
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,380
Better than I thought.

120
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,560
take a look at this.

121
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,670
wow, that's neat.

122
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,470
oh, it's incredible!

123
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,030
have some.

124
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,020
Now?

125
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,800
I came to see you because it's
my day off.

126
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,580
what are you looking at?

127
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,050
what's wrong?

128
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,190
I'm not a whore.

129
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,300
I came to see you
because I wanted to, not for work.

130
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,000
you're mean.

131
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:40,650
this is for someone else.

132
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,630
don't forget to drink the juice.
I'll be back.

133
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,590
Bye.

134
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,670
see you later...

135
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,140
thank you for helping my friend.

136
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,160
ah, ouch...shit!

137
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,710

138
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:21,050
ok, slowly now...

139
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,250
Excuse us, we need to make
an inspection.

140
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,620
I'm sorry but could we see some Id?

141
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,120
yes...

142
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,760
let's see it.

143
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,230
But...I don't have one.

144
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,060
then you'll have to come with us.

145
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:30,310
Fuck, we lost him.

146
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,790
- look over here.
- Is he dead?

147
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,080
- don't know... wait

148
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,480
ok, ok...

149
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,610
- grab...
- grab him.

150
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,190
No, this bastard...this fucker...

151
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,720

...you shit!

152
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,520
what are you doing?
take me to the yellow float.

153
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:20,770
where are we going?
the yellow float is over there.

154
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,150
this is not it...

155
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:43,950
hey, where are those fuckers?
where is that ugly-ass?

156
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,820
Bring the boat.

157
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:49,790
god damn it!

158
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:29,790

159
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,900
asshole...

160
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,160

161
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,170
hey, anybody there?

162
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,580
aren't you open for business?

163
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,510
damn it.

164
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,830

165
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,170

166
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,560
what are you, crazy?

167
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:17,570
I'm not your man.

168
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:22,080
I can leave whenever I want to,
you whore!

169
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,550
what color do you like?

170
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:39,090

171
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,120
uh, purple.

172
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:44,690
purple? that's too far.

173
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,730
Farther the better. let's go.

174
01:20:48,970 --> 01:20:51,460
- ok, let's go to the purple one.
- get on...

175
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,110

176
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,840
yeah, of course.

177
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:02,370

oh, shit.

181
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,190

182
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:34,660
operator, operator!

183
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:09,900

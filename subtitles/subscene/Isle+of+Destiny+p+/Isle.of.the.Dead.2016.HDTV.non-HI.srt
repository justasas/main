1
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,182
This place is on lock-down!

2
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,957
What's the containment level?

3
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,492
Containment?
There is no containment!

4
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:05,094
- What about the barracks?
- Breached!

5
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:06,962
- The armory?
- Breached!

6
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,930
What about my lab?

7
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,633
Lab? That's how this whole cluster
started! You and your experiments!

8
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:14,036
Damn it, I have to get to the lab!

9
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:19,708
Now, Captain!

10
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,942
Yes, sir!

11
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,100
Security protocol. Aidan Wexler.

12
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:47,436
We need a new evacuation plan.

13
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:49,871
We're not leaving this place.
We're fixing it.

14
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:52,907
This facility was entrusted to me.
Everything I have built is here.

15
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,310
I am not going to run away.

16
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:58,447
You can go down with the ship
if you want to, Colonel.

17
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,183
I didn't sign up to be
one of your guinea pigs.

18
00:03:01,216 --> 00:03:03,118
Neither did my men.

19
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:06,988
As far as I'm concerned, you can rot
here with the rest of your pets.

20
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:12,927
But if you ask me nicely, maybe I'll
do you a favor, and end you here.

21
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,196
You're pathetic.

22
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:15,630
If you were any kind of leader,

23
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,865
you and your men
would have held this facility.

24
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:20,135
That was your job. You failed.

25
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:29,010
Help me!

26
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:30,705
Air's clean. We're good.

27
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:34,075
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, we're in the green.

28
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:36,545
LZ is clear.

29
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:39,381
Just over that ridge,
it turns into jungle fast.

30
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:41,350
Sat imagery didn't pick up
any heat signatures,

31
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,285
that doesn't mean
the trees aren't crawling

32
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:44,653
with those skin puppet bastards.

33
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,721
Eyes open all the time.
Understood?

34
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:47,989
Sir! Yes, sir!

35
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,424
Remember mission objectives.

36
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,026
One, find and locate
any Alpha Team survivors.

37
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,595
Two, get the hell out alive.

38
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:56,265
Yeah. And three, kill a ton of deadies.

39
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,967
You think this is a video game, Pugh?

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,637
Whatever's on this island took Alpha
Team offline in less than an hour.

41
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:05,207
They were a hell of
a lot tougher than you!

42
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,514
Our single advantage is, we have some
idea of what we're walking into.

43
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,283
This may be the one day in your life

44
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,785
you get to be
smarter than someone, Pugh.

45
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,153
Try not to screw it up.

46
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:19,288
Understood?

47
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,322
Sir. Yes, sir.

48
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:21,556
That thing working?

49
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:27,529
100%.

50
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,864
Good. Set it for 10 hours on my mark.

51
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:31,400
Ready? Mark.

52
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:33,602
What's that?

53
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:34,669
Safety net.

54
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:35,670
GPS beacon.

55
00:05:35,704 --> 00:05:37,339
Five hundred miles east of here,

56
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,040
there's an Ohio-class sub
listening to that box.

57
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,876
We don't hit the snooze on
that sucker within 10 hours,

58
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,645
our friends under the sea will surmise

59
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:45,480
this island is beyond reclamation

60
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:49,351
and nuke the almighty crap out of it.

61
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:51,220
So, assuming we get
out of here as planned,

62
00:05:51,253 --> 00:05:53,822
one of us needs to remember to
turn the lights out before we go.

63
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,290
You hear that, Gibson?

64
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,958
Loud and clear, sir.

65
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:59,228
This island holds significant
scientific importance.

66
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,662
You don't get to just destroy it.

67
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,631
All due respect, mademoiselle,

68
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:04,766
I don't know how
the French government works,

69
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,701
but the US government made this island.

70
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:09,671
They want to unmake it,
that's their call.

71
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:12,407
We're on this godforsaken
island for exactly 10 hours.

72
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:17,111
When that chopper comes back, I
expect every one of you to be on it.

73
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,247
You read me?

74
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,282
Sir! Yes, sir!

75
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,284
Make sure your personal beacons are on.

76
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,552
Don't want anyone getting lost.

77
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:25,654
Good.

78
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:27,556
- Duggan, you're on point.
- Copy that.

79
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:29,524
Doc, you're with me and Gibson.

80
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:33,462
Pugh, try not to trip over your own
dick. Jerome, you got rear.

81
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:51,746
Sir, do you hear that?

82
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,715
I don't hear anything.
Exactly.

83
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,718
We've been to 100 of these places.

84
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,887
They always sound like a freaking zoo.

85
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,921
I don't like it.

86
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:01,723
You and me, both.

87
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:05,560
Meant what I said, Gibson. We're
all getting off this island.

88
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:08,430
- The facility is that way.
- Much obliged.

89
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:11,366
Sir. Right there. One bogey.

90
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,738
Just as advertised.

91
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,443
Wonder how many more are around.

92
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,754
That thing moves half an
inch towards us, it's toast.

93
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,375
There's more of them!

94
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:55,644
To the left!

95
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:59,648
Fall in! Fall in! Fall in!

96
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:01,683
I got the six. Fall in! Fall in!

97
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,886
- Move! Move! Move!
- Fall in!

98
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,988
- Fall in! Fall in!
- Go! Go! Go!

99
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,525
To the west! To the west!

100
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:34,115
Did overall just do that?

101
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,075
Pugh, take care of Duggan.

102
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:03,244
I think that's the last of them for now.

103
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:04,513
Gibson! Med kit!

104
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,014
What happened?

105
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,282
The whole island's swarming with them!

106
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:10,619
It's going to be okay.

107
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:14,989
Sir, you know what you have to do.

108
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:18,259
Not now, Doc.
She's one of my own.

109
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,394
You fix her up best you can.

110
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,729
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:22,697
We gotta keep moving. Eyes on the prize.

112
00:09:22,731 --> 00:09:24,466
"Eyes on the prize"?

113
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,334
I don't know what just happened,
or what these things are,

114
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,302
but we are not prepared!

115
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:31,706
You are a Navy SEAL, son. You are
prepared for anything and everything.

116
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:34,543
You hear me?

117
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,278
Good.

118
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,048
Captain!

119
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:41,215
Jerome. Gibson. Take the west flank.

120
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,651
I got the east.
Sir!

121
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,557
I got you, all right? I got you.

122
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,428
You know she's dead, right?

123
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,152
Captain!

124
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:19,721
Gibson, over here!

125
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,824
I fixed her up the best I could.

126
00:10:23,892 --> 00:10:25,594
Captain!

127
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:26,995
Where is he, Pugh?

128
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:29,397
Where is he?

129
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,632
Uh...

130
00:10:31,265 --> 00:10:32,901
That way.

131
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:33,902
We gotta move.

132
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:37,105
Let's move! Let's move! Come on!

133
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,439
Let's go!

134
00:10:58,993 --> 00:11:00,795
Yes.

135
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:03,464
Listen, if you're going
to insist on bringing her,

136
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:05,133
you might want to shut her up.

137
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,101
She's gonna draw attention.

138
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:12,140
Let her rest.

139
00:11:12,173 --> 00:11:13,174
Here.

140
00:11:15,744 --> 00:11:18,379
Sit her down.

141
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:20,815
There you go. There you go.

142
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,353
Bite on this for me, okay?

143
00:11:25,386 --> 00:11:28,557
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

144
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,958
It's going to be okay, all right?

145
00:11:29,991 --> 00:11:31,826
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

146
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,194
It's going to be okay.

147
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:41,502
You know what you have to do, right?

148
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,210
You're going to be okay.
You're going to be okay.

149
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:50,579
Got any morphine?

150
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:52,313
No.

151
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,982
It's gonna be okay, all right?
It's gonna be okay.

152
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:01,590
The facility is that way,
probably a mile or so.

153
00:12:01,623 --> 00:12:04,125
You're okay.

154
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:06,327
We're going to have to keep moving.

155
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,764
And you cannot bring her with us.

156
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:11,700
You know that.

157
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,735
Jerome and Pugh can go with you.

158
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:15,737
I need to stay here and handle this.

159
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,138
What are you doing?

160
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:19,140
I'm going to stay here
and position the GPS,

161
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,675
so I can light a fuse in this dump.

162
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,943
We have to find that research facility.

163
00:12:21,976 --> 00:12:23,111
"We"?

164
00:12:23,144 --> 00:12:25,513
You're not a member
of this team, Doctor.

165
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,015
You're a piece of carry-on luggage.

166
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,350
Listen, our primary mission
hasn't changed.

167
00:12:29,383 --> 00:12:32,921
Yes, it has. The minute that that freak
took our Captain into the jungle,

168
00:12:32,954 --> 00:12:34,756
my mission became keeping my men alive.

169
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,158
No, your mission is to find
whatever's left of the Alpha Team.

170
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,993
That mission doesn't get tossed aside

171
00:12:39,027 --> 00:12:41,562
just because you saw something
that scared you.

172
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,932
So, what's it gonna be, Lieutenant?

173
00:12:43,965 --> 00:12:48,002
Are you gonna do what you came here
to do? Or are you going to run away?

174
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:53,041
Jerome! Pugh!

175
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,810
Are you ready to finish this?

176
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:57,578
Sir. Yes, sir.

177
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,247
Lieutenant!

178
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,649
Come on, come on!

179
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:01,783
It's all right! It's all right!
Just look at me.

180
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:02,917
It's gonna be all right.

181
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:03,985
Look at me! Look at me!
Duggan!

182
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,354
She's turning! She's turning.

183
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,289
Come on. Come on.
Look at me. Look at me!

184
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:09,858
You'll be fine, Duggan.

185
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:11,292
- She's turning!
- It's going to be all right.

186
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,493
Look at me! Look at me!

187
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,495
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

188
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,397
It's all right.

189
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,067
Keep fighting, Duggan.
Keep fighting! Keep fighting, Duggan.

190
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,336
It's gonna be all right, Duggan.

191
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,672
What the...

192
00:13:25,774 --> 00:13:28,176
You killed her!
What was that?

193
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:32,013
Dispatching the problem
before it gets worse.

194
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:38,152
She was dead the moment that thing
bit her. You all know that.

195
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:40,354
If anything, you should be thanking me.

196
00:13:40,388 --> 00:13:43,825
That was not your call! You are
not the leader of this team!

197
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,960
Neither are you!
Or else, you'd act like it.

198
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,428
You know as well as I do,

199
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,297
what was happening to her,
what she was becoming.

200
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,233
You should have done what I
did the moment you saw it,

201
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,804
but instead, you put all
of our lives in danger.

202
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:57,772
You raise your gun at
one of my men again,

203
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:02,010
and the next bullet's going to go

204
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:05,780
right there.

205
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:09,317
Are you done?

206
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,428
Hey, uh, sir? I think you're
gonna wanna see this.

207
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:24,065
What?

208
00:14:30,438 --> 00:14:31,740
Who's Murphy?

209
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,176
The leader of Alpha Team.

210
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,845
There's more over here.

211
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,050
This must be as far as they got.

212
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,019
Dug in and emptied the whole thing out.

213
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:49,057
It doesn't make any sense.
Search the area.

214
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,926
Sir, listen. We're wasting time.

215
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,494
We have to get to that facility.

216
00:14:53,527 --> 00:14:56,564
In this situation, anything we
can find right now matters.

217
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:59,901
Whatever Alpha Team had in
that box did not help them.

218
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:02,871
What makes you think
it's going to help us?

219
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:06,941
I'm an optimist.

220
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:11,880
Davy Crockett?

221
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,884
Hey, Gibson!

222
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:18,386
Davy Crockett!

223
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:19,453
What is that?

224
00:15:19,487 --> 00:15:21,655
Nuke-enabled RPG.

225
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,194
Sounds like an HK416.
Yep.

226
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,096
I think it's the facility. All right.

227
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,831
We gotta move. We gotta move, now!

228
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,125
Where is everything?

229
00:15:57,158 --> 00:15:59,894
I mean, I just
thought there'd be more, uh...

230
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:01,495
What? Remains?

231
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:02,831
Yeah.

232
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,198
Well, it was protocol to keep everything

233
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:07,335
as barren as possible
around the facility.

234
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,237
You know, less chance of

235
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,973
getting something contaminated
moving around the island.

236
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:13,341
Or even worse,

237
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:17,345
off of it.

238
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,914
So much good that did.

239
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,268
What the hell was that?

240
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:49,277
Let's keep moving.

241
00:17:09,197 --> 00:17:10,498
Jerome!

242
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,906
It's locked!

243
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,191
Well, how do you get in?

244
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:40,061
The main entrance is to the north.

245
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:41,996
You sure know a lot for being a doc.

246
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,297
Hey, guys, I see something.

247
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,439
We got incoming, boys!

248
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:54,442
We got incoming!

249
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,314
Sir! Help me!

250
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,179
Get inside! Henderson! Kurtis! Inside!
Everybody inside! Go!

251
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:36,417
Get in! Get in! Come on. Come on in!

252
00:18:41,489 --> 00:18:42,490
Come on! Come on!

253
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,092
Thought you guys could use a hand.

254
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,727
I'm Henderson, Alpha Team.
That's Kurtis.

255
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,861
Gibson. Bravo Team.

256
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,430
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

257
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,732
That hole is the only way in
or out of this whole facility.

258
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,935
We've done a full recon.
Welcome to the freak show!

259
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,604
We need to get to the lab.

260
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,372
All right, Henderson, Kurtis,
you guys cover us, all right?

261
00:18:58,406 --> 00:19:02,876
Pugh, Jerome. Take the six!
Go! Let's go! Let's go!

262
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,146
Who the hell put him in charge?

263
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:47,421
Go!

264
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,435
Everyone all right? Anyone get bit?

265
00:20:02,836 --> 00:20:05,339
All good.

266
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:08,008
How long do we have before
the chopper comes back?

267
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,178
A little over eight hours.

268
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,314
Pugh, ping HQ.

269
00:20:13,347 --> 00:20:15,183
At least we let them
know we're still here.

270
00:20:15,216 --> 00:20:16,584
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:20,088
We're good.

272
00:20:20,121 --> 00:20:23,057
Let's keep moving.

273
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:25,759
Who are you, exactly?

274
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,628
Dr. Mikaela Usylvich.

275
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:31,099
First Lieutenant
Phillip Henderson. And your rank is?

276
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:32,700
CIA, Special Agent.

277
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:35,569
I deal mostly with
virus and bio-weapons.

278
00:20:35,603 --> 00:20:36,604
CIA?

279
00:20:37,338 --> 00:20:39,273
Yeah, I figured as much.

280
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,842
I didn't think a doctor could fight
like that without a little training.

281
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:45,879
Hey Gibson, you're, what, second louie?

282
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,115
First.

283
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:49,583
Ah! Rescue and retrieval, huh?

284
00:20:49,617 --> 00:20:51,685
That's right.
After HQ lost you guys,

285
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,787
they sent us in here
to see what the hell happened.

286
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:56,924
What they failed to tell you, this
is basically a suicide mission.

287
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,193
With you guys
disappearing, it became clear

288
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,628
that the island was still a hot zone.

289
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:02,730
So, that's when I came into play.

290
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,198
Well, now you found us.

291
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:06,600
So, do you think
you can get us off this rock?

292
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,336
Negative.

293
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:12,673
All we can do is ping HQ. We're on
our own for the next eight hours.

294
00:21:12,706 --> 00:21:14,808
And we're gonna get nice and comfy.

295
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,252
What the hell happened?

296
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,019
You're looking at it.

297
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,921
Murphy got too cocky,

298
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,023
sent us in unprepared.

299
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:32,693
We're ready.

300
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:35,396
Guys, I think
we're going to have a problem.

301
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:36,730
Yeah? What's that?

302
00:21:36,764 --> 00:21:38,966
The GPS tracker.

303
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:40,434
Look, I think I might have lost it

304
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:43,637
when that undead bastard tackled me.

305
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:45,906
I'm pretty sure it's still active.

306
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,775
So, what are you saying?

307
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,778
It means, in eight hours, instead
of a rescue chopper, we get...

308
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,213
Nukes.

309
00:21:52,246 --> 00:21:55,048
Can't we ping HQ, let them
know we're still here?

310
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:56,250
Zero tolerance.

311
00:21:56,284 --> 00:21:57,751
If we don't disengage that GPS,

312
00:21:57,785 --> 00:22:00,221
command is going to think
we've been compromised.

313
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:03,791
Government thinks the best way to
handle a problem is to incinerate it.

314
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,761
If it's ash, problem solved.

315
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:12,600
See anything?

316
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:16,870
Two.

317
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:18,306
On three.

318
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,808
One, two, three!

319
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:28,015
Drop the gun!

320
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,783
Drop the weapon right now!

321
00:22:29,817 --> 00:22:31,018
Down! Get down!

322
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:33,120
I'm Colonel Aidan Wexler!
This is my facility!

323
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:38,326
You are not in a secure location.
You need to come with me, now.

324
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,463
My God.

325
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:48,936
You look just like her.

326
00:22:53,073 --> 00:22:56,244
Doc, what the hell is going on?

327
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,481
He's my dad.

328
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,752
Come with me, now!

329
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,050
Please, sit, sit.

330
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,424
Please. I haven't had
visitors in over a decade. Sit.

331
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,600
No, don't... Don't worry.

332
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,335
They are all securely locked up.

333
00:23:55,368 --> 00:23:56,836
There's nothing to worry about.

334
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,238
What are they?

335
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,607
My patients.

336
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,278
I found a cure.

337
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,815
Cure?

338
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,318
Cure. Cure. Yeah,
that's what I said, "cure".

339
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:14,221
You should be eating.
Why are you not eating?

340
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:16,989
Here. Here. You must be hungry.

341
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:18,791
Here.

342
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:34,174
She was a brilliant
researcher, you know?

343
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,077
Your mother.

344
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,382
The work that we did together
at the NIH, it was just...

345
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,451
It was really groundbreaking.

346
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,556
Did she ever talk about me?

347
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,125
Yes.

348
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,661
Yes, at the end.

349
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,431
You know, by then, she assumed that...

350
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,401
Right. Yeah, of course.

351
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,437
I want you to know that I did ask her

352
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,739
to come with me to this facility. I did.

353
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,910
But she said... She just...
If I had had her help...

354
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,046
The sequencing...

355
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,716
But that... No... That's...
I mean, this is speculation.

356
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,685
Water under the bridge.
You know, bridges burn,

357
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,920
and then they fall down and
then you can't build them...

358
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,589
Can't put 'em back together.

359
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,291
You're here!

360
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:25,925
Ha!

361
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,296
You're here! This, uh...

362
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,299
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

363
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,035
It's not.

364
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:40,740
I thought this might be my only
chance to get to know your work.

365
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:44,177
I've never considered the possibility...

366
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,847
I know. That I was alive.

367
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,553
Mikaela, I'm sorry.

368
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,224
Colonel, why didn't
you try to contact HQ?

369
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,925
Let them know you're still alive?

370
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,630
What's the point? I mean...

371
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:08,235
The estimated mortality rate was total.

372
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,504
I was considered collateral damage

373
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:14,607
the minute the pathogen escaped the lab.

374
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,610
They weren't coming for me.

375
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,382
They weren't coming for any of us.

376
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:28,821
But that is the point
of a 10-year quarantine.

377
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,724
Isn't it, huh?

378
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,660
Yeah.

379
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,496
You let the epidemic run its course,

380
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,366
and kill any possible host,
and just starve it to death.

381
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,401
That's why we picked
this island, in fact.

382
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:45,938
There's a natural limit
to how far it can spread.

383
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:50,977
Yeah, but what about, like, birds and
fish? I don't know, other stuff?

384
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,681
Has there been a case of an
outbreak on the mainland?

385
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,783
No.

386
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:00,853
Then I guess that birds fish
and stuff, are not a problem.

387
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,091
What exactly went wrong, Colonel?

388
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:11,531
The order was to create a weaponized
strain of the Ebola virus.

389
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,969
And, you know, when the army
embarks on such an endeavor,

390
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:18,971
we split the work into
two tracks, all right?

391
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,108
Refining the pathogen
to make a bio-weapon,

392
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:26,546
and synthesizing
an anti-serum to defeat it.

393
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,980
Why?

394
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:30,917
Why do you have the safety
on your gun, soldier?

395
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,721
So, you don't kill yourself
with it accidentally.

396
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:38,325
What we saw out there in that
jungle, that wasn't Ebola.

397
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,926
No.

398
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,594
No. Not anymore.

399
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:43,763
The head of my bio-weapons team

400
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,098
is also my second in-command,
Captain Marshall.

401
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,900
Marshall, he...

402
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:52,639
He created some
mutated strains of the vir...

403
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,741
See, he was sloppy. Sloppy.

404
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:58,311
And you know what?
He didn't follow protocols.

405
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,714
Why have protocols if you're
not going to follow them?

406
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:07,286
So, one of his strains
was very aggressive,

407
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,357
its effects were beyond something
that we could control.

408
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,992
And so, when you're infected, it became

409
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,027
what you saw out there in the jungle.

410
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,966
Those dead and
rotting, and flesh-hungry animals,

411
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,369
devoid of any human characteristics.

412
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:25,605
What Marshall created

413
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:34,381
just wiped the soul
out of everyone it infected.

414
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,420
I was overseeing the anti-serum teams,

415
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:44,023
and we were progressing on a cure.

416
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,461
A virus that would keep it
at bay, but it was too slow.

417
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,630
You see, this is why
if I had your mother,

418
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,433
this is why it would have been
okay because this was her forte.

419
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,734
And the minute it left the lab,

420
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,703
we were all caught flat-footed.

421
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,005
I was lucky to have survived.

422
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,774
Too bad we can't say
the same for your men.

423
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:04,377
How did the pathogen escape?

424
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,817
What are you implying, soldier?

425
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,489
I have been running this
facility by myself for 10 years.

426
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:20,827
I have protocols.
I don't need your questions.

427
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,362
Okay. You don't have to
answer my questions,

428
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:27,133
but I don't think HQ is going
to be quite so patient.

429
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,938
Oh, you think that...

430
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,078
What's so funny?

431
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:47,153
I'm not going anywhere.

432
00:29:50,557 --> 00:29:55,628
The work that I've been doing here
is far too important to abandon.

433
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,634
Your work ended 10 years ago.

434
00:30:01,668 --> 00:30:05,137
My initial research, yes.

435
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,708
But what I have been working on
since the incident, Mikaela,

436
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:11,243
it is very interesting.

437
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:13,646
So, you've been
continuing your research?

438
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,718
We're scientists.
Wouldn't you?

439
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:26,225
I said I discovered a cure.

440
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:27,293
For what?

441
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,828
For death.

442
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:38,370
Do you want to see?

443
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,658
This is patient 9166.

444
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:02,662
She had been infected nearly seven
years by the time I had found her.

445
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:04,130
With the pathogen having infected

446
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,633
nearly every organism on the island,

447
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,669
coupled with a mortality rate
of nearly 100%,

448
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:14,440
finding a cure for
the virus was challenging.

449
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:18,711
I had to find a way to reverse
the effects of the virus,

450
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,813
at least to slow its progression.

451
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:25,351
And it was during my
"lab myopia," I call it.

452
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:30,923
I discovered it had an amazing
effect on human death.

453
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,601
You can see, the effects
are just fascinating.

454
00:31:41,634 --> 00:31:43,102
You're experimenting on your own people.

455
00:31:43,135 --> 00:31:46,839
No, no, no. Not people, Lieutenant.
They are cadavers.

456
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:51,578
They're just a little more animated.

457
00:31:51,611 --> 00:31:54,280
So, after all
the tests and all the death,

458
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:57,116
your research hasn't
yielded any progress.

459
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,687
There are many ways
to gauge progress, Lieutenant.

460
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,890
And, uh, my theory here says

461
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,525
that I have made remarkable
strides in modern medicine.

462
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,462
And fortunately, I don't have a
shortage of raw material to work with,

463
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:13,232
sans, of course, healthy subjects.

464
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:17,103
How do you get away
with them not attacking you?

465
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,172
Time.

466
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,009
Lots of time.

467
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:27,814
I have lived with them,
I have worked with them.

468
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,950
And, I understand them.

469
00:32:34,854 --> 00:32:39,358
You can almost say
that I've domesticated them.

470
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:41,327
Oh, my God!

471
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,529
Do not touch it!

472
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,865
They are not toys.

473
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,239
See? This one is nearly healed.

474
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:08,788
How can you call this
medicine? All I see is a horror show.

475
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:12,659
That's because you're looking
at it through laymen's eyes.

476
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:14,093
What good does this do?

477
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:18,497
Well, aside from
the myriad of gene therapies,

478
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,267
each one of these individuals...

479
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,802
Cadavers.

480
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:25,705
"Victims," would have
suffered an agonizing death,

481
00:33:25,738 --> 00:33:27,239
only to rise up again.

482
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:28,975
I saved them from that.

483
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:33,345
I gave them... I gave them a gift.

484
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,381
And what's that?

485
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:40,186
What we all want. A second chance.

486
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,725
I'd rather be dead
than some mindless pet.

487
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,193
They're not mindless.

488
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,861
What?

489
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:51,330
See? They're interacting.

490
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,332
That's correct.

491
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,201
You're as perceptive as your mother.

492
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,705
They have formed a rudimentary
social structure.

493
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,472
They're actually highly trainable.

494
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,410
I realized that if I focused
on the cortex thickness,

495
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,279
that I could actually alter...

496
00:34:08,748 --> 00:34:10,817
Would you like to meet a miracle?

497
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,190
Cheryl.

498
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,026
Come here.

499
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,661
Wexler?

500
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:25,331
Cheryl.

501
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,367
How's my favorite patient today?

502
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,070
Feeling great.

503
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,605
When can I leave?

504
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,708
I want to go home to my family.

505
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:38,310
I know, I know, and you will.

506
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:41,147
You need to rest first,
but your day will come soon.

507
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,051
Visitors.

508
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,793
Welcome. Good evening.

509
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,829
Good evening. How are you?

510
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:04,636
Feeling a lot better than yesterday.

511
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,774
Doctor Wexler is a genius.

512
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:11,143
Yes. Yes, he is.

513
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,012
I'm glad you're feeling better.

514
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,761
Okay, okay, Cheryl? Thank you.

515
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,202
Then why is the jungle full of monsters?

516
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,204
Why not just do that for everybody?

517
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,908
Because you can't cure it.
You can only suppress it.

518
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,910
That's it, isn't it?

519
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,512
That's exactly it.

520
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,215
There is no true way to reverse
the effects of the virus,

521
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,784
but you can keep it in check.

522
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,821
If you catch it in time,
there's an 86.5% chance

523
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,089
of arresting the virus spread.

524
00:35:57,123 --> 00:36:01,193
Of the 13.5% left, most
will succumb to the virus,

525
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,829
and then you just dispose of them

526
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:05,464
by destroying the hypothalamus.

527
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,799
"Most"?

528
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,701
What?

529
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,337
You just said most of the 13
and whatever percent remaining

530
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,672
can be destroyed by ripping
out the hypothalamus.

531
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,643
I'm not a scientist, but if most can
be killed that way, what's left?

532
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:23,049
I mean... Irrelevant...

533
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:24,984
Any population exposed to a virus,

534
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,954
a certain percentage is going to
display an anomalous reaction.

535
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:29,721
This is why some people get the flu

536
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,258
even though they've had their flu shots.
It's very simple.

537
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,127
But this isn't the flu, is it, Colonel?

538
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,396
This is a super-mutated
weaponized strain of Ebola,

539
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,565
so forgive me if I'm a little curious

540
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:42,368
as to what that "anomalous
reaction" might look like.

541
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,448
The anomalies.

542
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:49,468
It's much more than I could possibly...
But it doesn't... It really...

543
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,071
Um, there are accommodations
on the level below,

544
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,440
if you'd like to spend the night.

545
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,508
Uh, the building is 100% secure.

546
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,910
So, you would be safe...

547
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,445
Sure. Right, yeah.

548
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,949
Thank you, Colonel.

549
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,616
We have a slight problem.

550
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,919
We lost our GPS beacon
in the melee outside.

551
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,255
Unless we can relocate
that beacon and check in,

552
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:12,424
they're going to be lighting this whole
island up like the Fourth of July.

553
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:16,028
Okay. What's the time frame?

554
00:38:16,062 --> 00:38:17,596
About five hours.

555
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,367
Okay. Uh...

556
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,635
I will help you locate the beacon,

557
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,172
but then I think
it's best you all leave.

558
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:29,976
I will guide you to the beach through
a path in the jungle that I use

559
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,611
that is generally clear.

560
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,213
Thank you, Colonel.

561
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:37,549
In the meantime, Jerome, Pugh,
will pack up your things.

562
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:41,620
No. Uh, as I said,
I'm not going anywhere.

563
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,822
Colonel.

564
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,391
You're coming with us.

565
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,226
No, I was very clear about this.

566
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,928
I am not going to leave my research.

567
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,930
We went over this.

568
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,565
My orders from HQ...

569
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,603
I don't care what your orders are!

570
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:59,138
Dad, please, just don't.

571
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:02,008
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

572
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:05,411
No one is going to steal
my work and pervert it.

573
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:09,481
Not you, not the government,
especially, not him.

574
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:12,318
You can either come with us
willingly, Colonel,

575
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,988
or we can take you by force.

576
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:19,758
Come on. It's like birds and fish...

577
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,463
Contain him! Contain him!

578
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:30,402
He's turning! Shoot him, Gibson!

579
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,704
I'm taking him out! I'm taking him out!
Shoot him!

580
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:34,773
No! Shut up! Shut up!

581
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,342
Shoot him! Gibson, shoot him!

582
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,343
Doc!

583
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,545
Talk to me.
What? Come on. What?

584
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:40,912
Coat...

585
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,848
"Coat? Jacket?" What?

586
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,583
Coat pocket...

587
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:48,587
Okay, coat pocket. The serum's
in his lab coat, just wait!

588
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,522
You got five seconds, Doc!

589
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:52,558
Doc, whatever
you're going to do, do it now!

590
00:39:56,395 --> 00:39:58,764
- Got it!
- You got five seconds, Doc!

591
00:39:58,797 --> 00:39:59,931
Five seconds!

592
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,400
Five!

593
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,668
Jesus Christ!
He's turning! Just shoot him!

594
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,170
Four!

595
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:05,937
Three!

596
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,174
- I'm taking the shot!
- Two!

597
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,608
- Shoot him!
- One!

598
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:26,558
It's working. It's working.

599
00:40:31,197 --> 00:40:33,332
Well, this is plan 'B'.

600
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,276
Get him up!

601
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,322
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

602
00:40:56,355 --> 00:40:57,989
Let's get out of here, man.

603
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,691
This is the window of
opportunity, I say we take it.

604
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:01,093
We're leaving. Now.

605
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,095
No, no, no! I'm not going
anywhere without him!

606
00:41:03,129 --> 00:41:04,896
He is a compromise... He's my father!

607
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,166
He is a compromised asset!
We are leaving.

608
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,501
If he so much as twitches, I'm
gonna put a bullet in his brain.

609
00:41:09,535 --> 00:41:13,139
You make one move towards him,
and I'm cutting those off!

610
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:18,110
Try me.

611
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:22,514
Calm down.

612
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:28,854
Doc, we're leaving.

613
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:33,325
Listen, with this, I was able
to help control it before.

614
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,528
Now that I know what to do,
I can do it again.

615
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:41,633
We take him on a chopper,
he compromises everyone.

616
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,102
You're the scientist.

617
00:41:44,136 --> 00:41:46,705
You tell me what happens if we
introduce a pathogen like that

618
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,807
to the rest of the civilization.

619
00:41:50,442 --> 00:41:52,211
I just found him.

620
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,181
I'm sorry.

621
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:01,187
Well, now that that's that,
what are we doing?

622
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,488
We're leaving.

623
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:03,822
We've got five hours before extraction.

624
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,591
We're leaving.

625
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,459
Gibson,

626
00:42:07,493 --> 00:42:12,164
let me get to my father's lab to see
if there's any research I can salvage.

627
00:42:25,076 --> 00:42:26,312
You got one sweep.

628
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,815
One.

629
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,784
Jerome, Pugh, come with us.

630
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:36,722
See if you can find a radio,
somehow we can contact command.

631
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:38,857
Kurtis, Henderson.

632
00:42:41,293 --> 00:42:43,495
Keep an eye on that son of a bitch.

633
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,431
Yep! Roger that.

634
00:42:59,478 --> 00:43:04,216
The main lab is one level down.
The stairs should be this way.

635
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,120
Keep your heads down. Watch your six.

636
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,489
We're going to head downstairs.

637
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:11,790
See if you guys can
find a working radio.

638
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:13,225
You got it, Lieutenant.

639
00:43:26,572 --> 00:43:27,773
Nothing.

640
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:36,315
One floor down, huh?

641
00:43:36,348 --> 00:43:38,584
Doesn't look like anyone's
been down here for years.

642
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:48,794
We've got company.

643
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:54,533
I got this.

644
00:44:20,959 --> 00:44:22,294
Ready?

645
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,398
Yeah.

646
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:42,080
Well?

647
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,315
Give it a shot.

648
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:48,887
Anything?

649
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,622
Dead.

650
00:44:50,656 --> 00:44:52,724
Like everything else in this place.

651
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,271
I got to 10-1.

652
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:07,339
Now?

653
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:08,874
Yeah! Now.

654
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,333
Pugh!

655
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,585
What was that?

656
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:56,688
Get my six.

657
00:45:58,023 --> 00:45:59,858
- Good?
- Yeah.

658
00:46:13,872 --> 00:46:15,607
You think this place
can get any weirder?

659
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:18,309
Honestly? Yeah.

660
00:46:18,343 --> 00:46:20,812
Yeah. Me, too. Let's find Gibson.

661
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:43,535
Hey.

662
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:45,604
Hey, hey, hey!

663
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,499
Pst!

664
00:47:22,508 --> 00:47:24,510
Take it easy. Take it easy.

665
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:39,257
I'll take the main computer.

666
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,492
You take the filing cabinet.

667
00:47:40,526 --> 00:47:41,860
What filing cabinet?

668
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:43,795
That one.

669
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,296
What the hell am I looking for?

670
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:47,833
Anything XP 573.

671
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,855
Wait a minute.

672
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:16,962
Okay. All right, it looks like Wexler
conducted his original research

673
00:48:16,995 --> 00:48:19,197
under the official
military project name,

674
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,834
but at some point, he started
tracking it all under "Katja".

675
00:48:22,868 --> 00:48:25,236
And I can't find any hard copy
of anything after that.

676
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,539
Katja was my mother's name.

677
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,411
Here we go.

678
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:36,915
After the outbreak, my
father changed his approach.

679
00:48:36,948 --> 00:48:38,750
Instead of working on
the pathogen itself,

680
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:43,054
he began using the infected to
test and refine the anti-serum.

681
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,657
So, the bastard was
searching for a cure.

682
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:49,961
No. He was using the anti-serum,
XP 573, to enhance them.

683
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:51,730
Without the natural limitations

684
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,199
of living tissue to restrict him,

685
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:57,569
he was actually able to improve
their physical attributes.

686
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:00,205
Depending on their original
condition, of course.

687
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:04,142
So, if you're a zombie, then you
kind of get to stay a zombie.

688
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:07,012
Correct.

689
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,747
But if the infection
hasn't spread too far,

690
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:13,919
he was actually able to increase
their size and strength

691
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:16,722
well beyond the human norm.

692
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,428
Beefed-up super-zombies.
What could possibly go wrong?

693
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:26,431
Well, considering one of the side
effects is increased aggression...

694
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,666
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

695
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,334
You just said that
the fresher the victim,

696
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,369
the more effective the serum is, right?

697
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:34,105
He didn't try to inject this crap
into a living person, did he?

698
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:38,877
There are references to tests
on uninfected tissue.

699
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:42,313
Yes, right here.

700
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:45,250
Patient 1138 was given
the anti-serum first.

701
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:49,154
Results, near catastrophic
collapse of all systems.

702
00:49:51,823 --> 00:49:54,726
They actually had to use the
pathogen to balance the impact.

703
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,728
One won't work without the other.

704
00:49:56,762 --> 00:49:58,730
What the hell does that mean?

705
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,267
You gotta be freaking kidding me.

706
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:06,037
What?

707
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,040
Patient 1138...

708
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,344
I am Colonel Aidan Wexler, Patient 1138.

709
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:16,447
I have been bitten by patient 1136.

710
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:20,218
I am going to inject myself with XP 573,

711
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:23,454
which should halt the virus
at its current stage.

712
00:50:23,488 --> 00:50:26,224
And with the increased rate
of DNA synthesis,

713
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:29,294
should completely rebuild
my cellular structure.

714
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:32,063
Injecting now.

715
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:59,424
He infected himself.

716
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:18,209
What the hell did you just do?

717
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:19,244
Nothing.

718
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:38,997
Somebody tripped the alarm!

719
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,565
Uh, we have to move now.
No! Just hold on.

720
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,800
- We have to move now!
- Hold on!

721
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:43,234
We have to move right now!

722
00:51:43,268 --> 00:51:44,569
I'm going to have to bypass security

723
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:45,837
- if the alarm is...
- Now.

724
00:51:49,374 --> 00:51:50,241
- Now!
- Wait! Hold on!

725
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,877
- Doc.
- Just give me a second!

726
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:53,578
- We're moving! Let's go!
- I have to bypass security.

727
00:51:53,611 --> 00:51:56,848
The alarm has kicked in some
kind of lock-down protocol.

728
00:51:59,785 --> 00:52:01,252
We've got to move now.

729
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:07,959
Come on!

730
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,163
Got it.

731
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,532
Let's go! Come on!

732
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,201
What are you doing? What are you... Hey!

733
00:52:16,234 --> 00:52:17,468
I have to find the pathogen.

734
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:18,837
You have to find what?

735
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:20,772
The fridge. Hey!

736
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:26,377
What are you...

737
00:52:26,411 --> 00:52:29,380
Doc! Hey!

738
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:31,216
Come on! Wait!

739
00:52:54,439 --> 00:52:55,706
What the hell is that?

740
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,509
It's my dad's serum. XP 573.

741
00:52:58,543 --> 00:53:01,179
So, they sent a virologist.
How serious is that shit?

742
00:53:01,212 --> 00:53:04,315
Very. Give me your kit,
your med kit. I need it.

743
00:53:10,721 --> 00:53:12,190
You'd better keep it safe.

744
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,825
I... Shit.

745
00:53:18,063 --> 00:53:19,998
We have to go.

746
00:53:28,106 --> 00:53:30,008
Oh, shit. What?

747
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,643
I think I just opened up
the whole security system.

748
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:34,479
Why would you open up
the whole security system?

749
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:36,281
I don't know! I just opened it!
I just opened it!

750
00:53:36,314 --> 00:53:37,715
Keep your voice down! We gotta go now!

751
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:38,950
Wait.

752
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:42,753
- Come on, Doc!
- Got it!

753
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,489
Let's go!

754
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,957
Shit!

755
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:13,018
Henderson! Kurtis! We gotta move...

756
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,898
Jerome.

757
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,242
Come on. Let's go find them.

758
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,912
Henderson!

759
00:55:47,945 --> 00:55:49,514
Guys?

760
00:55:50,648 --> 00:55:52,050
Kurtis!

761
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,431
Where the hell are we?

762
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:09,134
Some sort of hellish nightmare, man.

763
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:14,139
I just wish someone would wake me up.

764
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:23,214
Let's keep going.

765
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:25,550
Huh?

766
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,207
Henderson!

767
00:56:50,108 --> 00:56:52,677
Gentlemen. Stand down!

768
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:56,581
Put 'em down! I said, now!

769
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:04,655
Tell me, what kind of trouble
did you get yourselves into?

770
00:58:11,356 --> 00:58:12,790
Pugh?

771
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:15,793
Jerome?

772
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,404
Is that Pugh?

773
00:58:28,173 --> 00:58:30,608
Let's move. Move.

774
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:35,240
Boys.

775
00:59:40,245 --> 00:59:41,679
No, no, no!

776
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:48,586
Pugh. Hey! What happened?

777
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,888
Pugh?

778
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,128
Found you.

779
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:00,531
What's going on here, Colonel?

780
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:09,507
Just an average day
on the Isle of the Dead.

781
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:17,548
You're a disgusting
human being, you know that?

782
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,050
Mikaela.

783
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,619
Disgusting.

784
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:27,692
Mikaela, listen to me.

785
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,630
Do you know why
we even named you "Mikaela"?

786
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:36,367
It's Dutch. It means "like a God".

787
01:00:37,602 --> 01:00:39,337
That's the work of scientists.

788
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:42,673
It's what we do. It's what your
mother and I did together.

789
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:46,811
It's the work that
you and I can do together.

790
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,981
The right to be a god is yours.

791
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:53,418
If you want to work with me.

792
01:00:53,451 --> 01:00:55,820
Father and daughter.

793
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:59,990
We're not family. You're not my father.
Not anymore.

794
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:09,600
No, you need time to think about this.

795
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:13,137
Time is something
you don't have, Colonel.

796
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,341
That GPS beacon outside,
it's still ticking.

797
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:18,008
In a little less than two hours,

798
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:20,177
that's going to become a welcome
mat for enough Trident missiles

799
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,914
to turn this whole island into a warm
spot at the bottom of the ocean.

800
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,219
Unless you let my men go.

801
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:31,956
So, we can deactivate it and
get to the chopper in time.

802
01:01:33,257 --> 01:01:34,659
So, you can either help us,

803
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:40,331
or we can all die together.

804
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:50,074
What's it gonna be, Colonel?

805
01:01:51,709 --> 01:01:54,912
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

806
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:56,080
Where are the keys?

807
01:01:56,113 --> 01:01:57,515
The keys are on the desk.

808
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:06,991
Oh! No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
I wouldn't do that. No.

809
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,025
Why not?

810
01:02:10,595 --> 01:02:12,096
What'd you do?

811
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:19,937
I'm sorry.

812
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:21,038
I can't help myself.

813
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,807
You didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

814
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:25,810
You son of a bitch.

815
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,379
Why?

816
01:02:28,413 --> 01:02:30,381
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

817
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:32,850
- The others?
- No. No.

818
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:41,058
He's turning.

819
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,198
Do you want me to?

820
01:02:49,667 --> 01:02:50,735
No.

821
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,303
Help the others.

822
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,072
I'll do it.

823
01:03:17,528 --> 01:03:18,996
I'm sorry, Pugh.

824
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:22,700
Sir. Yes, sir.

825
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:26,437
Now, let's just finish this, all right?

826
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:30,575
Please?

827
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:30,134
Are you okay?

828
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:31,168
Yeah.

829
01:04:33,571 --> 01:04:35,072
You let them out?

830
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:40,645
Oh.

831
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,147
That isn't good.

832
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:47,051
We got company.

833
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:53,958
Clear!

834
01:04:53,991 --> 01:04:55,960
What are we looking out for?

835
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:56,827
My mistakes.

836
01:04:56,861 --> 01:04:58,462
What do you mean?

837
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:01,732
Experiments with inferior DNA
that went a little too far.

838
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:04,835
Realistically,
what are we talking about?

839
01:05:04,869 --> 01:05:06,671
Your worst nightmares.

840
01:05:13,978 --> 01:05:15,045
Go! Go!

841
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:30,094
Go! Go! Go! Move it!

842
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,711
We're surrounded! They're coming!

843
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:54,885
Go! Go! Up the stairs, and to the left.
I'll hold them off.

844
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:56,053
Come on! Come on! Come on!

845
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:58,255
- I said, go!
- Go! Go! Go!

846
01:06:02,426 --> 01:06:04,094
Wexler.

847
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:10,200
It's been a long time.

848
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:32,657
Jerome! Come on! Jerome!

849
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:36,193
Jerome! Come on! Come on! Look at me!

850
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:40,931
Easy! Easy! Okay! All right!
Come on! Okay, okay.

851
01:06:40,965 --> 01:06:43,400
- Jerome! Don't you do it.
- Just shoot!

852
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:44,969
I'm already dead!

853
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,371
- Come with us!
- Put it down! Put it down, man!

854
01:06:47,404 --> 01:06:48,605
Don't do it!

855
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,075
Go!

856
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:54,011
- Jerome, don't you do it, man!
- Don't you do it! No!

857
01:06:56,546 --> 01:06:57,948
Fuck!

858
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:02,186
Let's go.

859
01:07:04,755 --> 01:07:06,190
Let's go!

860
01:07:26,711 --> 01:07:29,947
Doc, come on! Doc!

861
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:34,351
Kurtis, find that GPS. Deactivate it.

862
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:35,585
Yes, sir.

863
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,187
This island deserves to get nuked.

864
01:07:37,221 --> 01:07:41,225
Yeah, but not while we're on it.
Here. Take this.

865
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,293
Henderson, take her to
the rendezvous point.

866
01:07:43,327 --> 01:07:45,262
Yes, sir. Where are you going?

867
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:46,797
I'm going to find the little party favor

868
01:07:46,831 --> 01:07:48,432
Henderson and his team left here for us.

869
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,567
The chopper's going to
be here in 90 minutes.

870
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,169
I'll see you there!

871
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,282
Stop!

872
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:28,638
What are you waiting for?

873
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:31,708
Waiting to kill my master!

874
01:09:15,352 --> 01:09:17,287
Where the hell are you?

875
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,815
There you are.

876
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:01,892
Keep your eyes open.

877
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:04,561
Hold.

878
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,382
Henderson?

879
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,018
Do it.

880
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:03,187
Do it!

881
01:12:03,853 --> 01:12:06,223
Do it!

882
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:59,176
Mikaela!

883
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:28,064
Captain!

884
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:32,001
It's Gibson.

885
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:40,144
I'm going to have to kill you, Captain.

886
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,491
I stopped the clock.

887
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,294
No one's coming for you.

888
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:19,569
Attack!

889
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:17,060
Marshall!

890
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,390
I'm going to kill you!

891
01:19:25,995 --> 01:19:26,996
Go.

892
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:29,666
Go!

893
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:06,936
Doc!

894
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,440
Doc!

895
01:20:11,475 --> 01:20:14,210
The chopper's here! Doc!

896
01:20:14,243 --> 01:20:17,113
Come on! We gotta go! Hey.

897
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,715
Are you okay?

898
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:30,594
You know what you have to do. Please.

899
01:20:32,128 --> 01:20:34,330
Maybe if we can get to the chopper

900
01:20:34,363 --> 01:20:37,133
and inject the serum,
it can slow down the process.

901
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:41,538
Go.

902
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:45,709
Marshall has activated the GPS. Go!

903
01:20:58,688 --> 01:21:00,724
Come on! We have to go!

904
01:22:28,878 --> 01:22:30,113
Mikaela!

905
01:23:29,438 --> 01:23:30,774
I'm sorry.

906
01:23:36,445 --> 01:23:37,981
I'm sorry.

907
01:23:39,749 --> 01:23:41,250
I'm sorry.

908
01:23:52,729 --> 01:23:54,197
Do it!

909
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,332
Please.

910
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:01,337
Do it!

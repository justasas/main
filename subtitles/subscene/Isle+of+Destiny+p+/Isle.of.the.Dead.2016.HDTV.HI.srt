this island is beyond reclamation

So, assuming we get
out of here as planned,

that scared you.

So, what's it gonna be, Lieutenant?

197

Are you gonna do what you came here
to do? Or are you going to run away?

They are all securely locked up.

There's nothing to worry about.

373

What are they?

00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,607
My patients.

375
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,278
I found a cure.

376
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,815
Cure?

377
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:11,318
Cure. Cure. Yeah,
that's what I said, "cure".

378
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:14,221
You should be eating.
Why are you not eating?

379
00:24:14,254 --> 00:24:16,989
Here. Here.
You must be hungry.

382

Your mother.

383
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,382
The work that we did together
at the NIH, it was just...

384
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,451
It was really groundbreaking.

385
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,556
Did she ever talk about me?

386
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,125
Yes.

387
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,661
Yes, at the end.

388
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:58,431
You know, by then, she assumed that...

389
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:01,401
Right. Yeah, of course.

390
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,437
I want you to know that I did ask her

391
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,739
to come with me to
this facility. I did.

392
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:10,910
But she said... She just...
If I had had her help...

393
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,645
(STAMMERING)

394
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:14,046
The sequencing...

395
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,716
But that... No... That's...
I mean, this is speculation.

Water under the bridge.
You know, bridges burn,

397
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,920
and then they fall down and
then you can't build them...

398
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:22,589
Can't put 'em back together.

399
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,291
You're here!

400
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:25,925
Ha!

401
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,296
You're here! This, uh...

402
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,299
This isn't a coincidence, is it?

403
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,035
It's not.

404
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:40,740
I thought this might be my only
chance to get to know your work.

405
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:44,177
I've never considered the possibility...

406
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,847
I know. That I was alive.

407
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,553
Mikaela, I'm sorry.

408
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,224
Colonel, why didn't
you try to contact HQ?

409
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,925
Let them know you're still alive?

410
00:26:00,493 --> 00:26:03,630
What's the point? I mean...

411
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:08,235
The estimated mortality rate was total.

412
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,504
I was considered collateral damage

413
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:14,607
the minute the pathogen escaped the lab.

414
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:17,610
They weren't coming for me.

415
00:26:19,312 --> 00:26:22,382
They weren't coming for any of us.

416
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:28,821
But that is the point
of a 10-year quarantine.

417
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:31,724
Isn't it, huh?

418
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,660
Yeah.

419
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,496
You let the epidemic run its course,

420
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,366
and kill any possible host,
and just starve it to death.

421
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:41,401
That's why we picked
this island, in fact.

422
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:45,938
There's a natural limit
to how far it can spread.

423
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:50,977
Yeah, but what about, like, birds and
fish? I don't know, other stuff?

424
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,681
Has there been a case of an
outbreak on the mainland?

425
00:26:55,248 --> 00:26:56,783
No.

426
00:26:56,816 --> 00:27:00,853
Then I guess that birds fish
and stuff, are not a problem.

427
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:05,091
What exactly went wrong, Colonel?

428
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:11,531
The order was to create a weaponized
strain of the Ebola virus.

429
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,969
And, you know, when the army
embarks on such an endeavor,

430
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:18,971
we split the work into
two tracks, all right?

431
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:22,108
Refining the pathogen
to make a bio-weapon,

432
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:26,546
and synthesizing
an anti-serum to defeat it.

433
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:27,980
Why?

434
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:30,917
Why do you have the safety
on your gun, soldier?

435
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,721
So, you don't kill yourself
with it accidentally.

436
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:38,325
What we saw out there in that
jungle, that wasn't Ebola.

437
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,926
WEXLER: No.

438
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,594
No. Not anymore.

439
00:27:41,628 --> 00:27:43,763
The head of
my bio-weapons team

440
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,098
is also my second in-command,
Captain Marshall.

441
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,900
Marshall, he...

442
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:52,639
He created some
mutated strains of the vir...

443
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,741
See, he was sloppy. Sloppy.

444
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:58,311
And you know what?
He didn't follow protocols.

445
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,714
Why have protocols if you're
not going to follow them?

446
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:07,286
So, one of his strains
was very aggressive,

447
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,357
its effects were beyond something
that we could control.

448
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,992
And so, when you're infected, it became

449
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,027
what you saw out there in the jungle.

450
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,966
(STAMMERING) Those dead and
rotting, and flesh-hungry animals,

451
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,369
devoid of any human characteristics.

452
00:28:22,402 --> 00:28:25,605
What Marshall created

453
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:34,381
just wiped the soul
out of everyone it infected.

454
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:40,420
I was overseeing
the anti-serum teams,

455
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:44,023
and we were progressing on a cure.

456
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:48,461
A virus that would keep it
at bay, but it was too slow.

457
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:50,630
You see, this is why
if I had your mother,

458
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,433
this is why it would have been
okay because this was her forte.

459
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,734
And the minute it left the lab,

460
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,703
we were all
caught flat-footed.

461
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,005
I was lucky to have survived.

462
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,774
Too bad we can't say
the same for your men.

463
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:04,377
How did the pathogen escape?

464
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,817
What are you implying, soldier?

465
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,489
I have been running this
facility by myself for 10 years.

00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:20,827
I have protocols.
I don't need your questions.

467
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,362
Okay. You don't have to
answer my questions,

468
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:27,133
but I don't think HQ is going
to be quite so patient.

469
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,938

482
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,828
For death.

years by the time I had found her.

nearly every organism on the island,

coupled with a mortality rate
of nearly 100%,

490
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:14,440
finding a cure for
the virus was challenging.

491
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:18,711
I had to find a way to reverse
the effects of the virus,

492
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,813
at least to slow its progression.

493
00:31:20,847 --> 00:31:25,351
And it was during my
"lab myopia," I call it.

494
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:30,923
I discovered it had an amazing
effect on human death.

You can see, the effects
are just fascinating.

yielded any progress.

strides in modern medicine.

527
00:33:27,273 --> 00:33:28,975
I saved them from that.

528
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:33,345
(STAMMERS) I gave them...
I gave them a gift.

529
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,381
And what's that?

530
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:40,186
What we all want.
A second chance.

531
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,725
I'd rather be dead
than some mindless pet.

532
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,193
They're not mindless.

533
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,861
HENDERSON: What?

534
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:51,330
See? They're interacting.

535
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,332
WEXLER: That's correct.

536
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,201
You're as perceptive as your mother.

537
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:58,705
They have formed a rudimentary
social structure.

538
00:33:58,738 --> 00:34:00,472
They're actually highly trainable.

539
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:04,410
I realized that if I focused
on the cortex thickness,

540
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:07,279
that I could actually alter...

How's my favorite patient today?

547
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,070
Feeling great.

00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,708

I know, I know, and you will.

553
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,793
Welcome. Good evening.

554
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:56,829
Good evening. How are you?

555
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:04,636
Feeling a lot better than yesterday.

556
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,774
Doctor Wexler is a genius.

557
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:11,143
Yes. Yes, he is.

558
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:13,012
I'm glad you're feeling better.

559
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,761
Okay, okay, Cheryl? Thank you.

560
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,202
Then why is the jungle full of monsters?

561
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:38,204
Why not just do that for everybody?

562
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,908
Because you can't cure it.
You can only suppress it.

563
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:43,910
That's it, isn't it?

564
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:46,512
That's exactly it.

565
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,215
There is no true way to reverse
the effects of the virus,

566
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,784
but you can keep it in check.

567
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:54,821
If you catch it in time,
there's an 86.5% chance

568
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:57,089
of arresting the virus spread.

569
00:35:57,123 --> 00:36:01,193
Of the 13.5% left, most
will succumb to the virus,

570
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:02,829
and then you just dispose of them

571
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:05,464
by destroying the hypothalamus.

572
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,799
"Most"?

573
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,701
WEXLER: What?

574
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,337
You just said most of the 13
and whatever percent remaining

575
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,672
can be destroyed by ripping
out the hypothalamus.

576
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:17,643
I'm not a scientist, but if most can
be killed that way, what's left?

I mean... Irrelevant...

579
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:24,984
Any population exposed to a virus,

580
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,954
a certain percentage is going to
display an anomalous reaction.

581
00:36:27,987 --> 00:36:29,721
This is why some people get the flu

582
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:32,258
even though they've had their flu shots.
It's very simple.

GIBSON:
But this isn't the flu, is it, Colonel?

584
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:37,396
This is a super-mutated
weaponized strain of Ebola,

585
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,565
so forgive me if I'm a little curious

586
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:42,368
as to what that "anomalous
reaction" might look like.

588
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,448
The anomalies.

589
00:37:44,897 --> 00:37:49,468
It's much more than I could possibly...
But it doesn't... It really...

590
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,071
Um, there are accommodations
on the level below,

00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,508
Uh, the building is 100% secure.

593
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,910
So, you would be safe...

594
00:37:57,944 --> 00:37:59,445
Sure. Right, yeah.

Thank you, Colonel.

596
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:04,616
We have a slight problem.

597
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,919
We lost our GPS beacon
in the melee outside.

Unless we can relocate
that beacon and check in,

island up like the Fourth of July.

About five hours.

00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:21,367
Okay. Uh...

603
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,635
I will help you locate the beacon,

604
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,172
but then I think
it's best you all leave.

605
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:29,976
I will guide you to the beach through
a path in the jungle that I use

606
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:32,611
that is generally clear.

will pack up your things.

under the official

Instead of working on
the pathogen itself,

744
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:43,054
he began using the infected to
test and refine the anti-serum.

745
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,657
So, the bastard was
searching for a cure.

746
00:48:45,691 --> 00:48:49,961
No. He was using the anti-serum,
XP 573, to enhance them.

747
00:48:49,995 --> 00:48:51,730
Without the natural limitations

748
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,199
of living tissue to restrict him,

749
00:48:54,232 --> 00:48:57,569
he was actually able to improve
their physical attributes.

750
00:48:57,603 --> 00:49:00,205
Depending on their original
condition, of course.

But if the infection
hasn't spread too far,

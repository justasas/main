1
00:00:51,754 --> 00:00:54,143
Don't-Don't... Damn.

2
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:59,508
Destiny's a pretty big concept
when you think about it...

3
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:04,189
where you are in life,
how you got there...

4
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:06,788
what would have happened if one thing
or another had been different.

5
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:13,629
To be honest, I never gave it
much thought myself...

6
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:16,672
until today,June 14...

7
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:18,984
my 35th birthday...

8
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,669
and, without a doubt,
the strangest day of my life.

9
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:31,793
You remember
the old story that starts...

10
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,069
"This guy goes into a bar"?

11
00:01:34,154 --> 00:01:37,191
Well, I'm the guy...

12
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:39,265
and here's the story.

13
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:41,914
But wait a minute.
I'm gettin' way ahead of myself.

14
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,423
To tell this story right...

15
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:50,223
I should start where it really begins..
20 years ago.

16
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:52,350
Twenty years ago today,
as a matter of fact.

17
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:56,473
June 14, 1970...
my 15th birthday...

18
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:59,864
and also a very strange day.

19
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:04,951
It was the all-state
high school championship game..

20
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,832
bottom of the ninth, two outs.

21
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:11,623
Our school hadn't made it
to the finals in 25 years...

22
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,672
so out of a town
of 30,000 people...

23
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:16,824
38,000 showed up
for the game.

24
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:22,272
Fillmore High had us by a run,
and it was a three-two count.

25
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,424
Fenwick was standing on third
like the bag was getting ready...

26
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,630
to explode under his feet.

27
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:29,592
The championship had
come down to one batter.

28
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:34,589
Yeah, you guessed it-
yours truly, Larry Burrows.

29
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,183
Haskins was throwing fastballs because
that was the only pitch he ever threw.

30
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:43,790
So I was ready
for the next one.

31
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:47,105
Paste it, Lar! You can do it.
Have an eye! Have an eye!

32
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:50,152
Swing, babe! It's all yours!

33
00:02:51,194 --> 00:02:53,583
Then something weird happened.

34
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:58,311
Don't ask me what it was, 'cause it only
happened for a split second...

35
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:03,830
but that was enough
to change my life forever.

36
00:03:10,754 --> 00:03:12,472
Strike three!

37
00:03:12,554 --> 00:03:15,227
Why is it when you do
something terrific...

38
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,874
nine times out of ten,
you're all alone...

39
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:20,149
but when you
screw up really big...

40
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,464
the whole world is watching?

41
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:27,232
I wanted to crawl under home plate
and never come out.

42
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:33,266
As usual, my best friend, Clip metzler,
tried to cheer me up.

43
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:34,946
Clip's very big on novelty gags.

44
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:40,587
Hey, aren't they cool?
I scared the crap out of my baby sister.

45
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:42,665
- Wanna try 'em on?
- Thanks, Clipper...

46
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:45,109
but I'd kinda
like to be alone for a while.

47
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,185
Sure, Lar.
Whatever you say.

48
00:03:52,034 --> 00:03:55,549
Look, I'll call you later, okay?
We'll go see a movie or something.

49
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:56,908
<i>We could see
Bonnie and Clyde again.</i>

50
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,508
- What do you say?
- Sure, Clip.

51
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,983
Great! Great!
I'll see you later then, okay?

52
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:09,834
It was the worst moment
of my life.

53
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,905
God, I felt bad.

54
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,145
Looks like you could use
one of these.

55
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:35,590
Oh, yeah, yeah. I must've gotten
some dust in my eyes.

56
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,790
Yeah. Yeah, there was a lot
of dust out there.

57
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:40,707
- Thanks.
- Oh, it's okay. You can keep it.

58
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:44,753
my aunt sends me
two dozen every Christmas.

59
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,473
What's ',',EJR" stand for?

60
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:51,308
Ellen Jane Ripley.
What's your name?

61
00:04:51,394 --> 00:04:54,352
Larry. Larry Joseph Burrows.

62
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,470
Nice to meet you, Larry.

63
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:00,222
I thought that was really sweet,
her giving me the handkerchief...

64
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:03,863
and not saying anything
about me crying like a big baby.

65
00:05:03,954 --> 00:05:06,149
- Really sweet.
- Larry?

66
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:09,863
- So I married her.
- I've been calling you for the last five minutes.

67
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:14,505
Not right then, of course. Several years
later, when we were grownups.

68
00:05:14,594 --> 00:05:18,553
Oh, honey, were you thinking about
that silly baseball game again?

69
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:24,824
No. No. Not at all. I was working
on my, uh, '55 Porsche Spyder.

70
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:29,385
I was, really.
Look. Ain't it a beaut?

71
00:05:29,474 --> 00:05:31,829
You know James Dean
used to drive one of these?

72
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,030
I mean, his was much bigger.

73
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,026
Ellen and I have
a pretty regular life.

74
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,629
We have a little two-bedroom house in
the suburbs that isn't quite finished...

75
00:05:40,714 --> 00:05:44,593
and a contractor named Guzelman
who doesn't wanna quite finish it.

76
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:49,031
Hey, mr Guzelman.
How are ya?

77
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,787
Geez, I haven't seen you
in the past six weeks.

78
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:55,264
I thought you were captured
by some aliens or something.

79
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,152
I got your message.
Uh, problem with something?

80
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:01,624
Uh, yeah,
it's the, uh, driveway.

81
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:06,026
- What's wrong with it?
- Well, you think maybe we could pave it?

82
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:10,027
Oh, you can't, uh, pave
until the mud is all gone.

83
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:14,864
Well, then we just have to get
rid of the mud then, right?

84
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:16,945
I don't do mud.

85
00:06:17,034 --> 00:06:20,629
- You need a mud guy for that.
- A mud guy?

86
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,433
- Yes. - They have that?
- Yes. A mud guy, yes.

87
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:28,623
- Anything else?
- Well, now that you mention it, uh...

88
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:32,024
- it would be nice to have a front lawn.
- I must need a cheque for that.

89
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:35,026
- How much this time?
- A thousand.

90
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:38,584
- Don't you guys know any another number?
- Two thousand.

91
00:06:40,874 --> 00:06:42,785
We have a dog named Sammy.

92
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:46,184
I found him rooting through some garbage
in an alley, so I brought him home.

93
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:51,587
- Sammy peed on the rug again.
- Way to go, Sammy.

94
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:54,666
He has a nervous bladder
but a good heart.

95
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:57,552
Honey, uh, we're out of Wheaties.
Do we have another box?

96
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:01,104
No. I forgot to buy any.
Sorry.

97
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:03,389
Oh, sweetheart, I-I've only had
Wheaties for breakfast...

98
00:07:03,474 --> 00:07:05,942
every morning of my life
since I was six years old.

99
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,548
Is it too much to ask
that we keep an extra box on hand...

100
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,784
in the event of a crisis like this?

101
00:07:12,674 --> 00:07:14,790
You gave Guzelman
another cheque.

102
00:07:14,874 --> 00:07:18,389
Come on. I did not give Guzelman
another cheque!

103
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:22,069
And you're pissed off,
so you're taking it out on me.

104
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:25,703
Okay, okay. So I gave
Guzelman another cheque.

105
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:30,306
Don't you hate it when somebody
knows you that well?

106
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:32,954
You can't get away
with anything.

107
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:36,947
But I guess
that's just part of marriage.

108
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:38,626
So's the occasional argument.

109
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:42,946
- Oh, look. They're tearing down ',',The Golf of mexico. "
- Oh.

110
00:07:43,034 --> 00:07:47,312
- That's where we went on our first date, remember?
- No. That was our second date.

111
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,669
No. It was our first date.
I remember because...

112
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:52,632
you tripped over the grinning ',',bandito"
and split your pants.

113
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,944
No. Our first date
was at mr Pizza.

114
00:07:55,034 --> 00:07:58,549
I remember because you ate anchovies
and belched all night.

115
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:03,344
That was our third date, and I just
burped a few times, thank you very much.

116
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:05,948
But we never argue
about anything important...

117
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,025
and we always make up.

118
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:14,229
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay.
All right. See you after work.

119
00:08:14,314 --> 00:08:16,669
- Oh, I forgot.
- What?

120
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:18,949
I'm gonna be late tonight.
There's a union meeting.

121
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,150
Another one? What for?

122
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,953
They're electing a strike committee.
They want me to be chairman.

123
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:27,549
Somebody has to stop these management
creeps from laying everybody off.

124
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:32,910
But it's my birthday.

125
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:36,589
- What'd you say?
- Never mind. Forget it.

126
00:08:38,714 --> 00:08:40,830
She forgot.

127
00:08:42,074 --> 00:08:44,065
I need some coffee.

128
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:49,468
So far, nothing had happened to make me
think that this was going to be...

129
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:53,513
anything more than just another
routine day at the office.

130
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:57,428
As usual, by the time I arrived,
there was no coffee left...

131
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,429
and no water.

132
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:05,505
Great.

133
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:12,110
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

134
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,908
Gotta have my coffee.

135
00:09:18,994 --> 00:09:22,953
Why is it every time you have a mouthful
of freeze-dried, your boss walks in on you?

136
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:26,583
Hey, how they hangin', Lar?
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

137
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:29,188
No, no, mr Bumpers.
I'm just having my morning coffee.

138
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:32,072
Hey, lay off
the ',',mr Bumpers" crap, Lar.

139
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,145
Huh? How many times
do I gotta tell you?

140
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,384
We're both on the same team here.

141
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:40,023
Jackie's a real sweet guy,
but kinda dumb for a company president.

142
00:09:40,114 --> 00:09:42,787
When I played for the Bears,
they used to call me ',',Cement Head"...

143
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,865
but you can call me Jackie.

144
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:48,708
- Yes, sir,Jackie.
- I was just goin' over the quarterly reports, Lar.

145
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:52,230
Damn fine work.
It's a real touchdown.

146
00:09:52,314 --> 00:09:55,943
- Thank you, sir. I'm just trying to do my job.
- And don't think I don't appreciate it.

147
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:59,470
A quarterback's only as good
as his linemen. Am I right?

148
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:02,352
- Yep.
- Hell, I'm just some old big, dumb jock...

149
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,106
who got lucky
and married the boss's daughter.

150
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:13,787
It's guys like you
make me look like a hotshot.

151
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,466
I appreciate it, sir. Thank you.

152
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:17,624
Well, Lar...

153
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:20,353
just, uh, keep up
the good work, huh?

154
00:10:20,434 --> 00:10:22,152
I just came by to see
how you were doin'.

155
00:10:27,674 --> 00:10:29,665
Now, that's funny.

156
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:35,348
Toilet paper in the nose.
Now, why didn't I think of that?

157
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,665
Aw, Clip, thanks a lot. I'm trying to get
a promotion! All you do is goof around?

158
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:42,463
Will you relax?
Your suck points are safe.

159
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,307
Believe me, old Cement Head
didn't notice a thing.

160
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,192
Oh, Clip, you kill me.

161
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:51,224
Happy 35th, buddy.

162
00:10:51,314 --> 00:10:54,909
Well, thanks, Clip. You know, I honestly
didn't think anybody remembered.

163
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,153
Oh, this is great. Wow.

164
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,785
- Artificial puke.
- That's the stuff we used to throw...

165
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,752
into the girls' locker room to scare 'em
into runnin' out in their underwear.

166
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:09,952
- This is it, the actual stuff? - mm-hmm.
- I thought mr Green confiscated this.

167
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:14,550
He did, but I broke into his office
the next day. I confiscated it back.

168
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:16,829
Oh, man, we had fun in those days,
didn't we?

169
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:18,950
We sure did.

170
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:22,549
Well, where's
my "thank you" kiss?

171
00:11:22,634 --> 00:11:26,149
- Oh, no, Clip. No kiss. - Come
on. Just one. - Oh, no. No kisses.

172
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:29,544
- We're in the office. Now stop it! Stop it!
- Larry, come on. - Get away from me, you jerk!

173
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:32,626
Why is it every time your best friend's
kissing you on the head...

174
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:35,990
a beautiful woman
comes along and catches you?

175
00:11:37,514 --> 00:11:40,028
Hi, Cindy Jo. Hi. How are you?
How have you been?

176
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:42,787
Uh- Oh, you know, what a coincidence.
You know,Jackie Earle was just here.

177
00:11:42,874 --> 00:11:45,866
We-We were talkin'.
Jackie Earle, you know, your husband.

178
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:48,388
Boy, he looks good. How you been,
anyway? We've been fine.

179
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,863
Uh, Clip and I are pretty good.
You know, busy and all.

180
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:52,990
Work, work, work.
That's what we do, you know.

181
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:55,508
- How you been?
- I've been fine, Larry.

182
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:58,154
Thank you for asking...
three times.

183
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:04,546
Oh. Well, I just wanted to,
you know, make absolutely sure.

184
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:08,627
Cindy Jo's father owns the company,
and she's married to Jackie.

185
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:11,592
That's how a guy named Cement Head
gets to be president.

186
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:14,666
- Did Jackie go back to his office?
- Yeah.

187
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,229
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he did.
He had lots of work to do.

188
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:21,670
Uh, you know,
touchdowns and all that stuff.

189
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:25,349
Well, it was nice seeing you again,
Larry. Bye, Clip.

190
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:32,826
Always nice seeing you too, Cindy.

191
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,905
maybe it was because
it was my birthday.

192
00:12:34,994 --> 00:12:39,033
maybe it was seeing Cindy Jo.
I don't know.

193
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:42,550
But all morning, I'd been thinking about
what it would have been like...

194
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:44,989
if my life
had turned out differently.

195
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,063
You ever have
any regrets, Clip...

196
00:12:48,152 --> 00:12:50,108
you know, about how your life
has turned out...

197
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,706
or about choices you made?

198
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:57,342
No. Oh.

199
00:12:57,432 --> 00:12:59,787
- No.
- Oh.

200
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:01,988
But I figure I didn't make
all that many choices.

201
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,269
You know what my policy is?
You do nothing. You see what happens.

202
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:09,265
- And you know what? Things always seem to turn out fine.
- Yeah, for you, Clip.

203
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:12,867
Well, you know what your problem is?
Nothin's ever good enough for you.

204
00:13:12,952 --> 00:13:15,102
The way I see it,
you've got the perfect life.

205
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:19,026
You've got a wonderful home,
a terrific wife, a good job...

206
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:22,582
and the best friend
money can buy.

207
00:13:22,672 --> 00:13:24,663
What else could a guy want?

208
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:27,220
A little excitement
would be nice.

209
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:30,827
I am so mad,
I could scream.

210
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:34,427
maddie and Heather were both laid off due
to slow sales or some bullshit like that.

211
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,503
Do you believe it?
It's not fair.

212
00:13:36,592 --> 00:13:38,981
They are laying people off and making
the rest of us work double shifts...

213
00:13:39,072 --> 00:13:42,109
- to keep production levels up.
- She's got a point, you know.

214
00:13:42,192 --> 00:13:45,025
I just did an inventory check,
and there's a surplus.

215
00:13:45,112 --> 00:13:48,866
So, technically, we should be cutting back
on production levels, not keeping them up.

216
00:13:48,952 --> 00:13:51,341
Can you check into it, please, Larry?

217
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:54,026
The next person to be laid off
could be me.

218
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:56,387
Looking back,
I should have said no...

219
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,463
but I didn't...

220
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,907
Yeah, well, uh, I'll look into it.

221
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:03,745
- because I'm an idiot.
- Honey, come on.

222
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:10,062
- What? She always kisses me.
- I'm eating.

223
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:13,303
And sure enough, when the head
of my department, Niles Pender...

224
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:15,383
announced he was raising
production levels...

225
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,509
I couldn't keep
my big idiot mouth shut.

226
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:24,863
A comment, Burrows,
or merely phlegm rising in your throat?

227
00:14:24,952 --> 00:14:28,831
Um, well, uh...

228
00:14:28,912 --> 00:14:30,789
well, just a thought here, Niles.

229
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:34,626
Why do we need more product when
we already have a surplus inventory?

230
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:37,909
And on what are you basing
this so-called surplus?

231
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:40,267
Well, on the fact that...

232
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:47,348
that I recently counted
every box in the warehouse.

233
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:50,868
Well, then I would say we have a problem
with our mutual perception of reality.

234
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:56,423
Sorry to barge in, Niles. Do Jackie
and I need to be here for anything?

235
00:14:56,512 --> 00:15:00,300
Not at all, mr Hansen.
Just boring production details.

236
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,464
Leo Hansen owns the company.
He's a very sweet man...

237
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,861
but I don't think he has a clue
about what's going on.

238
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:07,510
Then it's off
to the golf course.

239
00:15:07,592 --> 00:15:10,470
my son-in-law's gonna show me
how to get rid of my slice.

240
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:15,262
I think I speak for all of us, sir,
when I say that is wonderful news.

241
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:18,867
Oh, by the way. What time
is that meeting with mr Nakamura?

242
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:21,910
- 8:00, sir.
- Won't be a long one, will it?

243
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,823
We have a dinner reservation
at 9:00.

244
00:15:23,912 --> 00:15:27,427
Well, we do have some pretty important
business to finalize, sir.

245
00:15:27,512 --> 00:15:29,821
Oh, well...

246
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:34,224
- maybe I'd better cancel the reservation.
- I think that's an excellent idea.

247
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:37,429
That's what I'll do then.
Goodbye, all.

248
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,792
Touchdowns, everyone.

249
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:44,943
Incredible.

250
00:15:46,432 --> 00:15:49,981
All right, Burrows. Since we seem to
have a disagreement over the inventory...

251
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:52,028
I suggest you check it again.

252
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,781
Well, that would take about
three or four days.

253
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,385
Well, I don't see
a problem with that.

254
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:01,827
Do you see a problem
with that, Burrows?

255
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:06,144
Well, do you, Burrows?

256
00:16:08,272 --> 00:16:10,786
No. No, sir.

257
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:14,990
I- I should have told Niles
about the inventory surplus myself...

258
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:18,747
but, I mean, the guy scares
the shit out of me, you know?

259
00:16:18,832 --> 00:16:20,823
Ah, don't worry about it.
He's just an asshole.

260
00:16:20,912 --> 00:16:22,823
Well, listen, I'll-I'll make it up
to you somehow.

261
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:26,905
<i>Oh, I know. Hey, guess what's playing at the Rialto
on a double bill with In the Heat of the Night.</i>

262
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:30,223
<i>- Yeah? What's that?
- Bonnie and Clyde.</i>

263
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:32,189
Come on. We haven't seen it
in about 20 years.

264
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:35,901
- What do you say? You wanna go?
- Of course I want to go.

265
00:16:35,992 --> 00:16:39,826
Great. Okay, I'll see you
later then.

266
00:16:39,912 --> 00:16:41,903
All right, Clip.

267
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:45,826
Oh, and, Larry? You shouldn't
be talking to me anyway.

268
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:48,824
I mean, after all, you've got
a lot of boxes to count.

269
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:52,382
Thanks for reminding me, Clip.

270
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:55,509
Get outta here. Go to work.
What a jerk.

271
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,225
Excuse me.
Would you mind stepping back?

272
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,382
You wouldn't want me
to fork ya to death, would you?

273
00:17:05,072 --> 00:17:07,347
No. No.

274
00:17:07,432 --> 00:17:09,423
I mean, we couldn't have that.
I mean-

275
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:14,704
After all, you know,
we hardly know each other.

276
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:17,431
Since when does that matter?

277
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,507
All right, you,
get back to work.

278
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:26,628
I know what you're thinking.

279
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:30,148
Sometimes, I get the distinct feeling
I'm missin' out on something.

280
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:35,511
Well, what she's got,
she's got plenty you don't need.

281
00:17:35,592 --> 00:17:37,548
You sure?

282
00:17:39,112 --> 00:17:41,421
Not absolutely...

283
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:44,231
but if I ever tried to find out,
your mother would kill me.

284
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:48,106
You're the dad every kid dreams of.
You know that?

285
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,308
Ah, don't be such a wise guy.

286
00:17:50,392 --> 00:17:53,225
Listen, Petey Fleckman
just got canned.

287
00:17:53,312 --> 00:17:55,507
That's three guys since yesterday.

288
00:17:55,592 --> 00:17:57,583
Something stinks around here, kiddo...

289
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:00,140
and I don't mean the meat loaf special
in the cafeteria.

290
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:01,631
Ah, yeah, I know.

291
00:18:01,712 --> 00:18:04,670
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, look at this.

292
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:08,188
That's the same bunch
he had down here last week.

293
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:10,740
- Who are they?
- Who knows?

294
00:18:10,832 --> 00:18:12,948
Niles ',',Asshole" Pender's
trying to pass them off...

295
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:16,263
as some championship
baseball team from Osaka.

296
00:18:16,352 --> 00:18:20,470
When I talked to one of'em, he thinks mickey
mantle's something over a mouse's fireplace.

297
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:24,545
You're in management.
Check around a little bit, will ya?

298
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:27,192
Yeah. Okay, Pop, I'll see
what I can find out.

299
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,388
Ah, you're aces, kid.

300
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:37,388
Looking back, I should have
said no to Dad too, but I didn't.

301
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:40,509
I was beginning to think that
maybe something was going on.

302
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:48,388
I decided to look around Niles's office
to see if I could find anything.

303
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,708
I'd been an idiot
all morning anyway...

304
00:18:51,792 --> 00:18:53,783
so I figured,
why stop now?

305
00:19:27,912 --> 00:19:29,903
Shit.

306
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:46,061
',',Leveraged buyout
via metasport. "

307
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,143
What the hell's metasport?

308
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,943
Shit.

309
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:59,421
Why is it every time you
break into your boss's office...

310
00:19:59,512 --> 00:20:01,548
he always walks in on you?

311
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:05,948
Lose something, Burrows?

312
00:20:08,512 --> 00:20:10,582
Something tells me I have.

313
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,097
Well, that brings me back
to where I began-

314
00:20:18,188 --> 00:20:20,861
in the middle of nowhere
with a car that won't start.

315
00:20:22,108 --> 00:20:26,465
All things considered, it had
turned into a pretty rotten birthday.

316
00:20:31,868 --> 00:20:34,826
But nothing
in my wildest imagination...

317
00:20:34,908 --> 00:20:37,422
could have prepared me
for what came next.

318
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:56,303
- Evening.
- Hi.

319
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,744
- You got a pay phone?
- Right there.

320
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:02,137
Thanks.

321
00:21:13,868 --> 00:21:17,099
Yeah, hi.
It's me again.

322
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:19,782
Yeah, I'm gonna need
another tow.

323
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:22,826
Yeah. I'm on the corner
of Cross and Third...

00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,899
right next to a bar.

325
00:21:24,988 --> 00:21:28,105
Yeah, the station wagon-
the big blue piece of shit.

326
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,707
I'll get a new car.

327
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,858
All right.

328
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:38,907
',',Get a new car. "
Gotta get a new life.

329
00:21:38,988 --> 00:21:41,502
- Car trouble, huh?
- Yeah.

330
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:43,897
Tow truck will be here
in 20 minutes.

331
00:21:43,988 --> 00:21:46,707
- Get you something while you wait?
- I could sure use it.

332
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:49,939
Light beer, no glass. Right?

333
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:52,303
Yeah. How did you know?

334
00:21:52,388 --> 00:21:54,379
Just a guess.

335
00:21:57,308 --> 00:22:01,779
Say, don't I know you
from somewhere?

336
00:22:01,868 --> 00:22:05,178
- You know, you seem familiar to me too.
- Name's mike.

337
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:10,705
- Larry.
- Burrows. Larry Burrows, right?

338
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:14,861
You're the kid who lost the high school
championship in 1970.

339
00:22:14,948 --> 00:22:18,907
Jesus Henry Christ.

340
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:23,266
Sorry. If I'd known it was a sore point,
I wouldn't have brought it up.

341
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:29,900
Forget it.
I'm getting used to it.

342
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:32,024
Ah, this whole day's
been a nightmare.

343
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:36,147
- Care to talk about it? - Well,
it's- You know, it's lots of things.

344
00:22:36,228 --> 00:22:39,903
I didn't have
my cereal this morning.

345
00:22:39,988 --> 00:22:42,627
Didn't have my coffee at work.

346
00:22:42,708 --> 00:22:45,745
I got fired.

347
00:22:45,828 --> 00:22:49,298
It's my 35th birthday,
and everyone forgot.

348
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:52,505
Well, almost everyone.
I mean, I got vomit from Clip.

349
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:55,466
Well, happy birthday.

350
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:59,860
Thanks, mike. Yeah, 35 years old,
and my life is shit.

351
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:03,145
- It can't be all that bad.
- Ah, it's not that it's bad, you know?

352
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:05,298
It's just that it's ordinary.

353
00:23:06,388 --> 00:23:09,619
You know, I do
the same thing every day-

354
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:13,018
go to work, come home...

355
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:16,066
build some model cars
or go bowling...

356
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:18,423
fall asleep in front of the TV
every night.

357
00:23:20,348 --> 00:23:24,261
I don't know. If I'd just
hit that goddam ball...

358
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:27,658
my life would have turned out
a whole helluva lot better.

359
00:23:27,748 --> 00:23:32,663
Some people believe that things are
the way they are for a reason.

360
00:23:32,748 --> 00:23:34,704
Well, the reason eludes me, mike.

361
00:23:37,228 --> 00:23:39,344
Can I have another one?

362
00:23:39,428 --> 00:23:41,020
Listen...

363
00:23:42,068 --> 00:23:45,617
I've got just the thing
for a sober cynic like yourself.

364
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,901
It's a little something
of my own design.

365
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,784
I call it...

366
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,823
',',The Spilt milk. "

367
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:09,098
It's the one drink
there's no use crying over.

368
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:11,941
Oh. Very clever, mike.

369
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:14,940
It does the job. Try it.

370
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,620
So you really think your life
would have been better...

371
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,268
if you'd hit the ball, huh?

372
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,021
Yeah. A lot better.

373
00:24:33,948 --> 00:24:35,939
I swung too late.
That's all.

374
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:40,704
Yeah.

375
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:47,260
If I'd just started
a half a second sooner.

376
00:25:21,108 --> 00:25:23,702
I did it!
I did it!

377
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,984
Yeah!

378
00:25:34,188 --> 00:25:36,656
Half a second sooner,
and I would've been king.

379
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:42,142
A lousy half a second.

380
00:25:47,828 --> 00:25:51,343
Well, I think I'll go outside
and wait for the tow truck.

381
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:55,342
Thanks for
the sympathetic ear, mike.

382
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,784
Any time, Larry.
That's what I'm here for.

383
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,345
Oh, great.
They towed my car already.

384
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:13,577
You'd think they could've
at least come in and told me.

385
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,946
Is he closed already?

386
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:23,862
Ah, damn. Hey, mike!

387
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:26,667
mike, I need to call a cab!

388
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,460
It's paved.

389
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:49,057
Well, what do you know?

390
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,537
Old Guzelman
came through after all.

391
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:53,619
must've found a mud guy.

392
00:26:57,828 --> 00:26:59,978
Hey, Ellen?

393
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:03,185
Let me in, will ya?
I gotta use the can.

394
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:07,101
Come on, honey.
my key won't work. Let me in.

395
00:27:10,348 --> 00:27:13,146
What the hell are ya doin'
banging on my door like that?

396
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:15,537
Hey, who are you?
What's goin' on here?

397
00:27:15,628 --> 00:27:18,665
- What have you done with my wife?
- What are you talkin' about?

398
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:23,298
Hey, look, man, just take
whatever you need and leave.

399
00:27:23,388 --> 00:27:27,017
If you don't hurt anybody,
I won't call the cops, okay?

400
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:30,066
Cops? man, I am a cop.

401
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,184
Now, just what's
your problem, huh?

402
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:35,544
Well, I-I don't have a problem.
I- I live here.

403
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,664
Oh, what are you doing in my house?
Is something wrong?

404
00:27:37,748 --> 00:27:41,377
Your house? You better show me
some ID, pal, right now.

405
00:27:41,468 --> 00:27:43,459
Yeah, yeah. O-Okay.

406
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,417
Boy, you're gonna feel like a fool though.
I mean, I've lived here for over a year.

- Probably from the DmV, where everybody gets their licence.

410
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:03,297
Look, man, I don't care what this thing says.
This is my house, and I wanna see my wife.

411
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:07,825
- Now, step outta my way.
- You try and come in my house, and I'll kick your ass all the way down the block.

412
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:11,743
I don't care.
I'm coming in.

413

- We need to talk.

Yeah, yeah. In a minute.
I gotta get in my house.

418
00:28:26,308 --> 00:28:29,027
Uh, that's one of the things
we need to talk about.

419
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:33,101
- You don't live there any more.
- What?

420
00:28:33,188 --> 00:28:35,383
See? Even the cab driver
knows you don't live here.

421
00:28:35,468 --> 00:28:37,459
Now beat it!

422
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:44,696
It's all very simple really.

423
00:28:44,785 --> 00:28:48,937
You know that, uh, little incident
you didn't like about your life?

424
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:51,016
You mean the baseball game?

425
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:53,300
- It's been changed.
- Changed?

426
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:55,421
What do you mean ',',changed"?

427
00:28:55,505 --> 00:28:59,976
You hit the three-two pitch
right out of the park.

428
00:29:00,065 --> 00:29:02,056
And that's why I don't
live in my house any more?

429
00:29:02,145 --> 00:29:05,217
Exactly.
When that moment changed...

430
00:29:05,305 --> 00:29:07,899
everything else in your life
changed along with it.

431
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:13,542
I get it. I get it now.

432
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:16,185
Aw, this is great.
This is just great.

433
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:19,018
Wh-What did they
pay you for this, huh?

434
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,620
- What does who pay me, Larry?
- Ellen and Clipster.

435
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:26,141
They set this up, right? I mean, this is
some kind of birthday gag, right?

436
00:29:27,825 --> 00:29:29,816
This is really great.

437
00:29:29,905 --> 00:29:32,055
Hey, who was that big guy
at the house?

438
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,864
Is that another actor?
Boy, he was great.

439
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:36,936
Scared the shit outta me.

440
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,176
I- I don't think
you understand.

441
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:42,859
No. No, no, no. Shh, shh.
I don't wanna hear a thing.

442
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:44,936
I just wanna
play along with it, okay?

443
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:49,053
Oh, this is great.
So, mike, you do this a lot?

444
00:29:49,145 --> 00:29:51,784
I mean, you know,
change people's lives and stuff.

445
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:54,857
I've been known to make
a few adjustments now and again.

446
00:30:10,345 --> 00:30:12,734
This is it?
I live in a hotel, huh?

447
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:15,293
It's a private home,
and it's all yours.

448
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:18,263
Yeah, right, mike.
Hey, listen...

449
00:30:18,345 --> 00:30:20,301
why don't you wait here
till I get to the door.

450
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:24,378
- You wouldn't wanna miss the expression on my face, would ya?
- Not for all the world.

451
00:30:24,465 --> 00:30:26,979
Here. I assume you're taken care of,
but there's another five for ya.

452
00:30:27,065 --> 00:30:29,101
You were really great.

453
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:34,297
Wow. This must've
cost them a fortune.

454
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:48,258
I'm here at the door
to my new home.

455
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:55,383
Hi. I'm Larry Burrows, but you
probably already know that, right?

00:30:55,465 --> 00:30:57,456
Y- Yes, of course, sir.

457
00:30:57,545 --> 00:30:59,820
Yeah. Is my wife here?

00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:02,783
- As if I didn't know.
- Yes, of course she is.

459
00:31:07,025 --> 00:31:10,176
Wow. Nice set-up.

460
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:14,019
I didn't know you could rent
places like this for parties. Huh.

461
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:17,336
- Hey, what's your name?
- Why, it's Boswell, sir.

I'm gonna be.

It's me!

470
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:46,704
Darling, you're home.
I was so worried.

471
00:31:46,785 --> 00:31:51,495
- Daddy, Daddy! Did you bring us something?
- What did you bring us?

472
00:31:51,585 --> 00:31:54,179
Where have you been?
Ludwig went to pick you up...

473
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,904
- but they said you'd already left.
- Cindy Jo.

474
00:31:56,985 --> 00:32:01,740
What are you doing here? Uh, are you in on this too? W
- Where's Clip and Ellen?

475
00:32:01,825 --> 00:32:05,943
Who are Clip and Ellen? What are you
talking about, sweetheart? In on what?

476
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:09,938
- m-my surprise birthday party. - The
party isn't for another two hours, dear...

477
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:12,858
and you told me you didn't want it to be
a surprise because you hate surprises.

478
00:32:21,465 --> 00:32:23,535
Darling, what's wrong?

479
00:32:23,625 --> 00:32:26,219
Nothing is wrong.

480
00:32:29,945 --> 00:32:32,664
Will you excuse me a minute?

481
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:48,538
mike! mike.

482
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,298
Okay, mike,
what the hell is goin' on?

483
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:56,618
Why is Cindy Jo calling me ',',sweetheart," who are those kids and
- and what is this place?

484
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,980
This is your house.
Those are your children.

485
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:01,056
Cindy Jo's your wife.

486
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:06,214
No!

487
00:33:06,305 --> 00:33:08,136
Yes.

488
00:33:12,945 --> 00:33:17,018
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not all right.

489
00:33:17,105 --> 00:33:20,063
I mean, this kind of thing
doesn't happen every day, you know?

490
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:22,739
Yes, it is quite remarkable,
if I do say so myself.

491
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:24,816
Wait. I don't understand
any of this.

492
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:29,456
How can my life change so much just
because I hit one stinkin' baseball?

493
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:33,174
Well, you see, Larry, one's destiny
is a very complicated thing.

494
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:37,418
Every incident in a person's life...

495
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:39,973
affects everything else
that follows it.

496
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:44,058
Instead of missing the baseball,
however, you hit it.

497
00:33:44,145 --> 00:33:47,103
Then you became a hero,
married the prom queen...

498
00:33:47,185 --> 00:33:49,779
and so on and so forth...

499
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:54,381
until you find yourself
exactly where you are.

500
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:58,060
So you see,
hitting that baseball...

501
00:33:58,145 --> 00:34:02,661
has spun your life off
in an entirely new direction.

502
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:07,334
Are you an angel
or something?

503
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:10,303
Not exactly, no.

504
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:12,740
Th-Then what are you?

505
00:34:14,145 --> 00:34:16,500
Have you ever been
faced with a decision...

506
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:20,180
- and you weren't sure what to do?
- Yeah. Sure, plenty of times.

507
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:24,781
And then something inside you made you
choose one direction over another?

508
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:28,619
- Yeah. So?
- So that's me.

509
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:32,459
I make the suggestions,
and you make the choices.

510
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:37,778
That's how destiny works, Larry-
very subtly.

511
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,821
Welcome to your new life, Larry.

512
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:43,336
I hope you like it.

513
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:49,264
mike.
Hey, wait a second.

514
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,176
mike. mike, hey!

515
00:34:51,265 --> 00:34:53,984
mike! mike!

516
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,859
What am I supposed
to do now?

517
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:21,500
Hi. It's me again. Larry Burrows.

518
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,621
Why did you run
out of the house, sweetheart?

519
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,058
Um...

520
00:35:29,145 --> 00:35:32,137
I forgot to, uh,
tip the cabbie.

521
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:36,104
You took a cab?
Why didn't you wait for Ludwig?

522
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:38,221
Ludwig?

523
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:43,253
Oh, Ludwig.
Oh, good old Ludwig.

524
00:35:44,265 --> 00:35:46,904
I didn't wait
for Ludwig because...

525
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:51,456
I can't remember his...

526
00:35:51,545 --> 00:35:54,013
face.

527
00:35:55,505 --> 00:35:58,144
You must be very tired,
sweetheart.

528
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:00,261
Yes.

529
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:04,497
Why don't you go into the library and
have yourself a nice drink before dinner.

530
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,496
Okay.

531
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:15,104
Uh, by the way,
where's the library?

532
00:36:17,465 --> 00:36:19,456
It's over there.

533
00:36:20,985 --> 00:36:24,421
Great. Yeah. Thanks.

534
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:33,735
So, I'll just
be in the library...

535
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,385
having a drink.

536
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,376
Thanks again.

537
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,377
Geez.

538
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:52,904
I must belong
to the Book-of-the-month Club.

539
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,821
Oh, Boswell!
How you doin'?

540
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:21,022
Am I glad to see you.
How are you?

541
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:24,939
- Your evening drink, sir.
- Oh, good.

542
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:28,620
- What is it?
- Armagnac. 1953.

543
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,902
Whoa. I think I'm gonna
pass on that, Bos.

544
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,294
But you know what I could use is
a nice cold brewski.

545
00:37:36,385 --> 00:37:39,502
- I'm parched.
- A ',',brewski," sir?

546
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,177
Yeah, a light if you've got it.
No glass.

547
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:44,098
And listen, Boswell, can you tell me
where the can is in this place?

548
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:46,983
I had a couple of drinks after work.
You know what I mean?

549
00:37:47,065 --> 00:37:49,738
- The ',',can," sir?
- Yeah, yeah. The bathroom.

550
00:37:49,825 --> 00:37:53,135
Well, sir,
there are 15 bathrooms.

551
00:37:53,225 --> 00:37:55,455
Fifteen bathrooms?

552
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:58,343
Did you have
any particular one in mind, sir?

553
00:37:58,425 --> 00:38:01,258
No. No, I don't need
nothin' special.

554
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,940
Just, you know,
the nearest one will do.

555
00:38:05,025 --> 00:38:09,143
Through that door, sir,
down the hall.

556
00:38:09,225 --> 00:38:11,375
Thank you.

557
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:15,376
Brewski.

558
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,535
A closet.

559
00:38:25,865 --> 00:38:27,776
Another closet.

560
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:33,621
It's a closet. There's 15 bathrooms in
this place. You'd think I could find one.

561
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,538
maybe this is it.

562
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:03,385
my God, I've died
and gone to heaven.

563
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:08,341
Excuse me. Sir?

564
00:39:08,425 --> 00:39:11,019
Would you like to go for a ride
before dinner?

565
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:16,582
Oh, no, no. No. Thanks.
Thanks, anyway.

566
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:21,580
Hey, tell me somethin'.
Who do these cars belong to?

567
00:39:21,665 --> 00:39:24,463
Well, they-they belong
to you, sir.

568
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:27,378
- Get the hell outta here!
- As you wish, sir.

569
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:49,933
Hey. Wow.

570
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:52,617
A big hunk of cheese.

571
00:39:52,703 --> 00:39:56,252
It's just what I wanted.

572
00:39:56,343 --> 00:40:00,222
- It's, uh, it's Stilton, LJ.
- Well, thank you, mr Stilton.

573
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:03,773
I'm sure it goes great with, uh, tomato
and mayonnaise and pumpernickel.

574
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,900
Thank you, everyone, so much
for remembering my birthday.

575
00:40:08,983 --> 00:40:12,658
The gifts are terrific, really.
Thank you again, mr Stilton.

576
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,497
- And you, too, mr Steuben, for the big hunk of glass there.
- my pleasure, LJ.

577
00:40:19,863 --> 00:40:21,979
Hey, LJ.

578
00:40:22,063 --> 00:40:25,260
- LJ. LJ.
- Dad, you're here.

579
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:28,892
many happy returns, kid.
Swell shindig!

580
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:31,702
Say hello to Gina.
Gina, my kid.

581
00:40:31,783 --> 00:40:33,660
Very nice to make
your acquaintance.

582
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:36,735
We made our acquaintance in morocco
at the Club med...

583
00:40:36,823 --> 00:40:39,735
if you know what I mean.

584
00:40:39,823 --> 00:40:43,099
Um, will, uh, you excuse us
for a moment, please?

585
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:47,938
- Ah. Why don't you go have some more caviar, sweetie?
- Okay.

586
00:40:50,103 --> 00:40:52,253
Very nice to have met you, LJ.

587
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:01,572
She loves caviar.
Thinks it's salty candy.

588
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:04,655
I haven't told her
it's fish eggs.

589
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:08,816
Are you crazy, Dad,
bringing that girl in here?

590
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:11,701
What if mom found out?
She'd skin you alive!

591
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,616
Relax. We signed
the papers a week ago.

592
00:41:14,703 --> 00:41:18,093
I'm free and clear now. Now, what do
you think of Gina? Hot stuff, huh?

593
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:19,741
Papers? What papers?

594
00:41:19,823 --> 00:41:22,656
- The divorce papers.
- Divo-

595
00:41:22,743 --> 00:41:24,335
You and mom are divorced?

596
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:27,733
Of course we're divorced.
Nothing lasts forever.

597
00:41:27,823 --> 00:41:30,132
You told me so yourself.

598
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:32,691
- I said that?
- Yeah. You were right too.

599
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:35,343
Listen, kid,
can you spot me ten grand?

600
00:41:35,423 --> 00:41:38,938
Gina's been killin' me
to take her to St. Bart's, okay?

601
00:41:39,023 --> 00:41:41,014
You're aces, kid.

602
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:53,095
Larry, darling. Your guests
are wondering if you're all right.

603
00:41:53,183 --> 00:41:57,176
- What's the matter, dear?
- my parents are divorced.

604
00:41:57,263 --> 00:42:01,620
Of course they are, sweetheart.
Everybody's parents are divorced.

605
00:42:01,703 --> 00:42:04,297
Now go and be a good host.

606
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:09,731
Excuse me a moment,
will you, Cindy Jo?

607
00:42:15,023 --> 00:42:17,662
You didn't tell me
my parents were divorced.

608
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,938
This is quite good caviar.

609
00:42:20,023 --> 00:42:22,139
mike, my parents are divorced,
for Christ's sake!

610
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:25,932
- Yes, I know.
- Well, I didn't expect that.

611
00:42:28,663 --> 00:42:30,779
Is there anything else
that's gonna come as a shock?

612
00:42:32,023 --> 00:42:34,014
It all will, to some degree.

613
00:42:34,103 --> 00:42:36,617
- To what degree?
- You'll see.

614
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:40,821
Things have changed, Larry. You have
to take the bad with the good.

615
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:44,054
You didn't think everything
was gonna be perfect, did you?

616
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,862
Well, I-

617
00:42:46,943 --> 00:42:49,138
I- I suppose not.

618
00:42:49,223 --> 00:42:53,341
This is your life, Larry.

619
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:56,654
Learn to enjoy
what you've got.

620
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:11,895
A brewski, sir?

621
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:13,575
Good night.

622
00:43:13,663 --> 00:43:16,496
- Bye-bye. -
Good night. - Wow.

623
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:18,699
I've got some great friends,
don't you think?

624
00:43:18,783 --> 00:43:21,343
They give terrific gifts!

625
00:43:21,423 --> 00:43:23,778
You still have
one more present coming.

626
00:43:30,743 --> 00:43:32,779
I'll see you upstairs.

627
00:43:43,423 --> 00:43:45,300
Cindy Jo?

628
00:43:47,183 --> 00:43:49,174
Are you in here?

629
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,415
Larry, I'm over here.

630
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:17,542
Happy birthday, darling.

631
00:44:17,623 --> 00:44:19,454
God help me.

632
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,977
morning, Bos.
Sleep well?

633
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,054
I didn't,
if you know what I mean.

634
00:44:42,143 --> 00:44:45,021
I know exactly
what you mean, sir.

635
00:44:45,103 --> 00:44:48,095
Oh, this house has
a lot of big rooms.

636
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:52,015
Oh.

637
00:44:53,303 --> 00:44:55,453
Isn't this a little drab
for such a happy guy?

638
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:59,058
Oh, you always wear your blue pinstripe
to board meetings, sir.

639
00:44:59,143 --> 00:45:00,895
Board meetings?

640
00:45:00,983 --> 00:45:04,578
Son of a bitch. That's right.
I'm married to Cindy Jo.

641
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:08,661
That means I'm the president
of Liberty Republic.

642
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:11,416
Indeed, sir.
For some time now.

643
00:45:12,703 --> 00:45:16,252
Oh, yeah.
I mean, uh, I knew that.

644
00:45:16,343 --> 00:45:20,973
I'm just so happy about it that I like
to remind myself every so often, Bos.

645
00:45:29,383 --> 00:45:32,534
Yeah. Oh.

646
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:39,662
- Good morning, kids. - morning,
Father. - morning, Father.

647
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:44,372
Ah, crescent rolls.

648
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,102
Very nice.

649
00:45:47,183 --> 00:45:49,253
Very nice indeed.

650
00:45:52,503 --> 00:45:55,142
Larry Burrows. How you doin'?
Nice to meet you.

651
00:45:58,943 --> 00:46:02,697
- What's this, Cream of Wheat?
- It's cappuccino, Daddy.

652
00:46:02,783 --> 00:46:06,173
Italian dark roast coffee
and steamed whole milk.

653
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,379
Right, I knew that.

654
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,419
Whoa! That'll keep you up
the rest of your life! Huh?

655
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:21,332
That's nice stuff. You sure you kids
should be drinking this?

656
00:46:21,423 --> 00:46:23,573
We always do, Daddy.

657
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,451
Well, I guess
it's all right then.

658
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:32,058
- morning.
- Hi.

659
00:46:32,143 --> 00:46:34,099
You were wonderful
last night.

660
00:46:36,183 --> 00:46:38,094
So were you.

661
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:40,651
I had no idea you could
do that with Cool Whip.

662
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,996
Wow!

663
00:46:52,084 --> 00:46:54,518
I told you we could beat that train
through the crossing, didn't I, Ludwig?

664
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,834
So you did, sir.

665
00:46:56,924 --> 00:47:00,200
Give yourself a raise, Ludwig.
Hundred bucks a week!

666
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,275
You're all right.

667
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:11,077
Wow.

668
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,400
This is my office?

669
00:47:21,044 --> 00:47:23,319
This will take
some getting used to.

670
00:47:31,604 --> 00:47:33,959
Nice desk.

671
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:39,515
I wonder how it works.

672
00:47:41,604 --> 00:47:44,243
There's gotta be
an ',',on" switch here somewhere.

673
00:47:49,004 --> 00:47:52,235
How about that?
The desk is wired to my ass.

674
00:47:57,004 --> 00:47:58,995
<i>- Good morning, Mr Burrows.
- Um-</i>

675
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>- Oh. Hi. How are you?
- Can I get you something, sir?</i>

676
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:07,638
No. No, I'm fine.
Oh, coffee!

677
00:48:07,724 --> 00:48:09,954
You know, I-I'd really like
a cup of coffee.

678
00:48:10,044 --> 00:48:14,401
<i>Yes, sir. Right away. And Mr Pender and Mr
Flick are on their way up to see you, sir.</i>

679
00:48:14,484 --> 00:48:16,202
You're kidding.
Those jerks still work here?

680
00:48:16,284 --> 00:48:20,596
<i>- I beg your pardon? - Uh,
nothing. Uh, nothing-nothing at all.</i>

681
00:48:20,684 --> 00:48:23,118
Say, listen,
can you do me a favour?

682
00:48:23,204 --> 00:48:27,914
Could you find out if Clip metzler
or Ellen Burr- Ripley-

683
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:29,995
Ellen Ripley work here?

684
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:33,156
<i>I know Mr Metzler works in accounting,
but I'll have to check on Ellen Ripley.</i>

685
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,316
Thanks. Oh, and tell Pender
and Flick that, uh-

686
00:48:36,404 --> 00:48:38,634
Uh, I'm- I can't be disturbed.
I'm too busy.

687
00:48:38,724 --> 00:48:42,876
<i>- You know, I got lots of buttons to push and stuff.
- Yes, sir.</i>

688
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:44,955
Over and out.

689
00:48:51,684 --> 00:48:53,276
Let's see.

690
00:48:53,364 --> 00:48:57,152
There's a bar in here?
Where's the bar?

691
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:03,596
Wow. I'm gonna love this place.

692
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:10,034
All right, Lar.
The good stuff.

693
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:21,753
Hey. I know you.
You're the forklift girl, right?

694
00:49:21,844 --> 00:49:24,039
Oh, great. Thanks.

695
00:49:24,124 --> 00:49:27,560
I've been trying to get
a regular cup of coffee for days.

696
00:49:27,644 --> 00:49:30,920
Then again, maybe I don't need
any coffee after all.

697
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:33,154
Just where the hell
were you last night?

698
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:36,634
I waited up until midnight,
and then I went to bed- alone.

699
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:40,512
I- I'm sorry. Um, um-

700
00:49:40,604 --> 00:49:43,721
Jewel! It's Jewel! Have you
forgotten my name already?

701
00:49:43,804 --> 00:49:47,433
Jewel. Right, I knew that.

702
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:50,118
Look, I'm-I'm real, real sorry.

703
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,160
I- I guess I couldn't make it.

704
00:49:52,244 --> 00:49:54,963
- I-I had this party to go to-
- You guess you couldn't make it?

705
00:49:55,044 --> 00:49:57,478
Where were you,
out with this Ellen Ripley bitch?

706
00:49:57,564 --> 00:49:59,680
Oh, Ellen. Did you find out
if she works here?

707
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:02,324
No, she does not
work here.

708
00:50:02,404 --> 00:50:06,602
If she suddenly starts working here,
you're gonna live to regret it.

709
00:50:06,684 --> 00:50:08,720
Say,Jewel, what do you say
we double your salary.

710
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:12,717
- How's that?
- I know what you're capable of, LJ Burrows.

711
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:14,795
Just don't mess with me...

712
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:18,115
or you're gonna find out
what I'm capable of.

713
00:50:18,204 --> 00:50:21,401
Am I making myself
perfectly clear?

714
00:50:23,324 --> 00:50:29,513
- Uh... perfectly.
- Uh, LJ, we need to talk. Whoa.

715
00:50:29,604 --> 00:50:31,595
Oh, hi, guys.
Come on in.

716
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:36,397
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Uh, it's about the New Jersey plan.

717
00:50:36,484 --> 00:50:38,793
I gotta call Bob and let him know
one way or another.

718
00:50:38,884 --> 00:50:43,036
I think it's a big mistake
to set up New Jersey, LJ. Big mistake.

719
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:45,354
LJ, we really need to talk in private
about the country club.

720
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:49,278
We have to go over a few points on the Nakamura deal
before we sign the papers tomorrow night? Are we on?

721
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:52,242
- For New Jersey?
- No, for golf.

722
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:57,038
Excuse me, LJ.
Am I disturbing you?

723
00:50:57,124 --> 00:50:59,479
mr Hansen, come in.

724
00:51:01,404 --> 00:51:04,441
Come in. mr Hansen.

725
00:51:04,524 --> 00:51:07,402
Come on in, please.

726
00:51:07,484 --> 00:51:08,917
What can I do for you,
mr Hansen?

727
00:51:09,004 --> 00:51:14,078
Well, I just wanted to apologize for not
appearing at your birthday party last night.

728
00:51:14,164 --> 00:51:17,042
- my ulcer was acting up, and I
just thought- - Oh, don't mention it.

729
00:51:17,124 --> 00:51:20,560
You didn't miss a thing.
I- I got some cheese and a glass thing.

730
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,680
- A what?
- You know, this, um-

731
00:51:22,764 --> 00:51:24,755
Uh, excuse me. LJ?

732
00:51:24,844 --> 00:51:28,883
Sir, we really should get going.
We, uh, tee off in 15 minutes.

733
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:33,515
Oh, right. Yeah, well, uh-

734
00:51:33,604 --> 00:51:35,913
Hey, mr Hansen, would you like
to come golfing with us?

735
00:51:36,004 --> 00:51:38,393
- I play golf, you
know. - Really? - Yeah.

736
00:51:38,484 --> 00:51:42,193
- You want to play golf with me?
- Sure, I wanna play golf with you. Come on.

737
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:46,197
- You know, I can help you get rid of that
slice or... - Uh-huh. - whatever you call it, uh-

738
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,162
Yeah.

739
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,634
It slipped.

740
00:52:09,964 --> 00:52:12,159
Can I use yours?

741
00:52:12,244 --> 00:52:14,678
- Sure.
- Thanks.

742
00:52:16,324 --> 00:52:18,315
It's not like
a baseball bat, you know.

743
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,720
That was dirt.

744
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:30,272
- That'll grow back, right?
- We'll fix it.

745
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:32,355
This is the real one.

746
00:52:42,324 --> 00:52:44,599
- It's not supposed to go over there, is it?
- Well, no, sir.

747
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:48,643
Um, actually, it's supposed to go
in the hole... on the green.

748
00:52:48,724 --> 00:52:51,841
Oh. All right.
Hey, Leo, come on.

749
00:52:51,924 --> 00:52:54,199
Let's take the golf cart
and see if we can find the ball.

750
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:56,718
I don't get it.

751
00:52:56,804 --> 00:52:59,364
What are you,
deaf, dumb and blind?

752
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:03,039
The Jerry Lewis routine is to lull the old
geezer into a false sense of security...

753
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:05,592
before he sells the company
out from under him.

754
00:53:05,684 --> 00:53:09,074
It's brilliant.
It's my idea.

755
00:53:11,164 --> 00:53:12,756
Uh-huh.

756
00:53:21,444 --> 00:53:23,799
Hey, how you doin'?

757
00:53:23,884 --> 00:53:25,840
Good to see ya.

758
00:53:25,924 --> 00:53:28,279
Hey, you're doing a great job,
and I just want you to know that.

759
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:30,355
Keep up the good work, guys.

760
00:53:31,604 --> 00:53:33,595
What's with him?

761
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:38,839
I'm the president of the company. I should
do something about this line, don't you think?

762
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:47,715
Oh, my God.

763
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,436
Ellen.

764
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,357
Ellen. It's me, Larry.

765
00:53:55,444 --> 00:53:58,038
Oh, my God.
Am I glad to see you.

766
00:53:58,124 --> 00:54:01,434
Oh. I've been wondering
where you were.

767
00:54:01,524 --> 00:54:04,516
- I beg your pardon?
- You know, they told me you didn't work here.

768
00:54:04,604 --> 00:54:08,233
I couldn't find you. There's no record of an Ellen
Ripley, and I knew it wouldn't be under Burrows.

769
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:12,203
Why would it be under Burrows?
my name is Robertson.

770
00:54:12,284 --> 00:54:15,401
Robertson?
What are you doin' with that name?

771
00:54:15,484 --> 00:54:19,238
It is customary for a woman to take
her husband's name, mr Burrows.

772
00:54:19,324 --> 00:54:21,315
Now, if you'll excuse me.

773
00:54:25,284 --> 00:54:27,115
You're married?
When did that happen?

774
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:30,321
Six years ago. Don't worry.
I wasn't married on company time.

775
00:54:30,404 --> 00:54:34,363
Wait. Wait. You just married
the first guy that came along?

776
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:37,356
Look, just because I work for you
does not give you the right...

777
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,435
to pry into my private life.

778
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:44,641
Well, of course it doesn't.

779
00:54:44,724 --> 00:54:47,192
I'm just concerned...

780
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:51,038
as I am about, you know,
all my employees, miss, uh...

781
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,115
mrs Robertson.

782
00:54:53,204 --> 00:54:57,117
Concern for your employees has never
been your strong suit, mr Burrows.

783
00:54:57,204 --> 00:55:00,162
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to eat my lunch...

784
00:55:00,244 --> 00:55:02,394
by myself.

785
00:55:02,484 --> 00:55:05,476
Yeah, but, uh, couldn't we just-

786
00:55:19,164 --> 00:55:21,359
You really must
do something...

787
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:24,402
about this meat loaf, Larry.

788
00:55:24,484 --> 00:55:27,521
It is absolutely inedible.

789
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:31,517
- Ellen's married.
- Yes, I know.

790
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:35,675
She's mad at me.
I can tell.

791
00:55:35,764 --> 00:55:37,755
She's the union shop steward...

792
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:40,074
and the union's upset
over all the layoffs...

793
00:55:40,164 --> 00:55:42,997
the increased workload,
pay freezes.

794
00:55:43,084 --> 00:55:48,477
- So what's that got to do with me?
- You are the president of the company, their mortal enemy.

795
00:55:48,564 --> 00:55:51,442
- Yeah, but I wouldn't lay anybody off.
- But you did.

796
00:55:51,524 --> 00:55:55,597
And so, Ellen hates your guts.

797
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:58,676
She hates my personal guts?

798
00:55:58,764 --> 00:56:01,232
You'll find a lot of people
don't like you, Larry.

799
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,918
What am I gonna do? I mean, I can't have
her hating my guts all over the place.

800
00:56:04,004 --> 00:56:08,236
- I mean, she's my wife, for Christ's sake.
- She was your wife.

801
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:11,282
I have to go now.
This meat loaf is making me sick.

802
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,753
What am I gonna do
about Ellen?

803
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:16,722
Whatever you do
will be fine.

804
00:56:18,364 --> 00:56:20,958
You're a big help.

805
00:56:33,242 --> 00:56:35,710
Hey, I think it's busted, pal.

806
00:56:37,922 --> 00:56:39,833
- Clip, it's you!
- Oh, my God.

807
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:42,994
- mr Burrows, sir.
- Don't call me ',',sir," Clip.

808
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:46,358
It's me, Lar. Aw, come here
and give me a hug.

809
00:56:46,442 --> 00:56:48,398
Come here. God, I miss you,
you know that?

810
00:56:48,482 --> 00:56:50,677
It was an accident.
I swear I'll pay for any damages.

811
00:56:50,762 --> 00:56:53,196
Oh, forget about it. Come on. I wanna
kiss you on the top of your head.

812
00:56:53,282 --> 00:56:58,117
Come here. Clip! Clip!

813
00:56:58,202 --> 00:57:00,158
What's the matter with you?

814
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:03,518
Clipster, it's me, Larry.

815
00:57:17,473 --> 00:57:19,941
Larry, we're going to be late.

816
00:57:21,153 --> 00:57:24,509
What on earth are you doing?

817
00:57:24,593 --> 00:57:27,153
I don't feel like going
to the opera tonight, honey.

818
00:57:27,233 --> 00:57:30,031
I never really cared for it
that much, to tell you the truth-

819
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:33,071
all that hollering in Italian.

820
00:57:33,153 --> 00:57:37,829
- What's that?
- This is a Gullwing mercedes.

821
00:57:37,913 --> 00:57:40,985
- Pretty, isn't it?
- Yes, dear.

822
00:57:41,073 --> 00:57:43,633
You have one in the garage.

823
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:47,592
Yeah, but that one's too big.
I kinda like 'em smaller.

824
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:50,824
Children, you go wait
in the car, okay? Go on.

825
00:57:54,313 --> 00:57:56,702
- Darling?
- Hmm?

826
00:57:56,793 --> 00:57:59,387
Are you all right?

827
00:57:59,473 --> 00:58:02,829
You've been acting
very strange lately.

828
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:07,225
No. I'm fine. Really.

829
00:58:07,313 --> 00:58:10,749
Why don't you guys go ahead without me.
Have a good time.

830
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,142
I just wanna finish this up.

831
00:58:34,873 --> 00:58:38,149
I can't believe
Ellen married another guy.

832
00:58:52,593 --> 00:58:54,504
Wow. Nice house.

833
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:58,062
It's better
than the one we had.

834
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:05,706
I just wanted to borrow some cutlery,
Ellen, okay? I have no cutlery. None!

835
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:08,751
All I'm asking for is a couple
of lousy knives and forks.

836
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:11,028
Why don't you ask your girlfriend
for a knife and fork...

837
00:59:11,113 --> 00:59:13,069
or does the little bitch
eat with her fingers?

838
00:59:13,153 --> 00:59:18,511
I made a mistake,
and I'm very sorry for it.

839
00:59:18,593 --> 00:59:21,312
Now, can we try
and put all this behind us?

840
00:59:23,873 --> 00:59:26,307
Attagirl!

841
00:59:26,393 --> 00:59:28,304
Guess not.

842
00:59:38,113 --> 00:59:41,947
This is good.
This is very good.

843
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,303
Ow!

844
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:23,032
What's the matter, Hercules?

845
01:00:23,113 --> 01:00:26,992
You wanna go out?
Okay. Okay. Come on.

846
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:31,271
Come on! Come on.

847
01:00:38,353 --> 01:00:41,584
Shoo! Get away.

848
01:00:41,673 --> 01:00:43,709
Go on! Scram! Beat it!

849
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:46,387
Go rescue some skiers in the Alps
or somethin'. Go! Scram!

850
01:00:52,793 --> 01:00:55,466
Well, we'll see
who falls asleep first.

851
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:02,424
Asshole.

852
01:01:09,393 --> 01:01:11,384
Ow! Ow!

853
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:18,784
Stupid dog.

854
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:20,864
Stupid tree.

855
01:01:44,953 --> 01:01:47,751
- Good morning, chief.
- What's going on here?

856
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:52,384
- Who is that? - I don't know.
Some, uh, lunatic named, uh-

857
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:54,987
- Now, what's his name, huh?
- Uh, metzbaum, metsfield. I don't know.

858
01:01:55,073 --> 01:01:58,145
- He's in accounting.
- metzler?

859
01:01:58,233 --> 01:02:00,463
- Clip metzler?
- Yeah.

860
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:03,989
- He's threatening to jump.
- Aw,Jesus, Clip!

861
01:02:23,473 --> 01:02:25,384
Clip? What are you doing?

862
01:02:25,473 --> 01:02:29,591
Hey, you stay back, mr Burrows.
You get any closer, I'll jump.

863
01:02:29,673 --> 01:02:32,392
Okay, Clip. I'm not-
I'm not gonna come any closer.

864
01:02:32,473 --> 01:02:36,022
I just wanna talk.

865
01:02:36,113 --> 01:02:39,389
You know, if there's something wrong,
maybe I can help.

866
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:42,909
Well, i-i-it's a little late
for that, mr Burrows.

867
01:02:42,993 --> 01:02:45,712
You know, my whole life's
been a disaster.

868
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:48,466
Nothing I do ever works out.

869
01:02:49,553 --> 01:02:52,465
After what happened yesterday, well,
I know you're gonna fire me.

870
01:02:52,553 --> 01:02:56,341
Now, look, Clip.
I'm not gonna fire you.

871
01:02:56,433 --> 01:02:58,469
All right?

872
01:02:58,553 --> 01:03:02,148
In fact, you know what?
I came up here to offer you a new job.

873
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:06,306
How 'bout vice president?
Hundred twenty-five to start.

874
01:03:06,393 --> 01:03:08,463
- Really?
- Yeah. Really.

875
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:20,750
Oh, I get it.

876
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,745
Oh, I get it. You're just trying to
trick me. As soon as I get down there...

877
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:28,111
th- there's no job
and I'm off to the funny farm.

878
01:03:28,193 --> 01:03:32,027
- Don't try to kid me, mr Burrows.
- I'm not kidding, Clip.

879
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:37,750
Nothing will happen. I mean it.

880
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:40,301
Why else would
I come up here myself?

881
01:03:40,393 --> 01:03:43,988
I don't know.
Why did you come up here?

882
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:46,587
Because we're friends, Clip.

883
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:52,142
Hey, remember back in the eighth grade
when we used to hang around together?

884
01:03:52,233 --> 01:03:54,269
Remember, we used to throw rubber vomit
in the girls' locker room...

885
01:03:54,353 --> 01:03:56,821
and they'd come runnin' out
in their underwear?

886
01:03:56,913 --> 01:03:59,586
- You remember that?
- Yeah. Of course I do!

887
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:02,233
<i>Remember when we went to see
Bonnie and Clyde nine times...</i>

888
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:04,508
and we squirted ketchup
on ourselves and-

889
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:07,061
and ran all over the place
dying in slow motion?

890
01:04:09,073 --> 01:04:11,223
That was fun.

891
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:16,467
It scared the crap
out of my baby sister.

892
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,509
Yeah. And I remember how...

893
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:21,824
you used to always try
to make me laugh when I felt rotten.

894
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:30,389
Well, I-I- I didn't think that
you thought about that stuff any more.

895
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,828
Aw, Clip...

896
01:04:34,113 --> 01:04:36,991
I think about that stuff
all the time.

897
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:45,946
All right, Clipper. I want you
to go home. I want you to relax...

898
01:04:46,033 --> 01:04:49,628
have a nice meal,
shave, shower, get some sleep.

899
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:53,626
All right? Tomorrow,
you start your new job, new salary.

900
01:04:53,713 --> 01:04:56,352
- Thanks, mr Burrows.
- All right. Take care of yourself.

901
01:04:56,433 --> 01:04:58,389
Be careful.

902
01:04:58,473 --> 01:05:00,509
Pender.

903
01:05:00,593 --> 01:05:05,064
Well done, LJ.
Want me to fire him?

904
01:05:05,153 --> 01:05:08,350
No. I don't want
you to fire him.

905
01:05:08,433 --> 01:05:10,549
I want you
to get him a new mercedes...

906
01:05:10,633 --> 01:05:13,386
'cause a senior vice president
of East Coast sales...

907
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:15,941
can't be seen in anything less.

908
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:20,743
mercedes? LJ,
I didn't even get a mercedes.

909
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,427
Oh, and while you're at it,
I want you to get the board together...

910
01:05:23,513 --> 01:05:25,424
for a full meeting in ten minutes.

911
01:05:25,513 --> 01:05:28,311
We're gonna put an end to this
strike bullshit once and for all.

912
01:05:28,393 --> 01:05:32,750
- But L-L-LJ- - Hey, I don't have a problem
with that, Pender. You got a problem with that?

913
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:38,229
Well, do you, Pender?

914
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:41,544
No, sir. No problem.

915
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:44,067
I didn't think so.

916
01:05:57,113 --> 01:06:00,628
I just finished reading
the latest contract demands...

917
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:04,342
and... they seem very reasonable
to me.

918
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:08,550
- Reasonable? Um, but LJ-
- In fact-

919
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,864
In fact, I'm prepared to agree to all
of them under one condition...

920
01:06:13,713 --> 01:06:15,988
that the head of the negotiating
committee meet with me alone...

921
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:18,507
to go over the final details.

922
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:27,666
- Perhaps over dinner tonight?
- LJ, there are a few things you seem to be forgetting about.

923
01:06:27,753 --> 01:06:31,507
Dinner? I don't know why
that would be necessary.

924
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:35,302
It would be strictly business. You want
to bring this dispute to an end, don't you?

925
01:06:35,393 --> 01:06:38,510
Well, yes. Of course I do.

926
01:06:38,593 --> 01:06:40,902
I'll pick you up at 8:00.
How's that?

927
01:06:40,993 --> 01:06:43,223
LJ, I don't think
we should be so hasty.

928
01:06:44,753 --> 01:06:48,143
- Okay.
- Good. It's a date.

929
01:06:56,793 --> 01:06:58,021
I'm gonna nail this bastard.

930
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,583
Oh, oh. Don't do that, mike.

931
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,945
Congratulations, Larry.

932
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:15,306
It's a brave man who takes command
of his own destiny.

933
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,178
Well, thanks.
I feel pretty good about it myself.

934
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,785
And you don't feel guilty running around
with Ellen behind Cindy Jo's back?

935
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:25,828
Guilty? Why should I feel guilty?
I just got here, remember?

936
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:29,061
It's- It's not like I have a history
with Cindy Jo or anything.

937
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:33,507
Well, okay. Fine.

938
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,229
Wait a second.

939
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:42,028
- What do you mean, ',',Well, okay. Fine"?
- Nothing, really. I-It's just that...

940
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:45,386
Cindy Jo has been a loyal
and loving wife for the last ten years.

941
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:50,222
- What are you getting at?
- Your destiny has been changed, Larry-

942
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:52,983
by request, I might add-
and you must take responsibility...

943
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,459
for the circumstances
of your new life.

944
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:59,782
They are, after all,
of your own making.

945
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:03,624
Well, if I made 'em,
I can unmake 'em.

946
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,828
- Good evening, mr Burrows.
- Hi.

947
01:08:18,710 --> 01:08:23,022
- Any trouble finding the place?
- No. No trouble at all.

948
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,783
That's good. That's good.

949
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:28,987
These are for you.

950
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:31,584
They're lovely.

951
01:08:31,670 --> 01:08:33,945
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

952
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:37,306
I'm afraid, uh, Hercules
got dog drool all over 'em- uh-

953
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:39,984
How'd you know
his name was Hercules?

954
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,061
Because it's on his tag...

955
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:45,938
that I've been staring at
for the past five minutes.

956
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:50,023
Okay. Come here, boy.
Come here. Hercules. Hercules.

957
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,021
Ow.

958
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:01,788
Nice doggie. Good doggie.

959
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:07,865
- I don't think he likes me.
- Well, he's an exceptional judge of character.

960
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,582
We aren't starting off
very well, are we?

961
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:17,300
There is only so far that I will go for
my union brothers and sisters, mr Burrows.

962
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:22,623
- Oh, please. Call me Lar.
- We agreed to keep this evening strictly on a business level, correct?

963
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:27,830
Absolutely. God.
I forgot how beautiful you are.

964
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,062
mr Burrows, if this is your attempt
to soften me up...

965
01:09:32,150 --> 01:09:34,300
so that you can win concessions
from the union, I-

966
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:36,426
I don't want concessions. Honest.

967
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,502
The contracts are as good
as signed.

968
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,263
You could have done that
at the meeting.

969
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:45,581
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

970
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:48,184
Really. I just thought maybe
we'd get to know each other again-

971
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:50,784
uh, better.

972
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,024
- Wait, wait. Just wait. Wait-Wait a
minute. Wait a minute. - Oh, yes, sir.

973
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:09,500
No, no, no. I'll get it.
Oh. Wait, wait. I'll get the door.

974
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:11,501
my dear.

975
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,988
- Hello?
- Let me talk to mrs Burrows.

976
01:10:29,070 --> 01:10:30,981
This is mrs Burrows.

977
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:33,300
This way, monsieur.

978
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:40,178
Enjoy your meal, monsieur, madame.

979
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,500
Thank you.
This place is all right, huh?

980
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:45,787
- You sound like you've never been here before.
- Oh, I haven't.

981
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:49,749
my secretary made the reservations. I'm
strictly a pizza-and-burger man myself.

982
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,143
Pizza-and-burger man, huh?

983
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,740
The chef has prepared something
very special for you this evening.

984
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:01,741
Great.

985
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:12,500
Bring two of'em.
It's food, right? Good.

986
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:15,701
Ah, I ordered for the both of us.
Hope you don't mind.

987
01:11:18,910 --> 01:11:21,504
- may I bring for you some wine?
- Yes. Wine. Would you like some wine?

988
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:25,469
- I understand the French make it pretty
good. - No, thank you. I think I'll just have-

989
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:28,348
Virgin mary. Tabasco sauce
and lime, no ground pepper. Right?

990
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:35,140
I'm impressed. You must have had
your spies working overtime.

991
01:11:35,230 --> 01:11:38,142
Uh, I'll have a light beer,
no glass.

992
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:41,427
Spies? I don't have any spies.

993
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,468
I just happen to
know a lot about you.

994
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:48,189
Well, I know a few things
about you.

995
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,659
Yeah? Like what?

996
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:53,389
Nothing I could repeat.

997
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:56,746
- Well, that bad, huh?
- The only thing that doesn't fit...

998
01:11:56,830 --> 01:11:58,900
is what you did
for Clip this afternoon.

999
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:01,663
Oh, that. Well, you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

1000
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,583
Try me.

1001
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:10,068
How well do you remember 1970?

1002
01:12:19,990 --> 01:12:22,185
Bastard.

1003
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:35,383
You bastard!

1004
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:45,145
That's why I did what I did for Clip,
and that's how come...

1005
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,664
I know so much about you.

1006
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:51,379
Because we were married?

1007
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:53,904
Exactly!

1008
01:12:53,990 --> 01:12:56,982
Do you have any idea
how ridiculous that sounds?

1009
01:12:57,070 --> 01:13:01,985
Well, I didn't think
you'd believe me.

1010
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:06,541
Ah. I probably shouldn't have told you.
Forget I said anything.

1011
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,106
Ah! Dinner.

1012
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:15,138
Boy, it looks pretty good.

1013
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:18,501
Do we know what this is?

1014
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,947
<i>Calf brains. Bon appetit.</i>

1015
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:27,103
<i>Wow, I feel good</i>

1016
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,499
<i>- I knew that I would, now
- We'd like a, uh, large pizza...</i>

1017
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:33,219
<i>- double cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms and, uh, anchovies.
- I feel good</i>

1018
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:37,098
<i>- Uh, but only on half, because, uh, anchovies give her heartburn.
- I knew that I would, now</i>

1019
01:13:37,190 --> 01:13:40,148
<i>- So good, so good
- Right? - Right.</i>

1020
01:13:40,230 --> 01:13:42,425
<i>- You got it? - I got you - Yes,
sir. That'll be about 20 minutes.</i>

1021
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,978
<i>- Twenty minutes. This way, my dear.
- I feel good</i>

1022
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:47,823
- And a couple of sodas.
- Got it.

1023
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,538
Come on. Tell the truth. How do you
really know so much about me?

1024
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:58,384
- You spy on your employees, don't you?
- No, I don't.

1025
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:01,746
- I already told you.
- Right, right. We were married.

1026
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,902
Exactly! Thank you.

1027
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:08,825
- You're not gonna give it up, are you?
- No way.

1028
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,378
If we weren't married,
how could I know that you sleep...

1029
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,462
in an old, faded flannel shirt
your dad gave you, hmm?

1030
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:17,462
Spies.

1031
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:22,908
How come I know that every night you brush your hair exactly 86 times
- 43 forward, 43 back?

1032
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:25,185
Spies.

1033
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:27,420
Yeah.

1034
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:30,582
I know that your favourite part
of the body is the earlobe.

1035
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:34,185
I know that your favourite actor is William
Bendix because he looks just like your Uncle Bud...

1036
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:38,821
whose wife, Aunt Esther, used to send you two
dozen white handkerchiefs every Christmas...

1037
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:43,381
with ',',EJR" embroidered
right in the corner.

1038
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:47,145
Now, that's not the kind of stuff
you get from spies, is it?

1039
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,626
There's got to be
some logical explanation for this.

1040
01:14:51,710 --> 01:14:53,621
You couldn't possibly
know those things.

1041
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:58,579
I know everything.
Go ahead. Ask me.

1042
01:14:58,670 --> 01:15:01,059
Ask me something
I couldn't possibly know.

1043
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,586
But if I get it right, will you believe
that we were married in another life?

1044
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,706
- maybe.
- All right.

1045
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,899
Give me your best shot.

1046
01:15:14,990 --> 01:15:17,060
All right.

1047
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:22,105
- The day I got my driver's licence-
- October 23, 1970. Right?

1048
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,620
my dad let me take the car out
on my own.

1049
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:29,942
Oldsmobile, vinyl top,
two-tone- Okay.

1050
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:34,069
Two blocks from my house,
I got pulled over for speeding.

1051
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,106
I never told anyone.

1052
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:40,624
I even paid for the ticket
out of my own allowance.

1053
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,668
- You want to know the name of the cop?
- No.

1054
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:46,867
I want to know the name of the song
on the radio.

1055
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,340
That's it? That's your best shot?

1056
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:53,661
Huh. Let's see here.

1057
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,218
It's not ',',mack the Knife. " No.

1058
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:58,983
It's not ',',Happy Birthday. "

1059
01:15:59,070 --> 01:16:02,267
It's not mtley Cre.
They weren't born yet. Um-

1060
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:08,459
Is it this one?

1061
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,821
Oh, God.

1062
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,822
<i>Hey</i>

1063
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:40,539
<i>Well, my temperature's rising
Got my feet on the floor</i>

1064
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,463
<i>Crazy people knocking
'cause they want to go more</i>

1065
01:16:43,550 --> 01:16:46,223
<i>Let me in, baby
I don't know what you got</i>

1066
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:49,188
<i>But you'd better take it easy
'cause this place is hot</i>

1067
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,148
<i>And I'm so glad you made it</i>

1068
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:58,065
<i>So glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin'</i>

1069
01:16:58,150 --> 01:17:04,346
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Gimme some lovin'</i>

1070
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:06,660
<i>Every day</i>

1071
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,302
<i>Hey</i>

1072
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:28,507
<i>Well, I feel so good
Everybody's getting high</i>

1073
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:31,866
<i>You'd better take it easy
'cause the place is on fire</i>

1074
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:34,942
<i>Been a hard day
and I don't know what to do</i>

1075
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:37,590
<i>We made it, baby
and it had to be you</i>

1076
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,629
<i>And I'm so glad you made it</i>

1077
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:45,988
<i>So glad you made it
You got to gimme some lovin'</i>

1078
01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:52,508
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Gimme some lovin'</i>

1079
01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:56,424
<i>- Gimme, gimme some lovin'
- Whoo-hoo, hey, hey, hey</i>

1080
01:17:56,510 --> 01:18:01,789
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'
Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

1081
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:07,066
<i>Gimme, gimme some lovin'</i>

1082
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,860
So, you going to invite me in
for a nightcap...

1083
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:15,579
you know, to celebrate the end
of our negotiations?

1084
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:18,389
No. I don't think
that's such a good idea.

1085
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:21,507
maybe after
the contracts are signed.

1086
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:24,787
Okay. I understand.

1087
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:28,385
We're just gonna have to get those
contracts signed really quickly then, huh?

1088
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,382
You got a pen? I could do it now.

1089
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,099
- Good night, mr Burrows.
- Larry. Larry. Please.

1090
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,660
I had a fun evening, Larry.
Thanks.

1091
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,538
I did too. Brought back
a lot of good memories.

1092
01:18:49,950 --> 01:18:54,182
Well, good night.

1093
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,386
- Larry?
- Yes?

1094
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:05,621
If we had such
a great life together...

1095
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:08,622
why'd you want it changed?

1096
01:19:10,390 --> 01:19:12,381
I guess...

1097
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:16,625
I just didn't know what I had.

1098
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,152
Oh, honey, you didn't have
to wait up for me.

1099
01:19:41,234 --> 01:19:44,146
- Larry, who is she?
- Who's who?

1100
01:19:44,234 --> 01:19:47,431
The bimbo you had dinner with
at La Scala.

1101
01:19:48,954 --> 01:19:51,184
Oh, her?

1102
01:19:51,274 --> 01:19:55,313
She's a, uh-

1103
01:19:55,394 --> 01:19:58,830
detective from
the police force-

1104
01:19:58,914 --> 01:20:01,667
Larry, stop lying.

1105
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:08,388
All right. No more lies.

1106
01:20:14,474 --> 01:20:17,910
How well do you remember 1970?

1107
01:20:17,994 --> 01:20:20,952
Cindy? Cindy?

1108
01:20:22,034 --> 01:20:26,471
Cindy Jo? Come on, honey.
I swear to God it's the truth. Honest.

1109
01:20:26,554 --> 01:20:30,467
Come on. Let me up, Cindy.
I'm standing out here without any clo-

1110
01:20:31,554 --> 01:20:34,944
Thank you, dear. Thank you.
Could I have my sh-shoe-

1111
01:20:35,034 --> 01:20:37,264
You're so kind, honey.
I really appreciate it...

1112
01:20:37,354 --> 01:20:40,107
but do you think I can
come upstairs and change?

1113
01:20:40,194 --> 01:20:42,867
I can change in the garage, honey.
Thank you.

1114
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,752
Oops. I did it again.
You'd think I'd get it right just once.

1115
01:21:00,034 --> 01:21:02,594
Oh, well. Hello?

1116
01:21:02,674 --> 01:21:05,108
Daddy?

1117
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:07,469
Larry's fallen in love
with someone else.

1118
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:11,270
Oh, my!

1119
01:21:11,354 --> 01:21:15,472
Oh, yes, dear.
I know I own the company, but-

1120
01:21:15,554 --> 01:21:18,864
All right. I will. Yes, dear.

1121
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:21,752
Now, you take a Valium
and go to bed.

1122
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:24,223
Okay. Goodbye.

1123
01:21:26,594 --> 01:21:31,145
Fire LJ Burrows?
How do I fire LJ Burrows?

1124
01:21:32,914 --> 01:21:35,030
LJ, you're fired.

1125
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:39,271
LJ, you are fired!

1126
01:21:40,554 --> 01:21:43,193
LJ, you rotten son of a bitch...

1127
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:45,708
you can't do that
to my baby girl and get away with it.

1128
01:21:45,794 --> 01:21:48,228
You're fired!

1129
01:21:48,314 --> 01:21:50,782
That's not bad.

1130
01:21:50,874 --> 01:21:54,184
maybe I'll just write him a letter
and leave it in his office.

1131
01:21:54,274 --> 01:21:56,344
Yeah. That'd be better.

1132
01:21:59,074 --> 01:22:01,383
Dear LJ...

1133
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:07,070
you rotten son of a bitch.

1134
01:22:09,954 --> 01:22:12,866
It's very simple, really.
The police will think...

1135
01:22:12,954 --> 01:22:16,424
he happened into the wrong place
at the wrong time and became...

1136
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:21,668
the poor, innocent victim
of murderous thieves.

1137
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:23,710
The little prick!

1138
01:22:23,794 --> 01:22:26,069
With him out of the way...

1139
01:22:28,394 --> 01:22:31,943
the Nakamura deal
can proceed as planned.

1140
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:34,753
Yeah, but what
if he doesn't show up?

1141
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:38,543
Stop being such a geek.
Of course he'll show.

1142
01:22:38,634 --> 01:22:41,387
After his wife throws him out...

1143
01:22:42,794 --> 01:22:45,786
where else would he go?

1144
01:22:49,634 --> 01:22:53,991
Uh, where do you think
you're goin', big fella?

1145
01:22:54,074 --> 01:22:58,386
Sorry, Niles. I-
I can't go through with it.

1146
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,783
Fine. Don't need your help.

1147
01:23:01,874 --> 01:23:03,830
Nobody...

1148
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:06,667
double-crosses Niles Pender...

1149
01:23:06,754 --> 01:23:11,589
out of 120 million bucks!

1150
01:23:24,314 --> 01:23:28,102
Oh. Oh, that old thing.

1151
01:23:28,194 --> 01:23:31,231
I'm not afraid of him.

1152
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:35,549
Well, let's see.

1153
01:23:36,634 --> 01:23:39,467
Hope there's nobody in here.

1154
01:23:44,194 --> 01:23:46,947
Shit!

1155
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:05,747
Is God smiling on me or what?

1156
01:24:43,994 --> 01:24:45,985
Oh, God. mr Hansen?

1157
01:24:46,074 --> 01:24:48,269
mr Hansen?

1158
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:59,713
- mr Hansen.
- Cover him. He's got a weapon.

1159
01:25:03,434 --> 01:25:06,506
- All right. Let's go.
- Here we go.

1160
01:25:07,634 --> 01:25:10,512
I'm telling you, I didn't know
Leo was gonna fire me.

1161
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:14,553
I didn't see any letter. And even
if I had, I wouldn't have killed him.

1162
01:25:14,634 --> 01:25:17,944
Look, Niles Pender is the one you should
be arresting, not me. I'm innocent.

1163
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:21,709
Niles Pender set this whole thing up.
He's trying to take over the company.

1164
01:25:21,794 --> 01:25:24,024
I mean, he killed Leo.
Leo's a friend of mine.

1165
01:25:24,114 --> 01:25:27,789
I was just golfing with him. I wouldn't
hurt him. I'm too nice of a guy.

1166
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:32,186
Pender was the one. Look-

1167
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,629
I need a lawyer.
I don't wanna get in the car.

1168
01:25:39,634 --> 01:25:44,389
- Jewel!
- Think you can just write me off like a bad debt, huh?

1169
01:25:45,674 --> 01:25:48,347
Well, it's time to pay up, mister.

1170
01:25:50,114 --> 01:25:53,390
Ouch, ouch, oh, ouch, oh, oh!

1171
01:25:53,474 --> 01:25:56,511
- What are we gonna do?
- Help! help!

1172
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:28,544
Ellen!

1173
01:26:28,632 --> 01:26:31,430
Ellen.

1174
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,708
Larry, what is it?

1175
01:26:36,792 --> 01:26:38,862
I gotta go,
and you gotta come with me.

1176
01:26:38,952 --> 01:26:41,182
Whoa, Larry. Slow down.

1177
01:26:41,272 --> 01:26:43,911
- Tell me what's going on.
- Nothing's goin' on.

1178
01:26:43,992 --> 01:26:48,031
Nothin'. I just wanna be with you
like we were before.

1179
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:50,785
I- I-I know you don't think
it's gonna work, but it will.

1180
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,181
You know why?
Because we've already done it.

1181
01:26:53,272 --> 01:26:56,230
Are you talking about
the ',',previous life" thing again, Larry?

1182
01:26:56,312 --> 01:27:01,181
Yes. Yes. We'll have Thanksgiving
and-and Christmas and-and birthdays...

1183
01:27:01,272 --> 01:27:04,821
and- and breakfast together,
just like it was.

1184
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:08,825
- I don't mean to rush you, but we gotta go.
- Wait a minute, Larry.

1185
01:27:08,912 --> 01:27:11,984
That all sounds wonderful.
It really does. It's just that...

1186
01:27:12,072 --> 01:27:14,825
after our dinner,
I started thinking about things...

1187
01:27:14,912 --> 01:27:17,665
about what has
real importance to me.

1188
01:27:17,752 --> 01:27:19,663
You know, I been thinkin' about what's
important to me too.

1189
01:27:19,752 --> 01:27:23,028
And you know what it is?
It's us being together-

1190
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:25,865
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Hello.

1191
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:29,467
Uh, Tom, this is my boss,
Larry Burrows.

1192
01:27:29,552 --> 01:27:32,669
Larry, this is my husband, Tom.

1193
01:27:34,312 --> 01:27:37,384
- Hi, Tom.
- Nice to meet you, mr Burrows.

1194
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:40,032
Nice to meet you.

1195
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:45,061
- So what's going on, Ellen?
- Oh, nothing's going on, uh, Tom.

1196
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:50,180
Uh, I'm going out of town, and so I
thought I'd stop by and say ',',so long. "

1197
01:27:52,992 --> 01:27:56,746
Well, so long.

1198
01:28:08,272 --> 01:28:11,389
Uh, I-I've got to
tell him one thing.

1199
01:28:11,472 --> 01:28:13,702
Larry?

1200
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:24,507
I was wrong about you.

1201
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:27,782
I think you're
a wonderful man.

1202
01:28:27,872 --> 01:28:31,262
I wish it could have been
different between us.

1203
01:28:31,352 --> 01:28:34,901
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.

1204
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:37,142
Sorry.

1205
01:29:02,432 --> 01:29:07,142
Wait a minute. That's bullshit.
It was meant to be!

1206
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:56,382
Jesus!

1207
01:29:56,472 --> 01:29:58,861
Shit!

1208
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:07,227
Oh.

1209
01:30:27,592 --> 01:30:29,503
Oh, no.

1210
01:30:36,592 --> 01:30:39,026
Oh, no. Not Sammy.

1211
01:30:40,112 --> 01:30:43,707
I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

1212
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:45,942
I'm sorry.

1213
01:30:54,672 --> 01:30:56,583
I'm sorry.

1214
01:31:32,312 --> 01:31:34,542
I give up.

1215
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,704
Oh, my God! mike!

1216
01:31:51,912 --> 01:31:54,984
mike? mike, where are you?

1217
01:31:55,072 --> 01:31:57,540
mike, I need you.

1218
01:32:16,952 --> 01:32:19,546
Oh. Disgusting.

1219
01:32:29,872 --> 01:32:31,908
Oh.

1220
01:32:37,232 --> 01:32:40,304
Okay. I'm coming.

1221
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:44,902
Don't shoot. I'm not armed.

1222
01:32:49,112 --> 01:32:51,467
Somebody here
call for a tow truck?

1223
01:32:51,552 --> 01:32:54,305
Tow truck?

1224
01:32:57,672 --> 01:33:01,301
- You all right, Larry?
- I'm back.

1225
01:33:01,392 --> 01:33:03,701
Son of a bitch, I'm back!

1226
01:33:03,792 --> 01:33:07,262
Back from where, Larry?
You've been here the whole time.

1227
01:33:11,632 --> 01:33:17,264
- I'm really back, aren't I?
- You've always been here, Larry.

1228
01:33:17,352 --> 01:33:20,901
Sure I have,
you old destiny-bender, you.

1229
01:33:23,912 --> 01:33:26,221
I love this guy.
He's great, isn't he?

1230
01:33:26,312 --> 01:33:28,462
I just love this guy!

1231
01:33:33,152 --> 01:33:35,427
Thanks.

1232
01:33:35,512 --> 01:33:39,744
Thanks for everything-
the good and the bad.

1233
01:33:43,872 --> 01:33:47,103
Boy, you sure do know
how to make a point.

1234
01:33:50,952 --> 01:33:55,503
Oh, and listen, mike. Whatever you got
planned for the rest of my life...

1235
01:33:56,592 --> 01:33:59,311
it's perfect.

1236
01:33:59,392 --> 01:34:02,065
Happy birthday, Larry.

1237
01:34:02,152 --> 01:34:04,108
Thanks, mike.

1238
01:34:10,072 --> 01:34:13,144
Hey, I haven't seen you before,
have I? You the new guy?

1239
01:34:13,232 --> 01:34:15,700
What's your name? ',',Duncan. "

1240
01:34:15,792 --> 01:34:20,468
Well, Duncan, you're gonna become real
familiar with me and this piece of sh-

1241
01:34:21,752 --> 01:34:24,664
Nakamura's gonna sign the deal at 8:00.
It gives me ten minutes.

1242
01:34:24,752 --> 01:34:26,663
- Come on. Let's go. Give me a ride!
- Yeah, but I gotta hook up the car.

1243
01:34:26,752 --> 01:34:31,143
Forget about the car. We'll come back
for it later. Come on, Duncan, will ya?

1244
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:44,781
And therefore, gentlemen, it is
the recommendation of this board...

1245
01:34:44,872 --> 01:34:50,390
that we accept mr Nakamura's very
generous, very creative buyout offer...

1246
01:34:50,472 --> 01:34:52,622
of $35 a share.

1247
01:34:52,712 --> 01:34:54,987
Now, if you'll
just sign here, mr Hansen.

1248
01:35:02,032 --> 01:35:04,592
You really think
this is a good idea, Niles?

1249
01:35:04,672 --> 01:35:07,630
Without question, sir.

1250
01:35:17,872 --> 01:35:20,989
Burrows, what do you think
you're doing?

1251
01:35:23,672 --> 01:35:26,948
Sorry,Jackie.
Sorry, mr Hansen.

1252
01:35:27,032 --> 01:35:30,661
I'm just tired of assholes getting ahead
while decent people get the shaft.

1253
01:35:30,752 --> 01:35:33,266
What's this all about, Larry?

1254
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:35,547
Niles and Lewis here have been
buying up company stock...

1255
01:35:35,632 --> 01:35:38,385
through a dummy corporation
while encouraging the board...

1256
01:35:38,472 --> 01:35:43,277
to sell out to mr Nakamura.

1257
01:35:43,312 --> 01:35:46,190
Right here. The one
with all the mud in the driveway.

1258
01:35:47,312 --> 01:35:49,507
- Hey, listen. Thanks for the lift.
- Oh, hey, it's no problem.

1259
01:35:49,592 --> 01:35:53,221
- No. I appreciate it.
- I'm gonna go back and get your car. What do you want me to do with it?

1260
01:35:53,312 --> 01:35:58,432
Uh, keep it. It's yours.
I'm gonna buy a brand new one.

1261
01:35:58,512 --> 01:36:01,231
I'll figure out
how to pay for it later.

1262
01:36:01,312 --> 01:36:03,507
Take care.

1263
01:36:09,592 --> 01:36:13,187
Oh, damn. I forgot.
Ellen's at the strike meeting.

1264
01:36:22,392 --> 01:36:25,111
Surprise!

1265
01:36:26,272 --> 01:36:29,582
Ellen!

1266
01:36:29,672 --> 01:36:32,630
- Happy 35th, Larry!
- Look at all you.

1267
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:35,351
Oh. Oh, mom.

1268
01:36:35,432 --> 01:36:40,460
Aw, Clip! Dad! Oh, God.
I've missed all you guys so much.

1269
01:36:40,552 --> 01:36:43,749
- You have?
- Oh, Ellen.

1270
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:47,461
I'd forgotten
how beautiful you are.

1271
01:36:51,992 --> 01:36:54,631
Oh, wait-wait till
I tell you guys what happened.

1272
01:36:54,712 --> 01:36:57,021
- You're not gonna believe what happened.
- Oh, honey. Clip told us.

1273
01:36:57,112 --> 01:36:59,023
It's okay. We'll manage.
I'll work overtime-

1274
01:36:59,112 --> 01:37:02,309
Oh, no. Not that.
I can get a new job anywhere.

1275
01:37:02,392 --> 01:37:07,022
I just- I'm just so glad
to see everyone.

1276
01:37:07,112 --> 01:37:09,785
Sammy! Where's Sammy? Sammy!

1277
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:13,990
Sammy! Come here! Oh, Sammy!

1278
01:37:14,072 --> 01:37:18,384
I love you too, baby. Aww.

1279
01:37:18,472 --> 01:37:20,827
We'll go driving
all weekend, okay?

1280
01:37:20,912 --> 01:37:23,665
All right, honey.

1281
01:37:23,752 --> 01:37:27,984
- So were you really surprised?
- Oh, this whole day has been a surprise, honey.

1282
01:37:28,072 --> 01:37:32,304
- Are you hungry?
- No, but, you know, I'd like a cup of coffee.

1283
01:37:32,392 --> 01:37:35,270
Oh, honey, I forgot to buy any.
Sorry. I'll get some more tomorrow.

1284
01:37:35,352 --> 01:37:37,263
I promise.

1285
01:37:38,352 --> 01:37:41,981
Clip! Oh, God, did I miss you!

1286
01:37:42,072 --> 01:37:46,031
- You look so- so-
- Hot?

1287
01:37:46,112 --> 01:37:48,148
Thank you.

1288
01:37:48,232 --> 01:37:51,668
- Happy 35th, buddy.
- Clip.

1289
01:37:51,752 --> 01:37:55,950
This is your real present. I gave you
the vomit to throw you off suspicion.

1290
01:37:56,032 --> 01:37:59,786
- It worked, didn't it?
- Yeah. Like a charm.

1291
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:02,511
It's a Gullwing mercedes.
Do you like it?

1292
01:38:02,592 --> 01:38:05,743
Ah, Clip, I love it.

1293
01:38:06,872 --> 01:38:09,466
I've always wanted one of these.

1294
01:38:09,552 --> 01:38:12,828
- Thanks.
- Hey, hey.

1295
01:38:12,912 --> 01:38:15,426
Check out my date.

1296
01:38:15,512 --> 01:38:17,980
Is she a killer or what?

1297
01:38:19,392 --> 01:38:21,508
Definitely a killer.

1298
01:38:21,592 --> 01:38:24,231
Yeah.

1299
01:38:27,112 --> 01:38:30,343
Hi.

1300
01:38:30,432 --> 01:38:32,707
I'll have a light beer, Clip.

1301
01:38:32,792 --> 01:38:36,228
- Jackie, Cindy Jo!
- Hey, we don't wanna interrupt.

1302
01:38:36,312 --> 01:38:40,385
- No. Come on in, please. Please.
- Okay. This'll just take a minute.

1303
01:38:40,472 --> 01:38:44,147
- What's up?
- Look. After you left, Niles and Lewis confessed to everything.

1304
01:38:44,232 --> 01:38:46,382
- That was a real touchdown, Larry.
- Well-

1305
01:38:46,472 --> 01:38:49,270
You know? Listen.
We just dropped by to say thanks.

1306
01:38:49,352 --> 01:38:51,468
I mean,
you ran out of there so fast-

1307
01:38:51,552 --> 01:38:54,271
Well, I had to get home.
I- It's my birthday.

1308
01:38:54,352 --> 01:38:56,308
Well, then,
I got a little present for you.

1309
01:38:56,392 --> 01:38:59,862
The board voted unanimously
to offer you Niles Pender's job-

1310
01:38:59,952 --> 01:39:02,671
executive vice president.

1311
01:39:02,752 --> 01:39:04,822
Wow.

1312
01:39:04,912 --> 01:39:08,348
Well- Well,Jackie,
I- I-I don't know.

1313
01:39:08,432 --> 01:39:12,425
So much has happened today. I-
I'm gonna have to give it some thought.

1314
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:15,709
- 125,000 to start and a mercedes.
- Thought's over.

1315
01:39:15,792 --> 01:39:18,465
- Wonderful!
- Oh, that's just great. Thank you,Jackie.

1316
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,624
- Hey, you hungry? You thirsty?
- Hey. Time out.

1317
01:39:21,712 --> 01:39:25,307
- Yeah.
- Hi, Larry.

1318
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:28,225
Hi, Cindy Jo.

1319
01:39:28,312 --> 01:39:30,906
I wish I'd known it was your birthday.
I would've gotten you something.

1320
01:39:32,352 --> 01:39:36,027
Well, Cindy Jo,
you've-you've already given me more...

1321
01:39:36,112 --> 01:39:39,502
than you could
possibly know, really.

1322
01:39:39,592 --> 01:39:41,901
Well, happy birthday, Larry.

1323
01:39:41,992 --> 01:39:43,903
Thanks.

1324
01:39:52,272 --> 01:39:54,388
Well, that's it.

1325
01:39:54,472 --> 01:39:56,667
That was my 35th birthday.

1326
01:39:56,752 --> 01:39:58,663
I told you it was weird.

1327
01:39:58,752 --> 01:40:01,505
It's so weird, I probably
shouldn't tell anybody about it.

1328
01:40:01,592 --> 01:40:03,981
I mean, who'd believe me?

1329
01:40:04,072 --> 01:40:06,711
I'm not even sure
I believe it myself.

1330
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:16,065
Way to go, Burrows!

1331
01:40:30,230 --> 01:40:34,303
Saw the game, kid.

1332
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:37,780
- Tough break.
- You said it, mister.

1333
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:42,789
- I blew it good.
- Don't worry too much about it.

1334
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:47,068
Remember, you've got your whole life
to look forward to.

1335
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:50,460
Things will work out just fine.

1336
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,548
Trust me.

1337
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:04,262
Old fart.
What the hell does he know?

1338
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:12,544
<i>Only you</i>

1339
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:17,988
<i>Can make a-this world seem right</i>

1340
01:41:19,270 --> 01:41:24,185

1344
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:47,462
<i>And fill my heart with love</i>

1345
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:53,068
<i>For only you</i>

1346
01:41:53,150 --> 01:41:58,702
<i>Only you</i>

1347
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:03,625
<i>Can make a-this change in me</i>

1348
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:09,825
<i>For it's true</i>

1349
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:16,258
<i>You are my destiny</i>

1350
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:23,028
<i>When you hold my hand
I understand</i>

1351
01:42:23,110 --> 01:42:27,501

1
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:19,896
<i>Evil alliance.</i>

2
00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:22,462
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress</i>

3
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,290
<i>escape Obi-Wan Kenobi's assault
once again.</i>

4
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:29,480
<i>With their plan to build
a crime organization in peril,</i>

5
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:32,468
<i>the brothers' fate
is about to be changed forever</i>

6
00:00:32,536 --> 00:00:37,303
<i>as they drift, barely alive,
through unknown space.</i>

7
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,249
What are you?

8
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:22,861
Should we rub 'em out?

9
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,453
No, I want to hear their story.

10
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:29,811
If they're an enemy of the Jedi,
then they're a friend of mine.

11
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:31,522
Load 'em up.

12
00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:00,388
Savage...

13
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,655
You're not Jedi.

14
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:11,763
So what are you?

15
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:19,953
We are Sith.

16
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:22,806
Do you serve Count Dooku?

17
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:25,760
I serve no one.

18
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:28,546
I thought there could only be two Sith;

19
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:30,862
a master and an apprentice.

20
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:33,649
We are brothers.

21
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:37,241
The true Lords of the Sith.

22
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:38,752
What happened to your ship?

23
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,773
Destroyed by Jedi.

24
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,351
Do you know which Jedi?

25
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:45,567
Kenobi.

26
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:51,643
And what do you seek now, Sith?

27
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:55,673
Fortune and power.

28
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,620
Repair this one's legs,

29
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,836
and do what you can for the other.

30
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:01,582
Yes, sir.

31
00:04:08,802 --> 00:04:10,815
Go on.
Get moving.

32
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,813
In time for tea.

33
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,324
Come join me.

34
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,488
Made with the florets of a Cassius tree.

35
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:32,166
It's good for your health.

36
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,558
Your mark?

37
00:04:40,627 --> 00:04:42,942
The sign of Clan Vizsla.

38
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:44,821
I am Pre Vizsla.

39
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,567
We are the Death Watch,

40
00:04:46,635 --> 00:04:48,446
descendants of the true warrior faith

41
00:04:48,515 --> 00:04:50,931
all Mandalorians once knew.

42
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,541
Now my people are living in exile

43
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,597
because we will not abandon
our heritage.

44
00:04:55,665 --> 00:05:00,364
Our people were warriors;
strong, feared.

45
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,479
Now they're ruled
by the new Mandalorians

46
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:05,904
who think that being a pacifist
is a good thing.

47
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,589
They've given away our honor
and tradition

48
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,040
for peace.

49
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:13,089
Duchess Satine
and her corrupt leadership

50
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:17,084
are crushing our souls,
destroying our identity.

51
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,736
That is our struggle.

52
00:05:19,805 --> 00:05:23,328
If they are weak, why do you wait?

53
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,611
The duchess has powerful allies,

54
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,297
including your Jedi friend, Kenobi.

55
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:34,206
He is also responsible for our exile.

56
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:37,564
Perhaps fortune brought us together.

57
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:40,584
It is the will of the Force.

58
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:44,244
We can help you reclaim Mandalore.

59
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:48,170
And punish Kenobi for his trespasses.

60
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:50,755
We allied ourselves with Sith before.

61
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,373
Count Dooku, he betrayed us.

62
00:05:53,442 --> 00:05:55,018
Sith are no better than Jedi.

63
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,973
They claim to be powerful,
but we put these two

64
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:00,524
back together
after the Jedi gutted them.

65
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,189
Doubt will only lead to failure.

66
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:07,942
Hold!

67
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,467
Our combined strength will be rewarded.

68
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,448
Mandalore will be yours,

69
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:17,006
and Kenobi, this Sith pretender Dooku,

70
00:06:17,075 --> 00:06:21,438
and all our enemies will fall.

71
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,205
Check on your brother.

72
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:27,783
We'll put it to a vote.

73
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:52,423
Rest, apprentice.

74
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,833
You're safe.

75
00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:01,051
Our crash was discovered
by enemies of the Jedi,

76
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,937
and we are in their care.

77
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,294
Are we prisoners?

78
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:09,644
No.

79
00:07:09,713 --> 00:07:11,390
Allies.

80
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,176
They have much to offer,
including their planet.

81
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:17,265
They are strong, and unlike pirates,

82
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:19,379
they possess honor.

83
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,697
Another weakness.

84
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,517
They know nothing of our intentions.

85
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:28,613
Those revelations will come too late.

86
00:07:34,725 --> 00:07:36,435
I see you have your strength back.

87
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:37,510
Ugh.

88
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,481
I never got your names.

89
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,864
I am Maul.

90
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:51,845
This is Savage.

91
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:53,993
Our brothers are in favor of an alliance

92
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:55,538
to liberate Mandalore.

93
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,894
This duchess of yours will soon discover

94
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:02,118
the true burden of peace.

95
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:16,388
Your people are strong and skilled,

96
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:20,081
but you will need an army
to free Mandalore.

97
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,271
There are more on Mandalore
who'll join us.

98
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,452
Their help would come too late.

99
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:29,413
We can assemble an army,
beginning with the Black Sun.

100
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:31,461
They're a crime syndicate.

101
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,409
Hardly a force to rally with.

102
00:08:33,476 --> 00:08:35,992
They can provide us
with the resources we need

103
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:40,929
to sustain a war without
the scrutiny of the Republic.

104
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,367
A battalion, brother.

105
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:37,389
They will serve us well.

106
00:09:40,545 --> 00:09:43,732
We request an audience
with your leaders.

107
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,117
It'll be your funeral.

108
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:09,180
Why do you come here?

109
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,697
We seek an army.

110
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,141
Fools.

111
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:15,222
We are not mercenaries.

112
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,102
Dispose of them.

113
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,594
Keep their ships and weapons.

114
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,676
Give me that one's sword.

115
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,591
This is your last opportunity
to join us.

116
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:40,572
Quiet.

117
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,720
We are the Black Sun!

118
00:10:48,327 --> 00:10:50,106
Hmm.

119
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,919
Very well, then.

120
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:05,986
It would seem the decision
to join us is now yours.

121
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:08,806
After careful consideration,

122
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:10,652
we will join you.

123
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,003
Show us your supplies.

124
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:30,091
We have our army now.

125
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,348
I have a plan to undermine Satine.

126
00:11:33,415 --> 00:11:35,798
The army is weak.

127
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:38,785
We are not ready for the duchess.

128
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:41,941
With my plan,
we won't need a bigger force.

129
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:45,030
There is only one plan.

130
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,271
One vision.

131
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,360
And it belongs to Death Watch.

132
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:51,879
Your vision lacks clarity.

133
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:54,531
Without us, you have no army

134
00:11:54,599 --> 00:11:58,157
and no reason to replace the duchess.

135
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,286
The depth of this opportunity
eludes you.

136
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,375
You shall watch and learn.

137
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,315
More criminals.

138
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,933
Spice dealers connected
to all the crime families

139
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,510
of Coruscant.

140
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:44,786
The Pykes.

141
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:47,506
They will be the next to join us.

142
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,004
We know you've been forming an army.

143
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:54,589
Were you expecting us?

144
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:57,375
Underworld's a small community.

145
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,363
I have no desire to oppose you.

146
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:02,512
We come to join you.

147
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:06,137
Very good.

148
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:08,085
Then ready our troops.

149
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:10,368
We leave for Nal Hutta immediately.

150
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:26,584
<i>Da wanga oo Stuka Crispo,
pa ranna hi dopa.</i>

151
00:13:26,651 --> 00:13:29,538
There are many things
the Hutts influence and possess

152
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:31,115
that would be useful to us.

153
00:13:31,184 --> 00:13:33,769
<i>Ah'chu apenkee?</i>

154
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:35,481
We have no credits.

155
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,945
<i>Chut chut,
bargon de moolee-rah?</i>

156
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:41,423
Your lives

157
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:45,350
in exchange for Hutt Space
and everything in its borders.

158
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:49,480
<i>Bunta chupo.</i>

159
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:58,680
<i>Stoopa yatuka.</i>

160
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:19,360
Uh!

161
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:34,936
Ah!

162
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,455
Wah.

163
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,464
Uh!

164
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,963
<i>Killya hooha!</i>

165
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,734
I see negotiations have gone as planned.

166
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:13,346
Secure this platform!

167
00:15:17,408 --> 00:15:18,415
Ugh!

168
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,528
Gah!

169
00:15:31,107 --> 00:15:32,482
Retreat!
Retreat!

170
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,551
Back inside!

171
00:15:57,092 --> 00:15:58,099
Yah!

172
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:06,655
Uh!

173
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:24,990
Whoa!

174
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,285
Ugh!

175
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:02,994
Whoa!

176
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:13,569
Come on, let's get out of here.

177
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,295
Ahh.

178
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:19,477
Let them go.

179
00:17:19,545 --> 00:17:23,270
They're only bounty hunters;
they have no allegiance.

180
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:34,045
Sir, the Hutts have escaped.

181
00:17:34,113 --> 00:17:36,093
Except one.

182
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:41,094
Where are the others?

183
00:17:41,163 --> 00:17:43,210
<i>Hopa!</i>

184
00:17:43,278 --> 00:17:45,459
<i>Hopa!</i>

185
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,716
Kill him.

186
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,348
<i>Hagwa.
Hagwa.</i>

187
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,363
<i>Hagwa.</i>

188
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:57,914
Give me a location.

189
00:17:57,982 --> 00:17:59,191
Tatooine.

190
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,600
Tatooine.

191
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,024
Jabba's palace.

192
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:06,073
So the only thing that you can tell me

193
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:10,505
is that I will find Jabba
at Jabba's palace?

194
00:19:30,475 --> 00:19:34,671
<i>Do dee chabwon geesa bonkee bolla.</i>

195
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:37,524
Give up, Jabba.
You're the only ones left.

196
00:19:38,768 --> 00:19:41,687
Submit or suffer.

197
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:50,718
<i>Weeteebah fa foonta granee, meendeeya.</i>

198
00:19:50,787 --> 00:19:53,236
The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families

199
00:19:53,304 --> 00:19:55,116
have decided to join you.

200
00:20:09,888 --> 00:20:12,305
Between the Hutts, Black Sun,
and the Pykes,

201
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:15,394
we'll have a large reserve
of muscle and supplies.

202
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:17,173
Yes.

203
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:20,329
Then Mandalore and Kenobi
are still our priority?

204
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:22,343
They are vital.

205
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,533
I'm curious to hear the rest
of your plan.

206
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:27,849
The vision has expanded.

207
00:20:27,917 --> 00:20:31,844
You will still rule Mandalore,
and under your protection,

208
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:35,873
I will command
a new galactic underworld.

209
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,132
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

210
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:47,724
It gives you a great deal
of options for your enterprise.

211
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,115
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

212
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,928
With their combined forces,

213
00:20:52,996 --> 00:20:56,688
the Republic and the Separatists
will be irrelevant.

214
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,165
Then are we ready?

215
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,414
Mobilize the army.

216
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,764
Send an advanced guard to the capital.

217
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:06,693
I want a list of targets
vital to Mandalore's security.

218
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,806
Choose wisely.

219
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,661
There will be no second chances.

220
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,049
Stay focused.

221
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,172
Mandalore will soon be ours,
and Maul and his brother

222
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:30,329
will be dead alongside the duchess.

What is it, Commander?

62
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:16,166
In our haste to escape, the navicomputer's
coordinates were inputted incorrectly.

63
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,503
And, well, we're headed right for a star.

64
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,150
It's no use. The navigation computer's
completely fried!

65
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,278
Shut down all power circuits
to reset the coordinates.

66
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,656

I'm just glad
he wasn't awake to see that landing.

81
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,241
He would have been proud.

82
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,827
I've certainly perfected
the art of demolishing ships

83

and almost getting my master killed.

84
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:18,640
Anakin doesn't have much time.
We have to find help tonight.

85
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:25,146
Okay, you and Bly go south.
Rex and I will stay here with Anakin.

No, Ahsoka.

87
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,776
In order to get help quickly,
we must work together.

88
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,361
I can't leave him.

89
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,490
Master, I know if I was hurt,
he'd never leave me behind.

90
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,701
I know this is hard, Ahsoka.

91
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,996
But Anakin has to stay behind,
and we have to go now.

92
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,165
There is nothing more we can do for him.

93
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,004
We must do all we can
to get off of this planet.

94
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,799
As a Jedi, it is your duty
to do what is best for the group.

95
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,980
General Secura, look.

96
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,484
We're not the only ones
here on this planet.

100
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,874
where exactly are we going?

101
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,376
To go find the people
who live on this planet.

102
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,838
Where are we going to find them?
We have no idea where they are.

103
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:37,719
It seems to me that the people
we're looking for live near giant trees.

00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,097
Very perceptive, Padawan.

105

your attachment to him.

114
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:28,061
It's just... I get so confused sometimes.

115
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,272
It's forbidden for Jedi
to form attachments,

yet we are supposed to be compassionate.

117
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,444
It is nothing to be ashamed of, Ahsoka.

00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,490

00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,331
I realized that for the greater good,
I had to let him go.

Don't lose a thousand lives
just to save one.

We are peacekeepers.
We are Jedi from the Galactic Republic.

We're fighting for freedom.

The other must stay as insurance.

169
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,297
We wouldn't want a surprise attack
on our village

170
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,924
or the kidnapping of our only healer.

171
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,763
Bly and I will stay.
Padawan, go and help your master.

172
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:41,684
No! The clone and his blaster cannot stay.
He will go with the youngling.

173
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,978
I can handle it. I don't need help.

174
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,105
-Ahsoka!
-Don't worry.

175
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:50,818
Be mindful of your surroundings, Padawan,
those creatures are still out there.

176
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,530
Got it. We won't be long.

177
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,886
-Here, it will restore your energy.
-Thank you.

178
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,934
I'm sure you are aware that
the Jedi did not initiate the Clone Wars.

179
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:27,855
Our only intention is to end it
and restore peace to our galaxy.

180
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:34,278
What difference does it make who started
the war and who only wants to end it?

181
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,241
No side is free of fault.
It takes two to fight.

182
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:42,912
-But isn't liberty worth fighting for?
-But is it worth killing for?

183
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,873
Fighting for something
doesn't necessarily mean

184
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,626
you have to destroy everything
in your path.

185
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,714
Only when you lay your arms down
and pursue a course of non-violence

186
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,885
can you make this claim to me
that the Jedi are peacekeepers.

188
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,246
General, you need to maintain your rest.

189
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,415
I can't rest!

190
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:32,753
Rex, they're coming. I can hear them.
We must fight.

No, don't!

193
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,957
Fine.

194
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,972
Good work, little guy.

196
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,393
Master!

197
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,483
Good to see you, Snips.

198
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:41,030
This is Wag Too, he's a healer.
He can make you well again.

199
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,866
Don't you worry. I can fix you right up.

200
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,301
Um...

201
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,178
Snips?

202
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,435
The oil from the pods
will aid in the healing process.

203
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,525
Don't worry, you'll be well in no time.

204
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,162
-You were right all along, Master Secura.
-About what?

<font color="#404040">AHSOKA:</font> If I had stayed with Anakin,

206
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,501
we probably wouldn't have found
this village in time to save him.

207
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,340
At least this whole ordeal is over now.

208
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,929
We still have to find a way off this planet.

209
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:52,268
Well, I'm sure Admiral Yularen
and the Republic fleet are looking for us.

210
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,688
It shouldn't take them too long
to get here.

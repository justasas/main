1
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,312
<i>Jedi form rebel alliance!</i>

2
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:23,444
<i>Led by Anakin Skywalker,</i>

3
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:25,815
<i>the Jedi have trained a band of rebels</i>

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,185
<i>to fight the Separatists
on the planet Onderon.</i>

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,354
<i>With the help of the Jedi,
the rebels escape capture</i>

6
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:35,824
<i>and infiltrated the heavily
fortified city of Iziz.</i>

7
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:38,559
<i>Now our heroes
have launched an armed campaign</i>

8
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:41,729
<i>to subvert the Separatist
occupation of the planet.</i>

9
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:44,731
<i>The Jedi Council
continue to observe and advise</i>

10
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:46,832
<i>as the rebels strive to gain momentum</i>

11
00:00:46,866 --> 00:00:49,001
<i>against the Separatist forces.</i>

12
00:00:49,036 --> 00:00:51,636
<i>Despite the absence
of civilian casualties,</i>

13
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:53,305
<i>public fear has ensued</i>

14
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:55,572
<i>as reports
of the rebels' daring strikes</i>

15
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,908
<i>circulate throughout the city.</i>

16
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,119
Your identification failed.

17
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,320
That's not possible.

18
00:01:13,354 --> 00:01:16,756
You are coming with us.

19
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:18,791
Hey!

20
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:22,460
- What's going on?
- No!

21
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:01,655
The rebels are attacking again.

22
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:04,958
That is the fifth time this rotation.

23
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:11,930
That should give King Rash
something to think about.

24
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,832
Huh, I'm sure
you've gotten his attention.

25
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,982
Dendup has been summoned
and awaits your order, my lord.

26
00:02:37,016 --> 00:02:39,584
What about the terrorists?

27
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:41,886
They've attacked
a checkpoint near the canal

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,155
and two droid patrols,

29
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:46,189
one in Malgan Market.

30
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,158
If they think destroying a few droids

31
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:52,795
is going to effect change,
they've run a fool's errand.

32
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,696
One more thing, my lord.

33
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,965
The royal carriage was ambushed

34
00:02:57,999 --> 00:03:00,234
soon after it left the residence.

35
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:04,204
Hmm, an attempt on my life.

36
00:03:04,238 --> 00:03:06,137
It appears that way.

37
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,941
Get my predecessor in here.

38
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,217
You surprise me.

39
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,586
Engaging with extremists
is beneath you.

40
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,923
Do you really want
your crown back that badly?

41
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,161
I only want freedom for my people.

42
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:39,429
Hmm.

43
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:42,097
Your supporters are responsible
for terrorist acts

44
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:44,599
against the kingdom and our allies.

45
00:03:44,633 --> 00:03:46,534
I didn't know that.

46
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,571
You've made it quite impossible
to stay informed of anything

47
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:53,006
outside my prison chamber.

48
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:57,076
Call off the attacks.

49
00:03:57,143 --> 00:04:00,212
I cannot call off
what I did not dictate.

50
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,080
What you are up against

51
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,583
is simply the will of the people.

52
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:09,452
It's up to the king
to embrace, bend, or break it.

53
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:12,288
And I am no longer the king.

54
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:14,889
Stop the attacks,

55
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:17,791
or you will atone with your life.

56
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:21,362
It is you that must end the attacks

57
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:24,530
by ending the droid occupation.

58
00:05:12,268 --> 00:05:14,468
Your success will not go unnoticed.

59
00:05:16,572 --> 00:05:20,473
I agree, but we need to be
mindful of public perception.

60
00:05:20,507 --> 00:05:22,541
What was your observation, Padawan?

61
00:05:22,575 --> 00:05:25,143
The people were fearful, Master.

62
00:05:25,177 --> 00:05:26,510
Indeed.

63
00:05:26,544 --> 00:05:28,612
Judging from the reactions
I saw today,

64
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:31,915
I'm afraid they will mistake
your intentions.

65
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:33,417
We need to do more damage.

66
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:36,753
A few dozen broken-down droids
will do little to free Onderon.

67
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:39,355
The people need to believe
we can succeed.

68
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,791
Without their support,
our efforts are meaningless.

69
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,960
If they're afraid,
they won't support us.

70
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,362
We need to assure them
of our intentions.

71
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:48,730
I don't understand.
Why are they afraid?

72
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,398
They're afraid
we're not strong enough to win.

73
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:53,433
We need to earn their trust.

74
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,236
You'll have plenty of time
to earn their trust.

75
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,071
All of you are going to be very busy.

76
00:05:58,105 --> 00:06:00,405
Today was only a taste.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,273
You'll get your chance.

78
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:06,978
In the meantime,
make the most of your victories.

79
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,446
Welcome and learn from them.

80
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,949
Perhaps if we hit something big,

81
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:13,916
gave a show of strength,

82
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:16,217
they will overcome their fear
and join us.

83
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:18,219
Do you have something in mind?

84
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:21,152
I know the perfect target.

85
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,494
I think they're ready to give
the 501 some competition.

86
00:06:27,528 --> 00:06:29,895
Let's not get carried away, General,

87
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:32,331
though these rebels have impressed me.

88
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:35,065
We will share the developments
with the Jedi Council.

89
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,000
Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor.

90
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:41,603
Monitor them and report back
with their progress.

91
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,304
Are you up for it, Snips?

92
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,939
Or would you like
to return to Coruscant?

93
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,108
No, Master.

94
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,442
I want to stay.

95
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:50,776
Good.

96
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,845
We should continue
to provide supplies and credits,

97
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,880
but they must learn
to operate on their own.

98
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,049
Their survival depends on it.

99
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,917
Yes, Master.

100
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,952
Remember your purpose.

101
00:07:24,993 --> 00:07:28,895
This power generator feeds
substations across the city.

102
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:32,265
We hit that, the entire grid falls.

103
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,866
How does that help us?

104
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,601
Battle droids are no longer
linked to central control.

105
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,470
They operate individually.

106
00:07:38,504 --> 00:07:41,305
Yes, but they still need power
to recharge.

107
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:42,940
If we take out this facility,

108
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:44,775
it will knock out the power grid,

109
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,411
and then it will only be
a matter of time

110
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,946
until the droid army
is brought to a standstill,

111
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,113
literally.

112
00:07:50,147 --> 00:07:51,914
If you carry the plan out
by nightfall,

113
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:54,649
you'll maximize
your strike capability.

114
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,218
Okay, so we just need to figure out

115
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,552
how to destroy the power station.

116
00:07:58,586 --> 00:08:01,689
We need to do more surveillance.

117
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:03,890
Those droids should have
all the intel we need

118
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:06,191
stored up in those tin cans
of theirs, right?

119
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,492
They should.

120
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,094
Then I'll get us one.

121
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,544
Hey, clanker.

122
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,650
Uh-oh.

123
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,726
Sentries at every access point,

124
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,494
inside and out.

125
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,597
We can't sustain combat
against their numbers.

126
00:08:56,631 --> 00:09:00,533
But our size makes us perfect
for mobility and surprise.

127
00:09:00,568 --> 00:09:02,868
We need something with heavy firepower

128
00:09:02,902 --> 00:09:05,237
if we are to blow up this facility.

129
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,071
If we give them enough trouble,

130
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:09,373
they'll call for reinforcements.

131
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:10,707
Like a tank.

132
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:11,941
Exactly.

133
00:09:11,976 --> 00:09:15,010
Then you can provide cover
while we hijack it.

134
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:18,246
And then we use
their own weapon against them.

135
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,850
And we bring the droid army
to its knees.

136
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,292
Shh.

137
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,538
Remember the plan.

138
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,773
We attack this patrol,

139
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:54,609
and hopefully they will
call in a tank for backup.

140
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:19,096
Ah!

141
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,163
Let's go.

142
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,306
Patrol 118 to central.

143
00:10:36,141 --> 00:10:37,709
We've been ambushed by terrorists

144
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:39,609
and need reinforcements.

145
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:42,811
Let's hope they send a tank.

146
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:46,816
Hear that?

147
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:48,083
They've sent destroyers.

148
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:49,151
Move!

149
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:08,529
We're not gonna last unless
we take out those destroyers.

150
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,031
We have to get behind them.

151
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:11,065
Let's go.

152
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,249
Roll it slow so it gets through.

153
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:36,350
I know that.

154
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:39,419
Nice job.

155
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:40,786
You screwed me up.

156
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,868
Thanks.

157
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:07,306
I've never seen a destroyer
taken out that way before.

158
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,874
We all have to adapt.

159
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,880
There's our tank.

160
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,351
Split up.

161
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:51,210
Let's move.

162
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,969
Good work.

163
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,104
Now, let's get this thing
up and running again.

164
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:43,283
What are you waiting for?

165
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:44,650
Give me a second.

166
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:46,018
Do you know what you're doing?

167
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:49,521
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

168
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:51,156
You boys having a problem?

169
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:53,223
No. No problem. Why?

170
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:55,325
Well, come on.
We need to get moving.

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,160
Hey, who put you in charge?

172
00:13:57,195 --> 00:13:58,227
All right.

173
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:59,962
Get out of the tank, hotshot.

174
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:02,029
This needs a woman's touch.

175
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:04,164
Fine. Be my guest.

176
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,965
We need to get to that power generator

177
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,300
before they realize
this tank's gone missing.

178
00:14:08,334 --> 00:14:10,401
We're running out of time.

179
00:14:11,737 --> 00:14:13,537
I was gonna do that.

180
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:15,772
Uh-huh. Sure.

181
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,211
Couldn't have done it better myself.

182
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:24,012
Now, that's the truth.

183
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:48,343
I'll draw their fire.

184
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:49,378
Good luck.

185
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,446
Good luck.

186
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
I'll cover you.

187
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,667
We're almost in position.

188
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,202
Ready when you are, Steela.

189
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:23,773
A sniper. Get her.

190
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:25,608
Roger, roger.

191
00:15:50,528 --> 00:15:52,728
Look.
We have reinforcements.

192
00:15:54,631 --> 00:15:56,297
Hey, you're not a droid.

193
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,032
Get down from there.

194
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:19,415
Fire the gun.

195
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:21,016
The gun is recharging.

196
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,592
You're all clear.

197
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:58,345
Looks like all that training
is paying off.

198
00:17:04,283 --> 00:17:09,153
My lord, without power,
the droids will be massacred.

199
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:13,055
This loss will work for us.

200
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,168
There's been a power outage.

201
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:31,037
I've lost contact with command.

202
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,505
Switch to infrared.

203
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:34,906
Aah!

204
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,529
- It's the rebels.
- Fight for Onderon!

205
00:17:39,544 --> 00:17:40,811
They're destroying the droids!

206
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:43,547
- Free Onderon!
- Freedom!

207
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,781
Fight for freedom!

208
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:46,148
Get the droids!

209
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:47,816
Freedom!
Freedom!

210
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,826
For freedom!
For Onderon!

211
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,232
- Yeah!
- Yes!

212
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,999
For freedom!
For Onderon!

213
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,741
Show those droids what we're worth.

214
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,409
We must celebrate.

215
00:18:24,443 --> 00:18:25,977
With pleasure.

216
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:34,083
Come here, you handsome senator.

217
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,422
<i>Steela is a born leader.</i>

218
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,890
<i>And quite courageous, I hear.</i>

219
00:18:44,693 --> 00:18:46,926
<i>Ahsoka, remember what I told you</i>

220
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,728
<i>about staying focused.</i>

221
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:50,628
I can't help it, Master.

222
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:51,896
<i>I understand.</i>

223
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,230
You do?

224
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,230
<i>I do.</i>

225
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,732
<i>But try to remember,</i>

226
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>always put purpose
ahead of your feelings.</i>

227
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,701
<i>This latest development</i>

228
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:02,102
<i>will surely get
Count Dooku's attention.</i>

229
00:19:02,136 --> 00:19:04,504
<i>He will respond harshly.</i>

230
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,672
<i>They will stop at nothing to find you.</i>

231
00:19:06,706 --> 00:19:09,074
<i>You must adapt
and continue to confront them</i>

232
00:19:09,108 --> 00:19:10,875
<i>in order to liberate Onderon.</i>

233
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:11,909
We will.

234
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,344
And we shall win.

235
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,445
<i>In that, I have no doubt.</i>

236
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,747
<i>Now you must rally the people.</i>

237
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,748
<i>You will need their support.</i>

238
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:21,249
<i>Your ability to influence them</i>

239
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:25,019
<i>will also determine
your capacity to represent them</i>

240
00:19:25,053 --> 00:19:27,054
<i>not only on the battlefield
but off of it</i>

241
00:19:27,088 --> 00:19:30,524
<i>against your enemies,
even within your own ranks.</i>

242
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,825
<i>Your commitment will inspire others.</i>

243
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:35,294
<i>Your conviction will lead to victory.</i>

244
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:36,628
<i>After tonight's efforts,</i>

245
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:38,364
<i>the people will be ready to follow.</i>

246
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:41,400
<i>You will need a leader
for them to rally behind.</i>

247
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,040
They are waging a very public war.

248
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:51,209
Every trespass is an embarrassment.

249
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:57,047
<i>Your forces cannot manage
a small band of terrorists?</i>

250
00:19:57,081 --> 00:20:00,383
My lord, your droids
have become ineffective

251
00:20:00,418 --> 00:20:02,719
against the mounting rebel attacks.

252
00:20:02,753 --> 00:20:05,554
<i>I thought I could trust you
to rule Onderon.</i>

253
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:09,590
<i>I find this report most disappointing.</i>

254
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:15,594
It seems that the rebels
are far more organized

255
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:17,362
than they were in the past.

256
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:20,331
The attack against the power
generators proves that.

257
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:23,332
Perhaps it's time you send me
better reinforcements

258
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,134
than the droids I have.

259
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:27,502
<i>I will grant you this request</i>

260
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:30,171
<i>and not only send you better droids</i>

261
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:32,139
<i>but a better general.</i>

262
00:20:32,174 --> 00:20:33,841
<i>This is Kalani.</i>

263
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,311
<i>I assure you he will succeed
where you have failed.</i>

264
00:20:41,814 --> 00:20:44,048
We need to build on our momentum

265
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:47,084
and continue our attacks
to keep them off balance.

266
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,253
We have to assure the people first.

267
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,021
If we keep disrupting their lives,

268
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:52,922
we risk alienating them.

269
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:55,325
We have to gain their trust.

270
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,026
I agree with both of you.

271
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,894
We can balance both.

272
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,030
We also need to recruit others
to join us.

273
00:21:02,065 --> 00:21:03,933
Onderon is ours.

274
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,667
We will remind everyone

275
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,268
and keep reminding them

276
00:21:07,303 --> 00:21:08,936
until we get it back.

277
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,537
- Onderon is ours!
- Onderon is ours!

278
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:12,706
- Free Onderon!
- Onderon!

279
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,339
For freedom!

280
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,511
All in favor of Steela as our leader,

281
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:23,946
raise your hand.

282
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:28,850
Okay.

283
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,250
Looks like it's been decided.

284
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:32,052
You're the leader.

285
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,488
Saw.

286
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:36,589
Let him go.

287
00:21:36,623 --> 00:21:38,057
He just needs to blow off some steam.

288
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:39,057
He'll be back.

289
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,659
I can't.

290
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:44,561
Why?

291
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,497
He's my brother.

1
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,460
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:51,212
They shut down the main reactor.

3
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,922
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,006
This is madness.

5
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,309
We're doomed.

6
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:12,608
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,860
What's that?

8
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,715
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,899
At last!

10
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,776
Where have you been?

11
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,069
They're heading in this direction.

12
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,987
What are we going to do?

13
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,864
We'll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,

14
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,616
smashed into who knows what!

15
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:29,453
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

16
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,343
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

17
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,096
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

18
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,015
What have you done with those plans?

19
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,977
We intercepted no transmissions.

20
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,854
This is a consular ship.

21
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,064
We're on a diplomatic mission.

22
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,400
If this is a consular ship,

23
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,777
where is the ambassador?

24
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,617
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans,

25
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,787
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

26
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,801
There's one. Set for stun.

27
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,184
She'll be all right.

28
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,186
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

29
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,439
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

30
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,317
You'll be deactivated for sure.

31
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,653
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher,

32
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,905
you overweight glob of grease!

33
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,656
Now come out before somebody sees you.

34
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,911
Secret mission? What plans?

35
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,329
What are you talking about?

36
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,955
I'm not getting in there.

37
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,502
I'm going to regret this.

38
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,385
There goes another one.

39
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,888
Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

40
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,431
It must have short-circuited.

41
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:16,894
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

42
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,896
Are you sure this thing is safe?

43
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,024
Oh.

44
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,627
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

45
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,963
The Imperial Senate
will not sit still for this.

46
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,339
When they hear
you've attacked a diplomatic-

47
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,924
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

48
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,510
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

49
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,722
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

50
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,684
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

51
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

52
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,897
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

53
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,859
You are part of the Rebel
Alliance and a traitor.

54
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,569
Take her away!

55
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,366
Holding her is dangerous.

56
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,868
If word of this gets out,

57
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,870
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the senate.

58
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,581
I've traced the rebel spies to her.

59
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,375
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

60
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,878
She'll die before she'll tell you anything.

61
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,379
Leave that to me.

62
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,881
Send a distress signal,

63
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,383
and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed.

64
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,177
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship,

65
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,721
and no transmissions were made.

66
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,348
An escape pod was jettisoned
during the fighting,

67
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,017
but no life-forms were aboard.

68
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,895
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

69
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,773
Send a detachment down to retrieve them-
See to it personally, Commander.

70
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,401
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

71
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes, sir.

72
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,877
How did we get into this mess?

73
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,671
I really don't know how.

74
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,381
We seem to be made to suffer.

75
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,841
It's our lot in life.

76
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:16,263
I've got to rest before I fall apart.

77
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,349
My joints are almost frozen.

78
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,899
What a desolate place this is!

79
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,905
Where do you think you're going?

80
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,698
Well, I'm not going that way.

81
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,408
It's much too rocky.

82
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,369
This way is much easier.

83
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,414
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

84
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,459
Don't get technical with me.

85
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,837
What mission? What are you talking about?

86
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,300
I've just about had enough of you.

87
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,802
Go that way.

88
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,804
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,

89
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,472
you nearsighted scrap pile.

90
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,975
And don't let me catch you following me
begging for help,

91
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:02,559
because you won't get it.

92
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,325
No more adventures.

93
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,411
I'm not going that way.

94
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,698
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

95
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,492
He tricked me into going this way,

96
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,494
but he'll do no better.

97
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,875
Wait! What's that?

98
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:09,376
A transport.

99
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,170
I'm saved!

100
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,005
Over here!

101
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,966
Hey!

102
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:19,595
Help! Please help!

103
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,722
R2?

104
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,771
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

105
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,265
Someone was in the pod.

106
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,059
The tracks go off in this direction.

107
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,103
Look, sir, droids.

108
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,328
We stopped.

109
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,121
Wake up! Wake up!

110
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,046
We're doomed.

111
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,972
Do you think they'll melt us down?

112
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,738
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

113
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,490
Will this never end?

114
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,824
All right, fine. Let's go.

115
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,076
Luke! Luke!

116
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,874
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,

117
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,501
be sure it speaks Bocce.

118
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,129
Doesn't look like we have much of a choice,
but I'll remind him.

119
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,641
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

120
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,810
No, not that one.

121
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,232
I suppose you're
programmed for etiquette and protocol.

122
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,733
Protocol? Why, it's my
primary function, sir.

123
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,319
I am well-versed in all the customs-

124
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,071
I have no need for a protocol droid.

125
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,739
Of course you haven't, sir.

126
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:56,074
Not in an environment such as this.

127
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:57,325
That is why I have been programmed-

128
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,746
What I really need is a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

129
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:05,167
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters,

130
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,835
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

131
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,295
Can you speak Bocce?

132
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,964
Of course I can, sir.
It's like a second language to me-

133
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,175
Yeah, all right.
Shut up. I'll take this one.

134
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,759
Luke!

135
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,472
Take these two over to
the garage, will you?

136
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,764
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

137
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,434
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

138
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,604
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

139
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,689
Now come on. Get to it.

140
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,941
All right. Come on.

141
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,696
And the red one. Come on.

142
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,408
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

143
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,886
Uncle Owen!

144
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,387
Yeah?

145
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,224
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

146
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,726
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

147
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,522
Excuse me, sir,

148
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:12,275
but that R2 unit is in prime condition,
a real bargain.

149
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,694
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

150
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,154
What about that blue one?

151
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,573
We'll take that one.

152
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,866
Take this away.

153
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,409
You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.

154
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,538
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

155
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,622
Here he comes.

156
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,835
O.K. Let's go.

157
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,796
Now, don't you forget this.

158
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,716
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

159
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,932
Thank the maker!

160
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,101
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

161
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,813
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination,

162
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,022
I can barely move.

163
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,148
It just isn't fair.

164
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,858
Oh, Biggs is right.

165
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,236
I'm never gonna get out of here.

166
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,363
Is there anything I might do to help?

167
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,865
No. Not unless you can alter time,

168
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,368
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

169
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,078
I don't think so, sir.

170
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,081
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things,

171
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,916
not on this planet, anyway.

172
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,420
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

173
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,922
Well, if there's
a bright center to the universe,

174
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,466
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

175
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:19,718
I see, sir.

176
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,553
You can call me Luke.

177
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,054
I see, Sir Luke.

178
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,389
Ha ha.

179
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,640
Just Luke.

180
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,561
Oh... And I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

181
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,063
This is my counterpart... R2-D2.

182
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,398
Hello.

183
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,901
You got a lot of carbon scoring.

184
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,112
Looks like you boys have
seen a lot of action.

185
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,697
With all we've been through,

186
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,699
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are,

187
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,242
what with the rebellion and all.

188
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,244
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

189
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,413
That's how we came to be in your service,

190
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,914
if you take my meaning, sir.

191
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,124
Have you been in many battles?

192
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,584
Several, I think.

193
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,210
Actually, there's not much to tell.

194
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,131
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

195
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,592
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

196
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,677
Well, my little friend,

197
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,597
you got something jammed in here real good.

198
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,098
Were you on a Star Cruiser or-

199
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,602
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

200
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,771
What's this?

201
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,856
"What is what"? He asked you a question.

202
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,982
What is that?

203
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,484
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

204
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,736
You're my only hope.

205
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,158
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

206
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,993
You're my only hope.

207
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,414
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

208
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,958
Old data. Pay it no mind.

209
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:36,461
Who is she? She's beautiful.

210
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,923
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

211
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,425
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

212
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,260
A person of some importance, I believe.

213
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,428
Our captain was attached-

214
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,763
Is there any more to this recording?

215
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,183
Behave yourself, R2.

216
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,102
You're going to get us into trouble.

217
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,979
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

218
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,152
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi,

219
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,737
a resident of these parts,

220
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,656
and it's a private message for him.

221
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,741
Quite frankly, sir,
I don't know what he's talking about.

222
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,827
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

223
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,412
But with all we've been through,

224
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,581
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

225
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,835
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

226
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,587
I beg your pardon, sir,
but do you know what he's talking about?

227
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,589
I don't know any Obi-Wan,

228
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,093
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

229
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,970
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

230
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,513
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

231
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,098
I wonder who she is.

232
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,182
Sounds like she's in trouble.

233
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,268
I better play back the whole thing.

234
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:40,150
He says the restraining bolt
has short-circuited his recording system.

235
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,069
He suggests that if you remove the bolt,

236
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,488
he might be able to play
back the entire recording.

237
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,991
Oh, yeah. Well...

238
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,870
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

239
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:52,996
O.K...

240
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,500
There you go.

241
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,627
Wait a minute. Where'd she go?

242
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,213
Bring her back. Play
back the entire message.

243
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,423
"What message"?

244
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,717
The one you've just been playing!

245
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,844
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

246
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,054
Luke! Luke!

247
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,598
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

248
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,183
I'm sorry, sir,

249
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,102
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

250
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,854
Here. See what you can do with him.

251
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,606
I'll be right back.

252
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,153
Just you reconsider playing
that message for him.

253
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,656
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

254
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,117
No, I don't like you, either.

255
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,002
You know, I think that R2 unit we bought
might have been stolen.

256
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,713
What makes you think that?

257
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:46,257
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

258
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,344
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

259
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,640
I thought he might have meant old Ben.

260
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,225
Do you know what he's talking about?

261
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,184
Mm-mm.

262
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,521
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

263
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,397
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

264
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:06,486
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit
to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

265
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,571
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

266
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,034
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

267
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,118
He won't.

268
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,621
I don't think he exists anymore.

269
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,123
He died about the same time
as your father.

270
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,500
He knew my father?

271
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,293
I told you to forget it.

272
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:26,840
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

273
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:30,844
In the morning, I want them up there on the
south ridge working on those condensers.

274
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,011
Yes, sir.

275
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:36,015
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

276
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,853
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

277
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,189
about me staying on another season?

278
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:45,483
And if these new droids do work out,

279
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,527
I want to transmit my application
to the academy this year.

280
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,405
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

281
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,323
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

282
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,450
Harvest is when I need you the most.

283
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,578
It's only one season more.

284
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,998
This year we'll make enough on the harvest
that I'll be able to hire more hands

285
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:03,042
and then you can
go to the academy next year.

286
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:04,878
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

287
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,796
But it's a whole 'nother year!

288
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,172
Look, it's only one more season.

289
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,508
Yeah, that's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

290
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:11,551
Where are you going?

291
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,802
Looks like I'm going nowhere.

292
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,804
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

293
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:16,848
Owen, he can't stay here forever.

294
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,266
Most of his friends have gone.

295
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,476
It means so much to him.

296
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,353
I'll make it up to him next year.

297
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:23,479
I promise.

298
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,983
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.

299
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,110
He has too much of his father in him.

300
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,279
That's what I'm afraid of.

301
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,495
Ooh!

302
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,913
What are you doing hiding back there?

303
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,416
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

304
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,378
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

305
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,046
Kept babbling on about his mission.

306
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,798
Oh, no.

307
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,558
That R2 unit has always
been a problem.

308
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,186
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

309
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,271
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

310
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:48,856
How could I be so stupid?

311
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,316
He's nowhere in sight.

312
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:51,442
Blast it!

313
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,153
Pardon me, sir,
but couldn't we go after him?

314
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,947
It's too dangerous
with all the Sandpeople around.

315
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,448
We'll have to wait until morning.

316
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,659
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

317
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,953
All right! I'll be there in a few minutes.

318
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,538
Boy, am I gonna get it.

319
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,499
That little droid's going to
cause me a lotta trouble.

320
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,002
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

321
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,504
Come on.

322
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,179
Luke?

323
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,435
Luke!

324
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,443
Have you seen Luke this morning?

325
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,653
He said he had some things to do
before he started today,

326
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:36,946
so he left early.

327
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,531
Did he take
those two new droids with him?

328
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,033
I think so.

329
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:45,413
Well, he better have those units in the south range
repaired by midday, or there'll be hell to pay.

330
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,498
Lookit, there's a droid on the scanner.

331
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,958
Dead ahead.

332
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:52,170
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

333
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,194
Hey, whoa! Where do you think you're going?

334
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,363
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

335
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,492
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

336
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,328
And don't talk to me of
your mission, either.

337
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,247
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here!

338
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,458
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

339
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,087
What's wrong with him now?

340
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,464
There are several creatures approaching
from the southeast.

341
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,426
Sandpeople, or worse.

342
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:42,428
Come on. Let's go have a look.

343
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,638
Come on!

344
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,018
Well, there are two banthas down there,

345
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,104
but I don't see any... Wait a second.

346
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,605
They're Sandpeople, all right.

347
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,441
I can see one of them now.

348
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,933
Hello, there.

349
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:16,606
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

350
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,068
Oh, don't worry. He'll be all right.

351
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,785
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

352
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,581
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

353
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,418
Ben?

354
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,045
Ben Kenobi?

355
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:41,130
Boy, am I glad to see you.

356
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,258
The Jundland Wastes are not
to be traveled lightly.

357
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,512
Tell me, young Luke,

358
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,515
what brings you out this far?

359
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,309
This little droid.

360
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,938
I think he's searching
for his former master,

361
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:00,441
but I've never seen such devotion
in a droid before.

362
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,195
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

363
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,488
Is he a relative of yours?

364
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,990
Do you know who he's talking about?

365
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,243
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

366
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,996
Obi-Wan.

367
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:19,043
Now, that's a name I've not
heard in a long time.

368
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,587
A long time.

369
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:24,006
I think my uncle knows him.

370
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,633
He said he was dead.

371
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,551
Oh, he's not dead.

372
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,803
Not yet.

373
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,346
You know him?

374
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,349
Well, of course I know him. He's me.

375
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:41,857
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan
since, oh, before you were born.

376
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:43,776
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

377
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,529
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

378
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,615
Very interesting.

379
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,995
I think we better get indoors.

380
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,580
The Sandpeople are easily startled,

381
00:31:56,665 --> 00:32:00,084
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

382
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,338
3PO.

383
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,392
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

384
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,228
Can you stand?

385
00:32:19,313 --> 00:32:21,147
We've got to get out of here
before the Sandpeople return.

386
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,774
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

387
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:26,569
There's no sense
in you risking yourself on my account.

388
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,070
I'm done for.

389
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,947
No, you're not.

390
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,115
What kind of talk is that?

391
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,867
Quickly. They're on the move.

392
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,749
No, my father didn't fight in the wars.

393
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,625
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

394
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,586
That's what your uncle told you.

395
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,504
He didn't hold
with your father's ideals.

396
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,758
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

397
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,801
You fought in the Clone Wars?

398
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,804
Yes. I was once a Jedi knight,

399
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,222
the same as your father.

400
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,560
I wish I'd known him.

401
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:05,149
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy
and a cunning warrior.

402
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,028
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

403
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,031
And he was a good friend.

404
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,283
Which reminds me,

405
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,119
I have something here for you.

406
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:23,626
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough,

407
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,795
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

408
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:31,425
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some
damn-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.

409
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,344
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,

410
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,428
I'll close down for a while.

411
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,138
Sure. Go ahead.

412
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,433
What is it?

413
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,311
It's your father's lightsaber.

414
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:45,689
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

415
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,693
Not as clumsy
or random as a blaster.

416
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:55,658
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

417
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,993
For over a thousand generations,

418
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:03,165
the Jedi knights were the guardians
of peace and justice in the old Republic,

419
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,085
before the dark times,

420
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,795
before the Empire.

421
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,758
How did my father die?

422
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,138
A young Jedi named Darth Vader,

423
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,391
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil,

424
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,520
helped the Empire
hunt down and destroy the Jedi knights.

425
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,732
He betrayed and murdered your father.

426
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:32,778
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

427
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:37,783
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

428
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,410
The Force?

429
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,913
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

430
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:47,084
It's an energy field created
by all living things.

431
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,044
It surrounds us, penetrates us,

432
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,213
it binds the galaxy together.

433
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,765
Now let's see if we can't
figure out what you are, my little friend,

434
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,809
and where you come from.

435
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,603
I saw part of a message he was...

436
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:07,521
I seem to have found it.

437
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:11,859
General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.

438
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,488
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

439
00:35:15,572 --> 00:35:18,616
I regret that I am unable to present my
father's request to you in person.

440
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,493
But my ship has fallen under attack,

441
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:22,912
and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

442
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:28,501
I have placed information vital to the survival of the
rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

443
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,419
My father will know how to retrieve it.

444
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:34,840
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

445
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,675
This is our most desperate hour.

446
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,846
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

447
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:59,865
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

448
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,409
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.

449
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,454
I've got to get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

450
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,332
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

451
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,585
I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

452
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,007
I can't get involved.

453
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,510
I've got work to do.

454
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,179
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it,

455
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:25,516
but there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

456
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,768
It's all such a long way from here.

457
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,853
That's your uncle talking.

458
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:31,188
My uncle.

459
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,816
How am I ever gonna explain this?

460
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,609
Learn about the Force, Luke.

461
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,910
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

462
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:49,039
You can get a transport there to Mos
Eisley or wherever you're going.

463
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:53,127
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

464
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:02,928
Until this battle station
is fully operational,

465
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,471
we are vulnerable.

466
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,640
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

467
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,726
They're more dangerous than you realize.

468
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,228
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander,

469
00:37:11,313 --> 00:37:13,522
not to this battle station.

470
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:18,152
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate-

471
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,572
The Imperial Senate will no longer be
of any concern to us.

472
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:25,743
I have just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

473
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:30,080
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

474
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:31,624
That's impossible.

475
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,126
How will the emperor
maintain control without the bureaucracy?

476
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,964
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

477
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:43,135
Fear will keep the local systems in line-

478
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,637
fear of this battle station.

479
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,597
And what of the rebellion?

480
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,975
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,

481
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,769
it is possible, however unlikely,

482
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,188
that they might
find a weakness and exploit it.

483
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,525
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

484
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:02,363
Any attack made by the rebels against
this station would be a useless gesture,

485
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,990
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

486
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:08,702
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

487
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,121
I suggest we use it.

488
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:15,000
Don't be too proud of this technological
terror you've constructed.

489
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:20,881
The ability to destroy a planet is
insignificant next to the power of the Force.

490
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:24,426
Don't try to frighten us
with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

491
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:30,057
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion hasn't
helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes

492
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,478
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortre...

493
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:43,237
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

494
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,825
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

495
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,451
As you wish.

496
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,747
This bickering is pointless.

497
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:58,627
Lord Vader will provide us
with the location of the rebel fortress

498
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,547
by the time this station is operational.

499
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:05,551
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

500
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:14,351
It looks like the Sandpeople
did this, all right.

501
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,186
Look. There's gaffi sticks,
Bantha tracks.

502
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,522
It's just, I've never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

503
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,192
They didn't,
but we are meant to think they did.

504
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:24,194
These tracks are side-by-side.

505
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:28,490
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

506
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,909
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

507
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:35,789
And these blast points,
too accurate... for Sandpeople.

508
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:39,501
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

509
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:42,755
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

510
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,846
If they traced the robots here, they may
have learned who they sold them to,

511
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,973
and that would lead them back... home!

512
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,641
Wait, Luke!

513
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,727
It's too dangerous!

514
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:22,044
Uncle Owen!

515
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,588
Aunt Beru!

516
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,048
Uncle Owen!

517
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,557
And now, Your Highness,

518
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:20,936
we will discuss the location
of your hidden rebel base.

519
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:05,606
There's nothing you could have done, Luke,

520
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,274
had you been there.

521
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,109
You'd have been killed, too,

522
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:12,821
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

523
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,617
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

524
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,493
There's nothing for me here now.

525
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:22,456
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

526
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,515
Mos Eisley spaceport.

527
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,854
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

528
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:47,940
We must be cautious.

529
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:31,608
How long have you had these droids?

530
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:32,943
Three or four seasons.

531
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,361
They're up for sale if you want them.

532
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,321
Let me see your identification.

533
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:39,741
You don't need to see his identification.

534
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,202
We don't need to see his identification.

535
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,663
These aren't the droids you're looking for.

536
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,666
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

537
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,168
He can go about his business.

538
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,671
You can go about your business.

539
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,383
Move along.

540
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,652
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

541
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:18,238
Go on, go on.

542
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,992
I can't understand how
we got by those troops.

543
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,493
I thought we were dead.

544
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:27,873
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

545
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,212
Do you really think we're gonna find
a pilot here that'll take us to Alderaan?

546
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:37,257
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here,

547
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,759
only watch your step.

548
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,594
This place can be a little rough.

549
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,804
I'm ready for anything.

550
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:47,851
Come along, R2.

551
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,363
Hey! We don't serve their kind here.

552
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,322
What?

553
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,116
Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.

554
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,367
We don't want them here.

555
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,786
Why don't you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

556
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,788
I heartily agree with you, sir.

557
00:45:58,214 --> 00:45:59,422
Uh...

558
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:00,841
I'll have one of those.

559
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,086
He doesn't like you.

560
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:39,963
I'm sorry.

561
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,674
I don't like you, either.

562
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,593
You just watch yourself.

563
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:45,844
We're wanted men.

564
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,264
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

565
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:50,849
I'll be careful.

566
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,184
You'll be dead!

567
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:54,186
This little one's not worth the effort.

568
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,563
Come, let me get you something.

569
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,405
Aah!

570
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,133
I'm all right.

571
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,806
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

572
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:38,271
I don't like the look of this.

573
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:56,790
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

574
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,252
Chewie here tells me you're looking for
passage to the Alderaan system.

575
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:02,671
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

576
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,674
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?

577
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,260
Should I have?

578
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,513
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

579
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,725
I've outrun imperial starships.

580
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,894
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

581
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,146
I'm talking about the big
Corellian ships now.

582
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,276
She's fast enough for you, old man.

583
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,027
What's the cargo?

584
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:29,239
Only passengers... myself, the boy,

585
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,865
two droids,

586
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,910
and no questions asked.

587
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:37,038
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

588
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:42,294
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

589
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:46,172
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

590
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,550
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

591
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,137
10,000, all in advance.

592
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,140
10,000?

593
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:59,019
We could almost
buy our own ship for that!

594
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,354
But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?

595
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,523
You bet I could.
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.

596
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,026
We don't have to sit here and listen-

597
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:12,365
We can pay you 2,000 now
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

598
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,326
Seventeen, huh?

599
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:20,290
O.K. You guys got yourselves a ship.

600
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,666
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.

601
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:22,876
Docking Bay 94.

602
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,169
Ninety-four.

603
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:30,633
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

604
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,886
All right. We'll check it out.

605
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:46,149
17,000!

606
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,817
Those guys must really be desperate.

607
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:49,986
This could really save my neck.

608
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:52,739
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

609
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,407
You'll have to sell your speeder.

610
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,911
That's O.K. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

611
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,538
Going somewhere, Solo?

612
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,666
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

613
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:05,960
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

614
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:10,507
It's too late. You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

615
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:14,052
Jabba's put a price on
your head so large...

616
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,097
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you.

617
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,224
I'm lucky I found you first.

618
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:21,476
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

619
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,146
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

620
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:28,566
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba-

621
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:31,152
Jabba's through with you.

622
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,780
He has no time for smugglers...

623
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,533
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

624
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:40,370
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

625
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:44,582
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

626
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:46,876
Over my dead body.

627
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:48,128
That's the idea.

628
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:52,215
I've been looking forward to this
for a long time.

629
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,633
I'll bet you have.

630
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,315
Sorry about the mess.

631
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:21,578
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

632
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,747
It'll be some time before we can extract
any information from her.

633
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:26,791
The final checkout is completed.

634
00:51:26,876 --> 00:51:28,418
All systems are operational.

635
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,420
What course shall we set?

636
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,215
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

637
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,717
What do you mean?

638
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:39,554
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

639
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,181
Set your course for Alderaan.

640
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:42,682
With pleasure.

641
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,101
Lock the door, R2.

642
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:49,647
Check this side of the street.

643
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,196
The door's locked. Move on to the next.

644
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:05,747
I would much rather have gone
with Master Luke than stay here with you.

645
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,166
I don't know what
all this trouble is about,

646
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,959
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

647
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,337
You watch your language.

648
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,592
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

649
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:19,052
Look at this.

650
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,304
Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren't in demand.

651
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,889
It'll be enough.

652
00:52:41,784 --> 00:52:44,869
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

653
00:52:46,372 --> 00:52:47,914
Right here, Jabba.

654
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,917
I've been waitin' for you.

655
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,961
Have you now.

656
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,214
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

657
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:02,095
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

658
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,264
Why haven't you paid me...

659
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,767
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

660
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,520
Look, Jabba, next time you want to
talk to me, come see me yourself.

661
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,146
Don't send one of these twerps.

662
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,775
Han, I can't make exceptions.

663
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,736
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

664
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:21,406
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

665
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,158
of an imperial starship?

666
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,411
It's not good business.

667
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:29,497
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

668
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,042
You think I had a choice?

669
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,961
But I got a nice, easy charter.

670
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,380
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.

671
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,382
I just need a little more time.

672
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:45,054
Han, my boy, you're the best.

673
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,557
So, for an extra 20-

674
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,642
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

675
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:51,811
Okay, 15%.

676
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,063
But if you fail me again...

677
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,066
I'll put a price on your head so big...

678
00:53:57,151 --> 00:54:01,404
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

679
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,990
Jabba... you're a wonderful human being.

680
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:06,909
Come on!

681
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,834
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,

682
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,294
we ought to do well.

683
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,153
What a piece of junk!

684
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,447
She'll make.5 past light speed.

685
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:47,784
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

686
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,620
I've made a lot of
special modifications myself.

687
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:53,206
But we're a little rushed,
so if you'll just get on board,

688
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,749
we'll get outta here.

689
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:00,588
Hello, sir.

690
00:55:09,682 --> 00:55:11,140
Which way?

691
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,061
All right, men, load your weapons.

692
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:19,232
Stop that ship! Blast them!

693
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,284
Chewie, get us out of here!

694
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:36,040
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

695
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:57,145
Looks like an imperial cruiser. Our
passengers must be hotter than I thought.

696
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:58,646
Try and hold 'em off.

697
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:01,733
Angle the deflector shields while I make the
calculations for the jump to light speed.

698
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:15,246
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

699
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,498
Why don't you outrun 'em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

700
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,500
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself floating home.

701
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:23,004
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

702
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,964
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

703
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,095
Here's where the fun begins.

704
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,972
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

705
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,808
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navi computer.

706
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,643
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

707
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,897
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy!

708
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,231
Without precise calculations,

709
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:44,901
we'd fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova,

710
00:56:44,985 --> 00:56:46,944
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

711
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,029
What's that flashing?

712
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,573
We're losing a deflector shield.
Go strap yourselves in.

713
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,533
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

714
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,932
We've entered the Alderaan system.

715
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:17,266
Governor Tarkin.

716
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,812
I should have expected to find you
holding Vader's leash.

717
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:24,565
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

718
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,944
Charming to the last.

719
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:32,824
You don't know how hard I found it
signing the order to terminate your life.

720
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,660
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

721
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,788
Princess Leia, before your execution...

722
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:44,210
I would like you to be my guest at a ceremony
that will make this battle station operational.

723
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,421
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

724
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:49,966
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin,

725
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,802
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

726
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,888
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

727
00:57:55,973 --> 00:58:01,310
In a way, you have determined the choice
of the planet that will be destroyed first.

728
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:06,315
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base,

729
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:12,488
I have chosen to test this station's destructive
power on your home planet of Alderaan.

730
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:13,656
No! Alderaan is peaceful.

731
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,032
We have no weapons. You can't possibly...

732
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:17,493
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

733
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:20,079
Then name the system.

734
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:25,334
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

735
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,087
Where is the rebel base?

736
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,843
Dantooine.

737
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,386
They're on Dantooine.

738
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,889
There. You see, Lord Vader?

739
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,390
She can be reasonable.

740
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,350
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

741
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,935
What?

742
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,395
You're far too trusting.

743
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,608
Dantooine is too remote to make an
effective demonstration, but don't worry.

744
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:51,611
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

745
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:52,778
No!

746
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,198
Commence primary ignition.

747
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,642
Are you all right? What's wrong?

748
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,144
I felt a great
disturbance in the Force,

749
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:30,399
as if millions of voices suddenly cried out
in terror and were suddenly silenced.

750
00:59:30,484 --> 00:59:33,319
I fear something terrible has happened.

751
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,406
You'd better get on with your exercises.

752
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,203
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

753
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,288
I told you I'd outrun them.

754
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,378
Don't everybody thank me at once.

755
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:54,966
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

756
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,266
Now be careful, R2.

757
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,818
Argh!

758
01:00:13,902 --> 01:00:15,736
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

759
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,656
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

760
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,117
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

761
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,788
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's
arms out of their sockets when they lose.

762
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,957
Wookiees are known to do that.

763
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,294
I see your point, sir.

764
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:33,796
I suggest a new strategy, R2.

765
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,381
Let the Wookiee win.

766
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,050
Argh!

767
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:57,486
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

768
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,613
You mean it controls your actions?

769
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,575
Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

770
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:12,001
Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no
match for a good blaster at your side, kid.

771
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,420
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

772
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,798
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

773
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:19,467
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,

774
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:25,473
but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's
one all-powerful force controlling everything.

775
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:29,685
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

776
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,773
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

777
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,776
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

778
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,779
This time, let go your conscious self...

779
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,866
and act on instinct.

780
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:47,328
With the blast shield
down, I can't even see.

781
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,829
How am I supposed to fight?

782
01:01:48,914 --> 01:01:49,914
Your eyes can deceive you.

783
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:51,123
Don't trust them.

784
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:02,843
Stretch out with your feelings.

785
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,443
You see? You can do it.

786
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:21,195
I call it luck.

787
01:02:21,279 --> 01:02:23,906
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

788
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,408
Look, good against remotes is one thing.

789
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,411
Good against the living,
that's something else.

790
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,456
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

791
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,128
You know, I did feel something.

792
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,420
I could almost see the remote.

793
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:43,342
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

794
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:48,848
Yes?

795
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:51,851
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

796
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:53,853
They found the remains of a rebel base,

797
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:56,313
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

798
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,942
They are now conducting an extensive search
of the surrounding systems.

799
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:03,070
She lied. She lied to us!

800
01:03:03,155 --> 01:03:08,409
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

801
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,703
Terminate her immediately.

802
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,790
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.

803
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:16,333
Cut in the sublight engines.

804
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,171
What the...

805
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:25,676
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

806
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,969
Some kind of asteroid collision.

807
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,262
It's not on any of the charts.

808
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,388
What's going on?

809
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,807
Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.

810
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,184
What do you mean? Where is it?

811
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:36,061
That's what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It
ain't there. It's been totally blown away.

812
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,104
What? How?

813
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,856
Destroyed by the Empire.

814
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,275
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

815
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:42,985
It would take 1,000 ships
with more firepower than-

816
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:46,488
There's another ship coming in.

817
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,615
Maybe they know what happened.

818
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,033
It's an imperial fighter.

819
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:51,660
It followed us!

820
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,829
No. It's a short-range fighter.

821
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:55,915
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

822
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,962
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big trouble.

823
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,131
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

824
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:06,508
It would be as well to let it go.
It's too far out of range.

825
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,593
Not for long.

826
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:14,683
A fighter that size couldn't get this deep
into space on its own.

827
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:17,436
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

828
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,439
Well, he ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

829
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:24,485
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

830
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:27,446
I think I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

831
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:31,075
That's no moon.

832
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,660
It's a space station.

833
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:34,578
It's too big to be a space station.

834
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,334
I have a very bad feeling about this.

835
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:42,211
Turn the ship around.

836
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,505
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse!

837
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,799
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

838
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:53,472
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!

839
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:57,601
Why are we still moving
towards it?!

840
01:04:57,686 --> 01:04:59,520
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

841
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,272
There's got to be something you can do!

842
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:04,233
There's nothing I can do about it, kid. I'm
at full power. I'm gonna have to shut down.

843
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,693
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

844
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,573
You can't win,

845
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,826
but there are alternatives to fighting.

846
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,594
Clear Bay 327.

847
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:35,055
We are opening the magnetic field.

848
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:50,904
To your stations!

849
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:52,323
Come with me.

850
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:59,872
Close all outboard shields.

851
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,291
Yes?

852
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:05,294
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.

853
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:09,715
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

854
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:13,344
They must be trying to
return the stolen plans to the princess.

855
01:06:13,428 --> 01:06:16,388
She may yet be of some use to us.

856
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:25,064
Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9. Release charge.

857
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,068
316, report to control.

858
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,989
There's no one on board, sir.

859
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,825
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

860
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,827
It must be a decoy, sir.

861
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,412
Several of the escape pods
have been jettisoned.

862
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:41,497
Did you find any droids?

863
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,458
No, sir. If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

864
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,085
Send a scanning crew aboard.

865
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,003
I want every part of this ship checked.

866
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:49,088
Yes, sir.

867
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:50,589
I sense something,

868
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,675
a presence I've not felt since-

869
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,723
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked.

870
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:10,776
There's no one here.

871
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,412
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.

872
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:22,788
I use them for smuggling.

873
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,706
I never thought I'd
be smuggling myself in 'em.

874
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,166
This is ridiculous.

875
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,543
Even if I could take off,

876
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:29,128
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

877
01:07:29,212 --> 01:07:30,504
Leave that to me.

878
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:33,465
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

879
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:34,883
Who's the more foolish,

880
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,010
the fool or the fool who follows him?

881
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:38,595
Argh!

882
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,187
The ship's all yours.

883
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,189
If the scanners pick up anything,

884
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,191
report it immediately.

885
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:53,110
All right, let's go.

886
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,460
Hey, down there!

887
01:08:11,463 --> 01:08:13,547
Could you give us a hand with this?

888
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:25,058
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

889
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,478
TK-421, do you copy?

890
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:43,535
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

891
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:02,888
Between his howling and
your blasting everything in sight,

892
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:05,641
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

893
01:09:05,725 --> 01:09:08,393
Bring them on! I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin' around.

894
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:10,521
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

895
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,398
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire imperial network.

896
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:28,789
He says he's found the main controls to the
power beam that's holding the ship here.

897
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,041
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

898
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,379
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

899
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:39,675
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

900
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,636
I don't think you boys can help.

901
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,471
I must go alone.

902
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,014
Whatever you say.

903
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,016
I've done more than I bargained for
on this trip already.

904
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,393
I want to go with you.

905
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:52,104
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

906
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,689
They must be delivered safely,

907
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:56,817
or other star systems
will suffer the same fate as Alderaan.

908
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:00,988
Your destiny lies
along a different path from mine.

909
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,995
The Force will be with you always.

910
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,837
Argh argh argh!

911
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,505
You said it, Chewie.

912
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:22,050
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

913
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,052
Ben is a great man.

914
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,680
Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.

915
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,098
I didn't hear you give any ideas.

916
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,851
Well, anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

917
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:31,893
Who do you think...

918
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,563
What is it?

919
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,732
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

920
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:39,192
He says "I've found her"
and keeps repeating "She's here."

921
01:10:39,277 --> 01:10:42,029
Well, who... who has he found?

922
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:43,071
Princess Leia.

923
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,865
The princess? She's here?!

924
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:45,907
Princess?

925
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,242
Where? Where is she?

926
01:10:47,327 --> 01:10:48,660
Princess? What's going on?

927
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:56,877
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

928
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:04,343
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

929
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:05,469
Oh, no!

930
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:06,928
We've got to do something!

931
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:08,639
What are you talking about?

932
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,974
The droids belong to her.
She's the one in the message.

933
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:12,059
We got to help her.

934
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:14,811
Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.

935
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,271
But he didn't know she was here.

936
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:18,565
Just find a way back into that
detention block.

937
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:19,816
I'm not going anywhere.

938
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:20,817
They're going to execute her.

939
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,529
Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't want to just
wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay?

940
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:27,616
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

941
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,784
But they're gonna kill her!

942
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,535
Better her than me.

943
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:39,670
She's rich.

944
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:42,214
Argh!

945
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,507
Rich?

946
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,175
Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

947
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:48,345
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

948
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:49,513
What?

949
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,181
Well, more well than you can imagine.

950
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:53,642
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

951
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,851
You'll get it.

952
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:55,977
I better.

953
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:57,354
You will.

954
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,189
All right, kid. You better
be right about this.

955
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,315
All right.

956
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
What's your plan?

957
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:02,651
Um...

958
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,446
3PO, hand me those binders there, will you?

959
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,532
O.K.

960
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:10,826
Now... I'm gonna put these on you.

961
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,997
O.K. Han, you... you put those on.

962
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:17,082
Don't worry, Chewie.

963
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:18,750
I think I know what he has in mind.

964
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,670
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking,

965
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:24,589
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

966
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,174
Lock the door.

967
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,510
And hope they don't have blasters.

968
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,345
That isn't very reassuring.

969
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:55,620
517 to scanner control.

970
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,209
316, report to control.

971
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:09,801
53 to upper bay door.

972
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,107
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

973
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:56,932
This is not gonna work.

974
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:58,225
Why didn't you say so before?

975
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,310
I did say so before.

976
01:14:15,326 --> 01:14:18,703
Where are you taking this... thing?

977
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,540
Prisoner transfer
from Cell Block 1138.

978
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,125
I wasn't notified.

979
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,378
I'll have to clear it.

980
01:14:31,509 --> 01:14:32,759
Argh!

981
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,219
Look out! He's loose!

982
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:35,387
He'll tear us all apart!

983
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,555
I'll get him!

984
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:00,871
Look out!

985
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,675
We gotta find out
which cell this princess of yours is in.

986
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,846
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

987
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,184
Uh... Uh, everything's under control.

988
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:24,519
Situation normal.

989
01:15:24,604 --> 01:15:25,854
What happened?

990
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,356
Had a slight weapons malfunction,

991
01:15:28,441 --> 01:15:30,692
but, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now.

992
01:15:30,776 --> 01:15:33,528
We're fine-We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

993
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:34,863
How are you?

994
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:36,865
We're sending a squad up.

995
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,366
Uh, negative, negative!

996
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:42,245
We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.

997
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,205
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

998
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,042
Who is this?
What's your operating number?

999
01:15:47,126 --> 01:15:48,293
Uh...

1000
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:50,670
Boring conversation anyway.

1001
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,632
Luke! We're gonna have company!

1002
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:09,522
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

1003
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:10,523
Huh?

1004
01:16:10,608 --> 01:16:12,192
Oh, the uniform.

1005
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,904
I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

1006
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:17,447
You're who?

1007
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,908
I'm here to rescue you. I've got your
R2 unit. I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

1008
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:21,201
Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?

1009
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,285
Come on!

1010
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,497
He is here.

1011
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,958
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

1012
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,292
What makes you think so?

1013
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,962
A tremor in the Force.

1014
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:35,465
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

1015
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:38,051
Surely he must be dead by now.

1016
01:16:38,135 --> 01:16:41,012
Don't underestimate the Force.

1017
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:42,973
The Jedi are extinct.

1018
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,350
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

1019
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:48,895
You, my friend,
are all that's left of their religion.

1020
01:16:48,980 --> 01:16:50,522
Yes.

1021
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:54,401
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.

1022
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:55,652
The princess?

1023
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:57,070
Put all sections on alert.

1024
01:16:57,154 --> 01:16:58,655
Obi-Wan is here.

1025
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:00,782
The Force is with him.

1026
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:01,908
If you're right,

1027
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,952
he must not be allowed to escape.

1028
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,578
Escape is not his plan.

1029
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,372
I must face him alone.

1030
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:15,964
Argh!

1031
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:18,216
Get behind me! Get behind me!

1032
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:30,729
Watch your left.

1033
01:17:30,813 --> 01:17:32,397
They went down the cell bay.

1034
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,317
Can't get out that way.

1035
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,403
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

1036
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:42,699
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

1037
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,701
C-3PO, C-3PO!

1038
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:45,827
Yes, sir?

1039
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:49,247
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off!

1040
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,668
What was that? I didn't copy.

1041
01:17:53,753 --> 01:17:56,963
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

1042
01:17:57,048 --> 01:17:59,174
The main entrance seems to be
the only way in or out.

1043
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:02,135
All other information on
your level is restricted.

1044
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,762
Open up in there!

1045
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,722
Open up in there!

1046
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,515
Oh, no!

1047
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,225
There isn't any other way out!

1048
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,063
Argh!

1049
01:18:14,774 --> 01:18:16,983
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!

1050
01:18:17,068 --> 01:18:20,612
This is some rescue! You came in here,
and you didn't have a plan for getting out?

1051
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,739
He's the brains, sweetheart!

1052
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,032
Well, I didn't-

1053
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:27,160
What the hell are you doing?

1054
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,245
Somebody has to save our skins.

1055
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,249
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

1056
01:18:40,007 --> 01:18:41,716
Get in there!
Arrgh!

1057
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:45,887
Get in there, you big furry oaf!
I don't care what you smell.

1058
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,890
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

1059
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:52,977
Wonderful girl!

1060
01:18:55,106 --> 01:18:58,316
Either I'm going to kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

1061
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:02,695
Get in there!

1062
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:07,617
Aah!

1063
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:10,537
Ah!

1064
01:19:10,621 --> 01:19:12,163
Argh!

1065
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,751
The garbage chute was a
really wonderful idea.

1066
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:20,463
What an incredible smell you've discovered!

1067
01:19:23,008 --> 01:19:26,177
Let's get out of here.
Get away from there.

1068
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,679
No, wait!

1069
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,855
Will you forget it?! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

1070
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,232
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

1071
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,276
Absolutely, Your Worship.

1072
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,695
Look, I had everything
under control till you led us down here!

1073
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,948
Ya know, it's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us!

1074
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,950
It could be worse.

1075
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:53,955
It's worse.

1076
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:55,582
There's something alive in here.

1077
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,083
That's your imagination.

1078
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:00,003
Something just moved past my leg.

1079
01:20:01,672 --> 01:20:03,756
Look! Did you see that?

1080
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:04,757
What?

1081
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:26,988
Kid!

1082
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:32,911
Luke!

1083
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:37,665
Aah!

1084
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,420
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

1085
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,923
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

1086
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,674
Where?

1087
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:47,759
Anywhere!

1088
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,601
Luke, Luke!

1089
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,001
Help him!

1090
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:23,211
What happened?

1091
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,337
I don't know.

1092
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,756
It just let go of me and disappeared.

1093
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,724
I got a bad feeling about this.

1094
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:42,105
The walls are moving!

1095
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,523
Don't just stand there!

1096
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:46,109
Try and brace it with something.

1097
01:21:53,284 --> 01:21:54,784
Help me!

1098
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:08,506
Wait a minute!

1099
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,969
3PO!

1100
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,430
Come in, 3PO!

1101
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,056
3PO!

1102
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:19,017
Where could he be?

1103
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,690
Take over. See to him.

1104
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,694
Look, there.

1105
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,947
They're madmen.

1106
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:34,282
They're heading for the prison level.

1107
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,950
If you hurry, you might catch them.

1108
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:37,535
Follow me.

1109
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:43,708
You stand guard.

1110
01:22:47,546 --> 01:22:49,213
Come on.

1111
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,218
Oh!

1112
01:22:57,723 --> 01:23:01,142
All this excitement has overrun the
circuits in my counterpart here.

1113
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:04,645
If you don't mind,
I'd like to take him down to maintenance.

1114
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,230
All right.

1115
01:23:18,202 --> 01:23:19,118
3PO!

1116
01:23:19,203 --> 01:23:20,578
Come in, 3PO!

1117
01:23:20,662 --> 01:23:22,121
3PO!

1118
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,623
Get on top!

1119
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:24,874
I can't.

1120
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,835
Where could he be?! 3PO!

1121
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,046
3PO, will you come in!

1122
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,506
They aren't here.

1123
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,882
Something must have happened to them.

1124
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:34,384
See if they've been captured.

1125
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:35,510
Hurry.

1126
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,556
One thing's for sure,

1127
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,100
we're all gonna be a lot thinner.

1128
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:46,854
Get on top of it.

1129
01:23:46,939 --> 01:23:47,980
I'm trying.

1130
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:54,862
Thank goodness they haven't found them.

1131
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:55,988
Where could they be?

1132
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:00,034
"Use the comlink"?

1133
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:02,912
Oh, my. I forgot. I turned it off.

1134
01:24:05,582 --> 01:24:08,209
Are you there, sir?

1135
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,086
3PO!

1136
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,170
We've had some problems.

1137
01:24:11,255 --> 01:24:13,423
Will you shut up and listen to me?!

1138
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:15,550
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level, will ya?!

1139
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:16,634
Do you copy!?

1140
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:23,433
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

1141
01:24:23,517 --> 01:24:25,226
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

1142
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:38,656
What?

1143
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:40,241
Ha ha!

1144
01:24:42,369 --> 01:24:44,745
Listen to them. They're dying, R2!

1145
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,247
Curse my metal body!

1146
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:50,209
I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

1147
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:51,878
We're all right! You did great!

1148
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:56,674
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number... Where are we?

1149
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:00,136
3263827!

1150
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:47,475
If we can just avoid any
more female advice,

1151
01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:49,810
we ought to be able to get outta here.

1152
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,437
Well, let's get moving.

1153
01:25:52,606 --> 01:25:54,524
Where are you going?

1154
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,691
Aw...

1155
01:25:55,776 --> 01:25:57,235
No, wait! They'll hear!

1156
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,321
Come here, you big coward.

1157
01:26:00,405 --> 01:26:01,697
Chewie, come here.

1158
01:26:01,782 --> 01:26:02,865
Listen...

1159
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,576
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

1160
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,621
but from now on, you do as I tell you, O.K?

1161
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:12,667
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

1162
01:26:12,751 --> 01:26:15,586
I take orders from just one person... me.

1163
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,713
It's a wonder you're still alive.

1164
01:26:17,798 --> 01:26:21,092
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

1165
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:24,428
No reward is worth this.

1166
01:26:33,397 --> 01:26:35,606
Give me regular reports, please.

1167
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:36,816
Right.

1168
01:26:38,986 --> 01:26:40,361
Do you know what's going on?

1169
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,280
Maybe it's another drill.

1170
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:48,953
You seen that new VT-16?

1171
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,414
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

1172
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,624
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see-

1173
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,835
What was that?

1174
01:26:55,919 --> 01:26:57,503
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.

1175
01:26:57,588 --> 01:26:58,588
Don't worry about it.

1176
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,052
There she is.

1177
01:27:05,137 --> 01:27:06,345
C-3PO? Do you copy?

1178
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:07,388
Yes, sir.

1179
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:08,472
Are you safe?

1180
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,934
For the moment. We're in the main
hangar across from the ship.

1181
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,521
We're right above you. Stand by.

1182
01:27:15,606 --> 01:27:17,315
You came in that thing?

1183
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:18,482
You're braver than I thought.

1184
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:19,900
Nice! Come on.

1185
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:24,947
It's them!

1186
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:26,282
Blast them!

1187
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:28,618
Get back to the ship!

1188
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:29,744
Where are you going? Come back!

1189
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:30,828
He certainly has courage.

1190
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:34,582
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

1191
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:41,005
Aah!

1192
01:27:58,273 --> 01:27:59,440
Whoop!

1193
01:27:59,524 --> 01:28:02,151
I think we took a wrong turn.

1194
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:07,406
There's no lock.

1195
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,745
That oughta hold them for a while.

1196
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,288
Quick! We've got to get across.

1197
01:28:14,373 --> 01:28:16,165
Find the controls that extend the bridge.

1198
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,667
I think I just blasted it.

1199
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:19,543
They're coming through!

1200
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:42,900
Here, hold this.

1201
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:00,960
Here they come.

1202
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:12,930
For luck.

1203
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,731
We think they may be splitting up.

1204
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:25,109
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

1205
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,749
Where could they be?

1206
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:46,505
Close the blast doors!

1207
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:56,098
Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!

1208
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,869
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.

1209
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:18,496
We meet again at last.

1210
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,707
The circle is now complete.

1211
01:30:21,792 --> 01:30:24,293
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1212
01:30:24,377 --> 01:30:26,462
Now / am the master.

1213
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,507
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1214
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,153
Your powers are weak, old man.

1215
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:52,863
You can't win, Darth.

1216
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:54,907
If you strike me down,

1217
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,369
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1218
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:07,878
You should not have come back.

1219
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:36,323
Didn't we just leave this party?

1220
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:38,909
What kept you?

1221
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,160
We, uh, ran into some old friends.

1222
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,245
The ship all right?

1223
01:31:41,329 --> 01:31:42,830
It seems O.K., if we can get to it.

1224
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,040
I just hope the old man
got the tractor beam out of commission.

1225
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:00,764
Look!

1226
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:06,270
Come on, R2, we're going.

1227
01:32:08,106 --> 01:32:09,231
Now's our chance! Go!

1228
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:14,028
Ben?

1229
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,295
No!

1230
01:32:39,346 --> 01:32:43,015
Come on!

1231
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:44,350
Luke, it's too late!

1232
01:32:44,434 --> 01:32:46,268
Blast the door, kid!

1233
01:32:55,946 --> 01:32:58,280
Obi-Wan... Run, Luke, run!

1234
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:04,954
I hope that old man got that tractor beam out of commission,
or this is gonna be a real short trip. O.K. Hit it!

1235
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,904
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1236
01:33:38,989 --> 01:33:40,447
Hold them off.

1237
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:44,326
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

1238
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,586
I can't believe he's gone.

1239
01:33:56,923 --> 01:33:59,425
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1240
01:33:59,509 --> 01:34:02,469
Come on, buddy.
We're not out of this yet.

1241
01:34:18,570 --> 01:34:21,613
You in, kid? O.K., stay sharp.

1242
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:33,584
Here they come.

1243
01:34:51,603 --> 01:34:53,437
They're coming in too fast!

1244
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:02,946
We've lost the lateral controls!

1245
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:05,282
Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1246
01:35:06,785 --> 01:35:08,827
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1247
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:26,804
Ha ha!

1248
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,518
Got him! I got him!

1249
01:35:32,602 --> 01:35:35,020
Great, kid! Don't get cocky.

1250
01:35:36,189 --> 01:35:37,981
There's still two more of them out there!

1251
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,225
That's it! We did it!

1252
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:15,561
We did it!

1253
01:36:15,645 --> 01:36:18,147
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

1254
01:36:26,072 --> 01:36:27,489
Are they away?

1255
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:30,659
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1256
01:36:30,743 --> 01:36:35,122
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1257
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:37,916
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1258
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,751
This had better work.

1259
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:42,629
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1260
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,883
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1261
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:48,260
That doesn't sound too hard.

1262
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:49,678
They let us go.

1263
01:36:49,762 --> 01:36:52,723
It's the only explanation
for the ease of our escape.

1264
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:53,932
Easy? You call that easy?

1265
01:36:54,017 --> 01:36:55,017
They're tracking us.

1266
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:56,810
Not this ship, sister.

1267
01:36:56,895 --> 01:37:00,606
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

1268
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,316
What's so important?
What's he carrying?

1269
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,319
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1270
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:07,988
I only hope that when the data's analyzed,

1271
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:09,740
a weakness can be found.

1272
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,325
It's not over yet.

1273
01:37:11,409 --> 01:37:13,202
It is for me, sister.

1274
01:37:13,286 --> 01:37:15,037
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution,

1275
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:16,997
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1276
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,332
I expect to be well paid.

1277
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:19,625
I'm in it for the money.

1278
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:21,710
You needn't worry about your reward.

1279
01:37:21,794 --> 01:37:23,420
If money is all that you love,

1280
01:37:23,504 --> 01:37:26,006
then that's what you'll receive.

1281
01:37:28,009 --> 01:37:29,968
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1282
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:32,304
I wonder if he really
cares about anything...

1283
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:33,931
or anybody.

1284
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:35,515
I care.

1285
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,566
So...

1286
01:37:44,651 --> 01:37:46,193
what do you think of her, Han?

1287
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,153
I'm trying not to, kid.

1288
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:50,280
Good.

1289
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:56,620
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1290
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:00,165
I don't know. What do you think?

1291
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:01,792
You think a princess and a guy like me-

1292
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,627
No!

1293
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:50,841
You're safe.

1294
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,259
When we heard about Alderaan,

1295
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:53,427
we feared the worst.

1296
01:38:53,511 --> 01:38:55,345
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1297
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:58,307
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1298
01:38:58,391 --> 01:38:59,891
It's our only hope.

1299
01:39:21,622 --> 01:39:22,789
Yes.

1300
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,124
We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1301
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,460
The rebel base is on a
moon on the far side.

1302
01:39:26,544 --> 01:39:29,171
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

1303
01:39:37,597 --> 01:39:39,890
The battle station is heavily shielded

1304
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:43,810
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1305
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:48,273
Its defenses are designed
around a direct large-scale assault.

1306
01:39:48,358 --> 01:39:53,612
A small, one-man fighter should be
able to penetrate the outer defense.

1307
01:39:53,696 --> 01:39:55,989
Pardon me for asking, sir,

1308
01:39:56,074 --> 01:39:58,992
but what good are snub fighters
going to be against that?

1309
01:39:59,077 --> 01:40:03,747
The Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter to be any threat,

1310
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,625
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1311
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:13,173
An analysis of the plans provided by Princess Leia
has demonstrated a weakness in the battle station.

1312
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:16,009
The approach will not be easy.

1313
01:40:16,094 --> 01:40:22,724
You're required to maneuver straight down this
trench and skim the surface to this point.

1314
01:40:22,809 --> 01:40:25,519
The target area is only 2 meters wide.

1315
01:40:25,603 --> 01:40:30,440
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1316
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:33,693
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1317
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:38,782
A precise hit will start a chain reaction
which should destroy the station.

1318
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:42,494
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1319
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:43,912
The shaft is ray-shielded,

1320
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:45,747
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1321
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:48,333
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1322
01:40:48,418 --> 01:40:51,878
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1323
01:40:51,963 --> 01:40:54,381
They're not much bigger than 2 meters.

1324
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:57,884
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1325
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:09,062
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

1326
01:41:09,147 --> 01:41:12,858
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.

1327
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,277
This will be a day long remembered.

1328
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,821
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1329
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:22,492
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

1330
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:32,377
All flight crews, man your stations.

1331
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:37,883
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1332
01:41:37,967 --> 01:41:39,426
That's right. Yeah.

1333
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:43,513
I got some old debts
I got to pay off with this stuff.

1334
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:45,098
And even if I didn't,

1335
01:41:45,183 --> 01:41:47,893
you don't think I'd be fool enough
to stick around here, do ya?

1336
01:41:47,977 --> 01:41:49,603
Why don't you come with us?

1337
01:41:49,687 --> 01:41:51,605
You're pretty good in a fight.
We could use ya.

1338
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:54,608
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1339
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,026
You know what's about to happen,

1340
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,444
what they're up against.

1341
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:58,904
They could use a good pilot like you.

1342
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,322
You're turning your back on them.

1343
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,824
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1344
01:42:02,909 --> 01:42:05,994
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1345
01:42:06,078 --> 01:42:08,872
It's more like... suicide.

1346
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:11,166
All right.

1347
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:13,502
Take care of yourself, Han.

1348
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,254
I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

1349
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,714
Hey, Luke.

1350
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:23,386
May the Force be with you.

1351
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:29,768
Argh!

1352
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:31,186
What are you looking at?

1353
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:33,063
I know what I'm doing.

1354
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:43,031
All pilots to your stations.

1355
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:49,704
What's wrong?

1356
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:51,164
Oh, it's Han.

1357
01:42:51,249 --> 01:42:53,667
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1358
01:42:53,751 --> 01:42:55,335
He's got to follow his own path.

1359
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:57,337
No one can choose it for him.

1360
01:42:57,421 --> 01:43:01,550
I only wish Ben were here.

1361
01:43:08,849 --> 01:43:10,850
Open main launch tubes.

1362
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:13,770
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1363
01:43:13,854 --> 01:43:15,021
Hey, Luke!

1364
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:16,022
Biggs!

1365
01:43:16,107 --> 01:43:17,857
I don't believe it. How are you?

1366
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:18,942
Great.

1367
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:20,026
Hey, coming up?

1368
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:23,196
I'll be right up there with you,
and have I got stories to tell you.

1369
01:43:23,281 --> 01:43:26,616
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1370
01:43:26,701 --> 01:43:31,162
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1371
01:43:31,247 --> 01:43:32,372
You'll do all right.

1372
01:43:32,456 --> 01:43:33,873
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1373
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:36,793
I gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1374
01:43:36,877 --> 01:43:37,877
All right.

1375
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,045
Hey, Biggs.

1376
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:40,547
I told you I'd make it someday.

1377
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:43,383
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1378
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:49,431
Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a
bit beat up. You want a new one?

1379
01:43:49,515 --> 01:43:52,684
Not on your life. That little droid and I
have been through a lot together.

1380
01:43:52,768 --> 01:43:53,768
You O.K., R2?

1381
01:43:55,438 --> 01:43:56,688
Good.

1382
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:01,234
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.

1383
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:03,903
Hang on tight, R2. You've got to come back.

1384
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:08,199
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1385
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:00,794
Luke, the Force will be with you.

1386
01:45:11,222 --> 01:45:12,764
Standby alert.

1387
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:15,100
Death Star approaching.

1388
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:18,353
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.

1389
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:32,659
All wings report in.

1390
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:33,702
Red 10 standing by.

1391
01:45:33,786 --> 01:45:34,828
Red Seven standing by.

1392
01:45:34,912 --> 01:45:36,037
Red Three standing by.

1393
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:37,747
Red Six standing by.

1394
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:38,873
Red Nine standing by.

1395
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:39,958
Red Two standing by.

1396
01:45:40,042 --> 01:45:41,042
Red 11 standing by.

1397
01:45:41,127 --> 01:45:43,002
Red Five standing by.

1398
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:46,297
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1399
01:45:50,553 --> 01:45:52,554
We're passing through
the magnetic field.

1400
01:45:52,638 --> 01:45:53,513
Hold tight.

1401
01:45:53,597 --> 01:45:56,975
Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.

1402
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:01,771
Look at the size of that thing!

1403
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,856
Cut the chatter, Red Two.

1404
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,482
Accelerate to attack speed.

1405
01:46:07,862 --> 01:46:08,903
This is it, boys.

1406
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:10,613
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1407
01:46:10,698 --> 01:46:11,906
I copy, Gold Leader.

1408
01:46:11,991 --> 01:46:13,575
We're starting for the target shaft now.

1409
01:46:13,659 --> 01:46:17,120
We're in position. I'm going to cut across
the axis and try and draw their fire.

1410
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,219
Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.

1411
01:46:33,304 --> 01:46:34,846
I see it. Stay low.

1412
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:43,813
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1413
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:49,360
Luke, pull up!

1414
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:51,988
Are you all right?

1415
01:46:52,072 --> 01:46:53,364
I got a little cooked, but I'm O.K.

1416
01:46:59,288 --> 01:47:00,955
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader,

1417
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,249
but they're so small,
they're evading our turbolasers.

1418
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:05,335
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1419
01:47:05,419 --> 01:47:07,462
Get the crews to their fighters.

1420
01:47:10,049 --> 01:47:14,219
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.

1421
01:47:14,303 --> 01:47:15,261
I'm on it.

1422
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:17,430
I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.

1423
01:47:17,515 --> 01:47:18,807
I'm right with you, Red Three.

1424
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,022
I've got a problem here.

1425
01:47:27,024 --> 01:47:27,649
Eject.

1426
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:28,441
I can hold it.

1427
01:47:28,526 --> 01:47:29,108
Pull up!

1428
01:47:29,193 --> 01:47:32,320
No, I'm all... Aah!

1429
01:47:34,782 --> 01:47:38,535
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

1430
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:44,457
Luke, trust your feelings.

1431
01:47:52,216 --> 01:47:56,261
Squad leaders, we've picked up
a new group of signals.

1432
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,012
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1433
01:47:58,097 --> 01:47:59,806
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1434
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,057
Pick up your visual scanning.

1435
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,100
Here they come.

1436
01:48:05,354 --> 01:48:07,063
Watch it. You've got one on your tail.

1437
01:48:12,403 --> 01:48:13,278
I'm hit!

1438
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:15,947
You've picked one up! Watch it!

1439
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:17,282
I can't see it!

1440
01:48:19,285 --> 01:48:21,035
He's on me tight. I can't shake him!

1441
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:23,746
I'll be right there.

1442
01:48:35,885 --> 01:48:40,388
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1443
01:48:43,309 --> 01:48:45,852
Fall in! Fall in!

1444
01:48:45,936 --> 01:48:46,936
Watch your back, Luke.

1445
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,021
Watch your back.

1446
01:48:48,105 --> 01:48:49,397
Fighters above you, coming in.

1447
01:48:55,613 --> 01:48:56,821
I'm hit, but not bad.

1448
01:48:56,906 --> 01:48:58,323
R2, see what you can do with it.

1449
01:48:58,407 --> 01:49:00,617
Hang on back there.

1450
01:49:00,701 --> 01:49:03,369
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1451
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,872
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?

1452
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:07,415
I can't shake him!

1453
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:12,962
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1454
01:49:16,175 --> 01:49:17,800
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1455
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:25,934
Thanks, Wedge.

1456
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:27,685
Good shooting, Wedge.

1457
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:29,604
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1458
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:30,813
We're starting our attack run.

1459
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,026
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

1460
01:49:37,446 --> 01:49:39,739
Stay in attack formation.

1461
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,659
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1462
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:56,005
Switch all power to front deflector screen.

1463
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:01,469
How many guns do you think,
Gold Five?

1464
01:50:01,553 --> 01:50:02,720
Say about 20 guns

1465
01:50:02,805 --> 01:50:04,806
some on the surface, some on the towers.

1466
01:50:04,890 --> 01:50:07,725
Death Star will be in
range in five minutes.

1467
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:12,897
Switch to targeting computer.

1468
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:17,360
Computer locked. Getting a signal.

1469
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:21,864
The guns! They've stopped!

1470
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:24,993
Stabilize your rear deflectors.

1471
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:26,828
Watch for enemy fighters.

1472
01:50:26,912 --> 01:50:28,705
They're coming in! Three marks at 210.

1473
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,834
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1474
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:34,210
Yes, sir.

1475
01:50:48,726 --> 01:50:49,851
It's no good. I can't maneuver.

1476
01:50:49,935 --> 01:50:51,185
Stay on target.

1477
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,978
We're too close.

1478
01:50:52,062 --> 01:50:53,187
Stay on target.

1479
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,898
Loosen up!

1480
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,779
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1481
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:03,156
I copy, Gold Leader.

1482
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,240
They came from behind.

1483
01:51:08,912 --> 01:51:10,830
We've analyzed their attack, sir,

1484
01:51:10,914 --> 01:51:13,332
and there is a danger.

1485
01:51:13,417 --> 01:51:15,835
Should I have your ship standing by?

1486
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,838
Evacuate in our moment of triumph?

1487
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,715
I think you overestimate their chances.

1488
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:23,509
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

1489
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,095
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1490
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,597
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1491
01:51:27,681 --> 01:51:29,849
This is Red Two flying toward you.

1492
01:51:29,933 --> 01:51:31,851
Red Three standing by.

1493
01:51:31,935 --> 01:51:33,561
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1494
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,314
Keep half your group
out of range for the next run.

1495
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:39,025
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

1496
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:42,445
Hold up here and wait for my signal
to start your run.

1497
01:51:50,245 --> 01:51:52,121
This is it!

1498
01:51:56,668 --> 01:51:58,795
We should be able to see it by now.

1499
01:52:00,464 --> 01:52:02,256
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1500
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:06,427
There's too much interference. Red Five,
can you see them from where you are?

1501
01:52:06,512 --> 01:52:08,429
No sign of any... Wait. Coming in.35.

1502
01:52:08,514 --> 01:52:09,514
I see them.

1503
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:12,141
I'm in range.

1504
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:14,352
Target's coming up.

1505
01:52:17,731 --> 01:52:19,857
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1506
01:52:19,942 --> 01:52:22,318
Close up formation.

1507
01:52:23,654 --> 01:52:25,822
Almost there.

1508
01:52:34,915 --> 01:52:36,541
You'd better let her loose.
They're right behind me.

1509
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:38,167
Almost there.

1510
01:52:39,545 --> 01:52:41,212
I can't hold them.

1511
01:52:42,464 --> 01:52:44,173
Aah!

1512
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:50,972
It's away!

1513
01:52:54,685 --> 01:52:56,310
It's a hit!

1514
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,479
Negative, negative. It didn't go in.

1515
01:52:58,564 --> 01:53:01,232
It just impacted on the surface.

1516
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:09,365
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1517
01:53:09,449 --> 01:53:11,784
Turn to.05. We'll cover for you.

1518
01:53:11,869 --> 01:53:15,371
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1519
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:17,707
Get set up for your attack run.

1520
01:53:22,379 --> 01:53:24,088
Aah!

1521
01:53:30,512 --> 01:53:33,639
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

1522
01:53:33,724 --> 01:53:36,017
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1523
01:53:36,101 --> 01:53:39,437
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1524
01:53:39,521 --> 01:53:41,647
Right with you, boss.

1525
01:53:41,732 --> 01:53:44,025
Luke, at that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1526
01:53:44,109 --> 01:53:46,110
It'll be just like Beggars
Canyon back home.

1527
01:53:53,452 --> 01:53:55,703
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1528
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:56,787
My scope shows the tower,

1529
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:58,372
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1530
01:53:58,457 --> 01:53:59,916
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1531
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:05,421
Watch yourself. Increase
speed, full throttle.

1532
01:54:05,505 --> 01:54:06,797
What about that tower?

1533
01:54:06,882 --> 01:54:08,007
You worry about those fighters!

1534
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,258
I'll worry about the tower!

1535
01:54:14,932 --> 01:54:17,934
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose again.

1536
01:54:18,018 --> 01:54:19,310
See if you can't lock it down.

1537
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:30,279
Fighters coming in.3.

1538
01:54:38,288 --> 01:54:40,748
I'm hit! I can't stay with you!

1539
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:43,167
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1540
01:54:43,252 --> 01:54:44,293
Sorry.

1541
01:54:45,337 --> 01:54:47,296
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1542
01:54:50,259 --> 01:54:52,468
Hurry, Luke. They're coming in
much faster this time. We can't hold them.

1543
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,974
R2, try and increase the power.

1544
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,982
Hurry up, Luke!

1545
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:07,525
Quick! Quick!

1546
01:55:15,075 --> 01:55:17,618
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

1547
01:55:17,703 --> 01:55:18,828
I'm on the leader.

1548
01:55:22,291 --> 01:55:23,791
Hang on, R2.

1549
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:41,559
Use the Force, Luke.

1550
01:55:44,396 --> 01:55:46,439
Let go, Luke.

1551
01:55:48,483 --> 01:55:50,860
The Force is strong with this one.

1552
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,528
Luke, trust me.

1553
01:55:58,076 --> 01:55:59,452
His computer's off.

1554
01:55:59,536 --> 01:56:01,454
Luke, you switched off
your targeting computer!

1555
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:03,164
What's wrong?

1556
01:56:03,248 --> 01:56:04,874
Nothing. I'm all right.

1557
01:56:17,804 --> 01:56:19,055
I've lost R2!

1558
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:26,395
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1559
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,105
Rebel base in range.

1560
01:56:28,190 --> 01:56:30,733
You may fire when ready.

1561
01:56:30,817 --> 01:56:33,069
Commence primary ignition.

1562
01:56:46,249 --> 01:56:47,708
I have you now.

1563
01:56:50,128 --> 01:56:51,295
What?

1564
01:56:51,380 --> 01:56:52,254

01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:54,757
Look out!

1566
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:04,433
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1567
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:17,321
Stand by.

1568
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:31,001
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1569
01:57:31,086 --> 01:57:35,631
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

1570
01:57:53,984 --> 01:57:55,484
Luke!

1571
01:57:59,448 --> 01:58:00,865
Hey! Hey!

1572
01:58:00,949 --> 01:58:02,741
I knew you'd come back. I just knew it.

1573
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:05,453
Well, I wasn't going to let you
get all the credit and take all the reward.

1574
01:58:05,537 --> 01:58:08,247
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1575
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:09,498
Oh, no!

1576
01:58:09,583 --> 01:58:12,042
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1577
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:15,588
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1578
01:58:15,672 --> 01:58:17,506
We'll get to work on him right away.

1579
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:18,924
You must repair him.

1580
01:58:19,009 --> 01:58:21,927
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1581
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:23,220
He'll be all right.

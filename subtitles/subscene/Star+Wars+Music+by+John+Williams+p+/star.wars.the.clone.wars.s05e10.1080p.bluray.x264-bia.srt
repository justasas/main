1
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,229
Secret transmission
intercepted!

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:24,149
The Jedi Council has intercepted
an encoded transmission

3
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,317
of General Grievous.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,569
However, Republic intelligence officers

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,655
have failed to crack
the new encryption code

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,198
being used by the droids.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,953
Fears escalate that the Separatists
are about the mount a major offensive.

8
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:39,540
Having located the source of
the transmission deep in Separatist space,

9
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,794
the Jedi plan a counter-strike
to capture an enemy decoding chip

10
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,129
which will allow them
to understand the transmission

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,966
and thwart the Separatist plot.

12
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,806
Time is not on our side,
so I'll make this short.

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,059
You droids have been chosen
for a very important mission.

14
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,356
There's an encryption module
on board this Separatist dreadnought.

15
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,318
This device is scrambling
all Separatist communication in the region.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,405
We believe you five
can get behind enemy lines,

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,491
infiltrate the vault
without drawing attention to yourselves,

18
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,035
and steal that encryption module.

19
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,044
WAC-47 reporting for duty!

20
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,714
Sorry I am late, I thought the message said

21
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,551
to meet in the Jedi Storeroom,
whatever that is.

22
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,720
So? Did I miss anything?

23
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,055
Fall in line, soldier.

24
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,151
So I hear we're gonna be
taking out Separatists!

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,365
I will be honest,
some of you may not make it back.

26
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,201
What? Why is he looking at me?

27
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,702
Uh...

28
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,579
Were you just looking at me?

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,416
I was just kidding.

30
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,959
But I have faith in your abilities.

31
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,962
You are not ordinary droids.

32
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,131
You've worked with the Jedi before.

33
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:14,176
You are our secret weapons.

34
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,387
Now, let me turn you over
to your mission leader.

35
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,058
The Colonel is one of our top minds
at Strategic Command.

36
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,144
He's been with the Republic
since the Battle of Geonosis.

37
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,230
Colonel Meebur Gascon.

38
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,201
Thank you, Master Windu.
I'll take it from here.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,954
May the Force be with you.

40
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,257
Attention!

41
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,682
Now, I'm only going to say this once,
so turn up your audio inputs.

42
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,062
Once we're inside the cruiser,
we make our way to C deck.

43
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,399
That's where their
communication center is housed.

44
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,860
We bypass security here and here,

45
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,820
divert the super battle droids here,

46
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,155
then we break the vault code,
beat the swarm mines,

47
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,658
steal the encryption module,
and return home in time

48
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,244
for my promotion ceremony
to Brigadier General.

49
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,912
Are we clear?

50
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,003
Uh, uh...

51
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,464
Good! That's what I like. No questions.

52
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,008
Oh.

53
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,427
D Squad, fall in line!

54
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,607
The line starts behind me, mech.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,549
Over here, you mechs! Front and center!

56
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,886
This is Dr. Gubacher. He is...

57
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,721
Corporal?

58
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,473
Colonel.

59
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,935
Right. Well, I just want
to set the record straight.

60
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,394
I am not a mech.

61
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,482
You called us all mechs back there.
But, as you can see, I am a WAC.

62
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,734
Granted, my master's not a Jedi,

63
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,153
but I am a different class of droid.

64
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,948
Better engineering.

65
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:47,329
As I was saying
before I was rudely interrupted,

66
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,249
Dr. Gubacher is going to equip each of you

67
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:54,253
with a tactical upgrade
specially designed for this mission.

68
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,089
All right, enough with the chatter!

69
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,258
Let's get this show on the road.

70
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,096
Cyclops! You're not needed here.
Go prepare our shuttle for launch!

71
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:18,986
R2-D2, these advanced rocket boosters

72
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:22,614
should give you better aerial mobility,

73
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,242
and for longer periods of time.

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,077
Oh, but be advised,

75
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:30,831
the navigation controls are finely tuned.

76
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:36,628
QT-KT, this coil
is a remote-controlled magnet.

77
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:41,258
It can attract any metal object
in a seven-meter radius.

78
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,471
But when dealing with mines,
you'll want to take care.

79
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:50,434
The magnetic force is extremely powerful.

80
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,937
U9-C4, this laser-cutter

81
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:58,192
will slice through
most materials you encounter.

82
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,320
But make sure you're in a locked position.

83
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,451
The recoil packs quite a wallop.

84
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,291
No, no, no, no, no.

85
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:18,212
M5-BZ, we are not putting
anything inside you,

86
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,006
we're taking something out.

87
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,841
Your memory banks.

88
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:29,306
I'll be making the extraction myself
in the Salvage Room.

89
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:37,564
I am sorry, but we need to make room
for the Colonel's command center.

90
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,818
No need to baby him. He's just a droid.

91
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,532
Fortunately, he won't remember
any of this.

92
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,174
What do you want, Beezee?

93
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,051
It's me, you moron.

94
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,262
What are you doing in there, Corporal?

95
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:12,850
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's Colonel!

96
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,061
Nice setup.

97
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,064
I want to know why
I did not get an upgrade.

98
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,067
Because you are just a pilot!

99
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,196
Now do your job
and pilot this ship!

100
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,409
Just a pilot? We will see about that.

101
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,095
All right, Cyclops, listen up!

102
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,598
I want you to alert me
when we near the dreadnought.

103
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,559
I have a plan
on how to attract their attention.

104
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,604
Relax. I already took care of it.

105
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,652
What do you mean? What did you do?

106
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,948
I put us on a collision course
with the dreadnaught.

107
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,007
See, Corporal? I am not just a pilot.

108
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:30,135
You idiot! We're caught in a tractor beam!

109
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,157
Hold it right there!

110
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,326
Out of the way, tin cans!

111
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,956
Let's check the cockpit.

112
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,840
No sign of life. Just these droids.

113
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,969
Continue your search while I take
these droids in for interrogation.

114
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,189
Everyone just stay calm.

115
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,902
Oh, my gosh!

116
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,030
You are Republic droids!

117
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,908
That is right. And I am their leader!

118
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,579
Yeah! I got him!

119
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,041
Well, thanks for the assist, Qutee.

120
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,392
All right, listen up.

121
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,395
The next phase of my plan
is to reach C deck.

122
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,231
We'll take this path here.

123
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,443
Since the mechs won't draw
much attention, we'll go in a convoy.

124
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,945
Cyclops, you lead the way.

125
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,449
If anyone asks, you're taking the droids
on a repair job.

126
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:18,410
- Got it?
- Yes, sir, uh...

127
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,121
- Captain!
- It's Colonel!

128
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:25,250
I swear, Cyclops,
you are gonna drive me crazy.

129
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:34,593
Now, I want Flat Top to locate
the comm vault power supply,

130
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:39,431
then use his laser to cut the main line
and cause a temporary loss in power.

131
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,601
You can do it, Ceefor!

132
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,408
Oh. Do not forget to lock down your...

133
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:12,422
Sir. There was a temporary power loss
on C deck.

134
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,133
Has the power been re-established?

135
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,096
Yes. It was only a temporary fluctuation.

136
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:21,974
Curious.

137
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,769
All right, listen up.

138
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,982
Cutting the power put the comm vault
security system in manual override.

139
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:33,318
But someone still has to distract
some super battle droids...

140
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,988
Oh, please, please, please! Let me do it.

141
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,447
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

142
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,992
Let me do it! Please!

143
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,953
- Come on! Come on!
- All right.

144
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:44,955
You will not regret this, Corporal!

145
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,832
I am not a...

146
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,507
Halt.

147
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:00,012
I have been ordered by General Grievous
to test comm vault security,

148
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,680
and I need your help.

149
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,515
Now, follow me.

150
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:14,985
Now, I will go inside the comm vault
and send out a power surge.

151
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:17,738
I need you two to stay here.

152
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,536
It will not be safe for you
while I am working.

153
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,872
- Are we clear?
- Yes, but...

154
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,709
Good! That is what I like. No questions.

155
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,003
Huh?

156
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:37,716
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

157
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,511
Quiet!
We need to keep moving.

158
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,388
Beezee, open the comm vault
security door.

159
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:46,725
Make sure it is not booby-trapped.

160
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,073
You blockhead!
Now we're going to lose manual override!

161
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,576
You... You terminated Beezee.

162
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:08,872
It's not my fault he fried his circuitry!

163
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,751
I didn't tell that nitwit
to attack the access panel!

164
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,754
So what do we do now, Corporal?

165
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,927
Look, we can still salvage this mission.

166
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,887
If one of you could just...

167
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,973
You need to re-access that panel,

168
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:29,309
and we have to open
that comm vault door fast

169
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:33,105
and grab the encryption module
before we're caught red-handed!

170
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,442
No, I will not do it myself.

171
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,777
I'm an officer!

172
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:44,116
I've got no experience
in this type of crisis maneuver.

173
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:49,621
You fought in the Battle of Geonosis.
That did not prepare you for a crisis?

174
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,959
Well, technically I didn't
fight in that battle.

175
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,087
I'm a military analyst by trade, and...

176
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,964
You are a map reader?

177
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,970
I am an accomplished battlefield strategist!

178
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:09,141
I analyze the enemy terrain
and plot a course to victory.

179
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,143
In other words, you read maps.

180
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,146
You're off base here, Cyclops!

181
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,940
I was chosen for my fearsome cunning,

182
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:21,987
although my size
may have played a small factor.

183
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:27,618
But do not think for a moment
that Colonel Meebur Gascon

184
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,996
is going to relinquish command
of this mission.

185
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,458
I have waited a lifetime
for this opportunity,

186
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,172
and some ragtag collection of droids
is not going to deny me my destiny!

187
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,676
So, one way or another,
I will open that comm vault door!

188
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,390
Oh, there. Just like I planned it.

189
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:56,188
Now, we're going to infiltrate this vault,

190
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,234
neutralize the swarm mines,
and then secure the encryption module.

191
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,069
Any questions?

192
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,696
Have you ever been in a battle before?

193
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,536
No, I have not.
But if you'd care to see what I'm made of,

194
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,205
we can go to war right now, you and me,

195
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,708
and probably get ourselves captured
by a Separatist.

196
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,378
Or, we can execute my plan

197
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,422
and come out of this mission
looking like heroes.

198
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,050
The choice is yours, Cyclops.

199
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:32,057
First of all, my name is WAC.

200
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,602
Second of all, we will execute your plan.

201
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,897
But you have to stop
calling us stupid names,

202
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,732
Shorty.

203
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,279
Very well, WAC.

204
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,740
I'll play nice.

205
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:52,411
But only until one of you screws up again!

206
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:05,591
Sir, there has been another disturbance
on C deck.

207
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:10,429
I will investigate this situation personally.

208
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:22,608
All right, Pinky... I mean Qutee,

209
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,902
this is your chance to shine.

210
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,614
Use your magnet
to attract those swarm mines.

211
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,860
There it is.
The encryption module.

212
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:11,823
It's all up to you now, Artoo.

213
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,496
Not so fast.

214
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,290
Arms up!

215
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,840
Gravity...

216
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,843
Right! Turn it off! Quick!

217
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,399
I will help you, Corporal!

218
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:36,116
I'm gonna be sick.

219
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,119
- Corporal? Are you okay?
- Look out!

220
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,926
I will turn the gravity back on!

221
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,971
Hurry, WAC, hurry!

222
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,327
I'll take that.

223
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:21,995
Good work, Artoo!

224
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:28,001
Intruder alert. Intruder alert.

225
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:30,462
Let's move it out, D Squad!

226
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:42,850
What are you doing?
We're going to get caught!

227
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,979
Artoo says we cannot leave Beezee behind.

228
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,985
Artoo's right.
We can repair him on the shuttle.

229
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:57,489
There's trouble on C deck.

230
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,324
Report there immediately.

231
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:13,046
Get out of the way, you stupid astromechs!

232
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,681
Funny thing about droids,

233
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:25,184
last thing they'd expect to betray them,

234
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,643
another droid.

235
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,733
D Squad! Let's go home.

236
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:09,436
Ah! My first mission, a rousing success.

237
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:13,023
And a brilliant plan, if I do say so myself.

238
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:20,405
I agree, Artoo.
The team's execution was not too shabby.

239
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:26,578
Who knows, you droids
might just make decent soldiers after all.

240
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:31,542
Oh, and you, too, WAC.

241
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:32,918
Yes, sir,

242
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,628
Colonel.

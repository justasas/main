00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,120
Uh!

194
00:14:27,601 --> 00:14:28,601
Ah!

195
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,009
Wah.

196
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:38,010
Uh!

197
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,080
[fire crackling]

198
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,519

[laughing]

203
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,671
I see negotiations have gone as planned.

204
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,273
Secure this platform!

205
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,243
[rockets blasting]

206
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,311
Ugh!

207
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:31,357
Gah!

208
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:34,293
Retreat!
Retreat!

209
00:15:34,361 --> 00:15:35,328
Back inside!

210
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:38,398
[blaster deflecting]

211
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,570
[blasters firing]

212
00:15:58,753 --> 00:15:59,754
Yah!

213
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,195
[growling]

214
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,196
Uh!

215
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,833
[snarling and grunting]

216
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,102

217
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,342
[growling and straining]

218
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,746
[metallic clanging]

219
00:16:24,814 --> 00:16:26,481
Whoa!

220
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:27,549
[roars]

221
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:30,819

[straining]

225
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:53,609
Ugh!

226
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,815
[choking]

227
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,819
[grunting]

228
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:04,253
Whoa!

229
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:14,763
Come on, let's get out of here.

230
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:15,831
[barking]

231
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,467
Ahh.

232
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:20,635
Let them go.

233
00:17:20,703 --> 00:17:24,405
They're only bounty hunters;
they have no allegiance.

234
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:35,115
Sir, the Hutts have escaped.

235
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:37,150
Except one.

236
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:42,121
Where are the others?

237
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,224
<i>Hopa!</i>

238
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,459
<i>Hopa!</i>

239
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:49,696
Kill him.

240
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,632
[wailing]

241
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,300
<i>Hagwa.
Hagwa.</i>

242
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:56,303
<i>Hagwa.</i>

243
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,838
Give me a location.

244
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:00,107
Tatooine.

245
00:18:00,174 --> 00:18:01,508
Tatooine.

246
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:04,911
Jabba's palace.

247
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,947
So the only thing that you can tell me

248
00:18:07,015 --> 00:18:11,352
is that I will find Jabba
at Jabba's palace?

249
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:14,856
[growls]

250
00:18:14,923 --> 00:18:16,557

251
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:17,625
[lightsaber crackling]

252
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,491
[blasters firing]

253
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,193
[rumbling]

254
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:14,016
[distant blaster fire]

255
00:19:14,084 --> 00:19:15,452
[snorting]

256
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:20,557
[squealing]

257
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:35,005
<i>Do dee chabwon geesa bonkee bolla.</i>

258
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,841
Give up, Jabba.
You're the only ones left.

259
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,979
Submit or suffer.

260
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,316
[chortling]

261
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:50,955
<i>Weeteebah fa foonta granee, meendeeya.</i>

262
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,457
The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families

263
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,326
have decided to join you.

264
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,410
Between the Hutts, Black Sun,
and the Pykes,

265
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:15,480
we'll have a large reserve
of muscle and supplies.

266
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,248
Yes.

267
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,385
Then Mandalore and Kenobi
are still our priority?

268
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,387
They are vital.

269
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,557
I'm curious to hear the rest
of your plan.

270
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,859
The vision has expanded.

271
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,830
You will still rule Mandalore,
and under your protection,

272
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:35,834
I will command
a new galactic underworld.

273
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:44,043
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

274
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,613
It gives you a great deal
of options for your enterprise.

275
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,983
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

276
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:52,785
With their combined forces,

277
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:56,522
the Republic and the Separatists
will be irrelevant.

278
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,990
Then are we ready?

279
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,226
Mobilize the army.

280
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,561
Send an advanced guard to the capital.

281
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:06,466
I want a list of targets
vital to Mandalore's security.

282
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,567
Choose wisely.

283
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:11,404
There will be no second chances.

284
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:23,717
Stay focused.

285
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:26,821
Mandalore will soon be ours,
and Maul and his brother

286
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:29,958
will be dead alongside the duchess.

Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

87
00:03:12,524 --> 00:03:14,859
the one crawling with vulture droids.

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,860
I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

89
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,705
- <i>Oddball, do you copy?</i>
- <i>Copy Red Leader.</i>

90
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,082
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,084
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

Set S-foils in attack position.

This is where the fun begins.

94
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:55,062
Let them pass between us.

95
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,082
They're all over me.

00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,210

- I'm gonna go help them out.

00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:19,211
<i>No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.</i>

98
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:35,564
Missiles. Pull up.

99
00:04:35,565 --> 00:04:40,565
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

100
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:49,157
All right, R4. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

101
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:56,206
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

102
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:08,426
We got 'em, R2.

103
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:19,646
Flying is for droids.

104
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:26,532
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- <i>lsee</i> them.

105
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:31,533
Buzz droids.

106
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,500
R4, be careful. You have a-

107
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:44,508
Oh, dear.

108
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:46,427
They're shutting down all the controls.

109
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:48,679
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,973
<i>The mission. Get to the command ship.</i>

111
00:05:50,974 --> 00:05:55,974
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

112
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:02,902
In the name of-

113
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:07,903
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

114
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:18,288
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

115
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:24,336
They're all over me. Anakin!

116
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:29,925
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

117
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:32,514
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

118
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:37,515
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

119
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:48,572
Get him, R2.

120
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:53,573
Watch out.

121
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:59,579
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

122
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,759
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

123
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,763
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

124
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,932
Have you noticed the shields are still up?

125
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:19,933
Sorry, Master.

126
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:29,484
I have a bad feeling about this.

127
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:46,418
There they are. Get them.

128
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,639
R2, locate the chancellor.

129
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:08,277
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-

130
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:11,447
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

131
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,490
I sense Count Dooku.

132
00:08:13,491 --> 00:08:16,869
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

133
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,415
Spring the trap.

134
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,834
R2, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

135
00:08:23,835 --> 00:08:28,835
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

136
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,645
What's the situation, Captain?

137
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:47,691
Twojedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

138
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:52,692
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

139
00:08:56,076 --> 00:09:01,076
Destroyers.

140
00:09:05,418 --> 00:09:08,379
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

141
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,380
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

142
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:23,807
Those arejedi fighters all right.

143
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,440
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

144
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:31,485
There's more than one way out of here.

145
00:09:31,486 --> 00:09:33,821
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

146
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:38,534
R2, activate elevator 31174.

147
00:09:38,535 --> 00:09:40,828
- <i>Come</i> in, R2.
- What that?

148
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,830
<i>R2, do you cow'?</i>

149
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:47,167
<i>R2, activate the elevator number 31174.</i>

150
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:50,212
Get back to work. That nothin'.

151
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:53,257
<i>Activate the elevator 31174.</i>

152
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:58,258
R2-

153
00:10:00,974 --> 00:10:02,975
Always on the move.

154
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:07,104
<i>R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?</i>

155
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:11,024
<i>R2?</i>

156
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:16,025
R2! R2!

157
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:22,282
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

158
00:10:22,412 --> 00:10:24,413
Hands up,jedi.

159
00:10:24,414 --> 00:10:26,707
<i>R2, do you cow'?</i>

160
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:31,708
<i>R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.</i>

161
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,550
Hey, you!

162
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,850
That's better.

163
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:49,851
You stupid little astro droid.

164
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:02,242
Oh, it's you.

165
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:04,161
My EYES! My eyes!

166
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:07,623
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-

167
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,750
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

168
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:14,751
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

169
00:11:49,332 --> 00:11:51,333
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

170
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:56,334
Count Dooku.

171
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:02,549
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

172
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:14,356
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

173
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:18,819
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

174
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,821
Your swords, please.

175
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:24,408
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

176
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:29,409
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

177
00:12:37,463 --> 00:12:39,673
I've been looking forward to this.

178
00:12:39,674 --> 00:12:42,968
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

179
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:47,969
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

180
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:11,534
Get-

181
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,769
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

182
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,693
You have hate. You have anger.

183
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:46,694
But you don't use them.

184
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:07,886
Good, Anakin. Good.

185
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:10,639
Kill him.

186
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Kill him now.

187
00:14:18,272 --> 00:14:22,609
I shouldn't.

188
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:27,610
Do it.

189
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:39,418
You did well, Anakin.

190
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,796
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

191
00:14:42,797 --> 00:14:45,298
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

192
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,010
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not thejedi way.

193
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:53,515
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

194
00:14:53,516 --> 00:14:56,643
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

195
00:14:56,644 --> 00:15:01,644
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

196
00:15:03,192 --> 00:15:08,192
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

197
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:14,286
Anakin, there's no time.

198
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:18,373
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

199
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:21,752
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

200
00:15:21,753 --> 00:15:26,753
His fate will be the same as ours.

201
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:33,346
Prepare for attack!

202
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:38,347
All batteries, fire! Fire!

203
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,318
Elevator's not working.

204
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,990
R2, activate elevator 3224.

205
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:17,345
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

206
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:39,867
Magnetize! Magnetize!

207
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:48,584
Fire the emergency booster engines.

208
00:16:51,926 --> 00:16:56,926
We're leveling out, sir.

209
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,862
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

210
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,573
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

211
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,867
- What is that?
- Oops.

212
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:18,952
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

213
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:23,953
Too late. Jump!

214
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,263
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

215
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:41,099
R2, get down here.

216
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,100
<i>R2, do you cow'?</i>

217
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,568
General, we found thejedi.
They're in hallway 328.

218
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:56,569
Activate ray shields.

219
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:58,283
Ray shields.

220
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:01,286
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

221
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:04,623
Apparently not.

222
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:08,668
- I say patience.
- Patience?

223
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:11,296
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments...

224
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:16,297
and then he'll release the ray shields.

225
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:25,769
See? No problem.

226
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:30,732
Don't move.

227
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:35,733
Do you have a plan B?

228
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:41,743
Ah, yes.

229
00:18:41,744 --> 00:18:43,954
The negotiator.

230
00:18:43,955 --> 00:18:48,291
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

231
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:49,584
Excuse me.

232
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:54,089
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

233
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,299
And-

234
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,843
Anakin Skywalker.

235
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:03,844
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

236
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:12,061
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

237
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:15,026
Jedi scum.

238
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:20,027
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

239
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:27,618
Your Iightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

240
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,835
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

241
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:36,836
R2.

242
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:40,635
Crush them!

243
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:45,636
Make them suffer!

244
00:19:46,726 --> 00:19:48,518
Come. Now!

245
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:53,519
Stay at your stations!

246
00:19:57,361 --> 00:20:02,361
Get him! Get him!

247
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:23,678
Run!

248
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,680
Don't bother with them.

249
00:20:25,681 --> 00:20:30,681
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:43,235
You lose, General Kenobi.

251
00:21:04,762 --> 00:21:09,762
Get out of here! Run!

252
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:24,985
Time to abandon ship.

253
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:32,205
All the escape pods have been launched.

254
00:21:32,206 --> 00:21:35,375
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

255
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,211
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

256
00:21:38,212 --> 00:21:42,173
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

257
00:21:42,174 --> 00:21:45,135
Strap yourselves in.

258
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:50,136
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

259
00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:06,990
We lost something.

260
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:11,991
Not to worry. We are still ﬂying halfa ship.

261
00:22:15,124 --> 00:22:20,124
Now we're really picking up speed.

262
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:28,094
Eight plus 60.

263
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:33,095
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

264
00:22:44,486 --> 00:22:48,990
Steady.

265
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:53,536
Easy, R2.

266
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:55,288
5000.

267
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:57,332
Fire ships on the left and the right.

268
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:02,333
- We'll take you in.
- Copythat

269
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:07,463
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

270
00:23:37,706 --> 00:23:42,706
Another happy landing.

271
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,990
Corning, Master?

272
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:15,618
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

273
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:18,162
Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

274
00:24:18,163 --> 00:24:22,125
Hold on. This whole operation was your idea.

275
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:25,378
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

276
00:24:25,379 --> 00:24:27,880
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

277
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:30,550
carrying me unconscious on your back.

278
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:32,510
All because of your training.

279
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:36,139
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

280
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,642
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

281
00:24:39,643 --> 00:24:43,479
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

282
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,481
Ninth time.

283
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:50,482
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

284
00:24:55,075 --> 00:24:57,702
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

285
00:24:57,703 --> 00:25:00,705
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

286
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:05,501
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

287
00:25:05,502 --> 00:25:09,130
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

288
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:13,551
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

289
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:15,553
And I assure you...

290
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:19,390
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

291
00:25:19,391 --> 00:25:24,391
Then thejedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

292
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,939
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

293
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,026
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

294
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:33,196
Thank you, Senator Organa.

295
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:36,574
It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

296
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:38,576
Now there I agree with you.

297
00:25:38,577 --> 00:25:41,412
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

298
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:46,413
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

299
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:50,088
I will do everything I can in the senate.

300
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:55,089
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

301
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:06,938
Oh, Anakin.

302
00:26:06,939 --> 00:26:10,024
I've missed you, Padmé.

303
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:13,361
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

304
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:16,447
I'm all right.

305
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,117
It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime.

306
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:22,036
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

307
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:25,498
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

308
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,251
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

309
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:31,838
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

310
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,839
Anakin, don't say things like that.

311
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:46,644
Are you all right? You're trembling.

312
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:50,857
What's going on?

313
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:54,944
Something wonderful has happened.

314
00:26:54,945 --> 00:26:59,945
Ani, I'm pregnant.

315
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:07,327
That's-

316
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:14,505
That's wonderful.

317
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,925
What are we gonna do?

318
00:27:17,926 --> 00:27:22,305
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

319
00:27:22,306 --> 00:27:26,100
This is a happy moment.

320
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:31,101
The happiest moment of my life.

321
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:37,505
Yes, Lord Sidious?

322
00:28:37,506 --> 00:28:39,507
<i>General Grievous...</i>

323
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:44,508
<i>I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.</i>

324
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:48,683
It will be done, my lord.

325
00:28:48,684 --> 00:28:53,684
<i>The end of the war is near, General.</i>

326
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,774
But the loss of Count Dooku-

327
00:28:56,775 --> 00:29:01,696
<i>His death was a necessary loss.</i>

328
00:29:01,697 --> 00:29:05,449
<i>Soon I will have a new apprentice-</i>

329
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,450
<i>one far younger and more powerful.</i>

330
00:29:37,733 --> 00:29:40,860
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

331
00:29:40,861 --> 00:29:44,322
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

332
00:29:44,323 --> 00:29:47,450
where we can be safe.

333
00:29:47,451 --> 00:29:52,451
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

334
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:58,624
I know the perfect spot. Right by the gardens.

335
00:30:02,341 --> 00:30:07,261
You are so... beautiful.

336
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:11,932
It's only because I'm so in love.

337
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:16,145
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

338
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:20,566
So love has blinded you?

339
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:24,195
That's not exactly what I meant.

340
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:29,196
But it's probably true.

341
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:40,874
Anakin, help me!

342
00:31:40,605 --> 00:31:45,605
What's bothering you?

343
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,196
Nothing.

344
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:52,158
I remember when I gave this to you.

345
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,159
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

346
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:02,376
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

347
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:06,922
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother,just before she died.

348
00:32:06,923 --> 00:32:11,677
And?

349
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:16,265
And it was about you.

350
00:32:16,266 --> 00:32:19,894
Tell me.

351
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:24,895
It was only a dream.

352
00:32:34,743 --> 00:32:37,536
You die in childbirth.

353
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:40,331
And the baby?

354
00:32:40,332 --> 00:32:44,168
I don't know.

355
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:49,169
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

356
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:52,426
This baby will change our lives.

357
00:32:52,427 --> 00:32:55,513
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

358
00:32:55,514 --> 00:32:58,015
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

359
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:01,310
I know. I know.

360
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:06,311
Do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

361
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:10,152
We don't need his help.

362
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:15,153
Our baby is a blessing.

363
00:33:28,922 --> 00:33:30,506
Premonitions?

364
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:33,175
Premonitions.

365
00:33:33,176 --> 00:33:37,096
These visions you have-

366
00:33:37,097 --> 00:33:42,097
They're of pain, suffering.

367
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,978
Death.

368
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:48,979
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

369
00:33:50,318 --> 00:33:51,986
Someone.

370
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:55,072
Close to you?

371
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,408
Yes.

372
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:01,370
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

373
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:06,371
The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

374
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,297
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

375
00:34:11,298 --> 00:34:14,592
Death is a natural part of life.

376
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:19,388
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

377
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,766
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

378
00:34:22,767 --> 00:34:25,978
Attachment leads to jealousy.

379
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:29,523
The shadow of greed that is.

380
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:32,443
What must I do, Master Yoda?

381
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:35,613
Train yourself to let <i>go...</i>

382
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:40,614
of everything you fear to lose.

383
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,631
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

384
00:34:53,632 --> 00:34:56,133
I'm sorry. I was held up.

385
00:34:56,134 --> 00:35:00,137
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

386
00:35:00,138 --> 00:35:05,138
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to B02 Pity.

387
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:08,812
What's wrong, then?

388
00:35:08,813 --> 00:35:13,734
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

389
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:18,197
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

390
00:35:18,198 --> 00:35:22,368
It'll make it easier for us to end this war.

391
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:26,330
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

392
00:35:26,331 --> 00:35:28,332
Be careful of what?

393
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,085
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

394
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:33,379
He would not say.

395
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,049
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

396
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,385
All of this is unusual.

397
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:44,386
And it's making me feel uneasy.

398
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,738
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

399
00:35:59,739 --> 00:36:02,116
Of course.

400
00:36:02,117 --> 00:36:05,160
I need your help, son.

401
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:07,955
What do you mean?

402
00:36:07,956 --> 00:36:10,541
I'm depending on you.

403
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,584
For what? I don't understand.

404
00:36:12,585 --> 00:36:17,585
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

405
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:24,763
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on thejedi Council.

406
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,807
Me?

407
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:29,643
A master?

408
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:33,439
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

409
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,650
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

410
00:36:36,651 --> 00:36:41,071
I think they will. They need you.

411
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:46,072
More than you know.

412
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:58,255
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

413
00:36:58,256 --> 00:37:02,885
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

414
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:04,553
I understand.

415
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:07,014
You are on this council...

416
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:10,684
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

417
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:15,685
What?

418
00:37:17,317 --> 00:37:20,319
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

419
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,864
It's unfair.

420
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:27,868
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

421
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,869
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

422
00:37:33,792 --> 00:37:38,792
Forgive me, Master.

423
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,174
<i>We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...</i>

424
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:46,011
<i>but have found no sign of General Grievous.</i>

425
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:48,889
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

426
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,101
The outlying systems you must sweep.

427
00:37:52,102 --> 00:37:54,436
We do not have many ships to spare.

428
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:57,689
<i>What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?</i>

429
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,526
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

430
00:38:00,527 --> 00:38:05,280
He's right. it's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

431
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:07,491
Go I will.

432
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:10,619
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

433
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,329
It's settled then.

434
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:17,330
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

435
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,755
May the Force be with us all.

436
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:24,508
What kind of nonsense is this?

437
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:27,010
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

438
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:29,888
It's never been done in the history
of thejedi. it's insulting.

439
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,850
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

440
00:38:32,851 --> 00:38:36,979
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

441
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,482
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

442
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:44,361
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

443
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:47,865
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

444
00:38:47,866 --> 00:38:50,200
But it's what you wanted.

445
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:53,620
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

446
00:38:53,621 --> 00:38:55,622
That has nothing to do with this.

447
00:38:55,623 --> 00:38:58,667
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

448
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,753
is because the chancellor trusts you.

449
00:39:01,754 --> 00:39:03,714
And?

450
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:07,009
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

451
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:12,010
What situation?

452
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:16,727
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

453
00:39:16,728 --> 00:39:21,728
They want to know what he's up to.

454
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,528
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

455
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:31,241
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

456
00:39:31,242 --> 00:39:34,286
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

457
00:39:34,287 --> 00:39:37,831
This assignment is not to be on record.

458
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:40,876
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

459
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:44,004
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

460
00:39:44,005 --> 00:39:46,215
That is why you must help us.

461
00:39:46,216 --> 00:39:49,801
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

462
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:53,597
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

463
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:55,682
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

464
00:39:55,683 --> 00:40:00,229
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

465
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,107
You're asking me to do something
against thejedi code.

466
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:07,277
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

467
00:40:07,278 --> 00:40:12,278
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

468
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:18,576
The council is asking you.

469
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:27,297
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

470
00:40:27,298 --> 00:40:30,592
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

471
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:33,011
I don't think the boy can handle it.

472
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:35,639
I don't trust him.

473
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,601
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

474
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:44,064
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

475
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,358
So the prophecy says.

476
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:51,359
A prophecy that misread could have been.

477
00:40:53,074 --> 00:40:55,075
He will not let me down.

478
00:40:55,076 --> 00:40:57,119
He never has.

479
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I hope right you are.

480
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:28,942
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to thejedi order.

481
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:33,864
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

482
00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:37,159
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

483
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,746
What do you mean?

484
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:44,458
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

485
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:48,879
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

486
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,880
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

487
00:41:54,385 --> 00:41:57,429
This war represents a failure to listen.

488
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,556
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

489
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:02,934
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

490
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:07,064
Don't ask me to do that.

491
00:42:07,065 --> 00:42:11,568
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

492
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,946
- What is it?
- Nothing.

493
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:19,947
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

494
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:23,163
Hold me.

495
00:42:23,164 --> 00:42:26,583
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

496
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:30,462
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

497
00:42:30,463 --> 00:42:35,463
No politics, no plotting, no war.

498
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,924
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

499
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:19,594
Come closer. I have good news.

500
00:43:19,595 --> 00:43:21,596
Our clone intelligence units...

501
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:24,766
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

502
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:27,477
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

503
00:43:27,478 --> 00:43:30,063
At last.

504
00:43:30,064 --> 00:43:33,358
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

505
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,820
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

506
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,322
if it didn't select you for this assignment.

507
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:44,323
You're the best choice, by far.

508
00:43:45,705 --> 00:43:47,289
Sit down.

509
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:52,290
Leave us.

510
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:08,055
You know I'm not able
to rely on thejedi Council.

511
00:44:09,312 --> 00:44:13,607
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

512
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:15,817
I'm not sure I understand.

513
00:44:15,818 --> 00:44:19,613
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

514
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:24,367
Thejedi Council want control of the Republic.

515
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:26,995
They're planning to betray me.

516
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:30,582
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

517
00:44:30,583 --> 00:44:34,711
Search your feelings.

518
00:44:34,712 --> 00:44:39,712
You know, don't you?

519
00:44:41,677 --> 00:44:43,678
I know they don't trust you.

520
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,098
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

521
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,477
Or democracy, for that matter.

522
00:44:50,478 --> 00:44:54,940
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

523
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:58,610
Why?

524
00:44:58,611 --> 00:45:03,611
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

525
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:10,910
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

526
00:45:13,251 --> 00:45:15,919
I don't-

527
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,921
I don't know what to say.

528
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:22,092
Remember back to your early teachings.

529
00:45:22,093 --> 00:45:26,012
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

530
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:30,767
- Even thejedi.
- Thejedi use their power for good.

531
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:33,019
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

532
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:38,020
The Sith and thejedi
are similar in almost every way...

533
00:45:40,236 --> 00:45:44,531
including their quest for greater power.

534
00:45:44,532 --> 00:45:47,659
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

535
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,621
They think inwards- only about themselves.

536
00:45:51,622 --> 00:45:54,749
And thejedi don't?

537
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,750
Thejedi are selﬂess.
They only care about others.

538
00:46:08,723 --> 00:46:13,723
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

539
00:46:18,816 --> 00:46:23,816
I thought not. it's not a story
thejedi would tell you.

540
00:46:24,322 --> 00:46:27,240
It's a Sith legend.

541
00:46:27,241 --> 00:46:31,536
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith...

542
00:46:31,537 --> 00:46:34,539
so powerful and so wise...

543
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,502
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

544
00:46:39,503 --> 00:46:44,341
to create... life.

545
00:46:44,342 --> 00:46:47,510
He had such a knowledge of the dark side...

546
00:46:47,511 --> 00:46:52,511
he could even keep the ones he cared about...

547
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,100
from dying.

548
00:46:58,856 --> 00:47:03,526
He could actually... save people from death?

549
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:08,156
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

550
00:47:08,157 --> 00:47:13,157
some consider to be unnatural.

551
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:16,373
What happened to him?

552
00:47:16,374 --> 00:47:19,793
He became so powerful...

553
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:23,088
the only thing he was afraid of was...

554
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:25,090
losing his power.

555
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:28,426
Which eventually, of course, he did.

556
00:47:28,427 --> 00:47:33,427
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

557
00:47:34,392 --> 00:47:39,392
Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.

558
00:47:40,231 --> 00:47:42,107
It's ironic.

559
00:47:42,108 --> 00:47:45,360
He could save others from death...

560
00:47:45,361 --> 00:47:50,361
but not himself.

561
00:47:51,617 --> 00:47:56,617
Is it possible to learn this power?

562
00:47:57,998 --> 00:48:02,998
Not from ajedi.

563
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:22,017
<i>All Red units, over here!</i>

564
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:33,908
<i>Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?</i>

565
00:48:33,909 --> 00:48:35,910
<i>A partial message was intercepted...</i>

566
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:40,911
<i>in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.</i>

567
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:44,294
<i>Act on this we must.</i>

568
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:49,007
<i>The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.</i>

569
00:48:49,008 --> 00:48:52,719
<i>Quickly and decisively we should proceed.</i>

570
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,720
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

571
00:48:57,725 --> 00:49:00,477
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

572
00:49:00,478 --> 00:49:02,562
not the chancellor.

573
00:49:02,563 --> 00:49:07,563
<i>A master is needed, with more experience.</i>

574
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:12,197
<i>I concur. Master Kenobi should go.</i>

575
00:49:12,198 --> 00:49:13,740
<i>I agree.</i>

576
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:14,991
<i>Aye.</i>

577
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,659
Aye.

578
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,660
<i>Very well. Council adjourned.</i>

579
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:30,006
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

580
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:35,007
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

581
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:52,441
Charge!

582
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:09,041
<i>Head for cover!</i>

583
00:50:21,392 --> 00:50:24,394
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

584
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:27,355
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

585
00:50:27,356 --> 00:50:30,400
Master.

586
00:50:30,401 --> 00:50:35,401
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

587
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:40,368
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

588
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:45,369
L'vejust been so frustrated with the council.

589
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:49,878
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

590
00:50:49,879 --> 00:50:52,589
I have trained you since you were a small boy.

591
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,799
I have taught you everything I know.

592
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,429
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

593
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,223
But be patient, Anakin.

594
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:07,224
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

595
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:16,154
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

596
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:21,155
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

597
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:46,309
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

598
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:48,061
On the far side.

599
00:51:48,062 --> 00:51:50,480
I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

600
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:55,318
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

601
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:00,319
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

602
00:52:25,891 --> 00:52:28,351
Save your energy.

603
00:52:28,352 --> 00:52:30,228
I can%.

604
00:52:30,229 --> 00:52:35,229
Don't give up, Padmé.

605
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:48,037
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

606
00:52:48,038 --> 00:52:51,499
He came by this morning.

607
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,501
What did he want?

608
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:57,922
He's worried about you.

609
00:52:57,923 --> 00:53:02,923
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

610
00:53:03,053 --> 00:53:05,888
I feel lost.

611
00:53:05,889 --> 00:53:10,889
Lost? What do you mean?

612
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:14,397
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

613
00:53:14,398 --> 00:53:18,568
They trust you with their lives.

614
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:21,195
Somethings happening.

615
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:25,742
I'm not thejedi I should be.

616
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:28,911
I want more.

617
00:53:28,912 --> 00:53:32,915
And I know I shouldn't.

618
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:37,916
You expect too much of yourself.

619
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:42,175
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

620
00:53:42,176 --> 00:53:44,218
From my nightmares.

621
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:47,180
Is that what's bothering you?

622
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,932
I won't lose you, Padmé.

623
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:52,143
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

624
00:53:52,144 --> 00:53:57,144
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

625
00:54:38,524 --> 00:54:41,025
Greetings, youngjedi.

626
00:54:41,026 --> 00:54:44,570
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

627
00:54:44,571 --> 00:54:47,281
Unfortunately, the war.

628
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:51,285
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

629
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:54,580
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

630
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:59,581
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

631
00:55:08,512 --> 00:55:11,889
He is here. We are being held hostage.

632
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,892
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

633
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:19,814
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

634
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:22,358
Tell your people to take shelter.

635
00:55:22,359 --> 00:55:27,359
If you have warriors, now is the time.

636
00:55:36,248 --> 00:55:41,248
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

637
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:47,421
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

638
00:56:28,842 --> 00:56:33,842
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

639
00:56:36,683 --> 00:56:41,683
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

640
00:56:49,404 --> 00:56:51,822
It is a volcanic planet.

641
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:55,952
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

642
00:56:55,953 --> 00:56:59,330
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

643
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:04,331
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

644
00:57:04,670 --> 00:57:09,670
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

645
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:18,303
Your ship is waiting.

646
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:37,743
Hello there.

647
00:57:37,744 --> 00:57:42,415
General Kenobi.

648
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:47,003
You are a bold one.

649
00:57:47,004 --> 00:57:52,004
Kill him.

650
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:05,855
Back away.

651
00:58:05,856 --> 00:58:10,568
I will deal with thisjedi slime myself.

652
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,862
Your move.

653
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,697
You fool.

654
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:19,698
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

655
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:32,044
Attack, Kenobi.

656
00:59:27,229 --> 00:59:29,271
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

657
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:31,273
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

658
00:59:31,274 --> 00:59:36,274
Cover yourself. Come on.

659
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:43,077
Move it! Move it!

660
00:59:43,078 --> 00:59:45,871
Come on, move! Come on, everybody!

661
00:59:45,872 --> 00:59:48,290
Army or not...

662
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:53,291
you must realize you are doomed.

663
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:58,505
I don't think so.

664
01:00:53,899 --> 01:00:58,899
<i>Cover that corner.</i>

665
01:01:01,698 --> 01:01:03,866
<i>Master Windu, may I interrupt?</i>

666
01:01:03,867 --> 01:01:06,744
<i>General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...</i>

667
01:01:06,745 --> 01:01:09,121
<i>and we have begun our attack.</i>

668
01:01:09,122 --> 01:01:10,956
Thank you, Commander.

669
01:01:10,957 --> 01:01:15,169
Anakin, deliver this report to the chancellor.

670
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,546
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

671
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:22,547
Yes, Master.

672
01:01:26,473 --> 01:01:29,850
I sense a plot to destroy thejedi.

673
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:33,020
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

674
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:35,356
<i>If he does not give up his emergency powers...</i>

675
01:01:35,357 --> 01:01:37,358
<i>after the destruction of Grievous...</i>

676
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:41,070
<i>then he should be removed from office.</i>

677
01:01:41,071 --> 01:01:43,697
Thejedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

678
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:45,699
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

679
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:50,700
<i>To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.</i>

680
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:57,415
<i>Great care we must take.</i>

681
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:04,218
Chancellor.

682
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:06,845
We'vejust received a report
from Master Kenobi.

683
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:09,598
He has engaged General Grievous.

684
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,599
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

685
01:02:14,813 --> 01:02:16,897
I should be there with him.

686
01:02:16,898 --> 01:02:19,358
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

687
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:22,736
doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents.

688
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:27,737
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

689
01:02:28,535 --> 01:02:31,829
I wish I knew.

690
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,456
More and more I get the feeling that...

691
01:02:34,457 --> 01:02:39,457
I'm being excluded from the council.

692
01:02:43,675 --> 01:02:48,675
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

693
01:02:49,848 --> 01:02:53,017
They don't trust you, Anakin.

694
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:55,144
They see your future.

695
01:02:55,145 --> 01:03:00,145
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

696
01:03:00,191 --> 01:03:05,191
You must break through the fog of lies
thejedi have created around you.

697
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:12,161
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

698
01:03:12,162 --> 01:03:15,331
How do you know the ways of the Force?

699
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:19,168
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

700
01:03:19,169 --> 01:03:24,131
Even the nature of the dark side.

701
01:03:24,132 --> 01:03:29,094
You know the dark side?

702
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:32,514
If one is to understand the great mystery...

703
01:03:32,515 --> 01:03:35,017
one must study all its aspects...

704
01:03:35,018 --> 01:03:38,896
not just the dogmatic narrow view of thejedi.

705
01:03:38,897 --> 01:03:42,149
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

706
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:46,570
you must embrace a larger view of the Force.

707
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:49,615
Be careful of thejedi, Anakin.

708
01:03:49,616 --> 01:03:54,616
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than anyjedi.

709
01:03:55,538 --> 01:03:58,290
Learn to know the dark side of the Force...

710
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:02,044
and you will be able to save your wife...

711
01:04:02,045 --> 01:04:05,214
from certain death.

712
01:04:05,215 --> 01:04:07,216
What did you say?

713
01:04:07,217 --> 01:04:12,217
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

714
01:04:12,555 --> 01:04:14,848
You're the Sith lord.

715
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:19,687
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

716
01:04:19,688 --> 01:04:24,688
Don't continue to be a pawn
of thejedi Council.

717
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:29,071
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

718
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:31,740
greater than that of an ordinaryjedi.

719
01:04:31,741 --> 01:04:34,243
A life of significance...

720
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:39,244
of conscience.

721
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:45,750
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

722
01:04:46,089 --> 01:04:48,590
I know you would.

723
01:04:48,591 --> 01:04:52,511
I can feel your anger.

724
01:04:52,512 --> 01:04:55,305
It gives you focus...

725
01:04:55,306 --> 01:05:00,306
makes you stronger.

726
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:06,400
I'm going to turn you over
to thejedi Council.

727
01:05:06,401 --> 01:05:08,152
Of course. You should.

728
01:05:08,153 --> 01:05:11,280
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

729
01:05:11,281 --> 01:05:14,950
I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

730
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:17,453
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

731
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:21,206
Know the power of the dark side.

732
01:05:21,207 --> 01:05:26,207
Power to save Padmé.

733
01:07:32,505 --> 01:07:37,505
So uncivilized.

734
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:43,307
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

735
01:07:43,308 --> 01:07:47,227
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

736
01:07:47,228 --> 01:07:49,229
We're on our way to make sure...

737
01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:51,607
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

738
01:07:51,608 --> 01:07:55,360
He won't give up his power.
I'vejust learned a terrible truth.

739
01:07:55,361 --> 01:07:58,947
I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith lord.

740
01:07:58,948 --> 01:08:00,616
A Sith lord?

741
01:08:00,617 --> 01:08:03,577
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

742
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:07,623
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

743
01:08:07,624 --> 01:08:09,875
He's been trained to use the dark side.

744
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:14,129
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

745
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:16,465
Then our worst fears have been realized.

746
01:08:16,466 --> 01:08:20,052
We must move quickly
if thejedi order is to survive.

747
01:08:20,053 --> 01:08:22,596
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

748
01:08:22,597 --> 01:08:24,973
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

749
01:08:24,974 --> 01:08:28,018
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

750
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:30,896
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

751
01:08:30,897 --> 01:08:33,148
There is much fear that clouds yourjudgment.

752
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:37,319
- I must go, Master.
- No.

753
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:41,406
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

754
01:08:41,407 --> 01:08:45,160
But for now, remain here.

755
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:50,161
Wait in the council chambers until we return.

756
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:55,249
Yes, Master.

757
01:09:21,614 --> 01:09:23,991
<i>You do know, don't you...</i>

758
01:09:23,992 --> 01:09:26,451
<i>if the jedi destroy me...</i>

759
01:09:26,452 --> 01:09:31,452
<i>any chance of saving her will be lost.</i>

760
01:10:59,337 --> 01:11:04,337
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

761
01:11:04,717 --> 01:11:07,260
I must say you're here sooner than expected.

762
01:11:07,261 --> 01:11:10,972
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

763
01:11:10,973 --> 01:11:13,016
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

764
01:11:13,017 --> 01:11:15,727
Are you threatening me, Masterjedi?

765
01:11:15,728 --> 01:11:17,771
The senate will decide your fate.

766
01:11:17,772 --> 01:11:22,772
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

767
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:31,948
It's treason then.

768
01:13:08,257 --> 01:13:12,928
You are under arrest, my lord.

769
01:13:12,929 --> 01:13:17,349
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

770
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,601
Thejedi are taking over.

771
01:13:19,602 --> 01:13:22,187
The oppression of the Sith will never return.

772
01:13:22,188 --> 01:13:27,188
You have lost.

773
01:13:28,277 --> 01:13:32,948
You will die!

774
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:34,950
He's a traitor!

775
01:13:34,951 --> 01:13:39,951
He is the traitor!

776
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:45,289
I have the power to save the one you love.

777
01:13:45,461 --> 01:13:48,463
You must choose.

778
01:13:48,464 --> 01:13:52,133
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

779
01:13:52,134 --> 01:13:57,134
Don't let him kill me.

780
01:13:57,890 --> 01:14:01,935
I can't hold it any longer.

781
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:04,145
I can't. I'm weak.

782
01:14:04,146 --> 01:14:06,231
I'm too weak.

783
01:14:06,232 --> 01:14:07,774
Anakin!

784
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:12,775
Help me. Help me!

785
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:17,033
I can't hold on any longer.

786
01:14:17,034 --> 01:14:20,745
I am going to end this once and for all.

787
01:14:20,746 --> 01:14:22,330
You can't.

788
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:25,333
He must stand trial.

789
01:14:25,334 --> 01:14:27,877
He has control of the senate and the courts.

790
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:30,213
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

791
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:32,590
I'm too weak.

792
01:14:32,591 --> 01:14:36,303
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not thejedi way.

793
01:14:36,304 --> 01:14:40,932
He must live.

794
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:44,519
- Please don't.
- I need him.

795
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:49,520
Please don't!

796
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:58,029
Power!

797
01:15:01,203 --> 01:15:06,203
Unlimited power!

798
01:15:17,011 --> 01:15:22,011
What have I done?

799
01:15:27,355 --> 01:15:32,355
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

800
01:15:32,485 --> 01:15:35,320
Become my apprentice.

801
01:15:35,321 --> 01:15:40,321
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

802
01:15:43,412 --> 01:15:48,412
I will do whatever you ask.

803
01:15:48,584 --> 01:15:52,712
Good.

804
01:15:52,713 --> 01:15:57,258
Just help me save Padmé's life.

805
01:15:57,259 --> 01:16:02,259
I can't live without her.

806
01:16:02,807 --> 01:16:07,807
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

807
01:16:08,312 --> 01:16:11,398
but if we work together...

808
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:16,399
I know we can discover the secret.

809
01:16:16,862 --> 01:16:20,573
I pledge myself...

810
01:16:20,574 --> 01:16:23,701
to your teachings.

811
01:16:23,702 --> 01:16:26,621
Good.

812
01:16:26,622 --> 01:16:31,622
Good.

813
01:16:36,674 --> 01:16:41,219
The Force is strong with you.

814
01:16:41,220 --> 01:16:46,220
A powerful Sith you will become.

815
01:16:46,892 --> 01:16:51,271
Henceforth you shall be known as...

816
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:56,272
Darth... Vader.

817
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:05,114
Thank you, my master.

818
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:10,327
Rise.

819
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,260
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

820
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:31,974
I believe you are the onlyjedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

821
01:17:33,063 --> 01:17:35,899
When thejedi learn
what has transpired here...

822
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,695
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

823
01:17:40,696 --> 01:17:42,780
I agree.

824
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:46,784
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

825
01:17:46,785 --> 01:17:49,579
Every single Jedi...

826
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:52,957
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi...

827
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:57,545
is now an enemy of the Republic.

828
01:17:57,546 --> 01:18:00,298
I understand, Master.

829
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:02,342
We must move quickly.

830
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:04,385
Thejedi are relentless.

831
01:18:04,386 --> 01:18:09,386
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

832
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:16,773
First I want you to go to thejedi temple.

833
01:18:16,774 --> 01:18:19,943
We will catch them off-balance.

834
01:18:19,944 --> 01:18:24,030
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

835
01:18:24,031 --> 01:18:28,117
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

836
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:32,997
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

837
01:18:32,998 --> 01:18:36,125
to save Padmé.

838
01:18:36,126 --> 01:18:40,088
What about the otherjedi
spread across the galaxy?

839
01:18:40,089 --> 01:18:45,089
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

840
01:18:45,094 --> 01:18:48,471
After you have killed
all thejedi in the temple...

841
01:18:48,472 --> 01:18:51,266
go to the Mustafar system.

842
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:54,644
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

843
01:18:54,645 --> 01:18:58,189
and the other separatist leaders.

844
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:03,190
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

845
01:19:05,322 --> 01:19:07,156
And...

846
01:19:07,157 --> 01:19:12,157
we shall have... peace.

847
01:19:55,456 --> 01:19:58,374
Sergeant, over here!

848
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:03,087
Hurry! All of them!

849
01:20:03,088 --> 01:20:05,089
<i>All Red units, let's move it!</i>

850
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:10,090
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

851
01:20:20,856 --> 01:20:22,982
Commander, contact your troops.

852
01:20:22,983 --> 01:20:25,026
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

853
01:20:25,027 --> 01:20:27,028
Very good, sir.

854
01:20:27,029 --> 01:20:29,989
By the way, I think you'll be needing this.

855
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:33,660
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

856
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:38,661
Yes, sir.

857
01:20:41,627 --> 01:20:43,795
<i>Commander Cody...</i>

858
01:20:43,796 --> 01:20:47,215
the time has come.

859
01:20:47,216 --> 01:20:52,216
Execute order 66.

860
01:20:52,221 --> 01:20:57,221
Yes, my lord.

861
01:20:58,018 --> 01:21:03,018
Blast him!

862
01:21:26,338 --> 01:21:31,338
Come on!

863
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:22,435
<i>Execute order 66.</i>

864
01:22:22,436 --> 01:22:27,436
It will be done, my lord.

865
01:23:06,897 --> 01:23:11,897
It will be done, my lord.

866
01:23:45,727 --> 01:23:48,229
Master Skywalker, there are too many of them.

867
01:23:48,230 --> 01:23:53,230
What are we going to do?

868
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:04,954
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to thejedi temple.

869
01:24:04,955 --> 01:24:09,955
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be all right.

870
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:40,448
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

871
01:24:40,449 --> 01:24:43,826
Don't worry. The situation is under control.

872
01:24:43,827 --> 01:24:48,122
I'm sorry, sir. it's time for you to leave.

873
01:24:48,123 --> 01:24:53,123
And so it is.

874
01:24:54,212 --> 01:24:59,212
Get him!

875
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:18,231
Don't worry about him. Let him go.

876
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:45,054
All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

877
01:25:45,055 --> 01:25:50,055
Yes, sir.

878
01:25:54,648 --> 01:25:56,649
Good-bye, Ta rfful.

879
01:25:56,650 --> 01:26:01,195
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

880
01:26:01,196 --> 01:26:06,196
Miss you I will.

881
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,820
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a fewjedi...

882
01:26:42,821 --> 01:26:47,821
before they walk into this catastrophe.

883
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:52,913
Did you find Kenobi?

884
01:26:52,914 --> 01:26:55,875
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

885
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:58,335
Start loading your men on the ships.

886
01:26:58,336 --> 01:27:03,336
Move it.

887
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:35,247
Emergency code 913.

888
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:39,877
I have no contact on any frequency.

889
01:27:39,878 --> 01:27:41,420
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

890
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:43,506
<i>- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.</i>

891
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:48,427
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

892
01:27:48,428 --> 01:27:50,429
<i>We have just rescued Master Yoda.</i>

893
01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:52,640
<i>It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.</i>

894
01:27:52,641 --> 01:27:57,641
<i>We're sending you our coordinates.</i>

895
01:28:02,526 --> 01:28:04,527
Hush! Not so loud.

896
01:28:04,528 --> 01:28:07,655
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on thejedi temple.

897
01:28:07,656 --> 01:28:10,157
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

898
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:12,159
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

899
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:14,662
What's happening?

900
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:17,498
Thejedi have tried to overthrow the Republic.

901
01:28:17,499 --> 01:28:19,500
I can't believe that.

902
01:28:19,501 --> 01:28:24,501
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

903
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:30,841
What are you gonna do?

904
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:40,521
I will not betray the Republic.

905
01:28:40,522 --> 01:28:43,607
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

906
01:28:43,608 --> 01:28:47,111
and with the senate and with you.

907
01:28:47,112 --> 01:28:51,073
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

908
01:28:51,074 --> 01:28:53,284
Manyjedi have been killed.

909
01:28:53,285 --> 01:28:57,204
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

910
01:28:57,205 --> 01:29:02,205
Anakin, I'm afraid.

911
01:29:02,544 --> 01:29:04,712
Have faith, my love.

912
01:29:04,713 --> 01:29:07,798
Everything will soon be set right.

913
01:29:07,799 --> 01:29:11,010
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

914
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:14,597
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

915
01:29:14,598 --> 01:29:18,559
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

916
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:23,560
Things will be different. I promise.

917
01:29:26,776 --> 01:29:31,776
Please, wait for me.

918
01:29:32,824 --> 01:29:37,786
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

919
01:29:37,787 --> 01:29:42,787
Take care, my little friend.

920
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:47,796
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

921
01:29:47,797 --> 01:29:52,718
No, thank you, 3P0.

922
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:57,719
I feel so helpless.

923
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:21,455
How many otherjedi have managed to survive?

924
01:30:21,456 --> 01:30:24,875
Heard from no one have we.

925
01:30:24,876 --> 01:30:28,087
I saw thousands of troops
attack thejedi temple.

926
01:30:28,088 --> 01:30:30,089
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

927
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,633
Have we had any contact from the temple?

928
01:30:32,634 --> 01:30:36,470
Received a coded retreat message we have.

929
01:30:36,471 --> 01:30:39,848
It requests all Jedi to return to the temple.

930
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:43,394
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

931
01:30:43,395 --> 01:30:48,065
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

932
01:30:48,066 --> 01:30:51,944
Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

933
01:30:51,945 --> 01:30:55,781
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

934
01:30:55,782 --> 01:30:57,449
I agree.

935
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:02,450
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

936
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:25,561
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

937
01:31:25,562 --> 01:31:28,439
<i>You have done well, Viceroy.</i>

938
01:31:28,440 --> 01:31:33,440
<i>When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives...</i>

939
01:31:34,362 --> 01:31:39,362
<i>he will take care of you.</i>

940
01:31:50,253 --> 01:31:52,755
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

941
01:31:52,756 --> 01:31:56,425
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:31:56,426 --> 01:32:01,221
<i>Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...</i>

943
01:32:01,222 --> 01:32:03,307
<i>at a special session of Congress.</i>

944
01:32:03,308 --> 01:32:08,308
- I will <i>be</i> there.
- <i>He '// be expecting you.</i>

945
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:13,233
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

946
01:32:13,234 --> 01:32:16,445
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

947
01:32:16,446 --> 01:32:19,198
without keeping the senate intact.

948
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,618
If a special session of Congress there is...

949
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:27,619
easier for us to enter
thejedi temple it will be.

950
01:33:04,411 --> 01:33:09,411
R2, stay with the ship.

951
01:33:31,813 --> 01:33:36,813
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

952
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:11,310
And thejedi rebellion has been foiled.

953
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:12,478
What's happened?

954
01:34:12,479 --> 01:34:17,107
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by thejedi to overthrow the senate.

955
01:34:17,108 --> 01:34:22,108
The remainingjedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

956
01:34:38,379 --> 01:34:41,965
Not even the younglings survived.

957
01:34:41,966 --> 01:34:46,966
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

958
01:34:48,348 --> 01:34:53,348
By a lightsaber he was.

959
01:34:57,857 --> 01:34:59,525
Who?

960
01:34:59,526 --> 01:35:04,526
Who could have done this?

961
01:35:12,121 --> 01:35:15,415
The attempt on my life...

962
01:35:15,416 --> 01:35:20,416
has left me scarred and deformed.

963
01:35:21,256 --> 01:35:24,258
But I assure you.

964
01:35:24,259 --> 01:35:29,259
My resolve has never been stronger!

965
01:35:33,184 --> 01:35:38,184
Stop!

966
01:35:47,365 --> 01:35:52,365
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

967
01:35:53,121 --> 01:35:57,124
the Republic will be reorganized...

968
01:35:57,125 --> 01:36:02,125
into the first Galactic Empire!

969
01:36:03,506 --> 01:36:08,506
For a safe and secure society.

970
01:36:18,771 --> 01:36:21,565
So this is how liberty dies.

971
01:36:21,566 --> 01:36:26,566
With thunderous applause.

972
01:36:26,696 --> 01:36:28,989
The war is over.

973
01:36:28,990 --> 01:36:33,990
Lord Sidious promised us peace. We only want-

974
01:36:41,252 --> 01:36:46,048
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all survivingjedi to stay away.

975
01:36:46,049 --> 01:36:48,592
For the clones...

976
01:36:48,593 --> 01:36:53,593
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

977
01:37:05,026 --> 01:37:08,028
Wait. Master.

978
01:37:08,029 --> 01:37:13,029
There is something I must know.

979
01:37:16,496 --> 01:37:21,041
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

980
01:37:21,042 --> 01:37:26,042
I must know the truth, Master.

981
01:37:31,386 --> 01:37:33,428
It can't be.

982
01:37:33,429 --> 01:37:35,430
It can't be.

983
01:37:35,431 --> 01:37:39,601
<i>You have clone well, my new apprentice.</i>

984
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:42,729
<i>Now, Lord Vader...</i>

985
01:37:42,730 --> 01:37:46,358
<i>go and bring peace to the Empire.</i>

986
01:37:46,359 --> 01:37:49,277
I can't watch any more.

987
01:37:49,278 --> 01:37:54,278
Destroy the Sith we must.

988
01:37:54,992 --> 01:37:57,202
Send me to kill the emperor.

989
01:37:57,203 --> 01:37:59,579
I will not kill Anakin.

990
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:04,418
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

991
01:38:04,419 --> 01:38:08,422
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

992
01:38:08,423 --> 01:38:13,423
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

993
01:38:13,594 --> 01:38:17,097
The boy you trained, gone he is.

994
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:20,100
Consumed by Darth Vader.

995
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:23,228
I do not know where the emperor has sent him.

996
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:26,773
I don't know where to look.

997
01:38:26,774 --> 01:38:31,774
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

998
01:38:40,997 --> 01:38:43,707
When was the last time you saw him?

999
01:38:43,708 --> 01:38:48,708
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

1000
01:38:50,256 --> 01:38:54,301
Padmé, I need your help.

1001
01:38:54,302 --> 01:38:57,721
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

1002
01:38:57,722 --> 01:39:02,722
From himself.

1003
01:39:03,644 --> 01:39:06,146
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

1004
01:39:06,147 --> 01:39:11,147
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

1005
01:39:12,403 --> 01:39:17,403
I have seen a security hologram... of him...

1006
01:39:19,035 --> 01:39:20,869
killing younglings.

1007
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:24,664
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

1008
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:27,834
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

1009
01:39:27,835 --> 01:39:32,835
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

1010
01:39:33,424 --> 01:39:36,259
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

1011
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:41,260
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

1012
01:39:46,562 --> 01:39:49,940
I don't believe you.

1013
01:39:49,941 --> 01:39:54,941
I can%.

1014
01:39:59,617 --> 01:40:03,995
I must find him.

1015
01:40:03,996 --> 01:40:08,996
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

1016
01:40:10,044 --> 01:40:15,044
He has become a very great threat.

1017
01:40:15,132 --> 01:40:20,132
I can%.

1018
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:35,314
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

1019
01:40:36,654 --> 01:40:41,654
I'm so sorry.

1020
01:41:24,452 --> 01:41:26,786
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

1021
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:29,080
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

1022
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:31,583
As you wish, milady, but I strongly disagree.

1023
01:41:31,584 --> 01:41:35,337
<i>I'll</i> be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

1024
01:41:35,338 --> 01:41:39,966
Besides, 3P0 will look after me.

1025
01:41:39,967 --> 01:41:44,967
Oh, dear.

1026
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:58,397
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

1027
01:42:25,388 --> 01:42:28,932
<i>The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.</i>

1028
01:42:28,933 --> 01:42:33,228
It is finished then.

1029
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:38,229
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

1030
01:42:39,819 --> 01:42:44,819
<i>Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.</i>

1031
01:42:44,865 --> 01:42:49,865
<i>All droid units must shut down immediately.</i>

1032
01:42:50,204 --> 01:42:55,204
Very good, my lord.

1033
01:43:51,432 --> 01:43:56,352
I saw your ship.

1034
01:43:56,353 --> 01:44:00,815
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

1035
01:44:00,816 --> 01:44:03,777
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

1036
01:44:03,778 --> 01:44:06,029
What things?

1037
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:09,074
He said you've turned to the dark side.

1038
01:44:09,075 --> 01:44:14,075
That you... killed younglings.

1039
01:44:15,247 --> 01:44:18,041
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

1040
01:44:18,042 --> 01:44:20,627
He cares about us.

1041
01:44:20,628 --> 01:44:21,920
U5?

1042
01:44:21,921 --> 01:44:24,756
He knows.

1043
01:44:24,757 --> 01:44:29,757
He wants to help you.

1044
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:33,848
Anakin, all I want is your love.

1045
01:44:33,849 --> 01:44:36,309
Love won't save you, Padmé.

1046
01:44:36,310 --> 01:44:39,646
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

1047
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:42,148
You're a good person. Don't do this.

1048
01:44:42,149 --> 01:44:44,984
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

1049
01:44:44,985 --> 01:44:49,322
I am becoming more powerful
than anyjedi has ever dreamed of.

1050
01:44:49,323 --> 01:44:53,451
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

1051
01:44:53,452 --> 01:44:56,162
Come away with me.

1052
01:44:56,163 --> 01:44:58,289
Help me raise our child.

1053
01:44:58,290 --> 01:45:01,209
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

1054
01:45:01,210 --> 01:45:05,964
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away anymore.

1055
01:45:05,965 --> 01:45:09,509
I have brought peace to the Republic.

1056
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:11,553
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

1057
01:45:11,554 --> 01:45:15,723
I can overthrow him.

1058
01:45:15,724 --> 01:45:18,893
And together, you and I can rule the galaxy...

1059
01:45:18,894 --> 01:45:23,894
make things the way we want them to be.

1060
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:31,156
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

1061
01:45:31,157 --> 01:45:36,157
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

1062
01:45:36,662 --> 01:45:40,373
I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan.

1063
01:45:40,374 --> 01:45:45,374
Thejedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

1064
01:45:45,504 --> 01:45:50,504
I don't know you anymore.

1065
01:45:51,218 --> 01:45:53,887
You're breaking my heart.

1066
01:45:53,888 --> 01:45:57,849
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1067
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:00,518
Because of Obi-Wan?

1068
01:46:00,519 --> 01:46:02,729
Because of what you've done.

1069
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:05,899
What you plan to do.

1070
01:46:05,900 --> 01:46:08,651
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1071
01:46:08,652 --> 01:46:13,652
- I love you.
- Liar!

1072
01:46:16,410 --> 01:46:21,410
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1073
01:46:21,624 --> 01:46:26,419
Let her go, Anakin.

1074
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:31,420
Let her go.

1075
01:46:38,599 --> 01:46:42,227
You turned her against me!

1076
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:47,228
You have done that yourself.

1077
01:46:49,151 --> 01:46:51,444
You will not take her from me!

1078
01:46:51,445 --> 01:46:56,445
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1079
01:46:59,245 --> 01:47:04,245
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

1080
01:47:05,167 --> 01:47:08,461
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1081
01:47:08,462 --> 01:47:10,463
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1082
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:14,092
I see through the lies of thejedi.

1083
01:47:14,093 --> 01:47:18,304
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1084
01:47:18,305 --> 01:47:20,348
I have brought peace...

1085
01:47:20,349 --> 01:47:25,349
freedom,justice and security
to my new empire.

1086
01:47:26,105 --> 01:47:29,065
Your new empire?

1087
01:47:29,066 --> 01:47:32,485
Don't make me kill you.

1088
01:47:32,486 --> 01:47:37,486
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

1089
01:47:37,866 --> 01:47:40,743
If you're not with <i>me...</i>

1090
01:47:40,744 --> 01:47:44,664
then you're my enemy.

1091
01:47:44,665 --> 01:47:49,665
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1092
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:52,255
I will do what I must.

1093
01:47:52,256 --> 01:47:57,256
You will try.

1094
01:48:26,415 --> 01:48:30,543
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1095
01:48:30,544 --> 01:48:35,131
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1096
01:48:35,132 --> 01:48:37,842
Master Yoda.

1097
01:48:37,843 --> 01:48:40,386
You survived.

1098
01:48:40,387 --> 01:48:42,472
Surprised?

1099
01:48:42,473 --> 01:48:47,185
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1100
01:48:47,186 --> 01:48:49,354
Now you will experience...

1101
01:48:49,355 --> 01:48:54,355
the full power of the dark side.

1102
01:49:35,776 --> 01:49:40,776
I have waited a long time for this moment...

1103
01:49:41,573 --> 01:49:46,573
my little green friend.

1104
01:49:56,964 --> 01:50:00,550
At last thejedi are no more.

1105
01:50:00,551 --> 01:50:05,551
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1106
01:50:10,102 --> 01:50:14,313
At an end your rule is.

1107
01:50:14,314 --> 01:50:19,314
And not short enough it was.

1108
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:24,991
If so powerful you are...

1109
01:50:24,992 --> 01:50:27,410
why leave?

1110
01:50:27,411 --> 01:50:30,079
You will not stop me.

1111
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:34,792
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1112
01:50:34,793 --> 01:50:39,793
Faith in your new apprentice misplaced may be.

1113
01:50:40,466 --> 01:50:45,466
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1114
01:55:12,154 --> 01:55:14,989
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1115
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:17,908
Activate your homing beacon when you're ready.

1116
01:55:17,909 --> 01:55:20,369
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1117
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:24,123
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1118
01:55:24,124 --> 01:55:27,460
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1119
01:55:27,461 --> 01:55:31,672
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1120
01:55:31,673 --> 01:55:36,673
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1121
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:49,458
Into exile I must go.

1122
01:56:49,459 --> 01:56:54,459
Failed I have.

1123
01:58:30,977 --> 01:58:33,020
I have failed you, Anakin.

1124
01:58:33,021 --> 01:58:35,022
I have failed you.

1125
01:58:35,023 --> 01:58:38,025
I should have known thejedi
were plotting to take over.

1126
01:58:38,026 --> 01:58:40,945
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1127
01:58:40,946 --> 01:58:43,697
From my point of view, thejedi are evil.

1128
01:58:43,698 --> 01:58:48,698
Then you are lost!

1129
01:58:57,170 --> 01:59:02,170
This is the end for you, my master.

1130
01:59:24,197 --> 01:59:29,197
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1131
01:59:29,995 --> 01:59:33,455
You underestimate my power.

1132
01:59:33,456 --> 01:59:38,456
Don't try it.

1133
01:59:58,064 --> 02:00:01,525
You were the chosen one!

1134
02:00:01,526 --> 02:00:06,526
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1135
02:00:07,365 --> 02:00:12,365
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1136
02:00:22,839 --> 02:00:27,839
I hate you!

1137
02:00:32,599 --> 02:00:36,935
You were my brother, Anakin.

1138
02:00:36,936 --> 02:00:41,936
I loved you.

1139
02:01:20,313 --> 02:01:23,357
Master Kenobi. We have Miss Padmé on board.

1140
02:01:23,358 --> 02:01:25,567
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1141
02:01:25,568 --> 02:01:30,568
We should leave this dreadful place.

1142
02:01:43,962 --> 02:01:48,962
Is Anakin all right?

1143
02:02:54,741 --> 02:02:57,659
Your Majesty, this way.

1144
02:02:57,660 --> 02:02:59,661
There he is.

1145
02:02:59,662 --> 02:03:04,662
He's still alive.

1146
02:03:04,834 --> 02:03:07,169
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1147
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:12,170
Yes, sir. Right away.

1148
02:03:45,124 --> 02:03:50,124
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1149
02:03:52,966 --> 02:03:57,966
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1150
02:04:11,985 --> 02:04:16,985
We'll take her to the medical center. Quickly.

1151
02:04:44,726 --> 02:04:47,060
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1152
02:04:47,061 --> 02:04:51,648
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1153
02:04:51,649 --> 02:04:54,484
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1154
02:04:54,485 --> 02:04:56,653
She has lost the will to live.

1155
02:04:56,654 --> 02:04:59,906
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1156
02:04:59,907 --> 02:05:01,616
Babies?

1157
02:05:01,617 --> 02:05:06,617
She's carrying twins.

1158
02:05:45,661 --> 02:05:50,661
Luke.

1159
02:05:55,338 --> 02:06:00,338
Oh, Luke.

1160
02:06:19,278 --> 02:06:24,278
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1161
02:07:11,080 --> 02:07:15,667
There's good in him.

1162
02:07:15,668 --> 02:07:17,752
I know.

1163
02:07:17,753 --> 02:07:22,753
I know there's... still-

1164
02:07:56,584 --> 02:07:59,377
Lord Vader.

1165
02:07:59,378 --> 02:08:04,378
Can you hear me?

1166
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:09,137
Yes, Master.

1167
02:08:09,138 --> 02:08:12,849
Where is Padmé?

1168
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:15,852
Is she safe?

1169
02:08:15,853 --> 02:08:19,564
Is she all right?

1170
02:08:19,565 --> 02:08:24,565
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1171
02:08:25,154 --> 02:08:28,156
I? I couldn't have.

1172
02:08:28,157 --> 02:08:33,157
She was alive. I felt it!

1173
02:08:50,930 --> 02:08:55,930
No!

1174
02:09:05,111 --> 02:09:10,111
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1175
02:09:10,533 --> 02:09:15,533
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1176
02:09:16,622 --> 02:09:19,457
Split up they should be.

1177
02:09:19,458 --> 02:09:22,961
My wife and I will take the girl.

1178
02:09:22,962 --> 02:09:25,964
We've always talked of adopting a baby girl.

1179
02:09:25,965 --> 02:09:29,134
She will be loved with us.

1180
02:09:29,135 --> 02:09:32,053
And what of the boy?

1181
02:09:32,054 --> 02:09:37,054
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1182
02:09:37,393 --> 02:09:42,393
I will take the child and watch over him.

1183
02:09:45,276 --> 02:09:50,276
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1184
02:09:50,781 --> 02:09:55,781
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1185
02:09:55,911 --> 02:10:00,911
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1186
02:10:02,460 --> 02:10:03,877
Training?

1187
02:10:03,878 --> 02:10:08,878
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1188
02:10:10,509 --> 02:10:13,720
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1189
02:10:13,721 --> 02:10:16,848
Your old master.

1190
02:10:16,849 --> 02:10:20,852
QUFGon?

1191
02:10:20,853 --> 02:10:25,607
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1192
02:10:25,608 --> 02:10:27,859
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1193
02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:29,861
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1194
02:10:29,862 --> 02:10:31,863
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1195
02:10:31,864 --> 02:10:33,865
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1196
02:10:33,866 --> 02:10:37,202
What?

1197
02:10:37,203 --> 02:10:42,203
Oh, no!

1198
02:10:42,228 --> 02:20:42,228

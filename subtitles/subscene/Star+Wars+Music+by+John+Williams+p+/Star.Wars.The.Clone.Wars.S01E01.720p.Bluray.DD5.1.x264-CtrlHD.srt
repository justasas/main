greater security than your Jedi.

But should my droids defeat Yoda,
consider an alliance with the Separatists.

Deceive you eyes can.

170
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:17,730
In the Force,
very different each one of you are.

171
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,569
Rys, always focused on the enemy are you.

172
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:27,949
For inspiration,
look to yourself and those beside you.

173
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:35,999
Jjeck, concerned about weapons you are.
Weapons do not win battles.

174
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:41,462
Your mind, powerful it is.
Outthink the droids you can.

175
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:47,802
Thire, rush not into fights. Long is the war.

176
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,390
Only by surviving it will you prevail. Yes.

177
00:14:54,852 --> 00:15:00,231
Clones you may be,
but the Force resides in all life forms.

178
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,151
Use it you can to quiet your mind.

179
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,905
(RUMBLING)

180
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,831
Tanks. Is that the best
they can throw at us?

181
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,001
Yeah, but I've only got one shot left.

182
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,377
Greet them I will.

183
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,006
General, you don't plan to take
that whole column by yourself?

184
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,883
(LAUGHS)

185
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,011
Have you three I do.
Outnumbered are they.

186
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,515
Know the time to help me you will.

187
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,698
It's the Jedi! Block his escape!

188
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,076
Prepare to fire!

189
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,292
<i>Supreme Leader, we've found the Jedi.</i>

190
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:06,381
-Excellent. Where is he?
<i>-He's just sitting here in front of our tanks.</i>

191
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,050
Shoot him! Shoot him now!

192
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,637
Quickly! Ready, aim, fire!

193
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,764
Fire!

194
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,650
DROID COMMANDER:
He's going under the tank!

195
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,325
Oh, no!

196
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,578
Run for it!

197
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,917
But I just got promoted!

198
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,466
CLONE: It doesn't look like
the General needs help to me.

199
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,432
(BEEPING)

200
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,142
We've got him in our sights!

201
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,359
(DROID SCREAMING)

202
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,447
(LAUGHING)

203
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,450
That's a lot of smoke for a surrender.

204
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,997
Report. What's going on over there?
224, come in!

205
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,167
Where is 224?

206
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,837
<i>Destroyed, Supreme Leader.</i>
<i>The Jedi has overrun our position and...</i>

207
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,963
<i>(SCREAMS)</i>

208
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:35,136
l think perhaps all those stories
about the Jedi are true.

209
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,306
The fight isn't over yet, Majesty.

210
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,975
(BEEPS)

211
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,527
CLONE: The General's cutting them up.

212
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,695
(ALL LAUGHING)

213
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,990
We got trouble.
The clankers sent reinforcements.

214
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,245
The General's too busy with that tank.
He won't see them coming.

215
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,664
I think I know how to deal with them.

216
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,690
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

217
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,944
-Great shot, sir!
-That's giving it to the clankers!

218
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,035
YODA: Hmm.

219
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,372
Learned something today,
have you, Lieutenant, hmm?

220
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,874
l think we all did, General.

221
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,924
Come, behind schedule are we.
Not polite to be late.

222
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:10,314
You were right, Count Dooku.
One Jedi is not worth 100 battle droids.

223
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,900
More like 1,000!

224
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,112
I’m sorry,
but I will be joining the Republic.

225
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,574
<i>I urge you to reconsider, wise king.</i>

226
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,659
<i>I promise you won't regret it.</i>

227
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,496
Your agent also promised me
Yoda would get a fair fight.

228
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,332
I will not deal with those
who break their words.

229
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,751
<i>So be it.</i>

230
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:35,089
<i>Perhaps our negotiations</i>
<i>will more fruitful with your successor.</i>

231
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,258
<i>Ventress! Kill him!</i>

232
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,022
(VENTRESS GRUNTING)

233
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:59,780
Jedi Master Yoda.
I am very pleased to meet you at last.

234
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,534
Share the feeling I do, King Katuunko.

235
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,290
Failed you Ventress has, Count.

236
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,710
I don't fear you, Jedi.

237
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,838
Strong you are with the dark side,
young one,

238
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,215
but not that strong.

239
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,304
Still much to learn you have.

240
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,142
Surrender you should.

241
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,522
(EXPLOSION)

242
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,038
Hmm.

243
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,875
In the end, cowards are those
who follow the dark side.

244
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,796
<i>It’s a pity I wasn't there in person,</i>
<i>my old master.</i>

245
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,466
A pity indeed, my fallen apprentice.

246
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,805
Perhaps now begin negotiations we can.

247
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:10,226
That is not necessary, my friend.
You have my faith.

248
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,938
Toydaria would be honored
to host a Republic base.

249
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,233
My people are at your service.

250
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,362
Your Majesty, fail you we will not.

251
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,488
(RUMBLING)

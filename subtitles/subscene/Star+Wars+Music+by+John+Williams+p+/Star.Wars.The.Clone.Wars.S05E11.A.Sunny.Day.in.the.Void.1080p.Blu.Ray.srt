1
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,287
<i>Secret weapons!</i>

2
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,891
<i>The Jedi Council deploys
a squad of droids</i>

3
00:00:22,925 --> 00:00:25,995
<i>on a desperate mission
aboard a Separatist cruiser.</i>

4
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:28,298
<i>Under the guidance
of Colonel Meebur Gascon,</i>

5
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:32,436
<i>the droids succeed in stealing
a crucial encryption module.</i>

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,706
<i>Now the colonel and his droid squad</i>

7
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,410
<i>must return the module
to the Jedi Temple</i>

8
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:39,146
<i>to crack a Separatist code</i>

9
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:43,118
<i>detailing an impending terror
plot against the Republic.</i>

10
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:49,425
How long until my command
center is operational again?

11
00:00:51,863 --> 00:00:54,332
Okay, fine.

12
00:00:54,367 --> 00:00:58,972
I meant how long until Beezee
is operational again?

13
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,110
Well, make it fast.

14
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:05,147
We must get this encryption
module back to the Republic

15
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:06,983
as soon as possible.

16
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:20,702
Uh-oh.

17
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,450
Oh, Beezee, you are all better.

18
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,021
WAC, what are you doing back here?

19
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:37,658
Who is flying this shuttle?

20
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:40,028
I have good news and bad news, Colonel.

21
00:01:40,063 --> 00:01:43,099
The bad news is, scans are
picking up giant ice formations,

22
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,002
commonly called comets,
heading straight for us.

23
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:47,103
What? Wha...

24
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:50,575
What in the world is the good news?

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,177
At least you have a good excuse

26
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,314
if your mission is a failure.

27
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:57,185
Get out of my...

28
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:11,036
Quick, drop us out of hyperspace.

29
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:19,949
Whoa!

30
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:25,156
Look out!

31
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Whoa!

32
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,810
The shuttle's power system
has been knocked out.

33
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:41,746
I can see that.

34
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,952
He says he can fix it.

35
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,985
And swinging right.

36
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,837
Auxiliary power has been restored,

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,639
but it is not enough to get us moving.

38
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,576
We need the primary motivators
reestablished now.

39
00:03:29,611 --> 00:03:30,611
Forget that.

40
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,080
We need the engines to come on.

41
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:34,183
That's what I'm saying.

42
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:46,967
Uh-oh.
They just got bigger.

43
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,973
Come on, you lousy mechs.

44
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,483
Uh, Colonel,
we are headed for that comet.

45
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:00,018
Brace yourself!

46
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:07,195
The engines are back online!

47
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,241
Ah!

48
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:41,207
Whoa! Whoa!

49
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,944
Whoa!

50
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:11,248
We have lost the stabilizers

51
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,217
and primary control of the engines.

52
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:17,390
We are going to have
to put her down on that planet.

53
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,295
What planet is it?

54
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:22,798
Is it Separatist-controlled?

55
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:23,832
Who cares?

56
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,900
I care.

57
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:27,003
We can't jeopardize the mission.

58
00:05:27,037 --> 00:05:29,474
I think we are past that point, sir.

59
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,411
We're going down!

60
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:12,767
Ugh. Oh.

61
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,805
I think I ruptured my gizzard.

62
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:48,184
Well, this is a fine mess
you mechs got us into.

63
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:52,123
Look at this.

64
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:53,725
All the database says is,

65
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,265
"Abafar. Information
void."

66
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:01,403
Don't be absurd.

67
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:03,673
We can't just go rushing off like fools

68
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,375
into this... this void.

69
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:07,879
We need to stay put,
consider all the facts,

70
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:10,816
and then I'll, uh... I'll draw up
a reconnaissance plan,

71
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,786
and we can...
hey, hey!

72
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,755
Where are you going, soldier?

73
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,229
He says we have to finish our mission.

74
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,068
Hey!
Where did you get that?

75
00:07:25,104 --> 00:07:28,340
That is classified material.

76
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,448
I will not stand for insubordination.

77
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,749
Do not worry, Colonel.

78
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:36,518
I can lead the mission from here

79
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:38,120
and return the module.

80
00:07:38,154 --> 00:07:41,357
Maybe they'll give <i>me</i> a promotion.

81
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:43,794
Over my dead body.

82
00:07:43,828 --> 00:07:45,830
Beezee, pop your top.

83
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:50,404
I will not let you droids
commandeer my mission.

84
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:22,379
Ugh, so hot.

85
00:08:25,084 --> 00:08:27,753
Ugh, I can't believe I came this close

86
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:29,923
to completing my first mission

87
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,829
only to get lost
in this detestable desert.

88
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:35,597
Look on the bright side, Colonel.

89
00:08:35,631 --> 00:08:37,767
At least it is a sunny day.

90
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:40,771
What sun?
I don't see any sun.

91
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:44,177
It's just hot and oppressive.

92
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,345
Wait a minute.

93
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,981
There's no sun.

94
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,285
How do we know
which direction we're going?

95
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,726
You set your directional
guidance to "straight"?

96
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,361
That's all we're going on,

97
00:08:57,395 --> 00:09:00,198
some rudimentary programming directive

98
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,535
in a lousy astromech?

99
00:09:06,776 --> 00:09:09,779
Yes, I know you're designed
for navigation,

100
00:09:09,813 --> 00:09:11,815
but that requires map coordinates

101
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,617
and environmental input...

102
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,687
something we are sorely lacking here.

103
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,893
All right, we can't rely on technology.

104
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,262
We have to rely on my training,

105
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:25,633
something you droids don't have.

106
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:28,671
How do you know, Colonel?

107
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:31,074
Because droids don't get training.

108
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,275
You get programmed.

109
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,011
Clang!

110
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:36,414
That's your weakness.

111
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,820
So how is your training going
to lead us out of this void?

112
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:45,227
Well, uh, my, uh, training
as an officer tells me

113
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:48,364
to use all available resources
to, uh...

114
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,302
to stay alive until help comes.

115
00:09:51,336 --> 00:09:53,438
So your officer training...

116
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,241
how exactly did you learn that?

117
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:58,845
It was drilled into me by my superiors.

118
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,213
Then you were programmed.

119
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:01,915
Just like us.

120
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,050
What?

121
00:10:03,084 --> 00:10:05,888
No, I am not like you droids in any way.

122
00:10:05,922 --> 00:10:08,959
I can think outside
my program...

123
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:10,527
I mean, my training.

124
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,864
And I can make decisions based
on a complex analysis

125
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,333
of a situation,

126
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:19,104
which is why I insist we return
to the ship.

127
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:20,273
Wait a minute.

128
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,309
Why can't I find our tracks?

129
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,011
There are not any.

130
00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:25,413
What?

131
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:26,681
I noticed it earlier.

132
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,250
This surface leaves no trace of us.

133
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:31,053
You noticed it earlier?

134
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:34,457
Why in the world
didn't you say anything?

135
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:36,727
I did not think we would want
to go backwards

136
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,031
when forwards seems to be
the only way out of this void.

137
00:10:41,301 --> 00:10:43,302
Why are you thinking?

138
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:44,871
I don't want you to think.

139
00:10:44,906 --> 00:10:46,573
Thinking is my job.

140
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,576
I am the commanding officer.

141
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,879
You are just a pilot.

142
00:10:50,947 --> 00:10:53,483
Oh, that hurt.

143
00:10:53,518 --> 00:10:55,887
Ugh.

144
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,756
I have been thinking, Colonel.

145
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,093
I told you not to do that.

146
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,997
My programming keeps me
focused on the task at hand,

147
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:06,735
which means I do not have
to worry about my health.

148
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,470
I just have to worry about the mission.

149
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:10,573
Don't even go there.

150
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:11,942
So I think...

151
00:11:11,976 --> 00:11:13,677
Don't do that!

152
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:17,016
When you die,
I should lead D-Squad.

153
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,918
Stop!

154
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,625
You are what's killing me!

155
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:27,096
I can't believe I am forced
to justify my existence

156
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,665
with a droid!

157
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,601
Ugh! I'm at the end!

158
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:31,936
I can feel it!

159
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,743
All I ask is that you
just let me die with dignity!

160
00:11:36,777 --> 00:11:39,313
Is that possible?

161
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:43,385
What?

162
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:45,355
Our ship?

163
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:52,498
You... you stupid lucky droids.

164
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:56,537
You have just taken us in a circle.

165
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:07,587
Wait a minute.

166
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:09,923
Is this really our ship?

167
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,395
How long have we been gone?

168
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,108
Ugh.

169
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,144
No, it is not our ship.

170
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,180
No, no, no!

171
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,684
No, no, no!

172
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,727
R2 is right.

173
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:40,232
This is what happens
when you stay at the ship.

174
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:43,602
Why is this happening to me?

175
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,058
Maybe he is going to jump

176
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,495
and put himself out of his misery.

177
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,500
Well, I vote for myself as
the new leader of this mission.

178
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:29,973
You cannot vote for R2.

179
00:13:30,007 --> 00:13:31,709
He is just a mech.

180
00:13:31,743 --> 00:13:33,311
He cannot lead a squadron.

181
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,986
Help!

182
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,858
There has to be something out there!

183
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:45,495
Show me a sign.

184
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,299
A glimmer of hope!

185
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,211
I do not know who he is talking to.

186
00:13:57,245 --> 00:13:59,214
Maybe whoever programmed him.

187
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,031
There!

188
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,167
I see something.

189
00:14:13,201 --> 00:14:14,703
Ooh, a village!

190
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,685
What are you waiting for?

191
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,153
We're saved!

192
00:14:46,215 --> 00:14:48,551
What exactly do you see, Colonel?

193
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,087
I don't know.

194
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:51,622
Hard to say.

195
00:14:51,656 --> 00:14:52,958
An outpost.

196
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:55,295
Maybe a cantina.

197
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,099
Whatever it is, they can help us.

198
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:06,677
I do not see anything either, R2.

199
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,279
He should have jumped.

200
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:37,752
No.

201
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:41,291
We're going in circles again.

202
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,481
I agree.

203
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:00,985
We cannot trust his training anymore.

204
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,622
But I cannot trust your
programming either,

205
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:06,994
especially if you will not vote
for me to be the new leader.

206
00:16:08,965 --> 00:16:10,399
Where are you going now?

207
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,806
Hey, that is not true.

208
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,777
I am more than just a pilot!

209
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,585
We need a new plan, Colonel.

210
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,154
I just realized:

211
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,189
what if I'm dead?

212
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:32,059
Ooh, what if I died
in that shuttle crash

213
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:36,099
and now... now I'm stuck here
in limbo?

214
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,600
Yes.

215
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:39,636
I should have gone with the mechs.

216
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:42,574
Think about it.

217
00:16:42,608 --> 00:16:45,077
Life.
Life is a void.

218
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,547
We search and search for answers,

219
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,082
but there are none.

220
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:51,552
Hope is just an illusion, WAC.

221
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:54,923
Death is the only certainty.

222
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:59,096
Giving up is not in my programming.

223
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,434
I am surprised that it
is in yours, Colonel.

224
00:17:10,213 --> 00:17:12,449
Maybe...

225
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,617
maybe you're right.

226
00:17:13,652 --> 00:17:16,622
I was taught to find a rational solution

227
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:18,324
to every problem.

228
00:17:18,358 --> 00:17:20,260
But this void...

229
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:24,433
this proves that that's not
always possible.

230
00:17:24,468 --> 00:17:27,204
Maybe I need to change how I see things,

231
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:29,140
and that will change my programming,

232
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,078
my training.

233
00:17:32,112 --> 00:17:33,180
You know what?

234
00:17:33,214 --> 00:17:36,251
You are more than just a pilot, WAC.

235
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,255
I knew it!
I knew it!

236
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:44,496
All right, all right,
calm down, soldier.

237
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:07,161
Whoa! Whoa!

238
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,873
This is our way out of the void!

239
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,042
You have lost your mind, Colonel!

240
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,343
No!

241
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:20,279
This is our only hope!

242
00:18:20,314 --> 00:18:22,983
We've got to stop following my training

243
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,753
or your programming

244
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:27,390
and follow the birds' instincts!

245
00:18:27,424 --> 00:18:29,826
Grab hold!

246
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:30,962
Like this?

247
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:32,664
Whoa!

248
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:00,032
Look.

249
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:03,303
I can see a town from here.

250
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,679
You can see that, right?

251
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,518
I sure can.

252
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:15,053
How did you know, Colonel,

253
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,056
that these creatures would
get us out of the void?

254
00:19:18,292 --> 00:19:19,960
You've got your programming.

255
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:21,930
I've got my training.

256
00:19:21,964 --> 00:19:24,933
But these creatures,
they have their instinct.

257
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:27,670
They know how to survive out here.

258
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:29,706
If you say so.

259
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:12,399
I don't believe it.

260
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,336
Those mechs beat us here.

261
00:20:15,371 --> 00:20:18,107
Stupid lucky droids.

262
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:20,978
Just like you said, Colonel.

263
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,314
Tell you what, WAC.

264
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:25,184
Why don't you get the squad
ready to roll?

265
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:28,155
I've got a second chance
to complete this mission,

266
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:30,860
and I intend to take advantage of it.

267
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:34,798
After I rehydrate myself.

268
00:20:34,832 --> 00:20:38,304
That'll be all, Corporal.

269
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:40,874
Corporal?

270
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:42,176
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,846
The squad will be ready to roll.

272
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:48,384
Attention!

273
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:50,887
Front and center, soldiers!

274
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:54,860
I want us ready to roll pronto, pronto!

275
00:20:57,898 --> 00:21:01,101
That is Corporal WAC to you, soldier.

276
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:04,906
And I will not tolerate insubordination!

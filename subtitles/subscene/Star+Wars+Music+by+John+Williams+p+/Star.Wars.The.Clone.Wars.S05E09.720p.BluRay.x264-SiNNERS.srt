1
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,486
<i>Pursued by pirates!</i>

2
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,921
<i>While on a rite of passage,</i>

3
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:25,759
<i>six Jedi younglings
and Ahsoka Tano are ambushed.</i>

4
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,393
<i>Protecting the young Jedi,</i>

5
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:30,496
<i>Ahsoka was captured by
the nefarious Hondo Ohnaka</i>

6
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,066
<i>and taken to the planet Florrum.</i>

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,235
<i>Marshalling their courage and training,</i>

8
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:37,903
<i>the younglings infiltrated
the pirate stronghold</i>

9
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,206
<i>and rescued Ahsoka.</i>

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,276
<i>Now we find our heroes
in a race to their starship,</i>

11
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>with the pirates closing in.</i>

12
00:00:59,863 --> 00:01:01,264
I know.
I see them.

13
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:02,298
They're gaining on us!

14
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,412
Uh, I think they're still
upset that we tricked them.

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,054
They'll get over it
once we're off their planet.

16
00:01:23,526 --> 00:01:25,060
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

17
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,094
Right.

18
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,598
Ganodi, we need a quick evac.

19
00:01:28,632 --> 00:01:29,699
Come in, please.

20
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:31,067
Ganodi.

21
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:32,868
Maybe the pirates
are jamming the signal.

22
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:35,539
Where could she be?

23
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:37,541
Ganodi. Huyang.
Come in.

24
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:44,881
Attaching your head took a lot longer

25
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,182
than I thought it would.

26
00:01:46,249 --> 00:01:48,150
This is appreciated, youngling.

27
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:50,686
Mobility is paramount,
especially in an emergency.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,122
<i>Ganodi, where are you?</i>

29
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:54,133
I'm here.

30
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:55,959
I was in the back fixing Huyang.

31
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:57,126
<i>Great.
That's great.</i>

32
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,461
But we're all gonna need repairs

33
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,062
if you don't have the engines running.

34
00:02:00,097 --> 00:02:01,364
Where are you?

35
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:02,733
Ganodi, it's Ahsoka.

36
00:02:03,768 --> 00:02:04,768
Padawan Tano!

37
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,036
We've rescued you.

38
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,304
Almost.

39
00:02:07,338 --> 00:02:09,006
But we need you to get us home.

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Are you ready?

41
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:11,543
Just tell me what I need to do.

42
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:14,747
Okay, fire up the engines
and head to these coordinates.

43
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,148
We'll be right there.

44
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:42,744
There they are!

45
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,380
R2, hold her steady
and lower the boarding ramp.

46
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,552
Come on!

47
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:07,874
Looks like our ride is here.

48
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:10,376
Everyone get topside and stay down.

49
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:14,482
But who's going to pilot the tank?

50
00:03:16,285 --> 00:03:18,053
Katooni, grab that mask.

51
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,424
Uh, that'll have to do.

52
00:03:41,448 --> 00:03:42,949
The steering must have come loose.

53
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:52,927
We got him!

54
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:55,263
Hang on!

55
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,338
Oh, no.

56
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,275
No, no, no!

57
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:23,827
They're coming back!

58
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,452
R2, get out of there now!

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,127
Everyone, let go!

60
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:54,395
Jump down now.

61
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,019
Nice try, little Jedi.

62
00:05:17,053 --> 00:05:19,788
But it looks like you're coming with us.

63
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:39,117
What the...

64
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:40,352
Droids?

65
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:44,523
It's an invasion.

66
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,850
Boss! Boss!

67
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:08,951
We're all in trouble!

68
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:09,986
Gah!

69
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,430
Hondo.

70
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,534
General Grievous, I presume?

71
00:06:23,568 --> 00:06:25,369
What a surprise.

72
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,436
Have a seat.

73
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:29,006
What, may I ask, is the honor?

74
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:33,711
You can dispense with
the pleasantries, pirate.

75
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:37,314
This planet is now under
Separatist control.

76
00:06:37,349 --> 00:06:39,450
Uh-huh.

77
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,719
And what do you suppose that means?

78
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:45,723
It means you have
a new master, pirate scum.

79
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:55,734
<i>Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again.</i>

80
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:58,637
<i>As I recall the last time
we met face-to-face,</i>

81
00:06:58,671 --> 00:06:59,873
<i>I was your prisoner.</i>

82
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,940
Uh...

83
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:02,809
<i>And you attempted to barter me off</i>

84
00:07:02,843 --> 00:07:04,344
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

85
00:07:04,378 --> 00:07:05,512
But can you blame me?

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,781
I mean, a Sith Lord.

87
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:09,451
What a handsome price
you would...

88
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:10,786
<i>- Silence!</i>

89
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,789
<i>You are going to pay the price
for your treachery.</i>

90
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:15,458
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

91
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:16,492
Name the price.

92
00:07:16,493 --> 00:07:17,494
I'm sure we can reach...

93
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:19,863
<i>- There will be payment,
but no deals...</i>

94
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,431
<i>only demands.</i>

95
00:07:21,466 --> 00:07:24,334
<i>Your entire arsenal will be melted down.</i>

96
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:27,838
<i>Everything you own is now property</i>

97
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,773
<i>of the Separatist Alliance.</i>

98
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:31,374
Now you go too far!

99
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,976
Unacceptable!

100
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,711
This is an outrage.

101
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,846
This...

102
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Hold on.

103
00:07:36,881 --> 00:07:38,415
We can make a deal.

104
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,519
This is not good business!

105
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:43,855
This isn't good.

106
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:46,659
Those scrappin' droids
are looting the place.

107
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:48,760
They're dismantling our ships.

108
00:07:48,795 --> 00:07:51,563
The fact that Grievous is here
with his entire fleet

109
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,233
means that Master Kenobi
must have been overrun.

110
00:07:54,268 --> 00:07:57,736
This entire system is now
in Separatist controlled space.

111
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,238
What should we do?

112
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:00,439
There's nowhere to run.

113
00:08:00,474 --> 00:08:03,143
You're not running anywhere, skug.

114
00:08:03,177 --> 00:08:05,112
You're still my prisoner.

115
00:08:05,146 --> 00:08:07,781
Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists

116
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:09,817
in exchange for my freedom.

117
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,586
Not likely.

118
00:08:11,621 --> 00:08:13,856
Grievous didn't come here to make deals.

119
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,659
He already controls the planet
and the system.

120
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:18,161
If you hand us over to him,

121
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,298
he'll kill us and then you.

122
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,367
We have a common enemy in Grievous.

123
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,603
Together, we can get out of this.

124
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,705
You must have
some other ships somewhere.

125
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,007
You are pirates.

126
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,310
Hondo's got a private fleet,

127
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,980
but only he knows where the ships are.

128
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:35,249
Then we'll have to rescue him.

129
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:37,016
I know Grievous.

130
00:08:37,051 --> 00:08:38,486
And I know droids.

131
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,189
With my help, you stand a better chance.

132
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:52,568
You got yourself a deal, Jedi.

133
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:10,690
Halt.

134
00:09:12,527 --> 00:09:14,562
You captured this tank?

135
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,597
Not bad for an astromech.

136
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,067
What's your ID number?

137
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:26,542
Hey, do not get smart with me.

138
00:09:26,576 --> 00:09:28,577
I outrank you.

139
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:35,251
You just watch yourself.

140
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:38,220
I could have you melted down
with the rest of this junk.

141
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:40,422
That's right.

142
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:42,860
Now take it over to Hangar 12.

143
00:09:44,195 --> 00:09:45,996
And no detours.

144
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,798
We'll be watching you.

145
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,057
Jedi.

146
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:14,227
And here I thought
you made your escape, no?

147
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:15,595
No.

148
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:17,598
There were complications.

149
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:19,667
Now, we have to put
our differences aside

150
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:20,901
and be friends,

151
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:22,870
or else we're all gonna die here.

152
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,739
Ah, very diplomatic.

153
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:26,908
Ha!

154
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:29,878
I knew you did not come back
to rescue Hondo,

155
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,012
how do you say it?

156
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,315
Out of the goodness of your hearts.

157
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,950
No, no, no, no.

158
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:37,787
You need something from me.

159
00:10:37,822 --> 00:10:39,756
A ship, to be specific.

160
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,024
Ah, yes.

161
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:42,359
A ship, a ship.

162
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:46,097
Ah, but where would we find
one of those?

163
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:49,801
My new friend General Grievous
has destroyed my ships.

164
00:10:49,835 --> 00:10:51,169
We know you have one,

165
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:52,571
a whole pirate fleet.

166
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:56,009
And one of my old friends, apparently,

167
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,111
has been talking too much.

168
00:10:59,581 --> 00:11:01,815
Ah, what does it matter?

169
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,351
We'll never reach the vault anyway.

170
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:05,887
Grievous' army is way too big.

171
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:06,921
Don't give up.

172
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:08,123
We can fight.

173
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:09,557
If I may, sir.

174
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:13,295
I have instructed younglings
for over 1,000 generations,

175
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,098
and these are among the best
I have ever seen.

176
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,668
Well, then, show me.

177
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:22,406
Show me your swords, tiny Jedi.

178
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,843
Show Hondo you are ready to fight.

179
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:28,846
Ah.

180
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,115
And you, child.

181
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,984
Where is your saber?

182
00:11:32,018 --> 00:11:33,686
It's not finished.

183
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,988
I never finished it.

184
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,556
I've done everything right,

185
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,890
but it won't work.

186
00:11:37,925 --> 00:11:39,125
You must trust

187
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,528
that the components
that form your lightsaber

188
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:43,563
are meant to be together.

189
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:45,164
There is no other way.

190
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:47,801
It is the Force that binds them.

191
00:11:47,836 --> 00:11:49,370
Yes, I was just going to say that.

192
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:50,404
Finish it now.

193
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,572
Finish, finish!

194
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:54,542
This is worth the price of a ship.

195
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:57,579
To see the construction
of a Jedi lightsaber,

196
00:11:57,614 --> 00:12:00,482
this... this is priceless.

197
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:01,617
Finish it,

198
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:04,786
and together, we can defeat Grievous.

199
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,729
Oh.

200
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:14,998
Amazing.

201
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:21,137
That is truly amazing.

202
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:31,547
Well, cut me down, little Jedi.

203
00:12:31,581 --> 00:12:32,816
It's time to leave.

204
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,194
So why the big show?

205
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,163
You didn't really have a choice.

206
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,031
You know we have to work together.

207
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,900
Because, Jedi,

208
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,539
you know what we are about to
attempt is very dangerous.

209
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,474
And I may be a pirate,

210
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:59,479
but I do not like
taking children into battle.

211
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,982
That didn't seem to bother you
when you attacked us.

212
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,819
Well, today is a new day,

213
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:07,921
and lucky for you, today,

214
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,423
I like children.

215
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:11,258
Now, let's free the rest of my men.

216
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,136
<i>This is OOM-87, General.</i>

217
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,272
<i>The prison area is under attack.</i>

218
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:40,841
<i>There are several miniature Jedi here.</i>

219
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,142
What?

220
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:44,077
You aren't making any sense.

221
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,280
What Jedi?

222
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:46,448
<i>The little ones,</i>

223
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,149
<i>half the size of normal Jedi.</i>

224
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:49,618
<i>They're freeing the prisoners
and...</i>

225
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:50,719
<i>my knees!</i>

226
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,058
Prepare to open fire.

227
00:13:56,092 --> 00:13:58,861
We will bring the building down
on their heads.

228
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,518
I got your back.

229
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:50,786
Great.

230
00:14:50,821 --> 00:14:52,021
I feel so safe.

231
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:11,476
They run.

232
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,510
Quickly.

233
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:13,511
After them.

234
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,127
They went the wrong way.

235
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:59,763
Don't worry.

236
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:24,690
What about the others?

237
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,426
We can't just leave them.

238
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,896
You are welcome to come, small one.

239
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,931
You may join our merry band of pirates.

240
00:16:31,966 --> 00:16:33,866
I won't just run away.

241
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,970
Ahsoka trusted you.

242
00:16:36,004 --> 00:16:37,338
We all trusted you.

243
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:51,387
R2, do something.

244
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:53,455
I don't know.

245
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,991
We have to shake Grievous off.

246
00:16:55,026 --> 00:16:56,827
Get aggressive.
Ah!

247
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,180
Too aggressive.

248
00:17:14,214 --> 00:17:15,949
Far too aggressive.

249
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,762
Yes, well, it was an effective strategy,

250
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,831
but not what I would recommend.

251
00:17:53,194 --> 00:17:57,097
So many lightsabers
to add to my collection.

252
00:18:08,944 --> 00:18:09,944
Hurry!

253
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:10,978
Come on!

254
00:18:10,979 --> 00:18:12,379
Run.

255
00:18:12,414 --> 00:18:14,081
All of you run!

256
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:48,520
Ha!

257
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:08,508
Ahsoka!

258
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,510
Come on!

259
00:19:09,511 --> 00:19:10,911
Ahsoka, come on!

260
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:20,054
You will never defeat Grievous.

261
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,756
Never!

262
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,558
I wouldn't be so sure.

263
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:30,864
Did we get him?

264
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:31,898
I can't tell.

265
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,608
Show is over, kiddies.

266
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:40,876
Let's get out of here.

267
00:20:07,876 --> 00:20:09,576
And let me see.

268
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,211
Oh, the cost of the fuel.

269
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,448
I had to use a lot of fuel.

270
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:16,951
The general wear and tear
on my men and equipment.

271
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:19,954
A couple of them died, I think.

272
00:20:19,989 --> 00:20:21,390
Believe me, Kenobi.

273
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:26,262
Staging a rescue is not
an inexpensive proposition.

274
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:29,365
So you mean to tell me
you were staging a rescue,

275
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:32,603
not attempting to hijack
a Jedi starship?

276
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:34,138
You're welcome!

277
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:36,273
Oh, the thanklessness!

278
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:37,741
What an accusation.

279
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:38,776
I am gone!

280
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,512
I will send you my bill!

281
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,202
Ahsoka.

282
00:21:03,236 --> 00:21:04,670
It's good to see you're all safe.

283
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,173
Yes, Master.

284
00:21:06,207 --> 00:21:08,442
We had quite an eventful mission.

285
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,378
The most eventful since the time

286
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:14,081
Master Yoda went to find
his lightsaber crystal.

287
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:15,115
What?

288
00:21:15,117 --> 00:21:16,117
Oh!

289
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:17,552
- Tell us!
- What happened then?

290
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:21,155
I'm afraid that story will have to wait.

291
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:22,757
For now, be proud.

292
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,294
You have survived an ordeal
few your age could.

293
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,632
Welcome home, young Jedi.

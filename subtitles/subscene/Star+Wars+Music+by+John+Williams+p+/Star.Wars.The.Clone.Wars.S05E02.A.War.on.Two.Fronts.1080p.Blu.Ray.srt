1
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,680
<i>Separatist takeover complete.</i>

2
00:00:20,747 --> 00:00:23,249
<i>Another Republic planet has fallen.</i>

3
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,584
<i>Onderon has seceded</i>

4
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,186
<i>to the Confederacy
of Independent Systems</i>

5
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,455
<i>under the rule of a new king.</i>

6
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:32,291
<i>However, a small band of rebels
have taken refuge</i>

7
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,527
<i>deep within its vast
and savage wilderness.</i>

8
00:00:35,595 --> 00:00:38,264
<i>From an abandoned outpost,
they plot to take back</i>

9
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:40,733
<i>the heavily fortified
capital city of Iziz</i>

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,469
<i>and end the Separatist occupation.</i>

11
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:49,175
<i>Unfortunately,
the only way to reclaim Onderon</i>

12
00:00:49,243 --> 00:00:51,010
<i>will be through armed struggle.</i>

13
00:00:51,078 --> 00:00:53,580
<i>But we lack sufficient
hardware and supplies.</i>

14
00:00:53,647 --> 00:00:55,581
Onderon is in your king's rule.

15
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,917
And at the outbreak of the Clone War,

16
00:00:57,985 --> 00:01:00,187
he chose to align it
with the Separatists.

17
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:02,222
<i>Our true king has been silenced.</i>

18
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,923
<i>The one you recognize is a traitor</i>

19
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,226
<i>and a Separatist minion.</i>

20
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:08,294
<i>We need your help to survive this.</i>

21
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:11,731
Find a way we shall.

22
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,767
<i>We await your answer.</i>

23
00:01:18,974 --> 00:01:21,014
There are pockets of rebels
on many of these planets

24
00:01:21,076 --> 00:01:22,509
that just need guidance.

25
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:25,278
With training and resources,

26
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:27,314
they could attack soft targets
while the Republic

27
00:01:27,382 --> 00:01:29,549
continues to engage them
on the battlefield.

28
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:32,252
That sounds like terrorism, Anakin.

29
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,920
Well, I think of it as an insurgency

30
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:36,923
to help realign these planets
with the Republic.

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,925
We can divide the Separatist forces

32
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:41,528
and press them on two fronts.

33
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:44,964
A means to an end fear cannot be.

34
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:49,068
Stop those who spread terror
the Jedi must.

35
00:01:49,136 --> 00:01:50,136
Indeed.

36
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:51,337
What you're suggesting

37
00:01:51,405 --> 00:01:53,106
would open up dangerous possibilities.

38
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:55,275
And we must not train terrorists.

39
00:01:55,343 --> 00:01:56,910
Eh, rebels.

40
00:01:56,977 --> 00:01:58,144
How we conduct war

41
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:00,356
is what distinguishes us from others.

42
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:03,015
Funding rebels to overthrow
a legitimate government

43
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,918
puts innocent lives at risk.

44
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,420
We can minimize collateral damage

45
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,956
by using arms
that mainly affect droids.

46
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,792
The least we can do
is help them defend themselves,

47
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:14,027
test the tactic while we're at it.

48
00:02:15,296 --> 00:02:17,331
This could be
a great new weapon for us.

49
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,503
Hmm.

50
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:24,705
Train and observe.

51
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:26,941
Send advisors we will.

52
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,542
I'll assemble a team.

53
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,811
I'm going with you.

54
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,914
What, you don't trust me?

55
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:34,182
Too much.

56
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,251
That's what worries me.

57
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:51,798
This is Valkyrie 2929.

58
00:02:51,865 --> 00:02:53,466
We're coming up on the drop zone.

59
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,440
Go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,502
We've spotted them, sir.

61
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:40,681
Stay where you are.

62
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:47,154
Identify yourselves.

63
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,694
It's all right.
We're friends.

64
00:03:52,761 --> 00:03:54,495
Jedi.

65
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm Commander Tano.

66
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,069
We're here to help you
take back your planet.

67
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,205
My name is Steela.

68
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:06,941
I'll guide you to our secret base.

69
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,409
Hmm.

70
00:05:18,477 --> 00:05:21,211
A bit rough around the edges,
wouldn't you say?

71
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,013
That's why I brought Rex here.

72
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,115
They're not exactly
what I would call shinies, sir,

73
00:05:25,183 --> 00:05:27,184
but I could work with them.

74
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:47,836
General Skywalker.

75
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,537
At your service.

76
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:51,339
This is General Kenobi,

77
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,109
Commander Tano, and Captain Rex.

78
00:05:54,177 --> 00:05:56,045
We're looking forward
to taking the fight

79
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:57,913
to those scrappin' droids.

80
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,816
Yes.
All in good time.

81
00:06:00,884 --> 00:06:02,151
Saw.

82
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,686
Saw Gerrera.

83
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,822
He fashions himself as our leader,

84
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,992
though no one elected him.

85
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,162
Well, for now, we're in charge,

86
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:13,197
and there is much to learn.

87
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,839
The Separatists
have strength in numbers.

88
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:23,975
We're gonna show you
how to target and destroy them.

89
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:25,043
Now, to be clear,

90
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:27,012
we are not here to fight your war;

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,814
rather, to show you how to conduct it

92
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,850
in the most efficient
and successful way possible.

93
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,888
Captain Rex.

94
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:40,659
I'll show you
how the 501st destroy clankers.

95
00:06:40,727 --> 00:06:42,728
First, I need volunteers
to carry supplies

96
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:45,498
from our entry point
a half-klick west.

97
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:47,367
Shouldn't be a problem.

98
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,768
Excellent.

99
00:06:51,072 --> 00:06:54,274
Lux, it's good to see you again.

100
00:06:54,342 --> 00:06:56,477
It's good to see you too, Ahsoka.

101
00:06:56,545 --> 00:06:59,581
I didn't realize you had
such strong ties to Onderon.

102
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:01,349
Onderon is my home.

103
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,818
My mother represented it
in the Senate.

104
00:07:03,886 --> 00:07:07,488
Your voice is strong, like hers was.

105
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,525
Have you reconsidered
joining the Republic Senate?

106
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,794
Even if we do take back Onderon,

107
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,695
it won't change how I feel.

108
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,664
I'm not fighting for the Republic.

109
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:19,133
Well, what matters now is,
we need each other's help,

110
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:21,335
just like we did on Carlac.

111
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:23,303
Carlac?

112
00:07:23,371 --> 00:07:25,973
What happened on Carlac?

113
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,576
Ahsoka is the reason I'm here
and not with Death Watch.

114
00:07:29,644 --> 00:07:31,077
Really?

115
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:32,645
What he means is...

116
00:07:32,713 --> 00:07:35,415
She saved me from a huge mistake.

117
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,186
Hmm.

118
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:42,521
Lux obviously thinks highly of you.

119
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:43,722
I guess so.

120
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,825
Let's hope that respect
is well founded.

121
00:07:50,564 --> 00:07:52,884
The pilot in the front hatch
controls the tank,

122
00:07:53,004 --> 00:07:55,340
the shelves and the short range blasters.

123
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,195
The commander in the top hatch
controls the turret

124
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:58,996
and the main cannon.

125
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:00,865
You have to take out both chambers.

126
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:03,768
Otherwise, the tank
will remain operational.

127
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:21,987
Everyone, divide up into teams of two,

128
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:25,224
and we'll practice an assault
on both hatches.

129
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:27,827
I'll take the top.

130
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,964
Let's see what you're
made of, Bonteri.

131
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,242
Ah!

132
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,612
Sorry about that.

133
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,649
You're a terrible soldier, Bonteri.

134
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:51,818
I'm not sure
if they're more interested

135
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,887
in fighting the droids or each other.

136
00:08:53,954 --> 00:08:55,121
They'll learn.

137
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,457
We just need time
to train them properly.

138
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:59,425
Keep your eyes on the quick learners.

139
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:02,161
In this fight,
time is not on our side.

140
00:09:02,229 --> 00:09:04,064
Go, go, go, go, go!

141
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,958
An unscheduled ship
entered the atmosphere

142
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:32,192
in sector S-11

143
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,294
and failed to register.

144
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:37,297
The rebels may be operating
in that area.

145
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:39,366
Check it out.

146
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,472
Come on!

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,508
Move it like a soldier,
like a real soldier!

148
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:51,444
Come on, Dono.
Pick it up, Hutch.

149
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,977
You can do better than that.

150
00:09:53,045 --> 00:09:54,412
Come on, hustle!

151
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,980
I said hustle!

152
00:09:56,048 --> 00:09:57,688
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

153
00:09:57,716 --> 00:09:58,883
Go, go, go!

154
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,951
Good, good.

155
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:01,186
You sure you're up for this?

156
00:10:01,254 --> 00:10:03,088
- Saw.
- It was an accident.

157
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:06,959
You would've had us both killed.

158
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,328
Just stop it.

159
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:10,796
Sit down, boy.

160
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,131
This isn't the Senate.

161
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,033
You've got no talent for this.

162
00:10:14,101 --> 00:10:15,702
It's going to take
a lot more than muscle

163
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,670
to defeat the Separatists.

164
00:10:17,738 --> 00:10:21,006
Politics have failed us.
We have no choice.

165
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:22,941
We always have a choice.

166
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,344
Then make yours.

167
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,246
Look, if we're going to succeed,

168
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:30,450
you'll need to be exceptional
with words and action.

169
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,485
There will be time for both.

170
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,494
Destroyers are quick,
pack twin blasters,

171
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,395
and come with their own
shield generators.

172
00:10:43,463 --> 00:10:46,365
Nothing short of a cannon
will pierce it.

173
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:48,734
But they do have two weaknesses,

174
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,871
and you will need to work
together to exploit them.

175
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,175
Beep!

176
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:57,677
The shields deflect
high-velocity attacks.

177
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:06,386
What the shields don't stop
are slow or stationary objects.

178
00:11:06,453 --> 00:11:07,620
They're designed to absorb them

179
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:10,423
so nothing hinders their movement.

180
00:11:17,363 --> 00:11:19,865
Destroyers are blind from behind.

181
00:11:19,933 --> 00:11:22,134
A distraction combined
with a rear assault

182
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:23,635
will give you a kill.

183
00:11:23,703 --> 00:11:26,705
The trick is to get the right
speed on the droid popper.

184
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,774
Beep!

185
00:11:29,843 --> 00:11:31,010
These are unarmed.

186
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:34,314
Just concentrate on getting it
past the shield.

187
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,417
Watch and learn.

188
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:44,457
Quite brilliant.

189
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:57,104
Hmm.
Nice touch.

190
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:59,172
Thanks.

191
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:03,076
Not bad.

192
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:13,887
Ugh!

193
00:12:13,955 --> 00:12:15,956
Be mindful of your frustration.

194
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:17,824
It'll only hold you back.

195
00:12:17,892 --> 00:12:19,026
Here.

196
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,228
Use your shoulder, let your arm swing,

197
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,930
and keep your eyes on the target.

198
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:28,035
Great.

199
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:29,770
Okay, let's get back to work.

200
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,171
Everyone pair up.

201
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:33,207
We'll practice in groups.

202
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:42,015
Hey, Commander,
how about helping me practice?

203
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:02,474
Roger, roger.
This is command.

204
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:07,179
Copy that.
I'll send a squad out now.

205
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,648
We've located the rebels.

206
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:11,017
Proceed to sector S-29.

207
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:13,052
Shoot to kill.

208
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:35,953
I can't get the distance
or the speed right.

209
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,422
Don't give up.

210
00:13:37,489 --> 00:13:41,626
Learning this could save your
life and those around you.

211
00:13:41,694 --> 00:13:45,397
A little backspin might help.

212
00:13:45,464 --> 00:13:47,032
Just take it easy.

213
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,101
Don't get frustrated.

214
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:57,277
You got it.

215
00:13:57,344 --> 00:13:59,479
You're a good teacher, Jedi.

216
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,115
Ugh, just forget it.

217
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:03,150
I'll never learn this.

218
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:08,489
Uh, keep practicing.

219
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,402
You made it look easy.

220
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,938
It wasn't always that way.

221
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,573
Right.
The Force.

222
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:26,674
That your secret?

223
00:14:26,742 --> 00:14:29,844
No.
Perseverance.

224
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,713
Look, you'll get the hang of it.

225
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,447
I wouldn't let it get you down.

226
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:36,784
I'm not feeling down.

227
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,853
I just know what I'm good at.

228
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,340
Impressive.

229
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:00,442
Most impressive.

230
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,211
Fixed targets are one thing.

231
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,279
How about this?

232
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,892
Nice job.

233
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:21,932
You have clearly mastered
your ability to focus.

234
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:27,005
Snips, are you losing focus?

235
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:29,407
- No, Master.
- Good.

236
00:15:29,474 --> 00:15:30,608
A headshot

237
00:15:30,676 --> 00:15:33,511
is the only decisive way
to disable a droid.

238
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,479
They don't need arms, legs,
or even bodies

239
00:15:35,547 --> 00:15:37,948
to pass intel to central command.

240
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:40,017
All right, shoot at will.

241
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,456
Wait a minute.
What is that?

242
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,760
Droids!

243
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:53,565
Take cover!

244
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:07,746
It appears the training is over.

245
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:21,159
I'll take the left flank
if you take the right.

246
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:24,195
No, Anakin.
We can only protect them.

247
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:26,497
We cannot fight this war for them.

248
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:31,902
There are too many.

249
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,205
But Anakin, Ahsoka, and I
can hold them off

250
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,939
while you get your people out of here.

251
00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:40,110
You didn't teach us to run.

252
00:16:40,177 --> 00:16:42,779
Saw, use your disruptors
to take out the droids.

253
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:44,047
I'm on it.

254
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:45,215
Ready disruptors.

255
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:47,884
On my mark.

256
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:50,520
Now!

257
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,856
What is that?

258
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:54,358
It looks like an explosive.

259
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:55,425
How can you te...

260
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:57,828
Not bad.

261
00:16:57,896 --> 00:17:00,030
That is only the first wave.

262
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,577
We'll handle this.

263
00:17:13,645 --> 00:17:15,679
No, I will.

264
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:16,981
Duck!

265
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,000
Ah!

266
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:40,071
Hey, Bonteri, you ready to try again?

267
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:43,908
Hey, what are you doing?

268
00:17:43,976 --> 00:17:46,010
What you taught us.

269
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,216
Clang!

270
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,218
Surrender, rebel.
Uh...

271
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:59,056
You will answer for your crimes
against the Separatist Alliance.

272
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,404
We, uh, need to clean you up.

273
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,039
I like it.

274
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:19,909
Now you look more like a soldier
than a politician.

275
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:23,812
Well, maybe a good politician
needs to get dirty now and then.

276
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,387
Take confidence from this victory.

277
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:36,724
But rest assured,
there will be more droids coming

278
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,826
now that they know your position.

279
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:41,228
It doesn't matter.
You're ready now.

280
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,864
We are going to take the fight
to the droids.

281
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,200
You don't have to hide
in the jungle any longer.

282
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:49,736
Droids were a bit dim,
more so than I imagined.

283
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,705
They make up for it in numbers.

284
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:53,440
They're designed to overwhelm.

285
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,643
But they're not designed
to deal with our approach.

286
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,745
We hit them
where they least expect it.

287
00:18:58,813 --> 00:19:00,413
And before they realize
what happened...

288
00:19:00,481 --> 00:19:02,683
We fade in
with the rest of the population.

289
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,318
Exactly.

290
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,154
We need a plan to get inside the city.

291
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:09,824
I have an idea.

292
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,217
Identification please.

293
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,024
Halt.

294
00:19:44,092 --> 00:19:47,528
What were you doing
outside of the city gates?

295
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:48,595
Hunting.

296
00:19:48,596 --> 00:19:50,264
We've been trekking for days.

297
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:55,202
Did you register
before your excursion?

298
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:57,604
No, but most of our time
is spent in the bush,

299
00:19:57,672 --> 00:19:59,206
collecting our traps.

300
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:01,475
We come to the city to sell.

301
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:04,578
You can't get thrip larva
like this in Iziz.

302
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:07,314
Only the biggest trees
on the other side of Onderon.

303
00:20:07,382 --> 00:20:08,682
Hey, listen,

304
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,452
we need to deliver all of this
in time for supper.

305
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,619
Hmm.

306
00:20:12,687 --> 00:20:14,221
Are you scanning anything?

307
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:18,325
It's hard to tell
with so much organic matter.

308
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:19,426
Come on!

309
00:20:19,494 --> 00:20:21,328
Our merchants are waiting inside.

310
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:23,830
Can you hurry it up?

311
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,565
Let them through.

312
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,634
Roger, roger.

313
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,111
Good plan.

314
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,279
Like Saw said,

315
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,982
those droids are dumber
than we thought.

316
00:20:50,358 --> 00:20:51,525
Not a bad start.

317
00:20:51,593 --> 00:20:54,328
But now the hard work begins.

318
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:57,464
You must find recruits
and choose your targets wisely.

319
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:59,400
They'll be looking for us.

320
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,902
We should split up.

321
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,170
Regroup after nightfall.

322
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:04,205
I'll alert our brothers.

323
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,644
We'll make sure you have
the supplies you need.

324
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:12,713
Rex and I will take care of that.

325
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,847
Good luck.

326
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:15,916
You too.

327
00:21:28,696 --> 00:21:31,598
How do you think they'll do?

328
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,068
I have a feeling
we'll be pleasantly surprised.

329
00:21:35,136 --> 00:21:37,904
So you admit our new strategy
will work?

330
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:41,742
I am hopeful, Anakin, hopeful.

1
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,519
<i>Villainy swells!</i>

2
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,330
<i>With an army of the galaxy's
most vicious criminals,</i>

3
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:25,673
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress</i>

4
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:28,519
<i>conspire with Pre Vizsla
and the Death Watch</i>

5
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:32,033
<i>to topple Duchess Satine,
ruler of Mandalore.</i>

6
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,075
<i>While the conspirators prepare to attack</i>

7
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,151
<i>the Mandalorian capital of Sundari</i>

8
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:37,824
<i>from a base on Zanbar,</i>

9
00:00:37,858 --> 00:00:41,674
<i>the fate of 2,000 other neutral
systems is under threat</i>

10
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,519
<i>as Darth Maul moves closer
to establishing</i>

11
00:00:44,554 --> 00:00:46,997
<i>a vast criminal empire.</i>

12
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:49,006
Where are my targets?

13
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:51,283
We've identified them
at these locations.

14
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:53,258
However, as I've said before,

15
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:56,138
if we try to take Mandalore by force,

16
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:58,950
our people will turn against us.

17
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:01,126
I will use

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,369
my army of crime lords

19
00:01:03,403 --> 00:01:06,047
to attack different targets
across Sundari

20
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:10,198
and sow chaos to undermine
the Duchess' rule.

21
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:15,622
Our gangsters will make her look
too weak to maintain control.

22
00:01:15,657 --> 00:01:18,735
Then you and your Death Watch
will capture and arrest us,

23
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:23,020
bringing order where Satine's
weak government could not.

24
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:25,029
We'll be saviors.

25
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:26,871
Exactly.

26
00:01:26,905 --> 00:01:28,477
A good plan.

27
00:01:28,512 --> 00:01:29,512
Indeed.

28
00:01:29,516 --> 00:01:31,189
I'll prepare the troops.

29
00:01:39,894 --> 00:01:42,638
It's a risk to trust those monsters.

30
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:44,880
How do we know they'll keep
their end of the bargain?

31
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,655
We need those Sith and their thugs

32
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,668
to cause some pain and show
the Mandalorian people

33
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,843
how weak Satine really is.

34
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,250
After this is done,

35
00:01:53,284 --> 00:01:55,927
no one will doubt why we're in power.

36
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:57,735
Most will welcome us.

37
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,940
Then what?

38
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:01,618
Then we execute Maul and those thugs.

39
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:04,999
Those criminals will scatter,
and Mandalore will be ours.

40
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:13,502
I believe Vizsla will betray us.

41
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:15,879
We have no other choice.

42
00:02:15,913 --> 00:02:17,385
We cannot rule openly

43
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,097
without drawing the attention
of the Jedi.

44
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,579
We need Vizsla as the face of our rule

45
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:24,716
for now.

46
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,457
The promise of wealth

47
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,967
will find us a new face on Mandalore.

48
00:02:29,002 --> 00:02:32,315
You have learned well, my apprentice.

49
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,863
Greed never fails to motivate.

50
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:03,046
What's the matter?

51
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,222
I am scanning life forms.

52
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:08,402
I believe this spice shipment
is infested.

53
00:03:08,437 --> 00:03:10,277
Step back.

54
00:03:10,312 --> 00:03:12,152
Ah!

55
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,190
Gangsters!

56
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,399
We're under attack.

57
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:20,183
Surrender.

58
00:03:20,187 --> 00:03:22,697
My Master is taking over these docks.

59
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:26,246
You are now under the control
of the Pyke Syndicate.

60
00:03:29,495 --> 00:03:32,306
Duchess, the shipping docks
are under attack.

61
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:34,281
By whom?
The Death Watch?

62
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:37,328
No, it appears to be a crime syndicate.

63
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:39,905
Our guards are helpless
against their numbers,

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,521
and the people are demanding
we do something to stop them.

65
00:03:46,502 --> 00:03:48,141
Welcome to Mandalore.

66
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,661
Stand down.

67
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:55,841
You are now all slaves
of the Black Sun Clan.

68
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,991
Fall back!

69
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:05,951
It's the gangsters.

70
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:07,190
Lock the vaults.

71
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,763
Open the bank.

72
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,040
We're here for a withdrawal.

73
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,278
Guards, now.

74
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,209
The Black Sun is attacking the vaults.

75
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:20,916
Send reinforcements.

76
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,731
Take him.

77
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:47,867
I need you all to remain calm.

78
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:50,579
These attackers are just thugs

79
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:53,156
brought on by the lowest element.

80
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:57,374
The Duchess Satine has led us to ruin.

81
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,525
Death Watch.

82
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,198
Guards, stay back.

83
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:07,382
Vizsla, you must be the one
responsible for these attacks.

84
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,391
No, I'm not responsible.

85
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:11,935
But I can offer a solution.

86
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,923
People of Mandalore...

87
00:05:18,832 --> 00:05:22,079
I am Pre Vizsla of clan Vizsla.

88
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,752
Death Watch is here to save you

89
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:25,594
from these intergalactic gangsters

90
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,603
that threaten our great city.

91
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,344
This is a war,

92
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:31,185
and we will win.

93
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:41,496
Join me and let us defend
Mandalore against the criminals.

94
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,509
We need action, not pacifism.

95
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,685
Do not listen to him!

96
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,736
His war will cause the end
of Mandalore as we know it.

97
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,745
We are under attack.

98
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,355
There is no time for discussion.

99
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:03,858
The name Mandalore should send fear

100
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:07,541
into the hearts of these gangsters.

101
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,047
It's war!

102
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,387
It's war!

103
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,898
Vizsla! Vizsla!

104
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,271
War!

105
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,165
The people are beginning to follow you.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,814
It is time for Death Watch
to take action.

107
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,593
Make sure you put on a good show.

108
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:39,405
As you wish, Lord Maul.

109
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:56,144
What should we do?

110
00:06:56,178 --> 00:06:57,817
There's nothing we can do.

111
00:06:57,851 --> 00:07:00,193
The Duchess' forces are being overrun

112
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:02,168
across the entire planet.

113
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:03,843
Listen.

114
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:07,525
It sounds like there is fighting
going on out there.

115
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:08,562
Ah!

116
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:11,978
What's going on?

117
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:13,016
We're Death Watch,

118
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,024
and we're here to rescue you.

119
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,899
You have my thanks, soldier.

120
00:07:16,933 --> 00:07:19,711
No, thank Pre Vizsla.

121
00:07:55,897 --> 00:07:57,737
You're safe now.

122
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,717
It's the Death Watch.

123
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,090
The Death Watch are our saviors.

124
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:03,295
- They saved us.
- They freed us.

125
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:04,332
Our saviors.

126
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,872
The Death Watch saved us.

127
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,329
Stop them!
They've robbed the main vault.

128
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,415
Keep up, you weaklings.

129
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,487
Ugh.

130
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:45,411
This monster will not trouble

131
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:48,023
the people of Mandalore any longer.

132
00:08:48,057 --> 00:08:50,132
Take him away, Captain.

133
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,249
Vizsla!

134
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,420
Vizsla!

135
00:08:55,456 --> 00:08:57,697
Vizsla! Vizsla!

136
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:04,525
Duchess, Pre Vizsla and his
men have entered the palace.

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,697
Should we stop them?

138
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,203
How can we?

139
00:09:07,237 --> 00:09:09,446
The people are on their side now.

140
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,626
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

141
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:16,878
No!

142
00:09:16,912 --> 00:09:19,321
There will be no bloodshed.

143
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:20,661
But, Duchess...

144
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:24,544
- I will not be provoked
to violence by these terrorists.

145
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:26,051
Listen, Duchess.

146
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:27,725
Do you hear the people?

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,236
They cry out for change.

148
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:33,752
Your weak-minded rule
of Mandalore is at an end.

149
00:09:33,787 --> 00:09:36,765
The resurrection of our warrior past

150
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,442
is about to begin.

151
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,552
Duchess Satine
and the New Mandalorian leaders

152
00:09:49,587 --> 00:09:51,560
have fled in cowardice

153
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:55,142
while the Death Watch brought
these criminals to justice.

154
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,988
Your new Prime Minister, Pre Vizsla,

155
00:09:58,023 --> 00:09:59,829
leader of Death Watch,

156
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,005
exiled governor of Concordia,

157
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,247
true son of Mandalore,

158
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:05,687
presents you with the lords

159
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,699
of the most feared crime
families in the galaxy.

160
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:09,734
Vizsla!

161
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,845
Vizsla! Vizsla!

162
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,695
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

163
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,235
Vizsla!

164
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,869
You cannot hold me here.

165
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:27,213
I am the Duchess of Mandalore.

166
00:10:27,248 --> 00:10:30,393
Your actions will bring
our civilization to ruin.

167
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:32,202
Is that you, Satine?

168
00:10:32,236 --> 00:10:33,474
Almec?

169
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,115
Here for a visit,

170
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:37,893
or has peace betrayed you too, Duchess?

171
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,174
Peace exists only in the minds
of the faithful.

172
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,923
And faith has been
the greatest disappointment.

173
00:10:44,957 --> 00:10:47,099
Only when it is broken.

174
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,945
What you did for the people
as Prime Minister

175
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,920
betrayed their trust.

176
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,427
And you betrayed mine.

177
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,106
Destitution leaves little room
for faith.

178
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,655
My actions allowed the people
hope in your leadership.

179
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,404
The supplies I bought on the
black market kept you in power.

180
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:06,115
Another error of judgment.

181
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,830
The people made willing
sacrifices for their freedom.

182
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:12,006
Corruption is not the answer.

183
00:11:13,982 --> 00:11:16,358
Then enjoy your freedom, Duchess.

184
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:19,872
You'll have plenty of time
to tell me all about it.

185
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,289
The transition of power
will be seamless.

186
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,030
We now have the support of the people

187
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:35,206
and Satine to bait Kenobi.

188
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,219
With his demise,
our deal will be complete.

189
00:11:38,253 --> 00:11:40,730
Your oversight requires correction.

190
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:43,911
We now have a base, an army,

191
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:47,827
and the means to expand
to other neutral systems.

192
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:49,903
It wasn't an oversight.

193
00:11:49,938 --> 00:11:51,477
It was intentional.

194
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:54,323
I don't have an interest
in the other systems.

195
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,701
Your vision no longer matters.

196
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,601
Oh, don't fret.

197
00:12:04,635 --> 00:12:06,341
I'll still honor our deal.

198
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:08,217
Kenobi will be dealt with.

199
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:11,798
But now you'll do as I say.

200
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:16,987
The violence is over!

201
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:19,999
The last of the parasites
infecting Mandalore

202
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:21,673
has been caught.

203
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,849
The Duchess has abandoned her duty

204
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:25,690
to protect Mandalore.

205
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,569
Her political dream
only encourages aggression

206
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:29,740
against our planet.

207
00:12:31,114 --> 00:12:32,854
We have learned from this beast

208
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:36,202
the consequences of pacifist principles.

209
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:40,754
It's now time to restore
the traditions of Mandalore.

210
00:12:40,788 --> 00:12:43,767
No one will ever threaten us again!

211
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:46,277
Vizsla! Vizsla!

212
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:49,592
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

213
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:00,521
Vizsla has captured
the support of his people,

214
00:13:00,556 --> 00:13:02,028
just as we planned.

215
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:05,644
However, he is not
their anointed leader yet.

216
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,485
There is still time for us

217
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,402
to put in place a leader
under our control.

218
00:13:11,436 --> 00:13:13,912
Then let us escape,
and we shall find one.

219
00:13:13,946 --> 00:13:15,586
Patience.

220
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,527
We must move cautiously.

221
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,167
By placing us in prison,

222
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:22,013
Vizsla has unwittingly put us in reach

223
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,326
of several candidates for his successor.

224
00:13:25,361 --> 00:13:28,138
Who do you mean, brother?

225
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,820
Vizsla has imprisoned the Duchess here.

226
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:35,670
Other political advisors of hers
will be within these walls

227
00:13:35,704 --> 00:13:38,683
who will suit our purposes well.

228
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,094
Hey, quiet, you two.

229
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:45,380
Apprentice,
I wish a tour of this facility.

230
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:49,997
Ah!

231
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,004
Zap!

232
00:14:00,212 --> 00:14:01,382
Crash!

233
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,304
You are the now the former
Duchess Satine,

234
00:14:14,338 --> 00:14:16,379
are you not?

235
00:14:16,414 --> 00:14:19,224
What do you want, you monster?

236
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,430
Mm, nothing yet,

237
00:14:20,464 --> 00:14:22,773
but I will have a use for you in time.

238
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,719
Where are the other leaders
of your people?

239
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,727
You should know already.

240
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:29,903
They've either sided with Vizsla

241
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:31,578
or have been killed.

242
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,490
There's no one left now but Almec and I,

243
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,302
but he's as corrupt and vile as you.

244
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:38,574
Really?

245
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:39,644
Hmm.

246
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,457
Thank you for being so cooperative.

247
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,532
Almec?

248
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:54,273
Yes?

249
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,951
I can deliver you from this prison.

250
00:14:56,986 --> 00:14:59,630
What was your position
in this government?

251
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:02,275
I am the former Prime Minister.

252
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:05,891
Satine imprisoned me on charges
of corruption and conspiracy

253
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:08,737
for using the black market.

254
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,344
He's a murderer.

255
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,521
He caused the death of children.

256
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:13,592
Quiet.

257
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,568
What do you want from me?

258
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:27,484
Mandalore is in need
of a Prime Minister.

259
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,229
I thought you were in league
with Pre Vizsla.

260
00:15:34,749 --> 00:15:36,757
We were.

261
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:38,431
Clearly you are powerful,

262
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:42,214
but how can two of you overthrow
Vizsla and his supporters?

263
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:44,557
Vizsla is a soldier,

264
00:15:44,591 --> 00:15:45,997
and like every soldier,

265
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:48,507
he is bound by honor.

266
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,449
I will challenge him to single combat

267
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:51,621
in front of his men.

268
00:15:51,656 --> 00:15:54,433
He will not deny me.

269
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:55,468
Hmm.

270
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:56,642
If you defeat him,

271
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:59,488
according to the ancient laws
of Mandalore,

272
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:02,870
his soldiers will be honor-bound
to follow you.

273
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,745
Precisely.

274
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,732
<i>Sir, they're attacking.</i>

275
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,231
I challenge you,

276
00:16:25,265 --> 00:16:27,407
one warrior to another.

277
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:31,625
And only the strongest
shall rule Mandalore.

278
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,985
So be it.

279
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,028
Give him his weapon.

280
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,440
For Mandalore!

281
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,620
Ah!

282
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:39,709
Crack!

283
00:18:55,814 --> 00:18:56,818
Ah!

284
00:18:57,823 --> 00:18:59,663
Oh.

285
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,643
Like you said,

286
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:13,053
only the strongest

287
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,865
shall rule.

288
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:23,396
I claim this sword

289
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:26,409
and my rightful place as leader

290
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,619
of Death Watch.

291
00:19:32,068 --> 00:19:33,206
Never.

292
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,581
No outsider will ever rule Mandalore.

293
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:36,854
Hmm.

294
00:19:36,889 --> 00:19:38,729
If you'll not join me,

295
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:41,340
you will all die.

296
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,022
You're all traitors.

297
00:19:45,057 --> 00:19:47,365
Unfortunately for you,

298
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,875
history will not see it that way.

299
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:51,483
Execute them!

300
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:24,659
Silence, please, silence.

301
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,970
Hear me now.

302
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:28,643
Duchess Satine,

303
00:20:28,678 --> 00:20:31,825
the so-called pacifist,

304
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:35,507
who could not protect you
when your lives were at stake,

305
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,018
has murdered Pre Vizsla,

306
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,328
the true hero of Mandalore.

307
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:43,340
Satine is now under arrest,

308
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:45,884
and it was Pre Vizsla's last command

309
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:49,900
that I be reinstated as Prime Minister.

310
00:20:49,934 --> 00:20:52,210
I know my past is checkered,

311
00:20:52,244 --> 00:20:53,884
but I promise you,

312
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,495
I take full responsibility
for my people.

313
00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:00,713
And my heart now bleeds for your pain.

314
00:21:00,748 --> 00:21:03,559
However, from this point on,

315
00:21:03,593 --> 00:21:06,237
Mandalore will be strong,

316
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:09,585
and we will be known as the warriors

317
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,197
we were always meant to be.

318
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:28,903
You have done well, Prime Minister.

319
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:32,785
I shall waste no time
in building my administration.

320
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,793
Choose wisely.

321
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:38,677
I will hold you personally
responsible for their failures.

322
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,125
Yes, Master.

323
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,473
Is there anything more you require?

324
00:21:45,507 --> 00:21:47,482
Go.

325
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,360
Rule my people.

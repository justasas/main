1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,729
Pursued by pirates!

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,189
While on a rite of passage,

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,109
six Jedi younglings and Ahsoka Tano
are ambushed.

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,906
Protecting the young Jedi, Ahsoka was
captured by the nefarious Hondo Ohnaka

5
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,283
and taken to the planet Florrum.

6
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,494
Marshaling their courage and training,

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,415
the younglings infiltrated
the pirate stronghold and rescued Ahsoka.

8
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:45,838
Now we find our heroes in a race to
their starship, with the pirates closing in.

9
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,813
I know. I see them. They're gaining on us!

10
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,446
Uh...

11
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,824
I think they're still upset
that we tricked them.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,539
They'll get over it
once we're off their planet.

13
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,502
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

14
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,628
Right!

15
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,755
Ganodi, we need a quick evac.

16
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,132
Come in, please.

17
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,383
Ganodi!

18
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,343
Uh, maybe the pirates
are jamming the signal.

19
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,721
Where could she be?

20
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,056
Ganodi! Huyang! Come in!

21
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,440
Attaching your head
took a lot longer than I thought it would.

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,400
It is appreciated, youngling.

23
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,069
Mobility is paramount,
especially in an emergency.

24
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:52,696
Ganodi! Where are you?

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,241
I'm here. I was in the back fixing Huyang.

26
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,492
Great! That's great!

27
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,412
But we're all gonna need repairs
if you don't have the engines running!

28
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,122
- Where are you?
- Ganodi.

29
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,749
It's Ahsoka.

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,460
Padawan Tano!
We rescued you!

31
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:10,130
Almost, but we need you to get us home.
Are you ready?

32
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,007
Just tell me what I need to do.

33
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,219
Okay, fire up the engines
and head to these coordinates.

34
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:16,678
We'll be right there!

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,497
- There they are!
- Artoo.

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,166
Hold her steady
and lower the boarding ramp.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,003
Come on!

38
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,438
Looks like our ride is here.

39
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,858
Everyone, get top side and stay down.

40
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,654
But who's going to pilot the tank?

41
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,866
Katooni, grab that mask!

42
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,288
Uh, that'll have to do.

43
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,390
The steering must have come loose!

44
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,108
We got him!

45
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,736
Hang on!

46
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,743
Oh, no.

47
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,747
No! No! No!

48
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,223
They're coming back!

49
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,454
Artoo, get out of there now!

50
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,627
Everyone, let go!

51
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,878
Jump down now!

52
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,216
Abandon ship!

53
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,442
Nice try, little Jedi,

54
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,237
but it looks like you're coming with us.

55
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,005
What the...

56
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,966
Droids?

57
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,761
It's an invasion.

58
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,700
Boss! Boss!

59
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,828
We're all in trouble!

60
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,631
Hondo!

61
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,634
General Grievous, I presume?

62
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:24,801
What a surprise.

63
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,678
Have a seat.

64
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,805
What may I ask is the honor?

65
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,685
You can dispense
with the pleasantries, pirate.

66
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,356
This planet is now under
Separatist control.

67
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,649
Uh-huh.

68
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,985
And what do you suppose that means?

69
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:46,198
It means you have a new master,
pirate scum.

70
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,833
Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again.

71
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,710
As I recall,
the last time we met face-to-face,

72
00:06:58,836 --> 00:07:04,508
I was your prisoner and you attempted to
barter me off to the highest bidder.

73
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,676
But can you blame me?

74
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,555
I mean, a Sith Lord,
what a handsome price you would catch...

75
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,722
Silence!

76
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:13,725
You are going to
pay the price for your treachery.

77
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,519
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

78
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,604
Name the price.
I'm sure we can reach an equitable...

79
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:21,525
There will be payment,
but no deals, only demands.

80
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,403
Your entire arsenal will be melted down.

81
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:29,950
Everything you own
is now property of the Separatist Alliance.

82
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,535
Now you go too far!

83
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,120
Unacceptable!

84
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,247
This is an outrage! This...

85
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:38,417
Hold on... We can make a deal. Wait, wait!

86
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,545
This is not good business!

87
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,881
This isn't good.

88
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,884
Those scrappin' droids
are looting the place!

89
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,927
They're dismantling our ships!

90
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,263
The fact that Grievous is here
with his entire fleet

91
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,391
means that Master Kenobi
must have been overrun.

92
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,895
This entire system
is now in Separatist controlled space.

93
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,564
What should we do?
There's nowhere to run.

94
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:05,068
You're not running anywhere, scug.
You're still my prisoner.

95
00:08:05,194 --> 00:08:10,032
Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists
in exchange for my freedom.

96
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,617
Not likely.

97
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,036
Grievous didn't come here to make deals.

98
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,747
He already controls
the planet and the system.

99
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:20,417
If you hand us over to him,
he'll kill us and then you.

100
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,796
We have a common enemy in Grievous.
Together, we can get out of this.

101
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,924
You must have
some other ships somewhere.

102
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,217
You are pirates.

103
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:33,138
Hondo's got a private fleet,
but only he knows where those ships are.

104
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,432
Then we'll have to rescue him.

105
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,727
I know Grievous, and I know droids.

106
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,064
With my help, you stand a better chance.

107
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,783
You got yourself a deal, Jedi.

108
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,467
Halt!

109
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,638
You captured this tank?

110
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,807
Not bad for an astromech.

111
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,310
What's your ID number?

112
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:24,815
Hey!

113
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,777
Do not get smart with me. I outrank you.

114
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,325
You just watch yourself.

115
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,328
I could have you melted down
with the rest of this junk.

116
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,455
That's right.

117
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, take it over to Hangar 12.

118
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,838
And no detours. We'll be watching you.

119
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:14,364
Jedi, and here I thought
you made your escape, no?

120
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:17,701
No, there were complications.

121
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,996
Now we have to put our differences aside
and be friends,

122
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,040
or else we're all going to die here.

123
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,166
Ah.

124
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,543
Very diplomatic.

125
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:30,005
I knew you did not come back
to rescue Hondo,

126
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:33,550
how do you say it,
"Out of the goodness of your hearts?"

127
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,927
No, no, no, no.

128
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:37,888
You need something from me.

129
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,432
- A ship, to be specific.
- Ah!

130
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes, a ship, a ship.

131
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,188
But where would we find one of those?

132
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,942
My new friend General Grievous
has destroyed my ships.

133
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,736
We know you have one,
a whole pirate fleet!

134
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:58,367
And one of my old friends, apparently,
has been talking too much.

135
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,745
Ah! What does it matter?

136
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,083
We'll never reach the vault anyway.
Grievous's army is way too big.

137
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,085
Don't give up. We can fight!

138
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,382
If I may, sir, I have instructed younglings
for over a thousand generations,

139
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,218
and these
are among the best I have ever seen.

140
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,304
Well, then, show me.

141
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,599
Show me your swords, tiny Jedi.

142
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,103
Show Hondo you are ready to fight.

143
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,647
Ah.

144
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,275
And you, child, where is your saber?

145
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,819
It's not finished.

146
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:35,070
I never finished it.

147
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,823
I've done everything right,
but it won't work!

148
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,283
You must trust that

149
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,662
the components that form your lightsaber
are meant to be together.

150
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,289
There is no other way.

151
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,833
It is the Force that binds them.

152
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,628
Yes, I was just going to say that.
Finish it now. Finish. Finish.

153
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,298
This is worth the price of a ship.

154
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:59,011
To see the construction of
a Jedi lightsaber, this...

155
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,512
This is priceless!

156
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:05,100
Finish it, and together,
we can defeat Grievous.

157
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,444
Oh, amazing!

158
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,658
That is truly amazing.

159
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,170
Well, cut me down, little Jedi.
It's time to leave.

160
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,845
- Look at that!
- So exciting!

161
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,305
So, why the big show?

162
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:47,351
You didn't really have a choice.
You know we have to work together.

163
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:52,856
Because, Jedi, you know what
we are about to attempt is very dangerous,

164
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,696
and I may be a pirate,
but I do not like taking children into battle.

165
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,366
That didn't seem to bother you
when you attacked us.

166
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,373
Well, today is a new day,
and lucky for you, today, I like children.

167
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,000
Now, let's free the rest of my men.

168
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,358
This is OOM-87, General.

169
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,238
The prison area is under attack.
There are several miniature Jedi here.

170
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,576
What? You aren't making any sense.
What Jedi?

171
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:50,038
Little ones, half the size of a normal Jedi.
They're freeing the prisoners and...

172
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,206
My knees!

173
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,418
Ah!

174
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:56,253
Prepare to open fire.

175
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,922
We will bring the building down
on their heads.

176
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,806
I got your back.

177
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,851
Great. I feel so safe.

178
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,829
They run.

179
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,330
Quickly, after them!

180
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,208
They went the wrong way!

181
00:15:58,292 --> 00:16:00,043
Don't worry.

182
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:26,570
What about the others?
We can't just leave them.

183
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,239
You are welcome to come, small one.

184
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,242
You may join our merry band of pirates.

185
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,161
I won't just run away.

186
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,664
Ahsoka trusted you. We all trusted you.

187
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,721
Artoo, do something!

188
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,265
I don't know.
We have to shake Grievous off.

189
00:16:55,349 --> 00:16:57,059
Get aggressive. Ah!

190
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,203
Too aggressive. Far too aggressive.

191
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:17,454
Whoa!

192
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:29,216
Yes, well, it was an effective strategy,
but not what I would recommend.

193
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:57,494
So many lightsabers
to add to my collection.

194
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,840
Hurry!

195
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,008
Come on!

196
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,593
Run.

197
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,678
All of you, run!

198
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,046
Ha!

199
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,734
- Ahsoka, come on!
- Come on, Ahsoka!

200
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,244
You will never defeat Grievous.

201
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:23,580
Never!

202
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:25,874
I wouldn't be so sure.

203
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:31,088
Did we get him?

204
00:19:31,213 --> 00:19:32,840
I can't tell.

205
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,181
Show's over, kiddies. Let's get out of here.

206
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,251
And let me see...

207
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:13,672
Oh, the cost of the fuel.
I had to use a lot of fuel.

208
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,092
The general wear and tear
on my men and equipment.

209
00:20:17,176 --> 00:20:20,262
A couple of them died, I think.

210
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:26,185
Believe me, Kenobi, staging a rescue
is not an inexpensive proposition.

211
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:29,646
So you mean to tell me
you were staging a rescue,

212
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,441
not attempting to hijack a Jedi starship?

213
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,152
You're welcome! Oh!

214
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,863
The thanklessness! What an accusation!

215
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,782
I am gone! I will send you my bill!

216
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,222
Ahsoka.

217
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,973
It's good to see you are all safe.

218
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:08,727
Yes, Master.
We had quite an eventful mission.

219
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,895
The most eventful

220
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:14,274
since the time Master Yoda
went to find his lightsaber crystal.

221
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,651
What?

222
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,903
- Oh... Tell us!
- What happened then?

223
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,365
I'm afraid that story will have to wait.

224
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,908
For now, be proud.

225
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,078
You have survived an ordeal
few your age could.

226
00:21:28,247 --> 00:21:30,874
Welcome home, young Jedi.

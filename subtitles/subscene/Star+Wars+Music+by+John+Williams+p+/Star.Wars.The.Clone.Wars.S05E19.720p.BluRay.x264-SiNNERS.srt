1
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:20,580
<i>Ahsoka Tano on the run!</i>

2
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,615
<i>After an attack on the Jedi Temple,</i>

3
00:00:22,683 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan
found herself accused</i>

4
00:00:25,885 --> 00:00:29,187
<i>of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.</i>

5
00:00:29,254 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>With no choice but to run,
she was chased by her master,</i>

6
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,291
<i>who begged her to turn herself in.</i>

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,761
<i>Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,</i>

8
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:40,797
<i>Ahsoka decided to find out the truth</i>

9
00:00:40,864 --> 00:00:44,733
<i>and prove her innocence on her own.</i>

10
00:00:48,638 --> 00:00:50,972
<i>After further investigation,
there can be little doubt</i>

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,241
<i>that the clone officers
murdered in the escape</i>

12
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:56,410
<i>were killed by none other
than Ahsoka Tano herself.</i>

13
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:57,777
<i>She used a Jedi mind trick</i>

14
00:00:57,845 --> 00:00:59,946
<i>to convince the clone to open the door</i>

15
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:01,614
<i>and then proceeded to cut him down</i>

16
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,116
<i>along with five other clones
along the way.</i>

17
00:01:04,184 --> 00:01:09,688
I do not believe that Ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

18
00:01:09,756 --> 00:01:12,690
<i>The beliefs of
the Jedi Council are irrelevant.</i>

19
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:15,425
<i>We deal strictly in facts and evidence,</i>

20
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,061
<i>and the evidence points
to Padawan Tano being guilty</i>

21
00:01:18,128 --> 00:01:19,562
<i>of the attack on the temple</i>

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,497
<i>and the murder of the Republic officers.</i>

23
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,597
<i>This is sedition.</i>

24
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:30,569
Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your Padawan

25
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:32,604
before she escaped?

26
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,505
No, Master Mundi.

27
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:36,740
The Council believes that Ahsoka

28
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,808
may be guilty of the crime,

29
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,211
still believe they are wrong,
do you, hmm?

30
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,879
I believe she didn't kill
the clone troopers

31
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:45,513
or the woman
who used the nano-droids

32
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,881
to blow up the temple.

33
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:48,449
That's why she's running.

34
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:50,151
To prove her innocence.

35
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,052
Now she's in the lower depths.

36
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,488
With her skills,
she will be hard to find.

37
00:01:55,555 --> 00:01:57,757
Two teams we will send.

38
00:01:57,824 --> 00:02:00,659
Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon,

39
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,828
with clones you will go.

40
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:06,798
I think it would be best
if Skywalker stayed here.

41
00:02:06,866 --> 00:02:11,336
Having you involved
may actually make things worse.

42
00:02:11,404 --> 00:02:14,205
Master Windu, with all due respect,

43
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:16,374
she is <i>my</i> Padawan.

44
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:19,310
The reason for you not to go.

45
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:20,459
I think we're being foolish

46
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:23,081
if we take Anakin off this mission.

47
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:24,381
Who knows her better?

48
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,983
He's emotionally tied to her.

49
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:28,385
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

50
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:30,587
I'd rather capture Ahsoka
and find out the truth

51
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,890
then let her run because of a lie.

52
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:36,427
You must prove to us
that you will stay focused.

53
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:37,761
Can you?

54
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:40,398
I've already alerted security
on the lower levels

55
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:44,068
to be on the lookout for Ahsoka.

56
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:48,372
Go swiftly then, Skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

57
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,908
before it is too late.

58
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:52,843
Yes, Master.

59
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,378
This one just came in.

60
00:03:30,446 --> 00:03:33,648
Looks like the Jedi
are after one of their own.

61
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:34,755
She's armed and dangerous.

62
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:37,751
Alert all units.

63
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,486
You heard him.

64
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,037
Barriss, it's Ahsoka.

65
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,506
Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe.

66
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,842
- Safe but on the run.
- Where?

67
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:06,043
I can't tell you,

68
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,645
but someone is definitely trying
to frame me.

69
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:10,033
It's not safe for you to call me

70
00:04:10,047 --> 00:04:11,781
using the Jedi communicator.

71
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:13,683
Find another way to contact me.

72
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:14,950
I will.

73
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:16,538
In the meantime, I'll do some digging

74
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:17,987
and see if I can find anything out

75
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:19,588
to help you on my end.

76
00:04:19,656 --> 00:04:20,656
Thank you, Barriss.

77
00:04:20,657 --> 00:04:22,491
Be safe.

78
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,770
Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

79
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:38,474
Yeah.

80
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,742
Let's make a trade.

81
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:46,081
What do you want?

82
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,649
Your cloak.

83
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,955
Passes, please.

84
00:05:29,022 --> 00:05:31,024
Passes, please.

85
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:37,195
Passes, please.

86
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,540
That's her.
The rogue Jedi.

87
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,479
All units respond.

88
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:57,380
We have located the rogue Jedi.

89
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:59,415
- Uh.
- Whoa.

90
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,220
- Ah!
- Oh.

91
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:06,421
Get out of the way.
Look out!

92
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:08,957
Stop her!

93
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,892
I've got her.

94
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:14,663
Ah!

95
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,030
Ugh.

96
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:18,098
- Look out.
- Ah.

97
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,401
- Whoa.
- Ah!

98
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,913
<i>Dupa-la zuga lu!</i>

99
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,981
Sir, look!

100
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:38,684
Stop!

101
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,459
Not good.

102
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,765
Don't worry, little guy,
I'll get us out of this.

103
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,502
I'll... I'll think of something.

104
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:07,103
Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof.

105
00:07:08,605 --> 00:07:11,539
<i>Ya kumay na.</i>
<i>Ya kumay na.</i>

106
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:12,774
Almost there.
<i>Kumay na.</i>

107
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:15,809
Almost got it.
<i>Kumay na.</i>

108
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:16,876
<i>Kumay na.</i>

109
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,346
<i>Kumay na.</i>

110
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:22,947
Huh.

111
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:27,618
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

112
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:40,529
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

113
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:06,738
The lower level police claim
to have spotted Commander Tano

114
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,875
heading to level 1312.

115
00:08:08,943 --> 00:08:11,178
All right, let's bring her home.

116
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:44,408
Uh!

117
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:48,712
Well, well, I didn't believe it

118
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,247
when I first heard it,

119
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:52,182
but I guess it's true,

120
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:55,984
the Senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

121
00:08:58,154 --> 00:09:00,489
And I'm going to be the one
who collects.

122
00:09:00,557 --> 00:09:04,159
Ventress, it was you, wasn't it?

123
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:07,862
You were behind all of this,
and you framed me!

124
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,364
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:13,500
Yes, you do!

126
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:17,302
So what are you now, a bounty hunter?

127
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,340
Yes, and someone who knows
how to make easy money.

128
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:33,748
You think
you're just gonna hand me over?

129
00:09:33,816 --> 00:09:36,683
And then what?
Get a pat on the shoulder?

130
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,917
You're Separatist war criminal
and a Sith.

131
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:41,753
They'll have us both in prison
before you said your name.

132
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,355
I don't have to hand you
over to the Jedi.

133
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:45,988
I can hand you over to the bondsman

134
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:47,690
and still get paid.

135
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:51,626
I'm gonna get my money
whether you're dead or alive.

136
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:53,394
Heh, good luck.

137
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:56,296
Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi.

138
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm afraid the other Jedi
no longer see it that way.

139
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:04,370
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

140
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,538
That's why I'm going to need your help.

141
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:12,110
In what star system do you
think I would ever help you?

142
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,878
A traitorous Jedi tried
to blow up the Jedi Temple

143
00:10:14,946 --> 00:10:17,581
and has framed me for that
and other killings.

144
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,719
Mmm, so the Jedi
aren't that holy after all.

145
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,788
I know Dooku tried to have you killed.

146
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,191
I know he betrayed you.

147
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,460
What if this is his new apprentice?

148
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,828
I've fallen from my path

149
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:32,831
just as you've fallen from yours.

150
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,266
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

151
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:39,770
What can you offer me
that's better than money?

152
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,607
If you help me,
I'll speak to the Council

153
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,775
and the Senate on your behalf.

154
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:47,545
I'll get you a full pardon
for your crimes.

155
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,714
You have my attention.

156
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,884
But I'm going to go
where the tide flows.

157
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:55,919
If the tide is flowing against you,

158
00:10:55,987 --> 00:11:00,190
don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

159
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,559
Fair enough.

160
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:06,329
I suggest we find
somewhere else to discuss this.

161
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,891
Shine the light over there.

162
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:12,668
Stay where you are!

163
00:11:33,187 --> 00:11:35,188
Ventress.

164
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:37,890
Send out the probes.

165
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,525
I want them found now!

166
00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:51,603
Nice place you have here.

167
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:53,238
Not everyone on Coruscant

168
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:56,874
lives in a luxurious temple
on the surface.

169
00:11:56,942 --> 00:11:59,010
I guess I'll have to get used to that.

170
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,045
Just make the call.

171
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,921
Adding another criminal act
to your record?

172
00:12:11,988 --> 00:12:15,624
I don't want them
to be able to trace it.

173
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,359
Barriss, it's me.

174
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:21,095
It's so good to see you, Ahsoka.

175
00:12:21,163 --> 00:12:22,163
Are you okay?

176
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:23,598
Yeah, I'm okay,

177
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,933
if you consider Anakin
and a hundred clones on my tail

178
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,400
a good space to be in.

179
00:12:27,468 --> 00:12:28,935
You were almost captured?

180
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:30,804
Once or twice, yeah.

181
00:12:30,872 --> 00:12:31,939
Where are you?

182
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:33,874
I can't say, Barriss.

183
00:12:33,942 --> 00:12:35,675
I believe I've found a clue.

184
00:12:35,742 --> 00:12:37,043
A clue?

185
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,812
How?
From where?

186
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,380
We don't have much time, Ahsoka.

187
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,417
Fine, I'm on level 1312.

188
00:12:49,723 --> 00:12:51,624
A holo-booth
at the corner of 12th and G.

189
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,125
Got it.

190
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:56,127
Three levels up there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

191
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:57,562
where they used to build munitions

192
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,797
that Letta visited during
the time she was getting access

193
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,065
to the nano-droids.

194
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,934
How did you find this out?

195
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,969
I told you I would do some checking.

196
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,970
Ah, thank you, Barriss.

197
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,373
Be careful, Ahsoka.

198
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,378
Well?

199
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:18,047
I think I have a lead.

200
00:13:25,122 --> 00:13:27,489
It doesn't seem like you need my help.

201
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,757
That's not true.

202
00:13:28,825 --> 00:13:30,859
We need to find
an abandoned munitions warehouse

203
00:13:30,927 --> 00:13:32,461
on level 1315.

204
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:35,197
We should be able to find
some information there.

205
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,836
You know the place
I'm talking about, don't you?

206
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,071
Yes.

207
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,773
I can get you there.

208
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:51,847
Listen to me.

209
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,182
I don't want to fight.

210
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:56,984
I do.

211
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,953
We're taking you in now, Commander.

212
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,223
That's not gonna happen, trust me.

213
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,892
Now I'm not going to hurt
any of you...

214
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,328
we're not going to hurt
any of you...

215
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:10,864
but you're not taking me in.

216
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:15,434
Commander, we are taking you in.

217
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:17,669
Let's play.

218
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,837
Take 'em out.
Ah!

219
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:19,945
Take her out.
Take her out.

220
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,339
Ventress, don't.

221
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,475
Look out!
Ugh!

222
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,744
They'll cut us down!

223
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:29,946
Oh!

224
00:14:30,013 --> 00:14:31,013
Watch it!

225
00:14:33,016 --> 00:14:34,016
Take a shot.

226
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:37,651
Too fast.

227
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,190
Arg.

228
00:14:49,193 --> 00:14:50,527
Ah, oh.

229
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,399
See?

230
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,702
Didn't kill one.

231
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,804
It's the new me.

232
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:08,242
General Plo Koon, we had Commander Tano,

233
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,578
but she escaped
with the help of Asajj Ventress.

234
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,567
There it is.

235
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:23,470
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

236
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:35,715
I've done my part of the bargain,

237
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:38,217
which means you're on your own
from here.

238
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:39,685
But don't forget,

239
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:42,287
you have to speak on my behalf now.

240
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:43,722
That was the deal.

241
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,123
Agreed.

242
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,825
Thanks for getting this far, at least.

243
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,660
I have to admit,

244
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:54,565
I never saw us
doing anything together. Ever.

245
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:57,934
These are strange times.

246
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:29,798
I thought we decided
we were going to part ways.

247
00:16:44,012 --> 00:16:45,379
Ugh, ah!

248
00:16:56,554 --> 00:16:57,554
Ah!

249
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,903
How am I supposed to find a clue

250
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,005
when I don't even know
what I'm looking for?

251
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,211
Uh!

252
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,354
Ventress!

253
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:46,456
I see you've had a change of heart.

254
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,401
Why bring me here?

255
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,836
Answer me, Ventress.

256
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,903
Why?

257
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:51,304
Ah!

258
00:19:09,653 --> 00:19:10,719
Calling all units.

259
00:19:10,787 --> 00:19:13,755
Suspicious activity on level 1315.

260
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:35,608
Ugh.

261
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:05,301
Nano-droids?

262
00:20:12,475 --> 00:20:14,443
No, Wolffe, let me explain.

263
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:31,458
Explosives.

264
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,360
These are the same types
of nano-droids

265
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,329
that were used to blow up
the Jedi Temple.

266
00:20:36,397 --> 00:20:38,198
I can't believe it.

267
00:20:46,339 --> 00:20:48,073
<i>Captured she has been?</i>

268
00:20:48,141 --> 00:20:50,041
Yes, Master Yoda.

269
00:20:50,109 --> 00:20:51,643
<i>Without incident?</i>

270
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:54,346
No, she was subdued by the clones

271
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:58,583
and found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

272
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,586
It still doesn't explain
Ventress's involvement.

273
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,855
We saw her with Ahsoka.

274
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:06,258
<i>I think there's more going on
than we know.</i>

275
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:09,494
By Ahsoka or against her?

276
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,762
<i>That remains to be seen.</i>

277
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,497
<i>We're bringing her back to the temple.</i>

278
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,333
<i>Let's just hope we can keep her here.</i>

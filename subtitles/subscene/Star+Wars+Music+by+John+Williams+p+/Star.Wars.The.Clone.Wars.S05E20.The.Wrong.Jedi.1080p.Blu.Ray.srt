1
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,188
<i>Ahsoka Tano captured!</i>

2
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>While on the run to prove her innocence,</i>

3
00:00:23,358 --> 00:00:26,526
<i>Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress</i>

4
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,496
<i>to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.</i>

5
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:32,898
<i>The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker</i>

6
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,901
<i>and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down</i>

7
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,069
<i>and bring her back to the Temple.</i>

8
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:39,871
<i>Now captured and imprisoned,</i>

9
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:44,609
<i>Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.</i>

10
00:00:44,676 --> 00:00:47,478
<i>The Senate requests
that Ahsoka Tano be indicted</i>

11
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:50,381
<i>for acts of treason
against the Republic.</i>

12
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,350
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have

13
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:55,720
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

14
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:58,389
<i>Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.</i>

15
00:00:58,456 --> 00:01:00,057
<i>I'm afraid, Master Yoda,</i>

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:03,594
<i>that the Senate believes
that an internal Jedi trial</i>

17
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,830
<i>would seem biased.</i>

18
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,465
<i>Therefore, the Senate asks</i>

19
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:11,369
<i>that the Council expel
Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order</i>

20
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:14,205
<i>so that she may be put
to a Republic Military tribunal,</i>

21
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:17,609
<i>where she will receive
more impartial judgment.</i>

22
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:22,347
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

23
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:25,016
<i>That would be up
to the Council, General,</i>

24
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,186
<i>but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.</i>

25
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,787
Of course.

26
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,390
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

27
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,094
Thank you, Admiral.

28
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:40,097
Surely we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

29
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:42,598
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

30
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:44,900
And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

31
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:47,769
the mastermind behind the attack
on the Temple.

32
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:52,439
She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

33
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:54,742
This alone is enough to convict her.

34
00:01:54,809 --> 00:01:57,510
I understand your sentiment,
Obi-Wan,

35
00:01:57,578 --> 00:02:00,113
but if the Council does as you suggest,

36
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,049
it could be seen as an act of opposition

37
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:03,649
to the Senate.

38
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:07,186
I'm afraid we have little choice.

39
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,021
Hmm.

40
00:02:09,089 --> 00:02:10,556
To the Chamber of Judgment,

41
00:02:10,624 --> 00:02:13,258
summon Skywalker and his Padawan,

42
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:17,261
and in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

43
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,009
You're not helping.

44
00:02:34,478 --> 00:02:36,245
I'm sorry, Snips.

45
00:02:36,313 --> 00:02:39,046
I just... I just don't know
what to do.

46
00:02:39,114 --> 00:02:40,147
It's okay.

47
00:02:40,215 --> 00:02:41,415
I don't either.

48
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:21,983
Padawan Tano,

49
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,286
serious charges
have been levied against you.

50
00:03:25,354 --> 00:03:27,122
How plead you?

51
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:28,723
Not guilty, Master.

52
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,526
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

53
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:34,495
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

54
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:36,732
There is evidence to the contrary.

55
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,168
You were alone with
Letta Turmond when she died.

56
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:40,969
Can you explain this?

57
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:43,770
Someone used the Force against her.

58
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:45,472
Which brings us to Ventress.

59
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,975
Can you explain your association
with her?

60
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:50,944
We had a mutual understanding.

61
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:52,346
I thought she was helping me.

62
00:03:52,413 --> 00:03:54,413
Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

63
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,815
found when you were apprehended,

64
00:03:55,883 --> 00:03:58,050
the same devices used
in the bombing of the Temple?

65
00:03:58,118 --> 00:04:01,687
No, I was set up and deceived,

66
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,823
as you are being deceived now.

67
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,091
The question is, Padawan Tano,

68
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,126
who is deceiving us?

69
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,595
Ventress, you, or someone else?

70
00:04:10,663 --> 00:04:12,530
I am not deceiving you.

71
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:14,833
I would assume Ventress is,

72
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,400
but I can't be sure.

73
00:04:16,468 --> 00:04:19,202
My sense is clouded.

74
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:21,004
Clouded by the dark side

75
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,205
these things are, Padawan Tano.

76
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:25,107
Dangerously clouded,

77
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,142
but not just surrounding you,

78
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,011
surrounding many things in these times.

79
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:32,780
You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

80
00:04:32,848 --> 00:04:36,183
This meeting is just a formality!

81
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:39,619
Reached a decision, we have,

82
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:42,455
though not in total agreement are we.

83
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,691
It is the Council's opinion

84
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:46,993
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano
has committed sedition

85
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:48,461
against the Republic,

86
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:53,999
and thus, she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

87
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,434
You can't do this!

88
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:58,503
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

89
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,872
and you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

90
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:03,641
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

91
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,743
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts

92
00:05:05,811 --> 00:05:07,278
to await your trail

93
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:10,148
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

94
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:14,750
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

95
00:05:30,032 --> 00:05:32,667
Padmé has agreed to represent
you before the Senate.

96
00:05:32,735 --> 00:05:36,070
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

97
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:38,472
I am almost certain
that the person behind this

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,674
is Ventress,

99
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:42,177
and you know I wasn't working with her.

100
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,845
She was at the warehouse...

101
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:44,845
in the room.

102
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,448
We fought, but she got away.

103
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:51,753
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

104
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,489
No, none of the clones
reported seeing Ventress

105
00:05:54,557 --> 00:05:56,057
at the scene.

106
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,425
I thought you said Ventress left

107
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,193
before you went into the warehouse.

108
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,695
That's what I thought, too,

109
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:03,131
but then she attacked me
when I got inside.

110
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:05,733
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

111
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:09,536
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

112
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,572
Wait, where are you going?

113
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,073
You can't leave now.

114
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,275
Yes, I can.

115
00:06:15,343 --> 00:06:19,478
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

116
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,647
Until we hear from Anakin,

117
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,349
let's work on your defense.

118
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,852
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

119
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,353
I thought I was part of that Order,

120
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,923
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

121
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:34,191
I'm not holding out much hope

122
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,160
the Senate will treat me any better.

123
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,114
Anakin Skywalker.

124
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:21,146
I know you're behind all of this.

125
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,933
Prove it.

126
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,643
Leave me alone.

127
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,955
Tell me what happened.

128
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,660
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

129
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,661
I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

130
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:58,396
Bounty?

131
00:07:58,464 --> 00:08:00,165
I was going to catch your pet

132
00:08:00,233 --> 00:08:02,567
and turn her over to the authorities,

133
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:06,372
collect whatever bounty was due.

134
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
What stopped you?

135
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:14,113
At first... I admit... I was
just interested in the money

136
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,449
and a little bit of revenge,

137
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,918
but then I realized
your fallen Padawan and I

138
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,387
had a lot in common.

139
00:08:22,455 --> 00:08:25,458
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

140
00:08:25,525 --> 00:08:27,826
It's true.

141
00:08:27,894 --> 00:08:31,329
My master abandoned me,

142
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:36,300
and that's exactly what you did to her,

143
00:08:36,368 --> 00:08:40,137
you and your precious Jedi Order.

144
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:36,920
Ahsoka Tano,

145
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:39,056
you have been charged with sedition

146
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:43,761
against the Jedi Order
and the Republic itself.

147
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:47,297
This court will decide your fate.

148
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:51,367
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

149
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:56,607
Former Padawan Tano,

150
00:09:56,674 --> 00:09:59,308
I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

151
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:02,145
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple

152
00:10:02,213 --> 00:10:05,148
and that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

153
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:08,151
you eliminated them one by one.

154
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,818
When you are found guilty,

155
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:12,354
I ask the court
that the full extent of the law

156
00:10:12,422 --> 00:10:13,890
be brought down upon you,

157
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,825
including penalty of death.

158
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,598
After I left the warehouse,

159
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,768
after I left your little Padawan alone,

160
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,136
I was walking away,

161
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:30,306
and I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

162
00:10:30,374 --> 00:10:31,807
But I was wrong.

163
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:35,076
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

164
00:10:35,144 --> 00:10:38,213
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

165
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:40,582
It had to be another Jedi.

166
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:41,949
I don't believe you.

167
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,283
Believe it.

168
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,286
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

169
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:48,454
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

170
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,557
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

171
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:55,526
You're the only one
Ahsoka had talked to.

172
00:10:55,594 --> 00:10:57,461
That's not true.

173
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,330
What do you mean?

174
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:01,833
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

175
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:05,503
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

176
00:11:05,571 --> 00:11:07,472
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

177
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,840
in the first place.

178
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:12,745
It was this Barriss
that told us to go there.

179
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,580
If you're lying, you're dead.

180
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:17,815
Such promises.

181
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,220
Look at the facts.

182
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,955
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

183
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,090
to reveal the name
of the true mastermind

184
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,992
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

185
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,394
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

186
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:35,264
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

187
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:37,899
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

188
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,135
Letta Turmond was strangled to death

189
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:41,737
by way of the Force.

190
00:11:41,804 --> 00:11:44,306
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

191
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,275
with a method that would so obviously

192
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:48,143
tie the murder to her?

193
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:51,346
A Jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

194
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:54,550
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

195
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,118
Members of the court,

196
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:59,021
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

197
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:04,425
Well said, Senator Amidala.

198
00:12:04,492 --> 00:12:06,627
However, if she is innocent,

199
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:10,230
then why was she seen conspiring
with known Separatist terrorist

200
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:12,632
Asajj Ventress?

201
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,234
Ventress set me up.

202
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,169
My master will prove that.

203
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,405
And where is your master?

204
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,340
He's trying to find the real murderer.

205
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,444
Then maybe he should be looking at you.

206
00:12:49,028 --> 00:12:51,730
Enter.

207
00:12:51,798 --> 00:12:54,832
Barriss, I need to talk to you.

208
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,401
Master Skywalker,

209
00:12:56,469 --> 00:12:58,236
how can I help you?

210
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,371
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka

211
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:01,706
before she was arrested.

212
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:03,541
What did you say to her?

213
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:05,809
We've been friends for a long time.

214
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:07,711
I was only trying to help her.

215
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:09,412
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

216
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,947
It's no trouble.

217
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:13,417
I just need to know what you told her

218
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,885
and if you told anyone else.

219
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,787
No, I thought I had a clue for her,

220
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,755
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

221
00:13:19,823 --> 00:13:21,657
Who told you I spoke to her?

222
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,292
Ventress.

223
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,861
She told me.

224
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,396
Ventress?

225
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:29,331
Isn't she the one Ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

226
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,067
That's what Ahsoka says,

227
00:13:31,135 --> 00:13:33,336
but I think she's wrong.

228
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:35,772
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

229
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,673
And you believe her?

230
00:13:37,741 --> 00:13:40,075
Who else could it be if not her?

231
00:13:40,143 --> 00:13:41,410
Surely not Ahsoka.

232
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:45,681
No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either.

233
00:13:45,748 --> 00:13:49,217
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth,

234
00:13:49,285 --> 00:13:52,453
but there's only one way to find out.

235
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,925
Funny.
Those belong to Ventress.

236
00:14:00,261 --> 00:14:01,594
You should've gotten rid of them!

237
00:14:01,662 --> 00:14:04,364
I think they suit me.

238
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:12,437
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi

239
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:16,074
and think, "Surely
she cannot be this murderer"

240
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:19,044
or saboteur that they speak of."

241
00:14:19,111 --> 00:14:22,347
And yet think of all the times
we have been fooled

242
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:24,281
by the Separatists

243
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,484
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic

244
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:28,686
and ask yourself,

245
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:33,590
"Is this yet another
Separatist scheme?"

246
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:36,627
Another way to rip the Jedi,

247
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:39,564
and subsequently all of us,

248
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:41,199
apart.

249
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:48,906
Ahsoka trusted you,
and you betrayed her.

250
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:50,641
I've learned that trust is overrated.

251
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:52,910
The only thing
the Jedi Council believes in

252
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:54,145
is violence.

253
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:14,663
Cease hostility!

254
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,038
Barriss!

255
00:15:41,288 --> 00:15:42,288
Look out!

256
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:27,896
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

257
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,339
Ahsoka Tano,

258
00:16:39,407 --> 00:16:41,875
by an overwhelming count of...

259
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:44,377
Chancellor.

260
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:46,612
I hope you have a reason

261
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,314
for bursting into our proceedings,

262
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,617
Master Skywalker.

263
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:54,853
I'm here with evidence and a confession

264
00:16:54,921 --> 00:16:56,854
from the person responsible
for all the crimes

265
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:59,857
Ahsoka has been accused of.

266
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:04,028
Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order

267
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:05,630
and traitor.

268
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,104
Barriss, is that true?

269
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:16,106
Tell them the truth.

270
00:17:20,777 --> 00:17:22,544
I did it

271
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,379
because I've come to realize

272
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:25,914
what many of people in the Republic

273
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,415
have come to realize,

274
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:30,317
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

275
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:32,052
that we've so lost our way

276
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,521
that we have become villains
in this conflict,

277
00:17:34,588 --> 00:17:37,056
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

278
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,225
all of us!

279
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,326
And my attack on the Temple
was an attack

280
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,062
on what the Jedi have become,

281
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,065
an army fighting for the dark side,

282
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,801
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

283
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,103
This Republic is failing!

284
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,140
It's only a matter of time.

285
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,611
Take her away.

286
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:25,299
Ahsoka,

287
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,735
I am so sorry

288
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:32,040
about everything.

289
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,442
You have our most humble apologies,

290
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,343
little 'Soka.

291
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:39,446
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

292
00:18:39,514 --> 00:18:43,050
You have shown such
great strength and resilience

293
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:46,487
in your struggle
to prove your innocence.

294
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,856
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

295
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,826
This was actually your great trial.

296
00:18:52,893 --> 00:18:54,794
Now we see that.

297
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,564
We understand that the Force
works in mysterious ways,

298
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,331
and because of this trial,

299
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:04,070
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

300
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:08,008
Back into the Order you may come.

301
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,578
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

302
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:18,451
<i>I'm</i> asking you back.

303
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,976
I'm sorry, Master,

304
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:50,612
but I'm not coming back.

305
00:20:22,342 --> 00:20:25,611
Ahsoka, wait!

306
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,613
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

307
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:36,488
Why are you doing this?

308
00:20:36,556 --> 00:20:38,690
The Council didn't trust me,

309
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:41,092
so how can I trust myself?

310
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,827
What about me?

311
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:45,464
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

312
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:48,366
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

313
00:20:48,434 --> 00:20:50,568
and I'm grateful for that.

314
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:52,804
But this isn't about you.

315
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:56,006
I can't stay here any longer,

316
00:20:56,074 --> 00:20:57,975
not now.

317
00:20:58,043 --> 00:21:00,210
The Jedi Order is your life.

318
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:02,813
You can't just throw it away like this.

319
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,949
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

320
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:10,154
Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

321
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:12,755
without the Council

322
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:14,623
and without you.

323
00:21:16,927 --> 00:21:18,461
I understand.

324
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,630
More than you realize,

325
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:25,301
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

326
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,272
I know.

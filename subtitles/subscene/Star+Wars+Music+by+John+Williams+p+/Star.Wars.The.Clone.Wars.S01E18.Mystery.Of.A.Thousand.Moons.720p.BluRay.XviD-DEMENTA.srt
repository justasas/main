00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:01,175
I heard you were quite brave
fending off the battle droids, Jar Jar.

324
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,469
Really?

325
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,097
Senator Amidala suggested
we offer you training

326
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,641
to help hone your skills with a blaster.

327
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,018
-Really?
-Really.

328
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,105
Oh, boy! Ima gonna be trained!

329
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,149
I am not training him.

330
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,571
You did a fantastic job today, Snips.

331
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,283
All thanks to your training, Master.

332
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,036
Yeah, you're right, I probably
do deserve most of the credit,

333
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,165
but not all of it.

334
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:38,379
Good thing I know you don't mean
everything you say.

335
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,007
Pilot, get these two out of here.

336
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,134
Thank you, Master.

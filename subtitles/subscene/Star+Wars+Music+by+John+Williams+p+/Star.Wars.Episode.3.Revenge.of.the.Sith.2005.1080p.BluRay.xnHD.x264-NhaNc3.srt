1
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,869
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:13,408
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,738
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,369
Oh, I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:28,581
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,988
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,993
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,995
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,935
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:51,046 --> 00:03:53,071
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:13,767
They're all over me. Get them off my...

12
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,769
- I'm gonna go help them out.
- No.

13
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:18,567
No, they are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:32,554 --> 00:04:35,114
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:39,083
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:46,298
All right, R4.

17
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:48,926
No, no, no, no...
No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:55,938
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:07,279
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,655
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:28,673
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

22
00:05:36,284 --> 00:05:38,275
R4, be careful.
You have a...

23
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,319
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,325
They're shutting down
all the controls.

25
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:50,455
- Move to the right so I can get a
clear shot at them. - The mission.

26
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:54,399
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

27
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:01,571
In the name of...

28
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:07,848
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,019
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:22,193
They're all over me.
Anakin!

31
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:28,930
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,407
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:33,508 --> 00:06:35,669
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

34
00:06:44,686 --> 00:06:47,519
Get him, R2.

35
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:50,955
Watch out.

36
00:06:55,564 --> 00:06:57,896
R2, hit the buzz droid's
center eye.

37
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,438
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,644
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

39
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,807
Well, have you noticed
the shields are still up?

40
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:17,908
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:27,552
Oh, I have a bad feeling
about this.

42
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,537
There they are.
Get them.

43
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:58,085
R2, locate the chancellor.

44
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:09,164
The chancellor's signal is coming from right there...

45
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:12,331
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

46
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,374
I sense Count Dooku.

47
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:17,741
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

48
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:21,441
Spring the trap.

49
00:08:21,549 --> 00:08:24,712
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

50
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:26,719
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

51
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:44,527
What's the situation, Captain?

52
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,575
Two Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.
We're tracking them.

53
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:52,977
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

54
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,181
Destroyers.

55
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,261
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

56
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:10,854
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

57
00:09:10,965 --> 00:09:12,159
Roger, roger.

58
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:21,708
Those are Jedi fighters
all right.

59
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:28,339
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,715
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,617
We don't want to get out.

62
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:39,422
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:41,722
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,730
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,732
R2, activate
the elevator number...

66
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:48,064
31174.

67
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:51,104
Get back to work.
That nothin'.

68
00:09:51,206 --> 00:09:54,141
Activate the elevator 31174.

69
00:09:54,242 --> 00:09:56,142
R2, we...

70
00:10:01,316 --> 00:10:03,876
Always on the move.

71
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:05,885
R2, switch on the comlink.

72
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:07,978
R2, can you hear me?

73
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:10,557
R2?

74
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:14,119
R2! R2!

75
00:10:17,599 --> 00:10:20,932
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

76
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,305
Hands up, Jedi.

77
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,602
R2, do you copy?

78
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,668
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

79
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:39,520
Hey, you!

80
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:44,624
Now, that's better.

81
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:48,992
You stupid little astro droid.

82
00:10:59,207 --> 00:11:01,107
Oh, it's you.

83
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:05,041
My eyes! My eyes!

84
00:11:05,146 --> 00:11:07,614
- What was that all about?
- Well, R2 has been...

85
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:10,650
- Uh, no loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

86
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,686
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

87
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,225
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

88
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,921
Count Dooku.

89
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:02,401
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

90
00:12:11,346 --> 00:12:14,543
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

91
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,710
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

92
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,721
Your swords, please.

93
00:12:21,823 --> 00:12:25,281
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

94
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:27,623
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

95
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,574
I've been looking forward
to this.

96
00:12:40,675 --> 00:12:43,872
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

97
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:47,436
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

98
00:13:07,535 --> 00:13:08,502
Get...

99
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:38,824
I sense great fear
in you, Skywalker.

100
00:13:38,933 --> 00:13:42,596
You have hate.
You have anger.

101
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:44,604
But you don't use them.

102
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:08,024
Good, Anakin. Good.

103
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:10,120
Kill him.

104
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:13,191
Kill him now.

105
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,740
I shouldn't.

106
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:25,772
Do it.

107
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:39,659
You did well, Anakin.

108
00:14:39,761 --> 00:14:43,697
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

109
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:46,198
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

110
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,167
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

111
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:54,401
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

112
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,535
It wasn't
the first time, Anakin.

113
00:14:57,645 --> 00:15:01,411
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

114
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:07,780
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

115
00:15:12,193 --> 00:15:15,185
Anakin,
there's no time.

116
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:18,527
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

117
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:22,626
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

118
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:25,433
His fate will be
the same as ours.

119
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:32,038
Prepare for attack!

120
00:15:33,414 --> 00:15:36,247
All batteries, fire!
Fire!

121
00:15:46,327 --> 00:15:48,227
Elevator's not working.

122
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:54,627
R2, activate elevator 3224.

123
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:16,585
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

124
00:16:35,877 --> 00:16:37,970
Magnetize!
Magnetize!

125
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:47,884
Fire the emergency
booster engines.

126
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,792
We're leveling out, sir.

127
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,399
Oh!

128
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:12,739
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

129
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,475
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

130
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:17,744
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

131
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,843
R2. R2, shut down
the elevator.

132
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,888
Too late. Jump!

133
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:39,166
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

134
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,332
R2, get down here.

135
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,706
R2, do you copy?

136
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:50,378
General, we found the Jedi.

137
00:17:50,484 --> 00:17:54,887
- They're in hallway 328.
- Activate ray shields.

138
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,191
Ray shields.

139
00:17:59,293 --> 00:18:01,193
Wait a minute.
How did this happen?

140
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:03,627
- We're smarter than this.
- Apparently not.

141
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:08,796
- I say patience.
- Patience?

142
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:12,202
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

143
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:15,571
and then... he'll release
the ray shields.

144
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,413
See? No problem.

145
00:18:26,754 --> 00:18:28,654
Don't move.

146
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:34,593
Do you have a plan B?

147
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:44,830
Ah, yes.
The negotiator.

148
00:18:44,939 --> 00:18:49,171
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

149
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:51,438
Excuse me.

150
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:54,309
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

151
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,849
And...

152
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:59,749
Anakin Skywalker.

153
00:18:59,854 --> 00:19:05,554
I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.

154
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:11,961
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

155
00:19:12,066 --> 00:19:16,594
Jedi scum.

156
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:19,468
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

157
00:19:24,278 --> 00:19:28,942
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

158
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,713
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

159
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,050
R2.

160
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,522
Crush them!

161
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,688
Make them suffer!

162
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:49,396
Come. Now!

163
00:19:49,503 --> 00:19:51,664
- Stay at your stations!

164
00:19:58,346 --> 00:20:00,837
Get him! Get him!

165
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,100
Run!

166
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:28,199
- Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,882
You lose, General Kenobi.

168
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,805
Get out of here! Run!

169
00:21:20,961 --> 00:21:23,452
Time to abandon ship.

170
00:21:30,704 --> 00:21:33,104
All the escape pods have been launched.

171
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:36,267
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

172
00:21:36,377 --> 00:21:39,369
- You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing? - Well?

173
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,075
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

174
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,017
Strap yourselves in.

175
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,987
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

176
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:08,970
We lost something.

177
00:22:08,975 --> 00:22:11,443
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

178
00:22:15,747 --> 00:22:17,706
Now we're really picking up speed.

179
00:22:26,393 --> 00:22:28,156
Eight plus 60.

180
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:32,289
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

181
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:48,573
Steady.

182
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:51,310
Easy, R2.

183
00:22:54,522 --> 00:22:58,219
5000. Fire ships on
the left and the right.

184
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:01,021
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:03,464 --> 00:23:07,230
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:38,032 --> 00:23:40,296
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:10,531 --> 00:24:14,490
- Are you coming, Master?
- Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

188
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:16,502
I have to report
to the council.

189
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:19,072
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:23,007
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

191
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:26,204
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:26,313 --> 00:24:28,781
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:30,782
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

194
00:24:30,884 --> 00:24:33,409
All because of
your training.

195
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,012
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:37,124 --> 00:24:40,184
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:40,294 --> 00:24:44,355
All right. But you owe me one, and not for
saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:44,465 --> 00:24:48,697
Ninth time. That business
on Cato Neimoidia doesn't...doesn't count.

199
00:24:48,802 --> 00:24:50,702
I'll see you
at the briefing.

200
00:24:56,076 --> 00:24:58,601
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

201
00:24:58,712 --> 00:25:01,613
Yes. Thanks to your
two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:06,379
They killed Count Dooku,
but General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:10,014
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:10,124 --> 00:25:14,424
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:14,528 --> 00:25:20,296
And I assure you, the senate will vote
to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

206
00:25:20,401 --> 00:25:24,428
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

207
00:25:25,906 --> 00:25:27,840
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

208
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:30,910
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

209
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:33,138
Thank you, Senator Organa.

210
00:25:33,247 --> 00:25:36,808
Well, it couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

211
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:38,851
Now there I agree with you.

212
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:42,319
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

213
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:47,554
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

214
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:50,152
Well, I will do everything I can in the senate.

215
00:25:50,264 --> 00:25:52,528
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

216
00:26:03,143 --> 00:26:05,043
Oh, Anakin.

217
00:26:08,047 --> 00:26:09,905
I've missed you, Padmé.

218
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:14,249
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

219
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:16,915
I'm all right.

220
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:20,016
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

221
00:26:20,127 --> 00:26:22,925
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

222
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,295
I don't think they would have ever
brought us back from the outer rim sieges.

223
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,130
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

224
00:26:29,236 --> 00:26:32,728
I'm...I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

225
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,104
Anakin, don't say
things like that.

226
00:26:43,917 --> 00:26:47,546
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

227
00:26:47,654 --> 00:26:49,747
What's going on?

228
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,794
Something wonderful
has happened.

229
00:26:54,895 --> 00:26:59,264
Ani, I'm pregnant.

230
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,170
That's...

231
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,869
Well, that's won...
That's wonderful.

232
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:17,607
What are we gonna do?

233
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,520
We're not gonna worry
about anything right now. All right?

234
00:27:22,623 --> 00:27:25,091
This is a happy moment.

235
00:27:27,094 --> 00:27:29,392
The happiest moment
of my life.

236
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,392
Yes, Lord Sidious?

237
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,399
General Grievous...

238
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:45,598
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

239
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:49,574
It will be done,
my lord.

240
00:28:49,676 --> 00:28:53,942
The end of the war
is near, General.

241
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:57,676
But the loss
of Count Dooku...

242
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:02,084
His death was
a necessary loss.

243
00:29:02,189 --> 00:29:06,319
Soon I will have
a new apprentice...

244
00:29:06,426 --> 00:29:11,693
one far younger
and more powerful.

245
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:41,751
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

246
00:29:41,862 --> 00:29:45,195
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

247
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,199
where we can be safe.

248
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:51,734
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

249
00:29:53,774 --> 00:29:59,041
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

250
00:30:03,317 --> 00:30:06,616
You are so... beautiful.

251
00:30:08,255 --> 00:30:10,280
It's only because
I'm so in love.

252
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,824
No.

253
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:16,123
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

254
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:19,756
So love has blinded you?

255
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:23,593
Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.

256
00:30:25,205 --> 00:30:27,230
But it's probably true.

257
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:38,776
Anakin, help me!

258
00:31:41,615 --> 00:31:43,515
What's bothering you?

259
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:47,943
Nothing.

260
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:52,222
I remember when
I gave this to you.

261
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:56,523
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

262
00:31:59,132 --> 00:32:01,032
It was a dream.

263
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:03,261
Bad?

264
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,804
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother...

265
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:07,806
just before she died.

266
00:32:07,908 --> 00:32:09,808
And?

267
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:14,613
And it was about you.

268
00:32:17,184 --> 00:32:19,084
Tell me.

269
00:32:20,854 --> 00:32:22,788
It was only a dream.

270
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,670
You die in childbirth.

271
00:32:37,771 --> 00:32:40,569
And the baby?

272
00:32:40,674 --> 00:32:43,006
I don't know.

273
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,411
It was only a dream.

274
00:32:46,513 --> 00:32:49,311
I won't let this one
become real.

275
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,045
This baby will change
our lives.

276
00:32:53,153 --> 00:32:56,088
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

277
00:32:56,189 --> 00:32:58,919
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

278
00:32:59,025 --> 00:33:01,516
I...I know. I know.

279
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:05,291
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

280
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:09,359
We don't need his help.

281
00:33:10,704 --> 00:33:13,696
Our baby is a blessing.

282
00:33:29,923 --> 00:33:34,053
Premonitions?
Premonitions. Hmm.

283
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:37,324
These visions you have...

284
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,025
They're of pain,
suffering.

285
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:44,869
Death.

286
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:49,340
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

287
00:33:50,844 --> 00:33:52,869
Someone.

288
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,879
Close to you?

289
00:33:56,082 --> 00:33:58,277
Yes.

290
00:33:58,385 --> 00:34:02,253
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

291
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:06,655
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

292
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:12,194
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

293
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:15,496
Death is
a natural part of life.

294
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:20,266
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

295
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:23,672
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

296
00:34:23,777 --> 00:34:26,871
Attachment leads
to jealousy.

297
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,416
The shadow of greed that is.

298
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:33,350
What must I do, Master Yoda?

299
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:36,479
Train yourself
to let go...

300
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:40,026
of everything
you fear to lose.

301
00:34:50,437 --> 00:34:53,167
You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.

302
00:34:54,608 --> 00:34:57,008
I'm sorry. I was held up.

303
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,705
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

304
00:35:00,814 --> 00:35:06,218
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

305
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:08,310
What's wrong, then?

306
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:11,015
The senate is expected...

307
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:14,616
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

308
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:19,097
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

309
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:21,599
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

310
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,668
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

311
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,240
Be careful of what?

312
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:31,970
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

313
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:36,708
- He would not say.
- He didn't inform the council?

314
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:40,274
- That's unusual, isn't it?
- All of this is unusual.

315
00:35:40,387 --> 00:35:42,821
And it's making me feel uneasy.

316
00:35:57,804 --> 00:35:59,704
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

317
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:01,933
Of course.

318
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:05,009
I need your help, son.

319
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:08,171
What do you mean?

320
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:13,480
- I'm depending on you.
- For what? I don't understand.

321
00:36:13,586 --> 00:36:19,149
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

322
00:36:19,259 --> 00:36:21,386
Anakin...

323
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:25,658
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

324
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:29,030
Me? A master?

325
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,537
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

326
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,535
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

327
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:41,136
I think they will.
They need you.

328
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:43,647
More than you know.

329
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:59,162
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

330
00:36:59,265 --> 00:37:02,666
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

331
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,428
I understand.

332
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:10,601
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

333
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,735
What?

334
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,213
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

335
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,448
It's unfair.

336
00:37:24,858 --> 00:37:28,089
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

337
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:31,686
Take a seat,
young Skywalker.

338
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,031
Forgive me, Master.

339
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,075
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...

340
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:46,907
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

341
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:49,777
Hiding in the outer rim
Grievous is.

342
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:52,977
The outlying systems
you must sweep.

343
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:55,316
We do not have
many ships to spare.

344
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:57,617
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?

345
00:37:57,724 --> 00:38:01,421
It is critical we send an attack group
there immediately.

346
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:04,929
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

347
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,393
Go I will.

348
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:11,493
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

349
00:38:11,604 --> 00:38:15,938
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

350
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,340
to reinforce
the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

351
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,504
May the Force
be with us all.

352
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:25,377
What kind of nonsense is this?

353
00:38:25,485 --> 00:38:27,919
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

354
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,717
It's never been done in the history of the Jedi.
It's insulting.

355
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,725
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

356
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:37,854
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

357
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:41,365
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

358
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:45,268
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

359
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:51,071
- I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on
the council. - But it's what you wanted.

360
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:54,510
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

361
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:56,514
That has nothing
to do with this.

362
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:59,551
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

363
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:02,644
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

364
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:05,781
- And?
- Anakin, I am on your side.

365
00:39:05,892 --> 00:39:09,157
- I didn't want to put you in this situation.
- What situation?

366
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:17,600
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

367
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,070
They want to know
what he's up to.

368
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:27,478
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

369
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:30,208
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

370
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:35,187
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

371
00:39:35,288 --> 00:39:37,722
This assignment
is not to be on record.

372
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:41,760
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

373
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:44,887
He befriended me.
He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

374
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:47,091
That is why
you must help us.

375
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,692
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader...

376
00:39:50,803 --> 00:39:54,500
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

377
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:56,575
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

378
00:39:56,676 --> 00:39:59,839
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

379
00:39:59,946 --> 00:40:04,508
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code...

380
00:40:04,617 --> 00:40:08,348
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

381
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:12,254
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

382
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:16,461
The council
is asking you.

383
00:40:23,403 --> 00:40:28,204
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

384
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,471
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

385
00:40:31,578 --> 00:40:33,910
I don't think
the boy can handle it.

386
00:40:34,013 --> 00:40:36,504
I don't trust him.

387
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:40,484
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

388
00:40:40,587 --> 00:40:44,284
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

389
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:47,257
So the prophecy says.

390
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,229
A prophecy
that misread could have been.

391
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,967
He will not let me down.

392
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:58,003
He never has.

393
00:40:58,104 --> 00:41:01,130
I hope right you are.

394
00:41:24,464 --> 00:41:29,834
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

395
00:41:29,936 --> 00:41:32,962
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

396
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:38,038
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

397
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:40,635
What do you mean?

398
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:45,343
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

399
00:41:45,451 --> 00:41:49,046
and the Republic has become
the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

400
00:41:49,155 --> 00:41:51,180
I don't believe that.

401
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:53,384
And you're sounding
like a separatist.

402
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:58,330
This war represents
a failure to listen.

403
00:41:58,431 --> 00:42:00,456
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

404
00:42:00,566 --> 00:42:03,831
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

405
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:06,461
Don't ask me to do that.

406
00:42:08,074 --> 00:42:11,703
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind ofa request belongs.

407
00:42:11,811 --> 00:42:14,609
- What is it?
- Nothing.

408
00:42:15,948 --> 00:42:19,782
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

409
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:24,220
Hold me.

410
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:27,452
Like you did
by the lake on Naboo.

411
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,360
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

412
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:34,900
No politics,
no plotting, no war.

413
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,473
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

414
00:43:17,577 --> 00:43:20,205
I have good news.

415
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:25,649
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

416
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:27,652
He's hiding
in the Utapau system.

417
00:43:27,754 --> 00:43:29,654
At last.

418
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:34,254
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

419
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,727
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

420
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:40,230
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

421
00:43:40,333 --> 00:43:43,666
You're the best
choice, by far.

422
00:43:45,104 --> 00:43:48,096
Hmm. Sit down.

423
00:43:48,207 --> 00:43:50,107
Leave us.

424
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:03,988
Anakin...

425
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:08,527
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

426
00:44:10,296 --> 00:44:14,494
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

427
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,693
I'm not sure
I understand.

428
00:44:16,803 --> 00:44:20,500
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

429
00:44:20,606 --> 00:44:23,973
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

430
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:27,869
They're planning
to betray me.

431
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:30,380
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

432
00:44:31,584 --> 00:44:33,484
Search your feelings.

433
00:44:35,688 --> 00:44:38,248
You know, don't you?

434
00:44:42,662 --> 00:44:45,756
- I know they don't trust you.
- Hmm. Or the senate.

435
00:44:45,865 --> 00:44:50,700
Or the Republic, or democracy,
for that matter.

436
00:44:50,803 --> 00:44:55,831
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

437
00:44:55,942 --> 00:44:57,910
Why?

438
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,504
They asked you
to do something...

439
00:45:01,614 --> 00:45:03,878
that made you feel dishonest,
didn't they?

440
00:45:06,919 --> 00:45:09,752
They asked you to spy
on me, didn't they?

441
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,795
I don't, uh...

442
00:45:16,896 --> 00:45:18,830
I don't know
what to say.

443
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:22,492
Remember back
to your early teachings.

444
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:26,902
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

445
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:31,670
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

446
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,904
Good is a point of view,
Anakin.

447
00:45:34,013 --> 00:45:39,178
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

448
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,984
including their quest
for greater power.

449
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,551
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

450
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:51,425
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

451
00:45:52,632 --> 00:45:54,862
And the Jedi don't?

452
00:45:54,967 --> 00:45:59,529
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

453
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:14,675
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

454
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:21,359
- No.
- I thought not.

455
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,860
It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

456
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:27,663
It's a Sith legend.

457
00:46:27,767 --> 00:46:29,667
Darth Plagueis...

458
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:35,435
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise...

459
00:46:35,541 --> 00:46:40,376
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

460
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:43,676
to create... Iife.

461
00:46:45,351 --> 00:46:48,377
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

462
00:46:48,487 --> 00:46:53,515
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

463
00:46:53,626 --> 00:46:55,526
from dying.

464
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:03,665
He could actually...
save people from death?

465
00:47:03,769 --> 00:47:09,036
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

466
00:47:09,141 --> 00:47:13,373
some consider to be unnatural.

467
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,345
Wh...What happened to him?

468
00:47:16,449 --> 00:47:19,509
He became so powerful...

469
00:47:20,786 --> 00:47:23,755
the only thing
he was afraid of was...

470
00:47:23,856 --> 00:47:25,756
Iosing his power.

471
00:47:25,858 --> 00:47:29,316
Which eventually,
of course, he did.

472
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:35,298
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

473
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:39,064
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

474
00:47:41,207 --> 00:47:43,107
It's ironic.

475
00:47:43,209 --> 00:47:45,234
He could save
others from death...

476
00:47:46,345 --> 00:47:48,438
but not himself.

477
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:55,143
Is it possible
to learn this power?

478
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:01,118
Not from a Jedi.

479
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:19,910
All Red units, over here!

480
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:34,789
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

481
00:48:34,894 --> 00:48:37,954
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

482
00:48:38,064 --> 00:48:41,192
- from the chairman of Utapau.
- Hmm.

483
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,030
Act on this we must.

484
00:48:44,136 --> 00:48:48,869
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

485
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:52,808
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.

486
00:48:52,912 --> 00:48:57,940
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

487
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,383
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

488
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:03,455
not the chancellor.

489
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:08,493
A master is needed,
with more experience.

490
00:49:08,594 --> 00:49:13,088
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.

491
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,565
- I agree.
- Aye.

492
00:49:15,668 --> 00:49:17,568
Aye.

493
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:21,367
Very well. Council adjourned.

494
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,173
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

495
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:35,743
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:49:47,967 --> 00:49:49,935
Charge!

497
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:06,784
Headfor cover!

498
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:25,268
- You're gonna need me on this one, Master.
- Oh, I agree.

499
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:29,467
- However, it may turn out just to
be a wild bantha chase. - Master.

500
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:36,746
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

501
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:41,252
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

502
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:43,719
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

503
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:50,757
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

504
00:50:50,863 --> 00:50:53,491
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

505
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,692
I have taught you
everything I know.

506
00:50:55,801 --> 00:50:59,532
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

507
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:02,334
But be patient, Anakin.

508
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:06,377
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

509
00:51:13,786 --> 00:51:17,051
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:17,156 --> 00:51:20,023
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

511
00:51:42,648 --> 00:51:47,210
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

512
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:51,380
- On the far side.
- I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

513
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,891
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

514
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:56,894
Very well.

515
00:51:56,996 --> 00:52:01,433
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

516
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:28,992
Save your energy.

517
00:52:29,094 --> 00:52:31,119
I can't.

518
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,993
Don't give up, Padmé.

519
00:52:46,478 --> 00:52:48,946
Obi-Wan's been here,
hasn't he?

520
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:51,073
He came by this morning.

521
00:52:52,484 --> 00:52:54,384
What did he want?

522
00:52:54,486 --> 00:52:56,420
He's worried about you.

523
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:02,860
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

524
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:05,726
I feel lost.

525
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:09,993
Lost? What do you mean?

526
00:53:11,937 --> 00:53:14,303
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

527
00:53:14,406 --> 00:53:17,807
They trust you
with their lives.

528
00:53:19,578 --> 00:53:21,637
Something's happening.

529
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:24,375
I'm not the Jedi
I should be.

530
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:28,652
I want more.

531
00:53:29,888 --> 00:53:31,788
And I know I shouldn't.

532
00:53:33,926 --> 00:53:35,894
You expect too much
of yourself.

533
00:53:39,865 --> 00:53:43,062
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

534
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:45,102
From my nightmares.

535
00:53:45,204 --> 00:53:47,138
Is that what's
bothering you?

536
00:53:48,173 --> 00:53:50,835
I won't lose you, Padmé.

537
00:53:50,943 --> 00:53:53,036
I'm not gonna die
in childbirth, Ani.

538
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:55,545
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

539
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,925
Greetings, young Jedi.

540
00:54:42,027 --> 00:54:45,463
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

541
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:47,498
Unfortunately, the war.

542
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,161
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

543
00:54:52,271 --> 00:54:55,468
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

544
00:54:55,574 --> 00:55:01,410
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

545
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:12,786
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

546
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:15,792
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

547
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:20,695
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

548
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,267
Tell your people
to take shelter.

549
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:26,337
If you have warriors,
now is the time.

550
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:41,447
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

551
00:55:43,422 --> 00:55:47,483
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

552
00:56:29,835 --> 00:56:35,068
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

553
00:56:37,676 --> 00:56:42,875
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

554
00:56:50,389 --> 00:56:52,721
It is a volcanic planet.

555
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:56,123
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

556
00:56:56,228 --> 00:57:00,221
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

557
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:04,769
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

558
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,805
Be thankful, Viceroy...

559
00:57:07,906 --> 00:57:10,807
you have not
found yourself in my grip.

560
00:57:14,313 --> 00:57:17,771
Your ship is waiting.

561
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:37,060
Hello there.

562
00:57:38,036 --> 00:57:43,303
General Kenobi.

563
00:57:43,408 --> 00:57:45,933
You are a bold one.

564
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:49,445
Kill him.

565
00:58:05,297 --> 00:58:07,424
Back away.

566
00:58:07,532 --> 00:58:11,468
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

567
00:58:11,570 --> 00:58:13,765
Your move.

568
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:15,772
You fool.

569
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:21,471
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

570
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:30,487
Attack, Kenobi.

571
00:59:46,865 --> 00:59:49,197
Army or not...

572
00:59:49,301 --> 00:59:54,398
you must realize
you are doomed.

573
00:59:54,506 --> 00:59:56,474
Oh, I don't think so.

574
01:00:54,032 --> 01:00:56,227
Cover that corner.

575
01:01:02,707 --> 01:01:04,766
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

576
01:01:04,876 --> 01:01:07,640
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

577
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:10,010
and we have begun our attack.

578
01:01:10,115 --> 01:01:12,515
Thank you, Commander.

579
01:01:12,617 --> 01:01:15,780
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

580
01:01:15,887 --> 01:01:18,447
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

581
01:01:18,557 --> 01:01:20,650
Yes, Master.

582
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:30,731
I sense a plot
to destroy the Jedi.

583
01:01:30,836 --> 01:01:33,464
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

584
01:01:33,572 --> 01:01:37,906
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction of Grievous...

585
01:01:38,009 --> 01:01:40,569
then he should be removed
from office.

586
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:44,342
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

587
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:46,576
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

588
01:01:46,685 --> 01:01:51,145
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

589
01:01:51,256 --> 01:01:56,888
Hmm. Great care
we must take.

590
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:05,095
Chancellor.

591
01:02:05,203 --> 01:02:07,728
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

592
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,501
He has engaged
General Grievous.

593
01:02:10,609 --> 01:02:13,942
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

594
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,775
I should be there with him.

595
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:20,242
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

596
01:02:20,345 --> 01:02:23,610
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

597
01:02:23,715 --> 01:02:27,811
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

598
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:31,489
I wish I knew.

599
01:02:32,824 --> 01:02:35,315
More and more I get
the feeling that...

600
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:37,657
I'm being excluded
from the council.

601
01:02:44,669 --> 01:02:48,571
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

602
01:02:50,842 --> 01:02:53,242
They don't trust you, Anakin.

603
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:56,006
They see your future.

604
01:02:56,114 --> 01:03:01,074
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

605
01:03:01,186 --> 01:03:06,920
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

606
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:12,389
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

607
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,261
How do you know the ways of the Force?

608
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:20,030
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

609
01:03:20,138 --> 01:03:23,107
Even the nature of
the dark side.

610
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,442
You know the dark side?

611
01:03:27,545 --> 01:03:29,979
Anakin...

612
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:33,380
if one is to understand
the great mystery...

613
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:36,045
one must study
all its aspects...

614
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:39,123
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

615
01:03:39,224 --> 01:03:43,024
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

616
01:03:43,128 --> 01:03:46,791
you must embrace a larger view
of the Force.

617
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:49,492
Be careful of the Jedi,
Anakin.

618
01:03:49,601 --> 01:03:51,796
Only through me...

619
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:55,771
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

620
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:59,173
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

621
01:03:59,277 --> 01:04:02,940
and you will be able to
save your wife...

622
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,072
from certain death.

623
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,117
What did you say?

624
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,848
Use my knowledge.
I beg you.

625
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,719
You're the Sith lord.

626
01:04:15,827 --> 01:04:19,695
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

627
01:04:19,797 --> 01:04:24,359
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

628
01:04:26,504 --> 01:04:29,962
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

629
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,634
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

630
01:04:32,744 --> 01:04:35,110
A life of significance...

631
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:37,579
of conscience.

632
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:45,985
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

633
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,491
I know you would.

634
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:53,394
I can feel your anger.

635
01:04:53,498 --> 01:04:56,194
It gives you focus...

636
01:04:56,301 --> 01:04:58,633
makes you stronger.

637
01:05:04,909 --> 01:05:09,039
- I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
- Of course. You should.

638
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:12,173
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

639
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:15,810
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

640
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,354
You have great wisdom,
Anakin.

641
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:22,085
Know the power
of the dark side.

642
01:05:22,193 --> 01:05:24,957
Power to save Padmé.

643
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,657
So uncivilized.

644
01:07:42,166 --> 01:07:44,191
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

645
01:07:44,302 --> 01:07:48,363
Skywalker, we just received word
that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

646
01:07:48,473 --> 01:07:52,409
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

647
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:56,241
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

648
01:07:56,347 --> 01:07:59,441
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

649
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:01,518
A Sith lord?

650
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,452
Yes. The one we've been
looking for.

651
01:08:04,555 --> 01:08:08,514
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

652
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,753
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

653
01:08:10,862 --> 01:08:13,660
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

654
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,363
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

655
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,926
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

656
01:08:21,038 --> 01:08:23,472
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

657
01:08:23,574 --> 01:08:25,872
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

658
01:08:25,977 --> 01:08:28,912
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

659
01:08:29,013 --> 01:08:31,777
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

660
01:08:31,883 --> 01:08:34,044
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

661
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,313
- I must go, Master.
- No.

662
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,290
If what you've
told me is true...

663
01:08:40,391 --> 01:08:42,291
you will have
gained my trust.

664
01:08:42,393 --> 01:08:44,918
But for now, remain here.

665
01:08:46,164 --> 01:08:48,962
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

666
01:08:50,301 --> 01:08:52,496
Yes, Master.

667
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:24,860
You do know, don't you...

668
01:09:24,969 --> 01:09:27,335
if the Jedi destroy me...

669
01:09:27,438 --> 01:09:31,397
any chance of saving her
will be lost.

670
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:04,768
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

671
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:08,134
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

672
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,868
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

673
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,910
you're under arrest,
Chancellor.

674
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:16,605
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

675
01:11:16,714 --> 01:11:18,648
The senate will decide
your fate.

676
01:11:18,749 --> 01:11:22,583
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

677
01:11:27,925 --> 01:11:30,257
It's treason then.

678
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:12,792
You are under arrest,
my lord.

679
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,491
Anakin, I told you
it would come to this.

680
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,227
I was right.

681
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,496
The Jedi are taking over.

682
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:23,072
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

683
01:13:23,174 --> 01:13:25,404
You have lost.

684
01:13:25,509 --> 01:13:27,477
No.

685
01:13:27,578 --> 01:13:31,173
No. No.
You will die!

686
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,844
He's a traitor!

687
01:13:35,953 --> 01:13:39,218
He is the traitor!

688
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:45,452
I have the power
to save the one you love.

689
01:13:45,563 --> 01:13:48,361
You must choose.

690
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:52,027
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

691
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:55,731
Don't let him kill me.

692
01:13:58,876 --> 01:14:01,572
I can't hold it any longer.

693
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,046
I...I...I...I can't.
I...I...I'm weak.

694
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,117
I'm...I'm too weak.

695
01:14:07,218 --> 01:14:08,651
Anakin.

696
01:14:08,753 --> 01:14:11,221
Help me. Help me!

697
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:17,918
I...I...I can't
hold on any longer.

698
01:14:18,028 --> 01:14:21,156
I am going to end this
once and for all.

699
01:14:21,265 --> 01:14:23,233
You can't.

700
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:25,268
He must stand trial.

701
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:28,770
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

702
01:14:28,873 --> 01:14:31,103
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

703
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:35,167
I'm too weak.
Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

704
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:37,179
It's not the Jedi way.

705
01:14:37,281 --> 01:14:38,805
He must live.

706
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:43,076
Please don't.

707
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,417
I need him.

708
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,753
- Please don't!
- No!

709
01:14:53,998 --> 01:14:56,523
Power!

710
01:15:01,438 --> 01:15:06,876
Unlimited power!

711
01:15:18,021 --> 01:15:20,051
What have I done?

712
01:15:28,332 --> 01:15:33,360
You're fulfilling
your destiny, Anakin.

713
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:36,200
Become my apprentice.

714
01:15:36,307 --> 01:15:41,745
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

715
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:47,384
I will do
whatever you ask.

716
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:51,982
Good.

717
01:15:53,691 --> 01:15:56,285
Just help me save
Padmé's life.

718
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,628
I can't live without her.

719
01:16:03,801 --> 01:16:08,204
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

720
01:16:08,305 --> 01:16:12,503
but if we work together...

721
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:16,410
I know we can discover
the secret.

722
01:16:17,848 --> 01:16:20,146
I pledge myself...

723
01:16:21,552 --> 01:16:24,578
to your teachings.

724
01:16:24,688 --> 01:16:26,713
Good.

725
01:16:26,824 --> 01:16:29,384
Good.

726
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:42,105
The Force is strong
with you.

727
01:16:42,206 --> 01:16:47,769
A powerful Sith
you will become.

728
01:16:47,878 --> 01:16:52,144
Henceforth
you shall be known as...

729
01:16:52,249 --> 01:16:54,877
Darth...

730
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:56,953
Vader.

731
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:04,117
thank you, my master.

732
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:08,298
Rise.

733
01:17:21,445 --> 01:17:26,382
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

734
01:17:27,952 --> 01:17:32,719
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

735
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:36,788
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

736
01:17:36,894 --> 01:17:38,862
they will kill us...

737
01:17:38,963 --> 01:17:41,591
along with all the senators.

738
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,667
I agree.

739
01:17:43,767 --> 01:17:47,362
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

740
01:17:47,471 --> 01:17:50,463
Every single Jedi...

741
01:17:50,574 --> 01:17:53,839
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

742
01:17:53,944 --> 01:17:57,505
is now an enemy
of the Republic.

743
01:17:58,549 --> 01:18:00,517
I understand, Master.

744
01:18:00,617 --> 01:18:03,211
We must move quickly.

745
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:05,288
The Jedi are relentless.

746
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:11,191
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

747
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:16,662
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

748
01:18:17,768 --> 01:18:20,871
We will catch them
off-balance.

749
01:18:20,871 --> 01:18:24,830
Do what must be done,
Lord Vader.

750
01:18:24,942 --> 01:18:28,935
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

751
01:18:29,046 --> 01:18:33,813
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

752
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:36,943
to save Padmé.

753
01:18:37,054 --> 01:18:40,922
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

754
01:18:41,025 --> 01:18:44,085
Their betrayal
will be dealt with.

755
01:18:45,996 --> 01:18:49,295
after you have killed all the Jedi
in the temple...

756
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,096
go to the Mustafar system.

757
01:18:52,202 --> 01:18:55,467
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

758
01:18:55,572 --> 01:18:59,008
and the other
separatist leaders.

759
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:05,014
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

760
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:08,150
And...

761
01:19:08,252 --> 01:19:13,019
we shall have... peace.

762
01:19:56,366 --> 01:19:59,199
Sergeant, over here!

763
01:19:59,303 --> 01:20:01,237
Hurry! Follow them!

764
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,900
All Red units,
let's move it!

765
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:07,909
Come on. Let's go!

766
01:20:21,792 --> 01:20:23,783
Commander, contact
your troops.

767
01:20:23,894 --> 01:20:25,862
Tell them to move to
the higher levels.

768
01:20:25,963 --> 01:20:27,863
Very good, sir.

769
01:20:27,965 --> 01:20:30,092
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

770
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,761
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

771
01:20:34,171 --> 01:20:35,771
 Yes, sir.

772
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,605
Commander Cody...

773
01:20:44,715 --> 01:20:48,048
the time has come.

774
01:20:48,152 --> 01:20:52,384
Execute order 66.

775
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:54,457
Yes, my lord.

776
01:20:58,929 --> 01:21:01,454
Blast him!

777
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:28,654
Come on!

778
01:22:18,742 --> 01:22:23,236
Execute order 66.

779
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:25,474
It will be done, my lord.

780
01:23:07,824 --> 01:23:10,088
It will be done, my lord.

781
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:49,064
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

782
01:23:49,166 --> 01:23:51,134
What are we going to do?

783
01:24:01,611 --> 01:24:05,775
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

784
01:24:05,882 --> 01:24:08,942
Don't worry. I...
I'm sure he'll be all right.

785
01:24:38,215 --> 01:24:41,275
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

786
01:24:41,385 --> 01:24:43,945
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

787
01:24:44,054 --> 01:24:47,285
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

788
01:24:49,025 --> 01:24:50,993
And so it is.

789
01:24:54,631 --> 01:24:57,293
Get him!

790
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:09,843
No!

791
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:16,008
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

792
01:25:42,946 --> 01:25:45,881
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

793
01:25:45,982 --> 01:25:47,950
Yes, sir.

794
01:25:55,559 --> 01:25:57,459
Good-bye, Tarfful.

795
01:25:57,561 --> 01:25:59,529
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

796
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:04,265
Miss you I will.

797
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,569
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

798
01:26:43,673 --> 01:26:46,039
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

799
01:26:51,715 --> 01:26:53,649
did you find Kenobi?

800
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,741
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

801
01:26:55,852 --> 01:26:59,151
Start loading your men on the ships.

802
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:02,020
Move it.

803
01:27:34,057 --> 01:27:36,048
Emergency code 91 3.

804
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:38,059
I have no contact
on any frequency.

805
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,223
Master Kenobi.

806
01:27:42,332 --> 01:27:44,323
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

807
01:27:44,434 --> 01:27:48,336
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

808
01:27:48,438 --> 01:27:51,032
We have just rescued
Master Yoda.

809
01:27:51,141 --> 01:27:53,473
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

810
01:27:53,577 --> 01:27:55,704
We're sending you
our coordinates.

811
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:05,354
Hush! Not so loud.

812
01:28:05,455 --> 01:28:08,481
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

813
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:11,060
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

814
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:14,688
- I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
- What's happening?

815
01:28:14,798 --> 01:28:17,665
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

816
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:20,327
I can't believe that.

817
01:28:20,437 --> 01:28:24,999
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

818
01:28:25,108 --> 01:28:28,566
Oh, Anakin.
What are you gonna do?

819
01:28:37,253 --> 01:28:39,448
I will not betray
the Republic.

820
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:44,427
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

821
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:47,257
and with the senate
and with you.

822
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,559
What about Obi-Wan?

823
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:51,896
I don't know.

824
01:28:52,002 --> 01:28:54,095
Many Jedi
have been killed.

825
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:58,004
We can only hope
that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

826
01:28:58,108 --> 01:29:00,474
Anakin, I'm afraid.

827
01:29:02,412 --> 01:29:05,540
Have faith, my love.

828
01:29:05,649 --> 01:29:07,947
Everything will soon
be set right.

829
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:11,452
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

830
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:14,751
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

831
01:29:14,858 --> 01:29:17,383
I'm going there
to end this war.

832
01:29:17,494 --> 01:29:19,394
Wait for me until I return.

833
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:21,862
Things will be different.
I promise.

834
01:29:27,704 --> 01:29:29,672
Please, wait for me.

835
01:29:33,743 --> 01:29:36,473
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

836
01:29:38,715 --> 01:29:40,615
Take care,
my little friend.

837
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:48,618
Oh, my lady, is there
anything I might do?

838
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:51,250
No, thank you, 3PO.

839
01:29:51,361 --> 01:29:56,060
Oh. I...
I feel so helpless.

840
01:30:18,922 --> 01:30:22,255
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

841
01:30:22,358 --> 01:30:25,691
Heard from no one
have we.

842
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,889
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

843
01:30:28,998 --> 01:30:30,898
That's why I went
looking for Yoda.

844
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,560
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

845
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:36,537
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

846
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,666
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

847
01:30:40,777 --> 01:30:44,213
- It says the war is over.
- Well, then we must go back.

848
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:47,806
If there are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

849
01:30:47,917 --> 01:30:52,752
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

850
01:30:52,856 --> 01:30:55,586
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

851
01:30:55,692 --> 01:30:58,252
I agree.

852
01:30:58,361 --> 01:31:01,956
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

853
01:31:22,952 --> 01:31:26,388
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

854
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:29,253
You have done well,
Viceroy.

855
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:35,195
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

856
01:31:35,298 --> 01:31:38,790
he will take care of you.

857
01:31:50,413 --> 01:31:53,541
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

858
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:55,618
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:31:57,353 --> 01:32:02,052
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

860
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:04,126
at a special session
of Congress.

861
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:07,754
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

862
01:32:10,767 --> 01:32:14,066
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

863
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:17,264
The chancellor will not be able
to control the thousands of star systems...

864
01:32:17,373 --> 01:32:19,273
without keeping
the senate intact.

865
01:32:19,375 --> 01:32:23,436
If a special session
of Congress there is...

866
01:32:23,546 --> 01:32:26,845
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

867
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:07,289
R2, stay with the ship.

868
01:33:32,015 --> 01:33:35,746
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

869
01:34:07,617 --> 01:34:12,111
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

870
01:34:12,221 --> 01:34:14,519
- What's happened?
- The chancellor's been elaborating...

871
01:34:14,624 --> 01:34:17,923
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

872
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:23,488
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

873
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:41,749
Not even the younglings
survived.

874
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,819
Killed not by clones...

875
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:48,152
this Padawan.

876
01:34:49,258 --> 01:34:51,886
By a lightsaber he was.

877
01:34:58,768 --> 01:35:02,329
Who? Who could have
done this?

878
01:35:13,049 --> 01:35:16,246
The attempt on my life...

879
01:35:16,352 --> 01:35:18,980
has left me scarred...

880
01:35:19,088 --> 01:35:22,080
and deformed.

881
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:25,092
But I assure you.

882
01:35:25,194 --> 01:35:29,893
My resolve
has never been stronger!

883
01:35:34,103 --> 01:35:35,971
Stop! No!

884
01:35:47,617 --> 01:35:51,280
In order to ensure
the security...

885
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:53,947
and continuing stability...

886
01:35:54,057 --> 01:35:57,959
the Republic
will be reorganized...

887
01:35:58,061 --> 01:36:03,499
into the first
Galactic Empire!

888
01:36:03,599 --> 01:36:05,624
For a safe...

889
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:10,263
and secure society.

890
01:36:19,682 --> 01:36:22,378
So this is how liberty dies.

891
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:25,181
With thunderous applause.

892
01:36:27,623 --> 01:36:29,818
The war is over.

893
01:36:29,926 --> 01:36:34,022
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

894
01:36:42,171 --> 01:36:46,870
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

895
01:36:46,976 --> 01:36:49,410
For the clones...

896
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:53,608
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

897
01:37:05,962 --> 01:37:08,021
Wait. Master.

898
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:11,294
There is something
I must know.

899
01:37:17,406 --> 01:37:19,874
If into the security
recordings you go...

900
01:37:19,976 --> 01:37:21,876
only pain will you find.

901
01:37:21,978 --> 01:37:25,414
I must know
the truth, Master.

902
01:37:32,321 --> 01:37:34,255
It can't be.

903
01:37:34,357 --> 01:37:36,257
It can't be.

904
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:40,420
You have done well,
my new apprentice.

905
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:43,522
Now, Lord Vader...

906
01:37:43,633 --> 01:37:47,160
go and bring peace
to the Empire.

907
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:49,431
I can't watch any more.

908
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:54,101
Destroy the Sith we must.

909
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:58,005
Send me to kill
the emperor.

910
01:37:58,114 --> 01:38:00,412
I will not kill Anakin.

911
01:38:00,516 --> 01:38:05,249
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

912
01:38:05,354 --> 01:38:08,585
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

913
01:38:08,691 --> 01:38:14,425
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

914
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:17,931
The boy you trained,
gone he is.

915
01:38:18,034 --> 01:38:20,935
Consumed by Darth Vader.

916
01:38:21,037 --> 01:38:24,029
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

917
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,370
I don't know where to look.

918
01:38:27,677 --> 01:38:31,374
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

919
01:38:41,924 --> 01:38:44,518
When was the last time
you saw him?

920
01:38:44,627 --> 01:38:47,994
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

921
01:38:49,098 --> 01:38:51,066
No.

922
01:38:51,167 --> 01:38:54,762
Padmé, I need your help.

923
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:57,862
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

924
01:38:57,974 --> 01:38:59,942
From himself.

925
01:39:02,378 --> 01:39:04,471
Padmé...

926
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:06,980
Anakin has turned
to the dark side.

927
01:39:07,083 --> 01:39:10,519
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

928
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:17,156
I have seen a...
a security hologram...

929
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,694
of him...

930
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:21,695
killing younglings.

931
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:24,823
Not Anakin.
He couldn't.

932
01:39:24,934 --> 01:39:27,903
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

933
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:32,498
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

934
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:37,073
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

935
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:41,275
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

936
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:49,458
I don't believe you.

937
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:52,828
I can't.

938
01:39:57,933 --> 01:40:00,424
Padmé...

939
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:02,800
I must find him.

940
01:40:04,907 --> 01:40:07,273
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

941
01:40:10,946 --> 01:40:13,437
He has become
a very great threat.

942
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:18,020
I can't.

943
01:40:31,233 --> 01:40:33,167
Anakin is the father,
isn't he?

944
01:40:36,972 --> 01:40:39,805
I'm so sorry.

945
01:41:25,354 --> 01:41:27,015
Milady, let me come with you.

946
01:41:27,123 --> 01:41:29,887
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

947
01:41:29,992 --> 01:41:32,392
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

948
01:41:32,495 --> 01:41:36,158
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

949
01:41:36,265 --> 01:41:38,631
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

950
01:41:40,503 --> 01:41:42,471
Oh, dear.

951
01:41:53,115 --> 01:41:55,208
Do you know?

952
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:58,912
I think I'm beginning to get
the hang of this flying business. Hmm.

953
01:42:26,315 --> 01:42:29,751
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

954
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:32,753
It is finished then.

955
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:39,958
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

956
01:42:40,062 --> 01:42:44,965
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

957
01:42:45,067 --> 01:42:50,232
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

958
01:42:50,339 --> 01:42:52,398
Very good, my lord.

959
01:43:52,368 --> 01:43:54,427
I saw your ship.

960
01:43:57,273 --> 01:44:00,265
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

961
01:44:01,744 --> 01:44:04,611
Obi-Wan told me
terrible things.

962
01:44:04,713 --> 01:44:06,840
What things?

963
01:44:06,949 --> 01:44:09,884
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

964
01:44:09,985 --> 01:44:12,385
That you...

965
01:44:12,488 --> 01:44:14,615
killed younglings.

966
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:18,854
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

967
01:44:18,961 --> 01:44:22,727
- He cares about us.
- Us?

968
01:44:22,831 --> 01:44:25,561
He knows.

969
01:44:25,668 --> 01:44:27,568
He wants to help you.

970
01:44:30,673 --> 01:44:34,666
Anakin, all I want
is your love.

971
01:44:34,777 --> 01:44:37,109
Love won't save you, Padmé.

972
01:44:37,212 --> 01:44:40,477
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

973
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,983
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

974
01:44:43,085 --> 01:44:45,815
I won't lose you the way
I lost my mother.

975
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:50,153
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

976
01:44:50,259 --> 01:44:53,057
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

977
01:44:54,363 --> 01:44:56,331
Come away with me.

978
01:44:56,432 --> 01:44:59,094
Help me raise our child.

979
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:03,433
- Leave everything else behind while we still can.
- Don't you see?

980
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:06,770
We don't have to
run away anymore.

981
01:45:06,875 --> 01:45:09,400
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

982
01:45:09,511 --> 01:45:12,378
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

983
01:45:12,481 --> 01:45:14,574
I...I can overthrow him.

984
01:45:16,652 --> 01:45:19,712
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

985
01:45:19,822 --> 01:45:22,222
make things the way
we want them to be.

986
01:45:28,564 --> 01:45:30,555
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

987
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:35,366
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

988
01:45:37,573 --> 01:45:40,440
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

989
01:45:40,542 --> 01:45:44,706
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

990
01:45:46,415 --> 01:45:48,406
I don't know you anymore.

991
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:52,020
Anakin...

992
01:45:52,121 --> 01:45:54,715
you're breaking my heart.

993
01:45:54,823 --> 01:45:57,792
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

994
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,657
Because of Obi-Wan?

995
01:46:00,763 --> 01:46:03,561
Because of what you've done.

996
01:46:03,666 --> 01:46:05,566
What you plan to do.

997
01:46:06,802 --> 01:46:09,464
Stop. Stop now.
Come back.

998
01:46:09,571 --> 01:46:12,506
- I love you.
- Liar!

999
01:46:15,377 --> 01:46:17,242
No.

1000
01:46:17,346 --> 01:46:21,077
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1001
01:46:21,183 --> 01:46:24,118
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1002
01:46:25,688 --> 01:46:27,246
Anakin.

1003
01:46:27,356 --> 01:46:29,517
Let her go.

1004
01:46:39,501 --> 01:46:41,526
You turned her against me!

1005
01:46:43,138 --> 01:46:45,333
You have done that yourself.

1006
01:46:50,079 --> 01:46:52,274
You will not
take her from me!

1007
01:46:52,381 --> 01:46:56,215
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1008
01:46:59,388 --> 01:47:04,519
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now-

1009
01:47:06,095 --> 01:47:09,258
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1010
01:47:09,364 --> 01:47:11,298
Don't lecture me,
Obi-Wan.

1011
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,891
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

1012
01:47:15,003 --> 01:47:17,403
I do not fear the dark side
as you do.

1013
01:47:19,241 --> 01:47:21,175
I have brought peace...

1014
01:47:21,276 --> 01:47:22,971
freedom, justice...

1015
01:47:23,078 --> 01:47:26,912
and security
to my new empire.

1016
01:47:27,015 --> 01:47:29,882
Your new empire?

1017
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:33,318
Don't make me kill you.

1018
01:47:33,422 --> 01:47:37,916
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1019
01:47:38,026 --> 01:47:40,620
If you're not with me...

1020
01:47:41,663 --> 01:47:43,563
then you're my enemy.

1021
01:47:45,567 --> 01:47:48,058
Only a Sith
deals in absolutes.

1022
01:47:50,672 --> 01:47:53,072
I will do what I must.

1023
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:55,575
You will try.

1024
01:48:27,342 --> 01:48:31,369
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1025
01:48:31,480 --> 01:48:35,940
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1026
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:38,281
Master Yoda.

1027
01:48:38,387 --> 01:48:40,446
You survived.

1028
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,286
Surprised?

1029
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:47,988
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1030
01:48:48,096 --> 01:48:50,155
Now you will experience...

1031
01:48:50,265 --> 01:48:54,725
the full power
of the dark side.

1032
01:49:36,678 --> 01:49:40,375
I have waited a long time...

1033
01:49:40,482 --> 01:49:43,042
for this moment...

1034
01:49:43,151 --> 01:49:47,679
my little green friend.

1035
01:49:56,732 --> 01:50:01,362
At last the Jedi are no more.

1036
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:05,702
Not if anything to say about it I have.

1037
01:50:10,312 --> 01:50:13,372
At an end your rule is.

1038
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:17,684
And not short enough it was.

1039
01:50:21,623 --> 01:50:24,649
If so powerful you are...

1040
01:50:25,928 --> 01:50:28,226
why leave?

1041
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,890
You will not stop me.

1042
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:35,595
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1043
01:50:35,704 --> 01:50:40,073
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1044
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:45,437
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1045
01:55:13,081 --> 01:55:15,811
Hurry. Careful timing
we will need.

1046
01:55:15,917 --> 01:55:18,715
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1047
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:21,186
There's no sign
of his body, sir.

1048
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:24,952
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1049
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:27,290
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

1050
01:55:27,395 --> 01:55:32,492
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1051
01:55:32,601 --> 01:55:37,664
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1052
01:56:46,508 --> 01:56:50,274
Into exile I must go.

1053
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:52,471
Failed I have.

1054
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:33,848
I have failed you, Anakin.

1055
01:58:33,948 --> 01:58:35,848
I have failed you.

1056
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:38,851
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1057
01:58:38,953 --> 01:58:41,751
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1058
01:58:41,856 --> 01:58:44,518
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1059
01:58:44,626 --> 01:58:46,184
Well, then you are lost!

1060
01:58:58,072 --> 01:59:00,597
This is the end for you,
my master.

1061
01:59:25,133 --> 01:59:29,229
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1062
01:59:30,905 --> 01:59:33,601
You underestimate my power.

1063
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:36,074
Don't try it.

1064
01:59:58,166 --> 02:00:00,930
You were the chosen one!

1065
02:00:02,437 --> 02:00:05,634
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

1066
02:00:08,276 --> 02:00:10,335
Bring balance
to the Force...

1067
02:00:10,445 --> 02:00:12,970
not leave it in darkness!

1068
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:26,090
I hate you!

1069
02:00:33,535 --> 02:00:35,799
You were my brother, Anakin.

1070
02:00:37,872 --> 02:00:40,204
I loved you.

1071
02:01:20,081 --> 02:01:22,049
Oh. Master Kenobi.

1072
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:24,414
Um, we have
Miss Padmé on board.

1073
02:01:24,519 --> 02:01:27,044
Yes. Please,
please hurry.

1074
02:01:27,155 --> 02:01:29,316
We should leave
this dreadful place.

1075
02:01:41,369 --> 02:01:43,337
Obi-Wan.

1076
02:01:44,872 --> 02:01:47,067
Is Anakin all right?

1077
02:02:55,677 --> 02:02:58,475
Your Majesty, this way.

1078
02:02:58,579 --> 02:03:00,479
There he is.

1079
02:03:00,581 --> 02:03:02,742
He's still alive.

1080
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:07,983
Get a medical capsule
immediately.

1081
02:03:08,089 --> 02:03:10,057
Yes, sir. Right away.

1082
02:03:45,259 --> 02:03:47,955
Excuse me,
Master Yoda.

1083
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:56,062
Obi-Wan Kenobi
has made contact.

1084
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:15,320
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1085
02:04:44,886 --> 02:04:47,878
Medically,
she's completely healthy.

1086
02:04:47,989 --> 02:04:51,186
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1087
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,290
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1088
02:04:55,396 --> 02:04:57,455
She has lost
the will to live.

1089
02:04:57,565 --> 02:05:00,728
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1090
02:05:00,835 --> 02:05:02,427
Babies?

1091
02:05:02,537 --> 02:05:04,402
She's carrying twins.

1092
02:05:44,045 --> 02:05:46,479
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1093
02:05:46,581 --> 02:05:49,345
Luke.

1094
02:05:56,257 --> 02:05:59,784
Oh, Luke.

1095
02:06:03,364 --> 02:06:07,630
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1096
02:06:17,144 --> 02:06:20,113
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1097
02:06:20,214 --> 02:06:23,149
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1098
02:07:05,126 --> 02:07:07,754
Obi-Wan?

1099
02:07:11,999 --> 02:07:13,899
There's good in him.

1100
02:07:16,604 --> 02:07:18,538
I know.

1101
02:07:18,639 --> 02:07:21,233
I know there's...

1102
02:07:21,342 --> 02:07:23,310
still...

1103
02:07:57,511 --> 02:08:00,207
Lord Vader.

1104
02:08:00,314 --> 02:08:02,407
Can you hear me?

1105
02:08:05,453 --> 02:08:07,921
Yes, Master.

1106
02:08:10,057 --> 02:08:12,890
Where is Padmé?

1107
02:08:12,994 --> 02:08:15,656
Is she safe?

1108
02:08:16,764 --> 02:08:18,755
Is she all right?

1109
02:08:20,501 --> 02:08:25,029
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1110
02:08:26,073 --> 02:08:28,974
I? I couldn't have.

1111
02:08:29,076 --> 02:08:32,068
She was alive.
I felt it!

1112
02:08:51,866 --> 02:08:56,166
No!

1113
02:09:06,047 --> 02:09:10,677
Hidden, safe
the children must be kept.

1114
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:15,017
We must take them somewhere
where the Sith will not sense their presence.

1115
02:09:16,123 --> 02:09:20,059
Hmm. Split up
they should be.

1116
02:09:20,161 --> 02:09:22,288
My wife and I
will take the girl.

1117
02:09:23,864 --> 02:09:26,799
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1118
02:09:26,901 --> 02:09:29,131
She will be loved with us.

1119
02:09:29,236 --> 02:09:32,034
And what of the boy?

1120
02:09:32,139 --> 02:09:36,473
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1121
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,746
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1122
02:09:45,453 --> 02:09:49,890
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1123
02:09:51,692 --> 02:09:55,287
Master Kenobi,
wait a moment.

1124
02:09:56,831 --> 02:10:02,030
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1125
02:10:02,136 --> 02:10:04,696
Training?

1126
02:10:04,805 --> 02:10:09,367
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1127
02:10:11,445 --> 02:10:14,539
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1128
02:10:14,648 --> 02:10:17,139
Your old master.

1129
02:10:17,251 --> 02:10:19,242
Qui-Gon?

1130
02:10:21,755 --> 02:10:25,020
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1131
02:10:26,527 --> 02:10:28,688
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1132
02:10:28,796 --> 02:10:30,696
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1133
02:10:30,798 --> 02:10:32,698
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1134
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:34,700
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1135
02:10:34,802 --> 02:10:36,269
What?

1136
02:10:38,139 --> 02:10:40,107
Oh, no.

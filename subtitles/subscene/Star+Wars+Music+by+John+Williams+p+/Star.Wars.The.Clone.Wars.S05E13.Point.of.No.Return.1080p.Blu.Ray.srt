1
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,673
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

2
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,443
<i>Colonel Gascon and his droid squad</i>

3
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,945
<i>steal an encryption module</i>

4
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,614
<i>needed to crack a Separatist code</i>

5
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:29,784
<i>and stop an impending attack
on the Republic.</i>

6
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:31,319
<i>After surviving The Void</i>

7
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:34,155
<i>and escaping the hostile planet
of Abafar,</i>

8
00:00:34,223 --> 00:00:38,295
<i>our heroes finally appear to be
headed in the right direction.</i>

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,639
Hmm, looks like the Jedi cruiser

10
00:00:46,706 --> 00:00:48,542
is expecting this shuttle.

11
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:50,678
Well, I'm sure there's someone aboard

12
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:54,550
who can put this encryption
module to good use.

13
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:57,421
Well, soldiers, this is the end
of the mission.

14
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,858
Colonel Gascon has succeeded.

15
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:01,593
R2, contact the bridge.

16
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,464
Tell them I request a meal
with the captain.

17
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:08,069
Nothing too fancy,
and, uh, I don't eat bantha.

18
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:12,475
What do you mean you still
can't make contact?

19
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:15,212
I have got a bad feeling
about this, Colonel.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,683
Something is not right.

21
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,291
<i>Snogwash!</i>

22
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,694
It's probably just the effects
of The Void.

23
00:01:26,762 --> 00:01:29,231
All that, uh, magnetic disruption

24
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,134
messed up his circuitry.

25
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,309
I will not allow your frivolous worrying

26
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:40,947
to undermine this...
this glorious moment!

27
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:42,850
I expect a hero's welcome,

28
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,321
not to mention my inevitable promotion

29
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:47,591
to P1 Brigadier!

30
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,389
Wow.

31
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,259
They really went overboard
on the welcoming committee.

32
00:02:14,863 --> 00:02:16,631
Good question, QT.

33
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:20,170
Why are there not any other
shuttles or crew members?

34
00:02:20,238 --> 00:02:24,475
Well, everyone's probably
preparing to, uh...

35
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:25,864
Well, they'll all want to be there

36
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:28,213
when we break the Separatist code.

37
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:33,854
How should I know why
all the blast doors are shut?

38
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,957
That's a question
for the captain of this ship

39
00:02:36,025 --> 00:02:40,263
and one I intend to ask
just as soon as I find him.

40
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,740
Sergeant, Colonel Meebur Gascon.

41
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:51,043
You have no doubt been expecting me.

42
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,247
I am delivering the Separatist
encryption module.

43
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,651
Why... it's just a hologram.

44
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:11,403
What in the blazes is going on here?

45
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,776
I do not know.

46
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:17,745
But we just made the jump to hyperspace,

47
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:21,350
which means somebody
is navigating this ship.

48
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,166
You, droids!

49
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:36,236
What are you doing on our ship?

50
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:39,107
Surrender or you will be destroyed.

51
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,175
Battle droids!

52
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:43,880
Whoo... ahh!

53
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,057
The commander wants the detonator

54
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,127
taken to the control room.

55
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:55,328
Roger, roger.

56
00:03:56,832 --> 00:03:57,999
Okay, let me just...

57
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,069
Lift with your legs!
Lift with your legs!

58
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:01,504
Uh, heavy, heavy.

59
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:03,774
Watch it, watch it!
Look out!

60
00:04:03,841 --> 00:04:05,409
Good thinking back there.

61
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:08,947
But next time <i>I</i> give the orders.
Understood?

62
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,317
I got it.

63
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,985
I got it.

64
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,220
I don't got it!

65
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:15,288
Yaah!

66
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:18,292
Uh-oh.

67
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:24,833
I wasn't programmed for this.

68
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,539
Stop!
Which way are we going?

69
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:31,911
Down here!

70
00:04:34,415 --> 00:04:35,583
Aah!

71
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,663
Have you seen the intruders?

72
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,366
They went that way?

73
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,600
Roger, roger.

74
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:56,310
All right, something
very strange is going on here.

75
00:04:56,378 --> 00:05:00,548
It appears this ship has been
hijacked by Separatists.

76
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:05,922
What do you mean it doesn't belong here?

77
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,390
He is right, Colonel.

78
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,927
This is not Republic technology.

79
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,764
Not unless they have lowered
their standards.

80
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:15,635
Well, what exactly do you think it is?

81
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:18,538
A bomb?

82
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:20,208
What kind of a bomb?
Is it on?

83
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:22,510
How long do we have?
Talk to me!

84
00:05:25,615 --> 00:05:28,017
What do you mean the ship is a bomb?

85
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,921
How can the entire ship be a bomb?

86
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:45,506
Mother of Kwath...

87
00:05:45,574 --> 00:05:48,177
There must be enough rhydonium in here

88
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,815
to blow up the entire Republic fleet.

89
00:06:02,068 --> 00:06:03,735
I don't know what any of this means,

90
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:06,672
but I want off this ship immediately.

91
00:06:08,944 --> 00:06:11,580
My mission is over.

92
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:15,085
I had no orders to stop
Separatist piracy

93
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:18,590
or disarm massive,
titanic-scale bombs!

94
00:06:20,527 --> 00:06:22,194
C4 has a good point.

95
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:24,631
If we do not stop this ship
before it explodes,

96
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:27,201
it could cost the Republic
thousands of lives.

97
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:29,171
Pure speculation.

98
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:32,875
We're evacuating this ship,
and that is an order!

99
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,083
Oh, right.

100
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,185
We'll have to wait to evacuate

101
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,556
until the ship is out of hyperspace.

102
00:06:42,623 --> 00:06:44,826
By then it could be too late.

103
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,797
Once we get where we are going,
my guess is...

104
00:06:47,864 --> 00:06:49,132
kaboom!

105
00:07:03,786 --> 00:07:04,786
Wait!

106
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:06,789
I...

107
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,258
no...

108
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:10,160
okay, okay!

109
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,706
I don't know, QT.

110
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,975
Where is R2 gone now?

111
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:27,749
What's going on?
Who is this?

112
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:32,890
I am BNI-393,
an LEP Servant Droid.

113
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,261
My master called me Bunny.

114
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,798
And where is your master?

115
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,132
He was killed

116
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,636
when the Separatists
took control of this ship.

117
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,072
Why were you hiding from us?

118
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,676
At first I did not know
if I could trust you.

119
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:49,079
Then I was not sure
you would believe me.

120
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:50,981
Once you saw the truth,

121
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,418
I was simply hoping
you would abandon ship

122
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,821
and take the rest of us with you.

123
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:56,889
Rest of you?

124
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,023
You're telling me

125
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,126
there's more
Republic crew members on board?

126
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,901
Did you destroy the intruders?

127
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,170
Uh, no.

128
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,472
There are Republic droids on this ship

129
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,308
that could ruin our plans.

130
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:17,615
You will search the entire ship
until the intruders are found

131
00:08:17,683 --> 00:08:19,751
and report back to me.

132
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,441
Is this a joke?

133
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,278
The rest of the crew is in our shuttle?

134
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,548
I told them to wait inside

135
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,850
and that we would be leaving

136
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,454
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

137
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:56,834
You can come out now.

138
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,135
It is okay.

139
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:08,684
These are the other crew members?

140
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:09,985
As you can see,

141
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:12,389
none of us can pilot the shuttle,

142
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:14,325
which is why we needed you.

143
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:15,826
Why you need <i>me</i>.

144
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:16,894
Hi, there.

145
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:17,896
I am the pilot.

146
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,401
What is this Separatist plot?

147
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:22,870
I do not know the details.

148
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,306
I was only able to steal the coordinates

149
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:26,374
of their target.

150
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:27,742
Target?

151
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:32,649
You mean they aren't just
planning to blow up this ship?

152
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:34,118
I do not believe so.

153
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:36,488
The coordinates are a space station

154
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:38,124
in the Carida system.

155
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,191
What?

156
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,192
That's the site

157
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,162
of the Republic Strategy Conference.

158
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:45,900
How do I know?

159
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:47,469
I was putting the finishing touches

160
00:09:47,537 --> 00:09:49,639
on a report for that conference

161
00:09:49,706 --> 00:09:52,343
when I was assigned this mission.

162
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,044
The Jedi Council will be there,

163
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:57,282
along with Republic officers
from around the galaxy and...

164
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,751
What the...

165
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,289
The Separatists are going to ram
the station with this ship!

166
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,059
I agree.

167
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,062
We have to do something, R2.

168
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:08,931
See if you can send a transmission

169
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,967
to the Republic so we can warn them.

170
00:10:11,035 --> 00:10:12,269
It is no use.

171
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:13,805
We have tried that.

172
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,009
All transmissions from this ship
are being blocked.

173
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:20,113
Hmm, you're right.

174
00:10:20,181 --> 00:10:22,283
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

175
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:27,956
Where's he going?

176
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:29,023
Uh-oh.

177
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,193
That buzz droid is not with me.

178
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,329
It must be a spy!

179
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:36,166
Stop that droid!

180
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,259
Where'd he go?
We've got to find him.

181
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:21,761
I do not know.
I do not see him anywhere.

182
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,966
Uh, Colonel...

183
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:26,636
I think I see him.

184
00:11:26,703 --> 00:11:29,539
I think I see a whole lot of him.

185
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:30,940
It's a trap!

186
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,647
Good work.
You've established a perimeter.

187
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:03,318
There are still more coming!

188
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,829
Please tell me you have
a brilliant strategy, Colonel!

189
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,099
I don't know!
There's just so many of them.

190
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,969
What do you mean, "get out"?

191
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,976
All right, what are you going to do?

192
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:24,879
You are going to open the air lock?

193
00:12:24,947 --> 00:12:26,515
Are you crazy, BZ?

194
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,835
Everybody, magnetize your feet!

195
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,003
Lock down!

196
00:12:45,608 --> 00:12:47,244
BZ!
Magnetize!

197
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:49,047
Magnetize!

198
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,148
No!

199
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,964
R2, close the door!

200
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,733
Close the door!

201
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,815
Poor BZ.

202
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:19,352
You will be missed, soldier.

203
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:21,888
R2 is right.

204
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,929
Colonel, would you say something
to honor this heroic sacrifice?

205
00:13:26,996 --> 00:13:29,532
I suppose that's appropriate.

206
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,636
I'll have to make it quick
because we don't have much time.

207
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:35,040
When this D-Squad
started our mission,

208
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:36,608
I had doubts.

209
00:13:36,676 --> 00:13:39,145
Grave doubts that we would ever survive,

210
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:41,048
let alone succeed.

211
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:42,984
But we worked together.

212
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,419
We didn't give up hope.

213
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:47,022
We showed courage in the face of death.

214
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,992
It shocks me to say this,

215
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,096
but we make an excellent team.

216
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,866
Now we've lost one of our members...

217
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,168
BZ.

218
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,938
But we must remember.

219
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,576
BZ sacrificed himself for us.

220
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:04,913
That's what a good soldier does
sometimes.

221
00:14:04,981 --> 00:14:07,550
The only way to honor that sacrifice

222
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,319
is to stop this ship

223
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,088
and prevent the Separatists

224
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:13,592
from taking any more Republic lives.

225
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,660
Are you with me?

226
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,053
Have the buzz droids
reported back in yet?

227
00:14:25,186 --> 00:14:27,889
No, there has been no signal from them.

228
00:14:27,956 --> 00:14:31,260
In fact, I cannot even locate
their signal anymore.

229
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,561
We must assume, then,

230
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:34,665
that the buzz droids have failed.

231
00:14:34,732 --> 00:14:38,437
I want those intruders found
before they ruin our plans.

232
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,706
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

233
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:46,848
All right, everybody knows the plan?

234
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,052
We get the injured droids to the shuttle

235
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,420
and distract the battle droids

236
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:52,757
while R2 goes up to the detonator

237
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,894
and programs it to explode early.

238
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,929
Hopefully he can make it
back to the shuttle

239
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:59,933
and we can all get off the ship
before it blows up.

240
00:15:01,503 --> 00:15:03,806
Good luck, R2.

241
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,212
The intruders!
Destroy them!

242
00:15:25,103 --> 00:15:26,236
You can make it!

243
00:15:26,304 --> 00:15:28,306
Hurry!
Hurry!

244
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:51,702
We have our target in sight.

245
00:15:51,771 --> 00:15:53,172
Full ahead.

246
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,308
Ramming speed.

247
00:15:55,376 --> 00:15:57,811
Evacuation plan is now under way.

248
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,183
I will go to the detonator
and start the countdown.

249
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,287
The worst part about our job

250
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,569
are these boring strategy conferences.

251
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:18,905
Cheer up, Anakin.

252
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:20,973
This is your chance to voice
all your complaints

253
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:22,809
about military protocol.

254
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,846
And it looks as though
we can finally get under way.

255
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:29,218
I will inform Master Windu
the last straggler has arrived

256
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:31,955
while you work on your attitude.

257
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,898
Isn't that ship coming in
a little too fast?

258
00:16:42,537 --> 00:16:43,705
There's the shuttle!

259
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:52,850
Careful, you'll hit the rhydonium.

260
00:16:52,918 --> 00:16:54,753
Everyone, head to the ship!

261
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,857
C4 and I will distract them.

262
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,281
You are too late.

263
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,122
Once the detonation sequence
has commenced,

264
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,090
there is no stopping it.

265
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,501
Now let's see if R2 made it
to the detonator.

266
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:40,547
R2 is in trouble!

267
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:41,615
Come on!

268
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:47,589
R2 will never make it back
to the shuttle in time.

269
00:17:47,657 --> 00:17:50,393
We've got to delay the launch.

270
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:55,233
The cruiser has not slowed its pace.

271
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:57,369
Have you been able to contact
their captain?

272
00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:01,075
Z9 says he cannot make contact
with anyone.

273
00:18:01,143 --> 00:18:04,447
Where's R2 when I need him?

274
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,662
We've got to regroup
and head back for R2.

275
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,766
Well, we're changing the plan!

276
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,401
No one gets left behind,

277
00:18:21,469 --> 00:18:24,405
and we're not leaving until I say so!

278
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:26,441
Prepare for liftoff!

279
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,738
No.
It is too soon.

280
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,675
We are scanning a large amount
of rhydonium on that ship!

281
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:54,944
It's a bomb.

282
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,563
And you thought
this conference would be boring.

283
00:19:39,037 --> 00:19:40,071
Mayday! Mayday!

284
00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:41,539
Space station Valor,

285
00:19:41,607 --> 00:19:43,542
this is Colonel Meebur Gascon.

286
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,612
Can anyone hear me?

287
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:46,779
We read you, Colonel.

288
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:48,315
This is General Skywalker.

289
00:19:48,383 --> 00:19:49,717
What's going on out there?

290
00:19:49,785 --> 00:19:52,288
Slight change in our mission, General.

291
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:55,358
The droids and I were stowaways
on that cruiser.

292
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:56,793
Where's R2?

293
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,330
I'm sorry to report he was on that ship

294
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,932
when it blew up, sir.

295
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,369
He just saved all your lives.

296
00:20:03,437 --> 00:20:06,340
I want a salvage team out there now!

297
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:07,408
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:38,683 --> 00:20:40,184
R2!

299
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:44,823
You made it, buddy!

300
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:46,693
Hey, you're a big hero.

301
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,136
There's someone here
who wants to speak to you.

302
00:20:57,644 --> 00:21:01,514
R2D2, are we glad to see you.

303
00:21:01,582 --> 00:21:03,083
I am most glad.

304
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,219
Quiet, WAC.
I'm talking here.

305
00:21:05,287 --> 00:21:06,422
Yes, sir, Colonel.

306
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:12,329
In truth, I might just be a map reader,

307
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,700
and I don't have much battle experience,

308
00:21:15,768 --> 00:21:16,935
but, R2,

309
00:21:17,003 --> 00:21:20,706
you are the bravest droid
I have ever met.

310
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:22,176
You all are.

311
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:25,113
I would be proud to serve
with you droids

312
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,015
anytime, anywhere.

313
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,752
Oh, I am glad to hear you
say that, Colonel,

314
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,191
because I hear we have been
assigned to the same platoon!

315
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,493
We will be seeing each other every day

316
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:37,563
for the rest of the war!

317
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,300
That's great, WAC.

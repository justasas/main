1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,606
As the Clone War scorches
its destructive path across the galaxy,

2
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:26,068
it is the Jedi who bring order to the chaos.

3
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,780
Though as the war progresses,
the number of Jedi have declined,

4
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,491
and new younglings are harder to find.

5
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:35,994
When a youngling is located,
they are brought to the Jedi Temple

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:40,123
and learn quickly
that their true family is now the Jedi Order.

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,585
The trials are hard, tests must be passed,

8
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,630
but none is as important as The Gathering.

9
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,134
It is then that a Jedi's path will truly begin.

10
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,139
Hurry, younglings.

11
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,270
You have proved to be
the top of your class,

12
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,439
and so now is the time of The Gathering.

13
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,026
For a Jedi,
there is no greater challenge or honor.

14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,157
What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano?

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,618
Petro,

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,370
Ganodi,

17
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,663
Byph,

18
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,039
Katooni,

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,791
Zatt,

20
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:24,334
and Gungi,

21
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,338
the time has come
for you to build your own lightsabers.

22
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,048
- I knew it!
- That's so wizard!

23
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,009
- Whoa!
- I knew it!

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,139
Be warned, this is no simple task,
and many perils lie ahead of you.

25
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:42,186
Where we are going,
there is no place more sacred to the Jedi.

26
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,389
Not the most hospitable place.

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,558
I think that's the point.

28
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,287
It's a dead end.

29
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:49,545
Younglings, outstretch your hands
and focus the Force.

30
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,215
Together, and only together, can we enter.

31
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:34,006
Now hurry. The sun has already risen,
and we must begin.

32
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,981
Master Yoda.

33
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:56,570
The Force made physical, a Jedi is.

34
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,781
Comes great responsibility with that. Yes?

35
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,661
Protect others, how does a Jedi? Hmm?

36
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,374
Build your own lightsaber, you shall.

37
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,212
But first, harvest your crystal,
each one of you must.

38
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,338
- See, I told you!
- No, I told you.

39
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,547
Yoda! Wow.

40
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,715
No, I told you.

41
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,178
The heart of the lightsaber, the crystal is.

42
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,139
Focuses the Force from the Jedi, it does.

43
00:04:55,671 --> 00:05:01,176
If Jedi you are to become,
enter the Crystal Cave, you must.

44
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,804
Trust yourself,

45
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,347
trust each other,

46
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,141
and succeed, you will.

47
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:13,647
Once you have found your crystal,
do not remain inside.

48
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,861
As daylight ends, the door will freeze
over again, and you will be trapped.

49
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,363
For how long?

50
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:26,118
For one rotation. There will be nothing
anyone can do for you.

51
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,537
How will we know which crystal to pick?

52
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,624
Only you can know which one is yours.
Now hurry.

53
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:53,812
How do they expect us to find our crystals
when the whole place is made up of ice?

54
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:58,442
I don't see the big deal though.
I could easily last a night in here.

55
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,360
From my calculations,

56
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:04,031
taking into account
the planetary movements in this system,

57
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,493
um, the sun only rises
on Ilum every 19 days.

58
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,121
That's a very long night.

59
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,291
Well, I don't know about you lot,
but enough with the chatter.

60
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,169
I'm going to be the first
to get my crystal and get out of here.

61
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:21,131
Petro, wait.
Maybe we should stay together.

62
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,842
No, thank you. You're on your own.

63
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,554
Come on, we need to keep moving.

64
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,394
You're right. He is selfish.

65
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,701
Uh, which way now?

66
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,078
We don't have much time,

67
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,455
and we have no idea
where the crystals are.

68
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,374
We need to break into groups.

69
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,959
What? No!

70
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,629
Are we Jedi or cowards?

71
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,465
On the count of three,
close your eyes and point to a door,

72
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,510
and that's the direction each of us will go.

73
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,514
One, two, three.

74
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,983
Uh, sorry, Byph.
Looks like you're on your own.

75
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,780
Byph, your instincts
told you to go that way.

76
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,491
You have to follow your instincts.

77
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,456
You shouldn't be afraid of monsters, Byph!
You're a Jedi.

78
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,109
That must be a crystal.

79
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,635
I don't think this is the right way.

80
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,179
We better go back.

81
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,724
Wait. Up there, look!

82
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,685
Something's flashing.

83
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,941
- I can't see anything.
- Why can't you see it?

84
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,360
Maybe because it's your crystal.

85
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,196
They said only we would know.

86
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,781
You'll have to climb.

87
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:51,949
But up there?

88
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,160
It's just so high.

89
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,621
I can't do that.

90
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,540
I believe in you.

91
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,335
What if I get up there, and there's nothing?

92
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,797
Well, that's a risk you'll have to take.

93
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,298
Hey, you're lucky.

94
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,885
I haven't even seen
anything resembling my crystal yet.

95
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:13,262
Good luck.

96
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,190
A whistling? I can't hear anything.

97
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,412
You think it's your crystal?

98
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,587
Gungi, no. You'll never make it.

99
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,089
You'll freeze to death if you fall in.

100
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,175
You need to be patient.

101
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,469
See how the sun is setting
and moving away from the lake?

102
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,848
Just like the door we came through,
it's freezing over again.

103
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,600
Once the water freezes over,

104
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,143
you will have very little time

105
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,770
to get your crystal and get out.

106
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,027
Now, excuse me. I have a crystal to find,
and I'm running out of time.

107
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,778
Good luck, Gungi.

108
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,322
This whole thing is ridiculous.
I don't even think there are any crystals.

109
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,782
You hear me?

110
00:10:56,865 --> 00:11:00,494
You just have us walking in circles
until we freeze to death.

111
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:03,163
I'm never going to find a crystal. Never!

112
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,709
Ah!

113
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,469
Now what?

114
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,726
Looks like I'm the first back
with my crystal. Hmm.

115
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,936
That wasn't so hard.

116
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:27,646
And the others?

117
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:31,775
Who knows? I didn't want to gloat
since I found mine so quickly.

118
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,238
Show us.

119
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,248
A crystal, you have found.

120
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,000
Water, you have brought.

121
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:52,379
But that's impossible.
It was my crystal, I was sure of it.

122
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,839
Hmm.

123
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:58,010
So certain, were you.
Go back, and closer you must look.

124
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,805
But the door is already half-closed.

125
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,141
Then you better hurry.

126
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,329
Oh!

127
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,461
You can do this, Katooni. You can do it.

128
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,508
That's impossible.

129
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:41,845
It's saying there's crystals everywhere,
but I can't see anything!

130
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,972
Where? Which way?

131
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:45,474
Ugh!

132
00:12:45,516 --> 00:12:47,184
You're useless.

133
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,478
Stupid, useless, dumb thing,

134
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,647
can't even find a simple small crystal!

135
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,148
Ugh!

136
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,679
There's so many.

137
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,682
How am I supposed to know
which one is mine?

138
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,184
It's hopeless.

139
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,520
Hopeless.

140
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,946
Well, that's going to take too long.

141
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,698
I'm not afraid.

142
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,867
I can do this.

143
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,994
I'm a Jedi.

144
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:14,873
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force will guide me.

145
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm running out of time. Where is it?

146
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,532
Come on, Zatt.

147
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:53,328
You're going to have to trust yourself
instead of relying on technology.

148
00:15:53,412 --> 00:15:55,038
You can do it.

149
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,421
I can feel it.

150
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,256
It's close.

151
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,843
I can sense it.

152
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,184
That must be it.

153
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,823
Oh, great!

154
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,074
Ah!

155
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:08,338
Oh, no. It's a dead end.

156
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:12,342
Is anyone there?

157
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,594
Can you hear me?

158
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:18,265
Great! I have my crystal,
but I'll never get out of this place!

159
00:18:25,022 --> 00:18:28,400
Well done, Gungi, but two still remain.

160
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,620
I'm running in circles!

161
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,372
Petro! Petro!

162
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,419
- Katooni?
- Petro, I'm trapped.

163
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,046
Can you help me get out?

164
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,214
I...

165
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,550
I can't. I still haven't found my crystal.

166
00:18:53,592 --> 00:18:55,719
Petro, you can't leave me!

167
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,598
- I have to go.
- Petro, no!

168
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,228
Petro! Petro!

169
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,902
- Will they make it, Master?
- We should help them.

170
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,240
Left the cave, you have.
Help them, you will not.

171
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,161
Come on!

172
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:42,891
- Katooni. Katooni!
- Petro?

173
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:45,060
- Petro!
- There's no time.

174
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,938
Put your hand on the ice.
Together, we can break it.

175
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,750
I knew you'd come back.
Come on. The doors are closing.

176
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,295
Petro?

177
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:15,132
Go ahead. I think I see something.

178
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,758
But it's too late.

179
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,635
Trust me. Go!

180
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:40,365
I have my crystal, but Petro is still inside.

181
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,826
Give up on your friend, do not.

182
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,676
Petro! You made it!

183
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,512
How did he break the ice?

184
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:04,181
Only water made solid was the door.

185
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:07,351
Easy to break, if you have the will.

186
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,188
You said we would be trapped.

187
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,776
Not by the cave, you were,
but by your mind.

188
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:17,152
Lessons you have learned.

189
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:19,780
Find courage, you did.

190
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,199
Hope,

191
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,785
patience,

192
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,288
trust,

193
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:29,832
confidence,

194
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,627
and selflessness. Yes?

195
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:42,302
Take your crystals back to the Temple
and keep them safe, young Jedi.

196
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,473
- So exciting!
- Yes!

197
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:47,975
All right!

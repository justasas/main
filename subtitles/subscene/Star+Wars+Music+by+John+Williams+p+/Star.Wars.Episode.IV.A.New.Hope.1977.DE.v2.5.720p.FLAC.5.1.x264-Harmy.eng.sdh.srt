He didn’t hold with your father’s ideals.

...and not gotten involved.

– Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

...the same as your father.

318
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:42,555

– He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

319

...and a cunning warrior.

I understand you’ve become
quite a good pilot yourself.

Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

– Your father’s lightsaber.

This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

331

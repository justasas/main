1
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:19,545
<i>Stranded!</i>

2
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:21,546
<i>On a secret mission for the Republic,</i>

3
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:24,415
<i>Colonel Gascon
and his intrepid droid squad</i>

4
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:26,551
<i>successfully steal an encryption module</i>

5
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:28,319
<i>from a Separatist ship.</i>

6
00:00:28,354 --> 00:00:30,688
<i>During their escape, our heroes crash</i>

7
00:00:30,723 --> 00:00:32,757
<i>on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar</i>

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,393
<i>and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland</i>

9
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:37,428
<i>called The Void.</i>

10
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:39,798
<i>Now, after surviving against all odds,</i>

11
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,100
<i>our heroes must find a way home</i>

12
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:43,835
<i>and deliver the encryption module</i>

13
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,638
<i>to crack the Separatist code
and stop an enemy attack.</i>

14
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,976
I have never been to Tatooine,

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,244
but if this place
reminds you of it, R2,

16
00:00:54,279 --> 00:00:56,480
remind me never to go there.

17
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:03,452
Don't be absurd, QT.

18
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,487
These people aren't dangerous.

19
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,265
Most of these people are probably hiding

20
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,966
from someone or something.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,035
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,770
Nobody's here by choice,

23
00:01:25,804 --> 00:01:27,638
which goes double for me.

24
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,039
I hope you have a plan

25
00:01:29,074 --> 00:01:31,541
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

26
00:01:31,576 --> 00:01:33,976
Of course I do, Corporal.

27
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,645
All we need is a communications uplink

28
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,679
and some fuel.

29
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:41,449
Thank you for the reminder, C4,

30
00:01:41,484 --> 00:01:44,851
but I'm well aware our shuttle's
lost in The Void.

31
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,388
I'm talking about fuel for me.

32
00:01:47,422 --> 00:01:50,457
You droids can putter along
on battery power

33
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,993
but I need food to survive.

34
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,795
My power cells are running low, too,

35
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,098
and an oil bath would be nice.

36
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:01,601
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

37
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:03,970
Forget it, BZ.

38
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,938
We're not on vacation here.

39
00:02:05,973 --> 00:02:08,942
R2, is the encryption module safe?

40
00:02:10,712 --> 00:02:13,247
Nothing short of death or dismemberment

41
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:15,449
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

42
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,618
from delivering
that module to Coruscant.

43
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:24,691
Well, I'll be.

44
00:02:24,726 --> 00:02:27,194
A diner.
A place of eating.

45
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:29,295
I'm saved.

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,065
R2, you and the other 'mechs
scout the perimeter.

47
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,101
Find out if there
are any unfriendlies around.

48
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:40,439
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

49
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,554
Good day.

50
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:04,762
I am Colonel Gascon of
the Grand Army of the Republic.

51
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:07,732
And I am here
on very important business.

52
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:16,840
I don't have much time,
so if you'll be so kind

53
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:20,945
as to fix me your daily special
and let my droid recharge.

54
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,547
No droids.

55
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:26,983
Fine.

56
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:29,386
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,423
We don't serve your type either.

58
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:35,492
What type are you referring to?

59
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:38,462
Conduit worms.

60
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,136
I beg your pardon.
I am a Zilkan.

61
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:47,972
You'll be begging for your life

62
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:49,773
if you don't beat it.

63
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:54,279
Beat it.

64
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:55,313
Uh-oh.

65
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,314
Ah!

66
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:59,216
Oh, ah!

67
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,618
This is an outrage.

68
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:04,054
That monstrosity will rue the day

69
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:06,056
he denied me a meal.

70
00:04:06,124 --> 00:04:08,125
I would not push it, Colonel.

71
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,060
That monstrosity
might make a meal out of you.

72
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:12,428
I don't care.

73
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,030
I'm famished.

74
00:04:19,737 --> 00:04:22,404
I think I can help.

75
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:37,619
Your meal awaits you, sir.

76
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:40,556
You short-circuiting
hydrospanner,

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,890
that's no meal.

78
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,891
That is garbage.

79
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,226
What is the difference?

80
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,727
It is edible, is it not?

81
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,856
Agh!

82
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,259
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:19,360
I didn't see you there.

84
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:21,062
Look, I could get you some food,

85
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:24,199
but normally people
come in the front door.

86
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:27,336
But there's no problem.

87
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,638
You do know that
you're eating garbage, right?

88
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:34,610
You're a clone.

89
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:35,945
Excuse me?

90
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,981
Uh, I...

91
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:39,015
I wouldn't know about that.

92
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,716
My... my name's Gregor.

93
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,252
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

94
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:51,559
You are a clone.

95
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:54,227
Are you working undercover?

96
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:57,197
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,732
Listen to me, soldier,
whatever your assignment is,

98
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:01,766
it can't be more important than mine.

99
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,535
It is his first real mission.

100
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:05,203
He is just a map reader.

101
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:07,739
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

102
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:11,375
You are a clone and a soldier
in the Republic Army,

103
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,010
and I order you to take me to your ship.

104
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:16,713
We need to get back to Coruscant
immediately.

105
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:19,683
Uh, look, friend,
I was just trying to help.

106
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:21,718
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

107
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:23,052
I do not think that soldier

108
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:26,655
believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel.

109
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,990
Gregor!

110
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,259
Get back to work.

111
00:06:30,293 --> 00:06:32,561
Uh, excuse me.
I got to go.

112
00:06:32,595 --> 00:06:34,830
I don't wanna lose my job.

113
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:40,101
But I'm still hungry.

114
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:55,115
Well, what's the scouting report?

115
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,319
Separatist droids?

116
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,956
Hmm, well, that complicates matters.

117
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,127
So, uh, boss,

118
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:11,863
you know, I was just wondering...

119
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:14,965
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,100
Oh, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:18,135
I don't want a raise, sir.

122
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:22,005
I-I just wanted to know,
what's a clone?

123
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,775
Someone told me I was a clone today.

124
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:25,876
They insisted.

125
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,077
Heh.
A clone?

126
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:31,514
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

127
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:33,683
They are brave soldiers.

128
00:07:33,717 --> 00:07:37,052
Does that sound like you?

129
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:39,554
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

130
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,257
Forget about clones
or anything like that.

131
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:45,459
You have good life here,

132
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:47,361
a simple life.

133
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,929
More than you had when Borkus found you.

134
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:51,231
I know, sir.

135
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:52,632
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

136
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:53,666
Believe me.

137
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,901
But I thought maybe you could...

138
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,303
could you tell me, how did I get here?

139
00:07:58,337 --> 00:07:59,471
Where did you find me?

140
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:00,872
Enough questions.

141
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,140
Go home. Sleep.

142
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:05,509
Come back tomorrow.
Do your job.

143
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,812
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again,

144
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:10,247
understand?

145
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:22,662
I cannot help noticing

146
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:25,480
that we are already on our third plan.

147
00:08:25,962 --> 00:08:30,898
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

148
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,966
something droids are not known for.

149
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:36,503
R2 is right.

150
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:38,971
Droids are not known for being flexible,

151
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:41,973
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

152
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:44,042
Well, answer me this, Corporal,

153
00:08:44,076 --> 00:08:46,878
if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

154
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:49,280
were better prepared
to lead this mission,

155
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,982
then why did they put me in charge?

156
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:54,918
'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside BZ.

157
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:00,625
No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

158
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,894
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

159
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:06,631
then there must be a landing zone nearby

160
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:10,468
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

161
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:14,838
That, Corporal, is why <i>I</i> am in charge.

162
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:21,078
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

163
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:23,080
just like we did on the dreadnought,

164
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,482
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

165
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,319
The mechs have a point, Colonel.

166
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:31,954
After what we did on the dreadnought,

167
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,090
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

168
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,925
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

169
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,594
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

170
00:09:40,628 --> 00:09:42,329
But there's no way in Malachor

171
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:45,198
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

172
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:47,799
on an assault of that landing zone.

173
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,401
What is the plan now, Colonel?

174
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:53,471
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

175
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:57,509
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

176
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:51,724
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

177
00:10:51,758 --> 00:10:53,158
Agh! What?

178
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:01,131
I...

179
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,699
I don't understand.

180
00:11:02,733 --> 00:11:04,967
That's me?

181
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,068
No, that's Captain Rex.

182
00:11:07,103 --> 00:11:09,737
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

183
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:11,906
just like you, Gregor.

184
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,609
I can't believe it.

185
00:11:15,644 --> 00:11:17,243
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

186
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:21,815
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

187
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,751
Millions.
A whole army's worth.

188
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,486
Uh-huh.

189
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:29,822
And they all look exactly like me?

190
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,325
No, those clones are warriors,

191
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,361
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

192
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,630
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

193
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,066
in our war against the Separatists.

194
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,434
They're not dishwashers

195
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,837
living in
some vermin-infested hovel.

196
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,775
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

197
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:54,811
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

198
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,712
so he pays the difference for me.

199
00:11:56,747 --> 00:11:58,414
Don't you get it, Gregor?

200
00:11:58,449 --> 00:11:59,916
You're his slave.

201
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,117
We need to figure out
who you really are,

202
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:03,719
how you got here.

203
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:06,822
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

204
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:12,929
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

205
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,130
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

206
00:12:15,164 --> 00:12:19,401
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

207
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:20,668
Hmm.

208
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:24,205
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

209
00:12:24,239 --> 00:12:26,873
Your military records
will be in the database.

210
00:12:26,908 --> 00:12:28,308
Scan him, R2.

211
00:12:35,517 --> 00:12:37,485
Impressive.

212
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:43,191
Gregor, your designation
is CC-5576-39.

213
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:47,728
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

214
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:50,031
A clone commando.

215
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:53,701
Your file says you were reported

216
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:56,237
missing in action during

217
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:58,072
the Battle of Sarrish.

218
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,875
Sarrish?

219
00:13:01,943 --> 00:13:03,877
Sarrish.

220
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:05,979
Wait.

221
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:08,214
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

222
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:12,117
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

223
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:14,486
Sarrish.

224
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:16,155
Yes.

225
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:18,157
Yes, I remember now.

226
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:20,625
So many soldiers were dying.

227
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:24,029
Do... do you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

228
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:27,132
No.

229
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:31,437
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

230
00:13:31,471 --> 00:13:33,938
Bodies everywhere.

231
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:35,840
I knew I had to get help.

232
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:39,044
But that's where the memory stops.

233
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,379
Well, soldier,

234
00:13:40,414 --> 00:13:43,681
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

235
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:44,816
but you can help us.

236
00:13:45,852 --> 00:13:47,786
Our mission depends on it.

237
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:58,229
Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

238
00:13:58,263 --> 00:13:59,964
but it has been six.

239
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,267
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

240
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,769
Then I'll go back in there

241
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,471
and personally
knock some sense into him.

242
00:14:06,505 --> 00:14:07,505
That won't be necessary.

243
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:08,673
Whoa!

244
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,043
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

245
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,145
might bring back some more memories,

246
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,347
until we recover my equipment anyway.

247
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:18,549
I overheard you guys talking.

248
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,817
I think I know where my armor is.

249
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,252
Let's go check out the diner.

250
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:34,297
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

251
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,265
We do not have all night.

252
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:41,169
Looking for this?

253
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:49,976
My uniform.
My equipment.

254
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:53,045
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

255
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Why?

256
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:57,216
I don't care who you were.

257
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,118
You are dishwasher now.

258
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:03,223
And you owe me for saving you
from your crash.

259
00:15:03,257 --> 00:15:05,826
Your life is mine, Gregor.

260
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,594
You didn't save me.

261
00:15:07,628 --> 00:15:09,629
You turned me into a slave.

262
00:15:09,664 --> 00:15:12,132
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

263
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,086
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

264
00:15:14,101 --> 00:15:15,668
I want my life back.

265
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:18,037
You want your freedom, Gregor?

266
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,306
Take your gun from me.

267
00:15:20,374 --> 00:15:22,675
Show me you are a soldier.

268
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,176
You see?

269
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,478
You are no soldier.

270
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:29,580
You are a dishwasher.

271
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:40,991
Why, you no-good droids.

272
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,227
Let go of me.

273
00:15:44,262 --> 00:15:45,496
Agh! Oh.

274
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:47,963
Agh!

275
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:49,965
Take your things, Gregor.

276
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,367
We're getting out of here.

277
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:55,771
Don't leave, Gregor.

278
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:58,073
It's a big galaxy out there,

279
00:15:58,108 --> 00:15:59,574
bigger than you know.

280
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:02,577
Stay here, where your life is simple.

281
00:16:02,612 --> 00:16:05,180
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

282
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,848
Not for this clone.

283
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:07,882
Ha!

284
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,417
You will never get off Abafar,

285
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:13,821
you and your little Republic friends,

286
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:17,191
not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

287
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:19,360
What are you talking about?

288
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:23,664
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

289
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,666
They are mining our rhydonium

290
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,936
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

291
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,172
You will see.

292
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,574
You will all be stuck here

293
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:39,345
begging Borkus for a job in his diner.

294
00:17:00,633 --> 00:17:03,402
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

295
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,470
Gregor.

296
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,242
Wait.
There.

297
00:17:12,277 --> 00:17:14,478
There's a cruiser up there.

298
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,113
And that shuttle, I think...

299
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:19,948
Yes, it's being loaded up
with rhydonium canisters.

300
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,352
Huh.

301
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:24,487
I guess Mr. Borkus

302
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:27,122
was actually telling
the truth... for once.

303
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:29,422
What exactly is rhydonium?

304
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:30,856
It's a fuel.

305
00:17:30,891 --> 00:17:33,125
Mostly been mined out on Abafar.

306
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:34,826
It's volatile and dangerous.

307
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,828
Yes, we do have a new mission:

308
00:17:39,863 --> 00:17:43,565
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

309
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,333
I'll cover you
and clear the way, Colonel.

310
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:46,867
You all head straight to the shuttle.

311
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,669
I'll take care of those clankers.

312
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:51,370
Hmm, sounds like a good plan.

313
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,106
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

314
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,877
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

315
00:18:00,911 --> 00:18:02,844
Let's roll.

316
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,951
Hey!

317
00:18:13,219 --> 00:18:16,855
You need authorization
to enter this area.

318
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:17,889
Agh!

319
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,059
Get them!

320
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,195
Agh!

321
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,741
Good job, Gregor.

322
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,980
Look, he's up there!

323
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:58,787
Just keep moving.

324
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,055
It is all under control.

325
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:10,697
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

326
00:19:14,468 --> 00:19:16,937
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

327
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:19,072
Blast them!

328
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:21,473
They are on to us.

329
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,443
Colonel, can you hear me?

330
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,612
Save yourselves!

331
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,447
Okay.
Whoa!

332
00:19:29,481 --> 00:19:30,481
Agh!

333
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:33,049
Whoa-oh-oh.

334
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,559
Did everybody make it?

335
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:48,095
No, BZ and the colonel
are still out there.

336
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:50,430
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

337
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:55,802
Agh!

338
00:19:58,538 --> 00:19:59,805
Colonel, you all right?

339
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,374
I'll never make it back alive.

340
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,810
Yes, you will, sir.

341
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,344
This is what I was born to do.

342
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:07,112
Now, go before it's too late.

343
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,799
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

344
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:35,970
R2's right.

345
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,172
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

346
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,874
Don't worry about me.

347
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,809
You made me remember who I am.

348
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,644
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

349
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,812
Now go!

350
00:20:49,717 --> 00:20:51,217
Where is Gregor?

351
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,218
Where is Gregor?

352
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,088
He's doing what a soldier does:

353
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:59,725
sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

354
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:26,217
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

355
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,088
We'll take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

356
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,159
and we will watch for your return.

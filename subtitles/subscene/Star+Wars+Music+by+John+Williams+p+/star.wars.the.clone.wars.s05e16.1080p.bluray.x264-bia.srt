1
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:23,106
Neutral star systems in peril!

2
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,569
Darth Maul and Savage Opress
command the planet Mandalore

3
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,696
through the puppet Prime Minister, Almec,

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,241
while they expand
their criminal enterprise.

5
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,118
With the Death Watch removed
from power

6
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,746
and the Jedi unaware
of the villainous plot,

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,374
nothing stands in the way
of Darth Maul's vision

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,793
for a vast criminal empire.

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,087
We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned,

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,925
as her few remaining loyal subjects
make a desperate attempt to rescue her.

11
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:52,761
What do you want, you traitor?

12
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,391
I would never betray you, Auntie Satine.
I'm here to rescue you.

13
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,934
Korkie!

14
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,729
Freeze! Hold it there!

15
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,901
Death Watch!

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,406
Oh!

17
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,408
It's been a long time.

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,785
It's okay, Auntie. She's on our side now.

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,496
Why are you helping now?

20
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:23,458
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

21
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,503
There was a time
when we weren't enemies.

22
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,006
Perhaps that time has come again.

23
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,092
Come on, let's go.

24
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,642
It's all clear. Come on.

25
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:48,817
We need to contact the Jedi Council.
Korkie, give me your comlink.

26
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:51,028
It won't be any good
unless we get outside the city.

27
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,363
All other frequencies are jammed.

28
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,200
You are all taking a terrible risk
by helping me.

29
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:58,827
Nothing we haven't done before.
Right, Auntie?

30
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,954
Let's get going.

31
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,572
Take them out!

32
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,040
Get the Duchess clear!

33
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,495
The transmission is still blocked.

34
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,172
You're clear!

35
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,800
This is a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi.

36
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,595
I've lost Mandalore.
My people have been massacred...

37
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,601
Obi-Wan, I need your help.

38
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,612
You summoned me, Masters?

39
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,036
This is a message for Obi-Wan Kenobi.

40
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,122
I've lost Mandalore.
My people have been massacred,

41
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,666
and Almec is now the Prime Minister.

42
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,293
I can't explain everything now,

43
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,046
but Almec has the support
of the crime families.

44
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,133
Obi-Wan, I need your help.

45
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,972
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi?

46
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,643
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years,

47
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,480
and according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

48
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,149
they are no longer in league
with the Separatists.

49
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,984
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

50
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:39,821
it was most likely an independent act
caused by the Death Watch alone.

51
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,658
Without involvement from the Separatists,

52
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,827
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

53
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,663
I'm afraid we cannot help.

54
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,833
We cannot just hand Mandalore over
to these crime families

55
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,292
and let Satine become a martyr.

56
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,003
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

57
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,673
makes this situation difficult.

58
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,843
Understand your feelings I do, Obi-Wan.

59
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,386
But to take action,

60
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,848
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

61
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,183
You know what the Senate will decide.

62
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,894
They will not send aid to a neutral system.

63
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:15,190
At this time, nothing more can we do.

64
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,030
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

65
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,575
including the renegade
Death Watch soldiers,

66
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,326
but we will find them.

67
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:30,205
The Duchess appears to have contacted
the Jedi, just as anticipated.

68
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,667
Good. You have done well.

69
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,043
What of the people?

70
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:38,213
You are the legitimate Prime Minister.

71
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,593
Mandalore is a sovereign planet,
and you will maintain its neutrality.

72
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,386
And what of the Jedi?

73
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,724
Because of Mandalore's neutrality,

74
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,393
the Jedi have no jurisdiction here.

75
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:56,106
If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend,

76
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,401
he will have to come alone.

77
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,930
Oh!

78
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,723
Ah!

79
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:33,018
Anakin, that's the last time
I borrow a ship from you.

80
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,698
You better get your ship looked at.

81
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,617
Oh, it's my friend's ship.

82
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,538
He told me it was perfectly fine.

83
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:56,291
- I'm terribly sorry about that.
- Do you have a landing permit?

84
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,796
Um, I think I left it in the ship.
Uh, come with me and I'll get it.

85
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,348
Here to do more of your master's bidding?

86
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,976
I do my own bidding.

87
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,686
Obi-Wan!

88
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,525
Are you alone?

89
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,863
Yes. The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate
will be of no help to us here.

90
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:15,287
I trust you have an escape plan, then?

91
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,039
As always, my dear.

92
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,509
There's no record
of a prisoner transfer here.

93
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:30,677
The orders came from upstairs.

94
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,225
What's the authorization code?

95
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,018
Oh, um...

96
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,110
Hey, you! Stop!

97
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,406
It's the Duchess. She's getting away.

98
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,573
We have to contact my sister for help.
She'll send reinforcements.

99
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,032
Who's your sister?

100
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,006
Brace yourself!

101
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,472
Let's get out of here!

102
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,602
Obi-Wan!

103
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,381
No. It can't be.

104
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,600
We meet again, Kenobi.

105
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,853
Welcome to my world.

106
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,399
Take them back to the palace.

107
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:07,668
Your noble flaw is a weakness
shared by you and your Duchess.

108
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:14,216
You should have chosen
the dark side, Master Jedi.

109
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,595
Your emotions betray you.

110
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,226
Your fear, and yes, your anger.

111
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:27,980
Let your anger deepen your hatred!

112
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,065
Don't listen to him, Obi.

113
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,400
Quiet.

114
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:35,070
You can kill me,
but you will never destroy me.

115
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:38,240
It takes strength to resist the dark side.

116
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:40,242
Only the weak embrace it.

117
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,411
It is more powerful than you know.

118
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:45,789
And those who oppose it
are more powerful than you'll ever be.

119
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,586
I know where you're from.
I've been to your village.

120
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,131
I know the decision to join the dark side
wasn't yours.

121
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,925
- The Nightsisters made it for you.
- Silence!

122
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,468
You think you know me?

123
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:03,682
It was I who languished for years
thinking of nothing but you,

124
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,518
nothing but this moment.

125
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:13,025
And now the perfect tool for my vengeance
is in front of us.

126
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,485
I never planned on killing you,

127
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:20,616
but I will make you share my pain, Kenobi.

128
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,338
Satine...

129
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,809
Remember, my dear Obi-Wan,

130
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,441
I've loved you always.

131
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,028
I always will.

132
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,668
Do we kill him now, brother?

133
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,879
No. Imprison him below.

134
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,007
Let him drown in his misery.

135
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,177
Take him to his cell to rot.

136
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:45,367
You summoned me, Chancellor?

137
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,703
Prepare my ship.

138
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,228
It's the rebels!

139
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,587
Sorry, I don't believe we've met. You are?

140
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:42,424
Bo-Katan. I'm here to rescue you.
That's all you need to know.

141
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,092
Sounds good to me.

142
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:46,720
You ever use one of these before?

143
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,806
No, but in this case I'm a fast learner.

144
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,683
Let's go.

145
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,354
Halt!

146
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,252
Maul must really want you dead.

147
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,046
You have no idea.

148
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,138
Hmm... I sense a presence.

149
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:56,266
A presence I haven't felt since...

150
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:57,726
Master!

151
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:13,450
Master.

152
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,119
I am most impressed

153
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:19,748
to see you have survived your injuries.

154
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,751
I used your training, Master,

155
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:28,173
and I have built all this
in hopes of returning to your side.

156
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,925
Hmm.

157
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,593
How unfortunate

158
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:35,931
that you are attempting to deceive me.

159
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:37,599
Master?

160
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:42,437
You have become a rival!

161
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,126
Go back to your Republic
and tell them what has happened.

162
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:49,421
That would likely lead
to a Republic invasion of Mandalore.

163
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:53,300
Yes, and Maul will die.
But Mandalore will survive.

164
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,344
We always survive.

165
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:57,137
Now go!

166
00:18:58,597 --> 00:19:00,807
You're Satine's sister, aren't you?

167
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
I'm so sorry.

168
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:11,170
Brother!

169
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,812
Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice.

170
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:34,943
I'm not like you. I never was.

171
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:42,159
Remember the first and only reality
of the Sith.

172
00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,578
There can only be two.

173
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,874
And you are no longer my apprentice.

174
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,420
You have been replaced.

175
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,337
Have mercy.

176
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,464
Please!

177
00:21:37,923 --> 00:21:39,049
Please!

178
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,801
There is no mercy.

179
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,682
Do not worry,

180
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,518
I'm not going to kill you.

181
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:54,064
I have other uses for you.

1
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:19,454
<i>Invasion!</i>

2
00:00:19,488 --> 00:00:22,725
<i>The planet Cato Neimoidia
is under Separatist attack.</i>

3
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,997
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ashoka Tano,</i>

4
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:28,734
<i>rush to the rescue as they lead
a squadron of starfighters</i>

5
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,072
<i>to the planet below.</i>

6
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,423
Ahsoka, punch a hole
for the gunships to get through.

7
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:43,326
I know the drill, Master.

8
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:08,733
Look out, incoming missiles.

9
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,706
No problem.

10
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:17,681
Uh...
slight problem.

11
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:21,920
Ahsoka, I've got buzz droids.

12
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:23,055
How bad did you get hit?

13
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,423
I'm all clear.

14
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,626
What?

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,462
You always have it easy, Snips.

16
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,910
Good job, R2.

17
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,913
Someday these droids will learn
they keep messing

18
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:40,382
with the wrong Jedi.

19
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,085
Looks like you're clear.

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,723
Just keep watching
and learning, Padawan.

21
00:01:47,493 --> 00:01:48,693
Uh-oh.

22
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:49,862
You're trailing smoke.

23
00:01:49,896 --> 00:01:50,896
What's wrong?

24
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:52,633
Oh, nothing serious.

25
00:01:52,667 --> 00:01:54,536
Just a small malfunction.

26
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,806
Ugh!

27
00:01:58,644 --> 00:02:00,012
Master?

28
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:01,381
Master, come in.

29
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:03,284
R2, what's going on over there?

30
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:06,791
Unconscious?

31
00:02:06,825 --> 00:02:07,993
Fly back to the cruiser.

32
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,763
What do you mean there's something wrong

33
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,832
with the engines?

34
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,903
Tip your wing.
I'll see how bad it is.

35
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,812
Oh, that's not good.

36
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:23,817
Let's just say now would be
a good time to land.

37
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:29,060
R2, can you land the ship
on that cliff ledge?

38
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:33,700
I don't care if the landing zone
is too short.

39
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,470
Get that ship on the ground.

40
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:39,875
R7, take over the ship.

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,845
I'm going after Anakin.

42
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,948
Somebody has to save his skin.

43
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,875
R2!

44
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:34,693
Ugh, very funny, R2.

45
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:37,163
Are you okay, Master?

46
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:39,768
Yeah, what'd I miss?

47
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,572
Oh, not much.

48
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,207
Wait a minute.
Wasn't I flying?

49
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:45,242
Where's my fighter?

50
00:03:45,244 --> 00:03:46,612
How did I get here?

51
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:47,746
Fighter crashed.

52
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:48,781
I saved the day.

53
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:49,988
You're welcome.

54
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:55,093
Huh, all right.

55
00:03:57,764 --> 00:04:00,534
Captain Rex,
Ahsoka and I need a little help.

56
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:01,903
Right away, sir.

57
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,654
Master Yoda.

58
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:15,993
<i>Return to the Jedi Temple
quickly, you should,</i>

59
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,228
<i>you and your Padawan.</i>

60
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,933
We're kind of busy, Master Yoda.

61
00:04:19,967 --> 00:04:23,639
<i>The reason we need you,
important it is, Skywalker.</i>

62
00:04:23,673 --> 00:04:26,310
<i>Bombed the Temple hangar, someone has.</i>

63
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:29,181
<i>Your assistance to find
the terrorist, we need.</i>

64
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:32,186
Who could successfully bomb
the Jedi Temple?

65
00:04:32,221 --> 00:04:35,225
We'll be right there, Master.

66
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:48,245
How could the Separatists
infiltrate the Temple?

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,716
Worse than that it is.

68
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,219
What could be worse, Master Yoda?

69
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,329
Everything is on the table.

70
00:04:59,363 --> 00:05:00,932
We have to look at the possibility

71
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,337
that it could've been anyone
in the Temple, even a Jedi.

72
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:06,674
If a Jedi this is,

73
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,812
gone to the dark side they have.

74
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:12,617
I...
I can't believe a Jedi

75
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:15,154
would attack a place this sacred.

76
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,159
We'd like for you two to lead
the investigation.

77
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,932
We can't trust anyone
who was here, even a Jedi.

78
00:05:21,966 --> 00:05:24,087
You and Ahsoka will provide
an impartial point of view

79
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:25,271
free of assumptions.

80
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:27,074
We'll do everything we can.

81
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:30,112
Careful you must be, Skywalker.

82
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,983
If willing to destroy the Temple
the attacker is,

83
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:36,355
to great lengths they will go
to keep from being caught.

84
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:38,726
Then I guess we'll have to go
to even greater lengths

85
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,763
to catch him.

86
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,149
I can still hear the screams.

87
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,059
Do you believe what they said, Master,

88
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,097
that a Jedi could do this?

89
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:57,201
Not every Jedi agrees
with this war, Ahsoka.

90
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,873
There are many
political idealists among us.

91
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,509
But a traitor?

92
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:04,947
I'm afraid one can eventually
become the other.

93
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:07,786
Remember Count Dooku and General Krell.

94
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,221
That's how they started, too.

95
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:11,358
Only analysis and investigation

96
00:06:11,392 --> 00:06:14,028
will prove what is true or not.

97
00:06:14,062 --> 00:06:15,364
Who are you?

98
00:06:15,398 --> 00:06:17,667
I am Russo-ISC,

99
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,837
Crime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi.

100
00:06:19,872 --> 00:06:23,843
I will be working with you
and your Padawan on this case.

101
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:27,415
I was assigned by Master Windu.

102
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:28,951
Okay, Russo,

103
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:30,821
you and Ahsoka should
begin the interviews.

104
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,727
I would rather interview
the witnesses alone.

105
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:37,732
Why?

106
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:39,768
Many of the wounded have heard rumors

107
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,904
a Jedi was behind this explosion.

108
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,013
There will be ill will toward you.

109
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:49,351
I think you're overexaggerating, Russo.

110
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:50,987
There were Jedi killed in that blast

111
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:53,256
along with maintenance crew and clones.

112
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,792
Take Ahsoka with you.

113
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,195
Let me know if you find anything.

114
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,764
I will, Master.

115
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:14,225
Did you notice anything unusual
about the hangar?

116
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:16,027
Not really.

117
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,431
Although, I left the
hangar five minutes before

118
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:19,767
the bomb exploded.

119
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:22,305
Did everything seem okay before that?

120
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,710
Everything seemed normal.

121
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,648
Is it true a Jedi might be
responsible for the attack?

122
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:33,055
We're not certain of anything
at this point.

123
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,430
This distrust is troubling.

124
00:07:38,464 --> 00:07:41,402
Some of these people have worked
in the Temple for years.

125
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:45,975
Fear makes even the most
trusting individual irrational.

126
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,016
I think I know who did it,
who blew up the hangar.

127
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,391
Who?

128
00:07:55,425 --> 00:07:58,696
I believe it was Jackar Bowmani.

129
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,600
Jackar Bowmani.

130
00:08:00,634 --> 00:08:01,868
Who is Jackar?

131
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:04,439
One of the maintenance crew
in the hangar.

132
00:08:04,473 --> 00:08:06,075
Why do you think it was him?

133
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,549
I passed him as I was going
on my shift change.

134
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,753
He...
he had been working all morning

135
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:14,923
in the section the blast came from.

136
00:08:14,957 --> 00:08:17,159
It was the last place I saw him.

137
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,829
Is this him?

138
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,567
Yes.

139
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:24,839
I need to know, have you
seen him since the explosion?

140
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,342
No.

141
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:29,915
Truthfully, I didn't see much
of anything after the explosion.

142
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,254
Thank you.

143
00:08:38,998 --> 00:08:42,636
Looks like we need to find
Jackar Bowmani, Russo.

144
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:52,286
Did you find anything?

145
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,226
No, but the rumor about it
being a Jedi is growing, Ahsoka.

146
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,962
I can feel the anger and confusion

147
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,131
throughout the Jedi Temple.

148
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:01,067
Russo and I have a lead.

149
00:09:01,102 --> 00:09:04,306
We are looking for one of the
Temple workers, Jackar Bowmani.

150
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,209
One of the witnesses saw him in the area

151
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:09,015
where the bomb exploded
right before it happened,

152
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,821
and we have not been able
to find him anywhere.

153
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:15,591
Come on.
Nobody just disappears.

154
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:18,363
Unless it was well planned out.

155
00:09:18,397 --> 00:09:21,034
Well, it had to be well
planned out to get past Jedi.

156
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:26,008
I'll talk to security.

157
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,744
No more clones.

158
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,247
Stop the violence.

159
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,783
End the war.

160
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:33,354
Stop the violence.

161
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,569
They're all family and friends?

162
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:45,906
Yes, looking for answers.

163
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,576
So am I, Cin.

164
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,480
This is the guy who might be
behind all of this.

165
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,717
If you see him, alert me immediately.

166
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,723
That is Jackar.

167
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:58,159
You know this man?

168
00:09:58,193 --> 00:09:59,794
He is my husband.

169
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:02,633
I've been trying to reach him
since I heard of an explosion.

170
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,667
Where is he?

171
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,537
I need you to come with me.

172
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,253
You have no idea where Jackar is?

173
00:10:15,287 --> 00:10:16,455
No.

174
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:19,693
You are a Jedi, and you cannot find him?

175
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:21,964
I understand your frustration.

176
00:10:21,998 --> 00:10:24,367
Don't.
Just find Jackar.

177
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:28,240
Letta, do you think Jackar
could do something like this,

178
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:29,576
blow up the Temple?

179
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,013
Do you have any idea
what someone has to go through

180
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,317
to work in the Jedi Temple, hm?

181
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:37,489
Jackar dedicated his life
to serving the Jedi.

182
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:38,925
It had been his dream.

183
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,162
Not just anyone can walk into
your precious Temple.

184
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:44,633
He passed all the entry tests
that were needed.

185
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,037
Okay, I had to ask.

186
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,775
Unfortunately, everyone's a suspect.

187
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,346
Jackar would never do anything
like this.

188
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,484
Please, find him.

189
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,602
Hmm...

190
00:11:27,636 --> 00:11:31,141
based on the trajectory of the debris,

191
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:35,080
it seems the blast came from there.

192
00:11:35,115 --> 00:11:38,052
Why is there no bomb residue?

193
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:40,924
So you think whoever did this
triggered a ship to explode?

194
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,359
We think so.

195
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:45,931
Russo's trying to use the
shrapnel to determine that now.

196
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,702
The witness says he saw Jackar
in the area.

197
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:53,043
Maybe Jackar planned to do this
and just kept quiet.

198
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,177
Or...

199
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:56,782
It actually was a Jedi.

200
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,093
I found something, an anomaly,

201
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:07,532
something that should not be here.

202
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:18,481
These pieces came from the blast origin.

203
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,386
They are covered with microscopic droids

204
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,422
of a highly volatile nature.

205
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,927
Nano-droids.

206
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:30,300
Yes, nano-droids.

207
00:12:30,334 --> 00:12:31,835
Great.

208
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,607
Now we're chasing nano-droids.

209
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:36,576
Russo, go through security footage.

210
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:39,413
Try to see if Jackar went
to other parts of the Temple.

211
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,851
Ahsoka, let's go find out
how Jackar got his hands

212
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:44,654
on these nano-droids.

213
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,701
Bowmani's file, Master Jedi.

214
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:56,205
He's a munitions expert.

215
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:59,010
Jackar was the foreman over
all of the gunships,

216
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:00,879
bombs, and weapons.

217
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,783
His specialty was nano-weaponry.

218
00:13:02,817 --> 00:13:06,055
We've got to find this guy.

219
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,635
Isn't that going a little
too fast for you

220
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:12,832
to make sense out of it?

221
00:13:12,866 --> 00:13:14,402
It is simple data.

222
00:13:14,436 --> 00:13:18,541
At this pace, I am able to view
hundreds of hours of footage.

223
00:13:18,575 --> 00:13:21,312
Have you found Jackar?

224
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:22,547
No.

225
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,485
I'll gather some Jedi
and search the Temple.

226
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,956
If he's still here, he might be
planning another attack.

227
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,191
Instead of Jedi,

228
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,963
I have droids
that can do the job much faster.

1
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,722
So you've found nothing so far?

2
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,391
We have a clue we're following.

3
00:13:50,426 --> 00:13:52,261
But we still don't have answers.

4
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,471
It is imperative
that the truth be found soon.

5
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,575
There are whispers
the Senate will have a meeting

6
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:02,545
to decide whether the military police

7
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:05,248
will need to become involved
in the investigation.

8
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:06,884
They can't do that.

9
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:10,656
Clones died in that explosion,

10
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,425
maintenance clones working
on the gunships

11
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,827
as well as civilians.

12
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:16,899
The Senate tends to take notice
of these things

13
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:19,838
no matter where they happen.

14
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:24,811
Master Skywalker, we have found Jackar.

15
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:27,315
Lock down all exits so he can't escape.

16
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:40,568
Where is he?

17
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:44,241
Well, part of him is here.

18
00:14:44,276 --> 00:14:47,145
I don't think now
is a good time to joke.

19
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:51,785
This is all that remains of Jackar.

20
00:14:51,819 --> 00:14:53,221
His hand?

21
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:56,292
The rest of him exploded.

22
00:14:56,327 --> 00:14:57,808
Because he was so close to the bomb?

23
00:14:57,829 --> 00:15:00,965
Because he <i>was</i> the bomb.

24
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,137
What's this?

25
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,806
The connection we were looking for

26
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:08,278
to the explosion in the hangar.

27
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:10,348
The nano-droids.

28
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,685
How did they get in his bloodstream?

29
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:15,890
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

30
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:18,495
We're going to have to search
Jackar's home for evidence.

31
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:48,232
This is not the nicest place.

32
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:51,904
I would've thought working
for the Jedi paid better.

33
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,323
Letta?
Are you here?

34
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:07,262
You search for the droids,
but be careful,

35
00:16:07,296 --> 00:16:10,668
and remember, he was a munitions expert.

36
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:13,673
I'd rather not set off
another explosion today.

37
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:15,877
I'll see if he left a note.

38
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,026
Letta?

39
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:33,634
Master.

40
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:36,739
The sensors are picking up
traces from the disposal.

41
00:17:38,242 --> 00:17:40,311
The nano-droids
were in the food.

42
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:42,614
Well, I guess the question now is,

43
00:17:42,649 --> 00:17:45,553
did he eat them willingly,
or did someone feed them to him?

44
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:48,323
Wh-what are you doing here?

45
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,795
We've learned Jackar
was involved in the bombing.

46
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,164
That can't be true.

47
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,569
See if she has any nano-droids
on her, Ahsoka.

48
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,179
Nanodroids?

49
00:18:02,213 --> 00:18:03,281
She's clean.

50
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,985
What do you mean,
"nano-droids"?

51
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,358
We believe someone set Jackar
up and made him the bomb.

52
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:15,299
I...
I don't understand.

53
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,036
Letta, I want to bring you in
for more questioning.

54
00:18:18,071 --> 00:18:23,077
Maybe you can help us make sense
out of all of this.

55
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:26,650
I'll answer any question I can.

56
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,114
Letta, stop.

57
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:48,851
Letta!

58
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:53,459
Letta.

59
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,968
Take the high road.

60
00:18:58,002 --> 00:19:02,809
Right, Master.

61
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,222
Letta, stop!

62
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:39,465
Let me go.

63
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,602
Running means you know more
than you're telling us.

64
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,037
Jackar is dead,

65
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:45,541
and now you're trying to blame
his murder on me.

66
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:48,614
Nobody ever said he was dead.

67
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:54,323
But running proves you had
something to do with the bomb.

68
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,594
You don't know what
you're talking about.

69
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,064
People blamed Jedi because of you.

70
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,603
People were killed because of you!

71
00:20:01,637 --> 00:20:03,639
You can't prove anything.

72
00:20:03,674 --> 00:20:06,945
Did you feed the nano-droids
to Jackar?

73
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:08,981
You will answer me.

74
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,350
Now!

75
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:16,025
I did feed the nano-droids
to Jackar.

76
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,164
You set up your own husband to die?

77
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,302
You're dealing with things
you don't understand.

78
00:20:23,738 --> 00:20:25,140
Oh, where you're going,

79
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:29,247
you'll have plenty of time
to explain everything.

80
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:33,179
We're holding Letta
in the cell below the temple

81
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:35,623
to await further questioning.

82
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:38,794
<i>I am pleased to report
there were no other nano-droids</i>

83
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:41,299
<i>found in the sweep of the Temple.</i>

84
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:45,938
<i>I am also pleased to report,
based on the security footage,</i>

85
00:20:45,973 --> 00:20:49,310
<i>Jackar Bowmani acted alone,</i>

86
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:53,216
<i>which means no Jedi was involved.</i>

87
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:54,351
Thanks, Russo.

88
00:20:54,385 --> 00:20:56,454
Good job.

89
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:59,859
Did this woman say what her
reasons were for attacking us?

90
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:02,330
Not yet, but we're working on that.

91
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:05,000
I think we can guess
her motives easily enough.

92
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,769
Public opinion is
swaying against the Jedi.

93
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:10,275
That is becoming clear.

94
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:14,115
This war is becoming less
and less popular

95
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,118
every day it persists.

96
00:21:19,591 --> 00:21:22,328
Master, I'm relieved
we solved this case, but...

97
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:24,230
What if it had been a Jedi?

98
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:25,266
Yes.

99
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,622
I don't know how I would have felt

100
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,537
if a Jedi was really behind this.

101
00:21:28,572 --> 00:21:33,012
There are going to be Jedi
who disappoint us, Ahsoka.

102
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:35,315
But as long as we know
there are good Jedi

103
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,989
who fight for what's right,
it makes it all worthwhile.

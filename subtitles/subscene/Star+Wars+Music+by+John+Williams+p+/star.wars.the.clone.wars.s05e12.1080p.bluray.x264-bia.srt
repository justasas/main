1
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,186
Stranded!

2
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,063
On a secret mission for the Republic,

3
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,066
Colonel Gascon
and his intrepid droid squad

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,736
successfully steal an encryption module
from a Separatist ship.

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,199
During their escape, our heroes crash
on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar

6
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,828
and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland called The Void.

7
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,708
Now, after surviving against all odds,
our heroes must find a way home

8
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:45,546
and deliver the encryption module
to crack the Separatist code

9
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,381
and stop an enemy attack.

10
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,887
I have never been to Tatooine,
but if this place reminds you of it, Artoo,

11
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,889
remind me never to go there.

12
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:05,065
Don't be absurd, Qutee.
These people aren't dangerous.

13
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,247
Most of these people are probably hiding
from someone or something.

14
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,959
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

15
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,210
Nobody's here by choice.

16
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,254
Which goes double for me!

17
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,258
I hope you have a plan
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

18
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,427
Of course I do, Corporal.

19
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,306
All we need is a communications uplink
and some fuel.

20
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,310
Thank you for the reminder, Ceefor,

21
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,438
but I'm well aware
our shuttle's lost in the Void.

22
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,773
I'm talking about fuel for me!

23
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,319
You droids can putter along
on battery power,

24
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,279
but I need food to survive.

25
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,240
My power cells are running low, too.

26
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,576
And an oil bath would be nice.

27
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:00,913
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

28
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,584
Forget it, Beezee.
We're not on vacation here.

29
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,295
Artoo, is the encryption module safe?

30
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:15,093
Nothing short of death or dismemberment
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,846
from delivering that module to Coruscant.

32
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,936
Well, I'll be.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,189
A diner! A place of eating!

34
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,774
I'm saved!

35
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,652
Artoo! You and the other mechs
scout the perimeter,

36
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,780
find out if there are
any unfriendlies around.

37
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:39,493
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

38
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,301
Good day.

39
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:04,184
I am Colonel Gascon
of the Grand Army of the Republic,

40
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,145
and I am here on very important business.

41
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,362
I don't have much time,

42
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,532
so if you'll be so kind
as to fix me your daily special

43
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,577
- and let my droid recharge...
- No droids!

44
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:25,539
Fine.

45
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,584
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

46
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,712
We don't serve your type, either!

47
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:35,090
What type are you referring to?

48
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,968
Conduit worms.

49
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,600
I beg your pardon. I am a Zilkan!

50
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:49,479
You'll be begging for your life
if you don't beat it!

51
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,067
Beat it.

52
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,069
Uh-oh.

53
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,575
This is an outrage!

54
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:05,662
That monstrosity will rue the day
he denied me a meal!

55
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,748
I would not push it, Colonel.

56
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,417
That monstrosity might make a meal
out of you.

57
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,462
I don't care. I'm famished!

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,012
I think I can help.

59
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,943
Your meal awaits you, sir.

60
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:41,615
You short-circuiting hydrospanner.
That's no meal!

61
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,492
That is garbage!

62
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:46,370
What is the difference?
It is edible, is it not?

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,622
Ugh!

64
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,815
Oh!

65
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,150
Oh!

66
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,902
Sorry. I didn't see you there.

67
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,365
Look, I can get you some food,
but normally people come in the front door.

68
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,075
It's no problem.

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,872
You do know
that you're eating garbage, right?

70
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,001
You're a clone!

71
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,544
Excuse me?

72
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,004
Uh...

73
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,424
I wouldn't know about that.
My name's Gregor.

74
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,759
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

75
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,102
You are a clone!

76
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,770
Are you working undercover?

77
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,899
I don't know what you're talking about.

78
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,484
Listen to me, soldier.
Whatever your assignment is,

79
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,528
it can't be more important than mine.

80
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,238
It is his first real mission.

81
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,907
He is just a map reader.

82
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,367
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

83
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,954
You are a clone
and a soldier in the Republic Army,

84
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,332
and I order you to take me to your ship!

85
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:16,043
We need to get back
to Coruscant immediately.

86
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,171
Look, friend, I was just trying to help.

87
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,256
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

88
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,426
I do not think that soldier
believes you are a colonel,

89
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,053
Colonel.

90
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:29,848
Gregor! Get back to work!

91
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,519
Excuse me, I gotta go.
I don't want to lose my job.

92
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,274
But I'm still hungry!

93
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,665
Well? What's the scouting report?

94
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,546
Separatist droids? Hmm.

95
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,048
Well, that complicates matters.

96
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,346
So, uh, boss,

97
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,682
you know,
I was just wondering...

98
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,393
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

99
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,354
Oh, no, no, no, I don't want a raise.

100
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,774
I just wanted to know, what's a clone?

101
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:25,904
Someone told me I was a clone today.
They insisted.

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,948
A clone?

103
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:31,034
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

104
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,078
They are brave soldiers.

105
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,747
Does that sound like you?

106
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,334
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

107
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,838
Forget about clones or anything like that.

108
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,800
You have good life here, a simple life.

109
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,678
More than you had when Borkus found you.

110
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:53,098
I know, sir, and I appreciate
everything that you've done, believe me.

111
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:57,477
But I thought maybe you could...
Could you tell me, how did I get here?

112
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,104
Where did you find me?

113
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,690
Enough questions! Go home. Sleep!

114
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,109
Come back tomorrow, do your job.

115
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,489
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again. Understand?

116
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:25,005
Colonel, I cannot help noticing
that we are already on our third plan.

117
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,260
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

118
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,721
something droids are not known for.

119
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:38,560
Artoo is right.
Droids are not known for being flexible

120
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,480
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

121
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,815
Well, answer me this, Corporal.

122
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,693
If the Jedi Council thought
one of you droids

123
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,029
were better prepared to lead this mission,

124
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,281
then why did they put me in charge?

125
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,618
'Cause you're the only one
who could fit inside Beezee.

126
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,415
No, it is because
my power of deduction told me

127
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,460
that if there are Separatist droids
on Abafar,

128
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,380
then there must be a landing zone nearby,

129
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:09,508
where there will be, no doubt,
a shuttle to take us home.

130
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,929
That, Corporal, is why I am in charge.

131
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,935
Now, we are going to waltz down there,

132
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,938
undetected, just like we did
on the dreadnought,

133
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,191
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

134
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,070
The mechs have a point, Colonel.

135
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,864
After what we did on the dreadnought,

136
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,950
those battle droids probably have
our identities scanned.

137
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,911
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

138
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:40,205
Mmm, you droids may have a point.

139
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,835
But there's no way in Malachor
that I'm gonna lead this pitiful squad

140
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,379
on an assault of that landing zone.

141
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,047
What is the plan now, Colonel?

142
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:53,051
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

143
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:57,139
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

144
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,694
- Captain Rex, reporting for duty.
- What?

145
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,202
I...

146
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,205
I don't understand. That's...

147
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,834
- Me?
- No, that's Captain Rex.

148
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:11,547
He's a clone in the Republic Army,
just like you, Gregor.

149
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,174
I can't believe it.

150
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,969
Okay, slow down, slow down.

151
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:21,390
So you're telling me
that there are more of these clones.

152
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,851
Millions. A whole army's worth.

153
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,811
Aha.

154
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:30,774
- And they all look exactly like me?
- No.

155
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:36,029
Those clones are warriors, professional
soldiers created by the Republic,

156
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,575
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

157
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,368
in our war against the Separatists.

158
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,665
They're not dishwashers
living in some vermin-infested hovel.

159
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,211
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

160
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:54,506
Mr. Borkus says
my salary doesn't even cover the rent,

161
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,926
- so he pays the difference for me.
- Don't you get it, Gregor?

162
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:01,889
You're his slave!
We need to figure out who you really are,

163
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,307
how you got here.

164
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,809
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

165
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,521
Well, all I remember

166
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:12,691
is waking up on a transport.

167
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,944
Somehow we crashed on Abafar, and...

168
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,364
Well, Mr. Borkus says I have amnesia.

169
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,869
Hmm. Every clone has an identifying code
on their wrist.

170
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,371
Your military records will be
in the database.

171
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,123
Scan him, Artoo.

172
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:36,965
Impressive.

173
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:42,846
Gregor, your designation is CC5576-39.

174
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,642
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

175
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,186
A clone commando.

176
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,566
Your file says you were reported
missing in action

177
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,861
during the Battle of Sarrish.

178
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,531
Sarrish?

179
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,158
Sarrish.

180
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,160
Wait.

181
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,788
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

182
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,792
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

183
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,544
Sarrish.

184
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,256
Yes. Yes, I remember now.

185
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,883
So many soldiers were dying.

186
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,720
Do you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

187
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:29,852
No. I just remember
seeing all those bodies.

188
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,312
Bodies everywhere.

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,566
I knew I had to get help,

190
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,735
but that's where the memory stops.

191
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:42,906
Well, soldier, there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

192
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,158
but you can help us.

193
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,619
Our mission depends on it.

194
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:59,214
Colonel, Gregor said to give him
five minutes, but it has been six.

195
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:01,842
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

196
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:06,221
Then I'll go back in there
and personally knock some sense into him!

197
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,640
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh.

198
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,979
I figured at least looking like a soldier
might bring back some more memories.

199
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,231
Until I recover my equipment, anyway.

200
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,941
I overheard you guys talking.

201
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,527
I think I know where my armor is.

202
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,987
Let's go check out the diner.

203
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,082
Step it up, soldiers! This isn't a party.

204
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,043
We do not have all night.

205
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,964
Looking for this?

206
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,180
My uniform. My equipment!

207
00:14:49,765 --> 00:14:52,559
All this time, you knew who I was
and didn't tell me?

208
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:56,647
- Why?
- I don't care who you were.

209
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,565
You are dishwasher now!

210
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,486
And you owe me
for saving you from your crash!

211
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,697
Your life is mine, Gregor.

212
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,742
You didn't save me.
You turned me into a slave!

213
00:15:09,368 --> 00:15:11,787
I've worked in this dump,
taken orders from you,

214
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,622
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic!

215
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,998
I want my life back!

216
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,709
You want your freedom, Gregor?

217
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,837
Take your gun from me.

218
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,880
Show me you are a soldier.

219
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,052
You see? You are no soldier.

220
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:29,972
You are a dishwasher!

221
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,815
Why, you no-good droids!

222
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,442
Let go of me!

223
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,034
Take your things, Gregor.
We're getting out of here.

224
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,414
Don't leave, Gregor.

225
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,624
It's a big galaxy out there.

226
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,959
Bigger than you know!

227
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,296
Stay here, where your life is simple.

228
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,464
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

229
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,425
Not for this clone.

230
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,928
Ha! You will never get off Abafar.

231
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:13,473
You and your little Republic friends.

232
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:16,310
Not after your Jedi cruiser blows up!

233
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,937
What are you talking about?

234
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:22,316
Why do you think the Separatists
bother coming here?

235
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:26,820
They are mining our Rhydonium
to load on the shuttle

236
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,614
and destroy your ride home!

237
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:35,329
You will see, you will all be stuck here,

238
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,832
begging Borkus for a job
in his diner!

239
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:02,940
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

240
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,066
Gregor?

241
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,448
Wait. There!

242
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,075
There's a cruiser up there.

243
00:17:14,243 --> 00:17:15,661
And that shuttle. I think...

244
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,912
Yes.

245
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,540
It's being loaded up
with Rhydonium canisters.

246
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,463
Ah, I guess Mr. Borkus was actually
telling the truth, for once.

247
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,799
What exactly is Rhydonium?

248
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:32,177
It's a fuel,
mostly been mined out on Abafar.

249
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,096
It's volatile and dangerous.

250
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,934
Yes, we do have a new mission.

251
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,646
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

252
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,400
I'll cover you and clear the way, Colonel.
You all head straight to the shuttle.

253
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,277
I'll take care of those clankers.

254
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:50,571
Mmm, sounds like a good plan.

255
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,407
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

256
00:17:57,995 --> 00:17:59,079
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

257
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:01,874
Let's roll.

258
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,549
Hey!

259
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,429
You need authorization to enter this area.

260
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,809
Get them!

261
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,037
Good job, Gregor!

262
00:18:46,627 --> 00:18:48,045
Look! He's up there!

263
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,515
Just keep moving! It is all under control!

264
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,691
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

265
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,490
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

266
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,616
Blast them!

267
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:19,827
They are on to us!

268
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,957
Colonel! Can you hear me?

269
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:27,835
- Save yourselves!
- Okay!

270
00:19:28,043 --> 00:19:29,211
Whoa!

271
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,421
Whoa.

272
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,976
Did everybody make it?

273
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,437
No, Beezee and the Colonel
are still out there.

274
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:49,022
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

275
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,324
Colonel! You all right?

276
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,910
I'll never make it back alive.

277
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,788
Yes, you will, sir!
This is what I was born to do.

278
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,957
Now go, before it's too late!

279
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,398
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

280
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,779
Artoo's right.
We can swing back around and pick you up.

281
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,615
Don't worry about me!

282
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,409
You made me remember who I am!

283
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:44,244
I'll make my way home. I promise!

284
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:45,496
Now go!

285
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,834
Where is Gregor?

286
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,336
Where is Gregor?

287
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:55,464
He's doing what a soldier does,

288
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,926
sacrificing himself for the lives of others.

289
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,952
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

290
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,456
We will take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

291
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,209
and we will watch for your return.

1
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,688
<i>Death and destruction!</i>

2
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:23,292
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress spread chaos</i>

3
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:25,597
<i>as they descend on the outer rim.</i>

4
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:28,373
<i>After rescuing his brother from despair,</i>

5
00:00:28,408 --> 00:00:32,156
<i>Savage and Maul murder
and pillage at every turn.</i>

6
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,526
<i>Fueled by rage and vengeance,</i>

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,963
<i>they search for meaning
in their new alliance</i>

8
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,170
<i>as reports of their brutal attacks</i>

9
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,810
<i>spread across the galaxy.</i>

10
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:08,510
Fan out.

11
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:11,687
I want a scan of the entire perimeter.

12
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:16,063
SD-357, have you found
anyone in the South passage?

13
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,610
357, where are you?

14
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:27,552
Intruders!

15
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,959
You are trespassing on intergalactic...

16
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,699
Look, brother, a fortune.

17
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:10,670
True fortune will be the demise of Kenobi.

18
00:02:10,705 --> 00:02:14,111
Credit chips are meaningless
without a plan to survive.

19
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:17,187
The Jedi are hunting us.

20
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,525
We will be forced to make a stand.

21
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:22,195
And we will deal with them.

22
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,499
They are too many.

23
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:28,441
To continue, we need one singular vision...

24
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,278
my vision.

25
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:33,449
Brother, let us share our strength.

26
00:02:34,684 --> 00:02:37,821
There is no need for dominance between us.

27
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:40,827
Always two there are, my brother,

28
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:43,866
a master and an apprentice,

29
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,067
and you are the apprentice.

30
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:56,188
So it is time for a lesson.

31
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:09,704
You have grown so powerful.

32
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,945
And I shall complete your training.

33
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,449
Not as your brother

34
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:20,574
but as your master.

35
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,932
The distress signal is coming from here,

36
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,166
the Meridian sector,

37
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:34,701
Cybloc System.

38
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:38,308
It is close enough to the earlier attack.

39
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,845
I have a feeling it's them.

40
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,091
They ought to be flush.

41
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,427
Chips were all unlocked.

42
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:54,194
No way to trace 'em.

43
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:56,828
All done by the two crabbiest Zabraks

44
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,564
this side of the Hydian.

45
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:00,568
They were alone?

46
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,670
Yup, yup.

47
00:04:01,704 --> 00:04:02,940
What were they,

48
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,412
a couple of Jedi gone rogue or something?

49
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:10,020
They're not Jedi.

50
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,088
Do me a favor.

51
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:14,191
Spark up that lightsaber, would you?

52
00:04:14,226 --> 00:04:15,359
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,095
Well, the droids that got attacked

54
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,369
said that theirs were red.

55
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:22,271
They are Sith, and we need to find them

56
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,408
before they strike again.

57
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:27,644
Well, they took my cargo ship.

58
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:29,446
The droid survivor said
they heard something

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,882
about the Sertar sector.

60
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,257
What is in the Sertar sector?

61
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:41,926
That's where Florrum is.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,127
You've been there?

63
00:04:44,162 --> 00:04:45,595
What can we expect?

64
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,631
Pirates.

65
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,852
Get me a readout on that ship.

66
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:07,187
There are life-forms aboard.

67
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,989
The main reactor and
hyperdrive generator are down.

68
00:05:11,023 --> 00:05:12,691
I think they're stranded.

69
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,529
And their communications?

70
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:19,201
Operational but silenced.

71
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,503
Mm.

72
00:05:20,537 --> 00:05:23,306
We'll kill anyone on
board and take the ship.

73
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:26,278
Let's hope they have a wealth of cargo.

74
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:50,204
Pure sansanna spices.

75
00:05:50,238 --> 00:05:52,441
Hondo will be pleased.

76
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:53,710
We drink tonight.

77
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,483
Now, find me those life-forms.

78
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,120
Jedi.

79
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,367
Do you want to live?

80
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,535
Yes, very badly.

81
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:21,047
We will make you rich.

82
00:06:21,082 --> 00:06:24,448
Your skills and talents
could serve us well.

83
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:27,016
The choice is yours.

84
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,288
Are you... are you hiring us?

85
00:06:30,322 --> 00:06:32,693
What kind of Jedi are you?

86
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,195
We are not Jedi.

87
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,063
We are lords,

88
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,264
crime lords.

89
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,334
We work for Hondo.

90
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,005
You'll have to pay us really well

91
00:06:44,073 --> 00:06:46,243
to get us to betray him.

92
00:06:46,278 --> 00:06:49,745
Money is of no object for men like us.

93
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:53,312
You will have all that you desire and more

94
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:57,321
if you pledge yourselves to me.

95
00:06:57,355 --> 00:07:00,056
All right.

96
00:07:00,091 --> 00:07:03,561
I'm tired of working for Hondo anyway.

97
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,497
I'll call up a couple of boys

98
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,467
and see if they'll join us.

99
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:20,701
I am certain captain Hondo
will never throw in with you.

100
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:23,705
Hondo's base will soon be ours,

101
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:26,043
and he will not survive this,

102
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:30,880
unless he embraces the
same choice I give you now.

103
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:35,852
Ha, I'm in.

104
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,186
So am I.

105
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,854
I am not sure.

106
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:41,323
Let's see what Hondo says about that.

107
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,635
<i>Three of your lieutenants</i>

108
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:51,076
<i>have already sworn allegiance to me.</i>

109
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:55,182
Traitors. Scum!

110
00:07:55,216 --> 00:07:56,985
I'm so proud...

111
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,662
but so betrayed.

112
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:05,668
There is a penalty for resistance.

113
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,219
<i>Let me warn you,</i>

114
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:20,186
<i>you are not the first
laser sword-wielding maniac</i>

115
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,358
<i>I've had to deal with,</i>

116
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:28,301
<i>and Hondo Ohnaka survives every time.</i>

117
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:30,736
We shall see.

118
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:45,655
We have a match on the cargo ship.

119
00:08:45,689 --> 00:08:48,760
It seems Maul and Savage have
picked up a pirate escort.

120
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:51,863
Maybe to unload the stolen cargo.

121
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,436
I'm not sure the pirate
Hondo would have an alliance

122
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,840
with Maul and his brother.

123
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:59,944
So you know this Hondo personally?

124
00:08:59,979 --> 00:09:04,014
Unfortunately, yes.

125
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:08,657
Oi, Hondo, there's a Jedi contacting you.

126
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:11,529
Says his name is Kenobi.

127
00:09:11,563 --> 00:09:12,864
Kenobi?

128
00:09:12,898 --> 00:09:14,166
Ha!

129
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,633
My, aren't we popular today?

130
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,334
Put him through. Go. Go. Go.

131
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,038
<i>Greetings, Hondo.</i>

132
00:09:22,073 --> 00:09:23,409
Greetings?

133
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:26,913
What kind of menace have
you brought to my planet now?

134
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:29,182
First, you lose this system

135
00:09:29,216 --> 00:09:30,751
and Grievous comes in

136
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:33,289
and destroys my entire stronghold,

137
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:37,194
leaving me here to just
rummage through the leftovers

138
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,599
of my once great empire.

139
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:43,938
And now these two horned men show up.

140
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:46,874
Who are these horny-headed maniacs?

141
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,380
They don't seem like normal Jedi.

142
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:52,051
<i>Not Jedi, Hondo, Sith.</i>

143
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,553
<i>We tracked them here.</i>

144
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:58,559
They just threatened to attack
with a group of my men...

145
00:09:58,593 --> 00:10:00,125
my own men!

146
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,925
Yes, we are looking at them right now,

147
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:04,628
a cargo vessel and three of your starships.

148
00:10:04,663 --> 00:10:06,565
They are heading toward you, Hondo.

149
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,237
<i>Dadada, more to the point,</i>

150
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,611
<i>are you going to help me when you get here?</i>

151
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:13,444
There's nothing we can do about your men,

152
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,412
but we can certainly do
something about the Sith.

153
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:19,083
<i>Good. I'll deal with my men.</i>

154
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:22,223
<i>You deal with those tattooed crazies.</i>

155
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:23,258
Right.

156
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:41,602
Well, that settles it.

157
00:10:41,637 --> 00:10:45,071
Those traitors are no longer my men.

158
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:57,417
I want their tongues!

159
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:28,456
The Jedi, brother, they've found us.

160
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:31,959
No, it's too soon.

161
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:34,025
My plan isn't finished yet.

162
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,226
Too soon.

163
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,538
Throwing in with pirates now?

164
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:51,540
Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen.

165
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:20,929
Ah!

166
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:36,482
No.

167
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:38,451
I have plans, Kenobi,

168
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:41,354
and you will not stand in my way this time.

169
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:06,104
No!

170
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:25,490
Kenobi, this way!

171
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,235
Take this cannon down the hole.

172
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,598
We will ambush those traitors there.

173
00:13:53,693 --> 00:13:55,358
Where are the rest of your men?

174
00:13:55,392 --> 00:13:57,326
They are setting up an ambush.

175
00:13:57,361 --> 00:13:59,062
We can use your help.

176
00:13:59,097 --> 00:14:00,731
Where is the other Jedi?

177
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:03,336
She's... she's dead.

178
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,405
She's d...

179
00:14:04,439 --> 00:14:07,544
They are too powerful for even you?

180
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:10,846
I am semi-speechless.

181
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:11,158
I think they went this way.

182
00:14:11,193 --> 00:14:13,952
- I think they went this way.
- Let's go down this hall here.

183
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,455
I shall draw the brothers away.

184
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,461
Once that's done, blast
the passageway closed.

185
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:22,298
And leave you alone with the two crazies?

186
00:14:22,332 --> 00:14:23,532
Well, okay.

187
00:14:28,277 --> 00:14:29,811
Retreat! Retreat!

188
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,081
Do not let them escape!

189
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:47,905
Now!

190
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:56,418
Surrender.

191
00:14:56,453 --> 00:15:01,390
We are two, and you are
no match for us both.

192
00:15:01,424 --> 00:15:03,426
You are mistaken.

193
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,970
Are you still willing to fight me?

194
00:15:12,005 --> 00:15:16,607
The horned men aren't
interested in helping you.

195
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:19,713
They are only interested in Kenobi.

196
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,803
They promised us wealth and power, boss.

197
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:49,471
Please forgive us.

198
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:52,007
Please don't kill us.

199
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,474
We beg of you.

200
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:54,708
Kill you?

201
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:58,080
Oh, I would not kill you.

202
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:03,589
Everyone, the horned men's ship
is filled with valuable goods.

203
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:06,093
As your restored leader,

204
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,232
I say we celebrate our reunification.

205
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,533
To the landing pad!

206
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:12,734
Right, Hondo, right!

207
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:30,982
Savage!

208
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:40,620
Come, my apprentice.

209
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,428
This plan has failed,

210
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:47,299
but we will have another opportunity.

211
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:01,849
Jiro, ready the men! We're leaving.

212
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:05,689
My men aren't going anywhere with you.

213
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,093
Look at them.

214
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,862
How powerful can they be?

215
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:12,065
They are running away from Kenobi.

216
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,802
Filth, you'll pay for your insolence.

217
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:18,206
Insolence?

218
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:19,877
We are pirates!

219
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,983
We don't even know what that means.

220
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:23,954
Open fire!

221
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,757
If we kill those two,

222
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,494
their riches will be ours!

223
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,665
Our engines have been compromised.

224
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,435
Get to the escape pod.

225
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:34,039
It's too late.

226
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:36,176
Trust me, apprentice.

227
00:18:59,658 --> 00:19:02,593
Well, Kenobi, let's get out there

228
00:19:02,627 --> 00:19:07,460
and see what riches have fallen
from the sky for me... and you.

229
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,102
Shall we?

230
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:13,840
Very well.

231
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:38,105
There's no sign of those two, boss.

232
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:43,145
Well, if the condition of
these goods is any indication,

233
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:46,082
ah, your friends have been vaporized.

234
00:19:46,117 --> 00:19:48,185
I wouldn't be so sure.

235
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,323
I cut one of them in half
once, and he survived.

236
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,525
Well, isn't that interesting?

237
00:20:00,797 --> 00:20:04,801
I think we have closure on
this matter, master Kenobi.

238
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,801
I disagree, Chancellor.

239
00:20:06,836 --> 00:20:08,302
Everything we've learned from this

240
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:10,137
is that the Sith are persistent.

241
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:11,971
They will not die.

242
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:15,075
I understand your
reservations, Master Kenobi,

243
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:17,210
but I am afraid we can no longer allow

244
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:20,847
this personal matter of yours
to be a Republic concern.

245
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:23,750
It does not appear this Darth Maul

246
00:20:23,784 --> 00:20:26,054
is a direct threat to the Republic.

247
00:20:26,089 --> 00:20:29,562
We need to redirect your
efforts to the cause at hand:

248
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:34,105
Stopping Count Dooku and
thus ending the Clone Wars.

249
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:37,542
Maul was trying to
build an army of pirates.

250
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,043
So let him.

251
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:41,146
Let him play with the rabble.

252
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,381
They're just petty crooks.

253
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,384
It is of no relevance to the senate

254
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,721
compared to the Separatist threat.

255
00:20:47,755 --> 00:20:50,525
Good day, gentlemen.

256
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:55,566
Something is stirring in the underworld.

257
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,102
The crime families have
had too much free rein

258
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:00,940
since the Jedi have been
distracted by the clone war.

259
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:04,211
I fear it is a fertile
place for Maul to flourish,

260
00:21:04,246 --> 00:21:06,013
if he has indeed survived.

261
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:09,848
Hmm, right you may be, Obi-Wan,

262
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:13,154
but heed the words of
the Chancellor we must.

263
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,926
A personal matter this is for you.

264
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,429
Clouded your judgment may be.

265
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:20,933
In time, if he lives,

266
00:21:20,965 --> 00:21:23,766
reveal himself again Maul will.

267
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,838
And then swiftly we shall act.

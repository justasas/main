1
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,634
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,101
They shut down the main reactor.
We’ll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:55,001
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:06,517
We’re doomed.

5
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,100
There’ll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,726
What’s that?

7
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,000
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:18,818
At last! Where have you been?

9
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,820
They’re heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,421
We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,
or smashed into who knows what!

11
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,259
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,700
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,713
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,813 --> 00:05:53,019
– What have you done with those plans?
– We intercepted no transmissions.

15
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,090
This is a consular ship.
We’re on a diplomatic mission.

16
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,789
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

17
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:09,132
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you’ve found those plans...

18
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:12,232
...and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

19
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,517
There’s one. Set for stun.

20
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:35,000
She’ll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

21
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,560
Hey! You’re not permitted in there.
It’s restricted.

22
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:42,262
You’ll be deactivated for sure.

23
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,738
Don’t you call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease!

24
00:06:46,838 --> 00:06:48,938
Now come out before somebody sees you.

25
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:55,677
“Secret mission”? What plans? What are
you talking about? I’m not getting in there.

26
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,383
I’m going to regret this.

27
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,427
– There goes another one.
– Hold your fire.

28
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:12,465
There’s no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.

29
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,065
That’s funny. The damage
doesn’t look as bad from out here.

30
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,300
Are you sure this thing is safe?

31
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,507
Oh.

32
00:07:39,224 --> 00:07:41,825
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

33
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,365
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you’ve attacked a diplomatic—

34
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,666
Don’t act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren’t on any mercy mission this time.

35
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:53,740
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

36
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,709
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

37
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,610
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

38
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,914
I’m a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

39
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,884
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

40
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,984
Take her away!

41
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,524
Holding her is dangerous.
If word of this gets out...

42
00:08:13,624 --> 00:08:16,227
...it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the Senate.

43
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:21,428
I’ve traced the rebel spies to her. Now she is
my only link to finding their secret base.

44
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,701
– She’ll die before she’ll tell you anything.
– Leave that to me.

45
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:29,409
Send a distress signal and then inform
the Senate that all aboard were killed.

46
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,801
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

47
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:34,707
...and no transmissions were made.

48
00:08:34,807 --> 00:08:38,308
An escape pod was jettisoned during
the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

49
00:08:38,408 --> 00:08:40,849
She must have hidden the plans
in the escape pod.

50
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:44,791
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

51
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:48,600
– There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
– Yes, sir.

52
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,277
How did we get into this mess?

53
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,741
I really don’t know how.

54
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,313
We seem to be made to suffer.
It’s our lot in life.

55
00:09:14,452 --> 00:09:17,852
I’ve got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

56
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:27,663
What a desolate place this is!

57
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,339
Where do you think you’re going?

58
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,440
Well, I’m not going that way.

59
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,540
It’s much too rocky.
This way is much easier.

60
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:42,477
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

61
00:09:44,078 --> 00:09:45,978
Don’t get technical with me.

62
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,884
What mission? What are you talking about?

63
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:53,756
I’ve just about had enough of you.

64
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:58,597
Go that way. You’ll be malfunctioning
within a day, you nearsighted scrap pile.

65
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:03,100
And don’t let me catch you following me
begging for help, because you won’t get it.

66
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,230
No more adventures.
I’m not going that way.

67
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,701
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

68
00:10:58,801 --> 00:11:02,702
He tricked me into going this way,
but he’ll do no better.

69
00:11:06,765 --> 00:11:11,203
Wait! What’s that?
A transport! I’m saved!

70
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,803
Over here!
Hey! Hey!

71
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,602
Help! Please help!

72
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:51,354
R2?

73
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:57,592
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

74
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:19,814
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

75
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,987
Look, sir. Droids.

76
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,666
Wake up! Wake up!

77
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:44,373
We’re doomed.

78
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:55,083
Do you think they’ll melt us down?

79
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,999
Don’t shoot!
Don’t shoot!

80
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,568
Will this never end?

81
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,045
All right, fine. Let’s go.

82
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,306
Luke! Luke!

83
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,650
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

84
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:07,322
Doesn’t look like we have much
of a choice, but I’ll remind him.

85
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:20,768
Yeah, we’ll take that red one.
No, not that one.

86
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,709
You, I suppose you’re programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

87
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,549
Protocol? Why, it’s my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs—

88
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,551
– I have no need for a protocol droid.
– Of course you haven’t, sir.

89
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:36,555
Not in an environment such as this.
That is why I have been programmed—

90
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:41,956
What I really need is a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

91
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:44,327
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

92
00:17:44,427 --> 00:17:47,028
...very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

93
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,900
– Can you speak Bocce?
– Of course I can, sir. It’s like...

94
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,100
– ...a second language to me. I’m as fluent—
– Yeah, all right. Shut up. I’ll take this one. Luke!

95
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,111
Take these two over to the garage, will you?
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

96
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,647
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

97
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,648
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

98
00:18:04,748 --> 00:18:09,180
– Now come on. Get to it.
– All right. Come on.

99
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,949
And the red one. Come on.

100
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,662
Well, come on, red. Let’s go.

101
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,580
– Uncle Owen!
– Yeah?

102
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,481
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

103
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,199
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

104
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:51,523
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

105
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,499
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

106
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,902
What about that blue one?
We’ll take that one.

107
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,305
– Yeah, take this away.
– You’ll be very pleased with that one, sir.

108
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:04,305
He really is in first-class condition.
I’ve worked with him before.

109
00:19:04,405 --> 00:19:06,205
Here he comes.

110
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,149
Okay, let’s go.

111
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,886
Now, don’t you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you...

112
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,986
...is quite beyond my capacity.

113
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:26,129
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

114
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,600
I’ve got such a bad case
of dust contamination, I can barely move.

115
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:35,841
It just isn’t fair. Oh, Biggs is right.
I’m never gonna get out of here.

116
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:40,142
– Is there anything I might do to help?
– No. Not unless you can alter time...

117
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:43,242
...speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

118
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,686
I don’t think so, sir. I’m only a droid, and
not very knowledgeable about such things...

119
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:53,025
...not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of fact,
I’m not even sure which planet I’m on.

120
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:58,063
Well, if there’s a bright center to the universe,
you’re on the planet that it’s farthest from.

121
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,166
– I see, sir.
– You can call me Luke.

122
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,266
I see, Sir Luke.

123
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,532
Just Luke.

124
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:11,132
Oh. And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

125
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,209
Hello.

126
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:18,650
You’ve got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

127
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,101
With all we’ve been through,
sometimes I’m amazed...

128
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:24,000
...we’re in as good condition as we are,
what with the rebellion and all.

129
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,824
You know of the rebellion against the Empire?!

130
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,124
That’s how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

131
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,926
– Have you been in many battles?
– Several, I think.

132
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:35,801
Actually, there’s not much to tell.
I’m not much more than an interpreter...

133
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:40,169
...and not very good at telling stories.
Well, not at making them interesting, anyway.

134
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:45,174
Well, my little friend, you’ve got something
jammed in here real good.

135
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,244
Were you on a Starcruiser or—

136
00:20:47,545 --> 00:20:50,748
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

137
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,449
What’s this?

138
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,521
“What is what”? He asked you a question.
What is that?

139
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:59,316
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

140
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,593
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

141
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,505
Oh. He says it’s nothing, sir. Merely
a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.

142
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,008
Who is she?
She’s beautiful.

143
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,478
I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.

144
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,980
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

145
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,283
A person of some importances, I believe.
Our captain was attached to—

146
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,483
Is there any more to this recording?

147
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:31,657
Behave yourself, R2.
You’re going to get us into trouble.

148
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,799
It’s all right. You can trust him.
He’s our new master.

149
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,732
He says that he’s the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

150
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:44,236
...a resident of these parts,
and it’s a private message for him.

151
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:46,305
Quite frankly, sir, I don’t know what
he’s talking about.

152
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,901
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we’ve been through...

153
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,201
...this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

154
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,381
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

155
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,151
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he’s talking about?

156
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,999
Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan,
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

157
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,000
He’s kind of a strange old hermit.

158
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:10,762
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she’s in trouble.

159
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:12,862
I better play back the whole thing.

160
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,866
He says the restraining bolt
has short-circuited his recording system.

161
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,501
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

162
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,744
...he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

163
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,546
Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...

164
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:30,082
...I guess you’re too small
to run away on me...

165
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,282
...if I take this off. Okay...

166
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,220
There you go.

167
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,782
Wait a minute. Where’d she go?
Bring her back. Play back the entire message.

168
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:45,385
“What message”?
The one you’ve just been playing!

169
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:47,400
The one you’re carrying
inside your rusty innards.

170
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,626
Luke! Luke!

171
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:53,201
– All right, I’ll be right there, Aunt Beru.
– I’m sorry, sir...

172
00:22:53,301 --> 00:22:55,641
...but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

173
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:59,170
Here. See what you can do with him.
I’ll be right back.

174
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:04,501
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

175
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,000
No, I don’t think he likes you at all.

176
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,920
No, I don’t like you, either.

177
00:23:19,229 --> 00:23:22,065
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

178
00:23:22,165 --> 00:23:23,768
What makes you think that?

179
00:23:23,868 --> 00:23:25,804
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

180
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,873
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

181
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:35,411
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he’s talking about?

182
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:41,981
– I wonder if he’s related to Ben.
– That wizard’s just a crazy old man.

183
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:46,080
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit
to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

184
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,860
That’ll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

185
00:23:50,161 --> 00:23:53,201
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

186
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:58,701
He won’t. I don’t think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

187
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,070
– He knew my father?
– I told you to forget it.

188
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

189
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,849
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

190
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:12,049
– ...working on those condensers.
– Yes, sir.

191
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:15,887
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

192
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:19,424
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

193
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:23,401
...about me staying on another season...

194
00:24:23,501 --> 00:24:26,700
...and if these new droids do work out,
I want to transmit my application...

195
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,701
– ...to the academy this year.
– You mean the next semester...

196
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,001
– ...before the harvest?
– Sure. There’s more than enough droids.

197
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:35,301
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It’s only one season more.

198
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,301
This year we’ll make enough on the harvest
that I’ll be able to hire some more hands...

199
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:44,882
...and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

200
00:24:44,982 --> 00:24:47,719
– But it’s a whole ’nother year!
– Look, it’s only one more season.

201
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,220
Yeah, that’s what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

202
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,721
– Where are you going?
– Looks like I’m going nowhere.

203
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,500
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

204
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,959
Owen, he can’t stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

205
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:03,057
– It means so much to him.
– I’ll make it up to him next year. I promise.

206
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:08,697
Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

207
00:25:09,073 --> 00:25:11,573
That’s what I’m afraid of.

208
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,059
What are you doing hiding back there?

209
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,996
It wasn’t my fault, sir.
Please don’t deactivate me.

210
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,197
I told him not to go,
but he’s faulty, malfunctioning.

211
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:11,801
– Kept babbling on about his mission.
– Oh, no.

212
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:23,045
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

213
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:25,101
These astrodroids are getting
quite out of hand.

214
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:27,500
Even I can’t understand their logic at times.

215
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,313
How could I be so stupid?
He’s nowhere in sight. Blast it!

216
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,090
– Pardon me, sir, but couldn’t we go after him?
– It’s too dangerous...

217
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:37,200
...with all the Sand People around.
We’ll have to wait until morning.

218
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,500
Luke! I’m shutting the power down.

219
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,124
All right! I’ll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.

220
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,071
You know, that little droid’s gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

221
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:48,571
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

222
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,284
Luke?
Luke! Luke!

223
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,998
Have you seen Luke this morning?

224
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,501
He said he had some things to do
before he started today, so he left early.

225
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:20,000
– Did he take those two new droids with him?
– I think so.

226
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,301
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

227
00:27:22,401 --> 00:27:24,941
...repaired by midday,
or there’ll be hell to pay.

228
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,513
Lookit, there’s a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

229
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,741
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

230
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,970
Hey, whoa! Just where do
you think you’re going?

231
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:59,501
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

232
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:03,101
We’ll have no more of this
Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

233
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,452
And don’t talk to me of your mission, either.
You’re fortunate he doesn’t blast you...

234
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:10,046
– ...into a million pieces right here!
– No. It’s all right, but I think we’d better go.

235
00:28:12,046 --> 00:28:13,625
What’s wrong with him now?

236
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,525
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

237
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:19,126
Sand People, or worse.

238
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,865
Come on, let’s go have a look.
Come on!

239
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:28,271
Well, there are two Banthas down there...

240
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:30,664
...but I don’t see any...
Wait a second.

241
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:34,973
They’re Sand People, all right.
I can see one of them now.

242
00:29:49,553 --> 00:29:51,353
Hello, there.

243
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:56,190
Come here, my little friend.
Don’t be afraid.

244
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:01,029
Oh, don’t worry.
He’ll be all right.

245
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:09,371
Rest easy, son.
You’ve had a busy day.

246
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,171
You’re fortunate to be all in one piece.

247
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:18,605
Ben?
Ben Kenobi?

248
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,185
Boy, am I glad to see you.

249
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:24,285
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

250
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,100
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

251
00:30:31,801 --> 00:30:33,901
This little droid.

252
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,901
I think he’s searching for his former master,
but I’ve never seen such devotion...

253
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:40,001
...in a droid before.

254
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,767
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

255
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,577
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he’s talking about?

256
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:52,145
Obi-Wan Kenobi?
Obi-Wan.

257
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:58,645
Now, that’s a name
I’ve not heard in a long time.

258
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:01,223
A long time.

259
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:05,219
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

260
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,392
Oh, he’s not dead.
Not yet.

261
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:12,936
– You know him?
– Well, of course I know him. He’s me.

262
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,877
I haven’t gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

263
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,445
...since, oh, before you were born.

264
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,614
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

265
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:26,110
I don’t seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

266
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,619
Very interesting.

267
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,961
I think we’d better get indoors.
The Sand People are easily startled...

268
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,662
...but they’ll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

269
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,467
3PO.

270
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:56,211
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

271
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:00,718
Can you stand? We’ve got to get out of here
before the Sand People return.

272
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,321
I don’t think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

273
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,124
There’s no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

274
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,324
I’m done for.

275
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,457
– No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?
– Quickly. They’re on the move.

276
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:21,472
No, my father didn’t fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

277
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,341
That’s what your uncle told you.

278
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,377
He didn’t hold with your father’s ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here...

279
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,342
...and not gotten involved.

280
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,384
– You fought in the Clone Wars?
– Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

281
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,584
...the same as your father.

282
00:32:37,855 --> 00:32:42,555
– I wish I’d known him.
– He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

283
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,929
...and a cunning warrior.

284
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,594
I understand you’ve become
quite a good pilot yourself.

285
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,864
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...

286
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,300
...I have something here for you.

287
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,700
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

288
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,350
...but your uncle wouldn’t allow it.

289
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,720
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...

290
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,589
...like your father did.

291
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,992
Sir, if you’ll not be needing me,
I’ll close down for a while.

292
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,092
Sure. Go ahead.

293
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,895
– What is it?
– Your father’s lightsaber.

294
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:25,236
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

295
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,240
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

296
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:35,245
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

297
00:33:36,313 --> 00:33:39,550
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

298
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,744
...of peace and justice in the old Republic...

299
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,384
...before the dark times...
before the Empire.

300
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,100
How did my father die?

301
00:33:54,831 --> 00:33:57,200
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

302
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,964
...who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

303
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,099
...helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

304
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,543
He betrayed and murdered your father.

305
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,479
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

306
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:17,354
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

307
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:20,022
The Force?

308
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:23,000
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

309
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,131
It’s an energy field created
by all living things.

310
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,792
It surrounds us, penetrates us,
it binds the galaxy together.

311
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,372
Now let’s see if we can’t figure out
what you are, my little friend...

312
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,880
...and where you come from.

313
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,085
– I saw part of a message he w—
– I seem to have found it.

314
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,451
<i>General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

315
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:55,092
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

316
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:58,196
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father’s request to you in person.</i>

317
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,064
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack...</i>

318
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,100
<i>...and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

319
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,104
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

320
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:10,004
<i>...into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

321
00:35:10,574 --> 00:35:14,437
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

322
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,012
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

323
00:35:17,313 --> 00:35:20,375
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You’re my only hope.</i>

324
00:35:35,499 --> 00:35:39,431
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you’re to come with me to Alderaan.

325
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,904
Alderaan?
I’m not going to Alderaan.

326
00:35:43,073 --> 00:35:45,509
I’ve got to get home. It’s late.
I’m in for it as it is.

327
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:48,009
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

328
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:51,107
I’m getting too old for this sort of thing.

329
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:59,486
I can’t get involved.
I’ve got work to do.

330
00:36:00,157 --> 00:36:04,657
It’s not that I like the Empire. I hate it,
but there’s nothing I can do about it right now.

331
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:10,400
– It’s all such a long way from here.
– That’s your uncle talking.

332
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,395
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

333
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,171
Learn about the Force, Luke.

334
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,000
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

335
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:29,109
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.

336
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:32,713
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

337
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:44,067
Until this battle station
is fully operational, we are vulnerable.

338
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:48,295
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They’re more dangerous than you realize.

339
00:36:48,972 --> 00:36:53,103
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...
not to this battle station.

340
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:57,315
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate—

341
00:36:57,415 --> 00:37:01,119
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

342
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,314
I have just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

343
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:09,627
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

344
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,427
That’s impossible.

345
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:14,264
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

346
00:37:14,364 --> 00:37:18,564
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

347
00:37:19,336 --> 00:37:22,697
Fear will keep the local systems in line...

348
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,144
– ...fear of this battle station.
– And what of the rebellion?

349
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,547
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

350
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:33,781
...it is possible, however unlikely, that they
might find a weakness and exploit it.

351
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:38,117
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

352
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,625
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

353
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,551
...would be a useless gesture, no matter
what technical data they’ve obtained.

354
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:48,292
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

355
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,966
I suggest we use it.

356
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:54,601
Don’t be too proud of this
technological terror you’ve constructed.

357
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,375
The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant...

358
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:00,444
...next to the power of the Force.

359
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:04,002
Don’t try to frighten us with
your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader.

360
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:06,951
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

361
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:09,642
...has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

362
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,052
...or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels’ hidden fortr—

363
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:22,864
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

364
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,397
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

365
00:38:27,671 --> 00:38:29,371
As you wish.

366
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:33,442
This bickering is pointless.

367
00:38:34,711 --> 00:38:38,182
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

368
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:41,118
...by the time this station is operational.

369
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:45,121
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

370
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,898
It looks like the Sand People
did this, all right.

371
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,733
Look. There’s gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

372
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,302
It’s just, I’ve never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

373
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,772
They didn’t...
but we are meant to think they did.

374
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:06,043
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sand People always ride single file...

375
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,045
...to hide their numbers.

376
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,881
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

377
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:15,379
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sand People.

378
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:19,082
Only Imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

379
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,356
But why would Imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

380
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:30,401
If they traced the robots here, they
may have learned who they sold them to...

381
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,701
...and that would lead them back... home!

382
00:39:33,436 --> 00:39:36,405
Wait, Luke!
It’s too dangerous!

383
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:04,168
Uncle Owen!
Aunt Beru!

384
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,368
Uncle Owen!

385
00:40:55,218 --> 00:41:00,520
And now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

386
00:41:43,666 --> 00:41:46,736
There’s nothing you could
have done, Luke, had you been there.

387
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:51,400
You’d have been killed, too, and the droids
would now be in the hands of the Empire.

388
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,475
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

389
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,383
There’s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force...

390
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,883
...and become a Jedi like my father.

391
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,200
Mos Eisley spaceport.

392
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:24,436
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

393
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:27,108
We must be cautious.

394
00:42:43,326 --> 00:42:45,562
– How long have you had these droids?
– About three or four seasons.

395
00:42:45,662 --> 00:42:48,162
They’re up for sale if you want them.

396
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:52,767
– Let me see your identification.
– You don’t need to see his identification.

397
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:57,672
– We don’t need to see his identification.
– These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.

398
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:01,110
These aren’t the droids we’re looking for.

399
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,410
He can go about his business.

400
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,773
– You can go about your business.
– Move along.

401
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,850
Move along.
Move along.

402
00:43:20,897 --> 00:43:23,633
I can’t abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

403
00:43:25,001 --> 00:43:26,901
Go on, go on.

404
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:31,508
I can’t understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

405
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:35,812
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

406
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,552
Do you really think we’re gonna find a pilot
here that’ll take us to Alderaan?

407
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:45,189
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

408
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:48,553
...only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.

409
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,226
I’m ready for anything.

410
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:56,731
Come along, R2.

411
00:44:47,216 --> 00:44:50,421
– Hey! We don’t serve their kind here.
– What?

412
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,790
Your droids, they’ll have to wait outside.
We don’t want them here.

413
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,226
Why don’t you wait out by the speeder?
We don’t want any trouble.

414
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,226
I heartily agree with you, sir.

415
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,571
I’ll have one of those.

416
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:47,941
– He doesn’t like you.
– I’m sorry.

417
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:51,111
I don’t like you, either.

418
00:45:51,514 --> 00:45:57,217
You just watch yourself. We’re wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

419
00:45:57,587 --> 00:45:59,389
I’ll be careful.

420
00:45:59,489 --> 00:46:02,858
– You’ll be dead!
– This little one’s not worth the effort.

421
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,400
Come, let me get you something.

422
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,200
No blasters! No blasters!

423
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:34,055
I’m all right.

424
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,753
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

425
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:46,799
I don’t like the look of this.

426
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:04,851
Han Solo. I’m captain
of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.

427
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:08,522
Chewie here tells me you’re looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

428
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,000
Yes, indeed, if it’s a fast ship.

429
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:14,670
Fast ship? You’ve never heard
of the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?

430
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,500
Should I have?

431
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,463
It’s the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

432
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:25,843
I’ve outrun Imperial starships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

433
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:28,543
I’m talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

434
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,500
She’s fast enough for you, old man.

435
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,500
– What’s the cargo?
– Only passengers...

436
00:47:36,051 --> 00:47:38,811
Myself, the boy, two droids...

437
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:42,089
...and no questions asked.

438
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,462
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

439
00:47:45,562 --> 00:47:47,750
Let’s just say we’d like to avoid...

440
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:50,266
...any Imperial entanglements.

441
00:47:51,834 --> 00:47:54,134
Well, that’s the real trick, isn’t it?

442
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:57,604
And it’s gonna cost you something extra.

443
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,708
Ten thousand, all in advance.

444
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:03,745
Ten thousand?

445
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,980
We could almost buy our own ship for that!

446
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,201
– But who’s gonna fly it, kid? You?
– You bet I could.

447
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:13,989
I’m not such a bad pilot myself.
We don’t have to sit here and listen...

448
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:17,161
We can pay you two thousand now...

449
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:20,321
...plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

450
00:48:21,397 --> 00:48:23,097
Seventeen, huh?

451
00:48:26,234 --> 00:48:28,538
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

452
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:31,200
We’ll leave as soon as you’re ready.
Docking Bay 94.

453
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,000
Ninety-four.

454
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:38,582
Looks like somebody’s beginning to
take an interest in your handiwork.

455
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,809
All right. We’ll check it out.

456
00:48:52,895 --> 00:48:54,896
Seventeen thousand!

457
00:48:54,996 --> 00:48:57,901
Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.

458
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:00,671
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

459
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,339
You’ll have to sell your speeder.

460
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,012
That’s okay. I’m never coming back
to this planet again.

461
00:49:08,781 --> 00:49:11,485
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

462
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:13,485
Tell Jabba that I’ve got his money.

463
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,569
Yeah, but this time I’ve got the money.

464
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:36,139
I don’t have it with me. Tell Jabba—

465
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:48,512
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

466
00:49:53,192 --> 00:49:54,660
Over my dead body.

467
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:02,333
Yes, I’ll bet you have.

468
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:18,015
Sorry about the mess.

469
00:50:26,692 --> 00:50:29,663
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

470
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:32,857
It’ll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

471
00:50:33,332 --> 00:50:35,268
The final checkout is completed.

472
00:50:35,368 --> 00:50:38,537
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?

473
00:50:39,405 --> 00:50:42,775
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

474
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,277
What do you mean?

475
00:50:44,377 --> 00:50:47,614
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

476
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,100
– Set your course for Alderaan.
– With pleasure.

477
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,250
Lock the door, R2.

478
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:57,987
All right, check this side of the street.

479
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:04,224
The door’s locked.
Move on to the next one.

480
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:14,807
I would much rather have gone
with Master Luke than stay here with you.

481
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:18,099
I don’t know what all this trouble is about,
but I’m sure it must be your fault.

482
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,612
You watch your language.

483
00:51:22,815 --> 00:51:25,652
All right. Give it to me.
I’ll take it.

484
00:51:25,752 --> 00:51:29,356
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38 came out,
they just aren’t in demand.

485
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:31,256
It’ll be enough.

486
00:51:48,575 --> 00:51:52,075
If the ship’s as fast as he’s boasting,
we ought to do well.

487
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,402
What a piece of junk!

488
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,632
She’ll make .5 past light speed.

489
00:52:18,905 --> 00:52:21,941
She may not look like much,
but she’s got it where it counts, kid.

490
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,744
I’ve made a lot of
special modifications myself.

491
00:52:24,844 --> 00:52:28,937
But we’re a little rushed, so if you’ll
just get on board we’ll get outta here.

492
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,020
Hello, sir.

493
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,030
Which way?

494
00:52:47,066 --> 00:52:49,266
All right, men, load your weapons.

495
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,570
Stop that ship!
Blast them!

496
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:05,382
Chewie, get us out of here!

497
00:53:06,819 --> 00:53:10,185
Oh, my. I’d forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

498
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:27,006
Looks like an Imperial cruiser.

499
00:53:27,106 --> 00:53:29,542
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought. Try and hold ’em off.

500
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:33,643
Angle the deflector shields while I make
the calculations for the jump to light speed.

501
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:46,326
Stay sharp. There’s two more coming in.
They’re gonna try and cut us off.

502
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,261
Why don’t you outrun ’em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

503
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:50,896
Watch your mouth, kid, or you’re
gonna find yourself floating home.

504
00:53:50,996 --> 00:53:53,900
We’ll be safe enough once we
make the jump to hyperspace.

505
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,200
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We’ll lose ’em.

506
00:54:00,673 --> 00:54:02,133
Here’s where the fun begins.

507
00:54:02,233 --> 00:54:04,277
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

508
00:54:04,377 --> 00:54:07,013
It’ll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

509
00:54:07,113 --> 00:54:08,948
Are you kidding?
At the rate they’re gaining?

510
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:11,818
Traveling through hyperspace
ain’t like dustin’ crops, boy!

511
00:54:11,918 --> 00:54:14,220
Without precise calculations,
we’d fly right through a star...

512
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,788
...or bounce too close to a supernova...

513
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:18,357
...and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn’t it?

514
00:54:18,457 --> 00:54:20,758
– What’s that flashing?
– We’re losing a deflector shield.

515
00:54:20,858 --> 00:54:23,658
Go strap yourselves in.
I’m gonna make the jump to light speed.

516
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,250
We’ve entered the Alderaan system.

517
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:51,757
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader’s leash.

518
00:54:52,224 --> 00:54:55,484
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

519
00:54:57,096 --> 00:54:58,896
Charming to the last.

520
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:03,736
You don’t know how hard I found it,
signing the order to terminate your life.

521
00:55:03,836 --> 00:55:07,173
I’m surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

522
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:11,411
Princess Leia, before your execution,
I would like you to be my guest...

523
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:15,140
...at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

524
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:18,342
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

525
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:21,053
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

526
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:23,723
...the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

527
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:26,815
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

528
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:32,262
In a way, you have determined the choice
of the planet that will be destroyed first.

529
00:55:33,132 --> 00:55:37,437
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

530
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:40,240
...I have chosen to test this station’s
destructive power...

531
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,409
...on your home planet of Alderaan.

532
00:55:43,509 --> 00:55:46,145
No! Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons. You can’t possibly—

533
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:50,972
You would prefer another target?
A military target? Then name the system.

534
00:55:53,085 --> 00:55:56,286
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

535
00:55:57,056 --> 00:55:59,156
Where is the rebel base?

536
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:04,962
Dantooine.

537
00:56:05,564 --> 00:56:08,401
– They’re on Dantooine.
– There. You see, Lord Vader?

538
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:12,999
She can be reasonable. Continue with
the operation. You may fire when ready.

539
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,408
– What?
– You’re far too trusting.

540
00:56:15,508 --> 00:56:19,512
Dantooine is too remote to make
an effective demonstration, but don’t worry.

541
00:56:19,612 --> 00:56:22,515
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

542
00:56:22,615 --> 00:56:24,115
No!

543
00:56:25,751 --> 00:56:27,751
Commence primary ignition.

544
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:53,577
Are you all right?
What’s wrong?

545
00:56:53,946 --> 00:56:56,249
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

546
00:56:56,349 --> 00:56:59,652
...as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror...

547
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:04,219
...and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.

548
00:57:06,091 --> 00:57:08,691
You’d better get on with your exercises.

549
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,464
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those Imperial slugs.

550
00:57:13,564 --> 00:57:15,764
I told you I’d outrun them.

551
00:57:19,205 --> 00:57:21,298
Don’t everybody thank me at once.

552
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:25,868
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

553
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,183
Now be careful, R2.

554
00:57:44,864 --> 00:57:47,364
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can’t help you.

555
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:49,769
Let him have it. It’s not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

556
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:52,069
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

557
00:57:52,438 --> 00:57:55,174
That’s ’cause a droid don’t pull
people’s arms out of their sockets...

558
00:57:55,274 --> 00:57:58,868
...when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.

559
00:58:01,413 --> 00:58:03,105
I see your point, sir.

560
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:06,307
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

561
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:28,435
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

562
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:33,511
– You mean it controls your actions?
– Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

563
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,120
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

564
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,949
...for a good blaster at your side, kid.

565
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:46,324
You don’t believe in the Force, do you?

566
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:48,694
Kid, I’ve flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

567
00:58:48,794 --> 00:58:51,901
I’ve seen a lot of strange stuff,
but I’ve never seen anything...

568
00:58:52,001 --> 00:58:56,391
...to make me believe there’s one
all-powerful force controlling everything.

569
00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:00,606
There’s no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

570
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:03,901
It’s all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

571
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:07,501
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

572
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,715
This time, let go your conscious self...

573
00:59:12,852 --> 00:59:14,813
...and act on instinct.

574
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:18,224
With the blast shield down,
I can’t even see.

575
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:19,925
How am I supposed to fight?

576
00:59:20,025 --> 00:59:22,825
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don’t trust them.

577
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:33,837
Stretch out with your feelings.

578
00:59:48,487 --> 00:59:52,117
– You see? You can do it.
– I call it luck.

579
00:59:52,291 --> 00:59:54,853
In my experience,
there’s no such thing as luck.

580
00:59:55,427 --> 01:00:00,331
Look, good against remotes is one thing.
Good against the living, that’s something else.

581
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,034
Looks like we’re coming up on Alderaan.

582
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:09,608
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

583
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:14,242
That’s good.
You’ve taken your first step into a larger world.

584
01:00:19,384 --> 01:00:22,755
– Yes?
– Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

585
01:00:22,855 --> 01:00:24,757
They found the remains of a rebel base...

586
01:00:24,857 --> 01:00:27,226
...but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

587
01:00:27,326 --> 01:00:30,887
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

588
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,989
She lied. She lied to us!

589
01:00:34,566 --> 01:00:38,966
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

590
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:41,807
Terminate her... immediately.

591
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:47,510
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

592
01:00:50,115 --> 01:00:51,715
What the...?

593
01:00:54,753 --> 01:00:56,555
We’ve come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

594
01:00:56,655 --> 01:00:59,500
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It’s not on any of the charts.

595
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:02,825
– What’s going on?
– Our position’s correct, except no Alderaan.

596
01:01:03,095 --> 01:01:05,358
– What do you mean? Where is it?
– That’s what I’m trying to tell you, kid.

597
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,032
It ain’t there. It’s been totally blown away.

598
01:01:07,132 --> 01:01:09,835
– What? How?
– Destroyed by the Empire.

599
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:12,037
The entire starfleet couldn’t destroy
the whole planet.

600
01:01:12,137 --> 01:01:13,998
It would take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I’ve—

601
01:01:15,999 --> 01:01:17,476
There’s another ship coming in.

602
01:01:17,576 --> 01:01:20,600
– Maybe they know what happened.
– It’s an Imperial fighter.

603
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,783
– It followed us!
– No. It’s a short-range fighter.

604
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:27,883
There aren’t any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

605
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:32,925
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we’re in big trouble.

606
01:01:33,025 --> 01:01:35,126
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

607
01:01:35,226 --> 01:01:37,328
It would be as well to let it go.
It’s too far out of range.

608
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:39,228
Not for long.

609
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,698
A fighter that size couldn’t get
this deep into space on its own.

610
01:01:45,971 --> 01:01:48,507
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

611
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:51,402
Well, he ain’t gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

612
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:55,447
Look at him.
He’s heading for that small moon.

613
01:01:55,547 --> 01:01:58,448
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He’s almost in range.

614
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:02,054
That’s no moon.

615
01:02:02,154 --> 01:02:05,553
– It’s a space station.
– It’s too big to be a space station.

616
01:02:08,861 --> 01:02:11,296
I have a very bad feeling about this.

617
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:13,165
Turn the ship around.

618
01:02:13,265 --> 01:02:17,762
Yeah. I think you’re right. Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

619
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:24,475
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!

620
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,580
Why are we still moving towards it?!

621
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,482
We’re caught in a tractor beam.
It’s pulling us in!

622
01:02:30,582 --> 01:02:33,452
– There’s got to be something you can do!
– There’s nothing I can do about it, kid.

623
01:02:33,552 --> 01:02:37,552
I’m full power. I’m gonna have to shut down.
They’re not gonna get me without a fight.

624
01:02:41,226 --> 01:02:44,789
You can’t win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

625
01:03:01,413 --> 01:03:03,549
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

626
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:06,049
<i>We’re opening the magnetic field.</i>

627
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:23,298
To your stations!
Come with me.

628
01:03:27,206 --> 01:03:30,831
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

629
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:34,680
– Yes?
– <i>We’ve captured a freighter...</i>

630
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,981
<i>...entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

631
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:40,686
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

632
01:03:40,786 --> 01:03:44,323
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

633
01:03:44,423 --> 01:03:47,392
She may yet be of some use to us.

634
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:56,057
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.</i>
<i>Release charge.</i>

635
01:03:57,903 --> 01:04:00,030
<i>316, report to control.</i>

636
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:05,376
There’s no one on board, sir.

637
01:04:05,476 --> 01:04:08,476
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

638
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:11,450
It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the
escape pods have been jettisoned.

639
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,485
– Did you find any droids?
– No, sir.

640
01:04:13,585 --> 01:04:15,420
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

641
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:18,957
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

642
01:04:19,057 --> 01:04:20,458
Yes, sir.

643
01:04:20,558 --> 01:04:24,652
I sense something...
a presence I’ve not felt since...

644
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:31,399
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked.

645
01:04:50,455 --> 01:04:52,391
Boy, it’s lucky you had these compartments.

646
01:04:52,491 --> 01:04:55,690
I use them for smuggling.
I never thought I’d be smuggling myself in ’em.

647
01:04:55,961 --> 01:04:58,497
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off...

648
01:04:58,597 --> 01:05:01,466
– ...I’d never get past the tractor beam.
– Leave that to me.

649
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:04,436
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

650
01:05:04,536 --> 01:05:07,996
Who’s the more foolish, the fool
or the fool who follows him?

651
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:22,186
The ship’s all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

652
01:05:23,054 --> 01:05:24,754
All right, let’s go.

653
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:40,704
Hey, down there!

654
01:05:42,841 --> 01:05:44,841
Could you give us a hand with this?

655
01:05:53,418 --> 01:05:56,044
TK-421, why aren’t you at your post?

656
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:58,721
TK-421, do you copy?

657
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:14,502
Take over. We’ve got a bad
transmitter. I’ll see what I can do.

658
01:06:31,522 --> 01:06:33,759
You know, between his howling
and your blasting everything in sight...

659
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:36,128
...it’s a wonder the whole station
doesn’t know we’re here.

660
01:06:36,228 --> 01:06:39,364
Bring ’em on! I’d prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin’ around.

661
01:06:39,464 --> 01:06:41,200
We’ve found the computer outlet, sir.

662
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:44,398
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire Imperial network.

663
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:59,351
He says he’s found the main controls to the
power beam that’s holding the ship here.

664
01:06:59,451 --> 01:07:02,046
He’ll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

665
01:07:12,262 --> 01:07:15,434
I don’t think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

666
01:07:15,534 --> 01:07:19,004
Whatever you say. I’ve done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

667
01:07:19,104 --> 01:07:20,372
I want to go with you.

668
01:07:20,472 --> 01:07:22,775
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

669
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,076
– But he can—
– They must be delivered safely...

670
01:07:25,176 --> 01:07:28,179
...or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

671
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:31,975
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

672
01:07:35,653 --> 01:07:38,987
The Force will be with you...
always.

673
01:07:48,329 --> 01:07:53,490
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

674
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,903
Ben is a great man.

675
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:59,007
– Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
– I didn’t hear you give any ideas.

676
01:07:59,107 --> 01:08:01,677
Well, anything’s better than just hangin’ around
waiting for ’em to pick us up.

677
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:03,677
Who do you think—

678
01:08:04,545 --> 01:08:07,716
– What is it?
– I’m afraid I’m not quite sure, sir.

679
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:10,585
He says “I’ve found her”
and keeps repeating “She’s here.”

680
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:13,421
Well, who... who has he found?

681
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:15,857
– Princess Leia.
– The princess? She’s here?!

682
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:17,788
– Princess?!
– Where? Where is she?

683
01:08:17,888 --> 01:08:19,888
Princess?!
What’s going on?

684
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:28,290
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

685
01:08:32,873 --> 01:08:35,743
I’m afraid she’s scheduled to be terminated.

686
01:08:35,843 --> 01:08:38,346
Oh, no! We’ve got to do something!

687
01:08:38,446 --> 01:08:40,982
– What are you talking about?
– The droids belong to her.

688
01:08:41,082 --> 01:08:43,085
She’s the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

689
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:45,987
Now look, don’t get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.

690
01:08:46,087 --> 01:08:49,458
But he didn’t know she was here.
Just find a way back into that detention block.

691
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,994
– I’m not going anywhere.
– They’re going to execute her.

692
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:54,396
Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn’t
want to just wait here to be captured.

693
01:08:54,496 --> 01:08:56,001
Now, all you want to do is stay?

694
01:08:56,101 --> 01:08:58,333
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

695
01:08:58,433 --> 01:09:01,962
– But they’re gonna kill her!
– Better her than me!

696
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:11,677
She’s rich.

697
01:09:13,815 --> 01:09:16,384
– Rich?
– Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

698
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:19,554
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

699
01:09:19,654 --> 01:09:22,590
– What?
– Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

700
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:25,691
– I don’t know, I can imagine quite a bit.
– You’ll get it.

701
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:27,991
– I better.
– You will.

702
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,598
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

703
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:32,499
– All right.
– What’s your plan?

704
01:09:32,599 --> 01:09:33,970
Uh...

705
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,570
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

706
01:09:37,939 --> 01:09:39,941
Okay...

707
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,271
Now... I’m gonna put these on you.

708
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:47,415
Okay Han, you... you put those on.

709
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:50,175
Don’t worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

710
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:52,754
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

711
01:09:52,854 --> 01:09:55,990
...but what should R2 and I do
if we’re discovered here?

712
01:09:56,090 --> 01:09:59,557
– Lock the door.
– And hope they don’t have blasters.

713
01:09:59,657 --> 01:10:01,657
That isn’t very reassuring.

714
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:26,016
<i>517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.</i>

715
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:32,458
<i>316, report to control.</i>

716
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:39,930
<i>53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.</i>

717
01:10:53,214 --> 01:10:55,814
I can’t see a thing in this helmet.

718
01:11:26,713 --> 01:11:29,317
– This is not gonna work.
– Why didn’t you say so before?

719
01:11:29,417 --> 01:11:31,708
I did say so before.

720
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:49,704
Where are you taking this... thing?

721
01:11:49,804 --> 01:11:52,604
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

722
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:57,804
I wasn’t notified.
I’ll have to clear it.

723
01:12:04,418 --> 01:12:06,587
– Look out! He’s loose!
– He’ll tear us all apart!

724
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:08,287
I’ll get him!

725
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:32,946
Look out!

726
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:45,059
We’ve got to find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

727
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:49,255
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.
I’ll hold them here.

728
01:12:52,866 --> 01:12:56,504
– Uh, everything’s under control. Situation normal.
– <i>What happened?</i>

729
01:12:56,604 --> 01:13:01,676
Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction,
but, uh, everything’s perfectly all right now.

730
01:13:01,776 --> 01:13:06,247
We’re fine... We’re all fine here now.
Thank you. How are you?

731
01:13:06,347 --> 01:13:07,849
<i>We’re sending a squad up.</i>

732
01:13:07,949 --> 01:13:11,979
Uh, negative, negative!
We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.

733
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:15,590
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

734
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:18,355
<i>Who is this? What’s your</i>
<i>operating number?</i>

735
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:19,955
Uh...

736
01:13:20,861 --> 01:13:25,030
Boring conversation anyway...
Luke! We’re gonna have company!

737
01:13:38,412 --> 01:13:40,715
Aren’t you a little short for a stormtrooper?

738
01:13:40,815 --> 01:13:43,608
Huh?
Oh, the uniform.

739
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:47,321
I’m Luke Skywalker.
I’m here to rescue you.

740
01:13:47,421 --> 01:13:49,022
– You’re who?
– I’m here to rescue you.

741
01:13:49,122 --> 01:13:51,025
I’ve got your R2 unit.
I’m here with Ben Kenobi.

742
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:53,682
– Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?
– Come on!

743
01:13:55,329 --> 01:13:59,367
– He is here.
– Obi-Wan Kenobi?

744
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:02,771
– What makes you think so?
– A tremor in the Force.

745
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:06,874
The last time I felt it was
in the presence of my old master.

746
01:14:06,974 --> 01:14:09,443
Surely he must be dead by now.

747
01:14:09,543 --> 01:14:12,413
Don’t underestimate the Force.

748
01:14:12,513 --> 01:14:16,751
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

749
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:20,288
You, my friend, are all that’s left
of their religion.

750
01:14:20,388 --> 01:14:21,847
Yes.

751
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:25,547
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

752
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:28,462
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

753
01:14:28,562 --> 01:14:32,166
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

754
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:34,836
If you’re right, he must not be
allowed to escape.

755
01:14:34,936 --> 01:14:38,766
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

756
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:49,781
Get behind me!
Get behind me!

757
01:15:01,028 --> 01:15:03,787
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

758
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,568
Can’t get out that way.

759
01:15:07,668 --> 01:15:09,369
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

760
01:15:09,469 --> 01:15:12,669
Maybe you’d like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

761
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,644
– C-3PO, C-3PO!
– <i>Yes, sir?</i>

762
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:20,244
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We’ve been cut off!

763
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,086
What was that?
I didn’t copy.

764
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:28,522
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

765
01:15:28,622 --> 01:15:30,723
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

766
01:15:30,823 --> 01:15:33,127
All other information
on your level is restricted.

767
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:35,627
Open up in there! Open up in there!

768
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,650
Oh, no!

769
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,900
There isn’t any other way out!

770
01:15:45,907 --> 01:15:47,976
I can’t hold them off forever!
Now what?!

771
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:51,813
This is some rescue! You came in here,
and you didn’t have a plan for getting out?

772
01:15:51,913 --> 01:15:55,442
– He’s the brains, sweetheart!
– Well, I didn’t...

773
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,653
– What the hell are you doing?
– Somebody has to save our skins.

774
01:16:02,457 --> 01:16:05,057
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

775
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:13,432
Get in there!

776
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:17,364
Get in there, you big furry oaf!
I don’t care what you smell.

777
01:16:17,938 --> 01:16:20,305
Get in there, and don’t worry about it.

778
01:16:22,943 --> 01:16:25,043
Wonderful girl!

779
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:29,745
Either I’m going to kill her,
or I’m beginning to like her.

780
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,752
Get in there!

781
01:16:45,399 --> 01:16:48,197
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

782
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:51,864
What an incredible smell
you’ve discovered!

783
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:56,277
Let’s get out of here.

784
01:16:56,377 --> 01:16:59,111
– Get away from there.
– No, wait!

785
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,955
Will you forget it? I already tried it!
It’s magnetically sealed.

786
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:10,524
Put that thing away!
You’re gonna get us all killed!

787
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:12,150
Absolutely, Your Worship.

788
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:15,096
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

789
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:17,632
You know, it’s not gonna take ’em long
to figure out what happened to us!

790
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:19,732
It could be worse.

791
01:17:24,071 --> 01:17:26,574
– It’s worse.
– There’s something alive in here.

792
01:17:26,674 --> 01:17:31,409
– That’s your imagination.
– Something just moved past my leg.

793
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,680
Look! Did you see that?

794
01:17:35,149 --> 01:17:36,749
What?

795
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:59,104
Kid! Luke!

796
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,510
Luke!

797
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:13,546
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

798
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:16,023
Blast it, will you?
My gun’s jammed.

799
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:19,182
– Where?
– Anywhere!

800
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,301
Luke, Luke!

801
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:54,128
Help him!
What happened?

802
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:58,161
I don’t know. It just let go of me
and disappeared.

803
01:19:04,138 --> 01:19:06,638
I’ve got a bad feeling about this.

804
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,600
– The walls are moving!
– Don’t just stand there!

805
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,900
Try and brace it with something.

806
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,992
Help me!

807
01:19:38,739 --> 01:19:40,539
Wait a minute!

808
01:19:42,676 --> 01:19:46,847
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!

809
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:50,414
<i>3PO!
Where could he be?</i>

810
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,080
Take over. See to him.

811
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,084
Look, there.

812
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,631
They’re madmen!

813
01:20:04,731 --> 01:20:07,334
They’re heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.

814
01:20:07,434 --> 01:20:09,234
Follow me.

815
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:14,640
You stand guard.

816
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:21,746
Come on.

817
01:20:24,451 --> 01:20:25,651
Oh!

818
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:32,060
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

819
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:35,227
If you don’t mind, I’d like to take him
down to maintenance.

820
01:20:35,327 --> 01:20:37,827
All right.

821
01:20:48,910 --> 01:20:51,979
3PO!
Come in, 3PO!

822
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:53,514
3PO!

823
01:20:53,614 --> 01:20:56,083
– Get on top!
– I can’t!

824
01:20:56,183 --> 01:21:01,480
Where could he be?! 3PO!
3PO, will you come in!

825
01:21:01,755 --> 01:21:04,124
They aren’t here. Something
must have happened to them.

826
01:21:04,224 --> 01:21:06,917
See if they’ve been captured.
Hurry!

827
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:13,499
One thing’s for sure.
We’re all gonna be a lot thinner.

828
01:21:16,036 --> 01:21:19,036
– Get on top of it.
– I’m trying.

829
01:21:24,211 --> 01:21:27,404
Thank goodness they haven’t found them!
Where could they be?

830
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,152
Use the comlink?

831
01:21:31,252 --> 01:21:34,316
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

832
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:39,427
Are you there, sir?

833
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:40,995
3PO?!

834
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:43,897
– We’ve had some problems.
– <i>Will you shut up and listen to me?!</i>

835
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:46,900
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level, will ya?!

836
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Do you copy!? Shut down all the garbage
mashers on the detention level!

837
01:21:51,972 --> 01:21:54,542
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

838
01:21:54,642 --> 01:21:57,142
No! Shut them all down.
Hurry!

839
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:11,681
What?

840
01:22:13,494 --> 01:22:16,095
Listen to them.
They’re dying, R2!

841
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:21,202
Curse my metal body! I wasn’t fast enough.
It’s all my fault! My poor master.

842
01:22:21,302 --> 01:22:26,003
We’re all right! You did great! Hey!
Open the pressure maintenance hatch...

843
01:22:26,103 --> 01:22:30,906
...on unit number... where are we?
3263827!

844
01:23:16,889 --> 01:23:20,728
If we can just avoid any more female advice,
we ought to be able to get outta here.

845
01:23:20,828 --> 01:23:23,931
Well, let’s get moving.

846
01:23:24,031 --> 01:23:25,765
Where are you going?

847
01:23:26,266 --> 01:23:28,634
No, wait! They’ll hear!

848
01:23:30,037 --> 01:23:32,538
Come here, you big coward.
Chewie, come here.

849
01:23:32,638 --> 01:23:34,039
Listen...

850
01:23:34,139 --> 01:23:37,003
...I don’t know who you are
or where you came from...

851
01:23:37,103 --> 01:23:40,046
...but from now on, you do
as I tell you, okay?

852
01:23:40,813 --> 01:23:43,751
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let’s get one thing straight.

853
01:23:43,851 --> 01:23:46,987
I take orders from just one person... me!

854
01:23:47,087 --> 01:23:49,123
It’s a wonder you’re still alive.

855
01:23:49,223 --> 01:23:52,393
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

856
01:23:52,493 --> 01:23:54,993
No reward is worth this!

857
01:24:04,805 --> 01:24:08,233
– Give me regular reports, please.
– Right.

858
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,310
– Do you know what’s going on?
– Maybe it’s another drill.

859
01:24:18,451 --> 01:24:20,354
You seen that new VT-16?

860
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:22,623
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

861
01:24:22,723 --> 01:24:24,625
They say it’s... it’s quite a thing to see.

862
01:24:24,725 --> 01:24:27,227
What was that?

863
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:29,985
Ah, it’s nothing. Outgassing.
Don’t worry about it.

864
01:24:35,335 --> 01:24:37,738
– There she is.
– C-3PO? Do you copy?

865
01:24:37,838 --> 01:24:39,239
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

866
01:24:39,339 --> 01:24:40,901
– Are you safe?
– <i>For the moment.</i>

867
01:24:41,001 --> 01:24:43,340
We’re in the main hangar
across from the ship.

868
01:24:45,312 --> 01:24:48,515
– We’re right above you. Stand by.
– You came in that thing?!

869
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:51,314
– You’re braver than I thought!
– Nice! Come on.

870
01:24:55,489 --> 01:24:57,184
It’s them!
Blast them!

871
01:24:58,525 --> 01:25:01,094
– Get back to the ship!
– Where are you going? Come back!

872
01:25:01,194 --> 01:25:04,095
– He certainly has courage.
– What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?

873
01:25:04,195 --> 01:25:05,695
Come on.

874
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:33,190
I think we took a wrong turn.

875
01:25:37,698 --> 01:25:39,398
There’s no lock!

876
01:25:42,869 --> 01:25:45,706
– That oughta hold them for a while.
– Quick! We’ve got to get across.

877
01:25:45,806 --> 01:25:49,076
– Find the controls that extend the bridge.
– I think I just blasted it.

878
01:25:49,176 --> 01:25:51,076
They’re coming through!

879
01:26:12,933 --> 01:26:14,833
Here, hold this.

880
01:26:31,218 --> 01:26:32,918
Here they come.

881
01:26:43,529 --> 01:26:45,229
For luck.

882
01:26:51,003 --> 01:26:56,003
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

883
01:27:10,023 --> 01:27:12,023
Where could they be?

884
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:27,002
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

885
01:27:45,559 --> 01:27:49,919
I’ve been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

886
01:27:50,996 --> 01:27:53,100
The circle is now complete.

887
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,671
When I left you, I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.

888
01:27:57,771 --> 01:28:00,471
Only a master of evil, Darth.

889
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:22,562
Your powers are weak, old man.

890
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:26,299
You can’t win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

891
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,800
...I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

892
01:28:36,976 --> 01:28:39,274
You should not have come back.

893
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:07,768
Didn’t we just leave this party?

894
01:29:09,242 --> 01:29:11,645
– What kept you?
– We, uh, ran into some old friends.

895
01:29:11,745 --> 01:29:14,247
– The ship all right?
– It seems okay, if we can get to it.

896
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:17,147
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

897
01:29:31,264 --> 01:29:32,764
Look!

898
01:29:35,602 --> 01:29:38,102
Come on, R2, we’re going.

899
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,039
Now’s our chance! Go!

900
01:29:44,277 --> 01:29:45,777
Ben?

901
01:30:00,394 --> 01:30:01,894
No!

902
01:30:10,504 --> 01:30:13,504
– Come on!
– Come on! Come on!

903
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:17,508
– Luke, it’s too late!
– Blast the door, kid!

904
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:29,320
<i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

905
01:30:32,058 --> 01:30:34,128
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

906
01:30:34,228 --> 01:30:37,356
...or this is gonna be a real short trip.
Okay, hit it!

907
01:31:08,394 --> 01:31:10,998
We’re coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off.

908
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:13,898
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

909
01:31:22,943 --> 01:31:25,043
I can’t believe he’s gone.

910
01:31:29,081 --> 01:31:30,981
There wasn’t anything
you could have done.

911
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,919
Come on, buddy.
We’re not out of this yet.

912
01:31:50,303 --> 01:31:53,063
You in, kid?
Okay, stay sharp.

913
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:05,417
Here they come.

914
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:24,600
They’re coming in too fast!

915
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:36,745
– We’ve lost the lateral controls!
– Don’t worry. She’ll hold together.

916
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:40,251
Hear me, baby?
Hold together.

917
01:33:01,975 --> 01:33:06,175
– Got him! I got him!
– Great, kid! Don’t get cocky.

918
01:33:07,414 --> 01:33:09,377
There’s still two more of them out there!

919
01:33:42,883 --> 01:33:46,583
– That’s it! We did it!
– We did it!

920
01:33:46,753 --> 01:33:49,613
Help! I think I’m melting!
This is all your fault!

921
01:33:57,130 --> 01:33:58,732
Are they away?

922
01:33:58,832 --> 01:34:01,902
They’ve just made the jump
into hyperspace.

923
01:34:02,002 --> 01:34:06,202
You’re sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

924
01:34:06,339 --> 01:34:10,939
I’m taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.

925
01:34:11,377 --> 01:34:13,680
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

926
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:17,217
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

927
01:34:17,317 --> 01:34:19,486
That doesn’t sound too hard.

928
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:23,400
They let us go. It’s the only explanation
for the ease of our escape.

929
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,159
– Easy? You call that easy?
– They’re tracking us.

930
01:34:26,259 --> 01:34:28,327
Not this ship, sister.

931
01:34:29,228 --> 01:34:31,831
At least the information in R2 is still intact.

932
01:34:31,931 --> 01:34:36,802
– What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
– The technical readouts of that battle station.

933
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:40,974
I only hope that when the data’s analyzed,
a weakness can be found.

934
01:34:41,074 --> 01:34:44,244
– It’s not over yet.
– It is for me, sister.

935
01:34:44,344 --> 01:34:47,715
Look, I ain’t in this for your revolution,
and I’m not in it for you, Princess.

936
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:50,750
I expect to be well paid.
I’m in it for the money.

937
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,753
You needn’t worry about your reward.

938
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:56,253
If money is all that you love,
then that’s what you’ll receive.

939
01:34:59,159 --> 01:35:03,230
Your friend is quite a mercenary.
I wonder if he really cares about anything...

940
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:05,365
...or anybody.

941
01:35:05,465 --> 01:35:07,065
I care!

942
01:35:13,473 --> 01:35:15,173
So...

943
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:19,610
– What do you think of her, Han?
– I’m trying not to, kid.

944
01:35:20,379 --> 01:35:21,979
Good.

945
01:35:25,084 --> 01:35:28,053
Still, she’s got a lot of spirit.

946
01:35:29,856 --> 01:35:32,893
I don’t know. What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me—

947
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:34,793
No.

948
01:36:21,341 --> 01:36:24,544
You’re safe. When we heard about Alderaan,
we feared the worst.

949
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:28,348
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.
You must use the information in this R2 unit...

950
01:36:28,448 --> 01:36:31,306
...to help plan the attack.
It’s our only hope.

951
01:36:52,839 --> 01:36:55,542
– Yes.
– <i>We’re approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

952
01:36:55,642 --> 01:37:00,571
<i>The rebel base is on a moon on the far side.
We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>

953
01:37:08,755 --> 01:37:12,926
The battle station is heavily shielded,
and carries a firepower...

954
01:37:13,026 --> 01:37:15,261
...greater than half the starfleet.

955
01:37:15,361 --> 01:37:19,699
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

956
01:37:19,799 --> 01:37:25,101
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

957
01:37:26,471 --> 01:37:30,210
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are
snub fighters going to be against that?

958
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:33,747
Well, the Empire doesn’t consider
a small, one-man fighter...

959
01:37:33,847 --> 01:37:37,347
...to be any threat,
or they’d have a tighter defense.

960
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:41,020
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

961
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,619
...has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

962
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:47,427
The approach will not be easy.

963
01:37:47,527 --> 01:37:50,697
You’re required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

964
01:37:50,797 --> 01:37:53,597
...and skim the surface to this point.

965
01:37:53,967 --> 01:37:56,970
The target area is only two meters wide.

966
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:01,874
It’s a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

967
01:38:01,974 --> 01:38:05,111
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

968
01:38:05,211 --> 01:38:10,216
A precise hit will start a chain reaction,
which should destroy the station.

969
01:38:10,316 --> 01:38:13,920
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

970
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:17,190
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you’ll have to use proton torpedoes.

971
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:20,359
– That’s impossible, even for a computer.
– It’s not impossible.

972
01:38:20,459 --> 01:38:22,996
I used to bull’s-eye womp rats
in my T-16 back home.

973
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:25,196
They’re not much bigger than two meters.

974
01:38:25,598 --> 01:38:29,334
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

975
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:39,834
<i>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.</i>

976
01:38:40,312 --> 01:38:44,283
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

977
01:38:44,383 --> 01:38:48,955
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

978
01:38:49,055 --> 01:38:53,555
...and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

979
01:38:57,230 --> 01:39:00,230
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

980
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:03,900
<i>All flight crews, man your stations.</i>

981
01:39:06,205 --> 01:39:09,108
So... you got your reward
and you’re just leaving, then?

982
01:39:09,208 --> 01:39:11,008
That’s right. Yeah.

983
01:39:12,177 --> 01:39:14,847
I’ve got some old debts
I’ve got to pay off with this stuff.

984
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:19,047
And even if I didn’t, you don’t think I’d be
fool enough to stick around here, do you?

985
01:39:19,418 --> 01:39:23,022
Why don’t you come with us? You’re
pretty good in a fight. We could use you.

986
01:39:23,122 --> 01:39:26,025
Come on. Why don’t you
take a look around?

987
01:39:26,125 --> 01:39:28,461
You know what’s about to happen,
what they’re up against.

988
01:39:28,561 --> 01:39:31,764
They could use a good pilot like you.
You’re turning your back on them.

989
01:39:31,864 --> 01:39:34,267
What good’s a reward
if you ain’t around to use it?

990
01:39:34,367 --> 01:39:37,137
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain’t my idea of courage.

991
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:40,267
It’s more like... suicide.

992
01:39:41,707 --> 01:39:44,611
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

993
01:39:44,711 --> 01:39:47,680
I guess that’s what you’re best at, isn’t it?

994
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:49,480
Hey, Luke.

995
01:39:52,218 --> 01:39:54,852
May the Force be with you.

996
01:40:01,094 --> 01:40:04,525
What are you looking at?
I know what I’m doing.

997
01:40:08,611 --> 01:40:13,611
<i>All pilots to your stations.
All pilots to your stations.</i>

998
01:40:19,688 --> 01:40:21,688
– What’s wrong?
– Oh, it’s Han.

999
01:40:22,089 --> 01:40:24,893
I don’t know. I really thought
he’d change his mind.

1000
01:40:24,994 --> 01:40:28,796
He’s got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1001
01:40:29,464 --> 01:40:31,964
I only wish Ben were here.

1002
01:40:40,009 --> 01:40:42,300
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1003
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,780
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1004
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:55,157
Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit
beat up. You want a new one?

1005
01:40:55,257 --> 01:40:58,194
Not on your life. That little droid and I
have been through a lot together.

1006
01:40:58,294 --> 01:41:00,194
You okay, R2?

1007
01:41:00,896 --> 01:41:02,396
Good.

1008
01:41:03,232 --> 01:41:06,232
<i>Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1009
01:41:06,636 --> 01:41:09,300
Hang on tight, R2.
You’ve got to come back.

1010
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:13,665
You wouldn’t want my life
to get boring, would you?

1011
01:42:02,291 --> 01:42:06,291
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1012
01:42:16,972 --> 01:42:19,972
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1013
01:42:20,509 --> 01:42:23,709
<i>Estimated time to firing range, 15 minutes.</i>

1014
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:38,928
– All wings report in.
– Red 10 standing by.

1015
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,164
– <i>Red Seven standing by.</i>
– Red Three standing by.

1016
01:42:41,264 --> 01:42:44,000
– Red Six standing by.
– Red Nine standing by.

1017
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:46,469
– Red Two standing by.
– <i>Red 11 standing by.</i>

1018
01:42:46,569 --> 01:42:48,469
Red Five standing by.

1019
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:52,305
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1020
01:42:55,678 --> 01:42:58,981
– <i>We’re passing through their magnetic field.</i>
– Hold tight.

1021
01:42:59,081 --> 01:43:02,746
<i>Switch your deflectors on.
Double front.</i>

1022
01:43:05,221 --> 01:43:08,022
– Look at the size of that thing!
– <i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.</i>

1023
01:43:08,122 --> 01:43:10,217
Accelerate to attack speed.

1024
01:43:12,995 --> 01:43:15,732
– This is it, boys.
– Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1025
01:43:15,832 --> 01:43:18,868
– I copy, Gold Leader.
– We’re starting for the target shaft now.

1026
01:43:18,968 --> 01:43:22,864
We’re in position. I’m going to cut across the axis
and try and draw their fire.

1027
01:43:36,886 --> 01:43:40,286
– <i>Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i>
– <i>I see it. Stay low.</i>

1028
01:43:47,596 --> 01:43:49,896
This is Red Five. I’m going in.

1029
01:43:53,702 --> 01:43:55,602
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1030
01:43:56,405 --> 01:43:59,137
– Are you all right?
– I got a little cooked, but I’m okay.

1031
01:44:04,713 --> 01:44:06,482
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1032
01:44:06,582 --> 01:44:08,584
...but they’re so small,
they’re evading our turbolasers.

1033
01:44:08,684 --> 01:44:12,784
We’ll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.

1034
01:44:15,191 --> 01:44:19,695
Watch yourself. There’s a lot of fire coming
from the right side of that deflection tower.

1035
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:22,532
– I’m on it.
– I’m going in. Cover me, Porkins.

1036
01:44:22,632 --> 01:44:24,932
I’m right with you, Red Three.

1037
01:44:30,206 --> 01:44:32,006
I’ve got a problem here.

1038
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:33,801
– Eject!
– I can hold it.

1039
01:44:33,901 --> 01:44:36,301
– Pull up!
– No, no, I’m all—

1040
01:44:40,216 --> 01:44:43,216
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1041
01:44:47,022 --> 01:44:50,222
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1042
01:44:57,733 --> 01:45:01,570
Squad leaders, we’ve
picked up a new group of signals.

1043
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,439
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1044
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:05,307
My scope’s negative.
I don’t see anything.

1045
01:45:05,407 --> 01:45:07,864
– Pick up your visual scanning.
– Here they come.

1046
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:12,800
Watch it. You’ve got one on your tail.

1047
01:45:17,653 --> 01:45:19,253
I’m hit!

1048
01:45:19,989 --> 01:45:23,088
– You’ve picked one up! Watch it!
– I can’t see it!

1049
01:45:24,627 --> 01:45:26,927
He’s on me tight.
I can’t shake him!

1050
01:45:28,163 --> 01:45:30,063
I’ll be right there.

1051
01:45:42,210 --> 01:45:46,103
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1052
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:51,553
<i>Pull in! Luke, pull in!</i>

1053
01:45:51,653 --> 01:45:55,453
Watch your back, Luke. Watch your back.
Fighters above you, coming in.

1054
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:03,732
I’m hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1055
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:06,032
Hang on back there.

1056
01:46:06,435 --> 01:46:08,704
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1057
01:46:08,804 --> 01:46:11,573
<i>There’s a heavy fire zone...
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1058
01:46:11,673 --> 01:46:13,373
I can’t shake him!

1059
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,669
I’m on him, Luke. Hold on.

1060
01:46:21,417 --> 01:46:23,544
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1061
01:46:30,559 --> 01:46:32,995
– Thanks, Wedge.
– <i>Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1062
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:36,556
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We’re starting our attack run.

1063
01:46:37,967 --> 01:46:40,767
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1064
01:46:42,871 --> 01:46:45,240
Stay in attack formation.

1065
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:48,441
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1066
01:46:53,883 --> 01:46:56,883
<i>Switch all power to front deflector screens.</i>

1067
01:46:56,986 --> 01:46:59,986
<i>Switch all power to front deflector screens.</i>

1068
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:06,896
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1069
01:47:06,996 --> 01:47:10,032
<i>Say about 20 guns. Some on the surface,
some on the towers.</i>

1070
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:13,132
<i>Death Star will be in range in five minutes.</i>

1071
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:17,370
Switch to targeting computer.

1072
01:47:20,676 --> 01:47:23,135
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1073
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:27,638
The guns!
They’ve stopped!

1074
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:31,501
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1075
01:47:31,601 --> 01:47:34,418
They’re coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1076
01:47:36,091 --> 01:47:39,591
– I’ll take them myself. Cover me.
– Yes, sir.

1077
01:47:53,776 --> 01:47:56,412
– It’s no good. I can’t maneuver.
– Stay on target.

1078
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,905
– We’re too close.
– Stay on target.

1079
01:48:00,382 --> 01:48:02,082
Loosen up!

1080
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:07,089
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1081
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,946
– I copy, Gold Leader.
– They came from behind.

1082
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,634
We’ve analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1083
01:48:18,734 --> 01:48:20,570
Should I have your ship standing by?

1084
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:26,070
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.

1085
01:48:26,608 --> 01:48:29,238
<i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>

1086
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:33,315
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1087
01:48:33,415 --> 01:48:37,086
– <i>This is Red Two flying toward you.</i>
– <i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1088
01:48:37,186 --> 01:48:38,887
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1089
01:48:38,987 --> 01:48:41,391
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1090
01:48:41,491 --> 01:48:44,160
<i>Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.</i>

1091
01:48:44,260 --> 01:48:47,560
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1092
01:48:56,404 --> 01:48:58,204
This is it!

1093
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,000
We should be able to see it by now.

1094
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:07,978
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1095
01:49:09,218 --> 01:49:11,754
There’s too much interference. Red Five,
can you see them from where you are?

1096
01:49:11,854 --> 01:49:15,278
– No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
– I see them.

1097
01:49:16,292 --> 01:49:18,092
I’m in range.

1098
01:49:18,661 --> 01:49:20,561
Target’s coming up.

1099
01:49:23,065 --> 01:49:25,400
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1100
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,032
Close up formation.

1101
01:49:29,371 --> 01:49:31,566
Almost there.

1102
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,901
– You’d better let her loose. They’re right behind me.
– Almost there.

1103
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,600
I can’t hold them.

1104
01:49:54,700 --> 01:49:56,400
It’s away!

1105
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:01,337
– <i>It’s a hit!</i>
– <i>Negative.</i>

1106
01:50:01,437 --> 01:50:03,906
Negative.
It didn’t go in.

1107
01:50:04,006 --> 01:50:06,968
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1108
01:50:12,748 --> 01:50:17,186
Red Leader, we’re right above you.
Turn to .05. We’ll cover for you.

1109
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:20,586
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1110
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:23,453
Get set up for your attack run.

1111
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:39,374
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1112
01:50:39,474 --> 01:50:43,045
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let’s close it up.
We’re going in full throttle.</i>

1113
01:50:43,145 --> 01:50:46,849
– That ought to keep those fighters off our back.
– Right with you, boss.

1114
01:50:46,949 --> 01:50:49,451
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1115
01:50:49,551 --> 01:50:51,876
It’ll be just like Beggar’s Canyon back home.

1116
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,830
We’ll stay back far enough to cover you.

1117
01:51:00,930 --> 01:51:03,599
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can’t see the exhaust port.</i>

1118
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:06,099
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1119
01:51:08,537 --> 01:51:12,139
– Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle.
– What about that tower?

1120
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:15,070
You worry about those fighters!
I’ll worry about the tower!

1121
01:51:20,949 --> 01:51:24,800
R2, that stabilizer’s broken loose again.
See if you can’t lock it down.

1122
01:51:33,862 --> 01:51:35,992
Fighters coming in .3.

1123
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:46,175
I’m hit!
I can’t stay with you!

1124
01:51:46,275 --> 01:51:48,510
Get clear, Wedge.
You can’t do any more good back there.

1125
01:51:48,610 --> 01:51:50,210
Sorry.

1126
01:51:50,779 --> 01:51:53,013
Let him go.
Stay on the leader.

1127
01:51:55,284 --> 01:51:58,284
Hurry, Luke. They’re coming in much faster
this time. We can’t hold them.

1128
01:52:01,800 --> 01:52:03,900
R2, try and increase the power.

1129
01:52:10,065 --> 01:52:12,865
<i>Hurry up, Luke!
Wait! Quick!</i>

1130
01:52:20,109 --> 01:52:23,000
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1131
01:52:23,145 --> 01:52:25,045
I’m on the leader.

1132
01:52:27,716 --> 01:52:29,415
Hang on, R2.

1133
01:52:44,899 --> 01:52:47,299
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1134
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,163
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1135
01:52:53,842 --> 01:52:56,178
The Force is strong with this one.

1136
01:52:56,278 --> 01:52:58,378
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1137
01:53:03,518 --> 01:53:04,919
<i>His computer’s off.</i>

1138
01:53:05,019 --> 01:53:07,590
<i>Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer! What’s wrong?</i>

1139
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:09,690
<i>Nothing. I’m all right.</i>

1140
01:53:23,438 --> 01:53:25,038
<i>I’ve lost R2!</i>

1141
01:53:26,141 --> 01:53:28,141
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1142
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:30,477
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1143
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:35,513
– <i>Rebel base in range.</i>
– You may fire when ready.

1144
01:53:36,051 --> 01:53:38,051
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1145
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:53,561
I have you now.

1146
01:53:55,300 --> 01:53:57,000
– What?
– Yahoo!

1147
01:53:59,241 --> 01:54:00,941
Look out!

1148
01:54:06,815 --> 01:54:10,148
You’re all clear, kid!
Now let’s blow this thing and go home!

1149
01:54:16,658 --> 01:54:18,258
<i>Stand by.</i>

1150
01:54:21,429 --> 01:54:23,029
<i>Stand by.</i>

1151
01:54:33,008 --> 01:54:35,408
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1152
01:54:36,311 --> 01:54:40,511
<i>Remember, the Force</i>
<i>will be with you always.</i>

1153
01:55:00,034 --> 01:55:01,534
Luke!

1154
01:55:04,873 --> 01:55:06,274
Hey! Hey!

1155
01:55:06,374 --> 01:55:08,043
I knew you’d come back.
I just knew it.

1156
01:55:08,143 --> 01:55:10,179
Well, I wasn’t going to let you get
all the credit and take all the reward.

1157
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:13,279
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1158
01:55:13,848 --> 01:55:17,448
– Oh, no!
– Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1159
01:55:17,886 --> 01:55:20,789
Say something.
You can repair him, can’t you?

1160
01:55:20,889 --> 01:55:24,259
– We’ll get to work on him right away.
– You must repair him.

1161
01:55:24,359 --> 01:55:27,361
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears will help,
I’ll gladly donate them.

1162
01:55:27,362 --> 01:55:29,462
He’ll be all right.

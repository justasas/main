1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,886
<i>Pursued by pirates!</i>

2
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,321
<i>While on a rite of passage,</i>

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,159
<i>six Jedi younglings
and Ahsoka Tano are ambushed.</i>

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,793
<i>Protecting the young Jedi,</i>

5
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:30,896
<i>Ahsoka was captured by
the nefarious Hondo Ohnaka</i>

6
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,466
<i>and taken to the planet Florrum.</i>

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,635
<i>Marshalling their courage and training,</i>

8
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,303
<i>the younglings infiltrated
the pirate stronghold</i>

9
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:40,606
<i>and rescued Ahsoka.</i>

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,676
<i>Now we find our heroes
in a race to their starship,</i>

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,445
<i>with the pirates closing in.</i>

12
00:01:00,263 --> 00:01:01,664
I know.
I see them.

13
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:02,698
They're gaining on us!

14
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,812
Uh, I think they're still
upset that we tricked them.

15
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:20,454
They'll get over it
once we're off their planet.

16
00:01:23,926 --> 00:01:25,460
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

17
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:26,494
Right.

18
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:28,998
Ganodi, we need a quick evac.

19
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:30,099
Come in, please.

20
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,467
Ganodi.

21
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,268
Maybe the pirates
are jamming the signal.

22
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:35,939
Where could she be?

23
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,941
Ganodi. Huyang.
Come in.

24
00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:45,281
Attaching your head took a lot longer

25
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:46,582
than I thought it would.

26
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:48,550
This is appreciated, youngling.

27
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:51,086
Mobility is paramount,
especially in an emergency.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,522
<i>Ganodi, where are you?</i>

29
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,533
I'm here.

30
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:56,359
I was in the back fixing Huyang.

31
00:01:56,393 --> 00:01:57,526
<i>Great.
That's great.</i>

32
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:58,861
But we're all gonna need repairs

33
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:00,462
if you don't have the engines running.

34
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:01,764
Where are you?

35
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:03,133
Ganodi, it's Ahsoka.

36
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:05,168
Padawan Tano!

37
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,436
We've rescued you.

38
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,704
Almost.

39
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:09,406
But we need you to get us home.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Are you ready?

41
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,943
Just tell me what I need to do.

42
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:15,147
Okay, fire up the engines
and head to these coordinates.

43
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:16,548
We'll be right there.

44
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,144
There they are!

45
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,780
R2, hold her steady
and lower the boarding ramp.

46
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,952
Come on!

47
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,274
Looks like our ride is here.

48
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:10,776
Everyone get topside and stay down.

49
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:14,882
But who's going to pilot the tank?

50
00:03:16,685 --> 00:03:18,453
Katooni, grab that mask.

51
00:03:21,123 --> 00:03:22,824
Uh, that'll have to do.

52
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,349
The steering must have come loose.

53
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,327
We got him!

54
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,663
Hang on!

55
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,738
Oh, no.

56
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:06,675
No, no, no!

57
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,227
They're coming back!

58
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,852
R2, get out of there now!

59
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,527
Everyone, let go!

60
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,795
Jump down now.

61
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,419
Nice try, little Jedi.

62
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:20,188
But it looks like you're coming with us.

63
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:39,517
What the...

64
00:05:39,551 --> 00:05:40,752
Droids?

65
00:05:43,222 --> 00:05:44,923
It's an invasion.

66
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,250
Boss! Boss!

67
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,351
We're all in trouble!

68
00:06:09,386 --> 00:06:10,386
Gah!

69
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,830
Hondo.

70
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:23,934
General Grievous, I presume?

71
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,769
What a surprise.

72
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:26,836
Have a seat.

73
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,406
What, may I ask, is the honor?

74
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:34,111
You can dispense with
the pleasantries, pirate.

75
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,714
This planet is now under
Separatist control.

76
00:06:37,749 --> 00:06:39,850
Uh-huh.

77
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,119
And what do you suppose that means?

78
00:06:42,154 --> 00:06:46,123
It means you have
a new master, pirate scum.

79
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:56,134
<i>Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again.</i>

80
00:06:56,168 --> 00:06:59,037
<i>As I recall the last time
we met face-to-face,</i>

81
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,273
<i>I was your prisoner.</i>

82
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,340
Uh...

83
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,209
<i>And you attempted to barter me off</i>

84
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:04,744
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

85
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:05,912
But can you blame me?

86
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,181
I mean, a Sith Lord.

87
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,851
What a handsome price
you would...

88
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,186
<i>- Silence!</i>

89
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,189
<i>You are going to pay the price
for your treachery.</i>

90
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,858
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

91
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:16,892
Name the price.

92
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:17,894
I'm sure we can reach...

93
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:20,263
<i>- There will be payment,
but no deals...</i>

94
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,831
<i>only demands.</i>

95
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,734
<i>Your entire arsenal will be melted down.</i>

96
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:28,238
<i>Everything you own is now property</i>

97
00:07:28,272 --> 00:07:30,173
<i>of the Separatist Alliance.</i>

98
00:07:30,207 --> 00:07:31,774
Now you go too far!

99
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:33,376
Unacceptable!

100
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,111
This is an outrage.

101
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,246
This...

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
Hold on.

103
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:38,815
We can make a deal.

104
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,919
This is not good business!

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,255
This isn't good.

106
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,059
Those scrappin' droids
are looting the place.

107
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,160
They're dismantling our ships.

108
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,963
The fact that Grievous is here
with his entire fleet

109
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:54,633
means that Master Kenobi
must have been overrun.

110
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:58,136
This entire system is now
in Separatist controlled space.

111
00:07:58,171 --> 00:07:59,638
What should we do?

112
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:00,839
There's nowhere to run.

113
00:08:00,874 --> 00:08:03,543
You're not running anywhere, skug.

114
00:08:03,577 --> 00:08:05,512
You're still my prisoner.

115
00:08:05,546 --> 00:08:08,181
Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists

116
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,217
in exchange for my freedom.

117
00:08:10,251 --> 00:08:11,986
Not likely.

118
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:14,256
Grievous didn't come here to make deals.

119
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,059
He already controls the planet
and the system.

120
00:08:17,093 --> 00:08:18,561
If you hand us over to him,

121
00:08:18,595 --> 00:08:20,698
he'll kill us and then you.

122
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,767
We have a common enemy in Grievous.

123
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:25,003
Together, we can get out of this.

124
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,105
You must have
some other ships somewhere.

125
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,407
You are pirates.

126
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,710
Hondo's got a private fleet,

127
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,380
but only he knows where the ships are.

128
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:35,649
Then we'll have to rescue him.

129
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,416
I know Grievous.

130
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:38,886
And I know droids.

131
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,589
With my help, you stand a better chance.

132
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:52,968
You got yourself a deal, Jedi.

133
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,090
Halt.

134
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,962
You captured this tank?

135
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:16,997
Not bad for an astromech.

136
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,467
What's your ID number?

137
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,942
Hey, do not get smart with me.

138
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,977
I outrank you.

139
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:35,651
You just watch yourself.

140
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:38,620
I could have you melted down
with the rest of this junk.

141
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:40,822
That's right.

142
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:43,260
Now take it over to Hangar 12.

143
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:46,396
And no detours.

144
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,198
We'll be watching you.

145
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:11,457
Jedi.

146
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,627
And here I thought
you made your escape, no?

147
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:15,995
No.

148
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,998
There were complications.

149
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,067
Now, we have to put
our differences aside

150
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,301
and be friends,

151
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:23,270
or else we're all gonna die here.

152
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:26,139
Ah, very diplomatic.

153
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:27,308
Ha!

154
00:10:27,342 --> 00:10:30,278
I knew you did not come back
to rescue Hondo,

155
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:31,412
how do you say it?

156
00:10:31,447 --> 00:10:33,715
Out of the goodness of your hearts.

157
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,350
No, no, no, no.

158
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,187
You need something from me.

159
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,156
A ship, to be specific.

160
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,424
Ah, yes.

161
00:10:41,492 --> 00:10:42,759
A ship, a ship.

162
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:46,497
Ah, but where would we find
one of those?

163
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:50,201
My new friend General Grievous
has destroyed my ships.

164
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,569
We know you have one,

165
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:52,971
a whole pirate fleet.

166
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,409
And one of my old friends, apparently,

167
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:58,511
has been talking too much.

168
00:10:59,981 --> 00:11:02,215
Ah, what does it matter?

169
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,751
We'll never reach the vault anyway.

170
00:11:03,786 --> 00:11:06,287
Grievous' army is way too big.

171
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:07,321
Don't give up.

172
00:11:07,322 --> 00:11:08,523
We can fight.

173
00:11:08,557 --> 00:11:09,957
If I may, sir.

174
00:11:09,992 --> 00:11:13,695
I have instructed younglings
for over 1,000 generations,

175
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,498
and these are among the best
I have ever seen.

176
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:20,068
Well, then, show me.

177
00:11:20,103 --> 00:11:22,806
Show me your swords, tiny Jedi.

178
00:11:22,873 --> 00:11:26,243
Show Hondo you are ready to fight.

179
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,246
Ah.

180
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:30,515
And you, child.

181
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,384
Where is your saber?

182
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:34,086
It's not finished.

183
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,388
I never finished it.

184
00:11:35,422 --> 00:11:36,956
I've done everything right,

185
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,290
but it won't work.

186
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,525
You must trust

187
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,928
that the components
that form your lightsaber

188
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,963
are meant to be together.

189
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,564
There is no other way.

190
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:48,201
It is the Force that binds them.

191
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:49,770
Yes, I was just going to say that.

192
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:50,804
Finish it now.

193
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:51,972
Finish, finish!

194
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:54,942
This is worth the price of a ship.

195
00:11:54,976 --> 00:11:57,979
To see the construction
of a Jedi lightsaber,

196
00:11:58,014 --> 00:12:00,882
this... this is priceless.

197
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,017
Finish it,

198
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,186
and together, we can defeat Grievous.

199
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:14,129
Oh.

200
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,398
Amazing.

201
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:21,537
That is truly amazing.

202
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,947
Well, cut me down, little Jedi.

203
00:12:31,981 --> 00:12:33,216
It's time to leave.

204
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,594
So why the big show?

205
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,563
You didn't really have a choice.

206
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,431
You know we have to work together.

207
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,300
Because, Jedi,

208
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:53,939
you know what we are about to
attempt is very dangerous.

209
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,874
And I may be a pirate,

210
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:59,879
but I do not like
taking children into battle.

211
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:02,382
That didn't seem to bother you
when you attacked us.

212
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:06,219
Well, today is a new day,

213
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,321
and lucky for you, today,

214
00:13:08,355 --> 00:13:09,823
I like children.

215
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:11,658
Now, let's free the rest of my men.

216
00:13:34,634 --> 00:13:36,536
<i>This is OOM-87, General.</i>

217
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,672
<i>The prison area is under attack.</i>

218
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:41,241
<i>There are several miniature Jedi here.</i>

219
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,542
What?

220
00:13:42,576 --> 00:13:44,477
You aren't making any sense.

221
00:13:44,512 --> 00:13:45,680
What Jedi?

222
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:46,848
<i>The little ones,</i>

223
00:13:46,882 --> 00:13:48,549
<i>half the size of normal Jedi.</i>

224
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:50,018
<i>They're freeing the prisoners
and...</i>

225
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:51,119
<i>my knees!</i>

226
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,458
Prepare to open fire.

227
00:13:56,492 --> 00:13:59,261
We will bring the building down
on their heads.

228
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:49,918
I got your back.

229
00:14:49,953 --> 00:14:51,186
Great.

230
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,421
I feel so safe.

231
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:11,876
They run.

232
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,910
Quickly.

233
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:13,911
After them.

234
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,527
They went the wrong way.

235
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,163
Don't worry.

236
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,090
What about the others?

237
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,826
We can't just leave them.

238
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,296
You are welcome to come, small one.

239
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,331
You may join our merry band of pirates.

240
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,266
I won't just run away.

241
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,370
Ahsoka trusted you.

242
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:37,738
We all trusted you.

243
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:51,787
R2, do something.

244
00:16:52,855 --> 00:16:53,855
I don't know.

245
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,391
We have to shake Grievous off.

246
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:57,227
Get aggressive.
Ah!

247
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,580
Too aggressive.

248
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,349
Far too aggressive.

249
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:27,162
Yes, well, it was an effective strategy,

250
00:17:27,196 --> 00:17:29,231
but not what I would recommend.

251
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:57,497
So many lightsabers
to add to my collection.

252
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,344
Hurry!

253
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:11,378
Come on!

254
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,779
Run.

255
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:14,481
All of you run!

256
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,920
Ha!

257
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:08,908
Ahsoka!

258
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,910
Come on!

259
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:11,311
Ahsoka, come on!

260
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:20,454
You will never defeat Grievous.

261
00:19:20,488 --> 00:19:22,156
Never!

262
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:25,958
I wouldn't be so sure.

263
00:19:30,198 --> 00:19:31,264
Did we get him?

264
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:32,298
I can't tell.

265
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,008
Show is over, kiddies.

266
00:19:40,042 --> 00:19:41,276
Let's get out of here.

267
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:09,976
And let me see.

268
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,611
Oh, the cost of the fuel.

269
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:13,848
I had to use a lot of fuel.

270
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,351
The general wear and tear
on my men and equipment.

271
00:20:17,386 --> 00:20:20,354
A couple of them died, I think.

272
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:21,790
Believe me, Kenobi.

273
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:26,662
Staging a rescue is not
an inexpensive proposition.

274
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,765
So you mean to tell me
you were staging a rescue,

275
00:20:29,834 --> 00:20:33,003
not attempting to hijack
a Jedi starship?

276
00:20:33,037 --> 00:20:34,538
You're welcome!

277
00:20:34,572 --> 00:20:36,673
Oh, the thanklessness!

278
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,141
What an accusation.

279
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:39,176
I am gone!

280
00:20:39,178 --> 00:20:40,912
I will send you my bill!

281
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,602
Ahsoka.

282
00:21:03,636 --> 00:21:05,070
It's good to see you're all safe.

283
00:21:05,105 --> 00:21:06,573
Yes, Master.

284
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:08,842
We had quite an eventful mission.

285
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,778
The most eventful since the time

286
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:14,481
Master Yoda went to find
his lightsaber crystal.

287
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:15,515
What?

288
00:21:15,517 --> 00:21:16,517
Oh!

289
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:17,952
- Tell us!
- What happened then?

290
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,555
I'm afraid that story will have to wait.

291
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:23,157
For now, be proud.

292
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:25,694
You have survived an ordeal
few your age could.

293
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,032
Welcome home, young Jedi.

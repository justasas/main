1
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:23,841
<i>Neutral star systems in peril.</i>

2
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:27,611
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress
command the planet Mandalore</i>

3
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,814
<i>through the puppet Prime Minister Almec</i>

4
00:00:29,882 --> 00:00:32,816
<i>while they expand
their criminal enterprise.</i>

5
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,252
<i>With the Death Watch removed from power</i>

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,721
<i>and the Jedi unaware
of the villainous plot,</i>

7
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,457
<i>nothing stands in the way
of Darth Maul's vision</i>

8
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,792
<i>for a vast criminal empire.</i>

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,262
<i>We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned</i>

10
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,263
<i>as her few remaining loyal subjects</i>

11
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:50,300
<i>make a desperate attempt to rescue her.</i>

12
00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,001
What do you want, you traitor?

13
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:56,172
We'll never betray you, Auntie Satine.

14
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,340
I'm here to rescue you.

15
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:59,108
Korkie.

16
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:01,844
Freeze!

17
00:01:01,912 --> 00:01:03,946
Hold it there.

18
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,617
Death Watch.

19
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:12,422
Bo.

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,557
It's been a long time.

21
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:15,691
It's okay, Auntie.

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,493
She's on our side now.

23
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,795
Why are you helping now?

24
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:23,733
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,536
There was a time
when we weren't enemies.

26
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:30,006
Perhaps that time has come again.

27
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,308
Come on.

28
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:32,476
Let's go.

29
00:01:38,716 --> 00:01:41,318
It's all clear.
Come on.

30
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:47,124
We need to contact the Jedi Council.

31
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:48,926
Korkie, give me your comlink.

32
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:51,195
It won't be any good
unless we get outside the city.

33
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:52,964
All of the frequencies are jammed.

34
00:01:53,031 --> 00:01:56,233
You are all taking
a terrible risk by helping me.

35
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:58,002
Nothing we haven't done before.

36
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,170
Right, Auntie?

37
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,905
Let's get going.

38
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:35,677
Take 'em out.

39
00:02:43,753 --> 00:02:45,654
Get the duchess clear.

40
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,596
The transmission is still blocked.

41
00:03:32,474 --> 00:03:33,574
You're clear.

42
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,944
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

43
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:38,412
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,714
<i>My people have been massacred.</i>

45
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:46,021
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

46
00:03:55,098 --> 00:03:56,766
<i>You summoned me, Masters?</i>

47
00:04:01,938 --> 00:04:04,006
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

48
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:05,541
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

49
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:07,142
<i>My people have been massacred,</i>

50
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,845
<i>and Almec is now the prime minister.</i>

51
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,413
<i>I can't explain everything now</i>

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,383
<i>but Almec has the support
of the crime families.</i>

53
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:18,719
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

54
00:04:21,456 --> 00:04:24,459
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi.

55
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:28,229
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years.

56
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:31,466
And according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

57
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:34,136
they're no longer in league
with the Separatists.

58
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,971
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

59
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:37,973
it was most likely an independent act

60
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,409
caused by the Death Watch alone.

61
00:04:40,477 --> 00:04:42,811
Without involvement
from the Separatists,

62
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,915
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

63
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:47,750
I'm afraid we cannot help.

64
00:04:47,818 --> 00:04:50,720
We cannot just hand Mandalore
over to these crime families

65
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:52,389
and let Satine become a martyr.

66
00:04:52,456 --> 00:04:55,025
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

67
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,827
makes this situation difficult.

68
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:00,997
Understand your feelings I do,
Obi-Wan.

69
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:02,499
But to take action,

70
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:05,936
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

71
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:08,371
You know what the Senate will decide.

72
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,508
They will not send aid
to a neutral system.

73
00:05:11,576 --> 00:05:15,879
At this time, nothing more can we do.

74
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:22,152
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

75
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,821
including the renegade
Death Watch soldiers.

76
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:26,456
But we will find them.

77
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:28,859
The duchess appears
to have contacted the Jedi

78
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:30,293
just as anticipated.

79
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,662
Good.

80
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,764
You have done well.

81
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:35,799
What of the people?

82
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,335
You are the legitimate prime minister.

83
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:40,004
Mandalore is a sovereign planet

84
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,308
and you will maintain its neutrality.

85
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,676
And what of the Jedi?

86
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,880
Because of Mandalore's neutrality,

87
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,482
the Jedi have no jurisdiction here.

88
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,153
If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend,

89
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:59,590
he will have to come alone.

90
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:28,418
Ah.

91
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,886
Ah!

92
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:33,323
Anakin, that's the last time
I borrow a ship from you.

93
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:46,770
You better get your ship looked at.

94
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:48,838
Oh, it's my friend's ship.

95
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:52,329
He told me it was perfectly fine.

96
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:54,677
Terribly sorry about that.

97
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,678
Do you have a landing permit?

98
00:06:56,746 --> 00:06:59,348
Um, I think I left it in the ship.

99
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,350
Come with me, and I'll get it.

100
00:07:51,052 --> 00:07:53,519
Here to do more
of your master's bidding?

101
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,189
I do my own bidding.

102
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:57,823
Obi-Wan.

103
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,596
Are you alone?

104
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:04,664
Yes.

105
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:06,172
The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate

106
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,434
will be of no help to us here.

107
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,374
I trust you have an escape plan then?

108
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:17,176
As always, my dear.

109
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:28,487
There's no record
of a prisoner transfer here.

110
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:30,789
The orders came from upstairs.

111
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:36,395
What's the authorization code?

112
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:38,297
Oh, um...

113
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:46,548
Hey, you!

114
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:47,572
Stop!

115
00:08:49,642 --> 00:08:50,642
It's the duchess.

116
00:08:50,676 --> 00:08:52,077
She's getting away.

117
00:09:29,249 --> 00:09:31,117
We have to contact my sister for help.

118
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:32,819
She'll send reinforcements.

119
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,354
Who's your sister?

120
00:09:47,903 --> 00:09:49,304
Brace yourself!

121
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,647
Let's get out of here.

122
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:02,352
Obi-Wan!

123
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:31,482
No.
It can't be.

124
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:41,593
We meet again, Kenobi.

125
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,662
Welcome to my world.

126
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:49,667
Take them back to the palace.

127
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:07,220
Your noble flaw is a weakness
shared by you...

128
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,122
and your duchess.

129
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,192
You should have chosen the dark side,

130
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:13,726
Master Jedi.

131
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,798
Your emotions betray you.

132
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,833
Your fear,

133
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:24,036
and yes, your anger.

134
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:28,173
Let your anger deepen your hatred.

135
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:30,075
Don't listen to him, Obi...

136
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:31,610
Quiet.

137
00:11:31,678 --> 00:11:35,747
You can kill me,
but you will never destroy me.

138
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,250
It takes strength
to resist the dark side.

139
00:11:38,317 --> 00:11:40,351
Only the weak embrace it.

140
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:42,520
It is more powerful than you know.

141
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,722
And those who oppose it
are more powerful

142
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,957
than you'll ever be.

143
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,660
I know where you're from.

144
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,562
I've been to your village.

145
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:54,199
I know the decision to join
the dark side wasn't yours.

146
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,901
The Nightsisters made it for you.

147
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:56,968
Silence!

148
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,171
You think you know me?

149
00:11:59,238 --> 00:12:01,773
It was I who languished for years

150
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:03,809
thinking of nothing but you.

151
00:12:03,876 --> 00:12:05,744
Nothing but this moment.

152
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,284
And now the perfect tool
for my vengeance

153
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,319
is in front of us.

154
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,455
I never planned on killing you.

155
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:19,859
But I will make you share
my pain, Kenobi.

156
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:33,739
Satine.

157
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:48,588
Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...

158
00:12:52,393 --> 00:12:54,628
I've loved you always.

159
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:58,665
I always will.

160
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:12,912
Do we kill him now, brother?

161
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,581
No.

162
00:13:14,648 --> 00:13:15,982
Imprison him below.

163
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,786
Let him drown in his misery.

164
00:13:19,853 --> 00:13:22,422
Take him to his cell to rot.

165
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,045
You summoned me, Chancellor?

166
00:13:46,113 --> 00:13:48,247
Prepare my ship.

167
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:13,907
- Ah!
- It's the rebels!

168
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:37,730
Sorry, I don't believe we've met.

169
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:38,798
You are?

170
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:39,899
Bo-Katan.

171
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:41,067
I'm here to rescue you.

172
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,602
That's all you need to know.

173
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,704
Sounds good to me.

174
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,973
You ever used one of these before?

175
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,310
No, but in this case,
I'm a fast learner.

176
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:51,377
Let's go.

177
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:37,433
Halt!

178
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,334
Maul must really want you dead.

179
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,637
You have no idea.

180
00:16:50,244 --> 00:16:53,280
Hmm, I sense a presence.

181
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:56,449
A presence
I haven't felt since...

182
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:58,318
Master.

183
00:17:11,999 --> 00:17:13,900
Master.

184
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:20,206
I am most impressed to see
you have survived your injuries.

185
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,675
I used your training, Master.

186
00:17:22,743 --> 00:17:24,977
And I have built all this

187
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:28,247
in hopes of returning to your side.

188
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,982
Hmm.

189
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,051
How unfortunate

190
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:36,055
that are attempting to deceive me.

191
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,857
Master?

192
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:43,030
You have become a rival!

193
00:18:43,795 --> 00:18:46,330
Go back to your Republic
and tell them what has happened.

194
00:18:46,398 --> 00:18:48,532
That would likely lead
to a Republic invasion

195
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
of Mandalore.

196
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,469
Yes, and Maul will die.

197
00:18:51,536 --> 00:18:53,504
But Mandalore will survive.

198
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:55,739
We always survive.

199
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,509
Now go.

200
00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,911
Your Satine's sister, aren't you?

201
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:05,116
I'm so sorry.

202
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,836
Oof.

203
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,220
Ugh!

204
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,590
Uh!

205
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,216
Brother.

206
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:30,001
Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice.

207
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:33,038
I'm not like you.

208
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:35,774
I never was.

209
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,914
Remember, the first
and only reality of the Sith:

210
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:45,383
there can only be two.

211
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:50,222
And you are no longer my apprentice.

212
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:54,493
You have been replaced.

213
00:21:28,864 --> 00:21:29,864
Ugh!

214
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,571
Have mercy.

215
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,006
Please.

216
00:21:38,074 --> 00:21:39,174
Please!

217
00:21:39,241 --> 00:21:40,909
There is no mercy.

218
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,282
Do not worry.

219
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,951
I'm not going to kill you.

220
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,588
I have other uses for you.

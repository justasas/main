1
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:21,213
<i>War in the Inner Rim!</i>

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,815
<i>Rebel leader Steela Gerrera
has joined forces</i>

3
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:26,484
<i>with General Tandin
after boldly rescuing</i>

4
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:28,986
<i>Onderon's former king from execution,</i>

5
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:32,022
<i>evading a trap set
by Separatist ally King Rash</i>

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,091
<i>and the droid general Kalani.</i>

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,893
<i>Amid growing public support
and rising unrest,</i>

8
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:39,562
<i>Ahsoka continues to monitor
the rebels' efforts</i>

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,731
<i>as they rally around Ramsis Dendup</i>

10
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,602
<i>to restore his reign
as the rightful king</i>

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,104
<i>and finally put an end</i>

12
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,506
<i>to the Separatist occupation
of Onderon.</i>

13
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,291
I'm picking up
an electromagnetic field.

14
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:09,594
Roger, roger.
It's coming from there.

15
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:17,369
Whoa!

16
00:01:17,437 --> 00:01:22,074
<i>My fellow subjects,
I appear not as your king</i>

17
00:01:22,142 --> 00:01:24,877
<i>but as a servant of Onderon.</i>

18
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:27,913
<i>We are in the midst
of a great struggle.</i>

19
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:30,784
<i>The Confederacy has used
the recent attacks</i>

20
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:35,822
<i>as an opportunity to tighten
their hold on Onderon.</i>

21
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,560
<i>They have accused me of leading
these so-called terrorists.</i>

22
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:43,396
<i>It is a lie they have engineered</i>

23
00:01:43,464 --> 00:01:46,133
<i>to further restrict your independence</i>

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,804
<i>and use deadly force
against our people.</i>

25
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,608
<i>The truth is, I have never
met them before now.</i>

26
00:01:53,676 --> 00:01:58,013
<i>I have come to know them
as the true sons of Onderon.</i>

27
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,149
<i>They are unwilling
to surrender our freedom</i>

28
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:04,753
<i>to those who conspire
to take it from us.</i>

29
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:09,525
<i>Our destiny is tied to them
and this planet.</i>

30
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:13,095
<i>We must all rise together
to protect it.</i>

31
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:19,569
Uh-oh.

32
00:02:19,636 --> 00:02:23,005
Why are they looking at us that way?

33
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:26,276
Hey!

34
00:02:26,343 --> 00:02:28,177
What the?
Blast them!

35
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:34,617
Ahh!

36
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:35,985
Uh-oh.

37
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:58,542
The people are
turning against the droids.

38
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,210
There's rioting in the streets now.

39
00:03:00,278 --> 00:03:02,546
That's a beautiful thing.

40
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:06,284
We need to keep the battle
to the outskirts of the city.

41
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,520
Less structures and people.

42
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,924
But less clankers.
Their main force is in Iziz.

43
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:13,492
We should join the fight down there

44
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:15,427
and take it straight to King Rash.

45
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,465
We all want victory, but not
at the cost of innocent lives.

46
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,234
If we fight door to door,
no one is safe.

47
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,569
This is war, Steela.

48
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,837
She's right.

49
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,305
I agree.

50
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,741
The more you draw the droids
from the city to the highlands,

51
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,977
the safer the people will be.

52
00:03:32,044 --> 00:03:34,312
My men await your command, my Lord.

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,183
I believe there is a new contender.

54
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,754
<i>You will lead our forces,
including the Royal Army.</i>

55
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:46,058
Steela is now the commanding general.

56
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,161
A great choice.

57
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:51,364
As you wish, my Lord.

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,367
You and your rebels
renewed my faith in myself.

59
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,671
Now I'm putting my faith in you.

60
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,807
Thank you, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,843
Let's ride.

62
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,761
Just in case.

63
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:50,327
We are losing the public.

64
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:54,097
If they turn against us,
I fear the outcome.

65
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:56,933
Fear will bring them back.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,335
We must eliminate Dendup,
General Tandin,

67
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:00,570
and the terrorists

68
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:03,206
before the people
commit to their efforts.

69
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:05,308
General Tandin is weak.

70
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:09,279
His army will not withstand
the power of the Confederacy.

71
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:11,915
Neither will the terrorists.

72
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:15,518
General, our scouts have
located the main rebel forces

73
00:05:15,585 --> 00:05:18,287
in the mountains to the east.

74
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,656
With the rioting in the city,
how can we spare the troops

75
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,692
to attack the rebels in the mountains?

76
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,829
Do not underestimate our means.

77
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:27,631
If the rebel army falls,

78
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:30,868
the citizens will lose their courage,

79
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:33,236
and order will be restored.

80
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:45,115
Your target lies
in the mountains to the east.

81
00:05:45,183 --> 00:05:46,717
The army will follow.

82
00:05:46,785 --> 00:05:49,753
Leave no survivors.
Go.

83
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,289
By your command.

84
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,210
The droid army is almost here.

85
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:12,287
Everyone, get ready.

86
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,303
Ready.

87
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:30,873
Saw, begin your attack.

88
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:46,988
Yah!

89
00:07:30,267 --> 00:07:32,201
Ahh!

90
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:33,269
No!

91
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:34,837
Where did that come from?

92
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:36,905
There.

93
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,976
Any ideas?

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,544
Yeah.
Run!

95
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:13,443
Ahh!

96
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:35,132
<i>I take it the rebels
have Dooku's full attention.</i>

97
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,667
It's a full-scale war.

98
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,069
They need our help.

99
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,804
Please talk to the Council.

100
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:42,740
<i>Even Master Windu
would be wary at this point.</i>

101
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:45,510
<i>The Council will not
engage or involve the Republic</i>

102
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:47,111
<i>in an internal affair.</i>

103
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,712
The Separatists have a new gunship

104
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,214
with a powerful ray shield.

105
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,982
Nothing's getting past it.

106
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:53,550
<i>I am sorry, Ahsoka.</i>

107
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:55,485
<i>They will have to find a way.</i>

108
00:08:55,553 --> 00:08:58,388
<i>Do not stay there
if their failure is certain.</i>

109
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,924
<i>Evacuate who you can and return
to Coruscant immediately.</i>

110
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,225
<i>Do you understand?</i>

111
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,128
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

112
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,763
We need to help them.

113
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,100
We will do what we can
to relocate the survivors.

114
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:13,035
Before they lose their planet.

115
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:14,970
We can't.

116
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:16,372
What difference does it make now?

117
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:19,008
The Separatists know we're involved.

118
00:09:19,075 --> 00:09:21,245
I don't disagree with you, Anakin,

119
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:25,116
but to send in Republic gunships
defeats our purpose.

120
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:27,819
We must stay true to our intentions,

121
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:29,787
learn our lessons.

122
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,857
It doesn't have to look like
we're the ones helping.

123
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:35,226
What if another party was involved?

124
00:09:35,294 --> 00:09:37,662
Another party?

125
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,431
Who in the galaxy
would be running around

126
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:41,466
with an extra batch of missiles?

127
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:45,937
Hondo.

128
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,283
Is the Republic going to help us?

129
00:09:57,351 --> 00:09:58,919
No.

130
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:01,088
What's it going to take?

131
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,823
King Rash rules Onderon.

132
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:06,227
Unless that changes,
the Republic can't do anything.

133
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:08,296
They're pulling back.
Cover them.

134
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,211
At this rate, the clankers

135
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,746
aren't going to need reinforcements.

136
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,815
We have to regroup at the nest.

137
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,249
Yah!

138
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:01,449
Skywalker, my old friend.

139
00:11:01,517 --> 00:11:03,250
You come alone?

140
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:04,652
For your service.

141
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,820
Oh, business!

142
00:11:06,888 --> 00:11:10,391
Good, good, good.
That I understand.

143
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:12,893
I need you to make a delivery for me.

144
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:17,131
And that all I am to you, Jedi?

145
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:19,133
A delivery boy?

146
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:22,003
I know that if I need arms
shipped illegally,

147
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:23,871
you're the man I need to go to.

148
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:26,307
Illegally?

149
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:31,613
Now, why would a Jedi need
to deliver arms illegally?

150
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:33,015
How about I pay you well enough

151
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,617
that you just deliver
the missiles for me

152
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,519
and don't ask any questions?

153
00:11:38,556 --> 00:11:42,092
Well, as long as you're not
paying me in credits,

154
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,497
I'm sure I could accommodate
your wishes, Master Jedi.

155
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:54,905
The highlands may slow down
the droids,

156
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:56,840
but they won't stop the gunships.

157
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,576
We have to move.

158
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,612
Any word from Master Skywalker?

159
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,146
Not yet.

160
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,384
We're not giving up yet.

161
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,286
Stagger our defenses to the camp.

162
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:11,456
Secure the approach.
Stay in small teams.

163
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:12,891
Make use of our training.

164
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,693
You really are
the best leader among us.

165
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:19,063
Couldn't be more proud
of you, my sister.

166
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:22,400
I learned from the best, big brother.

167
00:12:22,468 --> 00:12:25,436
Let's go, General.

168
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:26,838
You have to help us.

169
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,141
I'll do all I can to protect you,

170
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,645
but I can't fight this war for you.

171
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:36,381
We wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

172
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:38,249
I wish I could do more.

173
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,784
Wait.

174
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:42,519
Looks like we have company.

175
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:53,698
Don't shoot!

176
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:08,047
Well, you could be
my new favorite spice.

177
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:10,016
Yeah, I don't think so.

178
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,417
Careful, pirate.

179
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:14,220
Hondo, what are you doing here?

180
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,656
Oh, no, no, no.

181
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,958
You should thank me, child.

182
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:22,028
I have brought you a gift
from Skywalker and Kenobi.

183
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,162
The latest from Sienar.

184
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,430
Rocket launchers?

185
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:28,834
Shoulder-fired.
Very expensive.

186
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,168
Paid for?

187
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,104
Very handsome...

188
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,539
Oh!
Oh, my, look at the time.

189
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:40,079
Well, my work here is done.

190
00:13:57,895 --> 00:14:00,630
Ugh, they must have seen Hondo's ship.

191
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:02,733
It was only a patrol.

192
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,969
We have to get these
down to the others.

193
00:14:05,036 --> 00:14:06,203
Load them up.

194
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,504
I hope they work.

195
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,573
There's only one way to find out.

196
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:22,373
We've tried everything,

197
00:14:22,397 --> 00:14:24,732
but we're target practice
for those gunships.

198
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,567
Now it's their turn.

199
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:27,835
Thank the Jedi.

200
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:31,405
Saw!

201
00:14:41,783 --> 00:14:44,384
I love this!

202
00:14:48,723 --> 00:14:50,491
Distribute the rocket launchers

203
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,393
and take out those gunships.

204
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:54,295
Steela, they're attacking the nest.

205
00:14:54,363 --> 00:14:55,396
They're after the king!

206
00:14:55,464 --> 00:14:57,431
Come on!

207
00:15:03,104 --> 00:15:05,138
She sure leads by example.

208
00:15:05,206 --> 00:15:08,442
What good will that do us
if she gets herself killed?

209
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:22,591
Steela, hurry!
Steela, come in!

210
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,659
Ugh!

211
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,429
Where is the false king?

212
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,131
I'll never tell you!

213
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,632
Ugh!

214
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,135
Find the king.

215
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:52,289
Help has arrived!

216
00:16:39,705 --> 00:16:42,140
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

217
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,342
Thanks to you.

218
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,410
Fire!

219
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:50,614
Last one's mine.

220
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:57,355
Get down!

221
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:14,607
Look!

222
00:17:27,154 --> 00:17:30,523
Hang... on!

223
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:35,362
Steela!

224
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,433
Ah!

225
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:48,843
I'll handle this.

226
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:53,648
I got you.

227
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:40,026
Your gunships have failed.

228
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:42,295
I need more reinforcements.

229
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:43,763
<i>Really?</i>

230
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,302
<i>General Kalani, what is your
assessment of the situation?</i>

231
00:18:47,369 --> 00:18:49,871
They have managed
to penetrate our shields

232
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,973
and are using the cover
of the highlands

233
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:54,143
against our forces.

234
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:57,847
To defeat them will take time.

235
00:18:57,914 --> 00:19:01,617
<i>A prolonged war does not
interest me, General.</i>

236
00:19:01,685 --> 00:19:05,922
<i>Their rebellion grows
with every small victory.</i>

237
00:19:05,989 --> 00:19:08,658
Then we are lost.

238
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:11,761
<i>Salvage the remaining arms
and withdraw the army.</i>

239
00:19:11,829 --> 00:19:15,699
<i>Bring them to Agamar.</i>

240
00:19:15,766 --> 00:19:16,766
What about...

241
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:17,767
Ugh!

242
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:29,446
It was my fault.

243
00:19:29,514 --> 00:19:31,482
I shot that gunship down,

244
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,285
and it crashed into her position.

245
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,387
Saw, it's not your fault.

246
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,489
She knew what the risks were.

247
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:43,727
We all knew what it would take
to free Onderon.

248
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,710
This has been quite a journey
for our Padawan.

249
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,846
Steela will be a powerful
spirit in their lives.

250
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:36,748
Yes.

251
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:38,483
For all of us.

252
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:45,824
I'm sorry for your loss.

253
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,162
Thanks, but it's over now.

254
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,231
Let's just leave it at that.

255
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,402
Steela would be glad.

256
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,373
Her sacrifice gave Onderon
its freedom.

257
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,508
But at what cost?

258
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,277
It's like you once said.

259
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:05,579
Many lives get caught

260
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,748
between the Republic
and the Separatists.

261
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:10,884
I did say that once,
but after watching your heroics

262
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:12,853
and the selflessness of the Jedi,

263
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:16,423
I do believe the Republic
is the right side to be on.

264
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:18,092
What do you mean?

265
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,895
Dendup has appointed me
the new Senator of Onderon.

266
00:21:20,963 --> 00:21:23,231
I will follow
in my mother's footsteps,

267
00:21:23,299 --> 00:21:25,800
and I will bring us back
to the Republic.

268
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:28,470
Remember this day,

269
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:32,407
the day Onderon became free again.

1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,721
<i>Ancient Jedi tradition!</i>

2
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:24,224
<i>Six younglings are sent
to the secret caverns of Ilum,</i>

3
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,192
<i>where they are tested
by The Gathering,</i>

4
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,827
<i>an ancient Jedi ritual</i>

5
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:30,130
<i>where each youngling
must harvest a crystal,</i>

6
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,365
<i>around which they will construct
their own lightsaber.</i>

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,136
<i>Along the journey,
they underwent great perils,</i>

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,639
<i>hardest of which
was to face themselves.</i>

9
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,874
<i>Now, having passed the test,</i>

10
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:46,412
<i>they take their first step
into a larger world.</i>

11
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:08,198
I call that move
the "Whirlwind of Destiny".

12
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:09,667
Showoff.

13
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:14,370
Can everyone gather around, please?

14
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:20,409
You have all successfully passed
The Gathering

15
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:22,343
and harvested your crystals.

16
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:27,181
So when do we start
to build our sabers?

17
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,083
Place your crystals on the table.

18
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:31,050
Your lesson begins now.

19
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:36,322
May I introduce you to architect
and lightsaber designer Huyang?

20
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:47,966
These are them.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,303
I swear they get younger
every expedition.

22
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,905
All have passed The Gathering?

23
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,107
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,541
Are you sure?

25
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,942
But he's a droid.

26
00:01:57,977 --> 00:02:00,645
You expect us to learn from a droid?

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,581
Who said that?

28
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,217
Many years I have been on this ship,

29
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:07,852
teaching many a Jedi before you,

30
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:10,422
and I will continue teaching
many a Jedi after you.

31
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,391
Call me what you want,
but inside my memory banks,

32
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,194
I contain a record
of every lightsaber ever made

33
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:17,728
and the Jedi who fashioned them.

34
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:18,796
Whoa!
Look at that!

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,697
Which will you choose?
A simple grip?

36
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:22,431
The curved approach?

37
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:25,167
One inlaid with the bone
of the Cartusion whale,

38
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,003
pastillion ore, or black onk?

39
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,771
Well?

40
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:33,039
From Battles of Rashfond
to the Peacekeeping of Parliock

41
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:34,641
to our very own Clone Wars,

42
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:38,043
the lightsaber is a Jedi's
only true ally.

43
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,577
But how do they work, hmm?

44
00:02:39,612 --> 00:02:42,080
Yes, you have brought me crystals,

45
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:44,515
but they're all useless
unless you give them life.

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,485
Do you know how to awaken
the Force within the crystal?

47
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:50,320
No?

48
00:02:50,354 --> 00:02:52,155
Then I suggest you listen and learn

49
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,059
until you think of a question
this droid cannot answer.

50
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,961
A Wookiee.

51
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,530
Rare you are to the Jedi.

52
00:03:00,564 --> 00:03:02,432
Proud your people must be.

53
00:03:03,634 --> 00:03:06,334
Unique, just as
your lightsaber will be.

54
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:09,604
Hold out your hand, Wookiee.

55
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:12,506
Describe what you see
your saber to be.

56
00:03:15,843 --> 00:03:18,044
No, no, no, not what you imagine

57
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,380
but what you feel in your hand.

58
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,781
Concentrate.

59
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,250
What will make you strong in battle

60
00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,086
and humble in retreat?

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,255
What connects with your Force?

62
00:03:34,028 --> 00:03:38,530
Ah, yes, wood.
Not a common choice.

63
00:03:38,564 --> 00:03:40,365
And only wood from the brylark tree

64
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:41,666
is as strong as metal.

65
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:42,901
Let me see.

66
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:45,870
Where would we find that
all the way out here,

67
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:50,107
far from anywhere, deep in space?

68
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:55,110
Let's see what we have.

69
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,646
Let me see.
Let me...

70
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:00,516
Yes, yes, yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

71
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,351
Ah, I wondered where I put that.

72
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,221
Oh, that's not mine.

73
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:10,725
Ah, ah, what do we have here?

74
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,297
- Whoa, look at that.
- Ooh.

75
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,266
- Ooh.
- Wow.

76
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,801
You can say that again.

77
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:22,935
Wow.

78
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,605
It is my job,
before you leave this ship,

79
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:27,073
you will have everything you need

80
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,507
to build your lightsabers

81
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,675
and the knowledge of how to do it.

82
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,977
So let us begin.

83
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:34,713
There is much more work to be done.

84
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:48,892
Well, where are they?

85
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:51,862
The Jedi ship
is right in front of us, sir.

86
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:55,398
Lose them, and you'll lose
more than your head.

87
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,234
Our attack must be swift
and devastating.

88
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,403
They cannot have time to get away.

89
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:06,041
I thought we weren't going
to mess with Jedi anymore.

90
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:08,110
These aren't Jedi.

91
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,746
My sources say
they're just younglings,

92
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,250
headed back to the Jedi Temple
from a training mission

93
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:18,386
with the most important treasure
in the universe...

94
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:22,856
Kiber crystals,
used for making laser swords.

95
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,494
The price for just one
would make a man rich,

96
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:32,398
and we all know how much
I like to be rich, don't we?

97
00:05:47,445 --> 00:05:49,646
What's the rush, Petro?

98
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:52,148
With this lightsaber,

99
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,650
I'm going to challenge
Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel

100
00:05:54,684 --> 00:05:56,285
and kill Grievous.

101
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:09,776
The only person
you are going to kill with that,

102
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:11,765
my young friend, is yourself.

103
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,701
You have inverted the emitter matrix,

104
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:16,237
which will cause the power grid
to backfire.

105
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:18,206
Light this, and all that will be left

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,540
of you and your lightsaber

107
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:20,975
will be your crystal.

108
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:22,343
Start again,

109
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:26,681
and this time,
please follow the diagram.

110
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:43,197
Remember, quiet your mind
and concentrate.

111
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:46,733
The design will become clear.

112
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:49,302
Good. Gently.

113
00:06:49,337 --> 00:06:50,670
Trust the Force.

114
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:52,739
What was that?

115
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:54,974
I don't know.
Hold on.

116
00:06:59,913 --> 00:07:01,446
R2, what's happened?

117
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:05,717
Where?

118
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,119
Oh, no.

119
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:12,269
Ugh, they're aiming for the hyperdrive.

120
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,643
Get us out of here!

121
00:07:24,621 --> 00:07:26,654
I don't like the sound of that.

122
00:07:26,688 --> 00:07:29,190
Stay here.
I'll check on the younglings.

123
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:35,229
Excellent shot.

124
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:37,364
Fire the grappling harpoons.

125
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:47,240
Now reel them in,
and let's get what we came for.

126
00:08:26,843 --> 00:08:28,143
What's happening?

127
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:29,711
We're being boarded.

128
00:08:29,746 --> 00:08:31,513
Here? Why?

129
00:08:31,547 --> 00:08:33,649
I don't know.

130
00:08:33,683 --> 00:08:35,549
Quickly, give me your crystals,

131
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,917
and I will hold on to them
until we are safe.

132
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,925
Younglings! Younglings!

133
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,659
Who's attacking the ship?

134
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,066
Pirates.

135
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:34,635
Pirates?
They'll kill us all.

136
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,906
Perhaps we should hide
in the ventilation shaft.

137
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,141
Follow me.

138
00:09:41,176 --> 00:09:42,909
Hiding is for cowards.

139
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,577
We should stand and fight.

140
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:47,981
Huh, we're gonna fight,
just not the way they expect.

141
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,951
Time to go.

142
00:09:51,985 --> 00:09:53,986
Is this part of our training?

143
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,254
It is now.

144
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,067
Shh.

145
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,996
Hondo says find the kids
and bring 'em to him.

146
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,298
Dead or alive?

147
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,633
Yes.

148
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,138
We must have courage, young Jedi.

149
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:25,041
Ganodi and Zatt, I need you
to get to the cockpit,

150
00:10:25,075 --> 00:10:27,309
find R2, and secure it.

151
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,878
The rest of you, take Professor Huyang

152
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,847
and seal yourselves inside the hold,

153
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,581
and wait for my command.

154
00:10:33,615 --> 00:10:35,716
What are you going to do?

155
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,619
I'm going to reroute
enough power to the engines

156
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:41,221
so that we can break free
of the pirate ship's hold on us.

157
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:42,689
Okay?

158
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:45,725
Wh... what about the pirates
already on board the ship?

159
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,727
Once the docking tube is ruptured,

160
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:50,629
when the ships pull apart,
a vacuum will be created,

161
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:53,765
which will suck the pirates
off our ship and into space.

162
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,435
Will we be sucked into space?

163
00:10:56,469 --> 00:11:00,338
No, the cockpit and the hold
will be sealed

164
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,140
and still have air.

165
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:06,343
Do not, and I mean, do not
engage the pirates.

166
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:08,911
Your only job is to stay hidden.

167
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:10,613
Do you understand?

168
00:11:12,115 --> 00:11:13,115
Now go.

169
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,058
I smell profit!

170
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,530
Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits.

171
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,830
Well?

172
00:11:32,865 --> 00:11:36,334
Well, we've secured the ship,
but she seems deserted.

173
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:37,869
Imbecile!

174
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:40,405
That is the oldest trick in the book.

175
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,175
The runts are probably hiding
in the ventilation system.

176
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,043
Oh. Right.

177
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,177
Didn't think of that.

178
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,279
Why does that not surprise me?

179
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:52,448
All that matters is you find
the younglings

180
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:54,617
and bring me the crystals.

181
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:57,819
If anything gets in the way, kill it.

182
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:01,956
But, boss, they're just kids.

183
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:05,160
They're just kids.
When will they learn?

184
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:07,695
In case you lack motivation,

185
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:10,564
remember that on the black market,

186
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:13,601
these crystals are priceless.

187
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,371
We can't fit in there.

188
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,241
Smoke them out.

189
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:23,442
You heard the boss.

190
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:40,626
I do love me a party.

191
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,682
Hold it!

192
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,487
Get off him!

193
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:11,788
Easy, there.

194
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,490
That's no way to make friends,
now, is it?

195
00:13:19,229 --> 00:13:20,229
Thanks, buddy.

196
00:13:23,508 --> 00:13:24,942
Come on, keep up.

197
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:26,511
The hold is not much further.

198
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,280
Something's wrong.

199
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:45,610
Unhand me, brigand!

200
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,864
Well, hello, girls and boys.

201
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:52,735
We've been looking forward
to meetin' ya.

202
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,681
Now, be nice,
and hand over your crystals.

203
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,305
Over my dead body.

204
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:06,641
That can be arranged.

205
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,846
Petro, no.

206
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:14,882
Your emitter matrix is still inverted.

207
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,719
So which one of you is first?

208
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:21,488
All bark, no bite.

209
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:24,358
Ah, that's for me.

210
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:27,061
I always wanted one of these.

211
00:14:27,095 --> 00:14:29,197
You sure you can handle it?

212
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,467
Huh?

213
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:35,703
Everybody get down!

214
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,245
Let's go.

215
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,146
Hurry, hurry.
This way, younglings.

216
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,694
You could have killed him.

217
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:05,628
Look, we can keep running,
or we can stand and fight

218
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,198
and show these pirates
we're not afraid.

219
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,635
I cannot approve of such action.

220
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:15,004
Besides, I have been damaged
and cannot aid you in battle.

221
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,675
Petro's right.

222
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,843
It's our only choice:

223
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,713
fight or be killed.

224
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,022
Zatt, <i>come in</i>.

225
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:37,659
<i>I am over</i> riding
the emergency power fail-safe

226
00:15:37,693 --> 00:15:39,594
<i>and routing energy to the engines.</i>

227
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:40,795
It's working.

228
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:42,196
Any word from the others?

229
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,798
Have they reached the hold?

230
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:47,234
- Uh, not yet.
- <i>Where are they?</i>

231
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:50,203
I don't know.
I didn't hear from them.

232
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:53,306
Great.
I know what that means.

233
00:15:58,532 --> 00:16:00,980
Set them to the highest level.

234
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,921
Get him!

235
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,289
Gungi!

236
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,700
Here, kiddie kiddies.

237
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,303
You can come out now.

238
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,772
No one's gonna hurt you.

239
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:36,275
Zatt, close the door
to the training room.

240
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,076
<i>Katooni, where are you guys?</i>

241
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,912
No time to explain.
Just close the door.

242
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:42,246
R2, close the door!

243
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,718
Hey, what's... what's going on?

244
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,308
We can't make it.

245
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,746
There are too many blocking the hold.

246
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:29,357
Well, children,
you have put up quite a fight,

247
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,526
but playtime is over.

248
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,662
Now, hand over my crystals,

249
00:17:34,697 --> 00:17:37,297
and no one gets hurt... much.

250
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,537
Hondo, the Jedi Council

251
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:47,306
will not take kindly to this attack.

252
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,811
Ahsoka, how will they know
who is responsible

253
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:55,847
if there is no one left
to tell the tale?

254
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:59,251
You seem less hospitable
than our last meeting.

255
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:02,119
My mood is based on profit,

256
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:06,323
and today I am in the mood
for crystals.

257
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,459
You want the crystals?

258
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:10,093
Come and get 'em.

259
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,667
Oh, easy, now.

260
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:21,737
Hurry, hurry.

261
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:22,939
What about Ahsoka?

262
00:18:22,973 --> 00:18:25,174
Trust her.
Now, get in there.

263
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:27,042
Oh!

264
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:29,043
How dare you?

265
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:31,079
I've lived on this ship
a thousand years

266
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:32,547
and never lost a fight.

267
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,449
I'm not about to start today.

268
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:46,993
You know, had I known you were here,

269
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:50,965
I would have simply asked
for the crystals directly,

270
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:53,099
and we could have avoided all of this.

271
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,901
I don't want to hurt you, Hondo.

272
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:58,805
I know, and I appreciate that.

273
00:19:00,274 --> 00:19:01,640
We're all in the hold,

274
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,642
but Ahsoka's still out there
fighting the pirates.

275
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,877
Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in.

276
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,279
They've made it to the hold.

277
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,814
Then what are you waiting for?

278
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,181
But what about you?

279
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,215
Do it!

280
00:19:37,272 --> 00:19:38,839
What are you doing?

281
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,275
Getting you off my ship.

282
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:45,946
Oh!

283
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,247
Whoa!

284
00:19:51,018 --> 00:19:53,753
Whoa, whoa, ah!

285
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:14,271
Whoa!

286
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,844
We're all clear.

287
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,313
Make the jump to hyperspace.

288
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,114
Ah, ah, ah!

289
00:20:37,226 --> 00:20:39,260
Yes! We did it!

290
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,328
They're off the ship.

291
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,167
Oh, Professor.

292
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:50,404
Bring him here.
I'll fix him.

293
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:55,040
You should have seen Ahsoka.
She took them on all by herself.

294
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:57,510
Where is Padawan Tano?

295
00:20:57,544 --> 00:21:00,245
Padawan Tano, come in.

296
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:02,981
Ahsoka.

297
00:21:03,016 --> 00:21:06,685
Ahsoka!
Ahsoka, are you there?

298
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:18,560
You have cost me greatly today,
young one.

299
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:22,698
And since you lost me so much profit,

300
00:21:22,732 --> 00:21:25,333
I am left with no choice.

301
00:21:30,406 --> 00:21:36,110
But to turn you into profit.

302
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,046
Good night.

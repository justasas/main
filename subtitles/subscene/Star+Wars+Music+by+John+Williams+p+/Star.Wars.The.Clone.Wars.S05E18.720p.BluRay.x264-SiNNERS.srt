1
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,286
<i>Terror at the Temple!</i>

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,324
<i>The Jedi Temple is in disarray</i>

3
00:00:22,387 --> 00:00:24,623
<i>after a vicious terrorist attack.</i>

4
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,692
<i>Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano</i>

5
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,992
<i>set out to find the truth</i>

6
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:30,994
<i>of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.</i>

7
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:34,363
<i>Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,</i>

8
00:00:34,398 --> 00:00:36,032
<i>Letta Turmond.</i>

9
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:39,301
<i>Now the Jedi attempt to return
the Temple to normalcy.</i>

10
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:42,036
<i>But first Master Yoda must give a eulogy</i>

11
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:44,606
<i>to the fallen Jedi warriors.</i>

12
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:48,807
One with the Force, they are.

13
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:51,576
And our job it is
to remember that we will,

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,244
in time, also pass on.

15
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,178
Luminous beings are we,

16
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:58,947
but temporary vessels, our bodies are.

17
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:03,283
And we shall all find ourselves
here in time.

18
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:05,318
A moment of silence, I ask,

19
00:01:05,353 --> 00:01:09,055
to remember and to move on.

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,091
You were close to one of them?

21
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:15,859
Tutso Mara.

22
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,528
We trained together.

23
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,997
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

24
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:26,267
Live for the living Jedi, we must.

25
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:30,003
Live through us, forever they will.

26
00:01:51,353 --> 00:01:53,687
So what happens to Letta now?

27
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:54,921
The bomber has been moved.

28
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:56,022
Moved?

29
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,089
Where?

30
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,191
Why should she be moved?

31
00:01:59,225 --> 00:02:01,926
The Republic military
has taken her into custody.

32
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,459
But why?

33
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,695
This is a Jedi matter, isn't it?

34
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,029
Clones were killed,

35
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,697
which makes this terrorist attack

36
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:10,398
a military matter.

37
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:13,801
An attack on the Jedi
is an attack on the Senate.

38
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:15,635
Admiral Tarkin is right.

39
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,437
Letta isn't a Jedi.

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,204
It's not for us to be judge and jury

41
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:20,672
over a citizen of the Republic.

42
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:23,174
If Letta's guilty, she's guilty,

43
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:25,142
and she should be dealt with.

44
00:02:25,176 --> 00:02:26,577
Calm down, Ahsoka.

45
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,112
Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way.

46
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:34,215
The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka.

47
00:02:34,249 --> 00:02:36,550
Nothing will ever change.

48
00:02:36,584 --> 00:02:38,518
The Chancellor feels very strongly

49
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:39,819
that the Jedi be removed

50
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:43,354
from as many military matters
as possible.

51
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:46,556
You yourselves
said that you're peacekeepers,

52
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:48,425
not soldiers.

53
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,327
I hope Chancellor Palpatine
knows what he's doing.

54
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:53,562
I assure you
that he rarely does anything

55
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:55,197
without a strategy.

56
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:04,336
I have many things
to attend to, Masters.

57
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,038
Good day.

58
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:07,571
Ahsoka.

59
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:11,940
Go.

60
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:13,976
Be with your friend, Ahsoka.

61
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:19,580
In ways, she is still very young.

62
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:21,148
Indeed.

63
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:27,118
Company?

64
00:03:27,152 --> 00:03:28,553
Sure.

65
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:32,454
Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

66
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,091
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

67
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,559
Ahsoka, have you ever wondered

68
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,828
if it was right to ignore your emotions?

69
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:43,662
My Master would say,

70
00:03:43,696 --> 00:03:46,664
"Our struggle as Jedi
is to move past them."

71
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:48,299
You make it sound so easy.

72
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,068
No, it isn't easy.

73
00:03:51,103 --> 00:03:52,370
But it's possible.

74
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,538
Like, when we were stuck

75
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,372
inside the battle tank on Geonosis,

76
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:57,540
it was hard not to be afraid.

77
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,642
Still, you and I got past it.

78
00:03:59,677 --> 00:04:02,211
And I guess we'll get past this.

79
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:05,013
You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

80
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,476
I guess I've fooled you
like I have everyone else.

81
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,251
Yes, Master.

82
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:13,218
Ahsoka, we're needed in the war room.

83
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,620
It appears the Separatists
have mounted another attack.

84
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:18,322
Coming, Master.

85
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:21,724
Look, I have to believe
that one way or another,

86
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,659
this woman's going to pay
for what she did.

87
00:04:24,694 --> 00:04:28,028
You shouldn't keep your Master waiting.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,435
<i>We've uncovered
a Separatist plan of attack.</i>

89
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,570
<i>We shall travel
to the Anoat system here,</i>

90
00:04:41,605 --> 00:04:43,705
<i>then move across to Saleucami.</i>

91
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,808
So far out of our way?

92
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:49,244
<i>Unfortunately, we must avoid
these neutral systems.</i>

93
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:50,877
<i>Excuse me, Master Jedi.</i>

94
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,079
Yes, Admiral.

95
00:04:52,113 --> 00:04:53,747
<i>Commander Tano,</i>

96
00:04:53,782 --> 00:04:56,449
<i>your presence is requested
by prisoner Letta Turmond.</i>

97
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:58,016
The prisoner from the hangar bombing?

98
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,018
Why is she asking for Ahsoka?

99
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,220
<i>Not exactly sure.</i>

100
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,187
<i>But Commander Tano is the only person</i>

101
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:05,021
<i>the prisoner will speak to.</i>

102
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,191
I'll report back
with whatever I find out.

103
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,520
<i>Yes?</i>

104
00:05:50,554 --> 00:05:51,554
<i>I'm Commander Tano.</i>

105
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:53,789
<i>Letta Turmond requested to see me.</i>

106
00:05:53,823 --> 00:05:56,324
<i>A lot of innocent people
died in that blast.</i>

107
00:05:56,358 --> 00:05:57,892
<i>Good job capturing her.</i>

108
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,761
All right, scan her.

109
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,602
<i>Leave your comlink and lightsabers here.</i>

110
00:06:16,174 --> 00:06:17,807
Follow me.

111
00:06:42,358 --> 00:06:44,059
What do you want, Letta?

112
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:46,427
I was told if I ever needed help,

113
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,995
you were the Jedi to contact.

114
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:54,600
Give us a minute, please.

115
00:06:58,237 --> 00:06:59,903
You don't have much time, Letta,

116
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:02,239
so I suggest you get
whatever you have to say

117
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,873
off your chest.

118
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,178
The idea of feeding Jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

119
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,680
Why are you saying this now?

120
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,614
Why didn't you reveal this before?

121
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,916
Because my life is in danger.

122
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,851
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

123
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:19,986
unless you know the truth.

124
00:07:20,021 --> 00:07:22,322
Huh.
What's the truth?

125
00:07:22,356 --> 00:07:23,656
A Jedi.

126
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,891
A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb

127
00:07:25,926 --> 00:07:27,959
and how to put
the nano-droids in.

128
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:30,495
Why would a Jedi do this?

129
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,531
There are some citizens
of the Republic, like myself,

130
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:36,200
who believe the Jedi Order
is not what it used to be.

131
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:38,334
The Jedi have become warmongers.

132
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:40,169
They've become military weapons.

133
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:41,304
And they're killing

134
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,538
when they should be keeping the peace.

135
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:45,873
One of these Jedi agreed with us.

136
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:48,442
One of you wanted to make a statement

137
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,210
and was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

138
00:07:52,945 --> 00:07:54,246
Who?

139
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,747
If you protect me, I will tell you,

140
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:59,816
because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

141
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:03,252
Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

142
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:08,255
It's...

143
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,290
Letta!

144
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,324
Letta!

145
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,391
Letta!

146
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:13,493
Prisoner health critical,

147
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:16,161
holding cell 173.

148
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,762
Commander Fox, the prisoner.

149
00:08:18,797 --> 00:08:20,197
Follow me.

150
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:24,935
Letta!

151
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:34,943
I...
don't know what happened.

152
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:37,311
Commander, she's dead.

153
00:08:37,345 --> 00:08:40,146
I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano.

154
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:43,115
But all the same, you're under arrest.

155
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,251
I...
No, no.

156
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:47,285
I did not do this.

157
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,679
Admiral Tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

158
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,584
I went in the room to talk to Letta,

159
00:09:20,618 --> 00:09:23,052
and she said she was afraid of a Jedi.

160
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:29,556
You don't have to tell me
any more, Commander Tano.

161
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,824
I don't?

162
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:31,651
No.

163
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,026
There are recorders in every room.

164
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:38,963
Curiously, the sound
isn't working on this one.

165
00:09:41,398 --> 00:09:44,585
It seems the Jedi
she was afraid of was you.

166
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,101
I did not kill that woman.

167
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:48,636
You were the only one there.

168
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,079
I know that you were upset
when this woman

169
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,350
was taken into custody by the military.

170
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,706
That means nothing.

171
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:55,974
I beg to differ.

172
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,925
It was someone else, Admiral,

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,927
someone I didn't see.

174
00:09:59,962 --> 00:10:01,528
You know that is very difficult

175
00:10:01,562 --> 00:10:03,363
for me to believe.

176
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:05,464
This is a secure facility.

177
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:08,633
We do not have
just anyone running about.

178
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,069
And if there was someone else,

179
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:13,738
why did you not sense them?

180
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:25,614
I said my Padawan is in there.

181
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:27,081
Now, step aside.

182
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:28,883
General Skywalker,

183
00:10:28,917 --> 00:10:33,286
Admiral Tarkin has ordered
that no one be allowed in there.

184
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,321
I don't care what she's accused of.

185
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:37,622
Let me in.

186
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,294
Sorry, sir.

187
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,629
The admiral's orders stand.

188
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:47,764
This is now a military operation

189
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:50,166
and under his jurisdiction.

190
00:11:18,055 --> 00:11:19,955
A key card.

191
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:22,890
Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

192
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:37,435
I wonder what you have planned.

193
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,011
Oh, no.

194
00:11:49,045 --> 00:11:50,646
This does not look good.

195
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,886
My lightsabers.

196
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,290
Hello?

197
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:07,824
Who is this?

198
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:09,491
Why are you helping me?

199
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:12,961
What's going on here?

200
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:14,896
It wasn't me.

201
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,798
Alert!
Alert!

202
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,667
The Jedi prisoner has escaped.

203
00:12:39,414 --> 00:12:40,714
Commander Tano, stop!

204
00:12:44,884 --> 00:12:46,751
She's heading north
in the prison corridor.

205
00:12:46,786 --> 00:12:48,052
Cut her off!

206
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,319
Copy that.

207
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:11,535
Oh, no.

208
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,240
The suspect has killed three clones.

209
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:21,340
Code red.

210
00:13:21,374 --> 00:13:24,108
If you see the target, shoot to kill.

211
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:25,609
Belay that order, Commander Fox.

212
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:27,611
She's killed troopers.

213
00:13:27,645 --> 00:13:29,146
I know Commander Tano.

214
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,781
She would never do something like this.

215
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:33,082
Then who did?

216
00:13:33,117 --> 00:13:35,150
Quiet!

217
00:13:35,184 --> 00:13:36,384
Ahsoka!

218
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,319
It's me, Anakin.

219
00:13:41,223 --> 00:13:43,290
Stop running.

220
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:46,159
You can't help me, Master.

221
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,961
Someone's setting me up.

222
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,029
I believe you, Ahsoka.

223
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,731
But no one else will.

224
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,502
Keep searching until we find her.

225
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,702
Rex, call security.

226
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:01,904
Tell them we need
to search the entire base.

227
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:02,972
Now!

228
00:14:04,106 --> 00:14:05,540
General Skywalker has just issued

229
00:14:05,574 --> 00:14:08,342
an all-points bulletin
on Commander Ahsoka Tano.

230
00:14:08,376 --> 00:14:09,710
She's killed three clones

231
00:14:09,744 --> 00:14:13,078
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

232
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:31,596
The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

233
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,846
cell block 1218-11.

234
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:16,516
Come on, Grizzer.

235
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,950
There's nothing here.

236
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:26,490
There she is!

237
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,658
Quick, stop her
before she gets to the ship!

238
00:16:00,764 --> 00:16:02,945
All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

239
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,098
What's going on?

240
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:04,917
We've found her.

241
00:16:05,037 --> 00:16:06,838
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

242
00:16:06,868 --> 00:16:08,501
Set weapons to stun.

243
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,702
I want her alive!

244
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:56,033
Do not shoot to kill.

245
00:16:56,068 --> 00:16:58,067
Do not shoot to kill!

246
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,102
Try to box her in.

247
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,203
Don't let her escape.

248
00:17:00,237 --> 00:17:02,104
Tell me what you see, Oddball.

249
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:17,782
She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

250
00:17:32,126 --> 00:17:33,626
All right, we got her now.

251
00:17:46,736 --> 00:17:48,937
This will knock her off her feet.

252
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,018
Not so fast, Commander.

253
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,502
Ahsoka!

254
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:11,736
Ahsoka, what are you doing?

255
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,371
You didn't even try to come and help me.

256
00:20:14,405 --> 00:20:16,039
They wouldn't let me in to talk to you.

257
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:18,173
You could have if you tried.

258
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,543
How would that look, Ahsoka, huh?

259
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:21,743
Forcing my way in

260
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:23,379
would've made you look even more guilty.

261
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:25,579
I'm not guilty!

262
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,981
Then we have to prove you're innocent.

263
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:30,583
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

264
00:20:30,617 --> 00:20:32,717
I don't know who to trust.

265
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,920
Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, Ahsoka,

266
00:20:35,954 --> 00:20:37,121
never.

267
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,789
But you need to come back

268
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:40,557
and make your case to the Council.

269
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:42,126
No.

270
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,361
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

271
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:48,431
I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

272
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:50,966
and come with me now!

273
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,034
Trust me.

274
00:20:52,068 --> 00:20:54,636
General Skywalker, where are you?

275
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,138
I do trust you.

276
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,205
But you know as well as I do

277
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,607
that no one else will believe me.

278
00:21:03,877 --> 00:21:07,434
Anakin, you have to trust <i>me</i> now.

279
00:21:07,554 --> 00:21:09,447
Ahsoka, I do trust you.

280
00:21:09,481 --> 00:21:11,147
I know you do.

281
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,516
Wish me luck.

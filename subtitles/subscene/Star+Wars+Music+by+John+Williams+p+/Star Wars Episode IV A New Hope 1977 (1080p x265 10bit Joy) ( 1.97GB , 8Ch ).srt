2
00:02:47,457 --> 00:02:49,542
Did you hear that?

3
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,420
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

4
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:57,421
This is madness.

5
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,852
We're doomed.

6
00:03:07,853 --> 00:03:12,853
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

7
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:18,442
What's that?

8
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:02,212
R2-D2, where are you?

9
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,816
At last. Where have you been?

10
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:22,027
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

11
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:26,699
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

12
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

13
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:45,009
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

14
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,136
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

15
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:50,055
What have you done with those plans?

16
00:05:50,056 --> 00:05:53,017
We intercepted no transmissions.

17
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:57,104
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

18
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:02,105
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

19
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:08,782
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

20
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:13,783
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

21
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:29,216
There's one. Set for stun.

22
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:33,224
She'll be all right.

23
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:36,727
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

24
00:06:36,728 --> 00:06:39,313
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

25
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:43,234
You'll be deactivated for sure.

26
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,945
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

27
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:49,990
Come out, before somebody sees you.

28
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:52,284
Secret mission? What plans?

29
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:57,285
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

30
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,250
I'm going to regret this.

31
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:11,053
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

32
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:12,471
It must have short-circuited.

33
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:17,472
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

34
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:23,144
Are you sure this thing is safe?

35
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:41,667
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

36
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:45,379
The imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic-

37
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,548
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

38
00:07:47,549 --> 00:07:49,550
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

39
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:53,762
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

40
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:56,724
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

41
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,851
I don't know what you're talking about.

42
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:01,937
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

43
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:04,898
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

44
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:09,899
Take her away!

45
00:08:11,197 --> 00:08:12,781
Holding her is dangerous.

46
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:16,410
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

47
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,871
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

48
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:21,665
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

49
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,667
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

50
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:25,419
Leave that to me.

51
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,006
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

52
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,217
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

53
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,761
and no transmissions were made.

54
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:38,057
An escape pod wasjettisoned during the fighting,
but no life-forms were aboard.

55
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:41,143
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

56
00:08:41,144 --> 00:08:44,813
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

57
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:46,982
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

58
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:51,983
Yes, sir.

59
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:05,250
How did we get into this mess?

60
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,337
I really don't know how.

61
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:13,338
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

62
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:19,177
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
Myjoints are almost frozen.

63
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:29,813
What a desolate place this is.

64
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:33,153
Where do you think you're going?

65
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:35,447
Well, I'm not going that way.

66
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:37,533
It's much too rocky.

67
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:39,535
This way is much easier.

68
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:43,705
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

69
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:46,750
Don't get technical with me.

70
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,671
What mission? What are you talking about?

71
00:09:50,672 --> 00:09:53,924
L'vejust about had enough of you.

72
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,342
Go that way.

73
00:09:55,343 --> 00:09:58,887
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

74
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,014
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

75
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:06,015
because you won't get it.

76
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,782
No more adventures.

77
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:23,783
I'm not going that way.

78
00:10:54,694 --> 00:10:58,697
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

79
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,991
He tricked me into going this way...

80
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:05,992
but he'll do no better.

81
00:11:06,164 --> 00:11:08,373
Wait. What's that?

82
00:11:08,374 --> 00:11:11,210
A transport. I'm saved.

83
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:13,045
Over here!

84
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:15,756
Hey! Hey!

85
00:11:15,757 --> 00:11:20,757
Help! Please help!

86
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:54,721
R2?

87
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:59,934
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

88
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:36,308
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

89
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:41,309
Look, sir. Droids.

90
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:54,326
We stopped.

91
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:59,327
Wake up. Wake up!

92
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:08,044
We're doomed.

93
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,470
Do you think they'll melt us down?

94
00:16:27,735 --> 00:16:30,028
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

95
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:35,029
Will this never end?

96
00:17:11,779 --> 00:17:14,447
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

97
00:17:14,448 --> 00:17:19,369
Luke!

98
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,370
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

99
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:29,542
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but <i>I'll</i> remind him.

100
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,473
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

101
00:17:40,474 --> 00:17:44,227
No, not that one.

102
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:47,272
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

103
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:51,359
Protocol? it's my primary function, sir.
lam well-versed in all the customs-

104
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,779
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

105
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,616
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed-

106
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:01,745
I need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

107
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:05,123
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

108
00:18:05,124 --> 00:18:07,375
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

109
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:11,004
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. it's like a second language.

110
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:13,298
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

111
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:16,968
Luke!

112
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:19,721
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

113
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:22,724
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

114
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:25,060
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

115
00:18:25,061 --> 00:18:28,688
Now come on. Get to it.

116
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:32,609
All right. Come on.

117
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,820
And the red one. Come on.

118
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:40,821
Come on, red. Let's go.

119
00:18:57,176 --> 00:18:59,427
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

120
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:02,263
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

121
00:19:02,264 --> 00:19:07,264
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

122
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:12,687
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

123
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,734
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

124
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:18,613
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

125
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:19,906
Take this away.

126
00:19:19,907 --> 00:19:21,574
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

127
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:24,577
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

128
00:19:24,578 --> 00:19:29,578
Here he comes.

129
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,793
Okay. Let's go.

130
00:19:31,794 --> 00:19:33,128
Don't you forget this.

131
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:38,129
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

132
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:47,559
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

133
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,229
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination,
I can barely move.

134
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,939
It just isn't fair.

135
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,401
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

136
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,403
Is there anything I might do to help?

137
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,698
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

138
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,450
or teleport me off this rock.

139
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:05,118
I don't think so, sir.

140
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:08,246
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.

141
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,248
Not on this planet, anyway.

142
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:13,752
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

143
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:15,962
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

144
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:18,298
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

145
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:20,925
I see, sir.

146
00:20:20,926 --> 00:20:24,763
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

147
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,890
Just Luke.

148
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:30,143
And I am C-3 PO, human-cyborg relations.

149
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,896
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

150
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,607
Hello.

151
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:39,152
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

152
00:20:39,153 --> 00:20:40,445
With all we've been through...

153
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,781
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

154
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,532
what with the rebellion and all.

155
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,576
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

156
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:50,080
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

157
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,499
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

158
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,501
There's not much to tell.

159
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:58,171
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

160
00:20:58,172 --> 00:21:01,424
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

161
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,426
Well, my little friend...

162
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:05,595
you got somethingjammed
in here real good.

163
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,931
Were you on a Starcruiser or-

164
00:21:07,932 --> 00:21:11,101
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

165
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:12,811
What's this?

166
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:16,022
“What is what”?
He asked you a question. What is that?

167
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:21,023
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

168
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:28,405
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

169
00:21:29,453 --> 00:21:31,913
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

170
00:21:31,914 --> 00:21:34,332
Old data. Pay it no mind.

171
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,501
Who is she? She's beautiful.

172
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:39,963
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

173
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,215
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

174
00:21:42,216 --> 00:21:44,300
A person of some importance, I believe.

175
00:21:44,301 --> 00:21:48,721
- Our captain was-
- Is there any more to this recording?

176
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:52,142
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

177
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:55,019
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

178
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,356
<i>You're my only hope.</i>

179
00:21:58,357 --> 00:22:02,777
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
a resident of these parts...

180
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:04,654
and it's a private message for him.

181
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:06,781
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

182
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:08,867
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

183
00:22:08,868 --> 00:22:13,621
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

184
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:16,875
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

185
00:22:16,876 --> 00:22:19,627
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

186
00:22:19,628 --> 00:22:22,881
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

187
00:22:22,882 --> 00:22:25,133
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

188
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:28,136
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

189
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:30,138
I wonder who she is.

190
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:35,139
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

191
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,190
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

192
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:43,109
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

193
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,945
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

194
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:48,156
Oh, yeah. Well...

195
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:51,743
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

196
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:55,830
Okay.

197
00:22:55,831 --> 00:22:59,000
There you go.

198
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:02,420
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

199
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:04,547
“What message”?

200
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:05,924
The one you'vejust been playing.

201
00:23:05,925 --> 00:23:08,176
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

202
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:10,595
Luke!Luke!

203
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:12,931
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

204
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:16,142
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

205
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:21,143
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

206
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:26,236
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

207
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:28,696
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

208
00:23:28,697 --> 00:23:33,697
No, I don't like you either.

209
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,753
- I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

210
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:46,798
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

211
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,799
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

212
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:57,096
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

213
00:23:57,268 --> 00:23:59,560
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

214
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:02,897
That wizard'sjust a crazy old man.

215
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,442
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

216
00:24:06,443 --> 00:24:10,238
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

217
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:12,991
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

218
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:15,451
He won't.

219
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:19,163
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

220
00:24:19,164 --> 00:24:23,418
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

221
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:27,088
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

222
00:24:27,089 --> 00:24:31,134
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge,
working on those condensers.

223
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,761
Yes, sir.

224
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:36,556
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

225
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:40,018
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement-

226
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,188
about me staying on another season.

227
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:48,443
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

228
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,445
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

229
00:24:50,446 --> 00:24:52,363
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

230
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,490
Harvest is when I need you the most.

231
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:56,617
It's only one season more.

232
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:59,871
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

233
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:03,082
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

234
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:05,209
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

235
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,212
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

236
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:10,381
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

237
00:25:10,382 --> 00:25:12,967
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

238
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,844
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

239
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:18,306
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

240
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:21,017
It means so much to him.

241
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:25,146
<i>I'll</i> make it up to him next year.
I promise.

242
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:29,859
Lul<e'sjust not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

243
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:34,860
That's what I'm afraid of.

244
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:23,788
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

245
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:25,665
Please don't deactivate me.

246
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:28,418
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

247
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:33,419
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

248
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:42,598
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

249
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,309
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

250
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,645
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

251
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,440
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

252
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:51,482
Blast it!

253
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:54,193
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

254
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:57,488
It's too dangerous with the Sandpeople around.
We'll have to wait till morning.

255
00:26:57,489 --> 00:26:59,574
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

256
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:02,201
I'll be there in a few minutes.

257
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:04,829
Boy, am I gonna get it.

258
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:06,873
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

259
00:27:06,874 --> 00:27:09,959
He excels at that, sir.

260
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Come on.

261
00:27:31,523 --> 00:27:33,524
Have you seen Luke this morning?

262
00:27:33,525 --> 00:27:37,028
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

263
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:40,781
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

264
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:43,701
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

265
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:46,370
or there'll be hell to pay.

266
00:27:46,371 --> 00:27:49,040
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

267
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:54,041
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

268
00:28:14,483 --> 00:28:17,443
Where do you think you're going?

269
00:28:17,444 --> 00:28:19,445
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

270
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:23,616
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

271
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:25,368
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

272
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,579
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

273
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:32,083
No. it's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

274
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:34,126
What's wrong with him now?

275
00:28:34,127 --> 00:28:37,046
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

276
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:41,092
Sandpeople. Or worse.

277
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:42,760
Come on. Let's go have a look.

278
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:46,472
Come on.

279
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:50,309
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any-

280
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,186
Wait a second.

281
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:57,187
They're Sandpeople, all right.
I can see one of them now.

282
00:30:09,681 --> 00:30:13,267
Hello there.

283
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:18,268
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

284
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:24,274
Don't worry. <i>He'll</i> be all right.

285
00:30:27,199 --> 00:30:30,576
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

286
00:30:30,577 --> 00:30:35,577
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

287
00:30:36,792 --> 00:30:39,085
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

288
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:41,170
Boy, am I glad to see you.

289
00:30:41,171 --> 00:30:46,171
Thejundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

290
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:51,681
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

291
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:55,309
This little droid.

292
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,977
I think he's searching for his former master...

293
00:30:56,978 --> 00:31:01,190
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

294
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:04,360
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

295
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:08,531
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

296
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:12,576
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

297
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:14,995
Obi-Wan.

298
00:31:14,996 --> 00:31:19,750
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

299
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:22,753
A longtime.

300
00:31:22,754 --> 00:31:25,756
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

301
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:27,550
He's not dead.

302
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,843
Not yet.

303
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,929
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

304
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,016
He's me.

305
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:39,353
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

306
00:31:39,354 --> 00:31:42,106
since, oh, before you were born.

307
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,816
Then the droid does belong to you.

308
00:31:43,817 --> 00:31:48,320
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

309
00:31:48,321 --> 00:31:51,866
Very interesting.

310
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:54,452
I think we better get indoors.

311
00:31:54,453 --> 00:31:57,246
The Sandpeople are easily startled...

312
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:02,247
but they'll soon be back-
and in greater numbers.

313
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:08,044
3P0.

314
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,808
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

315
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:21,145
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

316
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:23,981
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

317
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:28,982
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

318
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,071
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

319
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:36,072
Quickly. They're on the move.

320
00:32:38,288 --> 00:32:41,749
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

321
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,586
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

322
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:49,423
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

323
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,842
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

324
00:32:51,843 --> 00:32:56,843
I was once ajedi knight,
the same as your father.

325
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,892
I wish I'd known him.

326
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:03,521
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

327
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:05,523
and a cunning warrior.

328
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:10,277
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

329
00:33:10,278 --> 00:33:13,239
And he was a good friend.

330
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,449
Which reminds <i>me...</i>

331
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,453
I have something here for you.

332
00:33:19,454 --> 00:33:22,164
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

333
00:33:22,165 --> 00:33:25,709
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

334
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,920
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

335
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:31,465
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

336
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:34,510
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

337
00:33:34,511 --> 00:33:38,764
Sure. Go ahead.

338
00:33:38,765 --> 00:33:42,935
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

339
00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:45,646
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

340
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:49,483
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

341
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:51,819
An elegant weapon...

342
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,699
for a more civilized age.

343
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,159
For over a thousand generations,
thejedi knights...

344
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,205
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

345
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:06,041
before the dark times...

346
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:10,754
before the Empire.

347
00:34:10,755 --> 00:34:15,175
How did my father die?

348
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,803
A youngjedi named Darth Vader...

349
00:34:17,804 --> 00:34:21,140
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

350
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:26,141
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy thejedi knights.

351
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:30,441
He betrayed and murdered your father.

352
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:33,986
Now thejedi are all but extinct.

353
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:37,823
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

354
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:40,701
The Force?

355
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:43,829
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

356
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,457
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

357
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,126
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

358
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:54,127
It binds the galaxy together.

359
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:02,056
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

360
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:04,224
and where you come from.

361
00:35:04,225 --> 00:35:07,478
- I saw part of a message-
- I seem to have found it.

362
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:11,899
<i>General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

363
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,444
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

364
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:18,656
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.</i>

365
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:20,616
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack...</i>

366
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,993
<i>and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

367
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:26,372
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

368
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,540
<i>into the memory systems of this R2 unit.</i>

369
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:31,168
<i>My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

370
00:35:31,169 --> 00:35:35,172
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

371
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:37,675
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

372
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:42,676
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

373
00:35:55,735 --> 00:35:59,905
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

374
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,448
Alderaan?

375
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:03,409
I'm not going to Alderaan.

376
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,869
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

377
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:08,372
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

378
00:36:08,373 --> 00:36:13,373
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

379
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:20,300
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

380
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:22,219
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

381
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,306
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

382
00:36:26,307 --> 00:36:29,893
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

383
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:33,856
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

384
00:36:33,857 --> 00:36:38,857
Learn about the Force, Luke.

385
00:36:42,741 --> 00:36:45,617
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

386
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:50,247
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

387
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:55,248
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

388
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,511
Until this battle station is fully operational,
we are vulnerable.

389
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,764
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

390
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:08,766
They're more dangerous than you realize.

391
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,769
Dangerous to your starﬂeet, Commander...

392
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,562
not to this battle station.

393
00:37:13,563 --> 00:37:17,274
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate-

394
00:37:17,275 --> 00:37:21,737
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

395
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:25,949
L'vejust received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

396
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:30,287
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

397
00:37:30,288 --> 00:37:31,789
That's impossible.

398
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:34,166
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

399
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:39,167
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

400
00:37:39,422 --> 00:37:43,175
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

401
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:45,385
Fear of this battle station.

402
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:46,637
And what of the rebellion?

403
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:49,973
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

404
00:37:49,974 --> 00:37:52,017
it is possible, however unlikely...

405
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:54,895
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

406
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:58,565
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

407
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:02,945
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

408
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:05,030
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

409
00:38:05,031 --> 00:38:09,409
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

410
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,161
I suggest we use it.

411
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:15,499
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

412
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,002
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

413
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,921
next to the power of the Force.

414
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:24,466
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

415
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:27,219
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

416
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:30,097
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

417
00:38:30,098 --> 00:38:35,098
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress-

418
00:38:41,401 --> 00:38:45,154
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

419
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:47,948
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

420
00:38:47,949 --> 00:38:51,618
As you wish.

421
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,872
This bickering is pointless.

422
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:58,667
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

423
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,420
by the time this station is operational.

424
00:39:01,421 --> 00:39:06,421
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

425
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:16,226
It looks like the Sandpeople did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

426
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:18,645
L'vejust never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

427
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:22,065
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

428
00:39:22,066 --> 00:39:24,067
These tracks are side-by-side.

429
00:39:24,068 --> 00:39:28,322
Sandpeople always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

430
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:31,283
These are the samejawas
that sold us R2 and 3P0.

431
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:36,163
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sandpeople.

432
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:40,167
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

433
00:39:40,168 --> 00:39:45,168
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughterjawas?

434
00:39:48,134 --> 00:39:51,220
If they traced the robots here,
they may have learned who they sold them to...

435
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:53,305
and that would lead them back... home.

436
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:54,681
Wait, Luke.

437
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:59,682
It's too dangerous.

438
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:22,751
Uncle Owen.

439
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,628
Aunt Beru.

440
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:29,629
Uncle Owen.

441
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:21,306
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

442
00:42:04,896 --> 00:42:08,065
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

443
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:10,067
You'd have been killed too...

444
00:42:10,068 --> 00:42:14,571
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

445
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:17,324
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

446
00:42:17,325 --> 00:42:19,409
There's nothing for me here now.

447
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:24,410
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become ajedi like my father.

448
00:42:38,137 --> 00:42:40,555
Mos Eisley spaceport.

449
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:45,556
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

450
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:51,270
We must be cautious.

451
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,148
How long have you had these droids?

452
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:34,401
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

453
00:43:34,402 --> 00:43:37,195
Let me see your identification.

454
00:43:37,196 --> 00:43:40,323
You don't need to see his identification.

455
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:42,242
We don't need to see his identification.

456
00:43:42,243 --> 00:43:44,870
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

457
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:47,998
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

458
00:43:47,999 --> 00:43:50,459
He can go about his business.

459
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,795
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

460
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:58,796
Move along. Move along.

461
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:16,860
I can't abide thosejawas.
Disgusting creatures.

462
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:20,155
Go on, go on.

463
00:44:20,156 --> 00:44:23,492
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.

464
00:44:23,493 --> 00:44:28,493
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

465
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:34,252
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

466
00:44:34,253 --> 00:44:37,297
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

467
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:41,218
Only watch your step-
this place can be a little rough.

468
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:46,219
I'm ready for anything.

469
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:51,891
Come along, R2.

470
00:45:38,776 --> 00:45:42,362
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

471
00:45:42,363 --> 00:45:45,407
Your droids- they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.

472
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:47,951
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

473
00:45:47,952 --> 00:45:52,952
I heartily agree with you, sir.

474
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:04,589
I'll have one of those.

475
00:46:36,292 --> 00:46:41,004
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

476
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:44,633
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

477
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:49,304
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

478
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:52,223
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

479
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:55,352
This little one's not worth the effort.

480
00:46:55,353 --> 00:47:00,353
Come, let me get you something.

481
00:47:24,173 --> 00:47:27,467
I'm all right.

482
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:32,468
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

483
00:47:36,477 --> 00:47:41,477
I don't like the look of this.

484
00:47:53,327 --> 00:47:56,996
<i>Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

485
00:47:56,997 --> 00:48:00,291
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

486
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:02,711
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

487
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:06,589
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium <i>Falcon?</i>

488
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,299
Should I have?

489
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,300
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

490
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:15,849
I've outrun imperial starships.

491
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,934
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

492
00:48:17,935 --> 00:48:21,896
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

493
00:48:21,897 --> 00:48:24,983
She's fast enough for you, old man.

494
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:27,986
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers-

495
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:31,948
myself, the boy, two droids...

496
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:35,118
and no questions asked.

497
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,078
Is it some kind of local trouble?

498
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,079
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

499
00:48:43,711 --> 00:48:46,546
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

500
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:50,300
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

501
00:48:50,301 --> 00:48:53,803
10,000, all in advance.

502
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:56,389
10,000?

503
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:59,058
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

504
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:01,394
But who's gonna ﬂy it, kid? You?

505
00:49:01,395 --> 00:49:03,563
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

506
00:49:03,564 --> 00:49:06,065
We don't have to sit here and listen-

507
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:09,027
We can pay you 2,000 now...

508
00:49:09,028 --> 00:49:13,072
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

509
00:49:13,073 --> 00:49:17,952
Seventeen?

510
00:49:17,953 --> 00:49:20,330
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

511
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:22,916
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

512
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:25,668
Ninety-four.

513
00:49:25,669 --> 00:49:30,669
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

514
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:35,674
All right. We'll check it out.

515
00:49:44,688 --> 00:49:48,233
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

516
00:49:48,234 --> 00:49:52,779
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

517
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,906
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

518
00:49:54,907 --> 00:49:58,034
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

519
00:49:58,035 --> 00:50:00,620
Going somewhere, Solo?

520
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:03,706
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

521
00:50:03,707 --> 00:50:06,042
Telljabba that I've got his money.

522
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:08,044
It's too late.

523
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,547
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

524
00:50:10,548 --> 00:50:12,757
Jabba's put a price on your head so large...

525
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:17,136
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

526
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:19,222
I'm lucky I found you first.

527
00:50:19,223 --> 00:50:21,516
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

528
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:25,186
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

529
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:28,606
I don't have it with me. Telljabba-

530
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:31,192
jabba's through with you.

531
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:33,820
He has no time for smugglers...

532
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:36,573
who drop their shipments
at the first sign of an imperial cruiser.

533
00:50:36,574 --> 00:50:40,410
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

534
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:44,622
You can tell that tojabba.
He may only take your ship.

535
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:46,916
Over my dead body.

536
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,167
That's the idea.

537
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:52,255
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

538
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:57,256
I'll bet you have.

539
00:51:07,646 --> 00:51:12,646
Sorry about the mess.

540
00:51:18,657 --> 00:51:21,784
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

541
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:25,288
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

542
00:51:25,289 --> 00:51:28,958
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

543
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,294
What course shall we set?

544
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:34,797
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

545
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:36,507
What do you mean?

546
00:51:36,508 --> 00:51:39,552
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

547
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:43,222
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

548
00:51:43,223 --> 00:51:47,352
Lock the door, R2.

549
00:51:47,353 --> 00:51:52,353
Check this side of the street.

550
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:58,525
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

551
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:06,454
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke
than stay here with you.

552
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:10,667
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

553
00:52:10,668 --> 00:52:14,295
You watch your language.

554
00:52:14,296 --> 00:52:17,674
All right. Give it to me. <i>I'll</i> take it.

555
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:21,344
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

556
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:26,345
<i>It'll</i> be enough.

557
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,119
Solo! Come out of there, Solo!

558
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,330
Right here,jabba.

559
00:52:49,331 --> 00:52:51,457
I've been waitin' for you.

560
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,043
Have you now.

561
00:52:54,044 --> 00:52:57,588
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

562
00:52:57,589 --> 00:53:02,135
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

563
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:04,303
Why haven't you paid me...

564
00:53:04,304 --> 00:53:07,807
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

565
00:53:07,808 --> 00:53:10,643
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

566
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:12,228
Don't send one of these twerps.

567
00:53:12,229 --> 00:53:15,815
Han, I can't make exceptions.

568
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:18,776
What if everyone who smuggled for me...

569
00:53:18,777 --> 00:53:21,446
dropped their cargo at the first sign...

570
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:24,198
of an imperial starship?

571
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,200
It's not good business.

572
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:30,872
Look,jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

573
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:33,416
You think I had a choice?

574
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:35,293
But I got a nice, easy charter.

575
00:53:35,294 --> 00:53:39,422
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

576
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:44,423
Han, my boy, you're the best.

577
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:47,597
So, for an extra twenty percent...

578
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:49,682
Fifteemjabba. Don't push it.

579
00:53:49,683 --> 00:53:51,851
Okay, fifteen percent.

580
00:53:51,852 --> 00:53:54,103
But if you fail me again...

581
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:57,106
I'll put a price on your head so <i>big...</i>

582
00:53:57,107 --> 00:54:01,444
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

583
00:54:01,445 --> 00:54:05,698
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

584
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:10,699
Come on!

585
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:17,790
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

586
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:42,193
What a piece of junk.

587
00:54:42,194 --> 00:54:44,821
She'll make .5 past light speed.

588
00:54:44,822 --> 00:54:47,698
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

589
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:50,785
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

590
00:54:50,786 --> 00:54:55,786
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

591
00:54:59,294 --> 00:55:04,294
Hello, sir.

592
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:12,974
Which way?

593
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:16,561
All right, men, load your weapons.

594
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:21,562
Stop that ship. Blast them.

595
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:32,410
Chewie, get us out of here!

596
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:37,411
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

597
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:58,060
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

598
00:55:58,061 --> 00:55:59,562
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

599
00:55:59,563 --> 00:56:04,563
while I make the calculations
for thejump to light speed.

600
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,411
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

601
00:56:15,412 --> 00:56:17,580
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

602
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,540
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

603
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:23,044
We'll be safe enough
once we make thejump to hyperspace.

604
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:28,045
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

605
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:31,135
Here's where the fun begins.

606
00:56:31,136 --> 00:56:33,012
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

607
00:56:33,013 --> 00:56:36,015
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

608
00:56:36,016 --> 00:56:37,683
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

609
00:56:37,684 --> 00:56:40,811
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

610
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:43,356
Without precise calculations,
we'd ﬂy right through a star...

611
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:47,068
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

612
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:49,528
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deﬂector shield.

613
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:54,529
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make thejump to light speed.

614
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,806
We've entered the Alderaan system.

615
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:20,851
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

616
00:57:20,852 --> 00:57:25,852
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

617
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:28,734
Charming to the last.

618
00:57:28,735 --> 00:57:30,736
You don't know how hard I found it...

619
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:32,738
signing the order to terminate your life.

620
00:57:32,739 --> 00:57:35,700
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

621
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:38,953
Princess Leia, before your execution...

622
00:57:38,954 --> 00:57:41,247
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

623
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:44,333
that will make
this battle station operational.

624
00:57:44,334 --> 00:57:47,837
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

625
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,089
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

626
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:52,842
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

627
00:57:52,843 --> 00:57:56,262
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

628
00:57:56,263 --> 00:57:59,807
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

629
00:57:59,808 --> 00:58:02,018
that'll be destroyed first.

630
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:06,647
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

631
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:09,525
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

632
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:12,528
on your home planet ofAlderaan.

633
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:15,364
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

634
00:58:15,365 --> 00:58:17,783
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

635
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:21,912
Then name the system.

636
00:58:21,913 --> 00:58:26,167
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

637
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:31,168
Where is the rebel base?

638
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,883
Dantooine.

639
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:35,760
They're on Dantooine.

640
00:58:35,761 --> 00:58:39,221
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

641
00:58:39,222 --> 00:58:42,183
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

642
00:58:42,184 --> 00:58:44,435
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

643
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:46,979
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

644
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:51,980
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

645
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:58,987
Commence primary ignition.

646
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:23,015
Are you all right? What's wrong?

647
00:59:23,016 --> 00:59:25,267
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

648
00:59:25,268 --> 00:59:28,562
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

649
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:31,190
and were suddenly silenced.

650
00:59:31,191 --> 00:59:34,944
I fear something terrible has happened.

651
00:59:34,945 --> 00:59:39,782
You'd better get on with your exercises.

652
00:59:39,783 --> 00:59:42,284
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

653
00:59:42,285 --> 00:59:47,285
I told you I'd outrun them.

654
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,418
Don't everybody thank me at once.

655
00:59:50,419 --> 00:59:55,419
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

656
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:07,389
Now be careful, R2.

657
01:00:13,775 --> 01:00:16,444
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

658
01:00:16,445 --> 01:00:18,696
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wool<iee.

659
01:00:18,697 --> 01:00:21,157
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

660
01:00:21,158 --> 01:00:25,828
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

661
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:29,748
Wookiees are known to do that.

662
01:00:29,749 --> 01:00:31,667
I see your point, sir.

663
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:36,668
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

664
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:58,194
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

665
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:00,613
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

666
01:01:00,614 --> 01:01:05,614
But it also obeys your commands.

667
01:01:07,746 --> 01:01:12,666
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

668
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:15,211
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

669
01:01:15,212 --> 01:01:17,713
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

670
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:19,715
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

671
01:01:19,716 --> 01:01:22,051
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

672
01:01:22,052 --> 01:01:25,513
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

673
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:29,725
There's no mystical energy field
controls my destiny.

674
01:01:29,726 --> 01:01:32,686
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

675
01:01:32,687 --> 01:01:37,274
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

676
01:01:37,275 --> 01:01:41,737
This time, let go your conscious self...

677
01:01:41,738 --> 01:01:45,074
and act on instinct.

678
01:01:45,075 --> 01:01:48,619
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

679
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:53,620
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

680
01:02:00,465 --> 01:02:05,465
Stretch out with your feelings.

681
01:02:17,232 --> 01:02:19,483
You see? You can do it.

682
01:02:19,484 --> 01:02:21,235
I call it luck.

683
01:02:21,236 --> 01:02:23,946
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

684
01:02:23,947 --> 01:02:26,282
Good against remotes is one thing.

685
01:02:26,283 --> 01:02:30,411
Good against the living,
that's something else.

686
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:35,412
We're coming up on Alderaan.

687
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,544
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

688
01:02:38,545 --> 01:02:43,545
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

689
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:49,805
Yes?

690
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:51,890
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

691
01:02:51,891 --> 01:02:53,892
They found the remains of a rebel base...

692
01:02:53,893 --> 01:02:56,353
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

693
01:02:56,354 --> 01:03:00,733
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

694
01:03:00,734 --> 01:03:03,402
She lied. She lied to us.

695
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:08,403
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

696
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:13,450
Terminate her immediately.

697
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,580
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

698
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,213
What the-

699
01:03:23,214 --> 01:03:25,507
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

700
01:03:25,508 --> 01:03:27,009
some kind of asteroid collision.

701
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,428
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

702
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:31,847
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

703
01:03:31,848 --> 01:03:34,183
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

704
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:36,101
It ain't there. it's been blown away.

705
01:03:36,102 --> 01:03:38,896
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

706
01:03:38,897 --> 01:03:41,190
The entire starﬂeet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

707
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:45,319
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've-

708
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,655
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

709
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:50,991
It's an imperial fighter.

710
01:03:50,992 --> 01:03:53,702
- It followed us.
- No. it's a short-range fighter.

711
01:03:53,703 --> 01:03:58,703
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

712
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,960
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

713
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:04,171
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

714
01:04:04,172 --> 01:04:09,172
- Let it go. it's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

715
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:14,723
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

716
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:17,476
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

717
01:04:17,477 --> 01:04:22,477
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

718
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:24,858
He's heading for that small moon.

719
01:04:24,859 --> 01:04:28,904
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

720
01:04:28,905 --> 01:04:31,156
That's no moon.

721
01:04:31,157 --> 01:04:36,157
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

722
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:40,374
I have a very bad feeling about this.

723
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,334
Turn the ship around.

724
01:04:42,335 --> 01:04:44,670
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

725
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:49,671
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

726
01:04:51,428 --> 01:04:55,597
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

727
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:57,641
Why are we still moving towards it?

728
01:04:57,642 --> 01:04:59,560
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

729
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,311
There's gotta be something you can do.

730
01:05:01,312 --> 01:05:04,148
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

731
01:05:04,149 --> 01:05:09,149
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

732
01:05:10,196 --> 01:05:15,196
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

733
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:32,634
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

734
01:05:32,635 --> 01:05:37,635
<i>We are opening the magnetic field.</i>

735
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:54,611
To your stations. Come with me.

736
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,159
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

737
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:02,331
Yes?

738
01:06:02,332 --> 01:06:05,417
<i>We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.</i>

739
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:09,338
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

740
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:13,258
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

741
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:18,259
She may yet be of some use to us.

742
01:06:21,351 --> 01:06:26,351
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.</i>

743
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:34,029
There's no one on board, sir.

744
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,574
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

745
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:40,494
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

746
01:06:40,495 --> 01:06:42,538
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

747
01:06:42,539 --> 01:06:44,498
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

748
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:48,085
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

749
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:49,419
Yes, sir.

750
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,088
I sense something...

751
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:56,089
a presence I've not felt since-

752
01:06:56,261 --> 01:07:01,261
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

753
01:07:08,648 --> 01:07:13,648
There's no one here.

754
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:21,743
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

755
01:07:21,744 --> 01:07:24,955
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

756
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:26,248
This is ridiculous.

757
01:07:26,249 --> 01:07:28,876
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

758
01:07:28,877 --> 01:07:30,294
Leave that to me.

759
01:07:30,295 --> 01:07:33,422
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

760
01:07:33,423 --> 01:07:38,423
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

761
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:51,519
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

762
01:07:51,774 --> 01:07:56,774
All right. Let's go.

763
01:08:07,957 --> 01:08:11,627
Hey, down there.

764
01:08:11,628 --> 01:08:16,628
Could you give us a hand with this?

765
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:25,641
TK-421,why aren't you at your post?

766
01:08:25,642 --> 01:08:30,642
TK-421, do you copy?

767
01:08:39,656 --> 01:08:44,656
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

768
01:09:00,426 --> 01:09:02,928
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

769
01:09:02,929 --> 01:09:05,055
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

770
01:09:05,056 --> 01:09:08,433
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneal<in' around.

771
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:10,310
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

772
01:09:10,311 --> 01:09:15,311
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

773
01:09:24,534 --> 01:09:28,120
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

774
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:31,081
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

775
01:09:31,082 --> 01:09:35,419
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

776
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:40,420
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

777
01:09:41,217 --> 01:09:44,553
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

778
01:09:44,554 --> 01:09:48,056
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

779
01:09:48,057 --> 01:09:52,019
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

780
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,062
They must be delivered safely...

781
01:09:54,063 --> 01:09:57,357
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

782
01:09:57,358 --> 01:10:02,358
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

783
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,324
The Force will be with you...

784
01:10:06,325 --> 01:10:11,325
always.

785
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:19,629
You said it, Chewie.

786
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:23,091
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

787
01:10:23,092 --> 01:10:24,760
Ben is a great man.

788
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:27,804
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

789
01:10:27,805 --> 01:10:30,932
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

790
01:10:30,933 --> 01:10:33,351
Who do you think-

791
01:10:33,352 --> 01:10:36,688
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

792
01:10:36,689 --> 01:10:39,357
He says, “I've found her,”
and keeps repeating, “She's here.”

793
01:10:39,358 --> 01:10:42,069
Who? Who has he found?

794
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,905
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

795
01:10:44,906 --> 01:10:46,698
- Princess?
- Where is she?

796
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:51,699
Princess? What's going on?

797
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:59,040
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

798
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,382
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

799
01:11:04,383 --> 01:11:07,469
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

800
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,013
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

801
01:11:10,014 --> 01:11:12,015
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

802
01:11:12,016 --> 01:11:14,976
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

803
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:18,355
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

804
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:20,899
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

805
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:24,569
You said you didn't want tojust wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

806
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:27,739
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

807
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:32,740
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

808
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:42,254
She's rich.

809
01:11:42,255 --> 01:11:44,339
Rich?

810
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,468
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be-

811
01:11:48,469 --> 01:11:51,346
- What?
- Well, more well than you can imagine.

812
01:11:51,347 --> 01:11:53,431
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

813
01:11:53,432 --> 01:11:55,600
- You'll get it.
- I better.

814
01:11:55,601 --> 01:11:57,185
You will.

815
01:11:57,186 --> 01:11:59,729
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

816
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:02,732
- All right.
- What's your plan?

817
01:12:02,733 --> 01:12:06,778
3P0, hand me those binders there,
will you?

818
01:12:06,779 --> 01:12:08,864
Okay.

819
01:12:08,865 --> 01:12:11,950
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

820
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:16,204
Okay, Han, you put those on.

821
01:12:16,205 --> 01:12:18,790
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

822
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:21,293
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

823
01:12:21,294 --> 01:12:24,629
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

824
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:28,550
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

825
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:33,551
That isn't very reassuring.

826
01:12:50,907 --> 01:12:55,907
<i>517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.</i>

827
01:13:21,938 --> 01:13:26,938
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

828
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,473
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

829
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:03,474
I did say so before.

830
01:14:15,449 --> 01:14:18,743
Where are you taking this... thing?

831
01:14:18,744 --> 01:14:22,831
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

832
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:24,833
I wasn't notified.

833
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:29,834
<i>I'll</i> have to clear it.

834
01:14:33,175 --> 01:14:38,175
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

835
01:15:00,077 --> 01:15:05,077
Look out.

836
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,923
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

837
01:15:13,924 --> 01:15:16,217
Here it is- 2187. You go and get her.

838
01:15:16,218 --> 01:15:21,218
I'll hold them here.

839
01:15:22,141 --> 01:15:24,851
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

840
01:15:24,852 --> 01:15:26,144
<i>What happened?</i>

841
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:28,146
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

842
01:15:28,147 --> 01:15:30,565
but everything's perfectly all right now.

843
01:15:30,566 --> 01:15:33,902
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

844
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:37,572
- <i>How are you?</i>
- <i>We 're sending a squad up.</i>

845
01:15:37,573 --> 01:15:40,825
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

846
01:15:40,826 --> 01:15:44,829
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

847
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:49,830
<i>Who is this? What's your operating number?</i>

848
01:15:49,835 --> 01:15:54,835
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

849
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:10,855
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

850
01:16:10,856 --> 01:16:13,775
Oh, the uniform.

851
01:16:13,776 --> 01:16:15,944
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

852
01:16:15,945 --> 01:16:19,072
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

853
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:21,116
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

854
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:24,202
Come on.

855
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:28,123
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

856
01:16:28,124 --> 01:16:31,584
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

857
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:35,505
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

858
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:38,049
Surely he must be dead by now.

859
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:41,511
Don't underestimate the Force.

860
01:16:41,512 --> 01:16:45,640
Thejedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

861
01:16:45,641 --> 01:16:49,018
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

862
01:16:49,019 --> 01:16:50,311
Yes.

863
01:16:50,312 --> 01:16:54,482
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

864
01:16:54,483 --> 01:16:57,110
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

865
01:16:57,111 --> 01:17:00,905
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

866
01:17:00,906 --> 01:17:03,825
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

867
01:17:03,826 --> 01:17:08,826
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

868
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:21,630
Get behind me. Get behind me.

869
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:34,560
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

870
01:17:35,357 --> 01:17:38,359
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut of four only escape route.

871
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:43,360
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

872
01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:45,700
- <i>C-3 PO. C-3 PO.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir?</i>

873
01:17:45,701 --> 01:17:50,701
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

874
01:17:51,373 --> 01:17:53,708
What was that? I didn't copy.

875
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:57,253
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

876
01:17:57,254 --> 01:17:59,881
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

877
01:17:59,882 --> 01:18:02,217
All other information on your level
is restricted.

878
01:18:02,218 --> 01:18:05,762
Open up in there. Open up in there.

879
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:07,555
Oh, no.

880
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:12,556
There isn't any other way out.

881
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:17,023
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

882
01:18:17,024 --> 01:18:20,652
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

883
01:18:20,653 --> 01:18:22,779
He's the brains, sweetheart.

884
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,657
Well, I didn't-

885
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:30,658
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

886
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:36,330
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

887
01:18:40,673 --> 01:18:42,882
Get in there!

888
01:18:42,883 --> 01:18:46,928
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

889
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:51,432
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

890
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:55,061
Wonderful girl.

891
01:18:55,062 --> 01:18:59,774
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

892
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:04,775
Get in there.

893
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,959
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

894
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:22,960
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

895
01:19:22,965 --> 01:19:25,300
Let's get out of here.

896
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:30,301
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

897
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:36,936
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

898
01:19:36,937 --> 01:19:39,272
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

899
01:19:39,273 --> 01:19:41,316
Absolutely, Your Worship.

900
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:43,735
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

901
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:46,779
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

902
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:51,780
It could be worse.

903
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,995
It's worse.

904
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:57,999
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

905
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,669
Somethingjust moved past my leg.

906
01:20:01,670 --> 01:20:06,670
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

907
01:20:26,362 --> 01:20:31,362
Kid! Luke!

908
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:42,460
Grab hold of this!

909
01:20:42,461 --> 01:20:44,962
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

910
01:20:44,963 --> 01:20:49,963
- Where?
- Anywhere!

911
01:21:20,332 --> 01:21:22,041
Help him!

912
01:21:22,042 --> 01:21:24,127
- What happened?
- I don't know.

913
01:21:24,128 --> 01:21:29,128
It just let go of me and disappeared.

914
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:37,970
I got a bad feeling about this.

915
01:21:41,103 --> 01:21:46,103
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

916
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:58,240
Help me.

917
01:22:07,504 --> 01:22:11,215
Wait a minute.

918
01:22:11,216 --> 01:22:15,470
3P0! Come in, 3P0!

919
01:22:15,471 --> 01:22:17,096
<i>3P0!</i>

920
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:22,097
<i>Where could he be?</i>

921
01:22:23,353 --> 01:22:27,982
Take over. See to him.

922
01:22:27,983 --> 01:22:31,944
Look, there.

923
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:34,363
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

924
01:22:34,364 --> 01:22:36,365
If you hurry, you might catch them.

925
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:41,366
Follow me.

926
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,580
You stand guard.

927
01:22:47,836 --> 01:22:52,836
Come on.

928
01:22:57,471 --> 01:23:00,848
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

929
01:23:00,849 --> 01:23:04,060
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

930
01:23:04,061 --> 01:23:09,061
All right.

931
01:23:17,825 --> 01:23:20,618
3P0. Come in, 3P0.

932
01:23:20,619 --> 01:23:21,994
3P0.

933
01:23:21,995 --> 01:23:24,914
- Get on top.
- I can't.

934
01:23:24,915 --> 01:23:28,209
Where could he be? 3P0.

935
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:30,795
3P0, will you come in?

936
01:23:30,796 --> 01:23:33,130
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

937
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:38,131
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

938
01:23:39,596 --> 01:23:44,596
One things for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

939
01:23:44,893 --> 01:23:49,893
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

940
01:23:52,526 --> 01:23:57,526
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

941
01:23:58,448 --> 01:24:00,908
“Use the comlink”? Oh, my.

942
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:05,909
I forgot. I turned it off.

943
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,126
- Are you there, sir?
- 3P0?

944
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:12,837
- We've <i>had some problems.</i>
- <i>Shut up and I/Sten to me.</i>

945
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:16,674
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?</i>

946
01:24:16,675 --> 01:24:20,803
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

947
01:24:20,804 --> 01:24:23,556
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

948
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:28,557
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

949
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:40,323
What?

950
01:24:40,324 --> 01:24:42,325
You did great, 3P0!

951
01:24:42,326 --> 01:24:44,785
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

952
01:24:44,786 --> 01:24:46,871
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

953
01:24:46,872 --> 01:24:50,249
It's all my fault. My poor master.

954
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,793
We're all right. You did great!

955
01:24:52,794 --> 01:24:56,714
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number- Where are we?

956
01:24:56,715 --> 01:25:01,715
<i>3263827.</i>

957
01:25:45,847 --> 01:25:49,517
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

958
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:52,561
Let's get moving.

959
01:25:52,562 --> 01:25:54,855
Where you goin'?

960
01:25:54,856 --> 01:25:58,359
Wait! They'll hear!

961
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:00,361
Come here, you big coward.

962
01:26:00,362 --> 01:26:02,905
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

963
01:26:02,906 --> 01:26:05,741
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

964
01:26:05,742 --> 01:26:09,495
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

965
01:26:09,496 --> 01:26:12,498
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

966
01:26:12,499 --> 01:26:15,876
I take orders from just one person- me.

967
01:26:15,877 --> 01:26:17,878
It's a wonder you're still alive.

968
01:26:17,879 --> 01:26:21,173
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

969
01:26:21,174 --> 01:26:26,174
No reward is worth this.

970
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:35,688
Give me regular reports, please.

971
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:38,941
Right.

972
01:26:38,942 --> 01:26:43,942
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

973
01:26:47,242 --> 01:26:49,368
You seen that new VT-16?

974
01:26:49,369 --> 01:26:51,912
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

975
01:26:51,913 --> 01:26:53,914
They say it's quite a thing to see.

976
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:56,000
What was that?

977
01:26:56,001 --> 01:27:01,001
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

978
01:27:04,259 --> 01:27:06,385
- There she is.
- C-3 PO, do you copy?

979
01:27:06,386 --> 01:27:07,553
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

980
01:27:07,554 --> 01:27:09,513
- Are <i>you</i> safe?
- <i>For the moment.</i>

981
01:27:09,514 --> 01:27:13,851
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

982
01:27:13,852 --> 01:27:15,561
We're right above you. Stand by.

983
01:27:15,562 --> 01:27:18,439
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

984
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:23,440
Nice. Come on.

985
01:27:23,945 --> 01:27:26,947
It's them. Blast them.

986
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:28,824
Get back to the ship!

987
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:30,868
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

988
01:27:30,869 --> 01:27:35,869
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

989
01:27:59,481 --> 01:28:04,481
I think we took a wrong turn.

990
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:11,446
There's no lock.

991
01:28:11,451 --> 01:28:14,453
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

992
01:28:14,454 --> 01:28:17,706
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

993
01:28:17,707 --> 01:28:22,707
They're coming through.

994
01:28:41,857 --> 01:28:46,857
Here, hold this.

995
01:28:59,708 --> 01:29:04,708
Here they come.

996
01:29:12,304 --> 01:29:17,304
For luck.

997
01:29:19,978 --> 01:29:24,978
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

998
01:29:38,788 --> 01:29:43,788
Where could they be?

999
01:29:44,544 --> 01:29:49,544
Close the blast doors.

1000
01:29:53,595 --> 01:29:58,595
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

1001
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:19,407
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

1002
01:30:19,955 --> 01:30:21,747
The circle is now complete.

1003
01:30:21,748 --> 01:30:24,041
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1004
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:26,502
Now I am the master.

1005
01:30:26,503 --> 01:30:31,503
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1006
01:30:48,817 --> 01:30:51,193
Your powers are weak, old man.

1007
01:30:51,194 --> 01:30:54,947
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1008
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:59,948
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1009
01:31:05,792 --> 01:31:10,792
You should not have come back.

1010
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:37,948
Didn't we just leave this party?

1011
01:31:37,949 --> 01:31:40,284
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1012
01:31:40,285 --> 01:31:42,870
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1013
01:31:42,871 --> 01:31:47,871
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1014
01:31:59,512 --> 01:32:04,433
Look.

1015
01:32:04,434 --> 01:32:08,062
Come on, R2. We're going.

1016
01:32:08,063 --> 01:32:13,063
Now's our chance. Go!

1017
01:32:39,302 --> 01:32:41,553
Come on!

1018
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:43,097
Come on!

1019
01:32:43,098 --> 01:32:48,098
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1020
01:32:55,860 --> 01:33:00,860
<i>Run, Luke, run.</i>

1021
01:33:01,324 --> 01:33:06,324
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

1022
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,361
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1023
01:33:39,362 --> 01:33:44,362
Hold them off. Angle the deﬂector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1024
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:56,958
I can't believe he's gone.

1025
01:33:57,547 --> 01:34:00,174
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1026
01:34:00,175 --> 01:34:05,175
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1027
01:34:19,194 --> 01:34:24,194
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1028
01:34:32,415 --> 01:34:37,415
Here they come.

1029
01:34:51,559 --> 01:34:56,559
They're coming in too fast!

1030
01:35:01,402 --> 01:35:06,402
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1031
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:11,741
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1032
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:32,558
Got him. I got him!

1033
01:35:32,559 --> 01:35:36,144
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1034
01:35:36,145 --> 01:35:41,145
There's still two more.

1035
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:15,601
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1036
01:36:15,602 --> 01:36:20,602
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1037
01:36:25,903 --> 01:36:27,654
Are they away?

1038
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:30,699
They've just made thejump
into hyperspace.

1039
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:35,329
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1040
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:37,789
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1041
01:36:37,790 --> 01:36:39,916
This had better work.

1042
01:36:39,917 --> 01:36:42,753
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1043
01:36:42,754 --> 01:36:45,922
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1044
01:36:45,923 --> 01:36:48,342
That doesn't sound too hard.

1045
01:36:48,343 --> 01:36:52,095
They let us go. it's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1046
01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:54,973
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1047
01:36:54,974 --> 01:36:58,018
Not this ship, sister.

1048
01:36:58,019 --> 01:37:00,646
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1049
01:37:00,647 --> 01:37:03,190
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1050
01:37:03,191 --> 01:37:06,401
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1051
01:37:06,402 --> 01:37:09,780
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1052
01:37:09,781 --> 01:37:13,241
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1053
01:37:13,242 --> 01:37:16,703
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1054
01:37:16,704 --> 01:37:19,665
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1055
01:37:19,666 --> 01:37:21,958
You needn't worry about your reward.

1056
01:37:21,959 --> 01:37:26,959
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1057
01:37:28,049 --> 01:37:30,050
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1058
01:37:30,051 --> 01:37:34,388
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1059
01:37:34,389 --> 01:37:39,389
I care.

1060
01:37:42,522 --> 01:37:44,231
So...

1061
01:37:44,232 --> 01:37:46,233
what do you think of her, Han?

1062
01:37:46,234 --> 01:37:48,944
I'm trying not to, kid.

1063
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:53,615
Good.

1064
01:37:53,616 --> 01:37:58,616
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1065
01:37:58,663 --> 01:38:01,832
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me-

1066
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:06,833
No.

1067
01:38:50,089 --> 01:38:53,383
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1068
01:38:53,384 --> 01:38:55,385
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1069
01:38:55,386 --> 01:38:58,472
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1070
01:38:58,473 --> 01:39:03,473
It's our only hope.

1071
01:39:21,579 --> 01:39:24,372
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>We 're approaching the planet Ya v/n.</i>

1072
01:39:24,373 --> 01:39:26,792
<i>The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.</i>

1073
01:39:26,793 --> 01:39:31,793
<i>We are preparing to orbit the planet.</i>

1074
01:39:37,804 --> 01:39:39,971
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1075
01:39:39,972 --> 01:39:44,142
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starﬂeet.

1076
01:39:44,143 --> 01:39:48,313
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1077
01:39:48,314 --> 01:39:53,314
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1078
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:59,199
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1079
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,870
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1080
01:40:03,871 --> 01:40:06,706
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1081
01:40:06,707 --> 01:40:10,085
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1082
01:40:10,086 --> 01:40:14,005
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1083
01:40:14,006 --> 01:40:16,049
The approach will not be easy.

1084
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:19,302
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1085
01:40:19,303 --> 01:40:22,764
and skim the surface to this point.

1086
01:40:22,765 --> 01:40:25,559
The target area is only two meters wide.

1087
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,480
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1088
01:40:30,481 --> 01:40:33,775
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1089
01:40:33,776 --> 01:40:36,611
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1090
01:40:36,612 --> 01:40:38,905
which should destroy the station.

1091
01:40:38,906 --> 01:40:42,534
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1092
01:40:42,535 --> 01:40:45,787
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1093
01:40:45,788 --> 01:40:48,039
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1094
01:40:48,040 --> 01:40:51,918
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1095
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:54,421
They're not much bigger than two meters.

1096
01:40:54,422 --> 01:40:59,422
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1097
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:09,102
<i>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.</i>

1098
01:41:09,103 --> 01:41:12,898
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

1099
01:41:12,899 --> 01:41:15,609
This will be a day long remembered.

1100
01:41:15,610 --> 01:41:17,694
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1101
01:41:17,695 --> 01:41:22,695
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1102
01:41:26,037 --> 01:41:31,037
<i>All ﬂight crews, man your stations.</i>

1103
01:41:34,754 --> 01:41:37,964
So, you got your reward
and you'rejust leaving, then?

1104
01:41:37,965 --> 01:41:41,051
That's right. Yeah.

1105
01:41:41,052 --> 01:41:43,762
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1106
01:41:43,763 --> 01:41:47,933
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1107
01:41:47,934 --> 01:41:51,645
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1108
01:41:51,646 --> 01:41:54,731
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1109
01:41:54,732 --> 01:41:57,484
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1110
01:41:57,485 --> 01:42:00,362
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1111
01:42:00,363 --> 01:42:02,864
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1112
01:42:02,865 --> 01:42:05,909
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1113
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:10,205
It's more like... suicide.

1114
01:42:10,206 --> 01:42:13,541
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1115
01:42:13,542 --> 01:42:16,294
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1116
01:42:16,295 --> 01:42:20,966
Hey, Luke.

1117
01:42:20,967 --> 01:42:25,967
May the Force be with you.

1118
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:34,850
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1119
01:42:37,483 --> 01:42:42,483
<i>All pilots to your stations.</i>

1120
01:42:48,869 --> 01:42:51,204
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1121
01:42:51,205 --> 01:42:53,790
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1122
01:42:53,791 --> 01:42:58,336
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1123
01:42:58,337 --> 01:43:03,337
I only wish Ben were here.

1124
01:43:08,806 --> 01:43:11,808
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1125
01:43:11,809 --> 01:43:13,810
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1126
01:43:13,811 --> 01:43:15,562
Hey, Luke!

1127
01:43:15,563 --> 01:43:18,857
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1128
01:43:18,858 --> 01:43:21,026
- Corning up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1129
01:43:21,027 --> 01:43:25,030
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1130
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:27,032
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1131
01:43:27,033 --> 01:43:31,161
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1132
01:43:31,162 --> 01:43:33,747
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1133
01:43:33,748 --> 01:43:37,751
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1134
01:43:37,752 --> 01:43:40,587
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1135
01:43:40,588 --> 01:43:45,588
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1136
01:43:46,469 --> 01:43:49,471
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1137
01:43:49,472 --> 01:43:52,724
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1138
01:43:52,725 --> 01:43:55,393
You okay, R2?

1139
01:43:55,394 --> 01:43:57,854
Good.

1140
01:43:57,855 --> 01:44:01,274
<i>Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1141
01:44:01,275 --> 01:44:06,154
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1142
01:44:06,155 --> 01:44:11,155
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1143
01:44:56,497 --> 01:45:01,497
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1144
01:45:11,554 --> 01:45:15,140
<i>Standby alert. Death Star approaching.</i>

1145
01:45:15,141 --> 01:45:20,141
<i>Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.</i>

1146
01:45:31,407 --> 01:45:33,741
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1147
01:45:33,742 --> 01:45:36,077
- <i>Red Seven standing b y.</i>
- <i>Red</i> Three <i>standing by.</i>

1148
01:45:36,078 --> 01:45:38,913
- <i>Red Six standing by.</i>
- <i>Red Nine standing by.</i>

1149
01:45:38,914 --> 01:45:41,040
- Red Two standing by.
- Red <i>I I</i> standing by.

1150
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:44,335
Red Five standing by.

1151
01:45:44,336 --> 01:45:49,336
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1152
01:45:50,509 --> 01:45:52,594
<i>We're passing through the magnetic field.</i>

1153
01:45:52,595 --> 01:45:55,471
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1154
01:45:55,472 --> 01:45:59,934
<i>Double front.</i>

1155
01:45:59,935 --> 01:46:01,811
Look at the size of that thing.

1156
01:46:01,812 --> 01:46:06,812
<i>Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.</i>

1157
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:10,653
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1158
01:46:10,654 --> 01:46:13,615
- I copy, <i>Gold Leader.
-</i> We're starting for the target shaft.

1159
01:46:13,616 --> 01:46:18,616
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1160
01:46:31,508 --> 01:46:36,508
- <i>Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.</i>
- <i>lsee it. Stay/om.</i>

1161
01:46:42,228 --> 01:46:47,228
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1162
01:46:48,317 --> 01:46:51,236
<i>Luke, pull up!</i>

1163
01:46:51,237 --> 01:46:56,237
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1164
01:46:59,286 --> 01:47:03,289
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1165
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:05,291
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1166
01:47:05,292 --> 01:47:09,963
Get the crews to their fighters.

1167
01:47:09,964 --> 01:47:13,925
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

1168
01:47:13,926 --> 01:47:15,301
I'm on it.

1169
01:47:15,302 --> 01:47:20,302
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1170
01:47:25,104 --> 01:47:26,980
I've got a problem here.

1171
01:47:26,981 --> 01:47:28,481
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1172
01:47:28,482 --> 01:47:33,482
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right-

1173
01:47:34,822 --> 01:47:39,822
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1174
01:47:41,662 --> 01:47:46,662
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1175
01:47:52,172 --> 01:47:53,881
Squad leaders...

1176
01:47:53,882 --> 01:47:56,009
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1177
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,052
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1178
01:47:58,053 --> 01:47:59,846
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1179
01:47:59,847 --> 01:48:04,847
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- <i>Here</i> they <i>come.</i>

1180
01:48:05,311 --> 01:48:10,311
You've got one on your tail.

1181
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:14,694
I'm hit!

1182
01:48:14,695 --> 01:48:19,240
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1183
01:48:19,241 --> 01:48:22,660
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1184
01:48:22,661 --> 01:48:27,661
I'll be right there.

1185
01:48:36,884 --> 01:48:41,884
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1186
01:48:43,766 --> 01:48:46,976
<i>- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.</i>

1187
01:48:46,977 --> 01:48:51,977
<i>Fighters above you, coming in.</i>

1188
01:48:55,569 --> 01:48:58,404
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1189
01:48:58,405 --> 01:49:00,656
<i>Hang on back there.</i>

1190
01:49:00,657 --> 01:49:03,409
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1191
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,912
<i>There '5 a hea vy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1192
01:49:05,913 --> 01:49:10,913
I can't shake him.

1193
01:49:11,377 --> 01:49:16,130
I'm on him, Luke.

1194
01:49:16,131 --> 01:49:21,131
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1195
01:49:24,765 --> 01:49:27,642
<i>- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1196
01:49:27,643 --> 01:49:32,605
<i>Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.</i>

1197
01:49:32,606 --> 01:49:37,402
<i>I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.</i>

1198
01:49:37,403 --> 01:49:39,779
Stay in attack formation.

1199
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:44,780
<i>The exhaust port is marked and locked in.</i>

1200
01:49:48,497 --> 01:49:51,749
<i>Switch all power
to front deﬂector screen.</i>

1201
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:56,750
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1202
01:49:59,675 --> 01:50:01,509
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1203
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:04,846
<i>Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.</i>

1204
01:50:04,847 --> 01:50:09,809
<i>Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.</i>

1205
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:14,810
Switch to targeting computer.

1206
01:50:15,315 --> 01:50:19,652
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1207
01:50:19,653 --> 01:50:23,531
The guns. They've stopped.

1208
01:50:23,532 --> 01:50:26,159
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1209
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:30,621
<i>They're coming in. Three marks at 210.</i>

1210
01:50:30,622 --> 01:50:32,874
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1211
01:50:32,875 --> 01:50:37,875
Yes, sir.

1212
01:50:48,682 --> 01:50:51,225
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1213
01:50:51,226 --> 01:50:54,896
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1214
01:50:54,897 --> 01:50:58,858
Loosen up!

1215
01:50:58,859 --> 01:51:01,819
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1216
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:06,820
- I COPY, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1217
01:51:10,537 --> 01:51:13,247
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1218
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:15,249
Should I have your ship standing by?

1219
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:18,211
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1220
01:51:18,212 --> 01:51:21,380
I think you overestimate their chances.

1221
01:51:21,381 --> 01:51:24,175
<i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>

1222
01:51:24,176 --> 01:51:26,135
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1223
01:51:26,136 --> 01:51:27,929
<i>Rendezvous at mark 6.1.</i>

1224
01:51:27,930 --> 01:51:31,557
- <i>This 13 Red Two ﬂying to ward yo u.</i>
- <i>Red Three standing by.</i>

1225
01:51:31,558 --> 01:51:33,601
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1226
01:51:33,602 --> 01:51:36,354
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1227
01:51:36,355 --> 01:51:39,065
<i>Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.</i>

1228
01:51:39,066 --> 01:51:44,066
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1229
01:51:50,869 --> 01:51:55,869
This is it.

1230
01:51:56,625 --> 01:52:00,419
We should be able to see it by now.

1231
01:52:00,420 --> 01:52:03,965
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1232
01:52:03,966 --> 01:52:06,467
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1233
01:52:06,468 --> 01:52:11,013
- No sign of any- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1234
01:52:11,014 --> 01:52:13,391
I'm in range.

1235
01:52:13,392 --> 01:52:17,687
Target's coming up.

1236
01:52:17,688 --> 01:52:20,648
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1237
01:52:20,649 --> 01:52:23,609
Close up formation.

1238
01:52:23,610 --> 01:52:28,610
Almost there.

1239
01:52:34,871 --> 01:52:39,500
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1240
01:52:39,501 --> 01:52:44,501
I can't hold them.

1241
01:52:49,386 --> 01:52:54,386
It's away!

1242
01:52:54,641 --> 01:52:56,350
<i>- It's a hit!
- Negative.</i>

1243
01:52:56,351 --> 01:52:58,519
Negative. It didn't go in.

1244
01:52:58,520 --> 01:53:03,520
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1245
01:53:07,654 --> 01:53:09,405
<i>Red Leader, we're right above you.</i>

1246
01:53:09,406 --> 01:53:11,657
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1247
01:53:11,658 --> 01:53:15,411
<i>Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.</i>

1248
01:53:15,412 --> 01:53:20,412
<i>Get set up for your attack run.</i>

1249
01:53:31,011 --> 01:53:34,347
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1250
01:53:34,348 --> 01:53:36,015
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.</i>

1251
01:53:36,016 --> 01:53:39,477
<i>We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.</i>

1252
01:53:39,478 --> 01:53:41,687
Right with you, boss.

1253
01:53:41,688 --> 01:53:44,065
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1254
01:53:44,066 --> 01:53:49,066
It'll bejust like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1255
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:55,743
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1256
01:53:55,744 --> 01:53:58,412
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.</i>

1257
01:53:58,413 --> 01:54:03,376
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1258
01:54:03,377 --> 01:54:05,461
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1259
01:54:05,462 --> 01:54:06,837
What about that tower?

1260
01:54:06,838 --> 01:54:11,838
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1261
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:20,681
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1262
01:54:28,443 --> 01:54:33,443
<i>Fighters coming in .3.</i>

1263
01:54:39,162 --> 01:54:41,747
- <i>I'm hit. I can 'z' stay with you.</i>
- <i>Get clear, Wedge.</i>

1264
01:54:41,748 --> 01:54:45,292
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1265
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:50,214
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1266
01:54:50,215 --> 01:54:55,215
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1267
01:54:56,596 --> 01:55:01,596
R2, try and increase the power.

1268
01:55:04,688 --> 01:55:06,856
<i>Hurry up, Luke. Quick.</i>

1269
01:55:06,857 --> 01:55:11,857
Quick.

1270
01:55:15,031 --> 01:55:17,658
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1271
01:55:17,659 --> 01:55:22,246
I'm on the leader.

1272
01:55:22,247 --> 01:55:27,247
Hang on, R2.

1273
01:55:39,139 --> 01:55:44,139
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1274
01:55:44,352 --> 01:55:48,439
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1275
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:50,900
The Force is strong with this one.

1276
01:55:50,901 --> 01:55:55,901
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1277
01:55:58,033 --> 01:55:59,950
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1278
01:55:59,951 --> 01:56:02,161
<i>You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?</i>

1279
01:56:02,162 --> 01:56:07,162
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1280
01:56:17,761 --> 01:56:20,846
<i>I've lost R2.</i>

1281
01:56:20,847 --> 01:56:23,057
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1282
01:56:23,058 --> 01:56:26,435
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1283
01:56:26,436 --> 01:56:28,145
<i>Rebel base in range.</i>

1284
01:56:28,146 --> 01:56:30,773
You may fire when ready.

1285
01:56:30,774 --> 01:56:35,774
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1286
01:56:46,206 --> 01:56:50,084
I have you now.

1287
01:56:50,085 --> 01:56:53,879
What?

1288
01:56:53,880 --> 01:56:58,880
Look out.

1289
01:57:01,555 --> 01:57:06,555
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1290
01:57:11,231 --> 01:57:15,568
<i>Stand by.</i>

1291
01:57:15,569 --> 01:57:20,569
<i>Stand by.</i>

1292
01:57:27,747 --> 01:57:31,083
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1293
01:57:31,084 --> 01:57:36,084
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1294
01:58:00,947 --> 01:58:02,907
I just knew you'd come back.

1295
01:58:02,908 --> 01:58:05,534
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1296
01:58:05,535 --> 01:58:08,162
I knew there was more to you than money.

1297
01:58:08,163 --> 01:58:09,538
Oh, no.

1298
01:58:09,539 --> 01:58:12,666
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1299
01:58:12,667 --> 01:58:15,628
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1300
01:58:15,629 --> 01:58:18,964
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1301
01:58:18,965 --> 01:58:21,967
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1302
01:58:21,968 --> 01:58:26,968
He'll be all right.

1
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,938
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,483
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,819
the one crawling with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,446
Oh, I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,665
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,042
Mark my position. Form
your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,044
We're on your tail, General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:34,088
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,021
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,148
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,793
They're all over me. Get them off my...

12
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,837
- I'm gonna go help them out.
- No.

13
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,673
No, they are doing their
job so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,190
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,194
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,368
All right, R4.

17
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,037
No, no, no, no... No, nothing too fancy.

18
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:55,002
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

19
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,389
We got 'em, R2.

20
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,732
Flying is for droids.

21
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,743
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,378
R4, be careful. You have a-

23
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,425
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,387
They're shutting down all the controls.

25
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,515
- Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.

26
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,477
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

27
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,651
Oh! In the name of...

28
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:06,949
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

29
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,125
I can't see a thing. My cockpit's fogging.

30
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,297
They're all over me. Anakin!

31
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:28,012
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

32
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,475
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

33
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I'm not leaving without you, Master.

34
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:46,572
Get him, R2.

35
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,034
Watch out.

36
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,957
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

37
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,509
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

38
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,721
The general's command ship is dead ahead.

39
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,892
Well, have you noticed the
shields are still up?

40
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,019
Sorry, Master.

41
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,654
Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

42
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,629
There they are. Get them.

43
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:57,142
R2, locate the chancellor.

44
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,237
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there...

45
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,407
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

46
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,409
I sense Count Dooku.

47
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:16,829
I sense a trap.
Next move?

48
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,499
Spring the trap.

49
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,794
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

50
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,796
Here. Take this and wait for orders.

51
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,606
What's the situation, Captain?

52
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,651
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

53
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:52,031
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

54
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,286
Destroyers.

55
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,297
Drop your weapons. I said drop 'em.

56
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,924
Roger.
Roger, roger.

57
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,216
Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,768
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,399
Did you press the stop button?
No. Did you?

60
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,778
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

61
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,696
We don't want to get out.

62
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:38,494
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,788
Come in, R2.
What that?

64
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,790
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:44,792
R2, activate the elevator number...

66
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,127
31174.

67
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,172
Get back to work. That nothin'.

68
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,217
Activate the elevator 31174.

69
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,219
R2, we...

70
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,935
Always on the move.

71
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,937
R2, switch on the comlink.

72
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,064
R2, can you hear me?

73
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,608
R2?

74
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,985
Whoa!

75
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,195
R2! R2!

76
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,035
Stop. Stop. R2, we need to be going up.

77
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,373
Hands up, Jedi.

78
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,667
R2, do you copy?

79
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,754
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

80
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,595
Hey, you!

81
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,684
Now, that's better.

82
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,063
You stupid little astro droid.

83
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,275
Uh-oh.

84
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,117
Oh, it's you.

85
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,079
My eyes! My eyes!

86
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,623
What was that all about?
Well, R2 has been...

87
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,668
Uh, no loose wire jokes.
Did I say anything?

88
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,754
He's trying.
I didn't say anything.

89
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,293
Chancellor.
Are you all right?

90
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:54,004
Count Dooku.

91
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:01,470
This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.

92
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,607
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

93
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,778
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

94
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,781
Your swords, please.

95
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:24,368
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

96
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,703
You won't get away this time, Dooku.

97
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,633
I've been looking forward to this.

98
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,928
My powers have doubled
since the last time we met, Count.

99
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,515
Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

100
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,578
Get-

101
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:37,900
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

102
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,653
You have hate. You have anger.

103
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,697
But you don't use them.

104
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:07,095
Good, Anakin. Good.

105
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,223
Kill him.

106
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,267
Kill him now.

107
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,816
I shouldn't.

108
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,779
Do it.

109
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,710
You did well, Anakin.

110
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,756
He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

111
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,259
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

112
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,220
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

113
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:53,475
It is only natural. He cut off
your arm, and you wanted revenge.

114
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,603
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

115
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,482
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

116
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,863
Now we must leave
before more security droids arrive.

117
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,246
Anakin, there's no time.

118
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,582
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

119
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,712
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

120
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,506
His fate will be the same as ours.

121
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,138
Prepare for attack!

122
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,350
All batteries, fire! Fire!

123
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,321
Elevator's not working.

124
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,702
R2, activate elevator 3224.

125
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,640
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

126
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,079
Magnetize! Magnetize!

127
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,963
Fire the emergency booster engines.

128
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,887
We're leveling out, sir.

129
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,476
Oh!

130
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,780
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

131
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,533
Did I miss something?
Hold on.

132
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,827
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

133
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,912
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

134
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,956
Too late. Jump!

135
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,181
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

136
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,392
R2, get down here.

137
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,769
R2, do you copy?

138
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,401
General, we found the Jedi.

139
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,989
They're in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.

140
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,243
Ray shields.

141
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,203
Wait a minute. How did this happen?

142
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,706
We're smarter than this.
Apparently not.

143
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,878
I say patience.
Patience?

144
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:11,256
Yes. R2 will be along in a few moments,

145
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,634
and then... he'll release the ray shields.

146
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,477
See? No problem.

147
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,731
Don't move.

148
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,691
Ow!

149
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,653
Do you have a plan "B"?

150
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,914
Ah, yes. The negotiator.

151
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,251
General Kenobi. We've been waiting for you.

152
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,504
Excuse me.

153
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,381
That wasn't much of a rescue.
You're welcome.

154
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,926
And...

155
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,803
Anakin Skywalker.

156
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:04,643
I was expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little... older.

157
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:11,024
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

158
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:15,654
Jedi scum.

159
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,532
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

160
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:27,999
Your lightsabers will make a fine addition
to my collection.

161
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,795
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

162
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,130
R2.

163
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,595
Crush them!

164
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,764
Make them suffer!

165
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,478
Come. Now!

166
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,772
Stay at your stations!
Whoa!

167
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,948
Get him! Get him!

168
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,286
Ow!

169
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,176
Run!

170
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,267
Don't bother with them. Keep
the ship in orbit. Yes, sir.

171
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,989
You lose, General Kenobi.

172
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,890
Get out of here! Run!

173
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,530
Time to abandon ship.

174
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:32,165
All the escape pods
have been launched.

175
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,293
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

176
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,463
You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing? Well?

177
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,133
Well, under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

178
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,426
Strap yourselves in.

179
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,056
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

180
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:06,950
We lost something.

181
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,536
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

182
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,793
Now we're really picking up speed.

183
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,178
Eight plus 60.

184
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,391
We're in the atmosphere.
Grab that. Keep us level.

185
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,657
Steady.

186
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,410
Easy, R2.

187
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:57,292
5000. Fire ships on the left and the right.

188
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,128
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

189
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:06,301
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

190
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,375
Another happy landing.

191
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,576
- Are you coming, Master?
- Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

192
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,578
I have to report to the council.

193
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,122
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

194
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:22,085
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

195
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,296
Let us not forget, Anakin,
that you rescued me from the buzz droids.

196
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:27,841
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor,

197
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,843
carrying me unconscious on your back.

198
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:32,470
All because of your training.

199
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,099
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero,

200
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,269
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

201
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:43,439
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

202
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:47,777
Ninth time. That business on Cato Neimoidia
doesn't... doesn't count.

203
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,779
I'll see you at the briefing.

204
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,662
Chancellor Palpatine, are you all right?

205
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,665
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

206
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:05,461
They killed Count Dooku, but General
Grievous has escaped once again.

207
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,090
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

208
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:13,511
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

209
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:19,350
And I assure you, the senate will vote to
continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

210
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:23,521
Then the Jedi Council will make finding
Grievous our highest priority.

211
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,858
Watch it.
Excuse me.

212
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:29,986
Come along, R2.
The Republic cannot praise you enough.

213
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,155
Thank you, Senator Organa.

214
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:35,825
Well, it couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

215
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,911
Now there I agree with you.

216
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,372
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

217
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:46,628
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

218
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,172
Well, I will do everything
I can in the senate.

219
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,591
Excuse me.
Certainly.

220
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,145
Oh, Anakin.

221
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,900
I've missed you, Padmé.

222
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,321
There were whispers that you'd been killed.

223
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,990
I'm all right.

224
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,077
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

225
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,996
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

226
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:25,333
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

227
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,211
Wait. Not here.
Yes, here.

228
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,798
I'm... I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

229
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,175
Anakin, don't say things like that.

230
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:46,604
Are you all right? You're trembling.

231
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,856
What's going on?

232
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,152
Something wonderful has happened.

233
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,366
Ani, I'm pregnant.

234
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,247
That's...

235
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,963
Well, that's won... That's wonderful.

236
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,718
What are we gonna do?

237
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,597
We're not gonna worry about anything
right now. All right?

238
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,183
This is a happy moment.

239
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,479
The happiest moment of my life.

240
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,465
Yes, Lord Sidious?

241
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,467
General Grievous,

242
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:44,680
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

243
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:48,643
It will be done, my lord.

244
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:53,022
The end of the war is near, General.

245
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:56,734
But the loss of Count Dooku-

246
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:01,155
His death was a necessary loss.

247
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,409
Soon I will have a new apprentice-

248
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:10,790
one far younger and more powerful.

249
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,820
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

250
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,282
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know,

251
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,284
where we can be safe.

252
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,830
I can go early and fix up the baby's room.

253
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:58,129
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

254
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:05,720
You are so... beautiful.

255
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,348
It's only because I'm so in love.

256
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,893
No.

257
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,146
No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

258
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,858
So love has blinded you?

259
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,695
Well, that's not exactly what I meant.

260
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,324
But it's probably true.

261
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:37,460
Anakin, help me!

262
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,608
What's bothering you?

263
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,029
Nothing.

264
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,284
I remember when I gave this to you.

265
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:55,621
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

266
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,084
It was a dream.

267
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,336
Bad?

268
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,880
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother,

269
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,882
just before she died.

270
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,884
And?

271
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:13,681
And it was about you.

272
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,185
Tell me.

273
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,856
It was only a dream.

274
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,746
You die in childbirth.

275
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,623
And the baby?

276
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,084
I don't know.

277
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,463
It was only a dream.

278
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,382
I won't let this one become real.

279
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:52,136
This baby will change our lives.

280
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,139
I doubt the queen will continue to allow me
to serve in the senate.

281
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,975
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-

282
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,603
I... I know. I know.

283
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,398
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

284
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,444
We don't need his help.

285
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,782
Our baby is a blessing.

286
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:33,135
Premonitions? Premonitions. Hmm.

287
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,389
These visions you have-

288
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:40,101
They're of pain, suffering.

289
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,938
Death.

290
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:48,442
Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

291
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,946
Someone.

292
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,948
Close to you?

293
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,368
Yes.

294
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:01,330
Careful you must be
when sensing the future, Anakin.

295
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:05,751
The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.

296
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,257
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

297
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,552
Death is a natural part of life.

298
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:19,348
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

299
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:22,726
Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not.

300
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,938
Attachment leads to jealousy.

301
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,483
The shadow of greed that is.

302
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:32,403
What must I do, Master Yoda?

303
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,573
Train yourself to let go...

304
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:39,118
of everything you fear to lose.

305
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,256
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

306
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:56,051
I'm sorry. I was held up.

307
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:59,763
I have no excuse.
In short, they are going very well.

308
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:05,269
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

309
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,396
What's wrong, then?

310
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,107
The senate is expected...

311
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,694
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

312
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,157
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

313
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,701
It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.

314
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,747
Be careful of your friend Palpatine.

315
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:28,250
Be careful of what?

316
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,003
He has requested your presence.
What for?

317
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,758
He would not say.
He didn't inform the council?

318
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:39,345
That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual.

319
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,889
And it's making me feel uneasy.

320
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,781
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

321
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,033
Of course.

322
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,078
I need your help, son.

323
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,206
What do you mean?

324
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:12,545
I'm depending on you.
For what? I don't understand.

325
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:18,217
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

326
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,469
Anakin,

327
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:24,723
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

328
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:28,102
Me? A master?

329
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,605
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

330
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:36,610
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

331
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:40,197
I think they will. They need you.

332
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,741
More than you know.

333
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,215
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

334
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,760
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

335
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,513
I understand.

336
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:09,685
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

337
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,812
What?

338
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,279
How can you do this? This is outrageous.

339
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,531
It's unfair.

340
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,161
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

341
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,789
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

342
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,128
Forgive me, Master.

343
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:42,134
We have surveyed all
systems in the Republic,

344
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:45,971
but have found no sign of General Grievous.

345
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,849
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

346
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,061
The outlying systems you must sweep.

347
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:54,396
We do not have many ships to spare.

348
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,690
What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?

349
00:37:56,775 --> 00:38:00,486
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

350
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,031
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

351
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,451
Go I will.

352
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,579
Good relations with the Wookiees I have.

353
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:15,000
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

354
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,419
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

355
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,588
May the Force be with us all.

356
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,468
What kind of nonsense is this?

357
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,970
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

358
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,807
It's never been done
in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting.

359
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,810
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

360
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:36,939
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

361
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,442
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

362
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:44,279
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

363
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:50,160
I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on
the council. But it's what you wanted.

364
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,580
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

365
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,582
That has nothing to do with this.

366
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,627
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

367
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:01,672
is because the chancellor trusts you.

368
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,800
And?
Anakin, I am on your side.

369
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:08,262
I didn't want to put you in this situation.
What situation?

370
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:16,687
The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.

371
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,148
They want to know what he's up to.

372
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,488
They want me to spy on the chancellor?

373
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,283
But that's treason.
We are at war, Anakin.

374
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,246
Why didn't the council give me this
assignment when we were in session?

375
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,790
This assignment is not to be on record.

376
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:40,836
The chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

377
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,964
He befriended me. He's watched out for me
ever since I arrived here.

378
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,175
That is why you must help us.

379
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,762
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader,

380
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:53,557
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

381
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,642
The senate demanded that he stay longer.

382
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:58,896
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

383
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,567
You're asking me
to do something against the Jedi code,

384
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,404
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

385
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

386
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,537
The council is asking you.

387
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:27,257
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

388
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,552
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

389
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,971
I don't think the boy can handle it.

390
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,599
I don't trust him.

391
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:39,561
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

392
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:43,357
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

393
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,318
So the prophecy says.

394
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:51,323
A prophecy that misread could have been.

395
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,035
He will not let me down.

396
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,079
He never has.

397
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,207
I hope right you are.

398
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:28,902
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

399
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,072
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

400
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:37,119
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

401
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,705
What do you mean?

402
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:44,418
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists,

403
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,130
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

404
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,257
I don't believe that.

405
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,467
And you're sounding like a separatist.

406
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,389
This war represents a failure to listen.

407
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,516
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

408
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,895
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

409
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,564
Don't ask me to do that.

410
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,777
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

411
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,697
- What is it?
- Nothing.

412
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,869
Don't do this.
Don't shut me out. Let me help you.

413
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:23,290
Hold me.

414
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,543
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

415
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:30,422
So long ago,
when there was nothing but our love.

416
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,967
No politics, no plotting, no war.

417
00:43:13,174 --> 00:43:16,551
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

418
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:19,262
I have good news.

419
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:24,726
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

420
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,728
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

421
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,730
At last.

422
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,318
We'll be able to capture that monster
and end this war.

423
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:36,780
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

424
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,282
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

425
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,744
You're the best choice, by far.

426
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:47,165
Hmm. Sit down.

427
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:49,167
Leave us.

428
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,056
Anakin,

429
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:07,602
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

430
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,567
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

431
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,777
I'm not sure I understand.

432
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,573
You must sense what I have come to suspect.

433
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,076
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

434
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:26,913
They're planning to betray me.

435
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,458
I don't think that-
Anakin.

436
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,586
Search your feelings.

437
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,340
You know, don't you?

438
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:44,848
I know they don't trust you.
Hmm. Or the senate.

439
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:49,770
Or the Republic, or
democracy, for that matter.

440
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:54,900
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

441
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,985
Why?

442
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,572
They asked you to do something...

443
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,949
that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

444
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,830
They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

445
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,879
I don't, uh-

446
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,881
I don't know what to say.

447
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:21,551
Remember back to your early teachings.

448
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:25,931
All who gain power are afraid to lose it.

449
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,727
Even the Jedi.
The Jedi use their power for good.

450
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:32,979
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

451
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:38,276
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way,

452
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,073
including their quest for greater power.

453
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,619
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

454
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,497
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

455
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,917
And the Jedi don't?

456
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:58,588
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

457
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,770
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

458
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:20,443
No.
I thought not.

459
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,946
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.

460
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:26,741
It's a Sith legend.

461
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,743
Darth Plagueis...

462
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:34,499
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise,

463
00:46:34,584 --> 00:46:39,462
he could use the Force
to influence the midi-chlorians...

464
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,757
to create... life.

465
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:47,470
He had such a knowledge of the dark side,

466
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,601
he could even keep the
ones he cared about...

467
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,603
from dying.

468
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,736
He could actually...
save people from death?

469
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:08,116
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway to many abilities...

470
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:12,454
some consider to be unnatural.

471
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,415
Wh... What happened to him?

472
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,585
He became so powerful,

473
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,839
the only thing he was afraid of was...

474
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,841
losing his power.

475
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:28,386
Which eventually, of course, he did.

476
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:34,351
Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice
everything he knew.

477
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:38,146
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

478
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,192
It's ironic.

479
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,319
He could save others from death,

480
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,530
but not himself.

481
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:54,246
Is it possible to learn this power?

482
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,210
Not from a Jedi.

483
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,979
All Red units, over here!

484
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:33,868
Palpatine thinks General
Grievous is on Utapau?

485
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:36,997
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

486
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:40,250
from the chairman of Utapau.
Hmm.

487
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,086
Act on this we must.

488
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,924
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

489
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,886
Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

490
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:57,017
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

491
00:48:57,101 --> 00:49:00,437
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go,

492
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,522
not the chancellor.

493
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:07,569
A master is needed, with more experience.

494
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:12,157
I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

495
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,617
- I agree.
- Aye.

496
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:16,578
Aye.

497
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:20,457
Very well. Council adjourned.

498
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:29,215
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

499
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:34,846
Then now the time is, Commander.
Yes, sir.

500
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,027
Charge!

501
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,877
Head for cover!

502
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,312
You're gonna need me on this one, Master.
Oh, I agree.

503
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:28,566
However, it may turn out just to
be a wild Bantha chase. Master.

504
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:35,824
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

505
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:40,328
I've been arrogant, and I apologize.

506
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:42,789
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

507
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:49,838
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

508
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,549
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

509
00:50:52,633 --> 00:50:54,759
I have taught you everything I know.

510
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:58,596
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

511
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:01,391
But be patient, Anakin.

512
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:05,478
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

513
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,114
Obi-Wan. May the Force be with you.

514
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:19,117
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

515
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:46,227
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

516
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,398
On the far side. I'll keep them
distracted until you get there.

517
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,943
Just don't take too long. Come on.
When have I ever let you down?

518
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:55,945
Very well.

519
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,533
The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.

520
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,061
Save your energy.

521
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,188
I can't.

522
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,065
Don't give up, Padmé.

523
00:52:45,538 --> 00:52:47,997
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

524
00:52:48,082 --> 00:52:50,166
He came by this morning.

525
00:52:51,544 --> 00:52:53,461
What did he want?

526
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,505
He's worried about you.

527
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:01,928
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

528
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,806
I feel lost.

529
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,102
Lost? What do you mean?

530
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,356
Obi-Wan and the council don't trust me.

531
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,901
They trust you with their lives.

532
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,697
Something's happening.

533
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:23,449
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

534
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:27,745
I want more.

535
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,873
And I know I shouldn't.

536
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,961
You expect too much of yourself.

537
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,135
I found a way to save you.
Save me?

538
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,178
From my nightmares.

539
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,222
Is that what's bothering you?

540
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,892
I won't lose you, Padmé.

541
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,061
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

542
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,647
I promise you.
No, I promise you.

543
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,985
Greetings, young Jedi.

544
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,530
What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

545
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,574
Unfortunately, the war.

546
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:51,245
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

547
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,540
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

548
00:54:54,625 --> 00:55:00,463
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

549
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,808
He is here. We are being held hostage.

550
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:14,852
They are watching us.
I understand.

551
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:19,774
Tenth level, thousands of battle droids.

552
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,318
Tell your people to take shelter.

553
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:25,405
If you have warriors, now is the time.

554
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,503
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

555
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:46,592
Is he bringing additional warriors?
He didn't say.

556
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:34,140
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

557
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:41,981
I am sending you to
the Mustafar system in the outer rim.

558
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,783
It is a volcanic planet.

559
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:55,203
You will be safe there.
Safe?

560
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:59,290
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

561
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,836
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

562
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:06,881
Be thankful, Viceroy,

563
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:09,884
you have not found yourself in my grip.

564
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,849
Your ship is waiting.

565
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,159
Hello there.

566
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:42,375
General Kenobi.

567
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:45,002
You are a bold one.

568
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:48,548
Kill him.

569
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,482
Back away.

570
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:10,528
I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

571
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,822
Your move.

572
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,824
You fool.

573
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:20,580
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

574
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,589
Attack, Kenobi.

575
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,231
Go, go, go, go! Move it! Move it!

576
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:31,317
Everybody out.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

577
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,319
Cover yourself. Come on.

578
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,452
Move it! Move it!

579
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,830
Come on, move!
Come on, everybody!

580
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,250
Army or not,

581
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:53,464
you must realize you are doomed.

582
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,549
Oh, I don't think so.

583
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:27,248
Uh-oh.

584
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,380
Hyah!

585
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,317
Cover that corner.

586
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:03,826
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

587
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,704
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous,

588
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,081
and we have begun our attack.

589
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,584
Thank you, Commander.

590
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,837
Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.

591
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,506
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

592
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:19,759
Yes, Master.

593
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:29,810
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

594
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,521
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

595
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:36,984
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction of Grievous,

596
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,653
then he should be removed from office.

597
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:43,407
The Jedi Council
would have to take control of the senate...

598
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,659
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

599
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:50,206
To a dark place
this line of thought will carry us.

600
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:55,961
Hmm. Great care we must take.

601
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:04,178
Chancellor.

602
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,806
We've just received
a report from Master Kenobi.

603
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,558
He has engaged General Grievous.

604
01:02:09,643 --> 01:02:13,020
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

605
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,857
I should be there with him.

606
01:02:16,942 --> 01:02:19,318
It's upsetting to me to
see that the council...

607
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:22,696
doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.

608
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:26,909
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

609
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,579
I wish I knew.

610
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,416
More and more I get the feeling that...

611
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,752
I'm being excluded from the council.

612
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:47,680
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

613
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,309
They don't trust you, Anakin.

614
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:55,104
They see your future.

615
01:02:55,188 --> 01:03:00,151
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

616
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:06,031
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

617
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:11,453
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

618
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,331
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

619
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:19,128
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

620
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:22,214
Even the nature of the dark side.

621
01:03:24,176 --> 01:03:26,510
You know the dark side?

622
01:03:26,595 --> 01:03:29,054
Anakin,

623
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,474
if one is to understand the great mystery,

624
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,144
one must study all its aspects,

625
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,189
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

626
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:42,109
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader,

627
01:03:42,194 --> 01:03:45,863
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

628
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,574
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

629
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,868
Only through me...

630
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:54,830
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

631
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:58,250
Learn to know the dark side of the Force,

632
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:02,004
and you will be able to save your wife...

633
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,173
from certain death.

634
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,176
What did you say?

635
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,930
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

636
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,808
You're the Sith lord.

637
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:18,771
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

638
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:23,442
Don't continue to be a
pawn of the Jedi Council.

639
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:29,031
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

640
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:31,700
greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.

641
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:34,203
A life of significance,

642
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:36,664
of conscience.

643
01:04:40,794 --> 01:04:45,089
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

644
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,550
I know you would.

645
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:52,471
I can feel your anger.

646
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,266
It gives you focus,

647
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,726
makes you stronger.

648
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:08,112
I'm going to turn you over to the
Jedi Council. Of course. You should.

649
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:11,240
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

650
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,910
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

651
01:05:14,995 --> 01:05:17,413
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

652
01:05:17,497 --> 01:05:21,166
Know the power of the dark side.

653
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:24,044
Power to save Padmé.

654
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,715
So uncivilized.

655
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,267
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

656
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,438
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

657
01:07:47,522 --> 01:07:51,483
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

658
01:07:51,568 --> 01:07:55,320
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

659
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,532
I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.

660
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:00,576
A Sith lord?

661
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,495
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

662
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,583
How do you know this?
He knows the ways of the Force.

663
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,793
He's been trained to use the dark side.

664
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,754
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

665
01:08:14,174 --> 01:08:16,425
Then our worst fears have been realized.

666
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:20,012
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

667
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,556
Master, the chancellor is very powerful.

668
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,933
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

669
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,978
For you own good, stay out of this affair.

670
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,856
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

671
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:33,066
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

672
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,402
I must go, Master.
No.

673
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:39,364
If what you've told me is true,

674
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,366
you will have gained my trust.

675
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,036
But for now, remain here.

676
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:48,040
Wait in the council
chambers until we return.

677
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:51,585
Yes, Master.

678
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,951
You do know, don't you,

679
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:26,411
if the Jedi destroy me,

680
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:30,499
any chance of saving her will be lost.

681
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:03,842
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

682
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,220
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

683
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:10,932
In the name of the Galactic Senate
of the Republic,

684
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:12,976
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

685
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:15,687
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

686
01:11:15,772 --> 01:11:17,731
The senate will decide your fate.

687
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:21,693
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

688
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:29,368
It's treason then.

689
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:11,887
You are under arrest, my lord.

690
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:15,557
Anakin, I told you it would come to this.

691
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,309
I was right.

692
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,561
The Jedi are taking over.

693
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,147
The oppression of the
Sith will never return.

694
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,483
You have lost.

695
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,568
No.

696
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:30,280
No. No. You will die!

697
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,910
He's a traitor!

698
01:13:34,994 --> 01:13:38,330
He is the traitor!

699
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:44,544
I have the power to save the one you love.

700
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:47,464
You must choose.

701
01:13:48,508 --> 01:13:51,134
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

702
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,846
Don't let him kill me.

703
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,685
I can't hold it any longer.

704
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,022
I... I... I... I can't. I... I... I'm weak.

705
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,149
I'm... I'm too weak.

706
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:07,734
Anakin.

707
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:10,320
Help me. Help me!

708
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:16,993
I... I... I can't hold on any longer.

709
01:14:17,078 --> 01:14:20,247
I am going to end this once and for all.

710
01:14:20,331 --> 01:14:22,290
You can't.

711
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,334
He must stand trial.

712
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:27,838
He has control of the
senate and the courts.

713
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,173
He's too dangerous to be left alive.

714
01:14:30,258 --> 01:14:34,261
I'm too weak. Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

715
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,263
It's not the Jedi way.

716
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,889
He must live.

717
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,143
Please don't.

718
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,562
I need him.

719
01:14:44,564 --> 01:14:46,857
- Please don't!
- No!

720
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:55,615
Power!

721
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:05,959
Unlimited power!

722
01:15:16,387 --> 01:15:19,097
What have I done?

723
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:31,443
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

724
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:35,280
Become my apprentice.

725
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:40,827
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

726
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:46,458
I will do whatever you ask.

727
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,087
Good.

728
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:55,383
Just help me save Padmé's life.

729
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:59,721
I can't live without her.

730
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:07,771
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved,

731
01:16:07,855 --> 01:16:11,566
but if we work together...

732
01:16:11,651 --> 01:16:15,487
I know we can discover the secret.

733
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:19,240
I pledge myself...

734
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:23,662
to your teachings.

735
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:28,458
Good.

736
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,179
The Force is strong with you.

737
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:46,851
A powerful Sith you will become.

738
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:51,231
Henceforth you shall be known as...

739
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,649
Darth...

740
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,568
Vader.

741
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:03,201
Thank you, my master.

742
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:07,372
Rise.

743
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:25,473
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice,

744
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:31,813
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

745
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,859
When the Jedi learn what
has transpired here,

746
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,944
they will kill us,

747
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,655
along with all the senators.

748
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:42,741
I agree.

749
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,453
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

750
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:49,539
Every single Jedi,

751
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:52,917
including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi,

752
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,588
is now an enemy of the Republic.

753
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,591
I understand, Master.

754
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,302
We must move quickly.

755
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,345
The Jedi are relentless.

756
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:10,268
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

757
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:15,940
First I want you to go to the Jedi temple.

758
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,944
We will catch them off-balance.

759
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,990
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

760
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:28,078
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

761
01:18:28,162 --> 01:18:32,957
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

762
01:18:33,042 --> 01:18:35,460
to save Padmé.

763
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:40,048
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

764
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:43,259
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

765
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:48,431
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple,

766
01:18:48,516 --> 01:18:51,226
go to the Mustafar system.

767
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,604
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

768
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,149
and the other separatist leaders.

769
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:04,155
Once more the Sith will rule the galaxy!

770
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:07,283
And...

771
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:12,163
we shall have... peace.

772
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:58,334
Sergeant, over here!

773
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,503
Hurry! Follow them!

774
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,049
All Red units, let's move it!

775
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,051
Come on. Let's go!

776
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,942
Commander, contact your troops.

777
01:20:23,027 --> 01:20:24,986
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

778
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:26,988
Very good, sir.

779
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,240
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

780
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:32,911
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

781
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:34,913
Hyah!
Yes, sir.

782
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,755
Commander Cody,

783
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:47,175
the time has come.

784
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:51,512
Execute order 66.

785
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,598
Yes, my lord.

786
01:20:58,062 --> 01:20:59,437
Blast him!

787
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:27,799
Come on!

788
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:22,395
Execute order 66.

789
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,147
It will be done, my lord.

790
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,233
It will be done, my lord.

791
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,189
Master Skywalker, there
are too many of them.

792
01:23:48,273 --> 01:23:50,274
What are we going to do?

793
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,914
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

794
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,126
Don't worry. I... I'm
sure he'll be all right.

795
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:40,408
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

796
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,077
Don't worry. The situation
is under control.

797
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:46,456
I'm sorry, sir. It's time for you to leave.

798
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,126
And so it is.

799
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:56,466
Get him!

800
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:09,020
No!

801
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,193
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

802
01:25:42,054 --> 01:25:45,014
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

803
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,099
Yes, sir.

804
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,609
Good-bye, Tarfful.

805
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,653
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

806
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,407
Miss you I will.

807
01:26:40,404 --> 01:26:42,697
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

808
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,199
before they walk into this catastrophe.

809
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:52,790
Did you find Kenobi?

810
01:26:52,874 --> 01:26:54,875
Sir, no one could have survived that fall.

811
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,296
Start loading your men on the ships.

812
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:01,173
Move it.

813
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,207
Emergency code 913.

814
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:37,209
I have no contact on any frequency.

815
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,339
Master Kenobi.

816
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,466
Repeat.
Master Kenobi.

817
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,470
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

818
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:50,181
We have just rescued Master Yoda.

819
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,600
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

820
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,852
We're sending you our coordinates.

821
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:04,487
Hush! Not so loud.

822
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:07,573
Are you all right? I heard there
was an attack on the Jedi temple.

823
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:10,159
You could see the smoke from here.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

824
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,829
I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
What's happening?

825
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,791
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

826
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,460
I can't believe that.

827
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:24,131
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

828
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:27,718
Oh, Anakin. What are you gonna do?

829
01:28:36,395 --> 01:28:38,604
I will not betray the Republic.

830
01:28:40,565 --> 01:28:42,566
My loyalties lie with the chancellor...

831
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:46,404
and with the senate and with you.

832
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,698
What about Obi-Wan?

833
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:51,033
I don't know.

834
01:28:51,118 --> 01:28:53,244
Many Jedi have been killed.

835
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:57,164
We can only hope that he's remained
loyal to the chancellor.

836
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,625
Anakin, I'm afraid.

837
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:04,672
Have faith, my love.

838
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:07,091
Everything will soon be set right.

839
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,594
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

840
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,889
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

841
01:29:13,974 --> 01:29:16,517
I'm going there to end this war.

842
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,519
Wait for me until I return.

843
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:21,021
Things will be different. I promise.

844
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,821
Please, wait for me.

845
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,619
Well, he is under a lot of stress, R2.

846
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:39,790
Take care, my little friend.

847
01:29:44,045 --> 01:29:47,757
Oh, my lady, is there anything I might do?

848
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:50,384
No, thank you, 3 PO.

849
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:55,222
Oh. I... I feel so helpless.

850
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,415
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

851
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:24,835
Heard from no one have we.

852
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,047
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

853
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,049
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

854
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:32,718
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

855
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:35,679
Received a coded retreat message we have.

856
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:39,767
It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.

857
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:43,354
It says the war is over.
Well, then we must go back.

858
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:46,941
If there are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

859
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:51,904
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

860
01:30:51,988 --> 01:30:54,740
Yes, Master. There is too much at stake.

861
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:57,409
I agree.

862
01:30:57,494 --> 01:31:01,121
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

863
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:25,521
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

864
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:28,399
You have done well, Viceroy.

865
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:34,321
When my new apprentice Darth Vader arrives,

866
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:37,950
he will take care of you.

867
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:52,631
We're receiving a message
from the chancellor's office, sir.

868
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:54,758
Send it through.
Yes, sir.

869
01:31:56,469 --> 01:32:01,181
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

870
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:03,267
at a special session of Congress.

871
01:32:03,351 --> 01:32:06,937
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

872
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,193
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

873
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:16,405
The chancellor will not be able to control
the thousands of star systems...

874
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,449
without keeping the senate intact.

875
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:22,578
If a special session of Congress there is,

876
01:32:22,662 --> 01:32:26,332
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

877
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:06,455
R2, stay with the ship.

878
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:34,900
Welcome, Lord Vader. We've
been expecting you.

879
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:11,228
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

880
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,647
What's happened?
The chancellor's been elaborating...

881
01:34:13,732 --> 01:34:17,067
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

882
01:34:17,152 --> 01:34:22,656
The remaining Jedi
will be hunted down and defeated.

883
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:40,924
Not even the younglings survived.

884
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:43,969
Killed not by clones...

885
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:47,306
this Padawan.

886
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,060
By a lightsaber he was.

887
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:01,487
Who? Who could have done this?

888
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:15,375
The attempt on my life...

889
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:18,128
has left me scarred...

890
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,215
and deformed.

891
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:24,218
But I assure you.

892
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:29,056
My resolve has never been stronger!

893
01:35:33,228 --> 01:35:37,106
Stop! No!

894
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:50,410
In order to ensure the security...

895
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:53,080
and continuing stability,

896
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:57,084
the Republic will be reorganized...

897
01:35:57,168 --> 01:36:02,631
into the first Galactic Empire!

898
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:04,758
For a safe...

899
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:09,429
and secure society.

900
01:36:18,815 --> 01:36:21,525
So this is how liberty dies.

901
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:24,361
With thunderous applause.

902
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:28,949
The war is over.

903
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:33,162
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

904
01:36:41,296 --> 01:36:46,008
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

905
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,552
For the clones...

906
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,764
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

907
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,154
Wait. Master.

908
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:10,449
There is something I must know.

909
01:37:16,539 --> 01:37:18,999
If into the security recordings you go,

910
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,001
only pain will you find.

911
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:24,588
I must know the truth, Master.

912
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:35,390
It can't be.

913
01:37:35,475 --> 01:37:39,561
You have done well, my new apprentice.

914
01:37:39,646 --> 01:37:42,689
Now, Lord Vader,

915
01:37:42,774 --> 01:37:46,318
go and bring peace to the Empire.

916
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,570
I can't watch any more.

917
01:37:48,655 --> 01:37:53,283
Destroy the Sith we must.

918
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,162
Send me to kill the emperor.

919
01:37:57,247 --> 01:37:59,539
I will not kill Anakin.

920
01:37:59,624 --> 01:38:04,378
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

921
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,714
He is like my brother. I cannot do it.

922
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:13,553
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

923
01:38:13,638 --> 01:38:17,057
The boy you trained, gone he is.

924
01:38:17,141 --> 01:38:20,060
Consumed by Darth Vader.

925
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:23,188
I do not know where the
emperor has sent him.

926
01:38:23,273 --> 01:38:25,524
I don't know where to look.

927
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:30,529
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

928
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,625
When was the last time you saw him?

929
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:47,170
Yesterday.
And do you know where he is now?

930
01:38:48,214 --> 01:38:50,215
No.

931
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,885
Padmé, I need your help.

932
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:57,014
He is in grave danger.
From the Sith?

933
01:38:57,098 --> 01:38:59,099
From himself.

934
01:39:01,519 --> 01:39:03,603
Padmé,

935
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,106
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

936
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:09,693
You're wrong. How could you even say that?

937
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:16,283
I have seen a... a security hologram...

938
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:18,827
of him...

939
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,829
killing younglings.

940
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:23,957
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

941
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:27,044
He was deceived by a lie. We all were.

942
01:39:27,128 --> 01:39:31,673
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

943
01:39:33,468 --> 01:39:36,219
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

944
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:40,432
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

945
01:39:46,606 --> 01:39:48,607
I don't believe you.

946
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:51,985
I can't.

947
01:39:57,075 --> 01:39:58,241
Padmé,

948
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,953
I must find him.

949
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:06,416
You're going to kill him, aren't you?

950
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:12,589
He has become a very great threat.

951
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:17,177
I can't.

952
01:40:30,358 --> 01:40:32,317
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

953
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,281
I'm so sorry.

954
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:25,996
Milady, let me come with you.

955
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:29,040
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

956
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:31,543
As you wish, milady, but
I strongly disagree.

957
01:41:31,627 --> 01:41:35,297
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

958
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:37,799
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

959
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,636
Oh, dear.

960
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,357
Do you know?

961
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:58,069
I think I'm beginning to get the hang
of this flying business. Hmm.

962
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,892
The separatists
have been taken care of, my master.

963
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:31,895
It is finished then.

964
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:39,110
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

965
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:44,115
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

966
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,371
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

967
01:42:49,455 --> 01:42:51,581
Very good, my lord.

968
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,602
I saw your ship.

969
01:43:56,397 --> 01:43:59,441
What are you doing out here?
I was so worried about you.

970
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,737
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

971
01:44:03,821 --> 01:44:05,989
What things?

972
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:09,034
He said you've turned to the dark side.

973
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:11,536
That you...

974
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:13,788
killed younglings.

975
01:44:15,291 --> 01:44:17,959
Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

976
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:21,880
He cares about us.
Us?

977
01:44:21,964 --> 01:44:24,716
He knows.

978
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:26,718
He wants to help you.

979
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:33,808
Anakin, all I want is your love.

980
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:36,227
Love won't save you, Padmé.

981
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:39,606
Only my new powers can do that.
At what cost?

982
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:42,108
You're a good person. Don't do this.

983
01:44:42,193 --> 01:44:44,944
I won't lose you the way I lost my mother.

984
01:44:45,029 --> 01:44:49,282
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

985
01:44:49,367 --> 01:44:52,202
And I'm doing it for you. To protect you.

986
01:44:53,996 --> 01:44:55,455
Come away with me.

987
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:58,208
Help me raise our child.

988
01:44:58,334 --> 01:45:02,587
Leave everything else behind while
we still can. Don't you see?

989
01:45:02,672 --> 01:45:05,924
We don't have to run away anymore.

990
01:45:06,008 --> 01:45:08,551
I have brought peace to the Republic.

991
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,513
I am more powerful than the chancellor.

992
01:45:11,597 --> 01:45:13,723
I... I can overthrow him.

993
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,853
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy,

994
01:45:18,938 --> 01:45:21,398
make things the way we want them to be.

995
01:45:27,697 --> 01:45:29,739
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

996
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,536
Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

997
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,582
I don't want to hear any
more about Obi-Wan.

998
01:45:39,667 --> 01:45:43,878
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

999
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:47,590
I don't know you anymore.

1000
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:51,177
Anakin,

1001
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,847
you're breaking my heart.

1002
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,933
You're going down a path I can't follow.

1003
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:59,811
Because of Obi-Wan?

1004
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:02,689
Because of what you've done.

1005
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:04,733
What you plan to do.

1006
01:46:05,943 --> 01:46:08,611
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

1007
01:46:08,696 --> 01:46:11,656
I love you.
Liar!

1008
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,369
No.

1009
01:46:16,454 --> 01:46:20,206
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

1010
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:23,293
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

1011
01:46:24,795 --> 01:46:26,379
Anakin.

1012
01:46:26,464 --> 01:46:28,673
Let her go.

1013
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:40,685
You turned her against me!

1014
01:46:42,271 --> 01:46:44,481
You have done that yourself.

1015
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:51,404
You will not take her from me!

1016
01:46:51,489 --> 01:46:55,366
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

1017
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:03,666
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now...

1018
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:08,421
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

1019
01:47:08,506 --> 01:47:10,423
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

1020
01:47:10,508 --> 01:47:13,051
I see through the lies of the Jedi.

1021
01:47:14,136 --> 01:47:16,554
I do not fear the dark side as you do.

1022
01:47:18,349 --> 01:47:20,308
I have brought peace,

1023
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:22,101
freedom, justice...

1024
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,064
and security to my new empire.

1025
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:29,025
Your new empire?

1026
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:32,445
Don't make me kill you.

1027
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:37,075
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

1028
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,786
If you're not with me,

1029
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:42,705
then you're my enemy.

1030
01:47:44,708 --> 01:47:47,210
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

1031
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,256
I will do what I must.

1032
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:54,717
You will try.

1033
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:30,503
I hear a new apprentice you have, Emperor.

1034
01:48:30,588 --> 01:48:35,091
Or should I call you Darth Sidious?

1035
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,427
Master Yoda.

1036
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,596
You survived.

1037
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,432
Surprised?

1038
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:47,145
Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda.

1039
01:48:47,229 --> 01:48:49,314
Now you will experience...

1040
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:53,902
the full power of the dark side.

1041
01:49:35,819 --> 01:49:39,530
I have waited a long time...

1042
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:42,200
for this moment,

1043
01:49:42,284 --> 01:49:46,829
my little green friend.

1044
01:49:55,839 --> 01:50:00,510
At last the Jedi are no more.

1045
01:50:00,594 --> 01:50:04,847
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1046
01:50:09,436 --> 01:50:12,522
At an end your rule is.

1047
01:50:14,358 --> 01:50:16,818
And not short enough it was.

1048
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:23,825
If so powerful you are,

1049
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,327
why leave?

1050
01:50:27,454 --> 01:50:30,039
You will not stop me.

1051
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:34,752
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1052
01:50:34,837 --> 01:50:39,215
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1053
01:50:40,509 --> 01:50:44,595
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1054
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:14,949
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1055
01:55:15,033 --> 01:55:17,868
Activate your homing
beacon when you're ready.

1056
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:20,329
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1057
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:24,083
Then he is not dead.
Double your search.

1058
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:26,419
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1059
01:55:26,503 --> 01:55:31,590
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

1060
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:36,846
Yes, Master.
I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1061
01:56:45,624 --> 01:56:49,418
Into exile I must go.

1062
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,629
Failed I have.

1063
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:32,980
I have failed you, Anakin.

1064
01:58:33,064 --> 01:58:34,982
I have failed you.

1065
01:58:35,066 --> 01:58:37,985
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1066
01:58:38,069 --> 01:58:40,905
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1067
01:58:40,989 --> 01:58:43,657
From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

1068
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:45,367
Well, then you are lost!

1069
01:58:57,214 --> 01:58:59,757
This is the end for you, my master.

1070
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:28,410
It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

1071
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:32,748
You underestimate my power.

1072
01:59:34,084 --> 01:59:35,251
Don't try it.

1073
01:59:58,191 --> 02:00:00,109
You were the chosen one!

1074
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,030
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

1075
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:09,493
Bring balance to the Force,

1076
02:00:09,578 --> 02:00:12,121
not leave it in darkness!

1077
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,842
I hate you!

1078
02:00:32,809 --> 02:00:34,977
You were my brother, Anakin.

1079
02:00:36,980 --> 02:00:39,356
I loved you.

1080
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:21,190
Oh. Master Kenobi.

1081
02:01:21,274 --> 02:01:23,567
Um, we have Miss Padmé on board.

1082
02:01:23,652 --> 02:01:26,195
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1083
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:28,489
We should leave this dreadful place.

1084
02:01:40,502 --> 02:01:42,503
Obi-Wan.

1085
02:01:44,005 --> 02:01:46,215
Is Anakin all right?

1086
02:02:54,784 --> 02:02:57,619
Your Majesty, this way.

1087
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,621
There he is.

1088
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,915
He's still alive.

1089
02:03:04,878 --> 02:03:07,129
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1090
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:09,214
Yes, sir. Right away.

1091
02:03:45,502 --> 02:03:47,127
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1092
02:03:53,009 --> 02:03:55,219
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1093
02:04:12,028 --> 02:04:14,488
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1094
02:04:44,018 --> 02:04:47,020
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1095
02:04:47,105 --> 02:04:50,357
For reasons we can't
explain, we are losing her.

1096
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,444
She's dying?
We don't know why.

1097
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,613
She has lost the will to live.

1098
02:04:56,698 --> 02:04:59,867
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1099
02:04:59,951 --> 02:05:01,577
Babies?

1100
02:05:01,661 --> 02:05:03,579
She's carrying twins.

1101
02:05:43,161 --> 02:05:45,621
Ee-see-tah oy-doh.

1102
02:05:45,705 --> 02:05:48,498
Luke.

1103
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:58,967
Oh, Luke.

1104
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:06,725
Ooh-bah, ooh-bah.

1105
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:10,270
Ooh-bah.

1106
02:06:16,277 --> 02:06:19,196
Ee-see-tah oy-dah.

1107
02:06:19,322 --> 02:06:22,282
It's a girl.
Leia.

1108
02:07:04,242 --> 02:07:05,659
Obi-Wan?

1109
02:07:11,124 --> 02:07:13,041
There's good in him.

1110
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:17,671
I know.

1111
02:07:17,755 --> 02:07:20,382
I know there's...

1112
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:22,467
still-

1113
02:07:56,627 --> 02:07:59,337
Lord Vader.

1114
02:07:59,422 --> 02:08:01,548
Can you hear me?

1115
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:07,095
Yes, Master.

1116
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:12,017
Where is Padmé?

1117
02:08:12,101 --> 02:08:14,811
Is she safe?

1118
02:08:15,897 --> 02:08:17,939
Is she all right?

1119
02:08:19,609 --> 02:08:24,196
It seems, in your anger, you killed her.

1120
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:28,116
I? I couldn't have.

1121
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,244
She was alive. I felt it!

1122
02:08:50,973 --> 02:08:55,310
No!

1123
02:09:05,154 --> 02:09:08,949
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1124
02:09:10,576 --> 02:09:14,162
We must take them somewhere where the
Sith will not sense their presence.

1125
02:09:15,248 --> 02:09:19,209
Hmm. Split up they should be.

1126
02:09:19,293 --> 02:09:21,461
My wife and I will take the girl.

1127
02:09:23,005 --> 02:09:26,341
We've always talked of
adopting a baby girl.

1128
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,301
She will be loved with us.

1129
02:09:29,554 --> 02:09:31,179
And what of the boy?

1130
02:09:32,181 --> 02:09:35,642
To Tatooine. To his family send him.

1131
02:09:37,436 --> 02:09:39,896
I will take the child and watch over him.

1132
02:09:45,361 --> 02:09:49,030
Until the time is right, disappear we will.

1133
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:54,452
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1134
02:09:55,955 --> 02:10:01,209
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1135
02:10:02,587 --> 02:10:03,837
Training?

1136
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:08,550
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1137
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:13,680
One who has returned
from the netherworld of the Force.

1138
02:10:13,764 --> 02:10:16,308
Your old master.

1139
02:10:16,392 --> 02:10:18,393
Qui-Gon?

1140
02:10:20,897 --> 02:10:24,191
How to commune with him I will teach you.

1141
02:10:25,651 --> 02:10:27,819
Captain Antilles.
Yes, Your Highness?

1142
02:10:27,904 --> 02:10:29,821
I'm placing these droids in your care.

1143
02:10:29,906 --> 02:10:31,823
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1144
02:10:31,908 --> 02:10:33,783
Have the protocol droid's mind wiped.

1145
02:10:33,910 --> 02:10:35,410
What?

1146
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:39,247
Oh, no.

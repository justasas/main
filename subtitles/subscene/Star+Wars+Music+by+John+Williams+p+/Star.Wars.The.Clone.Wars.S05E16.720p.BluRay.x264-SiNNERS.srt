1
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:23,641
<i>Neutral star systems in peril.</i>

2
00:00:23,709 --> 00:00:27,411
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress
command the planet Mandalore</i>

3
00:00:27,479 --> 00:00:29,614
<i>through the puppet Prime Minister Almec</i>

4
00:00:29,682 --> 00:00:32,616
<i>while they expand
their criminal enterprise.</i>

5
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:35,052
<i>With the Death Watch removed from power</i>

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,521
<i>and the Jedi unaware
of the villainous plot,</i>

7
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,257
<i>nothing stands in the way
of Darth Maul's vision</i>

8
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,592
<i>for a vast criminal empire.</i>

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,062
<i>We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned</i>

10
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,063
<i>as her few remaining loyal subjects</i>

11
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:50,100
<i>make a desperate attempt to rescue her.</i>

12
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,801
What do you want, you traitor?

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,972
We'll never betray you, Auntie Satine.

14
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,140
I'm here to rescue you.

15
00:00:57,207 --> 00:00:58,908
Korkie.

16
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:01,644
Freeze!

17
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:03,746
Hold it there.

18
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:07,417
Death Watch.

19
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,222
Bo.

20
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:14,357
It's been a long time.

21
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,491
It's okay, Auntie.

22
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,293
She's on our side now.

23
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,595
Why are you helping now?

24
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:23,533
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,336
There was a time
when we weren't enemies.

26
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:29,806
Perhaps that time has come again.

27
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,108
Come on.

28
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:32,276
Let's go.

29
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:41,118
It's all clear.
Come on.

30
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:46,924
We need to contact the Jedi Council.

31
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:48,726
Korkie, give me your comlink.

32
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,995
It won't be any good
unless we get outside the city.

33
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,764
All of the frequencies are jammed.

34
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:56,033
You are all taking
a terrible risk by helping me.

35
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:57,802
Nothing we haven't done before.

36
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,970
Right, Auntie?

37
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,705
Let's get going.

38
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:35,477
Take 'em out.

39
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,454
Get the duchess clear.

40
00:03:21,262 --> 00:03:23,396
The transmission is still blocked.

41
00:03:32,274 --> 00:03:33,374
You're clear.

42
00:03:34,643 --> 00:03:36,744
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

43
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:38,212
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

44
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,514
<i>My people have been massacred.</i>

45
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:45,821
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

46
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:56,566
<i>You summoned me, Masters?</i>

47
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,806
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

48
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,341
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

49
00:04:05,408 --> 00:04:06,942
<i>My people have been massacred,</i>

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,645
<i>and Almec is now the prime minister.</i>

51
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:11,213
<i>I can't explain everything now</i>

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,183
<i>but Almec has the support
of the crime families.</i>

53
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:18,519
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

54
00:04:21,256 --> 00:04:24,259
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi.

55
00:04:24,326 --> 00:04:28,029
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years.

56
00:04:28,097 --> 00:04:31,266
And according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

57
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:33,936
they're no longer in league
with the Separatists.

58
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,771
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

59
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:37,773
it was most likely an independent act

60
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,209
caused by the Death Watch alone.

61
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:42,611
Without involvement
from the Separatists,

62
00:04:42,679 --> 00:04:45,715
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

63
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:47,550
I'm afraid we cannot help.

64
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,520
We cannot just hand Mandalore
over to these crime families

65
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,189
and let Satine become a martyr.

66
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:54,825
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

67
00:04:54,892 --> 00:04:57,627
makes this situation difficult.

68
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:00,797
Understand your feelings I do,
Obi-Wan.

69
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,299
But to take action,

70
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,736
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

71
00:05:05,803 --> 00:05:08,171
You know what the Senate will decide.

72
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:11,308
They will not send aid
to a neutral system.

73
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:15,679
At this time, nothing more can we do.

74
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:21,952
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

75
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,621
including the renegade
Death Watch soldiers.

76
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,256
But we will find them.

77
00:05:26,324 --> 00:05:28,659
The duchess appears
to have contacted the Jedi

78
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:30,093
just as anticipated.

79
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:31,462
Good.

80
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,564
You have done well.

81
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:35,599
What of the people?

82
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,135
You are the legitimate prime minister.

83
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:39,804
Mandalore is a sovereign planet

84
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,108
and you will maintain its neutrality.

85
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,476
And what of the Jedi?

86
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,680
Because of Mandalore's neutrality,

87
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:51,282
the Jedi have no jurisdiction here.

88
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,953
If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend,

89
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:59,390
he will have to come alone.

90
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,218
Ah.

91
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,686
Ah!

92
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:33,123
Anakin, that's the last time
I borrow a ship from you.

93
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:46,570
You better get your ship looked at.

94
00:06:46,637 --> 00:06:48,638
Oh, it's my friend's ship.

95
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,129
He told me it was perfectly fine.

96
00:06:53,276 --> 00:06:54,477
Terribly sorry about that.

97
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,478
Do you have a landing permit?

98
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:59,148
Um, I think I left it in the ship.

99
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:01,150
Come with me, and I'll get it.

100
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:53,319
Here to do more
of your master's bidding?

101
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,989
I do my own bidding.

102
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,623
Obi-Wan.

103
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,396
Are you alone?

104
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,464
Yes.

105
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:05,972
The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,234
will be of no help to us here.

107
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:15,174
I trust you have an escape plan then?

108
00:08:15,242 --> 00:08:16,976
As always, my dear.

109
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:28,287
There's no record
of a prisoner transfer here.

110
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:30,589
The orders came from upstairs.

111
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:36,195
What's the authorization code?

112
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:38,097
Oh, um...

113
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:46,348
Hey, you!

114
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,372
Stop!

115
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,442
It's the duchess.

116
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,877
She's getting away.

117
00:09:29,049 --> 00:09:30,917
We have to contact my sister for help.

118
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:32,619
She'll send reinforcements.

119
00:09:32,686 --> 00:09:34,154
Who's your sister?

120
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,104
Brace yourself!

121
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,447
Let's get out of here.

122
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:02,152
Obi-Wan!

123
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:31,282
No.
It can't be.

124
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:41,393
We meet again, Kenobi.

125
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,462
Welcome to my world.

126
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,467
Take them back to the palace.

127
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:07,020
Your noble flaw is a weakness
shared by you...

128
00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:08,922
and your duchess.

129
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,992
You should have chosen the dark side,

130
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:13,526
Master Jedi.

131
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,598
Your emotions betray you.

132
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,633
Your fear,

133
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,836
and yes, your anger.

134
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:27,973
Let your anger deepen your hatred.

135
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,875
Don't listen to him, Obi...

136
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:31,410
Quiet.

137
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:35,547
You can kill me,
but you will never destroy me.

138
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:38,050
It takes strength
to resist the dark side.

139
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,151
Only the weak embrace it.

140
00:11:40,219 --> 00:11:42,320
It is more powerful than you know.

141
00:11:42,388 --> 00:11:44,522
And those who oppose it
are more powerful

142
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,757
than you'll ever be.

143
00:11:46,826 --> 00:11:48,460
I know where you're from.

144
00:11:48,527 --> 00:11:50,362
I've been to your village.

145
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:53,999
I know the decision to join
the dark side wasn't yours.

146
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,701
The Nightsisters made it for you.

147
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:56,768
Silence!

148
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,971
You think you know me?

149
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:01,573
It was I who languished for years

150
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:03,609
thinking of nothing but you.

151
00:12:03,676 --> 00:12:05,544
Nothing but this moment.

152
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,084
And now the perfect tool
for my vengeance

153
00:12:11,151 --> 00:12:13,119
is in front of us.

154
00:12:13,187 --> 00:12:15,255
I never planned on killing you.

155
00:12:15,322 --> 00:12:19,659
But I will make you share
my pain, Kenobi.

156
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:33,539
Satine.

157
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:48,388
Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...

158
00:12:52,193 --> 00:12:54,428
I've loved you always.

159
00:12:55,997 --> 00:12:58,465
I always will.

160
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:12,712
Do we kill him now, brother?

161
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,381
No.

162
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:15,782
Imprison him below.

163
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,586
Let him drown in his misery.

164
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:22,222
Take him to his cell to rot.

165
00:13:43,343 --> 00:13:45,845
You summoned me, Chancellor?

166
00:13:45,913 --> 00:13:48,047
Prepare my ship.

167
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,707
- Ah!
- It's the rebels!

168
00:14:35,463 --> 00:14:37,530
Sorry, I don't believe we've met.

169
00:14:37,598 --> 00:14:38,598
You are?

170
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:39,699
Bo-Katan.

171
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:40,867
I'm here to rescue you.

172
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:42,402
That's all you need to know.

173
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,504
Sounds good to me.

174
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,773
You ever used one of these before?

175
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,110
No, but in this case,
I'm a fast learner.

176
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:51,177
Let's go.

177
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:37,233
Halt!

178
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,134
Maul must really want you dead.

179
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,437
You have no idea.

180
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:53,080
Hmm, I sense a presence.

181
00:16:53,147 --> 00:16:56,249
A presence
I haven't felt since...

182
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,118
Master.

183
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,700
Master.

184
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:20,006
I am most impressed to see
you have survived your injuries.

185
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,475
I used your training, Master.

186
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,777
And I have built all this

187
00:17:24,845 --> 00:17:28,047
in hopes of returning to your side.

188
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,782
Hmm.

189
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,851
How unfortunate

190
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,855
that are attempting to deceive me.

191
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:37,657
Master?

192
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,830
You have become a rival!

193
00:18:43,595 --> 00:18:46,130
Go back to your Republic
and tell them what has happened.

194
00:18:46,198 --> 00:18:48,332
That would likely lead
to a Republic invasion

195
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
of Mandalore.

196
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,269
Yes, and Maul will die.

197
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,304
But Mandalore will survive.

198
00:18:53,372 --> 00:18:55,539
We always survive.

199
00:18:55,607 --> 00:18:58,309
Now go.

200
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,711
Your Satine's sister, aren't you?

201
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:04,916
I'm so sorry.

202
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:24,636
Oof.

203
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,020
Ugh!

204
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,390
Uh!

205
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:11,016
Brother.

206
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:29,801
Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice.

207
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,838
I'm not like you.

208
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:35,574
I never was.

209
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,714
Remember, the first
and only reality of the Sith:

210
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,183
there can only be two.

211
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:50,022
And you are no longer my apprentice.

212
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:54,293
You have been replaced.

213
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,664
Ugh!

214
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:36,371
Have mercy.

215
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,806
Please.

216
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:38,974
Please!

217
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,709
There is no mercy.

218
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,082
Do not worry.

219
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,751
I'm not going to kill you.

220
00:21:49,818 --> 00:21:53,388
I have other uses for you.

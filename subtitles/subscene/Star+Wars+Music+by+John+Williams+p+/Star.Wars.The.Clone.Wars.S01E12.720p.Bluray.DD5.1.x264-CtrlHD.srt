6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,619

9
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:52,092
(GROANING) Master? What happened?

10
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:57,264
Well, I guess that pirate brew
is stronger than we thought.

11
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,226
-I only took a sip.
-We were drugged, obviously.

12
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:05,647
-Why would they risk losing the ransom?
-The deal appears to have changed.

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,816
They must be trying to triple their payday.

14
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:13,322
-A shrewd observation, Master Kenobi.
-Oh, great, it's you.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,034
I did warn you these pirates were devious.

16
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,953
You will notice
our shackles are bound together.

17
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:24,458
I have tried to separate us, to no avail.

18
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,960
It's bad enough
we have to be in the same cell,

19
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:30,255
but could you at least spare me
the sound of your constant chatter?

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,800
And while I hold my tongue,

21
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,928
the two of you will devise
a brilliant strategy

22
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,430
for getting off this godforsaken planet?

23
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,681
-Yes!
-Yes!

24
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,225
DOOKU: Excellent.

25
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:47,523
I told you kidnapping the Sith Lord
was a stroke of brilliance.

26
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,692
I can almost smell that spice now.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,362
It'll be worth twice as much to us
on the black market.

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,449
But I think we could've gotten a bigger
ransom from the Separatists.

29
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:02,371
(SIGHS) You fool. Sometimes I wonder
why I bother to keep you around.

30
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:07,084
If we tried to ransom Count Dooku
off to the Separatists,

31
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:11,713
they would simply send
their droid armies here to wipe us out.

32
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,010
As my sweet mother always said,

33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,557
"Son, if one hostage is good,
two are better.

34
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,226

that's just good business."

Don't you worry about how much.
You'll get your cut.

38
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,987
Just see to it
that the Republic's ransom gets here.

39
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,575
Once we get the ransom for the Sith,
then we'll get the ransom for the Jedi.

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,577
Thank you, Mom!

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,124
The spice is on its way.

42
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,668
Hondo has asked me to go out
and meet the Republic Senators

43
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,628
and bring them here with the ransom.

44
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:55,132
But I want you to intercept that ship
and force it down.

45
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:59,011
Be careful. I want that spice intact.

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,640
It's too risky. What about Hondo?

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,936
That nitwit couldn't kill a nuna.
He depends on me for that.

48
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,773
I'll tell him the ship was destroyed
with everyone on it, including the spice.

49
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,527

we'll be long gone.

Captain Hondo,
the leader of those brigands,

will accept the ransom
and turn Count Dooku over to the Jedi,

57
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,805
and then they will bring him back
with you.

58

and doesn't move like he used to.

170
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,556
I suppose you're right.

171
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,644
I would kill you both right now
if I did not have to drag your bodies.

172
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,319
-Look! There they are!
-Giddyup.

173
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,395
Let him go, sir. We've got the spice back.

174
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,899
(ALARM SOUNDING)

175
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,902
(GROANS)

176
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,530
Now we just have to get beyond that wall.

177
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,989
Let's go.

178
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,260
-(STRAINING) This is not going well.
-Don't let them get away!

179
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,930
(GROANS)

180
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,434
Hey! What are you guys doing?

181
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,604
(GROANING) You're too heavy. I can't do it.

182
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,525
Drop Dooku!

183
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:25,113
(SIGHS) I guess this means
we won't be friends.

184
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,452
Right. Now that we have the spice,
we need to find the compound.

185
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,620
Anything to the south?

186
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,749
Nothing, sir. Who knows where
that pirate stronghold is from here.

187
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:42,964
Well, look at that. Power lines!
They must lead somewhere.

188
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,800
There'sa power, there'sa be people, too.

189
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,808
(YELPS)

190
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,976
Captain?

191
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:59,898
Well, Turk,
did the Republic arrive with my spice?

192
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,774
The Republic deceived us!

193
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,152
They didn't send a ransom.
They sent an army.

194
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:08,573
They ambushed us in Doshar Field.
I suggest we counterattack with tanks.

195
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,118
-Where are your men?
-I was the only survivor.

196
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,288
I think they will attack us
to try and free the Jedi.

197
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,333
(GRUNTS) I warned them.

198
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,211
I didn't want to torture anyone. But now...

199
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,592
Even in a galaxy at war,
you hope to find some honor.

200
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,470
Let me take our tanks. I'll make them pay.

201
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,182
Go! Stop them
before they reach the compound.

202
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:38,311
-I will deal with the Jedi.
-Yes, Captain.

203
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,652
We have to find a way out of here
before Senator Kharrus and Jar Jar arrive,

204
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,570
or we'll look like fools.

205
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,240
-I think it's time to lose the dead weight.
-Anakin.

206

(DOOR OPENS)

207
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,370
Hey, you two, come with us.

208
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,882
There be some bombad clankens
coming thissa way.

209
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,594
-What? "Bombad clankens"?
-Mmm-hmm. Right there.

210
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,888
-Where?
-There! No!

211
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,683
-Wait...
-Over there!

212
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,520
Oh! You're right. Bombad clankers.

213
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:27,402
Representative Binks,
we're going to need your services

214
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,237
for this part of the mission.

215
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,572
-Whosa? Mesa?
-Yes, sir.

216
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,866
You are the Senate Representative.

217
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,870
We need you to go out there
and negotiate with the pirates.

218
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,790
Mesa no liken this idea.

219
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,085
But I think itsa
what Senator Kharrus woulda dosa.

220
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,465
-He's probably gonna get himself killed.
-Don't worry. He's smarter than he looks.

221
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:02,895
I take it the Republic didn't arrive
with the ransom.

222
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,106
(ALL LAUGHING)

223
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:11,112
Your Republic obviously doesn't want
the Sith Lord.

224
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,572
They didn't show?

225
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,241
Oh, oh, they did. They did show

226
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,160
with a huge army

227
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:22,081
that they thought would be enough
to get the better of me! Hondo!

228
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,793
-That can't be right.
-Are you calling me a liar?

229
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,463
Isn't that kind of what you do for a living?

230
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:34,177
You reject my hospitality,
refuse to wait in your cell

231
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,182
-and now you're going to insult me?
-I'm just saying...

232
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,143
-Anakin.
-What? He is a pirate.

233
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:46,647
Yes, but this may not be the best time
for you to speak.

234
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,900
-But you...
-At all, Anakin!

235
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:53,154
(BOTH SCREAMING)

236
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,329
What are you supposed to be?

237
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:06,209
Mesa Representative Binks.
Mesa coming to deliver the spicen.

238
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:11,214
-Where's the army Turk reported?
-Don't know.

239
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,008
Let's fry this one and look around.

240
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:19,555
No. If he's a Representative,
he might be worth something as well.

241
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,350
You! Representative Bink!

242
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:26,938
We'll take you to your Jedi friends
so you can, uh, negotiate.

244
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,900
Okey day!

245
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,862
Sir, they're taking
Representative Binks hostage.

246
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,030
Get ready.

247
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,537
Whoops! Whoopsie!

248
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,622
Sorry. Sorry.

He's no Representative, he's a plague!

Whosa plaguea? Mesa?

257

I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Nice work, sir.

258
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,227
We're leaving without the spice?

until Hondo figures out what's happened.

What... What are you doing?

262
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,793
What chance do you really have, Jedi?

263
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:17,423
Now, let me go, and I might let you live.

264
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,634
Approach us, and he dies.

265
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:26,224
Looks like your forces were destroyed, Jedi.

-Ani! Obi!
-Jar Jar?

267

-Mesa have arrived with the spicen.
-Excellent, Jar Jar.

268
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,193
Assuming the pirates
still have Count Dooku to trade.

269
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:47,203
Well, that answers that question.

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,335
Commander, start the engines, please.

271
00:20:54,419 --> 00:21:00,049
So what now, Jedi?
You're going to arrest me?

272
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,386
-No. Anakin, release him.
-What?

273
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,471
Captain, you have nothing we want.

274
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,557
And since we're not prisoners anymore,
you have no bargaining power.

275
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:13,312
What? Yousa was in bombad trouble?
Mesa rescued you.

276

-No, Jar Jar, we weren't in any trouble.
-Let's leave on even terms.

Hold. Hold.

you're just going to walk away?

and we seek no revenge.

Indeed. Very honorable, Master Jedi.

281
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,465
Oh, Captain, you will find that Count Dooku
does not share our sense of honor.

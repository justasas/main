1
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,536
Did you hear that?

2
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:34,956
They shut down the main reactor.
We’ll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,832
This is madness.

4
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,344
We’re doomed.

5
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,974
There’ll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:57,603
What’s that?

7
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,874
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:58,516 --> 00:06:00,685
At last! Where have you been?

9
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,688
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:08,317
We’ll be sent to the spice mines of Kessel,
or smashed into who knows what!

11
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:11,153
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

12
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,585
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,588
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:34,844
- What have you done with those plans?
- We intercepted no transmissions.

15
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,973
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

16
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:43,686
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

17
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,985
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans...

18
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,113
and bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

19
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,377
There's one. Set for stun.

20
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:16,886
She’ll be all right.
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

21
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,390
Hey! You're not permitted in there.
It’s restricted.

22
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,143
You'll be deactivated for sure.

23
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:28,606
Don't you call me a mindless philosopher
you overweight glob of grease!

24
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,775
Now come out before somebody sees you.

25
00:07:31,901 --> 00:07:37,531
“Secret mission”? What plans? What are you
talking about? I'm not getting in there.

26
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:42,286
I'm going to regret this.

27
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,295
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire.

28
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,298
There's no life forms.
It must have short-circuited.

29
00:07:54,423 --> 00:07:57,927
That’s funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

30
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:02,181
Are you sure this thing is safe?

31
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,391
Oh.

32
00:08:21,075 --> 00:08:23,702
Darth Vader.
Only you could be so bold.

33
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:27,206
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you’ve attacked a diplomatic-

34
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:31,544
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.
You weren't on any mercy mission this time.

35
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:35,589
Several transmissions were
beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

36
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:38,592
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

37
00:08:38,676 --> 00:08:40,469
I don't know what you're talking about.

38
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:43,806
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

39
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:46,725
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

40
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:48,853
Take her away!

41
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,359
Holding her is dangerous.
If word of this gets out...

42
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:58,112
it could generate sympathy
for the rebellion in the Senate.

43
00:08:58,487 --> 00:09:03,325
I've traced the rebel spies to her. Now she
is my only link to finding their secret base.

44
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,579
- She’ll die before she'll tell you anything.
- Leave that to me.

45
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,250
Send a distress signal and then inform
the Senate that all aboard were killed.

46
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:14,670
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

47
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:16,547
and no transmissions were made.

48
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:20,175
An escape pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

49
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:22,678
She must have hidden the plans
in the escape pod.

50
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:26,682
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

51
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:30,436
- There’ll be no one to stop us this time.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:47,161
How did we get into this mess?

53
00:09:47,202 --> 00:09:49,580
I really don’t know how.

54
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,208
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

55
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:59,715
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

56
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:09,558
What a desolate place this is!

57
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,230
Where do you think you’re going?

58
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,316
Well, I'm not going that way.

59
00:10:17,441 --> 00:10:20,444
It's much too rocky.
This way is much easier.

60
00:10:21,362 --> 00:10:24,365
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

61
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,868
Don’t get technical with me.

62
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,746
What mission? What are you talking about?

63
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,626
I've just about had enough of you.

64
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:40,464
Go that way. You'll be malfunctioning
within a day you nearsighted scrap pile.

65
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:44,969
And don't let me catch you following me
begging for help, because you won’t get it.

66
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:02,111
No more adventures.
I'm not going that way.

67
00:11:36,895 --> 00:11:40,566
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

68
00:11:40,691 --> 00:11:44,570
He tricked me into going this way,
but he'll do no better.

69
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:53,078
Wait! What's that?
A transport! I'm saved!

70
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:56,707
Over here! Hey! Hey!

71
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,462
Help! Please help!

72
00:15:31,755 --> 00:15:33,257
R2?

73
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,429
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

74
00:15:57,698 --> 00:16:01,702
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

75
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,829
Look, sir. Droids.

76
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,551
Wake up! Wake up!

77
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,226
We’re doomed.

78
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,987
Do you think they'll melt us down?

79
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,876
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

80
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,462
Will this never end?

81
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:34,920
All right, ﬁne. Let's go.

82
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:37,172
Luke! Luke!

83
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:45,555
Luke, tell Uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

84
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,226
Doesn't look like we have much
of a choice, but I'll remind him.

85
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:02,656
Yeah, we'll take that red one.
No, not that one.

86
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,537
You, I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

87
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:12,416
Protocol? Why, it’s my primary function,
sir. I am well-versed in all the customs-

88
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,419
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

89
00:18:15,544 --> 00:18:18,422
Not in an environment such as this.
That is why I have been programmed-

90
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:23,802
What I really need is a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

91
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,179
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

92
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:28,932
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

93
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,767
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course I can, sir. It's like...

94
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:34,938
a second language to me. I'm as fluent... Yeah,
all right. Shut up. Luke, take this one. Luke!

95
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,944
Take these two over to the garage, will
you? I want them cleaned up before dinner.

96
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,530
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

97
00:18:43,572 --> 00:18:46,533
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

98
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:51,079
- Now come on. Get to it.
- All right. Come on.

99
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,834
And the red one. Come on.

100
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,546
Well, come on, red. Let's go.

101
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,484
- Uncle Owen!
- Yeah?

102
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:23,361
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

103
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:26,072
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

104
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:33,371
Excuse me, sir but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

105
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:36,374
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

106
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,753
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

107
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,131
- Yeah, take this away.
- You'll be very pleased with that one, sir.

108
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,134
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

109
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,094
Here he comes.

110
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:53,016
Okay, let's go.

111
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:55,769
Now, don't you forget this.
Why I should stick my neck out for you...

112
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:57,854
is quite beyond my capacity.

113
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:08,031
Thank the maker!
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

114
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:12,494
I've got such a bad case
of dust contamination I can barely move.

115
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:17,666
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

116
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:22,045
<i>—</i> Is there anything I might do to help?
No. Not unless you can alter time...

117
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,131
speed up the harvest,
or teleport me off this rock.

118
00:20:25,298 --> 00:20:29,553
I don’t think so, sir. I'm only a droid, and
not very knowledgeable about such things...

119
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:34,891
not on this planet, anyway. As a matter of
fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

120
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:39,938
Well, if there's a bright center to the universe,
you're on the planet that it’s farthest from.

121
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,066
- I see, sir.
- You can call me Luke.

122
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:45,151
I see, Sir Luke.

123
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,404
Just Luke.

124
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:53,034
Oh. And I am C-3P0, human-cyborg relations.
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

125
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:56,079
Hello.

126
00:20:57,205 --> 00:21:00,542
You got a lot of carbon scoring here. Looks
like you boys have seen a lot of action.

127
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:02,961
With all we've been through,
sometimes I'm amazed...

128
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:05,847
we’re in as good condition as we are,
what with the rebellion and all.

129
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,764
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?!

130
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,969
That’s how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

131
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,805
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

132
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,684
Actually, there's not much to tell.
I'm not much more than an interpreter...

133
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:22,063
and not very good at telling stories. Well,
not at making them interesting, anyway.

134
00:21:23,106 --> 00:21:27,068
Well, my little friend, you got something
jammed in here real good.

135
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,112
Were you on a Starcruiser or-

136
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,616
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

137
00:21:32,741 --> 00:21:34,326
What's this?

138
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:37,370
“What is what"? He asked you a question.
What is that?

139
00:21:37,495 --> 00:21:41,207
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

140
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:48,465
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

141
00:21:50,884 --> 00:21:55,388
Oh. He says it’s nothing, sir. Merely
a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind.

142
00:21:55,472 --> 00:21:57,891
Who is she? She's beautiful.

143
00:21:57,974 --> 00:22:01,353
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

144
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:03,855
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

145
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,150
A person of some importance, I believe.
Our captain was attached to-

146
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:09,361
Is there any more to this recording?

147
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:13,531
Behave yourself, R2.
You’re going to get us into trouble.

148
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:16,660
It's all right. You can trust him.
He’s our new master.

149
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:22,624
He says that he's the property
of Obi-Wan Kenobi...

150
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:26,127
a resident of these parts
and it’s a private message for him.

151
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:28,171
Quite frankly, sir, I don't know what
he’s talking about.

152
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:31,800
Our last master was Captain Antilles.
But with all we've been through...

153
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:34,052
this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

154
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:38,264
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

155
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:41,017
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

156
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:45,897
Well, I don’t know anyone named Obi-Wan,
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

157
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,900
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

158
00:22:49,442 --> 00:22:52,654
I wonder who she is.
Sounds like she's in trouble.

159
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:54,698
I better play back the whole thing.

160
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:01,705
He says the restraining bolt
has short-circuited his recording system.

161
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:04,332
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

162
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:06,584
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

163
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,421
Hm? Oh, yeah. Well...

164
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:11,965
I guess you're too small
to run away on me...

165
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,175
if I take this off. Okay...

166
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:19,097
There you go.

167
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,685
Wait a minute. Where’d she go? Bring her
back. Play back the entire message.

168
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:27,230
“What message”?
The one you’ve just been playing!

169
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,315
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

170
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,484
Luke! Luke!

171
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:35,071
- All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.
- I'm sorry, sir...

172
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:37,490
but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

173
00:23:37,615 --> 00:23:40,994
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be ﬁghtback.

174
00:23:43,747 --> 00:23:46,374
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

175
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,878
No, I don’t think he likes you at all.

176
00:23:50,503 --> 00:23:52,756
No, I don’t like you, either.

177
00:24:01,097 --> 00:24:03,892
You know, I think that R2 unit
we bought might have been stolen.

178
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:05,643
What makes you think that?

179
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,645
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

180
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:10,774
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

181
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:17,280
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

182
00:24:19,115 --> 00:24:23,870
- I wonder if he's related to Ben.
- That Wizard's just a crazy old man.

183
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:27,916
Tomorrow, I want you to take that R2 unit
to Anchorhead and have its memory erased.

184
00:24:28,124 --> 00:24:31,753
That’ll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

185
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:35,048
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

186
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:40,553
He won't. I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

187
00:24:41,137 --> 00:24:43,932
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

188
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:48,061
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

189
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,717
In the morning, I want them
up there on the south ridge...

190
00:24:50,814 --> 00:24:53,942
- working on those condensers.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:57,779
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

192
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:01,324
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking
about our agreement...

193
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:05,286
about me staying on another season?

194
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:08,581
And if these new droids do work out,
I want to transmit my application...

195
00:25:08,665 --> 00:25:10,583
- to the academy this year.
- You mean the next semester...

196
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:13,837
- before the harvest?
- Sure. There's more than enough droids.

197
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:17,173
Harvest is when I need you the most.
It's only one season more.

198
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,178
This year we'll make enough on the harvest
that I’ll be able to hire some more hands...

199
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:26,724
and then you can go to the academy next year.
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

200
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,602
- But it's a whole ’nother year!
- Look, it's only one more season.

201
00:25:29,686 --> 00:25:32,105
Yeah, that’s what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

202
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:34,607
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

203
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:36,371
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

204
00:25:36,484 --> 00:25:39,863
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

205
00:25:40,363 --> 00:25:44,951
- It means so much to him.
- I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.

206
00:25:46,703 --> 00:25:50,582
Luke’s just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

207
00:25:50,957 --> 00:25:53,459
That's what I'm afraid of.

208
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,927
What are you doing hiding back there?

209
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,888
It wasn't my fault, sir.
Please don't deactivate me.

210
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,058
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

211
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:53,686
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

212
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:04,948
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

213
00:27:05,031 --> 00:27:06,950
These asteroids are getting
quite out of hand.

214
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:09,327
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

215
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:13,206
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!

216
00:27:13,456 --> 00:27:15,959
- Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?
- It's too dangerous...

217
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:19,087
with all the Sand People around.
We'll have to wait until morning.

218
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,339
Luke! I'm shutting the power down.

219
00:27:21,464 --> 00:27:24,968
All right! I'll be there in a few minutes.
Boy, am I gonna get it.

220
00:27:26,094 --> 00:27:27,971
You know, that little droid's gonna
cause me a lot of trouble.

221
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:30,473
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

222
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,361
Luke? Luke! Luke!

223
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:54,872
Have you seen Luke this morning?

224
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:58,376
He said he had some things to do
before he started today so he left early.

225
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:01,879
- Did he take those two new droids with him?
- I think so.

226
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,250
Well, he better have those units
in the south range...

227
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,843
repaired by midday,
or there’ll be hell to pay.

228
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:10,388
Look, there's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

229
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:13,641
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator!

230
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,874
Hey, whoa! Just where do
you think you're going?

231
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,377
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

232
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:45,006
We’ll have no more of this
Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

233
00:28:45,173 --> 00:28:48,301
And don't talk to me of your mission, either.
You’re fortunate he doesn't blast you...

234
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,929
- into a million pieces right here!
- No. It's all right, but I think we'd better go.

235
00:28:53,931 --> 00:28:55,516
What’s wrong with him now?

236
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,394
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

237
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:01,022
Sand People, or worse.

238
00:29:02,648 --> 00:29:05,693
Come on, let's go have a look.
Come on!

239
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:10,156
Well, there are two Banthas down there...

240
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:12,533
but I don't see any...
Wait a second.

241
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:16,829
They're Sand People, all right.
I can see one of them now.

242
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:32,788
Hello, there.

243
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,035
Come here, my little friend.
Don’t be afraid.

244
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:42,915
Oh, don't worry.
He'll be all right.

245
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:50,119
Rest easy, son.
You've had a busy day.

246
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,052
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

247
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,819
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

248
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:02,577
Boy, am I glad to see you.

249
00:31:02,703 --> 00:31:05,706
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

250
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:12,462
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

251
00:31:13,213 --> 00:31:15,298
This little droid.

252
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,302
I think he’s searching for his former master,
but I’ve never seen such devotion...

253
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,346
in a droid before.

254
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,183
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

255
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,979
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

256
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:33,567
Obi-Wan Kenobi? Obi-Wan.

257
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:39,990
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

258
00:31:40,741 --> 00:31:42,617
A long time.

259
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:46,621
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

260
00:31:46,997 --> 00:31:49,750
Oh, he’s not dead. Not yet.

261
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,337
- You know him?
- Well, of course I know him. He’s me.

262
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,260
I haven’t gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

263
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,846
since, oh, before you were born.

264
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,015
Well, then the droid does belong to you.

265
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,517
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

266
00:32:09,895 --> 00:32:12,022
Very interesting.

267
00:32:13,106 --> 00:32:18,361
I think we’d better get indoors.
The Sand People are easily startled...

268
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,031
but they'll soon be back,
and in greater numbers.

269
00:32:23,867 --> 00:32:25,869
3P0.

270
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,631
Where am I?
I must have taken a bad step.

271
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:42,135
Can you stand? We've got to get out of here
before the Sand People return.

272
00:32:42,177 --> 00:32:44,679
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

273
00:32:44,805 --> 00:32:47,516
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account.

274
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:49,684
I'm done for.

275
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:53,814
- No, you’re not. What kind of talk is that?
- Quickly. They’re on the move.

276
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,823
No, my father didn’t fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

277
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,699
That's what your uncle told you.

278
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:07,786
He didn’t hold with your father’s ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here...

279
00:33:07,828 --> 00:33:09,704
and not gotten involved.

280
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,793
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes. I was once a Jedi knight...

281
00:33:14,835 --> 00:33:16,962
the same as your father.

282
00:33:19,214 --> 00:33:23,969
- I wish I'd known him.
- He was the best star pilot in the galaxy...

283
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:26,346
and a cunning warrior.

284
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:29,975
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

285
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:35,230
And he was a good friend.
Which reminds me...

286
00:33:36,606 --> 00:33:38,692
I have something here for you.

287
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:44,114
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

288
00:33:44,197 --> 00:33:46,741
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

289
00:33:46,867 --> 00:33:51,121
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade...

290
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,998
like your father did.

291
00:33:53,081 --> 00:33:55,375
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

292
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,502
Sure. Go ahead.

293
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:03,258
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

294
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,636
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

295
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,640
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

296
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:16,646
An elegant weapon
for a more civilized age.

297
00:34:17,731 --> 00:34:20,901
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights were the guardians...

298
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:24,154
of peace and justice
in the old Republic...

299
00:34:24,905 --> 00:34:28,783
before the dark times...
before the Empire.

300
00:34:32,162 --> 00:34:34,497
How did my father die?

301
00:34:36,249 --> 00:34:38,543
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

302
00:34:38,793 --> 00:34:41,379
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

303
00:34:42,297 --> 00:34:45,508
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

304
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,930
He betrayed and murdered your father.

305
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,850
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

306
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,730
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

307
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,441
The Force?

308
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,361
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

309
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:07,489
It's an energy ﬁeld created
by all living things.

310
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:12,202
It surrounds us, penetrates us,
it binds the galaxy together.

311
00:35:19,626 --> 00:35:22,754
Now let’s see if we can’t figure out
what you are, my little friend...

312
00:35:23,004 --> 00:35:25,256
and where you come from.

313
00:35:25,382 --> 00:35:28,468
- I saw part of a message he w-
- I seem to have found it.

314
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:32,847
<i>General Kenobi, years ago
you served my father in the Clone Wars.</i>

315
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,476
<i>Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.</i>

316
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:39,604
<i>I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person.</i>

317
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:41,481
<i>But my ship has fallen under attack...</i>

318
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:44,484
<i>and I am afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.</i>

319
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,487
<i>I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...</i>

320
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,408
<i>into the memory systems of this R2 unit.
My father will know how to retrieve it.</i>

321
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:55,787
<i>You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.</i>

322
00:35:56,162 --> 00:35:58,415
<i>This is our most desperate hour.</i>

323
00:35:58,665 --> 00:36:01,793
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.</i>

324
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,812
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

325
00:36:21,896 --> 00:36:24,315
Alderaan?
I'm not going to Alderaan.

326
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:26,901
I've got to get home. It's late.
I'm in for it as it is.

327
00:36:27,027 --> 00:36:29,404
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

328
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,449
I’m getting too old for this sort of thing.

329
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,832
I can’t get involved.
I've got work to do.

330
00:36:41,541 --> 00:36:46,046
It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it, but
there’s nothing I can do about it right now.

331
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:51,801
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That’s your uncle talking.

332
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,804
My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

333
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,557
Learn about the Force, Luke.

334
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:06,357
Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

335
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:10,487
You can get a transport there to
Mos Eisley or wherever you’re going.

336
00:37:11,237 --> 00:37:14,115
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

337
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:25,460
Until this battle station
is fully operational, we are vulnerable.

338
00:37:25,835 --> 00:37:29,714
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you realize.

339
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,511
Dangerous to your star fleet, Commander...
not to this battle station.

340
00:37:34,886 --> 00:37:38,723
The rebellion will continue to gain support
in the Imperial Senate-

341
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:42,519
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

342
00:37:42,602 --> 00:37:46,731
I have just received word that the Emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

343
00:37:47,107 --> 00:37:51,027
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

344
00:37:51,111 --> 00:37:52,779
That's impossible.

345
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:55,657
How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

346
00:37:55,782 --> 00:37:59,911
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

347
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:04,040
Fear will keep the local systems in line...

348
00:38:04,374 --> 00:38:07,544
- fear of this battle station.
- And what of the rebellion?

349
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:10,922
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

350
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:15,176
it is possible, however unlikely, that
they might find a weakness and exploit it.

351
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:19,514
The plans you refer to will
soon be back in our hands.

352
00:38:19,889 --> 00:38:22,016
Any attack made by the rebels
against this station...

353
00:38:22,142 --> 00:38:25,937
would be a useless gesture, no matter
what technical data they’ve obtained.

354
00:38:26,187 --> 00:38:29,691
This station is now the ultimate power
in the universe.

355
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,318
I suggest we use it.

356
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,947
Don’t be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

357
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,784
The ability to destroy a
planet is insignificant...

358
00:38:39,826 --> 00:38:41,828
next to the power of the Force.

359
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:45,415
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer’s ways, Lord Vader.

360
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:48,334
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

361
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:51,045
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

362
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:55,466
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebel’s hidden fortr...

363
00:39:02,056 --> 00:39:04,225
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

364
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:08,813
Enough of this.
Vader, release him.

365
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,732
As you wish.

366
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,861
This bickering is pointless.

367
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:19,574
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

368
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:22,493
by the time this station is operational.

369
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,497
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

370
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:35,256
It looks like the Sand People
did this, all right.

371
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,133
Look. There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

372
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:39,719
It's just, I've never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

373
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:43,139
They didn’t...
but we are meant to think they did.

374
00:39:43,264 --> 00:39:47,393
These tracks are side-by-side.
Sand People always ride single file...

375
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,395
to hide their numbers.

376
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,273
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3P0.

377
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:56,778
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sand People.

378
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,490
Only Imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

379
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:03,743
But why would Imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

380
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,793
If they traced the robots here, they
may have learned who they sold them to...

381
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,045
and that would lead them back... home!

382
00:40:14,796 --> 00:40:17,799
Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous!

383
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:45,576
Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru!

384
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,787
Uncle Owen!

385
00:41:36,046 --> 00:41:41,302
And now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

386
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:27,557
There’s nothing you could
have done, Luke, had you been there.

387
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:32,229
You'd have been killed, too, and the droids
would now be in the hands of the Empire.

388
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:36,316
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

389
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:40,195
There’s nothing for me here now.
I want to learn the ways of the Force...

390
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,697
and become a Jedi like my father.

391
00:42:57,754 --> 00:43:00,006
Mos Eisley spaceport.

392
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:05,262
You will never find a more
wretched hive of scum and villainy.

393
00:43:06,012 --> 00:43:07,889
We must be cautious.

394
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:26,366
- How long have you had these droids?
- About three or four seasons.

395
00:43:26,491 --> 00:43:28,994
They’re up for sale if you want them.

396
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:33,540
- Let me see your identification.
- You don't need to see his identification.

397
00:43:34,666 --> 00:43:38,503
- We don't need to see his identification.
- These aren’t the droids you're looking for.

398
00:43:39,754 --> 00:43:41,923
These aren't the droids we’re looking for.

399
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:44,175
He can go about his business.

400
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:47,554
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

401
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,682
Move along. Move along.

402
00:44:01,693 --> 00:44:04,446
I can’t abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures!

403
00:44:05,822 --> 00:44:07,699
Go on, go on.

404
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:12,329
I can't understand how we got by
those troops. I thought we were dead.

405
00:44:12,412 --> 00:44:16,583
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

406
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,340
Do you really think we're gonna find a
pilot here that’ll take us to Alderaan?

407
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:25,967
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here...

408
00:44:26,092 --> 00:44:29,346
only watch your step.
This place can be a little rough.

409
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:32,057
I'm ready for anything.

410
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:37,562
Come along, R2.

411
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:31,241
- Hey! We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

412
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:34,619
Your droids, they'll have to wait outside.
We don’t want them here.

413
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:37,038
Why don’t you wait out by the speeder?
We don't want any trouble.

414
00:45:37,163 --> 00:45:39,040
I heartily agree with you, sir.

415
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:50,385
I'll have one of those.

416
00:46:25,795 --> 00:46:28,715
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

417
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:31,926
I don’t like you, either.

418
00:46:32,343 --> 00:46:38,058
You just watch yourself. We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

419
00:46:38,349 --> 00:46:40,226
I'll be careful.

420
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,688
- You’ll be dead!
- This little one’s not worth the effort.

421
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,232
Come, let me get you something.

422
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:50,987
No blasters! No blasters!

423
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:14,886
I'm all right.

424
00:47:16,513 --> 00:47:20,517
Chewbacca here is ﬁrst mate
on a ship that might suit us.

425
00:47:25,522 --> 00:47:27,607
I don't like the look of this.

426
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:45,667
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the <i>Millennium</i> Falcon.

427
00:47:45,917 --> 00:47:49,295
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

428
00:47:49,504 --> 00:47:51,798
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

429
00:47:52,006 --> 00:47:55,510
Fast ship? You've never heard
of the Millennium Falcon?

430
00:47:55,927 --> 00:47:57,303
Should I have?

431
00:47:57,428 --> 00:48:00,265
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

432
00:48:02,308 --> 00:48:06,646
I've outrun Imperial star ships.
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

433
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:09,315
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

434
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,319
She’s fast enough for you, old man.

435
00:48:14,028 --> 00:48:16,322
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers...

436
00:48:16,823 --> 00:48:19,576
Myself, the boy, two droids...

437
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:22,912
and no questions asked.

438
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:26,291
What is it, some kind of local trouble?

439
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:28,585
Let's just say we'd like to avoid...

440
00:48:28,668 --> 00:48:31,087
any Imperial entanglements.

441
00:48:32,672 --> 00:48:34,966
Well, that’s the real trick, isn't it?

442
00:48:35,925 --> 00:48:38,428
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

443
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,472
Ten thousand, all in advance.

444
00:48:42,682 --> 00:48:44,559
Ten thousand?

445
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,812
We could almost buy our own ship for that!

446
00:48:47,979 --> 00:48:50,982
- But who's gonna fly it, kid, you?
- You bet I could.

447
00:48:51,107 --> 00:48:54,819
I'm not such a bad pilot myself.
We don’t have to sit here and listen...

448
00:48:55,737 --> 00:48:57,989
We can pay you two thousand now...

449
00:48:58,072 --> 00:49:01,117
plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

450
00:49:02,202 --> 00:49:03,870
Seventeen, huh?

451
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:09,375
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

452
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:12,003
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

453
00:49:12,128 --> 00:49:13,838
Ninety-four.

454
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:19,385
Looks like somebody’s beginning to
take an interest in your handiwork.

455
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,638
All right. We'll check it out.

456
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,735
Seventeen thousand!

457
00:49:35,777 --> 00:49:38,738
Those guys must really be desperate.
This could really save my neck.

458
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,491
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

459
00:49:41,532 --> 00:49:43,159
You'll have to sell your speeder.

460
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:46,788
That’s okay. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

461
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,293
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

462
00:49:52,418 --> 00:49:54,295
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

463
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:10,395
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

464
00:50:14,649 --> 00:50:16,943
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

465
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:29,330
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

466
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,461
Over my dead body.

467
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,094
Yes, I'll bet you have.

468
00:50:56,816 --> 00:50:58,818
Sorry about the mess.

469
00:51:07,493 --> 00:51:10,496
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

470
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,624
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

471
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,085
The ﬁnal checkout is completed.

472
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:19,339
All systems are operational.
What course shall we set?

473
00:51:20,214 --> 00:51:23,593
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

474
00:51:23,634 --> 00:51:25,094
What do you mean?

475
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:28,389
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

476
00:51:28,514 --> 00:51:30,892
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

477
00:51:32,018 --> 00:51:34,020
Lock the door, R2.

478
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:38,775
Alright, check this side of the street.

479
00:51:42,528 --> 00:51:45,031
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

480
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:55,625
I would much rather have gone
with Master Luke than stay here with you.

481
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:58,920
I don't know what all this trouble is
about, but I'm sure it must be your fault.

482
00:51:59,629 --> 00:52:02,423
You watch your language.

483
00:52:03,633 --> 00:52:06,427
All right. Give it to me.
I'll take it.

484
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:10,181
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

485
00:52:10,264 --> 00:52:12,058
It'll be enough.

486
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:32,912
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

487
00:52:55,601 --> 00:52:57,228
What a piece of junk!

488
00:52:57,311 --> 00:52:59,439
She'll make .5 past light speed.

489
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:02,733
She may not look like much,
but she’s got it where it counts, kid.

490
00:53:02,859 --> 00:53:05,570
I've made a lot of
special modiﬁcations myself.

491
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:09,740
But we’re a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board we’ll get outta here.

492
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:16,831
Hello, sir.

493
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,841
Which way?

494
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:30,094
All right, men, load your weapons.

495
00:53:32,138 --> 00:53:34,390
Stop that ship! Blast them!

496
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:46,152
Chewie, get us out of here!

497
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:50,990
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much
I hate space travel.

498
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,798
Looks like an Imperial cruiser.

499
00:54:07,924 --> 00:54:10,301
Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought. Try and hold ’em off.

500
00:54:10,426 --> 00:54:14,430
Angle the deflector shields while I make the
calculations for the jump to light speed.

501
00:54:24,315 --> 00:54:27,151
Stay sharp. There’s two more coming in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

502
00:54:27,193 --> 00:54:29,070
Why don't you outrun ’em?
I thought you said this thing was fast!

503
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:31,795
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
gonna find yourself ﬂoating home.

504
00:54:31,822 --> 00:54:34,700
We'll be safe enough once we
make the jump to hyperspace.

505
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:37,036
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose ‘em.

506
00:54:41,457 --> 00:54:42,959
Here’s where the fun begins.

507
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:45,122
How long before you can make
the jump to light speed?

508
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:47,838
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

509
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:49,715
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

510
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,593
Traveling through hyperspace
ain’t like dusting crops, boy!

511
00:54:52,718 --> 00:54:55,054
Without precise calculations,
we’d fly right through a star...

512
00:54:55,096 --> 00:54:56,696
or bounce too close to a supernova...

513
00:54:56,722 --> 00:54:59,183
and that would end your trip
real quick, wouldn't it?

514
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:01,561
- What’s that flashing?
- We’re losing a deflector shield.

515
00:55:01,686 --> 00:55:04,480
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

516
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:28,087
We've entered the Alderaan system.

517
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:32,592
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader’s leash.

518
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:36,262
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

519
00:55:37,888 --> 00:55:39,724
Charming to the last.

520
00:55:40,516 --> 00:55:44,520
You don't know how hard I found it,
signing the order to terminate your life.

521
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:47,982
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

522
00:55:48,107 --> 00:55:52,236
Princess Leia, before your execution
I would like you to be my guest...

523
00:55:52,278 --> 00:55:55,906
at a ceremony that will make
this battle station operational.

524
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:59,160
No star system will dare
oppose the Emperor now.

525
00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:01,871
<i>The more you tighten your grip Jam“...</i>

526
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:04,540
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

527
00:56:04,624 --> 00:56:07,627
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

528
00:56:07,918 --> 00:56:13,049
In a way, you have determined the choice
of the planet that will be destroyed ﬁrst.

529
00:56:13,924 --> 00:56:18,262
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

530
00:56:18,304 --> 00:56:21,057
I have chosen to test this station's
destructive power...

531
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,185
on your home planet of Alderaan.

532
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,937
No! Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons. You can’t possibly-

533
00:56:27,063 --> 00:56:31,776
You would prefer another target?
A military target? Then name the system.

534
00:56:33,903 --> 00:56:37,073
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

535
00:56:37,823 --> 00:56:39,950
Where is the rebel base?

536
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:45,790
Dantooine.

537
00:56:46,332 --> 00:56:49,210
- They’re on Dantooine.
- There. You see, Lord Vader?

538
00:56:49,335 --> 00:56:53,839
She can be reasonable. Continue with
the operation. You may ﬁre when ready.

539
00:56:53,964 --> 00:56:56,217
- What?
- You’re far too trusting.

540
00:56:56,342 --> 00:57:00,346
Dantooine is too remote to make an
effective demonstration, but don't worry.

541
00:57:00,429 --> 00:57:03,349
We will deal with your rebel friends
soon enough.

542
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:04,934
No!

543
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,562
Commence primary ignition.

544
00:57:31,502 --> 00:57:34,380
Are you all right? What’s wrong?

545
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:37,007
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

546
00:57:37,133 --> 00:57:40,469
as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror...

547
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:45,015
and were suddenly silenced.
I fear something terrible has happened.

548
00:57:46,892 --> 00:57:49,520
You’d better get on with your exercises.

549
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:54,275
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those Imperial slugs.

550
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,527
I told you I'd outrun them.

551
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,116
Don't everybody thank me at once.

552
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:06,662
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

553
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,005
Now be careful, R2.

554
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:28,184
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

555
00:58:28,392 --> 00:58:30,561
Let him have it. It's not wise
to upset a Wookiee.

556
00:58:30,686 --> 00:58:32,897
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

557
00:58:33,272 --> 00:58:36,033
That's ’cause a droid don’t pull
people’s arms out of their sockets...

558
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:39,695
when they lose.
Wookiees are known to do that.

559
00:58:42,198 --> 00:58:43,908
I see your point, sir.

560
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:47,077
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

561
00:59:05,805 --> 00:59:09,225
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
ﬂowing through him.

562
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:14,313
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially, but it also obeys your commands.

563
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,946
Hokey religions and
ancient weapons are no match...

564
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:23,739
for a good blaster at your side, kid.

565
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:27,117
You don’t believe in the Force, do you?

566
00:59:27,243 --> 00:59:29,524
Kid, I've flown from
one side of this galaxy to the other.

567
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,706
I've seen a lot of strange stuff,
but I've never seen anything...

568
00:59:32,832 --> 00:59:37,211
to make me believe there’s one
all-powerful force controlling everything.

569
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:41,382
There's no mystical
energy field controls my destiny.

570
00:59:41,507 --> 00:59:44,718
It's all a lot of simple
tricks and nonsense.

571
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,264
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

572
00:59:48,764 --> 00:59:51,517
This time, let go your conscious self...

573
00:59:53,644 --> 00:59:55,646
and act on instinct.

574
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,024
With the blast shield down,
I can’t even see.

575
00:59:59,149 --> 01:00:00,734
How am I supposed to ﬁght?

576
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:03,654
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

577
01:00:12,252 --> 01:00:14,379
Stretch out with your feelings.

578
01:00:29,019 --> 01:00:32,647
- You see? You can do it.
- I call it luck.

579
01:00:32,772 --> 01:00:35,400
In my experience,
there’s no such thing as luck.

580
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,864
Look, good against remotes is one thing. Good
against the living, that's something else.

581
01:00:42,365 --> 01:00:44,534
Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

582
01:00:47,287 --> 01:00:50,123
You know, I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

583
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:54,794
That’s good. You’ve taken your
first step into a larger world.

584
01:00:57,368 --> 01:01:00,747
- Yes?
- Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

585
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:02,750
They found the remains of a rebel base...

586
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,233
but they estimate that it has
been deserted for some time.

587
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:08,881
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

588
01:01:09,882 --> 01:01:11,967
She lied. She lied to us!

589
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:16,889
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

590
01:01:17,389 --> 01:01:19,767
Terminate her... immediately.

591
01:01:22,603 --> 01:01:25,481
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

592
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:29,652
What the...?

593
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:34,532
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower.

594
01:01:34,615 --> 01:01:37,493
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It's not on any of the chants.

595
01:01:37,618 --> 01:01:40,788
- What's going on?
- Our position's correct, except no Alderaan.

596
01:01:41,038 --> 01:01:43,290
- What do you mean? Where is it?
- That’s what I'm trying to tell you, kid.

597
01:01:43,415 --> 01:01:45,000
It ain’t there. It's
been totally blown away.

598
01:01:45,126 --> 01:01:47,795
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

599
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,120
The entire star fleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet.

600
01:01:50,131 --> 01:01:52,531
It would take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've-

601
01:01:53,926 --> 01:01:55,427
There’s another ship coming in.

602
01:01:55,553 --> 01:01:58,556
- Maybe they know what happened.
- It's an Imperial fighter.

603
01:01:59,932 --> 01:02:02,768
- It followed us!
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

604
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,813
There aren’t any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

605
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:10,901
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big trouble.

606
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:13,070
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

607
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:15,322
It would be as well to let it go.
It's too far out of range.

608
01:02:15,406 --> 01:02:17,199
Not for long.

609
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:23,664
A ﬁghter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

610
01:02:23,956 --> 01:02:26,458
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

611
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:29,336
Well, he ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

612
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,424
Look at him.
He's heading for that small moon.

613
01:02:33,465 --> 01:02:36,427
I think I can get him before
he gets there. He's almost in range.

614
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,972
That's no moon.

615
01:02:40,097 --> 01:02:43,475
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

616
01:02:46,854 --> 01:02:49,231
I have a very bad feeling about this.

617
01:02:49,356 --> 01:02:51,108
Turn the ship around.

618
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:55,738
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse!
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

619
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:02,453
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power!

620
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:06,498
Why are we still moving towards it?!

621
01:03:06,624 --> 01:03:08,459
We’re caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in!

622
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:11,378
- There's got to be something you can do!
- There's nothing I can do about it, kid.

623
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:15,507
I'm full power. I'm gonna have to shut down.
They're not gonna get me without a ﬁght.

624
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:22,765
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

625
01:03:39,406 --> 01:03:41,533
<i>Clear Bay 327.</i>

626
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,036
<i>We're opening the magnetic ﬁeld.</i>

627
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:01,262
To your stations! Come with me.

628
01:04:05,182 --> 01:04:08,811
<i>Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.</i>

629
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,648
<i>- Yes?
- We've captured a freighter...</i>

630
01:04:12,773 --> 01:04:14,942
<i>entering the remains
of the Alderaan system.</i>

631
01:04:15,067 --> 01:04:18,654
<i>Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.</i>

632
01:04:18,779 --> 01:04:22,283
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

633
01:04:22,408 --> 01:04:25,327
She may yet be of some use to us.

634
01:04:30,332 --> 01:04:34,044
<i>Unlock 1, 5, 7, and 9.
Release charge.</i>

635
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,965
<i>316, report to control.</i>

636
01:04:41,593 --> 01:04:43,345
There’s no one on board, sir.

637
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:46,473
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

638
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:49,435
It must be a decoy, sir. Several of the
escape pods have been jettisoned.

639
01:04:49,476 --> 01:04:51,478
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

640
01:04:51,562 --> 01:04:53,355
If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

641
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,942
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

642
01:04:56,984 --> 01:04:58,444
Yes, sir.

643
01:04:58,485 --> 01:05:02,614
I sense something...
a presence I've not felt since...

644
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:09,371
Get me a scanning crew in here on the double.
I want every part of this ship checked.

645
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:30,351
Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.

646
01:05:30,476 --> 01:05:33,645
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in ’em.

647
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:36,482
This is ridiculous.
Even if I could take off...

648
01:05:36,523 --> 01:05:39,401
- |’d never get past the tractor beam.
- Leave that to me.

649
01:05:39,526 --> 01:05:42,404
Damn fool, I knew
that you were gonna say that.

650
01:05:42,529 --> 01:05:45,991
Who’s the more foolish, the fool
or the fool who follows him?

651
01:05:55,542 --> 01:06:00,172
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

652
01:06:01,048 --> 01:06:02,674
All right, let's go.

653
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,690
Hey, down there!

654
01:06:20,818 --> 01:06:22,820
Could you give us a hand with this?

655
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:34,039
TK-421, why aren’t you at your post?

656
01:06:34,581 --> 01:06:36,708
TK-421, do you copy?

657
01:06:49,096 --> 01:06:52,474
Take over. We’ve got a bad
transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

658
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,743
You know, between his howling
and your blasting everything in sight...

659
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:14,147
it’s a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we’re here.

660
01:07:14,204 --> 01:07:17,332
Bring ’em on! I'd prefer a straight fight
to all this sneakin’ around.

661
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:19,126
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

662
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:22,379
Plug in. He should be able to interpret
the entire Imperial network.

663
01:07:33,515 --> 01:07:37,269
He says he’s found the main controls to the
power beam that's holding the ship here.

664
01:07:37,394 --> 01:07:40,022
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

665
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,410
I don’t think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

666
01:07:53,494 --> 01:07:56,997
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

667
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,290
I want to go with you.

668
01:07:58,415 --> 01:08:00,751
Be patient, Luke.
Stay and watch over the droids.

669
01:08:00,792 --> 01:08:03,045
- But he can-
- They must be delivered safely...

670
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:06,173
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

671
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:09,927
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

672
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:16,934
The Force will be with you...
always.

673
01:08:26,318 --> 01:08:31,448
You said it, Chewie.
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

674
01:08:32,282 --> 01:08:33,825
Ben is a great man.

675
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:36,991
- Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

676
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:39,665
Well, anything’s better than just hangin’
around waiting for ’em to pick us up.

677
01:08:39,706 --> 01:08:41,667
Who do you think-

678
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:45,712
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

679
01:08:45,796 --> 01:08:48,549
He says “I've found her”
and keeps repeating “She's here.”

680
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:51,343
Well, who... who has he found?

681
01:08:51,468 --> 01:08:53,845
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She’s here?!

682
01:08:53,929 --> 01:08:55,722
- Princess?!
- Where? Where is she?

683
01:08:55,847 --> 01:08:57,849
Princess?! What's going on?

684
01:09:02,813 --> 01:09:06,275
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

685
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:13,699
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

686
01:09:13,824 --> 01:09:16,326
Oh, no! We’ve got to do something!

687
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:18,954
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

688
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:21,081
She’s the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

689
01:09:21,164 --> 01:09:23,959
Now look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right here.

690
01:09:24,084 --> 01:09:27,421
But he didn't know she was here. Just find
a way back into that detention block.

691
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:29,965
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They’re going to execute her.

692
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:32,342
Look, a few minutes ago, you said you didn't
want to just wait here to be captured.

693
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:33,969
Now all you want to do is stay?

694
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:36,414
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

695
01:09:36,430 --> 01:09:39,933
- But they’re gonna kill her!
- Better her than me!

696
01:09:47,733 --> 01:09:49,610
She's rich.

697
01:09:51,737 --> 01:09:54,364
- Rich?
- Mm-hmm. Rich, powerful.

698
01:09:54,448 --> 01:09:57,492
Listen, if you were to rescue her,
the reward would be...

699
01:09:57,618 --> 01:10:00,579
- What?
- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

700
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:03,624
- I don’t know. I can imagine quite a bit.
- You'll get it.

701
01:10:03,749 --> 01:10:05,959
- I better.
- You will.

702
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,587
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

703
01:10:08,629 --> 01:10:10,464
- All right.
- What's your plan?

704
01:10:10,589 --> 01:10:11,965
Uh...

705
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,509
3P0, hand me those binders there,
will you?

706
01:10:15,886 --> 01:10:17,888
<i>(may...</i>

707
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,265
Now... I'm gonna put these on you.

708
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,395
Okay Han, you... you put those on.

709
01:10:25,479 --> 01:10:28,148
Don’t worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

710
01:10:28,649 --> 01:10:30,734
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

711
01:10:30,776 --> 01:10:33,987
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

712
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:37,532
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

713
01:10:37,616 --> 01:10:39,618
That isn't very reassuring.

714
01:11:00,013 --> 01:11:03,934
<i>517 to scanner control.
517 to scanner control.</i>

715
01:11:08,188 --> 01:11:10,440
<i>316, report to control.</i>

716
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:17,906
<i>53 to upper bay door.
53 to upper bay door.</i>

717
01:11:31,211 --> 01:11:33,797
I can’t see a thing in this helmet.

718
01:12:04,703 --> 01:12:07,247
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

719
01:12:07,372 --> 01:12:09,624
I did say so before.

720
01:12:24,723 --> 01:12:27,642
Where are you taking this... thing?

721
01:12:27,768 --> 01:12:30,520
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

722
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:35,776
I wasn't notified.
I'll have to clear it.

723
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,534
- Look out! He’s loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

724
01:12:44,659 --> 01:12:46,286
I'll get him!

725
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,936
Look out!

726
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,031
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

727
01:13:23,156 --> 01:13:27,202
Here it is... 2187. You go and get her.
I'll hold them here.

728
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:34,459
Uh, everything’s under control.
Situation normal. — What happened?

729
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:39,673
Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction, but,
uh, everything’s perfectly all right now.

730
01:13:39,714 --> 01:13:44,219
We're fine... We're all fine here now.
Thank you. How are you?

731
01:13:44,344 --> 01:13:45,846
<i>We're sending a squad up.</i>

732
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:49,975
Uh, negative, negative!
We have a... a reactor leak here, uh, now.

733
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,562
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Uh, large leak, very dangerous.

734
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:56,314
<i>Who is this? What's your
operating number?</i>

735
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:57,941
Uh...

736
01:13:58,859 --> 01:14:02,988
Boring conversation anyway...
Luke! We're gonna have company!

737
01:14:16,376 --> 01:14:18,712
Aren’t you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

738
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:21,590
Huh? Oh, the uniform.

739
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:25,260
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

740
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,012
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you.

741
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,014
I’ve got your R2 unit.
I'm here with Ben Kenobi.

742
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,641
- Ben Kenobi?! Where is he?
- Come on!

743
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:37,355
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

744
01:14:37,397 --> 01:14:40,734
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

745
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:44,863
The last time I felt it was
in the presence of my old master.

746
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:47,407
Surely he must be dead by now.

747
01:14:47,532 --> 01:14:50,410
Don’t underestimate the Force.

748
01:14:50,493 --> 01:14:54,748
The Jedi are extinct.
Their ﬁre has gone out of the universe.

749
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:58,251
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

750
01:14:58,376 --> 01:14:59,794
Yes.

751
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,506
<i>We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.</i>

752
01:15:03,882 --> 01:15:06,426
The princess?
Put all sections on alert.

753
01:15:06,551 --> 01:15:10,138
Obi-Wan is here.
The Force is with him.

754
01:15:10,263 --> 01:15:12,807
If you're right, he must not be
allowed to escape.

755
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:16,686
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

756
01:15:25,946 --> 01:15:27,697
Get behind me! Get behind me!

757
01:15:38,959 --> 01:15:41,711
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

758
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:45,548
Can’t get out that way.

759
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:47,342
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

760
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:50,595
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

761
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,599
- C-3P0, C-3P0!
- Yes, sir?

762
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:58,228
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off!

763
01:16:00,814 --> 01:16:03,066
What was that? I didn’t copy.

764
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:06,486
I said all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir.

765
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:08,697
The main entrance seems
to be the only way in or out.

766
01:16:08,822 --> 01:16:11,116
All other information
on your level is restricted.

767
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,618
Open up in there! Open up in there!

768
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:16,621
Oh, no!

769
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:18,873
There isn’t any other way out!

770
01:16:23,878 --> 01:16:25,964
I can't hold them off forever!
Now what?!

771
01:16:26,006 --> 01:16:29,759
This is some rescue! You came in here,
and you didn't have a plan for getting out?

772
01:16:29,884 --> 01:16:33,388
- He's the brains, sweetheart!
- Well, I didn’t...

773
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:38,643
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

774
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:43,023
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

775
01:16:49,612 --> 01:16:51,406
Get in there!

776
01:16:52,032 --> 01:16:55,285
Get in there, you big furry oaf!
I don't care what you smell.

777
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:58,288
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

778
01:17:00,915 --> 01:17:03,001
Wonderful girl!

779
01:17:04,044 --> 01:17:07,672
Either I'm going to kill her
or I'm beginning to like her.

780
01:17:08,798 --> 01:17:10,675
Get in there!

781
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:26,191
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

782
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:29,819
What an incredible smell
you’ve discovered!

783
01:17:32,405 --> 01:17:34,199
Let's get out of here.

784
01:17:34,324 --> 01:17:37,077
- Get away from there.
- No, wait!

785
01:17:43,083 --> 01:17:45,919
Will you forget it? I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

786
01:17:46,044 --> 01:17:48,463
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

787
01:17:48,588 --> 01:17:50,090
Absolutely, Your Worship.

788
01:17:50,215 --> 01:17:53,093
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here!

789
01:17:53,176 --> 01:17:55,595
You know, it’s not gonna take ’em long
to figure out what happened to us!

790
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:57,722
It could be worse.

791
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:04,562
- It's worse.
- There’s something alive in here.

792
01:18:04,604 --> 01:18:09,359
- That’s your imagination.
- Something just moved past my leg.

793
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,612
Look! Did you see that?

794
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:14,739
What?

795
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:37,095
Kid! Luke!

796
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:42,475
Luke!

797
01:18:47,147 --> 01:18:51,526
Luke! Luke, grab hold of this!

798
01:18:51,901 --> 01:18:53,987
Blast it, will you?
My gun's jammed.

799
01:18:54,112 --> 01:18:57,157
- Where?
- Anywhere!

800
01:19:04,664 --> 01:19:06,291
Luke, Luke!

801
01:19:29,314 --> 01:19:32,066
Help him! What happened?

802
01:19:32,192 --> 01:19:36,154
I don't know. It just let go of me
and disappeared.

803
01:19:42,076 --> 01:19:44,579
I got a bad feeling about this.

804
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:50,960
The walls are moving!

805
01:19:51,044 --> 01:19:54,339
Don’t just stand there!
Try and brace it with something.

806
01:20:02,055 --> 01:20:03,973
Help me!

807
01:20:16,736 --> 01:20:18,488
Wait a minute!

808
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:24,827
3P0! Come in, 3P0!

809
01:20:24,869 --> 01:20:28,373
<i>3P0! Where could he be?</i>

810
01:20:32,752 --> 01:20:35,004
Take over. See to him.

811
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:39,008
Look, there.

812
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:42,595
They're madmen!

813
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,265
They’re heading for the prison level.
If you hurry, you might catch them.

814
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:47,225
Follow me.

815
01:20:50,603 --> 01:20:52,605
You stand guard.

816
01:20:57,402 --> 01:20:59,737
Come on.

817
01:21:02,407 --> 01:21:03,616
Oh!

818
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:10,039
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

819
01:21:10,123 --> 01:21:13,167
If you don’t mind, I'd like to take him
down to maintenance.

820
01:21:13,293 --> 01:21:15,795
All right.

821
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:29,934
3P0! Come in, 3P0!

822
01:21:30,059 --> 01:21:31,436
3P0!

823
01:21:31,561 --> 01:21:34,063
- Get on top!
- I can't!

824
01:21:34,147 --> 01:21:39,444
Where could he be?! 3P0!
3P0, will you come in!

825
01:21:39,694 --> 01:21:42,071
They aren’t here. Something
must have happened to them.

826
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:44,907
See if they've been captured.
Hurry!

827
01:21:48,661 --> 01:21:51,456
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

828
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:56,961
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

829
01:22:02,175 --> 01:22:05,345
Thank goodness they haven’t found them!
Where could they be?

830
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:09,098
Use the comlink?

831
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:12,310
Oh, my. I forgot.
I turned it off.

832
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,357
Are you there, sir?

833
01:22:17,482 --> 01:22:18,983
3P0?!

834
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:21,861
- We've <i>had some problems.</i>
<i>- Will you shut up and listen to me?!</i>

835
01:22:21,986 --> 01:22:24,864
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level, will ya?!

836
01:22:24,989 --> 01:22:27,992
Do you copy? Shut down all the garbage
mashers on the detention level!

837
01:22:29,952 --> 01:22:32,497
<i>Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!</i>

838
01:22:32,622 --> 01:22:35,124
No! Shut them all down. Hurry!

839
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:49,639
What?

840
01:22:51,474 --> 01:22:54,018
Listen to them.
They're dying, R2!

841
01:22:54,143 --> 01:22:59,148
Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast enough.
It's all my fault! My poor master.

842
01:22:59,273 --> 01:23:03,986
We’re all right! You did great! Hey!
Open the pressure maintenance hatch...

843
01:23:04,028 --> 01:23:08,866
on unit number... where are we?
3263827!

844
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,708
If we can just avoid any more female advice,
we ought to be able to get outta here.

845
01:23:58,791 --> 01:24:01,919
Well, let's get moving.

846
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:03,713
Where are you going?

847
01:24:04,213 --> 01:24:06,591
No, wait! They'll hear!

848
01:24:07,967 --> 01:24:10,470
Come here, you big coward.
Chewie, come here.

849
01:24:10,595 --> 01:24:11,971
Listen...

850
01:24:12,096 --> 01:24:14,974
I don’t know who you are
or where you came from...

851
01:24:15,099 --> 01:24:17,977
but from now on, you do
as I tell you, okay?

852
01:24:18,811 --> 01:24:21,731
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

853
01:24:21,814 --> 01:24:24,984
I take orders from just one person... me!

854
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:27,111
It's a wonder you're still alive.

855
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:30,364
Will somebody get this big
walking carpet out of my way?

856
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:32,950
No reward is worth this!

857
01:24:42,752 --> 01:24:46,214
- Give me regular reports, please.
- Right.

858
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,260
- Do you know what’s going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

859
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:58,351
You seen that new VT-16?

860
01:24:58,392 --> 01:25:00,603
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

861
01:25:00,645 --> 01:25:02,605
They say it's... it's quite a thing to see.

862
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:05,149
What was that?

863
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:07,902
Ah, it's nothing. Outgassing.
Don’t worry about it.

864
01:25:13,282 --> 01:25:15,660
- There she is.
- C-3P0? Do you copy?

865
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:17,161
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

866
01:25:17,286 --> 01:25:18,871
<i>- Ne you safe?
- For the moment.</i>

867
01:25:18,996 --> 01:25:21,290
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

868
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:26,504
- We’re right above you. Stand by.
- You came in that thing?!

869
01:25:26,546 --> 01:25:29,298
- You're braver than I thought!
- Nice! Come on.

870
01:25:33,427 --> 01:25:35,179
It's them! Blast them!

871
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:39,058
- Get back to the ship!
- Where are you going? Come back!

872
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:42,061
- He certainly has courage.
- What good will it do us if he gets himself killed?

873
01:25:42,186 --> 01:25:43,688
Come on.

874
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:11,173
I think we took a wrong turn.

875
01:26:15,678 --> 01:26:17,346
There's no lock!

876
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:23,686
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick! We’ve got to get across.

877
01:26:23,728 --> 01:26:27,064
- Find the controls that extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

878
01:26:27,106 --> 01:26:29,066
They're coming through!

879
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,757
Here, hold this.

880
01:27:09,148 --> 01:27:10,900
Here they come.

881
01:27:21,494 --> 01:27:23,162
For luck.

882
01:27:29,001 --> 01:27:33,923
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

883
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:49,939
Where could they be?

884
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,954
Open the blast doors!
Open the blast doors!

885
01:28:23,318 --> 01:28:27,614
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

886
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,825
The circle is now complete.

887
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:35,371
When I left you, I was but the learner.
Now I am the master.

888
01:28:35,497 --> 01:28:38,208
Only a master of evil, Darth.

889
01:28:57,519 --> 01:29:00,271
Your powers are weak, old man.

890
01:29:00,396 --> 01:29:04,025
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

891
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:07,529
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

892
01:29:14,661 --> 01:29:16,996
You should not have come back.

893
01:29:42,564 --> 01:29:45,525
Didn’t we just leave this party?

894
01:29:46,943 --> 01:29:49,404
- What kept you?
- We, uh, ran into some old friends.

895
01:29:49,445 --> 01:29:51,948
- The ship all right?
- It seems okay, if we can get to it.

896
01:29:52,073 --> 01:29:54,826
I just hope the old man got
the tractor beam out of commission.

897
01:30:08,965 --> 01:30:10,466
Look!

898
01:30:13,344 --> 01:30:15,847
Come on, R2, we're going.

899
01:30:16,723 --> 01:30:18,725
Now’s our chance! Go!

900
01:30:21,978 --> 01:30:23,479
Ben?

901
01:30:38,119 --> 01:30:39,621
No!

902
01:30:48,254 --> 01:30:51,257
- Come on!
- Come on! Come on!

903
01:30:51,758 --> 01:30:55,261
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

904
01:31:04,646 --> 01:31:07,023
<i>Run, Luke, run!</i>

905
01:31:09,776 --> 01:31:11,861
I hope that old man got that
tractor beam out of commission...

906
01:31:11,986 --> 01:31:15,114
or this is gonna be a real short trip.
Okay, hit it!

907
01:31:46,145 --> 01:31:48,690
We’re coming up on their sentry ships.
Hold them off.

908
01:31:48,815 --> 01:31:51,651
Angle the deflector shields
while I charge up the main guns.

909
01:32:00,702 --> 01:32:02,787
I can't believe he’s gone.

910
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:08,710
There wasn't anything
you could have done.

911
01:32:09,210 --> 01:32:11,671
Come on, buddy.
We’re not out of this yet.

912
01:32:28,062 --> 01:32:30,815
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

913
01:32:41,367 --> 01:32:43,119
Here they come.

914
01:33:00,344 --> 01:33:02,346
They're coming in too fast!

915
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:14,484
- We've lost the lateral controls!
- Don't worry. She’ll hold together.

916
01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:17,987
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

917
01:33:39,675 --> 01:33:43,930
- Got him! I got him!
- Great, kid! Don’t get cocky.

918
01:33:45,139 --> 01:33:47,058
There’s still two more of them out there!

919
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:24,303
- That’s it! We did it!
- We did it!

920
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:27,348
Help! I think I'm melting!
This is all your fault!

921
01:34:34,856 --> 01:34:36,482
Are they away?

922
01:34:36,566 --> 01:34:39,610
They’ve just made the jump
into hyperspace.

923
01:34:39,735 --> 01:34:43,948
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

924
01:34:44,073 --> 01:34:48,619
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
This had better work.

925
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:51,372
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

926
01:34:51,497 --> 01:34:54,959
You know, sometimes
I amaze even myself.

927
01:34:55,001 --> 01:34:57,211
That doesn’t sound too hard.

928
01:34:57,336 --> 01:35:01,132
They let us go. It's the only explanation
for the ease of our escape.

929
01:35:01,257 --> 01:35:03,885
- Easy? You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

930
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:06,012
Not this ship, sister.

931
01:35:06,971 --> 01:35:09,515
At least the information
in R2 is still intact.

932
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:14,520
- What’s so important? What’s he carrying?
- The technical readouts of that battle station.

933
01:35:15,521 --> 01:35:18,733
I only hope that when the data's analyzed,
a weakness can be found.

934
01:35:18,774 --> 01:35:21,986
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

935
01:35:22,028 --> 01:35:25,406
Look, I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

936
01:35:25,531 --> 01:35:28,492
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

937
01:35:28,534 --> 01:35:30,494
You needn’t worry about your reward.

938
01:35:30,536 --> 01:35:33,998
If money is all that you love,
then that’s what you'll receive.

939
01:35:36,918 --> 01:35:40,922
Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder
if he really cares about anything...

940
01:35:41,047 --> 01:35:43,049
or anybody.

941
01:35:43,174 --> 01:35:44,800
I care!

942
01:35:51,182 --> 01:35:52,892
So...

943
01:35:53,559 --> 01:35:57,313
- What do you think of her, Han?
- I'm trying not to, kid.

944
01:35:58,064 --> 01:35:59,690
Good.

945
01:36:02,818 --> 01:36:05,780
Still, she’s got a lot of spirit.

946
01:36:07,573 --> 01:36:10,576
I don't know. What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me-

947
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:12,536
No.

948
01:36:59,083 --> 01:37:02,253
You're safe. When we heard about Alderaan,
we feared the worst.

949
01:37:02,378 --> 01:37:06,090
We have no time for sorrows, Commander. You
must use the information in this R2 unit...

950
01:37:06,132 --> 01:37:09,010
to help plan the attack.
It's our only hope.

951
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:33,284
<i>- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.</i>

952
01:37:33,367 --> 01:37:38,289
<i>The rebel base is on a moon on the far
side. We are preparing to omit the planet.</i>

953
01:37:46,505 --> 01:37:50,676
The battle station is heavily shielded,
and carries a firepower...

954
01:37:50,760 --> 01:37:53,012
greater than half the star fleet.

955
01:37:53,054 --> 01:37:57,433
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

956
01:37:57,558 --> 01:38:02,813
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

957
01:38:04,190 --> 01:38:07,943
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub ﬁghters going to be against that?

958
01:38:08,069 --> 01:38:11,447
Well, the Empire doesn't consider
a small, one-man fighter...

959
01:38:11,572 --> 01:38:15,076
to be any threat,
or they'd have a tighter defense.

960
01:38:15,451 --> 01:38:18,704
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

961
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:22,333
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

962
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:25,169
The approach will not be easy.

963
01:38:25,211 --> 01:38:28,422
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

964
01:38:28,547 --> 01:38:31,342
and skim the surface to this point.

965
01:38:31,717 --> 01:38:34,720
The target area is only two meters wide.

966
01:38:34,804 --> 01:38:39,600
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

967
01:38:39,725 --> 01:38:42,853
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

968
01:38:42,937 --> 01:38:47,942
A precise hit will start a chain reaction
which should destroy the station.

969
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:51,612
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

970
01:38:51,737 --> 01:38:54,949
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

971
01:38:54,990 --> 01:38:58,119
- That's impossible, even for a computer.
- It's not impossible.

972
01:38:58,202 --> 01:39:00,746
I used to bull's-eye womp rats
in my T-16 back home.

973
01:39:00,830 --> 01:39:02,873
They're not much bigger than two meters.

974
01:39:03,332 --> 01:39:07,086
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

975
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,513
<i>Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.</i>

976
01:39:18,013 --> 01:39:22,017
<i>The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.</i>

977
01:39:22,143 --> 01:39:26,647
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

978
01:39:26,772 --> 01:39:31,277
and will soon see the end
of the rebellion.

979
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:37,908
<i>All ﬂight crews, man your stations.</i>

980
01:39:38,659 --> 01:39:41,620
<i>All ﬂight crews, man your stations.</i>

981
01:39:43,914 --> 01:39:46,792
So... you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

982
01:39:46,917 --> 01:39:48,752
That's right. Yeah.

983
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:52,548
I got some old debts I got
to pay off with this stuff.

984
01:39:52,673 --> 01:39:56,802
And even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do you?

985
01:39:57,178 --> 01:40:00,764
Why don't you come with us? You're
pretty good in a fight. We could use you.

986
01:40:00,806 --> 01:40:03,767
Come on. Why don't you
take a look around?

987
01:40:03,809 --> 01:40:06,187
You know what’s about to happen,
what they're up against.

988
01:40:06,312 --> 01:40:09,523
They could use a good pilot like you.
You’re turning your back on them.

989
01:40:09,565 --> 01:40:12,026
What good’s a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

990
01:40:12,067 --> 01:40:14,820
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

991
01:40:14,945 --> 01:40:17,948
It's more like... suicide.

992
01:40:19,450 --> 01:40:22,328
All right.
Take care of yourself, Han.

993
01:40:22,453 --> 01:40:25,414
I guess that's what
you’re best at, isn’t it?

994
01:40:25,539 --> 01:40:27,208
Hey, Luke.

995
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,588
May the Force be with you.

996
01:40:38,844 --> 01:40:42,223
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

997
01:40:46,352 --> 01:40:51,357
<i>All pilots t0 your stations.
All pilots to your stations.</i>

998
01:40:57,446 --> 01:40:59,365
- What's wrong?
- Oh, it's Han.

999
01:40:59,823 --> 01:41:02,618
I don't know. I really thought
he'd change his mind.

1000
01:41:02,743 --> 01:41:06,497
He’s got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1001
01:41:07,206 --> 01:41:09,708
I only wish Ben were here.

1002
01:41:17,758 --> 01:41:20,010
<i>Open main launch tubes.</i>

1003
01:41:21,637 --> 01:41:24,515
<i>Main launch tubes opening, sir.</i>

1004
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:32,898
Hey, this R2 unit of yours seems a bit
beat up. You want a new one?

1005
01:41:32,982 --> 01:41:35,942
Not on your life. That little droid and I
have been through a lot together.

1006
01:41:36,026 --> 01:41:37,903
You okay, R2?

1007
01:41:38,654 --> 01:41:40,155
Good.

1008
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:43,909
<i>Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.</i>

1009
01:41:44,368 --> 01:41:47,037
Hang on tight, R2.
You’ve got to come back.

1010
01:41:49,164 --> 01:41:51,417
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1011
01:42:40,049 --> 01:42:43,969
<i>Luke, the Force will be with you.</i>

1012
01:42:54,730 --> 01:42:57,691
<i>Standby alert.
Death Star approaching.</i>

1013
01:42:58,233 --> 01:43:01,445
<i>Estimated time to ﬁring range, 15 minutes.</i>

1014
01:43:14,375 --> 01:43:16,627
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1015
01:43:16,752 --> 01:43:18,879
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.

1016
01:43:19,004 --> 01:43:21,757
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.

1017
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:24,218
- Red Two standing by.
- Red <i>11</i> standing by.

1018
01:43:24,259 --> 01:43:26,220
Red Five standing by.

1019
01:43:27,388 --> 01:43:30,015
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1020
01:43:33,394 --> 01:43:36,730
<i>We 're passing through their
magnetic ﬁeld.</i> - <i>Hold</i> tight.

1021
01:43:36,772 --> 01:43:40,484
<i>Switch your deﬂectors on.
Double front.</i>

1022
01:43:42,903 --> 01:43:45,781
- Look at the size of that thing!
- Cut the chatter, Red Two.

1023
01:43:45,864 --> 01:43:47,908
Accelerate to attack speed.

1024
01:43:50,744 --> 01:43:53,414
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1025
01:43:53,539 --> 01:43:56,625
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft now.

1026
01:43:56,667 --> 01:44:00,546
We're in position. I'm going to cut across
the axis and try and draw their ﬁre.

1027
01:44:14,643 --> 01:44:18,021
<i>- Heavy ﬁre, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.</i>

1028
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:27,573
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1029
01:44:31,452 --> 01:44:33,328
<i>Luke, pull UP!</i>

1030
01:44:34,163 --> 01:44:36,832
- Are you all right?
- I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

1031
01:44:42,463 --> 01:44:44,214
We count 30 rebel ships, Lord Vader...

1032
01:44:44,339 --> 01:44:46,419
but they’re so small
they’re evading our turbo lasers.

1033
01:44:46,425 --> 01:44:50,471
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.
Get the crews to their fighters.

1034
01:44:52,931 --> 01:44:57,436
Watch yourself. There’s a lot of ﬁre coming
from the right side of that deﬂection tower.

1035
01:44:57,478 --> 01:45:00,230
- I'm on it.
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.

1036
01:45:00,355 --> 01:45:02,691
I'm right with you, Red Three.

1037
01:45:07,946 --> 01:45:09,740
I've got a problem here.

1038
01:45:09,842 --> 01:45:11,386
- Eject!
- I can hold it.

1039
01:45:11,511 --> 01:45:13,888
- Pull up!
- No, no, I'm all-

1040
01:45:17,850 --> 01:45:20,853
<i>The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.</i>

1041
01:45:24,649 --> 01:45:27,860
<i>Luke, trust your feelings.</i>

1042
01:45:35,368 --> 01:45:39,163
Squad leaders, we’ve
picked up a new group of signals.

1043
01:45:39,288 --> 01:45:41,040
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1044
01:45:41,165 --> 01:45:42,917
My scope’s negative.
I don't see anything.

1045
01:45:43,042 --> 01:45:45,503
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.

1046
01:45:48,131 --> 01:45:50,425
Watch it. You've got one on your tail.

1047
01:45:55,304 --> 01:45:56,889
I'm hit!

1048
01:45:57,640 --> 01:46:00,685
- You've picked one up! Watch it!
- I can’t see it!

1049
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:04,564
He's on me tight.
I can’t shake him!

1050
01:46:05,815 --> 01:46:07,692
I'll be right there.

1051
01:46:19,829 --> 01:46:23,708
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1052
01:46:26,669 --> 01:46:29,172
<i>Pull in! Luke, pull in!</i>

1053
01:46:29,297 --> 01:46:33,092
Watch your back, Luke. Watch your back.
Fighters above you, coming in.

1054
01:46:38,681 --> 01:46:41,350
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1055
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:43,603
Hang on back there.

1056
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:46,355
<i>Red Six, can you see Red Five?</i>

1057
01:46:46,439 --> 01:46:49,192
<i>There's a heavy ﬁre zone...
Red Five, where are you?</i>

1058
01:46:49,317 --> 01:46:50,985
I can’t shake him!

1059
01:46:54,322 --> 01:46:56,240
I'm on him, Luke. Hold on.

1060
01:46:58,993 --> 01:47:01,120
Blast it, Biggs! Where are you?

1061
01:47:08,211 --> 01:47:10,630
<i>- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.</i>

1062
01:47:10,713 --> 01:47:14,133
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We’re starting our attack run.

1063
01:47:15,593 --> 01:47:18,387
<i>I copy, Gold Leader.
Move into position.</i>

1064
01:47:20,515 --> 01:47:22,892
Stay in attack formation.

1065
01:47:22,975 --> 01:47:26,020
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1066
01:47:31,526 --> 01:47:34,529
<i>Switch all power to front deﬂector screens.</i>

1067
01:47:34,612 --> 01:47:37,615
<i>Switch all power to front deﬂector screens.</i>

1068
01:47:42,537 --> 01:47:44,539
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1069
01:47:44,622 --> 01:47:47,667
<i>Say about 20 guns. Some on the surface,
some on the towers.</i>

1070
01:47:47,750 --> 01:47:50,753
<i>Death Star will be in range in ﬁve minutes.</i>

1071
01:47:52,797 --> 01:47:55,007
Switch to targeting computer.

1072
01:47:58,302 --> 01:48:00,763
Computer locked.
Getting a signal.

1073
01:48:02,765 --> 01:48:05,268
The guns! They’ve stopped!

1074
01:48:06,435 --> 01:48:09,146
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy ﬁghters.

1075
01:48:09,188 --> 01:48:12,066
They're coming in!
Three marks at 210.

1076
01:48:13,693 --> 01:48:17,196
- I'll take them myself. Cover me.
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:48:31,419 --> 01:48:34,046
- It's no good. I can’t maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1078
01:48:34,088 --> 01:48:36,549
- We’re too close.
- Stay on target.

1079
01:48:37,967 --> 01:48:39,719
Loosen up!

1080
01:48:41,846 --> 01:48:44,724
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1081
01:48:44,807 --> 01:48:47,560
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1082
01:48:53,441 --> 01:48:56,235
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1083
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:58,195
Should I have your ship standing by?

1084
01:48:58,321 --> 01:49:03,701
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?
I think you overestimate their chances.

1085
01:49:04,243 --> 01:49:06,871
<i>Rebel base, three minutes and closing.</i>

1086
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:10,958
Red boys, this is Red Leader.
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1087
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,712
<i>- This is Red Two ﬂying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.</i>

1088
01:49:14,837 --> 01:49:16,505
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1089
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:19,008
<i>Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.</i>

1090
01:49:19,133 --> 01:49:21,761
<i>Copy, Base One. Luke,
take Red Two and Three.</i>

1091
01:49:21,886 --> 01:49:25,139
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1092
01:49:34,023 --> 01:49:35,775
This is it!

1093
01:49:39,528 --> 01:49:41,614
We should be able to see it by now.

1094
01:49:43,115 --> 01:49:45,618
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1095
01:49:46,869 --> 01:49:49,372
There's too much interference. Red Five,
can you see them from where you are?

1096
01:49:49,497 --> 01:49:52,917
- No sign of any... Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1097
01:49:53,918 --> 01:49:55,670
I'm in range.

1098
01:49:56,295 --> 01:49:58,172
Target’s coming up.

1099
01:50:00,675 --> 01:50:03,052
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1100
01:50:03,427 --> 01:50:05,680
Close up formation.

1101
01:50:07,014 --> 01:50:09,183
Almost there.

1102
01:50:17,650 --> 01:50:21,529
- You’d better let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1103
01:50:22,321 --> 01:50:24,198
I can't hold them.

1104
01:50:32,331 --> 01:50:34,041
It's away!

1105
01:50:37,545 --> 01:50:38,963
<i>- It's a hit!
- Negative.</i>

1106
01:50:39,088 --> 01:50:41,549
Negative. It didn't go in.

1107
01:50:41,590 --> 01:50:44,593
<i>It just impacted on the surface.</i>

1108
01:50:50,349 --> 01:50:54,812
Red Leader, we're right above you.
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1109
01:50:54,937 --> 01:50:58,232
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1110
01:50:58,607 --> 01:51:01,068
Get set up for your attack run.

1111
01:51:13,873 --> 01:51:17,001
<i>Rebel base, one minute and closing.</i>

1112
01:51:17,126 --> 01:51:20,629
<i>Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.
We're going in full throttle.</i>

1113
01:51:20,755 --> 01:51:24,467
- That ought to keep those ﬁghters off our back.
- Right with you, boss.

1114
01:51:24,592 --> 01:51:27,094
Luke, at that speed, will you be able
to pull out in time?

1115
01:51:27,136 --> 01:51:29,513
It'll be just like
Beggar's Canyon back home.

1116
01:51:36,228 --> 01:51:38,481
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1117
01:51:38,522 --> 01:51:41,233
<i>My scope shows the tower,
but I can’t see the exhaust port.</i>

1118
01:51:41,275 --> 01:51:43,736
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1119
01:51:46,155 --> 01:51:49,784
- Watch yourself. Increase speed, full throttle.
- What about that tower?

1120
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:52,661
You worry about those fighters!
<i>I'll</i> worry about the tower!

1121
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:02,421
R2, that stabilizer’s broken loose again.
See if you can’t lock it down.

1122
01:52:11,514 --> 01:52:13,641
Fighters coming in .3.

1123
01:52:22,024 --> 01:52:23,818
I'm hit! I can’t stay with you!

1124
01:52:23,901 --> 01:52:26,153
Get clear, Wedge.
You can't do any more good back there.

1125
01:52:26,195 --> 01:52:27,822
<i>Sorry.</i>

1126
01:52:28,405 --> 01:52:30,658
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1127
01:52:32,910 --> 01:52:35,913
Hurry, Luke. They’re coming in much faster
this time. We can't hold them.

1128
01:52:39,416 --> 01:52:41,544
R2, try and increase the power.

1129
01:52:47,716 --> 01:52:50,469
<i>Hurry up, Luke! Wait! Quick!</i>

1130
01:52:57,726 --> 01:53:00,604
<i>Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.</i>

1131
01:53:00,729 --> 01:53:02,690
I'm on the leader.

1132
01:53:05,359 --> 01:53:06,986
Hang on, R2.

1133
01:53:22,501 --> 01:53:24,879
<i>Use the Force, Luke.</i>

1134
01:53:27,756 --> 01:53:29,758
<i>Let go, Luke.</i>

1135
01:53:31,468 --> 01:53:33,762
The Force is strong with this one.

1136
01:53:33,888 --> 01:53:36,015
<i>Luke, trust me.</i>

1137
01:53:41,145 --> 01:53:42,521
<i>His computer's off.</i>

1138
01:53:42,646 --> 01:53:45,232
<i>Luke, you switched off your
targeting computer! What's wrong?</i>

1139
01:53:45,274 --> 01:53:47,276
<i>Nothing. I'm all right.</i>

1140
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:02,666
<i>I've lost R2!</i>

1141
01:54:03,792 --> 01:54:05,753
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1142
01:54:06,128 --> 01:54:08,047
<i>The Death Star has cleared the planet.</i>

1143
01:54:09,131 --> 01:54:13,135
- <i>Rebel</i> base <i>in</i> range.
- You may ﬁre when ready.

1144
01:54:13,677 --> 01:54:15,679
<i>Commence primary ignition.</i>

1145
01:54:29,318 --> 01:54:31,195
I have you now.

1146
01:54:32,947 --> 01:54:34,573
- What?
- Yahoo!

1147
01:54:36,825 --> 01:54:38,577
Look out!

1148
01:54:44,458 --> 01:54:47,795
You're all clear, kid!
Now let's blow this thing and go home!

1149
01:54:54,301 --> 01:54:55,844
<i>Stand by.</i>

1150
01:54:59,056 --> 01:55:00,599
<i>Stand by.</i>

1151
01:55:10,609 --> 01:55:12,987
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1152
01:55:13,946 --> 01:55:18,117
<i>Remember, the Force
will be with you always.</i>

1153
01:55:37,636 --> 01:55:39,138
Luke!

1154
01:55:42,516 --> 01:55:43,892
Hey! Hey!

1155
01:55:44,018 --> 01:55:45,644
I knew you'd come back.
I just knew it.

1156
01:55:45,769 --> 01:55:47,771
Well, I wasn't going to let you get
all the credit and take all the reward.

1157
01:55:47,896 --> 01:55:50,899
Hey, I knew there was
more to you than money.

1158
01:55:51,483 --> 01:55:55,029
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1159
01:55:55,529 --> 01:55:58,407
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1160
01:55:58,532 --> 01:56:01,910
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1161
01:56:01,994 --> 01:56:04,996
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, <i>I'll</i> gladly donate them.

1162
01:56:04,997 --> 01:56:07,041
He'll be all right.

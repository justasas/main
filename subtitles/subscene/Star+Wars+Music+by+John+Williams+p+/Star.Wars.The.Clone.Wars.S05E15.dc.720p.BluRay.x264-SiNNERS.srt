192

However, he is not
their anointed leader yet.

193
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,042
There is still time for us to put in place
a leader under our control.

By placing us in prison,

Vizsla has unwittingly put us in reach

Vizsla has imprisoned the Duchess here.

Vizsla is a soldier.

And like every soldier,
he is bound by honor.

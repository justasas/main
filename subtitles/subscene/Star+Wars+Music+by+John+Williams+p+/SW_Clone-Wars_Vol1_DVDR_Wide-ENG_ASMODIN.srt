0
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:10,019
Like fire, across the galaxy,
the Clone War spread.

1
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:27,933
In league with
the wicked Count Dooku...

2
01:07:28,024 --> 01:07:30,902
more and more planets slip.

3
01:07:49,584 --> 01:07:52,052
Against this threat
upon theJedi knights...

4
01:07:52,144 --> 01:07:56,581
falls the duty to lead
the newly formed army of the Republic.

5
01:07:56,664 --> 01:08:01,135
And as the heat of war grows,
so too grows the prowess...

6
01:08:01,224 --> 01:08:04,694
of one most gifted student
of the Force.

7
01:08:09,304 --> 01:08:11,943
The Banking Clan
has hidden huge factories on Muunilinst...

8
01:08:12,024 --> 01:08:14,663
building huge droid armies
and massive warships.

9
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:17,338
- We must act quickly.
- I agree.

10
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:19,301
But who to send?

11
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:22,501
Master Windu still fights
on Dantooine.

12
01:08:22,584 --> 01:08:25,656
Lead the assault
Master Obi-Wan can.

13
01:08:25,744 --> 01:08:28,212
My army is ready, Chancellor.
We can leave immediately.

14
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:31,774
Yes, and young Skywalker as well.

15
01:08:31,864 --> 01:08:36,096
I suggest that we give him
special command of your space forces.

16
01:08:36,184 --> 01:08:39,938
His exceptional skill
will be quite useful.

17
01:08:40,024 --> 01:08:42,379
Chancellor, I feel
that Padawan Anakin...

18
01:08:42,464 --> 01:08:44,580
is not yet ready
for such responsibility.

19
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:48,100
True. With his master
a Padawan's place is.

20
01:08:48,184 --> 01:08:51,301
But undeniably strong
he has become. Perhaps--

21
01:08:51,384 --> 01:08:53,181
Then it is decided.

22
01:09:12,744 --> 01:09:16,180
I doubt even Master Qui-Gon
could have prepared a Jedi for this.

23
01:10:11,904 --> 01:10:14,293
ARC troopers,
you have been selected for this task...

24
01:10:14,384 --> 01:10:16,693
because you are the best, the elite.

25
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:18,342
You all know what to do.

26
01:10:18,424 --> 01:10:21,700
The success of your mission
is our key to a swift victory.

27
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,252
When you get into position,
send word, as planned...

28
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,574
then I will join you.

29
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:43,620
Master, I know you don't think I'm ready
for a command of my own...

30
01:10:43,704 --> 01:10:45,854
but I am the best pilot
in the order.

31
01:10:45,944 --> 01:10:48,583
Chancellor Palpatine knows it.
I don't know why you can't--

32
01:10:48,664 --> 01:10:53,101
Padawan, your skills have never been
in question. It is your maturity.

33
01:10:53,184 --> 01:10:56,062
I've argued this before.
But the decision has been made.

34
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:59,136
May the Force be with you,
Commander.

35
01:11:24,904 --> 01:11:27,134
All squadrons to me.

36
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:54,896
- ARC troopers, deploy!
- Yes, sir.

37
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:11,138
Evasive action!

38
01:12:47,384 --> 01:12:49,056
Roger, roger.

39
01:15:21,744 --> 01:15:23,336
General Kenobi, target sighted.

40
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:25,654
Very good, Sergeant.
Proceed with the next phase.

41
01:16:20,144 --> 01:16:22,612
Troubled is the planet Mon Calamari.

42
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:24,820
Its races have divided.

43
01:16:25,904 --> 01:16:28,702
The droid army of
the Quarren Isolation League...

44
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:31,582
moves against
the Calamari Council.

45
01:16:31,664 --> 01:16:34,781
Alone, the Calamari
are no match.

46
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:37,535
Intervene we must.

47
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:50,334
Master Fisto, in these matters,
trust your insight we do.

48
01:16:50,424 --> 01:16:52,984
May the Force be with you.

49
01:20:09,824 --> 01:20:13,419
Those guns are destroying
our forward positions.

50
01:20:13,504 --> 01:20:15,972
The Republic is breaking through.

51
01:20:21,584 --> 01:20:26,100
Sir, our cannon at the base of the tower
has been destroyed.

52
01:20:26,184 --> 01:20:29,062
Their range is greater
than we thought.

53
01:20:29,904 --> 01:20:31,940
It must be their artillery.

54
01:20:32,024 --> 01:20:34,936
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?

55
01:20:35,024 --> 01:20:39,575
I don't know why Dooku sent you here
if all you're going to do is stand arou--

56
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:43,296
I mean, whenever you're ready.

57
01:22:52,304 --> 01:22:55,421
Everything has been arranged
precisely as you have requested...

58
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,541
most illustrious Count Dooku.

59
01:22:59,304 --> 01:23:00,293
Indeed.

60
01:23:16,064 --> 01:23:19,215
I trust you will find
what you seek.

61
01:23:42,424 --> 01:23:46,019
Impressive.
You mask your presence well.

62
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:48,777
Flawless timing.
Perfect control.

63
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,617
You have great skill of infiltration.

64
01:23:51,704 --> 01:23:55,822
My host would applaud
your abilities posthumously.

65
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:59,499
However, I am not looking
for a spy.

66
01:25:28,024 --> 01:25:30,902
You are more powerful
than I had sensed.

67
01:25:30,984 --> 01:25:33,782
The dark side is strong in me.

68
01:25:33,864 --> 01:25:36,139
For I am Sith.

69
01:25:39,464 --> 01:25:41,056
A bold claim.

70
01:25:41,144 --> 01:25:42,975
But you are not Sith.

71
01:25:52,184 --> 01:25:56,143
You wear the trappings of the Sith,
you fight like the Sith...

72
01:25:56,224 --> 01:25:59,102
but this can be
imitated, however.

73
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:03,018
You lack a vital quality
found in all Sith.

74
01:26:03,104 --> 01:26:07,734
Sith have no fear.
And I sense much fear in you.

75
01:26:07,824 --> 01:26:12,898
You are a foolish old man
who knows nothing of the dark side.

76
01:26:12,984 --> 01:26:14,576
Indeed.

77
01:27:01,064 --> 01:27:03,578
Truly if you were Sith...

78
01:27:03,664 --> 01:27:06,497
would this contest be not over?

79
01:27:29,104 --> 01:27:32,380
It would not be so easy
to defeat a Sith.

80
01:27:32,464 --> 01:27:34,136
So finish it.

81
01:27:34,224 --> 01:27:36,613
We have other plans.

82
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,695
Have you been watching, Master?

83
01:27:38,784 --> 01:27:41,503
I have indeed, Lord Tyranus.

84
01:27:41,584 --> 01:27:45,657
The child's skill with a lightsabre
are most impressive.

85
01:27:45,744 --> 01:27:50,022
You have found a promising disciple,
my apprentice.

86
01:27:50,104 --> 01:27:53,858
- She shall serve us well.
- I am honoured.

87
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:56,299
Let me introduce my master...

88
01:27:56,384 --> 01:27:58,693
the true lord of the Sith...

89
01:27:59,344 --> 01:28:00,902
Darth Sidious.

90
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:02,542
What is your bidding?

91
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:05,980
AJedi named Anakin Skywalker.

92
01:28:06,064 --> 01:28:10,501
You will find him for us
and eliminate him.

93
01:28:10,584 --> 01:28:14,782
Jedi. Their order
is a fading light in the dark.

94
01:28:14,864 --> 01:28:18,539
Corrupt and arrogant.
They must be punished.

95
01:28:18,624 --> 01:28:20,535
The Jedi shall fall!

96
01:28:20,624 --> 01:28:23,616
Consider this a gift.

97
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:33,901
She will be more than a match
for young Skywalker.

98
01:28:33,984 --> 01:28:35,861
It matters not.

99
01:28:35,944 --> 01:28:38,139
She is merely an instrument...

100
01:28:38,224 --> 01:28:41,739
to bring forth
the eradication of theJedi.

101
01:28:47,544 --> 01:28:50,138
General Kenobi,
our cannons are being destroyed.

102
01:28:58,424 --> 01:29:00,176
- Mount up.
- Yes, sir.

103
01:31:20,104 --> 01:31:21,981
General Kenobi,
we are in position.

104
01:31:23,344 --> 01:31:25,539
I'm on my way.

105
01:31:59,744 --> 01:32:02,463
- We're set, General.
- Very well.

106
01:32:02,544 --> 01:32:04,262
Let's end this battle, Commander.

107
01:32:35,624 --> 01:32:36,852
General.

108
01:32:36,944 --> 01:32:40,254
Mercy, I beg you.
I am merely a banker.

109
01:32:40,344 --> 01:32:44,337
That is entirely up to you
and your unconditional surrender.

110
01:33:01,464 --> 01:33:03,136
Control room secure, General.

111
01:33:04,344 --> 01:33:07,097
One can never be
too sure, Commander.

112
01:34:12,264 --> 01:34:14,983
- General, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

113
01:34:15,064 --> 01:34:17,020
Seems I've created
quite the mess now.

114
01:34:17,104 --> 01:34:18,776
- Haven't I?
- Yes, sir.

115
01:34:22,624 --> 01:34:25,218
Now, where were we? Yes.

116
01:34:25,304 --> 01:34:27,135
I believe you were surrendering.

117
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:32,139
We lost Gold Leader.

118
01:35:37,264 --> 01:35:40,222
Commander, enemy reinforcements
coming in .35.

119
01:35:40,304 --> 01:35:42,454
Clear out, Gold 2.
I'm coming in.

120
01:35:42,544 --> 01:35:44,455
R4, switch all power
to forward shields.

121
01:36:20,064 --> 01:36:21,019
I know. I know.

122
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:27,417
Red Leader, fire all your missiles
across the bow of Cruiser 8.

123
01:36:27,504 --> 01:36:29,256
But, Commander,
there's nothing out there.

124
01:36:29,344 --> 01:36:31,938
- No targets.
- Do it now, trooper!

125
01:37:15,784 --> 01:37:17,217
Commander Skywalker...

126
01:37:17,304 --> 01:37:19,534
almost all the gun platforms
are destroyed and only--

127
01:37:19,624 --> 01:37:20,898
Wait. What's that?

128
01:37:22,584 --> 01:37:24,415
Commander, wejust lost
Blue Squadron.

129
01:37:24,504 --> 01:37:26,972
- A rogue fighter has--
- I see it.

130
01:37:27,064 --> 01:37:29,942
Mop up the fighters as planned.
This one's mine.

131
01:38:04,264 --> 01:38:05,697
Got you.

132
01:38:21,424 --> 01:38:22,539
I have you now.

133
01:38:29,504 --> 01:38:31,699
Increase power to the thrusters, R4.

134
01:38:31,784 --> 01:38:33,502
This is no droid pilot.

135
01:38:49,864 --> 01:38:51,217
Come on.

136
01:39:17,984 --> 01:39:20,452
- What was that?
- I don't know, General.

137
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:23,541
- That's not one of ours.
- No, General.

138
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:26,022
- That was Anakin.
- Yes, General.

139
01:39:26,104 --> 01:39:28,140
- Anakin!
- It's under control, Master.

140
01:39:31,904 --> 01:39:34,372
You're supposed to be in space,
leading our forces.

141
01:39:37,464 --> 01:39:38,977
It's under control.

142
01:39:39,064 --> 01:39:41,453
Under control?
I don't think so.

143
01:39:41,544 --> 01:39:44,342
Your place is with your squadrons,
young one...

144
01:39:45,944 --> 01:39:48,583
not chasing one ship
through the city streets.

145
01:39:50,584 --> 01:39:52,814
Master, this is no droid pilot.

146
01:39:52,904 --> 01:39:55,657
And the Force is with him.
I can't let him get away.

147
01:40:01,184 --> 01:40:03,982
Anakin, I'm also sensing
something strange.

148
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:06,942
But you must let that ship go.
It's baiting you.

149
01:40:08,624 --> 01:40:11,661
Jumping into hyperspace?
You have his coordinates?

150
01:40:11,744 --> 01:40:13,974
Then plug them in.
He's not losing us.

151
01:40:14,904 --> 01:40:17,213
Master, the battle up here
is more than won.

152
01:40:17,304 --> 01:40:20,296
- I can handle this.
- Do not follow that ship.

153
01:40:20,384 --> 01:40:23,342
Do you hear me?
Do not follow that ship!

154
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,779
That is an order! Anakin!

155
01:40:25,864 --> 01:40:28,253
Sorry, sir.
Your signal is breaking up.

156
01:40:28,344 --> 01:40:29,743
Padawan, if you--

157
01:40:39,384 --> 01:40:40,737
You have the coordinates?

158
01:40:40,824 --> 01:40:42,655
- Yes, General.
- Take a squad and follow him.

159
01:40:51,184 --> 01:40:53,982
I've got a bad feeling about this.

160
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,984
- Fire at will.
- Roger, roger.

161
01:44:48,144 --> 01:44:49,975
- Recharge accelerators.
- Roger, roger.

162
01:45:27,024 --> 01:45:28,537
- Fire.
- Roger, roger.

163
01:46:09,504 --> 01:46:12,462
Internal explosions all over.
We are losing control.

164
01:46:12,544 --> 01:46:13,659
What?

165
01:47:20,824 --> 01:47:23,975
The crystal is
the heart of the blade.

166
01:47:24,984 --> 01:47:28,420
The heart is
the crystal of the Jedi.

167
01:47:28,504 --> 01:47:32,019
The Jedi is the crystal
of the Force.

168
01:47:32,104 --> 01:47:35,176
The Force is the blade
of the heart.

169
01:47:35,264 --> 01:47:37,494
All are intertwined.

170
01:47:38,224 --> 01:47:40,579
The crystal, the blade...

171
01:47:41,904 --> 01:47:43,542
the Jedi.

172
01:47:43,624 --> 01:47:45,501
You are one.

173
01:47:46,984 --> 01:47:50,659
You have taught me well,
Master Luminara.

174
01:47:50,744 --> 01:47:56,376
Remember always,
the crystal is the heart of the blade.

175
01:47:56,464 --> 01:48:00,298
Barriss Offee,
your training is complete.

176
01:48:04,024 --> 01:48:06,333
Something trespasses
on sacred ground.

177
01:48:06,424 --> 01:48:07,857
The temple is breached.

178
01:48:24,024 --> 01:48:27,141
- I sense a presence, yet see nothing.
- They are here.

179
01:50:08,464 --> 01:50:10,341
To Ilum we must go.

180
01:50:10,424 --> 01:50:11,652
Absolutely not.

181
01:50:11,744 --> 01:50:15,180
You cannot risk the senator's life
like this. Milady, I must protest.

182
01:50:15,264 --> 01:50:17,824
Very little time
there is, Senator.

183
01:50:17,904 --> 01:50:19,496
Our only hope to rescue Jedi.

184
01:50:19,584 --> 01:50:22,144
To Ilum we must go now.

185
01:50:22,224 --> 01:50:23,657
This is not a rescue ship.

186
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,736
May I remind our master Jedi
we have a more pressing mission?

187
01:50:26,824 --> 01:50:30,339
A slight detour.
Jeopardize the mission it will not.

188
01:50:31,384 --> 01:50:33,614
A slight detour.
Jeopardize the mission it will not.

189
01:50:36,024 --> 01:50:38,777
Be put in danger
the senator will not.

190
01:50:38,864 --> 01:50:40,582
Be put in danger
the senator will not.

191
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:45,063
Save the lives of Jedi we must.

192
01:50:45,144 --> 01:50:47,294
Save the lives of Jedi we must.

193
01:50:47,384 --> 01:50:50,023
Master Yoda, I am convinced.

194
01:50:50,104 --> 01:50:54,097
I will not require
my captain's further... persuasion.

195
01:50:57,984 --> 01:51:00,544
Captain. Make best
possible speed to Ilum.

196
01:51:00,624 --> 01:51:02,182
Yes, milady.

197
01:51:02,264 --> 01:51:05,893
Ilum? That planet is
on the other side of the system.

198
01:51:07,064 --> 01:51:08,463
A slight detour?

199
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:11,980
Well, actually, I don't have
a more important place to be.

200
01:51:29,464 --> 01:51:31,261
Stay on the ship you must.

201
01:51:34,384 --> 01:51:36,056
Much danger I sense.

202
01:51:36,144 --> 01:51:40,217
Master Yoda, I can't let you go off
to attempt a rescue mission alone.

203
01:51:40,304 --> 01:51:44,092
Yet alone I must be
for the rescue to succeed.

204
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:51,178
Call you I will
if assistance I require.

205
01:53:34,184 --> 01:53:36,061
I have a bad feeling about this.

206
01:53:36,144 --> 01:53:38,658
Master Yoda has been gone
far too long.

207
01:53:38,744 --> 01:53:40,541
I should have never
let him go alone.

208
01:53:40,624 --> 01:53:42,023
He's a Jedi master, milady.

209
01:53:42,104 --> 01:53:44,572
He's quite capable of handling
whatever may be out there.

210
01:53:44,664 --> 01:53:48,339
Master Yoda did assure you
he would contact you if he required help.

211
01:53:50,184 --> 01:53:52,778
Travelling alone in a blizzard
on an uncharted planet...

212
01:53:52,864 --> 01:53:54,422
is commonplace for a Jedi...

213
01:53:54,504 --> 01:53:56,859
but not a senator.

214
01:53:56,944 --> 01:53:59,504
Miss Padme is safer where she is.

215
01:54:00,144 --> 01:54:01,702
3PO is right, R2.

216
01:54:03,704 --> 01:54:06,059
I'll run a diagnostic
on the communication array.

217
01:54:06,144 --> 01:54:08,817
This weather has been giving us
some low-band interference.

218
01:54:10,664 --> 01:54:13,132
R2, does this weather
affect your sensors?

219
01:54:14,744 --> 01:54:18,134
Not in the slightest.
Or so he says.

220
01:54:19,384 --> 01:54:22,182
Good. I'm going to
look for Master Yoda.

221
01:54:22,264 --> 01:54:25,142
- Alone?
- No. You two will accompany me.

222
01:54:26,544 --> 01:54:27,977
Oh, dear.

223
01:54:35,224 --> 01:54:36,418
What is it, R2?

224
01:54:37,624 --> 01:54:40,775
It seems there are multiple objects
approaching from that direction.

225
01:54:40,864 --> 01:54:41,774
Where?

226
01:54:43,744 --> 01:54:47,498
Ambush! I knew
this was a bad idea!

227
01:55:07,424 --> 01:55:08,300
Gotcha.

228
01:55:10,224 --> 01:55:13,182
R2 says there are
two more still out there.

229
01:55:13,264 --> 01:55:14,458
Two more?

230
01:55:17,784 --> 01:55:19,979
3PO, could you get my coat?

231
01:55:20,064 --> 01:55:21,577
Of course, Miss Padme.

232
01:55:25,424 --> 01:55:27,335
I must be out of my circuit.

233
01:55:35,304 --> 01:55:38,899
Help! Help!
I've been buried alive!

234
01:55:40,864 --> 01:55:42,297
Thanks, 3PO.

235
01:55:44,504 --> 01:55:47,177
It was a pleasure, Miss Padme.

236
01:55:48,424 --> 01:55:50,460
What is it, R2? More droids?

237
01:55:50,544 --> 01:55:52,774
More? Oh, no!

238
01:55:56,704 --> 01:55:58,296
Master Yoda!

239
01:56:00,704 --> 01:56:02,535
I'm so glad you're all right.

240
01:56:02,624 --> 01:56:06,014
Successful my mission was.
Safe the Jedi are.

241
01:56:07,984 --> 01:56:09,656
But pain my heart is.

242
01:56:09,744 --> 01:56:11,575
What troubles you, Master Yoda?

243
01:56:11,664 --> 01:56:13,780
Nearly destroyed the temple was.

244
01:56:13,864 --> 01:56:15,775
Revealed its secret location is.

245
01:56:15,864 --> 01:56:17,980
But by who I know not.

246
01:56:23,104 --> 01:56:27,177
You will find the temple on Ilum.
Destroy it.

247
01:56:46,264 --> 01:56:47,697
Do you have his position?

248
01:56:48,704 --> 01:56:52,458
That's close enough, R4. We'll just have
to search the immediate area on foot.

249
01:56:55,504 --> 01:56:57,938
Watch the ship, R4.
This won't take long.

250
01:57:18,864 --> 01:57:20,616
Hut, hut!

251
01:57:23,184 --> 01:57:24,663
Secure the area.

252
01:57:25,984 --> 01:57:27,497
- Sergeant.
- Commander Skywalker.

253
01:57:27,584 --> 01:57:29,063
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, sir.

254
01:57:29,144 --> 01:57:31,100
- Gave you orders to follow me.
- Yes, sir.

255
01:57:32,304 --> 01:57:34,454
Fine. Have some men
protect the ships.

256
01:57:34,544 --> 01:57:37,183
The rest encircle the clearing.
Prepare to sweep the jungle.

257
01:58:37,144 --> 01:58:39,453
Something's not right.
I can feel it.

258
01:58:47,464 --> 01:58:48,863
Trooper?

259
01:58:51,384 --> 01:58:52,373
Trooper?

260
01:58:54,864 --> 01:58:57,776
Trooper, are you all right?
What happened?

261
01:59:24,584 --> 01:59:27,701
I'm going to make you pay
for what you've done.

262
01:59:27,784 --> 01:59:29,854
Come, Padawan.

263
01:59:29,944 --> 01:59:34,415
Your fall will be
my ascension to the Sith.

264
02:05:38,184 --> 02:05:39,378
Blast him.

265
02:06:06,304 --> 02:06:09,774
The IG Banking Clan
has surrendered. The day is ours.

266
02:06:09,864 --> 02:06:11,820
The Republic is victorious.

267
02:06:25,144 --> 02:06:26,862
General Kenobi,
a ship is approaching...

268
02:06:26,944 --> 02:06:29,822
that matches the one Commander
Skywalker followed into hyperspace.

269
02:06:29,904 --> 02:06:32,134
I have batteries standing by.

270
02:06:32,224 --> 02:06:33,816
Hold your fire, Captain.

271
02:06:47,304 --> 02:06:48,737
Commander Skywalker!

272
02:06:54,904 --> 02:06:57,543
I'm sorry, Master.
You were right.

273
02:06:57,624 --> 02:07:00,092
It was a trap--
laid out by the Sith.

274
02:07:00,784 --> 02:07:04,333
And I ran headlong into it.
But I emerged victorious.

275
02:07:04,424 --> 02:07:08,417
Indeed. But that battle
should never have been fought.

276
02:07:08,504 --> 02:07:11,860
I find the Sith's interest
in you most troublesome.

277
02:07:11,944 --> 02:07:14,697
This is precisely why
you must follow my orders, young one.

278
02:07:14,784 --> 02:07:16,854
Another defiance
could lead us into a dan--

279
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,460
General Kenobi!
General Kenobi!

280
02:07:19,544 --> 02:07:20,579
Yes, Master Barrek.

281
02:07:20,664 --> 02:07:23,053
Need immediate evac
from planet Hypori!

282
02:07:23,144 --> 02:07:25,021
Our forces are totally destroyed.

283
02:07:25,104 --> 02:07:27,413
Only a few of us left.

284
02:07:28,064 --> 02:07:31,136
New droid general.
He's unstoppable.

285
02:07:31,224 --> 02:07:34,580
Can't hold out for long.
General Grievous is hunting us.

286
02:07:35,224 --> 02:07:37,692
- Must hurry!
- Master Barrek, come in.

287
02:07:40,984 --> 02:07:43,737
Come in. Master Barrek!
Come in!

288
02:08:22,424 --> 02:08:24,142
Why have they stopped?

289
02:08:25,624 --> 02:08:27,216
- Master?
- Go. Go.

290
02:08:35,944 --> 02:08:37,741
Unstoppable.

291
02:08:37,824 --> 02:08:40,179
He is unstoppable.

292
02:08:40,264 --> 02:08:43,301
Never have we been
outmanoeuvred by droids.

293
02:08:43,384 --> 02:08:45,102
His strategy is without flaw.

294
02:08:45,184 --> 02:08:47,618
This is the end.
We're all doomed.

295
02:08:47,704 --> 02:08:51,822
Our predicament is dire,
but do not despair.

296
02:08:51,904 --> 02:08:53,974
Focus. We are Jedi.

297
02:08:56,264 --> 02:08:57,413
Jedi.

298
02:09:06,704 --> 02:09:10,219
You are surrounded.
Your army is decimated.

299
02:09:10,304 --> 02:09:13,137
Make peace with the Force now...

300
02:09:13,224 --> 02:09:15,454
for this is your final hour.

301
02:09:15,544 --> 02:09:21,096
But know that I, General Grievous,
am not completely without mercy.

302
02:09:21,184 --> 02:09:25,018
I will grant you
a warrior's death. Prepare.

303
02:09:36,704 --> 02:09:38,376
I can't see anything.

304
02:09:42,024 --> 02:09:43,423
That noise.

305
02:09:45,104 --> 02:09:47,015
He is coming alone.

306
02:09:48,304 --> 02:09:50,864
- We can't face him.
- We must try, Padawan.

307
02:09:58,424 --> 02:10:01,496
- It's close, but where?
- It's all around us.

308
02:10:01,584 --> 02:10:03,415
Calm yourself.

309
02:10:07,064 --> 02:10:08,053
Steady.

310
02:10:16,224 --> 02:10:17,782
Steady.

311
02:10:31,744 --> 02:10:32,859
Get back.

312
02:11:57,904 --> 02:11:59,098
Ki-Adi.

313
02:12:01,104 --> 02:12:02,583
Hurry.

314
02:12:07,864 --> 02:12:09,263
Shaak Ti.

315
02:12:36,984 --> 02:12:40,659
Darker the coming storm
grows, I fear.

316
02:12:40,744 --> 02:12:44,134
The dark cloud of the Sith
shrouds us all.

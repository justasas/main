Your failure is most unfortunate.

329
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,798
I will have to discuss this with my master.

330

You have my Padawan to thank for that.

334
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,322
She always said
you guys would pull through.

335

General Plo said
someone would come for us.

336
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,576
We're glad he was right.

337
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,580
Skywalker, it is time
to give our report to the Council.

Right, the Council report.

You want me there?
I figured because of before...

00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:08,386
Ahsoka, through it all you never gave up.
You did a great job.

But if I'm getting in trouble for this,

344

you're gonna share
some of the blame, too.

-So, come on. Let's go.
-Right beside you, master.

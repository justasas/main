1
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:20,712
<i>Jedi form rebel alliance!</i>

2
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:22,844
<i>Led by Anakin Skywalker,</i>

3
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,215
<i>the Jedi have trained a band of rebels</i>

4
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,585
<i>to fight the Separatists
on the planet Onderon.</i>

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,754
<i>With the help of the Jedi,
the rebels escape capture</i>

6
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:35,224
<i>and infiltrated the heavily
fortified city of Iziz.</i>

7
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,959
<i>Now our heroes
have launched an armed campaign</i>

8
00:00:37,993 --> 00:00:41,129
<i>to subvert the Separatist
occupation of the planet.</i>

9
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:44,131
<i>The Jedi Council
continue to observe and advise</i>

10
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,232
<i>as the rebels strive to gain momentum</i>

11
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:48,401
<i>against the Separatist forces.</i>

12
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:51,036
<i>Despite the absence
of civilian casualties,</i>

13
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:52,705
<i>public fear has ensued</i>

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,972
<i>as reports
of the rebels' daring strikes</i>

15
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,308
<i>circulate throughout the city.</i>

16
00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:11,519
Your identification failed.

17
00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:12,720
That's not possible.

18
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:16,156
You are coming with us.

19
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:18,191
Hey!

20
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:21,860
- What's going on?
- No!

21
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:01,055
The rebels are attacking again.

22
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:04,358
That is the fifth time this rotation.

23
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:11,330
That should give King Rash
something to think about.

24
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,232
Huh, I'm sure
you've gotten his attention.

25
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:36,382
Dendup has been summoned
and awaits your order, my lord.

26
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,984
What about the terrorists?

27
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:41,286
They've attacked
a checkpoint near the canal

28
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,555
and two droid patrols,

29
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:45,589
one in Malgan Market.

30
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,558
If they think destroying a few droids

31
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:52,195
is going to effect change,
they've run a fool's errand.

32
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,096
One more thing, my lord.

33
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,365
The royal carriage was ambushed

34
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,634
soon after it left the residence.

35
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:03,604
Hmm, an attempt on my life.

36
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:05,537
It appears that way.

37
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,341
Get my predecessor in here.

38
00:03:21,184 --> 00:03:23,617
You surprise me.

39
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:27,986
Engaging with extremists
is beneath you.

40
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:31,323
Do you really want
your crown back that badly?

41
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:36,561
I only want freedom for my people.

42
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:38,829
Hmm.

43
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:41,497
Your supporters are responsible
for terrorist acts

44
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:43,999
against the kingdom and our allies.

45
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,934
I didn't know that.

46
00:03:45,969 --> 00:03:49,971
You've made it quite impossible
to stay informed of anything

47
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:52,406
outside my prison chamber.

48
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:56,476
Call off the attacks.

49
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:59,612
I cannot call off
what I did not dictate.

50
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:01,480
What you are up against

51
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:03,983
is simply the will of the people.

52
00:04:04,017 --> 00:04:08,852
It's up to the king
to embrace, bend, or break it.

53
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:11,688
And I am no longer the king.

54
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:14,289
Stop the attacks,

55
00:04:14,324 --> 00:04:17,191
or you will atone with your life.

56
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:20,762
It is you that must end the attacks

57
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:23,930
by ending the droid occupation.

58
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:13,868
Your success will not go unnoticed.

59
00:05:15,972 --> 00:05:19,873
I agree, but we need to be
mindful of public perception.

60
00:05:19,907 --> 00:05:21,941
What was your observation, Padawan?

61
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:24,543
The people were fearful, Master.

62
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:25,910
Indeed.

63
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,012
Judging from the reactions
I saw today,

64
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:31,315
I'm afraid they will mistake
your intentions.

65
00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:32,817
We need to do more damage.

66
00:05:32,851 --> 00:05:36,153
A few dozen broken-down droids
will do little to free Onderon.

67
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,755
The people need to believe
we can succeed.

68
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,191
Without their support,
our efforts are meaningless.

69
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:43,360
If they're afraid,
they won't support us.

70
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:45,762
We need to assure them
of our intentions.

71
00:05:45,796 --> 00:05:48,130
I don't understand.
Why are they afraid?

72
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,798
They're afraid
we're not strong enough to win.

73
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,833
We need to earn their trust.

74
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:55,636
You'll have plenty of time
to earn their trust.

75
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,471
All of you are going to be very busy.

76
00:05:57,505 --> 00:05:59,805
Today was only a taste.

77
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,673
You'll get your chance.

78
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:06,378
In the meantime,
make the most of your victories.

79
00:06:06,412 --> 00:06:08,846
Welcome and learn from them.

80
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,349
Perhaps if we hit something big,

81
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:13,316
gave a show of strength,

82
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,617
they will overcome their fear
and join us.

83
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:17,619
Do you have something in mind?

84
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:20,552
I know the perfect target.

85
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,894
I think they're ready to give
the 501 some competition.

86
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,295
Let's not get carried away, General,

87
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,731
though these rebels have impressed me.

88
00:06:31,765 --> 00:06:34,465
We will share the developments
with the Jedi Council.

89
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,400
Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor.

90
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:41,003
Monitor them and report back
with their progress.

91
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,704
Are you up for it, Snips?

92
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,339
Or would you like
to return to Coruscant?

93
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,508
No, Master.

94
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:48,842
I want to stay.

95
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:50,176
Good.

96
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,245
We should continue
to provide supplies and credits,

97
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,280
but they must learn
to operate on their own.

98
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,449
Their survival depends on it.

99
00:06:57,484 --> 00:06:59,317
Yes, Master.

100
00:06:59,351 --> 00:07:01,352
Remember your purpose.

101
00:07:24,393 --> 00:07:28,295
This power generator feeds
substations across the city.

102
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,665
We hit that, the entire grid falls.

103
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,266
How does that help us?

104
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,001
Battle droids are no longer
linked to central control.

105
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,870
They operate individually.

106
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,705
Yes, but they still need power
to recharge.

107
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,340
If we take out this facility,

108
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,175
it will knock out the power grid,

109
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,811
and then it will only be
a matter of time

110
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:48,346
until the droid army
is brought to a standstill,

111
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,513
literally.

112
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:51,314
If you carry the plan out
by nightfall,

113
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:54,049
you'll maximize
your strike capability.

114
00:07:54,084 --> 00:07:55,618
Okay, so we just need to figure out

115
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,952
how to destroy the power station.

116
00:07:57,986 --> 00:08:01,089
We need to do more surveillance.

117
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:03,290
Those droids should have
all the intel we need

118
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,591
stored up in those tin cans
of theirs, right?

119
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:06,892
They should.

120
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,494
Then I'll get us one.

121
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,944
Hey, clanker.

122
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:39,050
Uh-oh.

123
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,126
Sentries at every access point,

124
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,894
inside and out.

125
00:08:52,928 --> 00:08:55,997
We can't sustain combat
against their numbers.

126
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,933
But our size makes us perfect
for mobility and surprise.

127
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:02,268
We need something with heavy firepower

128
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,637
if we are to blow up this facility.

129
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:06,471
If we give them enough trouble,

130
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:08,773
they'll call for reinforcements.

131
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,107
Like a tank.

132
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:11,341
Exactly.

133
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,410
Then you can provide cover
while we hijack it.

134
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:17,646
And then we use
their own weapon against them.

135
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,250
And we bring the droid army
to its knees.

136
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:32,692
Shh.

137
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:49,938
Remember the plan.

138
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:51,173
We attack this patrol,

139
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,009
and hopefully they will
call in a tank for backup.

140
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:18,496
Ah!

141
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,563
Let's go.

142
00:10:31,406 --> 00:10:33,706
Patrol 118 to central.

143
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,109
We've been ambushed by terrorists

144
00:10:37,143 --> 00:10:39,009
and need reinforcements.

145
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,211
Let's hope they send a tank.

146
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:46,216
Hear that?

147
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,483
They've sent destroyers.

148
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,551
Move!

149
00:11:05,462 --> 00:11:07,929
We're not gonna last unless
we take out those destroyers.

150
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:09,431
We have to get behind them.

151
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,465
Let's go.

152
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,649
Roll it slow so it gets through.

153
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:35,750
I know that.

154
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:38,819
Nice job.

155
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,186
You screwed me up.

156
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,268
Thanks.

157
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,706
I've never seen a destroyer
taken out that way before.

158
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,274
We all have to adapt.

159
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,280
There's our tank.

160
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,751
Split up.

161
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,610
Let's move.

162
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,369
Good work.

163
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,504
Now, let's get this thing
up and running again.

164
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:42,683
What are you waiting for?

165
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,050
Give me a second.

166
00:13:44,085 --> 00:13:45,418
Do you know what you're doing?

167
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:48,921
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

168
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:50,556
You boys having a problem?

169
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,623
No. No problem. Why?

170
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:54,725
Well, come on.
We need to get moving.

171
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,560
Hey, who put you in charge?

172
00:13:56,595 --> 00:13:57,627
All right.

173
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,362
Get out of the tank, hotshot.

174
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:01,429
This needs a woman's touch.

175
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:03,564
Fine. Be my guest.

176
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,365
We need to get to that power generator

177
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,700
before they realize
this tank's gone missing.

178
00:14:07,734 --> 00:14:09,801
We're running out of time.

179
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:12,937
I was gonna do that.

180
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:15,172
Uh-huh. Sure.

181
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,611
Couldn't have done it better myself.

182
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,412
Now, that's the truth.

183
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,743
I'll draw their fire.

184
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:48,778
Good luck.

185
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:49,846
Good luck.

186
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll cover you.

187
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,067
We're almost in position.

188
00:15:15,101 --> 00:15:16,602
Ready when you are, Steela.

189
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:23,173
A sniper. Get her.

190
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,008
Roger, roger.

191
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:52,128
Look.
We have reinforcements.

192
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,697
Hey, you're not a droid.

193
00:15:55,732 --> 00:15:57,432
Get down from there.

194
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:18,815
Fire the gun.

195
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:20,416
The gun is recharging.

196
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:31,992
You're all clear.

197
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:57,745
Looks like all that training
is paying off.

198
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:08,553
My lord, without power,
the droids will be massacred.

199
00:17:08,587 --> 00:17:12,455
This loss will work for us.

200
00:17:26,868 --> 00:17:28,568
There's been a power outage.

201
00:17:28,602 --> 00:17:30,437
I've lost contact with command.

202
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,905
Switch to infrared.

203
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,306
Aah!

204
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:38,929
- It's the rebels.
- Fight for Onderon!

205
00:17:38,944 --> 00:17:40,211
They're destroying the droids!

206
00:17:40,246 --> 00:17:42,947
- Free Onderon!
- Freedom!

207
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:44,181
Fight for freedom!

208
00:17:44,215 --> 00:17:45,548
Get the droids!

209
00:17:45,582 --> 00:17:47,216
Freedom!
Freedom!

210
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:02,226
For freedom!
For Onderon!

211
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:09,632
- Yeah!
- Yes!

212
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,399
For freedom!
For Onderon!

213
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,141
Show those droids what we're worth.

214
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:23,809
We must celebrate.

215
00:18:23,843 --> 00:18:25,377
With pleasure.

216
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,483
Come here, you handsome senator.

217
00:18:38,221 --> 00:18:39,822
<i>Steela is a born leader.</i>

218
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:42,290
<i>And quite courageous, I hear.</i>

219
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:46,326
<i>Ahsoka, remember what I told you</i>

220
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,128
<i>about staying focused.</i>

221
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,028
I can't help it, Master.

222
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>I understand.</i>

223
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,630
You do?

224
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:53,630
<i>I do.</i>

225
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,132
<i>But try to remember,</i>

226
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,800
<i>always put purpose
ahead of your feelings.</i>

227
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:59,101
<i>This latest development</i>

228
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:01,502
<i>will surely get
Count Dooku's attention.</i>

229
00:19:01,536 --> 00:19:03,904
<i>He will respond harshly.</i>

230
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:06,072
<i>They will stop at nothing to find you.</i>

231
00:19:06,106 --> 00:19:08,474
<i>You must adapt
and continue to confront them</i>

232
00:19:08,508 --> 00:19:10,275
<i>in order to liberate Onderon.</i>

233
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,309
We will.

234
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,744
And we shall win.

235
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:14,845
<i>In that, I have no doubt.</i>

236
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,147
<i>Now you must rally the people.</i>

237
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,148
<i>You will need their support.</i>

238
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,649
<i>Your ability to influence them</i>

239
00:19:20,684 --> 00:19:24,419
<i>will also determine
your capacity to represent them</i>

240
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,454
<i>not only on the battlefield
but off of it</i>

241
00:19:26,488 --> 00:19:29,924
<i>against your enemies,
even within your own ranks.</i>

242
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,225
<i>Your commitment will inspire others.</i>

243
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,694
<i>Your conviction will lead to victory.</i>

244
00:19:34,729 --> 00:19:36,028
<i>After tonight's efforts,</i>

245
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,764
<i>the people will be ready to follow.</i>

246
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,800
<i>You will need a leader
for them to rally behind.</i>

247
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,440
They are waging a very public war.

248
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:50,609
Every trespass is an embarrassment.

249
00:19:52,044 --> 00:19:56,447
<i>Your forces cannot manage
a small band of terrorists?</i>

250
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:59,783
My lord, your droids
have become ineffective

251
00:19:59,818 --> 00:20:02,119
against the mounting rebel attacks.

252
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:04,954
<i>I thought I could trust you
to rule Onderon.</i>

253
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:08,990
<i>I find this report most disappointing.</i>

254
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,994
It seems that the rebels
are far more organized

255
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:16,762
than they were in the past.

256
00:20:16,797 --> 00:20:19,731
The attack against the power
generators proves that.

257
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,732
Perhaps it's time you send me
better reinforcements

258
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,534
than the droids I have.

259
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,902
<i>I will grant you this request</i>

260
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:29,571
<i>and not only send you better droids</i>

261
00:20:29,606 --> 00:20:31,539
<i>but a better general.</i>

262
00:20:31,574 --> 00:20:33,241
<i>This is Kalani.</i>

263
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:37,711
<i>I assure you he will succeed
where you have failed.</i>

264
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,448
We need to build on our momentum

265
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:46,484
and continue our attacks
to keep them off balance.

266
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,653
We have to assure the people first.

267
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:50,421
If we keep disrupting their lives,

268
00:20:50,455 --> 00:20:52,322
we risk alienating them.

269
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:54,725
We have to gain their trust.

270
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:56,426
I agree with both of you.

271
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,294
We can balance both.

272
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,430
We also need to recruit others
to join us.

273
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:03,333
Onderon is ours.

274
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,067
We will remind everyone

275
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,668
and keep reminding them

276
00:21:06,703 --> 00:21:08,336
until we get it back.

277
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,937
- Onderon is ours!
- Onderon is ours!

278
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,106
- Free Onderon!
- Onderon!

279
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,739
For freedom!

280
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,911
All in favor of Steela as our leader,

281
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,346
raise your hand.

282
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:28,250
Okay.

283
00:21:28,284 --> 00:21:29,650
Looks like it's been decided.

284
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:31,452
You're the leader.

285
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,888
Saw.

286
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:35,989
Let him go.

287
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,457
He just needs to blow off some steam.

288
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:38,457
He'll be back.

289
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:42,059
I can't.

290
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,961
Why?

291
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:45,897
He's my brother.

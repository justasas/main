1
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,540
Going somewhere, Solo?

2
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:08,130
It's too late.

3
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,630
You should have paid him when you had the chance.

4
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,840
Jabba's put a price on your head so large

5
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,640
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

6
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,310
I'm lucky I found you first.

7
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,270
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

8
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,320
Jabba's through with you.

9
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,780
He has no time for smugglers

10
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:38,200
who drop their shipments at the first
sign of an Imperial cruiser.

11
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:44,710
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

12
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,130
That's the idea.

13
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,210
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

14
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,160
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

15
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,340
Have you now.

16
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,430
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

17
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,180
Why haven't you paid me...

18
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,100
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

19
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,610
Han, I can't make exceptions.

20
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,610
What if everyone who smuggled for me

21
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,200
dropped their cargo at the first sign

22
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:23,910
of an Imperial starship?

23
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,330
It's not good business.

24
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:44,390
Han, my boy, you're the best.

25
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,510
So, for an extra twenty percent...

26
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,730
Okay, fifteen percent.

27
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,730
But, if you fail me again...

28
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,900
I'll put a price on your head so big,

29
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,990
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

30
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:06,740
Come on!

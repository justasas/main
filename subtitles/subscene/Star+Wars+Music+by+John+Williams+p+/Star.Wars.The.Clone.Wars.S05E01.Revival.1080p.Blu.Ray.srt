1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,088
<i>Death and destruction!</i>

2
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:23,692
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress spread chaos</i>

3
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:25,997
<i>as they descend on the outer rim.</i>

4
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:28,773
<i>After rescuing his brother from despair,</i>

5
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:32,556
<i>Savage and Maul murder
and pillage at every turn.</i>

6
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,926
<i>Fueled by rage and vengeance,</i>

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,363
<i>they search for meaning
in their new alliance</i>

8
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,570
<i>as reports of their brutal attacks</i>

9
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:42,210
<i>spread across the galaxy.</i>

10
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:08,910
Fan out.

11
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:12,087
I want a scan of the entire perimeter.

12
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:16,463
SD-357, have you found
anyone in the South passage?

13
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,010
357, where are you?

14
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,952
Intruders!

15
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,359
You are trespassing on intergalactic...

16
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,099
Look, brother, a fortune.

17
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:11,070
True fortune will be the demise of Kenobi.

18
00:02:11,105 --> 00:02:14,511
Credit chips are meaningless
without a plan to survive.

19
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:17,587
The Jedi are hunting us.

20
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:19,925
We will be forced to make a stand.

21
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,595
And we will deal with them.

22
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:24,899
They are too many.

23
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:28,841
To continue, we need one singular vision...

24
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,678
my vision.

25
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:33,849
Brother, let us share our strength.

26
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:38,221
There is no need for dominance between us.

27
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:41,227
Always two there are, my brother,

28
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:44,266
a master and an apprentice,

29
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,467
and you are the apprentice.

30
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:56,588
So it is time for a lesson.

31
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:10,104
You have grown so powerful.

32
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:15,345
And I shall complete your training.

33
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:17,849
Not as your brother

34
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,974
but as your master.

35
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:32,332
The distress signal is coming from here,

36
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,566
the Meridian sector,

37
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,101
Cybloc System.

38
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:38,708
It is close enough to the earlier attack.

39
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,245
I have a feeling it's them.

40
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,491
They ought to be flush.

41
00:03:51,525 --> 00:03:52,827
Chips were all unlocked.

42
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,594
No way to trace 'em.

43
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,228
All done by the two crabbiest Zabraks

44
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:58,964
this side of the Hydian.

45
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:00,968
They were alone?

46
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:02,070
Yup, yup.

47
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:03,340
What were they,

48
00:04:03,374 --> 00:04:05,812
a couple of Jedi gone rogue or something?

49
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:10,420
They're not Jedi.

50
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:11,488
Do me a favor.

51
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:14,591
Spark up that lightsaber, would you?

52
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:15,759
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,495
Well, the droids that got attacked

54
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,769
said that theirs were red.

55
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,671
They are Sith, and we need to find them

56
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:24,808
before they strike again.

57
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:28,044
Well, they took my cargo ship.

58
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,846
The droid survivor said
they heard something

59
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,282
about the Sertar sector.

60
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:40,657
What is in the Sertar sector?

61
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,326
That's where Florrum is.

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,527
You've been there?

63
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:45,995
What can we expect?

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,031
Pirates.

65
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,252
Get me a readout on that ship.

66
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:07,587
There are life-forms aboard.

67
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,389
The main reactor and
hyperdrive generator are down.

68
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,091
I think they're stranded.

69
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:15,929
And their communications?

70
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:19,601
Operational but silenced.

71
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:20,903
Mm.

72
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:23,706
We'll kill anyone on
board and take the ship.

73
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:26,678
Let's hope they have a wealth of cargo.

74
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,604
Pure sansanna spices.

75
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,841
Hondo will be pleased.

76
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,110
We drink tonight.

77
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:56,883
Now, find me those life-forms.

78
00:05:59,188 --> 00:06:00,520
Jedi.

79
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,767
Do you want to live?

80
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,935
Yes, very badly.

81
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:21,447
We will make you rich.

82
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,848
Your skills and talents
could serve us well.

83
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,416
The choice is yours.

84
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,688
Are you... are you hiring us?

85
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:33,093
What kind of Jedi are you?

86
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,595
We are not Jedi.

87
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,463
We are lords,

88
00:06:38,497 --> 00:06:40,664
crime lords.

89
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,734
We work for Hondo.

90
00:06:42,768 --> 00:06:44,405
You'll have to pay us really well

91
00:06:44,473 --> 00:06:46,643
to get us to betray him.

92
00:06:46,678 --> 00:06:50,145
Money is of no object for men like us.

93
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:53,712
You will have all that you desire and more

94
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,721
if you pledge yourselves to me.

95
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,456
All right.

96
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:03,961
I'm tired of working for Hondo anyway.

97
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:05,897
I'll call up a couple of boys

98
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:08,867
and see if they'll join us.

99
00:07:16,464 --> 00:07:21,101
I am certain captain Hondo
will never throw in with you.

100
00:07:21,135 --> 00:07:24,105
Hondo's base will soon be ours,

101
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:26,443
and he will not survive this,

102
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:31,280
unless he embraces the
same choice I give you now.

103
00:07:34,785 --> 00:07:36,252
Ha, I'm in.

104
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,586
So am I.

105
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,254
I am not sure.

106
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:41,723
Let's see what Hondo says about that.

107
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,035
<i>Three of your lieutenants</i>

108
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:51,476
<i>have already sworn allegiance to me.</i>

109
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:55,582
Traitors. Scum!

110
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:57,385
I'm so proud...

111
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,062
but so betrayed.

112
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:06,068
There is a penalty for resistance.

113
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,619
<i>Let me warn you,</i>

114
00:08:16,686 --> 00:08:20,586
<i>you are not the first
laser sword-wielding maniac</i>

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,758
<i>I've had to deal with,</i>

116
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:28,701
<i>and Hondo Ohnaka survives every time.</i>

117
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:31,136
We shall see.

118
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:46,055
We have a match on the cargo ship.

119
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:49,160
It seems Maul and Savage have
picked up a pirate escort.

120
00:08:49,194 --> 00:08:52,263
Maybe to unload the stolen cargo.

121
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,836
I'm not sure the pirate
Hondo would have an alliance

122
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,240
with Maul and his brother.

123
00:08:57,274 --> 00:09:00,344
So you know this Hondo personally?

124
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,414
Unfortunately, yes.

125
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:09,057
Oi, Hondo, there's a Jedi contacting you.

126
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,929
Says his name is Kenobi.

127
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:13,264
Kenobi?

128
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:14,566
Ha!

129
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,033
My, aren't we popular today?

130
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,734
Put him through. Go. Go. Go.

131
00:09:20,871 --> 00:09:22,438
<i>Greetings, Hondo.</i>

132
00:09:22,473 --> 00:09:23,809
Greetings?

133
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:27,313
What kind of menace have
you brought to my planet now?

134
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:29,582
First, you lose this system

135
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:31,151
and Grievous comes in

136
00:09:31,185 --> 00:09:33,689
and destroys my entire stronghold,

137
00:09:33,756 --> 00:09:37,594
leaving me here to just
rummage through the leftovers

138
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,999
of my once great empire.

139
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:44,338
And now these two horned men show up.

140
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:47,274
Who are these horny-headed maniacs?

141
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,780
They don't seem like normal Jedi.

142
00:09:49,814 --> 00:09:52,451
<i>Not Jedi, Hondo, Sith.</i>

143
00:09:52,485 --> 00:09:53,953
<i>We tracked them here.</i>

144
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:58,959
They just threatened to attack
with a group of my men...

145
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:00,525
my own men!

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,325
Yes, we are looking at them right now,

147
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,028
a cargo vessel and three of your starships.

148
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,965
They are heading toward you, Hondo.

149
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,637
<i>Dadada, more to the point,</i>

150
00:10:09,672 --> 00:10:12,011
<i>are you going to help me when you get here?</i>

151
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,844
There's nothing we can do about your men,

152
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,812
but we can certainly do
something about the Sith.

153
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:19,483
<i>Good. I'll deal with my men.</i>

154
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:22,623
<i>You deal with those tattooed crazies.</i>

155
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:23,658
Right.

156
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,002
Well, that settles it.

157
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,471
Those traitors are no longer my men.

158
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,817
I want their tongues!

159
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:28,856
The Jedi, brother, they've found us.

160
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,359
No, it's too soon.

161
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:34,425
My plan isn't finished yet.

162
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,626
Too soon.

163
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,938
Throwing in with pirates now?

164
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:51,940
Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen.

165
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:21,329
Ah!

166
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:36,882
No.

167
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,851
I have plans, Kenobi,

168
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,754
and you will not stand in my way this time.

169
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,504
No!

170
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:25,890
Kenobi, this way!

171
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,635
Take this cannon down the hole.

172
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:47,998
We will ambush those traitors there.

173
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:55,758
Where are the rest of your men?

174
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,726
They are setting up an ambush.

175
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,462
We can use your help.

176
00:13:59,497 --> 00:14:01,131
Where is the other Jedi?

177
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:03,736
She's... she's dead.

178
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,805
She's d...

179
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,944
They are too powerful for even you?

180
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:11,246
I am semi-speechless.

181
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:11,558
I think they went this way.

182
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:14,352
- I think they went this way.
- Let's go down this hall here.

183
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,855
I shall draw the brothers away.

184
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,861
Once that's done, blast
the passageway closed.

185
00:14:18,896 --> 00:14:22,698
And leave you alone with the two crazies?

186
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:23,932
Well, okay.

187
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,211
Retreat! Retreat!

188
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,481
Do not let them escape!

189
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:48,305
Now!

190
00:14:55,014 --> 00:14:56,818
Surrender.

191
00:14:56,853 --> 00:15:01,790
We are two, and you are
no match for us both.

192
00:15:01,824 --> 00:15:03,826
You are mistaken.

193
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,370
Are you still willing to fight me?

194
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:17,007
The horned men aren't
interested in helping you.

195
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,113
They are only interested in Kenobi.

196
00:15:45,635 --> 00:15:48,203
They promised us wealth and power, boss.

197
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,871
Please forgive us.

198
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:52,407
Please don't kill us.

199
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:53,874
We beg of you.

200
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:55,108
Kill you?

201
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:58,480
Oh, I would not kill you.

202
00:15:58,516 --> 00:16:03,989
Everyone, the horned men's ship
is filled with valuable goods.

203
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:06,493
As your restored leader,

204
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:09,632
I say we celebrate our reunification.

205
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:10,933
To the landing pad!

206
00:16:12,001 --> 00:16:13,134
Right, Hondo, right!

207
00:16:30,382 --> 00:16:31,382
Savage!

208
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,020
Come, my apprentice.

209
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,828
This plan has failed,

210
00:16:44,863 --> 00:16:47,699
but we will have another opportunity.

211
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,249
Jiro, ready the men! We're leaving.

212
00:17:02,283 --> 00:17:06,089
My men aren't going anywhere with you.

213
00:17:06,123 --> 00:17:07,493
Look at them.

214
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,262
How powerful can they be?

215
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:12,465
They are running away from Kenobi.

216
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:16,202
Filth, you'll pay for your insolence.

217
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:18,606
Insolence?

218
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:20,277
We are pirates!

219
00:17:20,311 --> 00:17:22,383
We don't even know what that means.

220
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,354
Open fire!

221
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:27,157
If we kill those two,

222
00:17:27,191 --> 00:17:29,894
their riches will be ours!

223
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:30,065
Our engines have been compromised.

224
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,835
Get to the escape pod.

225
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:34,439
It's too late.

226
00:18:34,473 --> 00:18:36,576
Trust me, apprentice.

227
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,993
Well, Kenobi, let's get out there

228
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:07,860
and see what riches have fallen
from the sky for me... and you.

229
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:11,502
Shall we?

230
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:14,240
Very well.

231
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:38,505
There's no sign of those two, boss.

232
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:43,545
Well, if the condition of
these goods is any indication,

233
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:46,482
ah, your friends have been vaporized.

234
00:19:46,517 --> 00:19:48,585
I wouldn't be so sure.

235
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,723
I cut one of them in half
once, and he survived.

236
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,925
Well, isn't that interesting?

237
00:20:01,197 --> 00:20:05,201
I think we have closure on
this matter, master Kenobi.

238
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:07,201
I disagree, Chancellor.

239
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:08,702
Everything we've learned from this

240
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:10,537
is that the Sith are persistent.

241
00:20:10,571 --> 00:20:12,371
They will not die.

242
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:15,475
I understand your
reservations, Master Kenobi,

243
00:20:15,509 --> 00:20:17,610
but I am afraid we can no longer allow

244
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:21,247
this personal matter of yours
to be a Republic concern.

245
00:20:21,281 --> 00:20:24,150
It does not appear this Darth Maul

246
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:26,454
is a direct threat to the Republic.

247
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:29,962
We need to redirect your
efforts to the cause at hand:

248
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:34,505
Stopping Count Dooku and
thus ending the Clone Wars.

249
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,942
Maul was trying to
build an army of pirates.

250
00:20:37,976 --> 00:20:39,443
So let him.

251
00:20:39,478 --> 00:20:41,546
Let him play with the rabble.

252
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,781
They're just petty crooks.

253
00:20:43,816 --> 00:20:45,784
It is of no relevance to the senate

254
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,121
compared to the Separatist threat.

255
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,925
Good day, gentlemen.

256
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:55,966
Something is stirring in the underworld.

257
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,502
The crime families have
had too much free rein

258
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:01,340
since the Jedi have been
distracted by the clone war.

259
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,611
I fear it is a fertile
place for Maul to flourish,

260
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,413
if he has indeed survived.

261
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:10,248
Hmm, right you may be, Obi-Wan,

262
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:13,554
but heed the words of
the Chancellor we must.

263
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:16,326
A personal matter this is for you.

264
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,829
Clouded your judgment may be.

265
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,333
In time, if he lives,

266
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:24,166
reveal himself again Maul will.

267
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:27,238
And then swiftly we shall act.

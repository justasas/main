1
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,570
Going somewhere, Solo?

2
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:07,898
It's too late.

3
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,948
You should have paid him
when you had the chance.

4
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:17,398
Jabba's put a price on your head so large every bounty
hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you...

5
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,068
I'm lucky I found you first.

6
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:25,146
If you give it to me,
I might forget I found you.

7
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,351
Jabba's through with you.

8
00:50:31,625 --> 00:50:36,609
He has no time for smugglers who drop their
shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

9
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,678
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

10
00:50:47,075 --> 00:50:48,498
That's the idea.

11
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,211
I've been looking forward
to this for a long time.

12
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,220
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

13
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,336
Have you now.

14
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,511
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

15
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,226
Why haven't you paid me...

16
00:53:04,575 --> 00:53:07,159
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

17
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,577
Han, I can't make exceptions.

18
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,798
What if everyone who
smuggled for me...

19
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,723
dropped their cargo
at the first sign...

20
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:24,823
of an Imperial starship?

21
00:53:24,825 --> 00:53:26,367
It's not good business.

22
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,396
Han, my boy, you're the best.

23
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,702
So, for an extra twenty percent...

24
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,725
Okay, fifteen percent.

25
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,750
But, if you fail me again...

26
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:57,298
I'll put a price on
your head so big...

27
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:01,311
you won't be able to go
near a civilized system.

28
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:06,974
Come on!

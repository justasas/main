Senator Amidala found the lab.

172
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,039
She sent us the coordinates
before she disappeared.

173

a geo-scan of the area.

-It looks like there are three entry points.

This appears to be the main lab.

-It is a risk we have to take.

182

Dr. Vindi and those bombs
must not leave the lab.

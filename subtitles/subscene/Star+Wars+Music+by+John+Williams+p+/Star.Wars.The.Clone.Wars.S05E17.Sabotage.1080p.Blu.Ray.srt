1
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,054
<i>Invasion!</i>

2
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:23,325
<i>The planet Cato Neimoidia
is under Separatist attack.</i>

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,597
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ashoka Tano,</i>

4
00:00:26,632 --> 00:00:29,334
<i>rush to the rescue as they lead
a squadron of starfighters</i>

5
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,672
<i>to the planet below.</i>

6
00:00:39,552 --> 00:00:42,023
Ahsoka, punch a hole
for the gunships to get through.

7
00:00:42,057 --> 00:00:43,926
I know the drill, Master.

8
00:01:07,698 --> 00:01:09,333
Look out, incoming missiles.

9
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:13,306
No problem.

10
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:18,281
Uh...
slight problem.

11
00:01:21,018 --> 00:01:22,520
Ahsoka, I've got buzz droids.

12
00:01:22,554 --> 00:01:23,655
How bad did you get hit?

13
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,023
I'm all clear.

14
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:26,226
What?

15
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,062
You always have it easy, Snips.

16
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,510
Good job, R2.

17
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:39,513
Someday these droids will learn
they keep messing

18
00:01:39,547 --> 00:01:40,982
with the wrong Jedi.

19
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:43,685
Looks like you're clear.

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,323
Just keep watching
and learning, Padawan.

21
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:49,293
Uh-oh.

22
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,462
You're trailing smoke.

23
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:51,496
What's wrong?

24
00:01:51,498 --> 00:01:53,233
Oh, nothing serious.

25
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:55,136
Just a small malfunction.

26
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,406
Ugh!

27
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:00,612
Master?

28
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:01,981
Master, come in.

29
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,884
R2, what's going on over there?

30
00:02:06,056 --> 00:02:07,391
Unconscious?

31
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,593
Fly back to the cruiser.

32
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,363
What do you mean there's something wrong

33
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,432
with the engines?

34
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,503
Tip your wing.
I'll see how bad it is.

35
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,412
Oh, that's not good.

36
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:24,417
Let's just say now would be
a good time to land.

37
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,660
R2, can you land the ship
on that cliff ledge?

38
00:02:31,263 --> 00:02:34,300
I don't care if the landing zone
is too short.

39
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,070
Get that ship on the ground.

40
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,475
R7, take over the ship.

41
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,445
I'm going after Anakin.

42
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,548
Somebody has to save his skin.

43
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:24,475
R2!

44
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:35,293
Ugh, very funny, R2.

45
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:37,763
Are you okay, Master?

46
00:03:37,798 --> 00:03:40,368
Yeah, what'd I miss?

47
00:03:40,402 --> 00:03:43,172
Oh, not much.

48
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,807
Wait a minute.
Wasn't I flying?

49
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:45,842
Where's my fighter?

50
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:47,212
How did I get here?

51
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,346
Fighter crashed.

52
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,381
I saved the day.

53
00:03:49,383 --> 00:03:50,588
You're welcome.

54
00:03:53,623 --> 00:03:55,693
Huh, all right.

55
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:01,134
Captain Rex,
Ahsoka and I need a little help.

56
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,503
Right away, sir.

57
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,254
Master Yoda.

58
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:16,593
<i>Return to the Jedi Temple
quickly, you should,</i>

59
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:17,828
<i>you and your Padawan.</i>

60
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,533
We're kind of busy, Master Yoda.

61
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:24,239
<i>The reason we need you,
important it is, Skywalker.</i>

62
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,910
<i>Bombed the Temple hangar, someone has.</i>

63
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:29,781
<i>Your assistance to find
the terrorist, we need.</i>

64
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:32,786
Who could successfully bomb
the Jedi Temple?

65
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:35,825
We'll be right there, Master.

66
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,845
How could the Separatists
infiltrate the Temple?

67
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,316
Worse than that it is.

68
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,819
What could be worse, Master Yoda?

69
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,929
Everything is on the table.

70
00:04:59,963 --> 00:05:01,532
We have to look at the possibility

71
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,937
that it could've been anyone
in the Temple, even a Jedi.

72
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,274
If a Jedi this is,

73
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,412
gone to the dark side they have.

74
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,217
I...
I can't believe a Jedi

75
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,754
would attack a place this sacred.

76
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:18,759
We'd like for you two to lead
the investigation.

77
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:22,532
We can't trust anyone
who was here, even a Jedi.

78
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:24,687
You and Ahsoka will provide
an impartial point of view

79
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:25,871
free of assumptions.

80
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,674
We'll do everything we can.

81
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,712
Careful you must be, Skywalker.

82
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,583
If willing to destroy the Temple
the attacker is,

83
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:36,955
to great lengths they will go
to keep from being caught.

84
00:05:36,989 --> 00:05:39,326
Then I guess we'll have to go
to even greater lengths

85
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:41,363
to catch him.

86
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,749
I can still hear the screams.

87
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,659
Do you believe what they said, Master,

88
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:54,697
that a Jedi could do this?

89
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:57,801
Not every Jedi agrees
with this war, Ahsoka.

90
00:05:57,836 --> 00:06:00,473
There are many
political idealists among us.

91
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,109
But a traitor?

92
00:06:02,143 --> 00:06:05,547
I'm afraid one can eventually
become the other.

93
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,386
Remember Count Dooku and General Krell.

94
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,821
That's how they started, too.

95
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:11,958
Only analysis and investigation

96
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:14,628
will prove what is true or not.

97
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:15,964
Who are you?

98
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,267
I am Russo-ISC,

99
00:06:18,301 --> 00:06:20,437
Crime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi.

100
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:24,443
I will be working with you
and your Padawan on this case.

101
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,015
I was assigned by Master Windu.

102
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,551
Okay, Russo,

103
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:31,421
you and Ahsoka should
begin the interviews.

104
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:35,327
I would rather interview
the witnesses alone.

105
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,332
Why?

106
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:40,368
Many of the wounded have heard rumors

107
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:42,504
a Jedi was behind this explosion.

108
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,613
There will be ill will toward you.

109
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:49,951
I think you're overexaggerating, Russo.

110
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:51,587
There were Jedi killed in that blast

111
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:53,856
along with maintenance crew and clones.

112
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,392
Take Ahsoka with you.

113
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:57,795
Let me know if you find anything.

114
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,364
I will, Master.

115
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:14,825
Did you notice anything unusual
about the hangar?

116
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,627
Not really.

117
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:19,031
Although, I left the
hangar five minutes before

118
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,367
the bomb exploded.

119
00:07:20,401 --> 00:07:22,905
Did everything seem okay before that?

120
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,310
Everything seemed normal.

121
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,248
Is it true a Jedi might be
responsible for the attack?

122
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:33,655
We're not certain of anything
at this point.

123
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:39,030
This distrust is troubling.

124
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:42,002
Some of these people have worked
in the Temple for years.

125
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:46,575
Fear makes even the most
trusting individual irrational.

126
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:51,616
I think I know who did it,
who blew up the hangar.

127
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:55,991
Who?

128
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,296
I believe it was Jackar Bowmani.

129
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:01,200
Jackar Bowmani.

130
00:08:01,234 --> 00:08:02,468
Who is Jackar?

131
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:05,039
One of the maintenance crew
in the hangar.

132
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:06,675
Why do you think it was him?

133
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,149
I passed him as I was going
on my shift change.

134
00:08:11,184 --> 00:08:13,353
He...
he had been working all morning

135
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,523
in the section the blast came from.

136
00:08:15,557 --> 00:08:17,759
It was the last place I saw him.

137
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,429
Is this him?

138
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,167
Yes.

139
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,439
I need to know, have you
seen him since the explosion?

140
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,942
No.

141
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:30,515
Truthfully, I didn't see much
of anything after the explosion.

142
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:32,854
Thank you.

143
00:08:39,598 --> 00:08:43,236
Looks like we need to find
Jackar Bowmani, Russo.

144
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,886
Did you find anything?

145
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,826
No, but the rumor about it
being a Jedi is growing, Ahsoka.

146
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,562
I can feel the anger and confusion

147
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,731
throughout the Jedi Temple.

148
00:08:59,765 --> 00:09:01,667
Russo and I have a lead.

149
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:04,906
We are looking for one of the
Temple workers, Jackar Bowmani.

150
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,809
One of the witnesses saw him in the area

151
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:09,615
where the bomb exploded
right before it happened,

152
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,421
and we have not been able
to find him anywhere.

153
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,191
Come on.
Nobody just disappears.

154
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:18,963
Unless it was well planned out.

155
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:21,634
Well, it had to be well
planned out to get past Jedi.

156
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:26,608
I'll talk to security.

157
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,344
No more clones.

158
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,847
Stop the violence.

159
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,383
End the war.

160
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:33,954
Stop the violence.

161
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:44,169
They're all family and friends?

162
00:09:44,204 --> 00:09:46,506
Yes, looking for answers.

163
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,176
So am I, Cin.

164
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,080
This is the guy who might be
behind all of this.

165
00:09:51,115 --> 00:09:53,317
If you see him, alert me immediately.

166
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,323
That is Jackar.

167
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,759
You know this man?

168
00:09:58,793 --> 00:10:00,394
He is my husband.

169
00:10:00,429 --> 00:10:03,233
I've been trying to reach him
since I heard of an explosion.

170
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,267
Where is he?

171
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,137
I need you to come with me.

172
00:10:13,249 --> 00:10:15,853
You have no idea where Jackar is?

173
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,055
No.

174
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:20,293
You are a Jedi, and you cannot find him?

175
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,564
I understand your frustration.

176
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:24,967
Don't.
Just find Jackar.

177
00:10:25,002 --> 00:10:28,840
Letta, do you think Jackar
could do something like this,

178
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,176
blow up the Temple?

179
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,613
Do you have any idea
what someone has to go through

180
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,917
to work in the Jedi Temple, hm?

181
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:38,089
Jackar dedicated his life
to serving the Jedi.

182
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:39,525
It had been his dream.

183
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,762
Not just anyone can walk into
your precious Temple.

184
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:45,233
He passed all the entry tests
that were needed.

185
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:47,637
Okay, I had to ask.

186
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:50,375
Unfortunately, everyone's a suspect.

187
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:52,946
Jackar would never do anything
like this.

188
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,084
Please, find him.

189
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,202
Hmm...

190
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:31,741
based on the trajectory of the debris,

191
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:35,680
it seems the blast came from there.

192
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:38,652
Why is there no bomb residue?

193
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:41,524
So you think whoever did this
triggered a ship to explode?

194
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:42,959
We think so.

195
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,531
Russo's trying to use the
shrapnel to determine that now.

196
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:49,302
The witness says he saw Jackar
in the area.

197
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:53,643
Maybe Jackar planned to do this
and just kept quiet.

198
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:54,777
Or...

199
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,382
It actually was a Jedi.

200
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,693
I found something, an anomaly,

201
00:12:04,727 --> 00:12:08,132
something that should not be here.

202
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,081
These pieces came from the blast origin.

203
00:12:19,116 --> 00:12:21,986
They are covered with microscopic droids

204
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,022
of a highly volatile nature.

205
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,527
Nano-droids.

206
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,900
Yes, nano-droids.

207
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,435
Great.

208
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,207
Now we're chasing nano-droids.

209
00:12:35,241 --> 00:12:37,176
Russo, go through security footage.

210
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,013
Try to see if Jackar went
to other parts of the Temple.

211
00:12:40,048 --> 00:12:42,451
Ahsoka, let's go find out
how Jackar got his hands

212
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:45,254
on these nano-droids.

213
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:54,301
Bowmani's file, Master Jedi.

214
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:56,805
He's a munitions expert.

215
00:12:56,839 --> 00:12:59,610
Jackar was the foreman over
all of the gunships,

216
00:12:59,644 --> 00:13:01,479
bombs, and weapons.

217
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,383
His specialty was nano-weaponry.

218
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:06,655
We've got to find this guy.

219
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:12,235
Isn't that going a little
too fast for you

220
00:13:12,264 --> 00:13:13,432
to make sense out of it?

221
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:15,002
It is simple data.

222
00:13:15,036 --> 00:13:19,141
At this pace, I am able to view
hundreds of hours of footage.

223
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:21,912
Have you found Jackar?

224
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:23,147
No.

225
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:26,085
I'll gather some Jedi
and search the Temple.

226
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,556
If he's still here, he might be
planning another attack.

227
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,791
Instead of Jedi,

228
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:32,563
I have droids
that can do the job much faster.

229
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,522
So you've found nothing so far?

230
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:51,191
We have a clue we're following.

231
00:13:51,226 --> 00:13:53,061
But we still don't have answers.

232
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,271
It is imperative
that the truth be found soon.

233
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,375
There are whispers
the Senate will have a meeting

234
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,345
to decide whether the military police

235
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:06,048
will need to become involved
in the investigation.

236
00:14:06,082 --> 00:14:07,684
They can't do that.

237
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,456
Clones died in that explosion,

238
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,225
maintenance clones working
on the gunships

239
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,627
as well as civilians.

240
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:17,699
The Senate tends to take notice
of these things

241
00:14:17,734 --> 00:14:20,638
no matter where they happen.

242
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,611
Master Skywalker, we have found Jackar.

243
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:28,115
Lock down all exits so he can't escape.

244
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,368
Where is he?

245
00:14:41,403 --> 00:14:45,041
Well, part of him is here.

246
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:47,945
I don't think now
is a good time to joke.

247
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:52,585
This is all that remains of Jackar.

248
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,021
His hand?

249
00:14:54,055 --> 00:14:57,092
The rest of him exploded.

250
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,608
Because he was so close to the bomb?

251
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:01,765
Because he <i>was</i> the bomb.

252
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,937
What's this?

253
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,606
The connection we were looking for

254
00:15:06,641 --> 00:15:09,078
to the explosion in the hangar.

255
00:15:09,112 --> 00:15:11,148
The nano-droids.

256
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:13,485
How did they get in his bloodstream?

257
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,690
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

258
00:15:16,725 --> 00:15:19,295
We're going to have to search
Jackar's home for evidence.

259
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,032
This is not the nicest place.

260
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:52,704
I would've thought working
for the Jedi paid better.

261
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,123
Letta?
Are you here?

262
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:08,062
You search for the droids,
but be careful,

263
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:11,468
and remember, he was a munitions expert.

264
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:14,473
I'd rather not set off
another explosion today.

265
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:16,677
I'll see if he left a note.

266
00:17:05,823 --> 00:17:06,826
Letta?

267
00:17:31,596 --> 00:17:34,434
Master.

268
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:37,539
The sensors are picking up
traces from the disposal.

269
00:17:39,042 --> 00:17:41,111
The nano-droids
were in the food.

270
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,414
Well, I guess the question now is,

271
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:46,353
did he eat them willingly,
or did someone feed them to him?

272
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:49,123
Wh-what are you doing here?

273
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:51,595
We've learned Jackar
was involved in the bombing.

274
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:52,964
That can't be true.

275
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:56,369
See if she has any nano-droids
on her, Ahsoka.

276
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,979
Nanodroids?

277
00:18:03,013 --> 00:18:04,081
She's clean.

278
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,785
What do you mean,
"nano-droids"?

279
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,158
We believe someone set Jackar
up and made him the bomb.

280
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:16,099
I...
I don't understand.

281
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,836
Letta, I want to bring you in
for more questioning.

282
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:23,877
Maybe you can help us make sense
out of all of this.

283
00:18:23,912 --> 00:18:27,450
I'll answer any question I can.

284
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:46,914
Letta, stop.

285
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,651
Letta!

286
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,259
Letta.

287
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,768
Take the high road.

288
00:18:58,802 --> 00:19:03,609
Right, Master.

289
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:34,022
Letta, stop!

290
00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:40,265
Let me go.

291
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,402
Running means you know more
than you're telling us.

292
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:43,837
Jackar is dead,

293
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,341
and now you're trying to blame
his murder on me.

294
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:49,414
Nobody ever said he was dead.

295
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,123
But running proves you had
something to do with the bomb.

296
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,394
You don't know what
you're talking about.

297
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,864
People blamed Jedi because of you.

298
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,403
People were killed because of you!

299
00:20:02,437 --> 00:20:04,439
You can't prove anything.

300
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:07,745
Did you feed the nano-droids
to Jackar?

301
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,781
You will answer me.

302
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,150
Now!

303
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,825
I did feed the nano-droids
to Jackar.

304
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,964
You set up your own husband to die?

305
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:23,102
You're dealing with things
you don't understand.

306
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:25,940
Oh, where you're going,

307
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:30,047
you'll have plenty of time
to explain everything.

308
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,979
We're holding Letta
in the cell below the temple

309
00:20:33,987 --> 00:20:36,423
to await further questioning.

310
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:39,594
<i>I am pleased to report
there were no other nano-droids</i>

311
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:42,099
<i>found in the sweep of the Temple.</i>

312
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:46,738
<i>I am also pleased to report,
based on the security footage,</i>

313
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:50,110
<i>Jackar Bowmani acted alone,</i>

314
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:54,016
<i>which means no Jedi was involved.</i>

315
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:55,151
Thanks, Russo.

316
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:57,254
Good job.

317
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:00,659
Did this woman say what her
reasons were for attacking us?

318
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,130
Not yet, but we're working on that.

319
00:21:03,164 --> 00:21:05,800
I think we can guess
her motives easily enough.

320
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,569
Public opinion is
swaying against the Jedi.

321
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:11,075
That is becoming clear.

322
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:14,915
This war is becoming less
and less popular

323
00:21:14,949 --> 00:21:16,918
every day it persists.

324
00:21:20,391 --> 00:21:23,128
Master, I'm relieved
we solved this case, but...

325
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:25,030
What if it had been a Jedi?

326
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:26,066
Yes.

327
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,422
I don't know how I would have felt

328
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,337
if a Jedi was really behind this.

329
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:33,812
There are going to be Jedi
who disappoint us, Ahsoka.

330
00:21:33,847 --> 00:21:36,115
But as long as we know
there are good Jedi

331
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,789
who fight for what's right,
it makes it all worthwhile.

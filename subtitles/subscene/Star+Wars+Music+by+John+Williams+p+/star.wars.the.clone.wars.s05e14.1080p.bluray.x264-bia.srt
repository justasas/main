1
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,978
Evil alliance!

2
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,231
Darth Maul and Savage Opress

3
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,400
escape Obi-Wan Kenobi's assault
once again.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:29,071
With their plan to build
a crime organization in peril,

5
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,032
the brothers' fate is about
to be changed forever

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,994
as they drift barely alive
through unknown space.

7
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,038
What are you?

8
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,999
Should we rub them out?

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,125
No.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,377
I want to hear their story.

11
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:29,131
If they're an enemy of the Jedi
then they're a friend of mine.

12
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,632
Load 'em up.

13
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,137
Savage.

14
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,983
You're not Jedi, so what are you?

15
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,407
We are Sith.

16
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,910
Do you serve Count Dooku?

17
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,079
I serve no one.

18
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:29,251
I thought there could only be two Sith,
a master and an apprentice?

19
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:35,257
We are brothers.
The true Lords of the Sith.

20
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,759
What happened to your ship?

21
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,762
Destroyed by Jedi.

22
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,347
Do you know which Jedi?

23
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,558
Kenobi.

24
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,606
And what do you seek now, Sith?

25
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:53,942
Fortune and power.

26
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,697
Repair this one's legs
and do what you can for the other.

27
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,073
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,625
Go on. Get moving.

29
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,968
In time for tea. Come join me.

30
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:30,812
Made with the florets of a Cassius tree.
It's good for your health.

31
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,279
Your mark?

32
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,450
The sign of Clan Vizsla. I am Pre Vizsla.

33
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:45,118
We are the Death Watch,

34
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,581
descendants of the true warrior faith
all Mandalorians once knew.

35
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:54,169
Now my people are living in exile
because we will not abandon our heritage.

36
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,465
Our people were warriors. Strong, feared.

37
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,176
Now they're ruled by the new Mandalorians

38
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,346
who think that being a pacifist
is a good thing.

39
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,475
They've given away our honor
and tradition for peace.

40
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,272
Duchess Satine and her corrupt leadership
are crushing our souls,

41
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,606
destroying our identity.

42
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,359
That is our struggle.

43
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,530
If they are weak, why do you wait?

44
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:26,660
The Duchess has powerful allies,
including your Jedi friend, Kenobi.

45
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,832
He is also responsible for our exile.

46
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,877
Perhaps fortune brought us together.

47
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,338
It is the will of the Force.

48
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,509
We can help you reclaim Mandalore.

49
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,596
And punish Kenobi for his trespasses.

50
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,602
We allied ourselves with Sith before.
Count Dooku, he betrayed us.

51
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:53,270
Sith are no better than Jedi.

52
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,272
They claim to be powerful,

53
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,942
but we put these two back together
after the Jedi gutted them.

54
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,280
Doubt will only lead to failure.

55
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,074
Hold!

56
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:12,456
Our combined strength will be rewarded.
Mandalore will be yours, and Kenobi,

57
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,125
this Sith pretender, Dooku,

58
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,463
and all our enemies will fall.

59
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,719
Check on your brother.
We'll put it to a vote.

60
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,620
Rest, apprentice. You're safe.

61
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:01,755
Our crash was discovered by enemies of
the Jedi, and we are in their care.

62
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:05,133
Are we prisoners?

63
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,468
No.

64
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,637
Allies.

65
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,807
They have much to offer,
including their planet.

66
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:17,104
They are strong, and unlike pirates,
they possess honor.

67
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,439
Another weakness.

68
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:25,487
They know nothing of our intentions.
Those revelations will come too late.

69
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,121
I see you have your strength back.

70
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,007
I never got your names.

71
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,510
I am Maul, this is Savage.

72
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:53,056
Our brothers are in favor of an alliance
to liberate Mandalore.

73
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:58,854
This Duchess of yours will soon discover
the true burden of peace.

74
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,535
Your people are strong and skilled,

75
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:17,039
but you will need an army
to free Mandalore.

76
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,250
There are more on Mandalore
who will join us.

77
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,377
Their help would come too late.

78
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:26,423
We can assemble an army
beginning with the Black Sun.

79
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:30,385
They're a crime syndicate.
Hardly a force to rally with.

80
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,096
The can provide us with
the resources we need

81
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:37,851
to sustain a war without the scrutiny
of the Republic.

82
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,821
A battalion, Brother.

83
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,782
They will serve us well.

84
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:40,122
We request an audience with your leaders.

85
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,416
It'll be your funeral.

86
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,480
Why do you come here?

87
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,941
We seek an army.

88
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:11,528
Fools. We are not mercenaries.

89
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,991
Dispose of them.
Keep their ships and weapons.

90
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,160
Give me that one's sword.

91
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,676
This is your last opportunity to join us.

92
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,844
Quiet!

93
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,680
We are the Black Sun!

94
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,854
Hmm.

95
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:47,856
Very well, then.

96
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:09,878
It would seem the decision
to join us is now yours.

97
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:14,132
After careful consideration,
we will join you.

98
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,260
Show us your supplies.

99
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,946
We have our army now.
I have a plan to undermine Satine.

100
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:41,326
The army is weak.
We are not ready for the Duchess.

101
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,955
With my plan,
we won't need a bigger force.

102
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,418
There is only one plan, one vision.

103
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:52,629
And it belongs to Death Watch.

104
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,007
Your vision lacks clarity.

105
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:00,679
Without us, you have no army
and no reason to replace the Duchess.

106
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:08,270
The depth of this opportunity eludes you.
You shall watch and learn.

107
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,346
More criminals.

108
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:46,350
Spice dealers connected
to all the crime families of Coruscant.

109
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:50,354
The Pykes. They will be the next to join us.

110
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,858
We know you've been forming an army.

111
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,486
Were you expecting us?

112
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:02,991
Underworld's a small community.
I have no desire to oppose you.

113
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:05,494
We come to join you.

114
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:08,914
Very good.

115
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:13,168
Then ready our troops.
We leave for Nal Hutta immediately.

116
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:33,856
There are many things the Hutts influence
and possess that would be useful to us.

117
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,110
We have no credits.

118
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:47,870
Your lives, in exchange for Hutt space
and everything in its borders.

119
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,997
I see negotiations have gone as planned.

120
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,499
Secure this platform.

121
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,561
Retreat! Retreat! Back inside!

122
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:18,770
Hey!

123
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,035
Come on, let's get out of here!

124
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:24,503
Let them go. They're only bounty hunters,
they have no allegiance.

125
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,515
Sir, the Hutts have escaped. Except one.

126
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,437
Where are the others?

127
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,987
Kill him.

128
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,154
Oh!

129
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:58,328
Give me a location.

130
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,790
Tatooine, Tatooine!

131
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,042
Jabba's palace.

132
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:11,258
So the only thing that you can tell me
is that I will find Jabba at Jabba's palace?

133
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:38,053
Give up, Jabba, you're the only ones left.

134
00:19:39,388 --> 00:19:41,557
Submit or suffer.

135
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:55,487
The mighty Jabba and the Hutt families
have decided to join you.

136
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,588
Between the Hutts, Black Sun,
and the Pykes,

137
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,799
we'll have a large reserve
of muscle and supplies.

138
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:16,967
Yes.

139
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,721
Then Mandalore and Kenobi
are still our priority?

140
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:22,723
They are vital.

141
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,642
I'm curious to hear the rest of your plan.

142
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:30,439
The vision has expanded.
You will still rule Mandalore,

143
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,402
and under your protection,
I will command a new galactic underworld.

144
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:44,286
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

145
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,915
It gives you a great deal of options
for your enterprise.

146
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,084
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

147
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:56,590
With their combined forces, the Republic
and the Separatists will be irrelevant.

148
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:58,300
Then, are we ready?

149
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,679
Mobilize the army.
Send an advance guard to the capital.

150
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:06,767
I want a list of targets vital
to Mandalore's security.

151
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:11,104
Choose wisely.
There will be no second chances.

152
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:25,828
Stay focused.
Mandalore will soon be ours,

153
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:29,998
and Maul and his brother will be dead
alongside the Duchess.

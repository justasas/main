00:00:16,503 --> 00:00:18,838
Male announcer:
Ahsoka Tano on the run!

3
00:00:18,905 --> 00:00:20,873
After an attack on the Jedi Temple,

4
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,076
Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan
found herself accused

5
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:27,446
of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.

6
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:30,749
With no choice but to run,
she was chased by her master,

7
00:00:30,817 --> 00:00:33,551
who begged her to turn herself in.

8
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:37,021
Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,

9
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:39,057
Ahsoka decided to find out the truth

10
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:42,994
and prove her innocence on her own.

11
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,233
After further investigation,
there can be little doubt

12
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,502
that the clone officers
murdered in the escape

13
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:54,672
were killed by none other
than Ahsoka Tano herself.

14
00:00:54,739 --> 00:00:56,039
She used a Jedi mind trick

15
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,208
to convince the clone to open the door

16
00:00:58,276 --> 00:00:59,876
and then proceeded to cut him down

17
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:02,379
along with five other clones
along the way.

18
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:07,951
I do not believe that Ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

19
00:01:08,019 --> 00:01:10,953
The beliefs of
the Jedi Council are irrelevant.

20
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:13,689
We deal strictly in facts and evidence,

21
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:16,325
and the evidence points
to Padawan Tano being guilty

22
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,826
of the attack on the temple

23
00:01:17,894 --> 00:01:19,761
and the murder of the Republic officers.

24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,862
This is sedition.

25
00:01:25,366 --> 00:01:28,834
Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your Padawan

26
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:30,869
before she escaped?

27
00:01:30,937 --> 00:01:32,771
No, Master Mundi.

28
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,006
The Council believes that Ahsoka

29
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:37,074
may be guilty of the crime,

30
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:39,477
still believe they are wrong,
do you, hmm?

31
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,146
I believe she didn't kill
the clone troopers

32
00:01:42,213 --> 00:01:43,780
or the woman
who used the nano-droids

33
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:45,148
to blow up the temple.

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,716
That's why she's running.

35
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:48,418
To prove her innocence.

36
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:50,319
Now she's in the lower depths.

37
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:53,756
With her skills,
she will be hard to find.

38
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,025
Two teams we will send.

39
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,927
Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon,

40
00:01:58,995 --> 00:02:01,096
with clones you will go.

41
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:05,067
I think it would be best
if Skywalker stayed here.

42
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:09,605
Having you involved
may actually make things worse.

43
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,475
Master Windu, with all due respect,

44
00:02:12,543 --> 00:02:14,644
she is my Padawan.

45
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:17,580
The reason for you not to go.

46
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,715
I think we're being foolish

47
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:21,351
if we take Anakin off this mission.

48
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:22,652
Who knows her better?

49
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,254
He's emotionally tied to her.

50
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,656
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

51
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,858
I'd rather capture Ahsoka
and find out the truth

52
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,161
then let her run because of a lie.

53
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:34,699
You must prove to us
that you will stay focused.

54
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:36,033
Can you?

55
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,670
I've already alerted security
on the lower levels

56
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:42,341
to be on the lookout for Ahsoka.

57
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:46,645
Go swiftly then, Skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

58
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:49,181
before it is too late.

59
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:51,116
Yes, Master.

60
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:28,655
This one just came in.

61
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:31,925
Looks like the Jedi
are after one of their own.

62
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,032
She's armed and dangerous.

63
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,029
Alert all units.

64
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,764
You heard him.

65
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:57,317
Barriss, it's Ahsoka.

66
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,786
Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe.

67
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:03,123
- Safe but on the run.
- Where?

68
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,324
I can't tell you,

69
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:06,926
but someone is definitely trying
to frame me.

70
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,314
It's not safe for you to call me

71
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:10,062
using the Jedi communicator.

72
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,964
Find another way to contact me.

73
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:13,232
I will.

74
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,820
In the meantime, I'll do some digging

75
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,269
and see if I can find anything out

76
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,870
to help you on my end.

77
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:18,871
Thank you, Barriss.

78
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,773
Be safe.

79
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,009
[grunting and laughing]

80
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:34,054
Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

81
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:36,758
Yeah.

82
00:04:36,826 --> 00:04:38,026
Let's make a trade.

83
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,529
[nickering]

84
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:41,930
[sniffing]

85
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:44,366
What do you want?

86
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,934
Your cloak.

87
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,244
Passes, please.

88
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:29,313
Passes, please.

89
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:35,485
Passes, please.

90
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,831
That's her.
The rogue Jedi.

91
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:48,965
[electronic dinging]

92
00:05:50,301 --> 00:05:52,702
[train engine whirring]

93
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,770
All units respond.

94
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:55,672
We have located the rogue Jedi.

95
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,707
- Uh.
- Whoa.

96
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:02,512
- Ah!
- Oh.

97
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,714
Get out of the way.
Look out!

98
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,250
- [babbling]
- Stop her!

99
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:09,185
I've got her.

100
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,889
Ah!

101
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,057
[speaking Rodese]

102
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,324
Ugh.

103
00:06:15,392 --> 00:06:16,325
- Look out.
- Ah.

104
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,695
- Whoa.
- Ah!

105
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:28,438
[gurgling]

106
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:32,208
<i>Dupa-la zuga lu!</i>

107
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:33,276
Sir, look!

108
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,979
Stop!

109
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:45,554
[blasters firing]

110
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:47,255
[electronic crackling and chiming]

111
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,756
Not good.

112
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:55,061
[frantic panting]

113
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,063
Don't worry, little guy,
I'll get us out of this.

114
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,800
I'll--I'll think of something.

115
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,402
Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof.

116
00:07:06,904 --> 00:07:09,838
<i>Ya kumay na.
Ya kumay na.</i>

117
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:11,073
<i>Almost there.
Kumay na.</i>

118
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,109
<i>Almost got it.
Kumay na.</i>

119
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,176
<i>Kumay na.</i>

120
00:07:18,446 --> 00:07:19,646
<i>Kumay na.</i>

121
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,247
Huh.

122
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:25,919
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

123
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,831
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

124
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,243
The lower level police claim
to have spotted Commander Tano

125
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,380
heading to level 1312.

126
00:08:08,448 --> 00:08:10,683
All right, let's bring her home.

127
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,731
[squeaking]

128
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:43,883
Uh!

129
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,718
[lightsabers humming]

130
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:48,221
Well, well, I didn't believe it

131
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:49,756
when I first heard it,

132
00:08:49,823 --> 00:08:51,691
but I guess it's true,

133
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:55,494
the Senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

134
00:08:55,562 --> 00:08:57,596
[chuckling]

135
00:08:57,664 --> 00:08:59,999
And I'm going to be the one
who collects.

136
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:03,669
Ventress, it was you, wasn't it?

137
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:07,373
You were behind all of this,
and you framed me!

138
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:09,875
I don't know what you're talking about.

139
00:09:09,943 --> 00:09:13,011
Yes, you do!

140
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:16,814
So what are you now, a bounty hunter?

141
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:20,852
Yes, and someone who knows
how to make easy money.

142
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:33,261
You think
you're just gonna hand me over?

143
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:36,197
And then what?
Get a pat on the shoulder?

144
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:38,431
You're Separatist war criminal
and a Sith.

145
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,267
They'll have us both in prison
before you said your name.

146
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,869
I don't have to hand you
over to the Jedi.

147
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:45,503
I can hand you over to the bondsman

148
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,205
and still get paid.

149
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:51,141
I'm gonna get my money
whether you're dead or alive.

150
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:52,909
Heh, good luck.

151
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:55,812
Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi.

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,316
I'm afraid the other Jedi
no longer see it that way.

153
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:03,886
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

154
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,055
That's why I'm going to need your help.

155
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:11,627
In what star system do you
think I would ever help you?

156
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,396
A traitorous Jedi tried
to blow up the Jedi Temple

157
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:17,099
and has framed me for that
and other killings.

158
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:21,237
Mmm, so the Jedi
aren't that holy after all.

159
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,307
I know Dooku tried to have you killed.

160
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,710
I know he betrayed you.

161
00:10:26,778 --> 00:10:28,979
What if this is his new apprentice?

162
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,347
I've fallen from my path

163
00:10:30,415 --> 00:10:32,350
just as you've fallen from yours.

164
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,786
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

165
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:39,290
What can you offer me
that's better than money?

166
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,127
If you help me,
I'll speak to the Council

167
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:44,296
and the Senate on your behalf.

168
00:10:44,364 --> 00:10:47,066
I'll get you a full pardon
for your crimes.

169
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:49,235
You have my attention.

170
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:52,405
But I'm going to go
where the tide flows.

171
00:10:52,473 --> 00:10:55,441
If the tide is flowing against you,

172
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:59,712
don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

173
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,081
Fair enough.

174
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,852
I suggest we find
somewhere else to discuss this.

175
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:08,414
Shine the light over there.

176
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,191
Stay where you are!

177
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,714
Ventress.

178
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,416
Send out the probes.

179
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:39,051
I want them found now!

180
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:42,121
[droids buzzing]

181
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:51,130
Nice place you have here.

182
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:52,765
Not everyone on Coruscant

183
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:56,402
lives in a luxurious temple
on the surface.

184
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,538
I guess I'll have to get used to that.

185
00:11:58,606 --> 00:12:00,573
Just make the call.

186
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:11,450
Adding another criminal act
to your record?

187
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:15,154
I don't want them
to be able to trace it.

188
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:16,889
Barriss, it's me.

189
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:20,625
It's so good to see you, Ahsoka.

190
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:21,660
Are you okay?

191
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,128
Yeah, I'm okay,

192
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:25,464
if you consider Anakin
and a hundred clones on my tail

193
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:26,931
a good space to be in.

194
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,466
You were almost captured?

195
00:12:28,534 --> 00:12:30,335
Once or twice, yeah.

196
00:12:30,403 --> 00:12:31,470
Where are you?

197
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:33,405
I can't say, Barriss.

198
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,207
I believe I've found a clue.

199
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,575
A clue?

200
00:12:36,643 --> 00:12:38,344
How?
From where?

201
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:39,912
We don't have much time, Ahsoka.

202
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,281
[droid buzzing]

203
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:44,950
Fine, I'm on level 1312.

204
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:48,020
[droid buzzing]

205
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:51,157
A holo-booth
at the corner of 12th and G.

206
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,658
Got it.

207
00:12:52,726 --> 00:12:55,661
Three levels up there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

208
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,096
where they used to build munitions

209
00:12:57,163 --> 00:12:59,331
that Letta visited during
the time she was getting access

210
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:00,599
to the nano-droids.

211
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,468
How did you find this out?

212
00:13:02,535 --> 00:13:04,503
I told you I would do some checking.

213
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,505
Ah, thank you, Barriss.

214
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,908
Be careful, Ahsoka.

215
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,914
Well?

216
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:17,583
I think I have a lead.

217
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:27,026
It doesn't seem like you need my help.

218
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:28,294
That's not true.

219
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:30,396
We need to find
an abandoned munitions warehouse

220
00:13:30,464 --> 00:13:31,998
on level 1315.

221
00:13:32,066 --> 00:13:34,734
We should be able to find
some information there.

222
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:40,374
You know the place
I'm talking about, don't you?

223
00:13:40,442 --> 00:13:41,609
Yes.

224
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:43,311
I can get you there.

225
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,381
[footsteps]

226
00:13:50,252 --> 00:13:51,386
Listen to me.

227
00:13:51,453 --> 00:13:53,721
I don't want to fight.

228
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,524
I do.

229
00:13:56,592 --> 00:13:58,493
We're taking you in now, Commander.

230
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,763
That's not gonna happen, trust me.

231
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,432
Now I'm not going to hurt
any of you--

232
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,869
we're not going to hurt
any of you--

233
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:10,405
but you're not taking me in.

234
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,975
Commander, we are taking you in.

235
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:16,143
[lightsabers humming]

236
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,144
Let's play.

237
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:18,379
Take 'em out.
Ah!

238
00:14:18,447 --> 00:14:19,487
Take her out.
Take her out.

239
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:20,881
Ventress, don't.

240
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,017
Look out!
Ugh!

241
00:14:27,121 --> 00:14:28,287
They'll cut us down!

242
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,489
Oh!

243
00:14:29,556 --> 00:14:30,556
Watch it!

244
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:33,559
Take a shot.

245
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:37,195
Too fast.

246
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:44,667
Arg.

247
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,302
[snarling]

248
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,072
Ah, oh.

249
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,945
See?

250
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,248
Didn't kill one.

251
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:01,350
It's the new me.

252
00:15:04,887 --> 00:15:07,789
General Plo Koon, we had Commander Tano,

253
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:11,125
but she escaped
with the help of Asajj Ventress.

254
00:15:20,448 --> 00:15:21,915
There it is.

255
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,818
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

256
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:37,064
I've done my part of the bargain,

257
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:39,567
which means you're on your own
from here.

258
00:15:39,635 --> 00:15:41,035
But don't forget,

259
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,637
you have to speak on my behalf now.

260
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,072
That was the deal.

261
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,473
Agreed.

262
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,176
Thanks for getting this far, at least.

263
00:15:49,244 --> 00:15:51,011
I have to admit,

264
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:55,916
I never saw us
doing anything together ever.

265
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:59,286
These are strange times.

266
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:24,580
[distant clattering]

267
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:31,153
I thought we decided
we were going to part ways.

268
00:16:37,761 --> 00:16:40,762
[squeaking]

269
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:46,735
Ugh, ah!

270
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:52,606
[groaning]

271
00:16:57,911 --> 00:16:58,911
Ah!

272
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,519
[gasps]

273
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,263
How am I supposed to find a clue

274
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:25,365
when I don't even know
what I'm looking for?

275
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:31,504
[lightsabers crackling]

276
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:32,572
Uh!

277
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:45,716
Ventress!

278
00:17:45,784 --> 00:17:47,818
I see you've had a change of heart.

279
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:53,590
[coughing]

280
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:03,765
Why bring me here?

281
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,200
Answer me, Ventress.

282
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,267
Why?

283
00:18:12,073 --> 00:18:15,074
[lightsabers humming and cracking]

284
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,413
[groaning]

285
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,606
Ah!

286
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,942
[steam hissing]

287
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,150
[explosion]

288
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,090
Calling all units.

289
00:19:12,158 --> 00:19:15,126
Suspicious activity on level 1315.

290
00:19:35,414 --> 00:19:36,981
Ugh.

291
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:45,723
[coughing]

292
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:06,677
Nano-droids?

293
00:20:13,852 --> 00:20:15,820
No, Wolffe, let me explain.

294
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,321
[stun blaster firing]

295
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,837
Explosives.

296
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,739
These are the same types
of nano-droids

297
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:37,708
that were used to blow up
the Jedi Temple.

298
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,577
I can't believe it.

299
00:20:47,719 --> 00:20:49,453
Captured she has been?

300
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:51,422
Yes, Master Yoda.

301
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,024
Without incident?

302
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:55,727
No, she was subdued by the clones

303
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:59,965
and found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

304
00:21:00,032 --> 00:21:02,968
It still doesn't explain
Ventress' involvement.

305
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,237
We saw her with Ahsoka.

306
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,640
I think there's more going on
than we know.

307
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,877
By Ahsoka or against her?

308
00:21:10,944 --> 00:21:13,145
That remains to be seen.

309
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:14,880
We're bringing her back to the temple.

310
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:17,716
Let's just hope we can keep her here.

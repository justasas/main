This assassin,
I've never faced an adversary like her.

A clone like you would never understand.

195
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,509
I wanted a life
with more than empty servitude.

196
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,178
And for that you'd betray the Republic?

197
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,180
Like I told the Padawan,

198
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:23,351

I'll tell him myself.

Greetings, Viceroy.

<i>Troubling is the treachery of</i>
<i>the Senate guard, Captain Argyus.</i>

<i>Revealed all around us our enemies are.</i>

225

226
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,006
Gunray and his accomplices stole
a Republic ship to make their getaway.

227

<i>-It could be tracked!</i>
-Indeed.

<i>but powerful allies he has.</i>

<i>Swiftly we must move</i>
<i>if we are to recapture him.</i>

230
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,812
Master Fisto's fleet
was near Gunray's position.

231
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,356
I've already contacted him
to follow the signal.

00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,566
<i>Ahsoka, I'll meet you</i>
<i>at the rendezvous point.</i>

Yes, Master.

Master Luminara,
I guess this is goodbye for now.

I owe you my life, Ahsoka.

236
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,289
Protecting a Jedi Master
is the role of a Padawan.

237
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,083
And teaching is usually
the role of the Master.

238
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,586
Master Skywalker should be proud.

239
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,215
-Farewell.
-Thank you, Master.

240
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,013

1
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,980
<i>Ahsoka Tano on the run!</i>

2
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,015
<i>After an attack on the Jedi Temple,</i>

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:26,217
<i>Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan
found herself accused</i>

4
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:29,587
<i>of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.</i>

5
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,890
<i>With no choice but to run,
she was chased by her master,</i>

6
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,691
<i>who begged her to turn herself in.</i>

7
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,161
<i>Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,</i>

8
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:41,197
<i>Ahsoka decided to find out the truth</i>

9
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:45,133
<i>and prove her innocence on her own.</i>

10
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:51,372
<i>After further investigation,
there can be little doubt</i>

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,641
<i>that the clone officers
murdered in the escape</i>

12
00:00:53,708 --> 00:00:56,810
<i>were killed by none other
than Ahsoka Tano herself.</i>

13
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:58,177
<i>She used a Jedi mind trick</i>

14
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,346
<i>to convince the clone to open the door</i>

15
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:02,014
<i>and then proceeded to cut him down</i>

16
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:04,516
<i>along with five other clones
along the way.</i>

17
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:10,088
I do not believe that Ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

18
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:13,090
<i>The beliefs of
the Jedi Council are irrelevant.</i>

19
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:15,825
<i>We deal strictly in facts and evidence,</i>

20
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:18,461
<i>and the evidence points
to Padawan Tano being guilty</i>

21
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:19,962
<i>of the attack on the temple</i>

22
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,897
<i>and the murder of the Republic officers.</i>

23
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:23,997
<i>This is sedition.</i>

24
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:30,969
Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your Padawan

25
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,004
before she escaped?

26
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:34,905
No, Master Mundi.

27
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:37,140
The Council believes that Ahsoka

28
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,208
may be guilty of the crime,

29
00:01:39,276 --> 00:01:41,611
still believe they are wrong,
do you, hmm?

30
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,279
I believe she didn't kill
the clone troopers

31
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:45,913
or the woman
who used the nano-droids

32
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,281
to blow up the temple.

33
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:48,849
That's why she's running.

34
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:50,551
To prove her innocence.

35
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,452
Now she's in the lower depths.

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,888
With her skills,
she will be hard to find.

37
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,157
Two teams we will send.

38
00:01:58,224 --> 00:02:01,059
Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon,

39
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:03,228
with clones you will go.

40
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:07,198
I think it would be best
if Skywalker stayed here.

41
00:02:07,266 --> 00:02:11,736
Having you involved
may actually make things worse.

42
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:14,605
Master Windu, with all due respect,

43
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:16,774
she is <i>my</i> Padawan.

44
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:19,710
The reason for you not to go.

45
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:20,859
I think we're being foolish

46
00:02:20,913 --> 00:02:23,481
if we take Anakin off this mission.

47
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:24,781
Who knows her better?

48
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:26,383
He's emotionally tied to her.

49
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,785
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

50
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:30,987
I'd rather capture Ahsoka
and find out the truth

51
00:02:31,055 --> 00:02:33,290
then let her run because of a lie.

52
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:36,827
You must prove to us
that you will stay focused.

53
00:02:36,894 --> 00:02:38,161
Can you?

54
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,798
I've already alerted security
on the lower levels

55
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:44,468
to be on the lookout for Ahsoka.

56
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:48,772
Go swiftly then, Skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,308
before it is too late.

58
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,243
Yes, Master.

59
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,778
This one just came in.

60
00:03:30,846 --> 00:03:34,048
Looks like the Jedi
are after one of their own.

61
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,155
She's armed and dangerous.

62
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,151
Alert all units.

63
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,886
You heard him.

64
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,437
Barriss, it's Ahsoka.

65
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,906
Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe.

66
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:05,242
- Safe but on the run.
- Where?

67
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:06,443
I can't tell you,

68
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,045
but someone is definitely trying
to frame me.

69
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,433
It's not safe for you to call me

70
00:04:10,447 --> 00:04:12,181
using the Jedi communicator.

71
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:14,083
Find another way to contact me.

72
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,350
I will.

73
00:04:15,418 --> 00:04:16,938
In the meantime, I'll do some digging

74
00:04:16,953 --> 00:04:18,387
and see if I can find anything out

75
00:04:18,455 --> 00:04:19,988
to help you on my end.

76
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,056
Thank you, Barriss.

77
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,891
Be safe.

78
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,170
Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

79
00:04:36,238 --> 00:04:38,874
Yeah.

80
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:40,142
Let's make a trade.

81
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:46,481
What do you want?

82
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:48,049
Your cloak.

83
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:29,355
Passes, please.

84
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,424
Passes, please.

85
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:37,595
Passes, please.

86
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,940
That's her.
The rogue Jedi.

87
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,879
All units respond.

88
00:05:55,946 --> 00:05:57,780
We have located the rogue Jedi.

89
00:05:57,848 --> 00:05:59,815
- Uh.
- Whoa.

90
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:04,620
- Ah!
- Oh.

91
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,821
Get out of the way.
Look out!

92
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,357
Stop her!

93
00:06:09,425 --> 00:06:11,292
I've got her.

94
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,063
Ah!

95
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,430
Ugh.

96
00:06:17,498 --> 00:06:18,498
- Look out.
- Ah.

97
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:20,801
- Whoa.
- Ah!

98
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:34,313
<i>Dupa-la zuga lu!</i>

99
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:35,381
Sir, look!

100
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:39,084
Stop!

101
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:50,859
Not good.

102
00:06:57,231 --> 00:07:00,165
Don't worry, little guy,
I'll get us out of this.

103
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:04,902
I'll... I'll think of something.

104
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,503
Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof.

105
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,939
<i>Ya kumay na.</i>
<i>Ya kumay na.</i>

106
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,174
Almost there.
<i>Kumay na.</i>

107
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:16,209
Almost got it.
<i>Kumay na.</i>

108
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:17,276
<i>Kumay na.</i>

109
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:21,746
<i>Kumay na.</i>

110
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,347
Huh.

111
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:28,018
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

112
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:40,929
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

113
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:08,338
The lower level police claim
to have spotted Commander Tano

114
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:10,475
heading to level 1312.

115
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,778
All right, let's bring her home.

116
00:08:45,008 --> 00:08:46,008
Uh!

117
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,312
Well, well, I didn't believe it

118
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:51,847
when I first heard it,

119
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:53,782
but I guess it's true,

120
00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:57,584
the Senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

121
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:02,089
And I'm going to be the one
who collects.

122
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:05,759
Ventress, it was you, wasn't it?

123
00:09:05,827 --> 00:09:09,462
You were behind all of this,
and you framed me!

124
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,964
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:09:12,032 --> 00:09:15,100
Yes, you do!

126
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:18,902
So what are you now, a bounty hunter?

127
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,940
Yes, and someone who knows
how to make easy money.

128
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,348
You think
you're just gonna hand me over?

129
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,283
And then what?
Get a pat on the shoulder?

130
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,517
You're Separatist war criminal
and a Sith.

131
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:43,353
They'll have us both in prison
before you said your name.

132
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:45,955
I don't have to hand you
over to the Jedi.

133
00:09:46,022 --> 00:09:47,588
I can hand you over to the bondsman

134
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:49,290
and still get paid.

135
00:09:49,357 --> 00:09:53,226
I'm gonna get my money
whether you're dead or alive.

136
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,994
Heh, good luck.

137
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,896
Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi.

138
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm afraid the other Jedi
no longer see it that way.

139
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:05,970
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

140
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:09,138
That's why I'm going to need your help.

141
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:13,710
In what star system do you
think I would ever help you?

142
00:10:13,777 --> 00:10:16,478
A traitorous Jedi tried
to blow up the Jedi Temple

143
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:19,181
and has framed me for that
and other killings.

144
00:10:19,249 --> 00:10:23,319
Mmm, so the Jedi
aren't that holy after all.

145
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:26,388
I know Dooku tried to have you killed.

146
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:28,791
I know he betrayed you.

147
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,060
What if this is his new apprentice?

148
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,428
I've fallen from my path

149
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:34,431
just as you've fallen from yours.

150
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,866
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

151
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:41,370
What can you offer me
that's better than money?

152
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:44,207
If you help me,
I'll speak to the Council

153
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,375
and the Senate on your behalf.

154
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:49,145
I'll get you a full pardon
for your crimes.

155
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,314
You have my attention.

156
00:10:51,381 --> 00:10:54,484
But I'm going to go
where the tide flows.

157
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,519
If the tide is flowing against you,

158
00:10:57,587 --> 00:11:01,790
don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

159
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:04,159
Fair enough.

160
00:11:04,227 --> 00:11:07,929
I suggest we find
somewhere else to discuss this.

161
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,491
Shine the light over there.

162
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,268
Stay where you are!

163
00:11:34,787 --> 00:11:36,788
Ventress.

164
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:39,490
Send out the probes.

165
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,125
I want them found now!

166
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,203
Nice place you have here.

167
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:54,838
Not everyone on Coruscant

168
00:11:54,906 --> 00:11:58,474
lives in a luxurious temple
on the surface.

169
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,610
I guess I'll have to get used to that.

170
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,645
Just make the call.

171
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,521
Adding another criminal act
to your record?

172
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:17,224
I don't want them
to be able to trace it.

173
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,959
Barriss, it's me.

174
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:22,695
It's so good to see you, Ahsoka.

175
00:12:22,763 --> 00:12:23,763
Are you okay?

176
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:25,198
Yeah, I'm okay,

177
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:27,533
if you consider Anakin
and a hundred clones on my tail

178
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,000
a good space to be in.

179
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:30,535
You were almost captured?

180
00:12:30,603 --> 00:12:32,404
Once or twice, yeah.

181
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,539
Where are you?

182
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,474
I can't say, Barriss.

183
00:12:35,542 --> 00:12:37,275
I believe I've found a clue.

184
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,643
A clue?

185
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:40,412
How?
From where?

186
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,980
We don't have much time, Ahsoka.

187
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:47,017
Fine, I'm on level 1312.

188
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:53,224
A holo-booth
at the corner of 12th and G.

189
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,725
Got it.

190
00:12:54,793 --> 00:12:57,727
Three levels up there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

191
00:12:57,795 --> 00:12:59,162
where they used to build munitions

192
00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:01,397
that Letta visited during
the time she was getting access

193
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:02,665
to the nano-droids.

194
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,534
How did you find this out?

195
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,569
I told you I would do some checking.

196
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,570
Ah, thank you, Barriss.

197
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,973
Be careful, Ahsoka.

198
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,978
Well?

199
00:13:18,046 --> 00:13:19,647
I think I have a lead.

200
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,089
It doesn't seem like you need my help.

201
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,357
That's not true.

202
00:13:30,425 --> 00:13:32,459
We need to find
an abandoned munitions warehouse

203
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,061
on level 1315.

204
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:36,797
We should be able to find
some information there.

205
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,436
You know the place
I'm talking about, don't you?

206
00:13:42,504 --> 00:13:43,671
Yes.

207
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,373
I can get you there.

208
00:13:52,313 --> 00:13:53,447
Listen to me.

209
00:13:53,514 --> 00:13:55,782
I don't want to fight.

210
00:13:57,384 --> 00:13:58,584
I do.

211
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,553
We're taking you in now, Commander.

212
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,823
That's not gonna happen, trust me.

213
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,492
Now I'm not going to hurt
any of you...

214
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,928
we're not going to hurt
any of you...

215
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:12,464
but you're not taking me in.

216
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,034
Commander, we are taking you in.

217
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:19,269
Let's play.

218
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,437
Take 'em out.
Ah!

219
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:21,545
Take her out.
Take her out.

220
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:22,939
Ventress, don't.

221
00:14:24,808 --> 00:14:26,075
Look out!
Ugh!

222
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,344
They'll cut us down!

223
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,546
Oh!

224
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:32,613
Watch it!

225
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:35,616
Take a shot.

226
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:39,251
Too fast.

227
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,790
Arg.

228
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:52,127
Ah, oh.

229
00:14:57,632 --> 00:14:58,999
See?

230
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,302
Didn't kill one.

231
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,404
It's the new me.

232
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:09,842
General Plo Koon, we had Commander Tano,

233
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,178
but she escaped
with the help of Asajj Ventress.

234
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,067
There it is.

235
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:23,970
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

236
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:36,215
I've done my part of the bargain,

237
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:38,717
which means you're on your own
from here.

238
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,185
But don't forget,

239
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,787
you have to speak on my behalf now.

240
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,222
That was the deal.

241
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,623
Agreed.

242
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:48,325
Thanks for getting this far, at least.

243
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:50,160
I have to admit,

244
00:15:50,228 --> 00:15:55,065
I never saw us
doing anything together. Ever.

245
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,434
These are strange times.

246
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,298
I thought we decided
we were going to part ways.

247
00:16:44,512 --> 00:16:45,879
Ugh, ah!

248
00:16:57,054 --> 00:16:58,054
Ah!

249
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,403
How am I supposed to find a clue

250
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,505
when I don't even know
what I'm looking for?

251
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,711
Uh!

252
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,854
Ventress!

253
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:46,956
I see you've had a change of heart.

254
00:18:01,168 --> 00:18:02,901
Why bring me here?

255
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:04,336
Answer me, Ventress.

256
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:05,403
Why?

257
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:51,804
Ah!

258
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:11,219
Calling all units.

259
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:14,255
Suspicious activity on level 1315.

260
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,108
Ugh.

261
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,801
Nano-droids?

262
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:14,943
No, Wolffe, let me explain.

263
00:20:30,224 --> 00:20:31,958
Explosives.

264
00:20:32,026 --> 00:20:33,860
These are the same types
of nano-droids

265
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:36,829
that were used to blow up
the Jedi Temple.

266
00:20:36,897 --> 00:20:38,698
I can't believe it.

267
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:48,573
<i>Captured she has been?</i>

268
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,541
Yes, Master Yoda.

269
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:52,143
<i>Without incident?</i>

270
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:54,846
No, she was subdued by the clones

271
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:59,083
and found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

272
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,086
It still doesn't explain
Ventress's involvement.

273
00:21:02,154 --> 00:21:04,355
We saw her with Ahsoka.

274
00:21:04,423 --> 00:21:06,758
<i>I think there's more going on
than we know.</i>

275
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:09,994
By Ahsoka or against her?

276
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,262
<i>That remains to be seen.</i>

277
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,997
<i>We're bringing her back to the temple.</i>

278
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,833
<i>Let's just hope we can keep her here.</i>

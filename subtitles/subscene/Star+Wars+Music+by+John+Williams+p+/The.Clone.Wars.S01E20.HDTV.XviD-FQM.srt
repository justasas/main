2
00:00:16,635 --> 00:00:17,558
<i>Invasion!</i>

3
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:21,788
<i>Separatist leader Wat Tambor
has taken control of the planet Ryloth</i>

4
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:25,674
<i>and subjugates its people
through a brutal droid occupation.</i>

5
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:29,445
<i>In a daring surprise attack,
Jedi Anakin Skywalker</i>

6
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,072
<i>and his padawan, Ahsoka Tano,</i>

7
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,158
<i>defeated the space blockade
guarding the planet.</i>

8
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,401
<i>Now Jedi Generals Mace Windu
and Obi-Wan Kenobi</i>

9
00:00:38,124 --> 00:00:41,315
<i>lead a massive invasion
to liberate the starving people.</i>

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,249
First trick will be getting our troops
on the ground.

11
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,963
If you take the city of Nabat first,
we'll have our landing zone.

12
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,800
Well, it's time to meet the natives.

13
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:11,529
<i>You must not allow the clones
to reach the surface.</i>

14
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:14,689
Our new proton cannon
are in the optimum position

15
00:01:14,814 --> 00:01:16,200
to prevent that, sir.

16
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:17,751
<i>What?</i>

17
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:21,205
<i>What if they focus the attack
on your cannon?</i>

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,918
I am utilizing the prisoners
from this village as living shields.

19
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:30,514
I calculate the Jedi will not risk
the prisoners' safety

20
00:01:30,695 --> 00:01:32,133
with a direct assault.

21
00:01:39,503 --> 00:01:41,183
We need to remember why we're here.

22
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,526
We came to aid the Twi-leks,
not destroy their home.

23
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,068
Cody?

24
00:01:46,425 --> 00:01:48,568
That means we'll be taking it back
the hard way.

25
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:51,690
Minimal destruction with blasters
and droid poppers only.

26
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,946
No rockets or detonators.
Check your aim.

27
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,129
Keep an eye out for the locals.
Am I understood?

28
00:01:57,254 --> 00:01:58,325
Sir, yes, sir!

29
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,281
If we're her
to free the tail-heads,

30
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:03,497
the list they can do is
get out of our way.

31
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,228
Sir, the enemy is in range.

32
00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,169
Fire at will.

33
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,791
General, the enemy fire
is penetrating our shields.

34
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:32,443
Get me Kenobi.

35
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,294
<i>We can't risk landing
the larger transports</i>

36
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:38,783
- <i>until you take out those guns.</i>
- Pull back. We'll take care of it.

37
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:46,693
Commander, the Republic transports
have turned away,

38
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:49,068
but the gunships
are still heading toward us.

39
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:51,128
Just as I calculated.

40
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,361
I think I see movement in the trees.
Fire, fire!

41
00:03:43,521 --> 00:03:45,506
That bunker is gonna be
a problem, General.

42
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:48,352
Leave the bunker to me.
Bring in your troopers on my signal!

43
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,132
Let's take them out!

44
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,292
Ghost company. Let's move!

45
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,885
Sir, I've lost contact
with our outer defenses.

46
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:24,697
The Republic troops
have overrun the village perimeter.

47
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,570
Find out
how the Jedi plan to attack.

48
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,252
Roger, roger.

49
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:34,273
The wall is secure, sir.
Are we moving on to the guns?

50
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,448
We need to know
what the droids have in store for us.

51
00:04:37,573 --> 00:04:39,273
Send your best men to scout ahead.

52
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,971
Will do, sir.

53
00:04:41,528 --> 00:04:43,328
Boil, Waxer, come with me.

54
00:04:43,837 --> 00:04:45,451
I guess we're the best.

55
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,522
Buildings are just buildings.

56
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,427
What really makes a city
are the inhabitants that live in it.

57
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,679
So where are they?

58
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,950
We'll check out the courtyard.
You two, take the south sector.

59
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,164
Be back at command by 0620.

60
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:14,449
Yes, sir.

61
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,782
I tell you, Boil, this is creepy.

62
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:22,324
You think they've killed
all of them?

63
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:24,369
Well, there are no bodies.

64
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,420
They were driven from their homes.
I don't think they had a...

65
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:30,261
Had a what?

66
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:33,635
Choice.

67
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:50,260
Not going to be easy
getting to those guns, sir.

68
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:52,309
There is always a way, Wooley.

69
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:01,197
Wait, Twi'leks.

70
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:04,697
They're holding
all the survivors hostage.

71
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,922
We have to report this
to General Kenobi.

72
00:06:24,746 --> 00:06:28,174
They're in the courtyard here and here.
But there's a complication.

73
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:31,389
They've taken the locals hostage
and they're using them as shields.

74
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:35,013
The Twi'lek prisoners will make this
difficult but not impossible.

75
00:06:35,138 --> 00:06:38,313
I still have a good plan
for taking out those guns.

76
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,734
<i>Getting the villagers out of harm's way
is our first priority.</i>

77
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,569
<i>I have faith in you, General Kenobi.</i>

78
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:46,076
Cody, we'll go in
with everything we have.

79
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:47,448
Clear those hostages.

80
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,911
So it's General Kenobi
who is leading this assault.

81
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:56,065
He is known
for his deceptive maneuvers.

82
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,459
Roger, roger. Download his file.

83
00:07:12,487 --> 00:07:15,328
- It's just a little girl.
- What are we going to do with her?

84
00:07:16,213 --> 00:07:17,978
Why do we have to do anything?

85
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,231
- We've got a mission to finish.
- We should do something.

86
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,768
- I say we take her with us.
- You can't be serious.

87
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,527
She'll only slow us down.

88
00:07:26,327 --> 00:07:29,281
- Look, she's afraid of us.
- Not us. Quick, hide!

89
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,495
That was a recon unit.
We'd better get moving.

90
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,080
We can't leave her here.

91
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,123
Fine, we'll take her.

92
00:07:39,602 --> 00:07:40,766
Be careful.

93
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:43,462
Don't worry, Waxer.
I don't think she's armed.

94
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,167
Little tail-head bit me.

95
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,218
Stop, you're scaring her.

96
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,229
She probably thinks we're droids.

97
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:59,619
It's all right.
See, I'm flesh and blood,

98
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,330
just like you.

99
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,105
She looks half starved.

100
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:04,954
Here.

101
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:25,159
No, I'm Waxer.

102
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,111
He's Boil.

103
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,269
You made a friend.
Mission accomplished.

104
00:08:32,677 --> 00:08:33,720
Can we go now?

105
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,230
Come on, kid.

106
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,950
Come on.

107
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,703
Look, she doesn't even want to go.

108
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:45,328
Little monster was fine
before we came along, so let's move.

109
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,032
Sergeant, are the creatures ready?

110
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:16,232
I starved them,
like you ordered, sir.

111
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,558
I wonder what happened
to her family.

112
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,489
They're probably dead.
Hopefully, she'll survive this mess.

113
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:41,061
So what happens to her?
I mean, after we leave.

114
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,481
I don't know.

115
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:45,918
Don't get any ideas.
We're not taking her with us.

116
00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:50,568
She's gone.

117
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,957
I'm sure the little biter
will turn up.

118
00:09:57,793 --> 00:09:58,993
There you are.

119
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,032
How'd she get in front of us?

120
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:10,707
No, don't go that way!
That's where the recon droid went.

121
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,209
Waxer, let her go.

122
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,134
I'm not just going
to let the droids get her.

123
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:17,577
I'm just trying to keep you alive!

124
00:10:18,797 --> 00:10:20,410
I'll be darned if I know why.

125
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:29,378
Where's she going?

126
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:39,135
Wait! Hold on, there!

127
00:10:44,231 --> 00:10:45,589
There you are.

128
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:47,873
Good, you caught her.

129
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:50,131
You know,
I have binders if we need 'em.

130
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:51,191
What?

131
00:10:57,303 --> 00:10:59,353
What are we doing here, anyway?

132
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:27,589
I guess this was her home.

133
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,689
Poor little thing. She lost it all.

134
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:53,837
It's okay now.
We're here to help.

135
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:12,122
Don't cry, kid.
We'll keep you safe.

136
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,151
I promise.

137
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:24,066
The men set, Cody?
What is it?

138
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,212
Waxer and Boil are not responding.

139
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:29,649
- They never returned from scouting.
- That isn't like them.

140
00:12:29,774 --> 00:12:31,589
They may have run into trouble.

141
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,959
Sergeant,
use the high-powered transmitter,

142
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,524
- see if you can reach Waxer and Boil.
- Yes, sir!

143
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,349
Let's get the rest of the men moving.
The others will catch up.

144
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,510
They are on the move.

145
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,962
Sergeant, the attack is coming.

146
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,165
Release the beasts.

147
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
It is time to execute my plan.

148
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,301
Roger, roger.

149
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,525
It's the commander.
We're way overdue, Waxer.

150
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:06,252
We're going to end up
polishing R2 units.

151
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,861
Wait. How are we going
to explain all this, her?

152
00:13:10,947 --> 00:13:12,082
You're asking me?

153
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,090
Maybe if we hurry back, we can tell them
we ran into a little trouble.

154
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:16,464
Oh, that's for sure.

155
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:18,797
And our transmissions
were jammed by the droids.

156
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:22,069
It's worth a try.
But mark my words,

157
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,385
this will end badly.

158
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,755
I think I know
why the kid never came back here.

159
00:13:45,967 --> 00:13:48,733
You see what happens
when we don't follow orders?

160
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,458
Let's get out of here!

161
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,902
These suckers won't give up!

162
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,545
You grab the gun
and I'll hold 'em back.

163
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:44,879
- Aim for their eyes!
- Look out, look out!

164
00:14:45,004 --> 00:14:46,004
Fall back!

165
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:50,388
The Republic ground troops
have been routed, Emir.

166
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:52,504
<i>What was that?</i>

167
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:55,068
I calculate the remaing clones

168
00:14:55,193 --> 00:14:57,843
are attempting
a desperate final offensive.

169
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:00,742
Their chances of success against us

170
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,627
are 742:1.

171
00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:05,667
<i>You had better be right.</i>

172
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,318
I am a droid.

173
00:15:08,014 --> 00:15:09,414
I am always right.

174
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,226
No, wait.

175
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:59,474
- Incredible.
- Quiet, rookie.

176
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:01,434
Shoot the bridge!

177
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,042
Don't shoot.

178
00:16:34,175 --> 00:16:36,761
Waxer, Boil.
Where have you two slackers been?

179
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,134
Sir, there is an explanation.

180
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:40,709
We got sidetracked.

181
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,478
I think I see what sidetracked you.

182
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,072
The clones have defeated
the creatures.

183
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:50,748
Yes, but their numbers are thin.

184
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,153
Prepare for their final attack.

185
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:56,634
Hello, little one.

186
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:58,944
She brought us here
through the tunnels.

187
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,681
Knows her way around them
pretty good, sir.

188
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,558
The girl can lead us
through the tunnel to the prisoners.

189
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:13,973
Cody,
we're going to need a diversion.

190
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:34,831
Yup, this is about the worst job
in the droid army.

191
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,061
What?

192
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:41,608
What?

193
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,538
I'll take care of this.
You keep her here.

194
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,826
There they are. Let's go!

195
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,808
Pull back! Pull back!

196
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,390
Commander, we have a problem.

197
00:18:54,662 --> 00:18:56,862
The Jedi is freeing the prisoners.

198
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,023
Numa!

199
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,566
Waxer, Boil, come with me.

200
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:21,775
We're with you, sir.

201
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,087
Ready, General.

202
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,017
Setting Alpha five or six!

203
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,386
Where's the override?

204
00:20:28,454 --> 00:20:30,589
You lose, General Kenobi.

205
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:36,393
Does not compute.
Does not compute.

206
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:39,122
Does not compute.
Does not compute...

207
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:03,330
Great job getting rid
of those cannons.

208
00:21:03,455 --> 00:21:05,675
Now we have
a more difficult objective.

209
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,600
We must take the capital
and free this world.

210
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,120
See ya later, little one.

211
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:18,255
Hey, numa.

212
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:20,769
Stay out of trouble.

213
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:25,892
Don't be afraid. We'll be back.

214
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,876
Sir, what is that
she keeps calling us?

215
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,099
<i>Nerra.</i> It means "brother."

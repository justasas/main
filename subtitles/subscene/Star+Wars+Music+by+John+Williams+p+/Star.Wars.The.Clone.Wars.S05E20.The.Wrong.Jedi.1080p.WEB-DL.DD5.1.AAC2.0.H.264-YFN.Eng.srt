Male announcer:
Ahsoka tano captured!

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,486
While on the run
to prove her innocence,

6
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:24,655
Padawan tano teamed up
with the deadly asajj ventress

7
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:29,127
To find the rogue jedi
who framed ahsoka for murder.

8
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,362
The jedi council
sent anakin skywalker

9
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,499
And master plo koon
to track ahsoka down

10
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,768
And bring her back
to the temple.

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,136
Now captured and imprisoned,

12
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:42,774
Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,810
- The senate requests
that ahsoka tano be indicted

14
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:49,047
For acts of treason
against the republic.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,050
- A fair trial
padawan tano will have

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,552
In accordance
with jedi tradition.

17
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,355
- Ah, yes, jedi tradition.

18
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,356
I'm afraid, master yoda,

19
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:02,593
That the senate believes
that an internal jedi trial

20
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,662
Would seem biased.

21
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:05,630
Therefore, the senate asks

22
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:09,600
That the council expel
ahsoka tano from the jedi order

23
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:12,603
So that she may be put
to a republic military tribunal,

24
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,706
Where she will receive
more impartial judgment.

25
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:20,778
- And who would represent ahsoka
in this tribunal, admiral?

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,381
- That would be up
to the council, general,

27
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:27,385
But I would recommend
someone outside the order.

28
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,252
- Of course.

29
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,423
- The council will act
as they deem necessary.

30
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,526
Thank you, admiral.

31
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:38,663
- Surely we cannot do
what tarkin suggests.

32
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,132
We need to stand together
with ahsoka.

33
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,367
- And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

34
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,137
The mastermind behind the attack
on the temple.

35
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:51,142
- She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

36
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,411
This alone is enough
to convict her.

37
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,147
- I understand your sentiment,
obi-wan,

38
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,683
But if the council does
as you suggest,

39
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:01,285
It could be seen
as an act of opposition

40
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,386
To the senate.

41
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:06,524
I'm afraid
we have little choice.

42
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,825
- Hmm.

43
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:09,393
To the chamber of judgment,

44
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,696
Summon skywalker
and his padawan,

45
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:16,467
And in our decision,
may the force guide us.

I'm sorry, snips.

I just--I just don't know
what to do.

52
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,390
- It's okay.

53
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,625
I don't either.

56
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:20,531
- Padawan tano,

57
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,569
Serious charges
have been levied against you.

58
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,304
How plead you?

59
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,405
- Not guilty, master.

60
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,308
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,344
The values of the jedi
are sacred to me.

62
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,313
- There is evidence
to the contrary.

63
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:38,349
You were alone with
letta turmond when she died.

64
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,717
Can you explain this?

65
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,720
- Someone used the force
against her.

66
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,288
- Which brings us to ventress.

67
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,891
Can you explain your association
with her?

68
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,860
- We had a mutual understanding.

69
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,828
I thought she was helping me.

70
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,397
- Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

71
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,332
Found when you were apprehended,

72
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,834
The same devices used
in the bombing of the temple?

73
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,671
- No, I was set up
and deceived,

74
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,673
As you are being deceived now.

75
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,343
- The question is,
padawan tano,

76
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,978
Who is deceiving us?

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,714
Ventress, you, or someone else?

78
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:11,582
- I am not deceiving you.

79
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,951
I would assume ventress is,

80
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,620
But I can't be sure.

81
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:18,356
My sense is clouded.

82
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,857
- Clouded by the dark side

83
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,460
These things are,
padawan tano.

84
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,028
Dangerously clouded,

85
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,830
But not just surrounding you,

86
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,566
Surrounding many things
in these times.

87
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,669
- You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

88
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,673
This meeting
is just a formality!

89
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:36,340
- [sighs]

90
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,442
Reached a decision, we have,

91
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,512
Though not in total agreement
are we.

92
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,414
- It is the council's opinion

93
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:46,284
That padawan ahsoka tano
has committed sedition

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:46,917
Against the republic,

95
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,324
And thus, she will be expelled
from the jedi order.

96
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:53,958
- You can't do this!

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,028
- Your padawan status
will be stripped from you,

98
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,697
And you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

99
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,366
Within the grand army
of the republic.

100
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,935
You will be turned over
to the republic courts

101
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,870
To await your trail

102
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,773
And whatever punishment
they will set for you.

103
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:14,645
Henceforth, you are barred
from the jedi order.

104

[door whooshes]

105
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,028
- Padmé has agreed to represent
you before the senate.

106
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,665
- I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, ahsoka.

107
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,902
- I am almost certain
that the person behind this

108
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,569
Is ventress,

109
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:41,405
And you know
I wasn't working with her.

110
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,407
She was at the warehouse...

111
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:43,908
In the room.

112
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,410
We fought,
but she got away.

113
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:50,548
Didn't any of the clones
see anything?

114
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,884
- No, none of the clones
reported seeing ventress

115
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:54,985
At the scene.

116
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,420
I thought you said
ventress left

117
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,389
Before you went
into the warehouse.

118
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,557
- That's what I thought, too,

119
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,992
But then she attacked me
when I got inside.

120
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,061
I'd know
her red lightsabers anywhere.

121
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:08,699
- Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

122
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,868
- Wait, where are you going?

123
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,570
You can't leave now.

124
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,804
- Yes, I can.

125
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:18,676
I have to find ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

126
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,811
- Until we hear from anakin,

127
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,913
Let's work on your defense.

128
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:23,614
- [sighs]

129
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,850
Forgive me
if I'm not optimistic.

130
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,052
I thought
I was part of that order,

131
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:32,022
But everyone, except anakin,
has abandoned me.

132
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,090
I'm not holding out much hope

133
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,060

When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

149

I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

- Bounty?

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,875

to catch your pet

152
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,478
And turn her over
to the authorities,

153
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,582
Collect whatever bounty
was due.

And a little bit
of revenge,

158

But then I realized
your fallen padawan and I

Had a lot in common.

My master abandoned me,

You have been charged

Against the jedi order
and the republic itself.

This court

Behind the attack
on the jedi temple

177

And that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

178

You eliminated them

185

After I left
your little padawan alone,

186
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,122
I was walking away,

187
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,093
And I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

188
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:29,793
But I was wrong.

189
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,197
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

190
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,834
Not just anyone
can sneak up behind me.

191
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,203
It had to be another jedi.

192
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,804
- I don't believe you.

193
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,271

Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,780
Well, this leads me
to a dead end.

198

You're the only one
ahsoka had talked to.

199
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,153

00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,721
- What do you mean?

201
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,157
- Your padawan
contacted the temple.

202
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,794
She spoke to someone
named barriss.

203
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,163
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

204
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,997
In the first place.

205
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,168
It was this barriss
that told us to go there.

- If you're lying,
you're dead.

207
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,141
- Such promises.

208
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,378
- Look at the facts.

209
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,181
Letta turmond called ahsoka
to her cell

210
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,316
To reveal the name
of the true mastermind

211
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,352
Behind the bombing
of the jedi temple.

212
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,754
Letta told ahsoka
she was afraid.

213
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,390
She told her
the mastermind was a jedi,

214
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,193
And before she could reveal
the jedi's name,

215
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,929
Letta turmond
was strangled to death

216
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,264
By way of the force.

217
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,700
Why would ahsoka kill letta

218
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,002
With a method
that would so obviously

219
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,336
Tie the murder to her?

220
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,807
A jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

221
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,243
But that jedi
is not ahsoka tano.

222
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,411
Members of the court,

223
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,848
You are prosecuting
the wrong jedi.

Well said, senator amidala.

226

However, if she is innocent,

227
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,093
Then why was she seen conspiring
with known separatist terrorist

228
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,328
Asajj ventress?

229
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,930
- Ventress set me up.

230
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,865
My master will prove that.

231
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,800
- And where is your master?

232
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,737
- He's trying to find
the real murderer.

233
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:24,908
- Then maybe
he should be looking at you.

I need to talk to you.

240
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,940
How can I help you?

241
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,376
- I was told
that you spoke with ahsoka

242
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:00,844
Before she was arrested.

243
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,246
What did you say to her?

244
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,815
- We've been friends
for a long time.

245
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,517
I was only trying to help her.

246
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,485
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

247
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:09,553
- It's no trouble.

248
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,322
I just need to know
what you told her

249
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,490
And if you told anyone else.

250
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,360
- No, I thought
I had a clue for her,

251
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,529
But I really couldn't
tell her anything.

252
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,998
Who told you
I spoke to her?

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,499
- Ventress.

254
00:13:22,501 --> 00:13:24,168
She told me.

255
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,802
- Ventress?

256
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,305
Isn't she the one ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

257
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,174
- That's what ahsoka says,

258
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,009
But I think she's wrong.

259
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,945
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

260
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,446
- And you believe her?

261
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,249
Who else could it be
if not her?

262
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,050
Surely not ahsoka.

263
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:44,121
- No, I don't think
it was ahsoka either.

264
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:48,058
I think both ahsoka and ventress
are telling the truth,

265
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,229
But there's only one way
to find out.

266

Funny.
Those belong to ventress.

look at this former jedi

And think, "surely
she cannot be this murderer

"is this yet another
separatist scheme?"

364
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:24,387
- Ahsoka, wait!

365
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:28,225
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

366
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:32,495
[sighs]

367
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:35,298
Why are you doing this?

368
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,534
- The council didn't trust me,

369
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,237
So how can I trust myself?

370
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,438
- What about me?

371
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,907
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

372
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,277
- I know you believe in me,
anakin,

373
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,479
And I'm grateful for that.

374
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,548
But this isn't about you.

375
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:55,318
I can't stay here
any longer,

376
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,686
Not now.

377
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:58,688
- The jedi order
is your life.

378
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,491
You can't just throw it away
like this.

379
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,327
Ahsoka,
you are making a mistake.

380
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:09,032
- Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

381
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,801
Without the council

382
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:14,304
And without you.

383
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,440
- I understand.

384
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,875
More than you realize,

385
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:24,848
I understand wanting
to walk away from the order.

386
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:28,585
- I know.

387
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:36,893

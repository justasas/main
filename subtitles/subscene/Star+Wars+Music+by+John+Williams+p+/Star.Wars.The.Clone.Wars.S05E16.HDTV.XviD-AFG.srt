2
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:21,578
Neutral start systems in peril.

3
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:25,348
Darth Maul and Savage Opress
command the planet Mandalore

4
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,551
through the puppet Prime Minister Almec

5
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,553
while they expand
their criminal enterprise.

6
00:00:30,621 --> 00:00:32,989
With the Death Watch removed from power

7
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,458
and the Jedi unaware
of the villainous plot,

8
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:38,194
nothing stands in the way
of Darth Maul's vision

9
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:40,529
for a vast criminal empire.

10
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,999
We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned

11
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,000
as her few remaining loyal subjects

12
00:00:45,068 --> 00:00:48,037
make a desperate attempt to rescue her.

13
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,738
What do you want, you traitor?

14
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,909
I would never betray you, Auntie Satine.

15
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:55,077
I'm here to rescue you.

16
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:56,845
Korkie.

17
00:00:58,348 --> 00:00:59,581
Freeze!

18
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:01,683
Hold it there.

19
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,354
Death Watch.

20
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:10,159
Bo.

21
00:01:10,226 --> 00:01:12,294
It's been a long time.

22
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:13,428
It's okay, Auntie.

23
00:01:13,496 --> 00:01:15,230
She's on our side now.

24
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:17,532
Why are you helping now?

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,470
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

26
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:24,273
There was a time
when we weren't enemies.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,743
Perhaps that time has come again.

28
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,045
Come on.

29
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,213
Let's go.

30
00:01:36,453 --> 00:01:39,055
It's all clear.
Come on.

31
00:01:42,026 --> 00:01:44,861
We need to contact the Jedi Council.

32
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:46,663
Korkie, give me your comlink.

33
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,932
It won't be any good
unless we get outside the city.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,701
All of the frequencies are jammed.

35
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:53,970
You are all taking
a terrible risk by helping me.

36
00:01:54,038 --> 00:01:55,739
Nothing we haven't done before.

37
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:56,907
Right, Auntie?

38
00:01:56,975 --> 00:01:58,642
Let's get going.

39
00:02:32,412 --> 00:02:33,413
Take 'em out.

40
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:43,390
Get the duchess clear.

41
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,332
The transmission is still blocked.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,310
You're clear.

43
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,680
This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.

44
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,148
I've lost Mandalore.

45
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,450
My people have been massacred.

46
00:03:40,622 --> 00:03:43,757
Obi-Wan, I need your help.

47
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,502
You summoned me, Masters?

48
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,742
This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.

49
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,277
I've lost Mandalore.

50
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,878
My people have been massacred,

51
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:07,581
and Almec is now the prime minister.

52
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:09,149
I can't explain everything now

53
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:13,119
but Almec has the support
of the crime families.

54
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:16,455
Obi-Wan, I need your help.

55
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:22,195
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi.

56
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,965
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years.

57
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:29,202
And according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

58
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,872
they're no longer in league
with the Separatists.

59
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,707
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

60
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,709
it was most likely an independent act

61
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:38,145
caused by the Death Watch alone.

62
00:04:38,213 --> 00:04:40,547
Without involvement
from the Separatists,

63
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,651
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

64
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:45,486
I'm afraid we cannot help.

65
00:04:45,554 --> 00:04:48,456
We cannot just hand Mandalore
over to these crime families

66
00:04:48,524 --> 00:04:50,125
and let Satine become a martyr.

67
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:52,761
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

68
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:55,563
makes this situation difficult.

69
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:58,733
Understand your feelings I do,
Obi-Wan.

70
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,235
But to take action,

71
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:03,672
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

72
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,107
You know what the Senate will decide.

73
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,244
They will not send aid
to a neutral system.

74
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:13,615
At this time, nothing more can we do.

75
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:19,888
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

76
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,557
including the renegade
Death Watch soldiers.

77
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,192
But we will find them.

78
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,595
The duchess appears
to have contacted the Jedi

79
00:05:26,662 --> 00:05:28,029
just as anticipated.

80
00:05:28,097 --> 00:05:29,398
Good.

81
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,500
You have done well.

82
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:33,535
What of the people?

83
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:36,071
You are the legitimate prime minister.

84
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,740
Mandalore is a sovereign planet

85
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:41,043
and you will maintain its neutrality.

86
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,411
And what of the Jedi?

87
00:05:44,214 --> 00:05:46,615
Because of Mandalore's neutrality,

88
00:05:46,682 --> 00:05:49,217
the Jedi have no jurisdiction here.

89
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:53,888
If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend,

90
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:57,325
he will have to come alone.

91
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,153
Ah.

92
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:27,621
Ah!

93
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:31,058
Anakin, that's the last time
I borrow a ship from you.

94
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:44,505
You better get your ship looked at.

95
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,573
Oh, it's my friend's ship.

96
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,023
He told me it was perfectly fine.

97
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,412
Terribly sorry about that.

98
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,413
Do you have a landing permit?

99
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:57,083
Um, I think I left it in the ship.

100
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,085
Come with me, and I'll get it.

101
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:53,350
Here to do more
of your master's bidding?

102
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,020
I do my own bidding.

103
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:57,654
Obi-Wan.

104
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,427
Are you alone?

105
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:04,495
Yes.

106
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:06,003
The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate

107
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,265
will be of no help to us here.

108
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:15,205
I trust you have an escape plan then?

109
00:08:15,273 --> 00:08:17,007
As always, my dear.

110
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:28,318
There's no record
of a prisoner transfer here.

111
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,620
The orders came from upstairs.

112
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,226
What's the authorization code?

113
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:38,128
Oh, um...

114
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:46,336
Hey, you!

115
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,403
Stop!

116
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:50,440
It's the duchess.

117
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:51,908
She's getting away.

118
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,947
We have to contact my sister for help.

119
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:32,649
She'll send reinforcements.

120
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:34,184
Who's your sister?

121
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:49,134
Brace yourself!

122
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,477
Let's get out of here.

123
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:02,182
Obi-Wan!

124
00:10:29,077 --> 00:10:31,312
No.
It can't be.

125
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:41,423
We meet again, Kenobi.

126
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,492
Welcome to my world.

127
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,497
Take them back to the palace.

128
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:07,050
Your noble flaw is a weakness
shared by you...

129
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:08,952
and your duchess.

130
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,022
You should have chosen the dark side,

131
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,556
Master Jedi.

132
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:18,628
Your emotions betray you.

133
00:11:18,696 --> 00:11:20,663
Your fear,

134
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:23,866
and yes, your anger.

135
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:28,003
Let your anger deepen your hatred.

136
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:29,905
Don't listen to him, Obi--

137
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:31,440
- Quiet.

138
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:35,577
You can kill me,
but you will never destroy me.

139
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:38,080
It takes strength
to resist the dark side.

140
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,181
Only the weak embrace it.

141
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:42,350
It is more powerful than you know.

142
00:11:42,418 --> 00:11:44,552
And those who oppose it
are more powerful

143
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,787
than you'll ever be.

144
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:48,490
I know where you're from.

145
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:50,392
I've been to your village.

146
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,029
I know the decision to join
the dark side wasn't yours.

147
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:55,731
The Nightsisters made it for you.

148
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,732
Silence!

149
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,001
You think you know me?

150
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:01,603
It was I who languished for years

151
00:12:01,671 --> 00:12:03,639
thinking of nothing but you.

152
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:05,574
Nothing but this moment.

153
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:11,114
And now the perfect tool
for my vengeance

154
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,149
is in front of us.

155
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:15,285
I never planned on killing you.

156
00:12:15,352 --> 00:12:19,689
But I will make you share
my pain, Kenobi.

157
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:33,569
Satine.

158
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:48,418
Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...

159
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:54,457
I've loved you always.

160
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,494
I always will.

161
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,741
Do we kill him now, brother?

162
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,410
No.

163
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:15,811
Imprison him below.

164
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,615
Let him drown in his misery.

165
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:22,251
Take him to his cell to rot.

166
00:13:43,372 --> 00:13:45,874
You summoned me, Chancellor?

167
00:13:45,942 --> 00:13:48,076
Prepare my ship.

168
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,736
- Ah!
- It's the rebels!

169
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:37,559
Sorry, I don't believe we've met.

170
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,560
You are?

171
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,728
Bo-Katan.

172
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:40,896
I'm here to rescue you.

173
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,431
That's all you need to know.

174
00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,533
Sounds good to me.

175
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,802
You ever use one of these before?

176
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,139
No, but in this case,
I'm a fast learner.

177
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,206
Let's go.

178
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:38,316
Halt!

179
00:16:40,948 --> 00:16:43,216
Maul must really want you dead.

180
00:16:43,284 --> 00:16:45,519
You have no idea.

181
00:16:51,126 --> 00:16:54,162
Hmm, I sense a presence.

182
00:16:54,229 --> 00:16:57,331
A presence
I haven't felt since--

183
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,200
Master.

184
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:14,782
Master.

185
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:21,088
I am most impressed to see
you have survived your injuries.

186
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:23,557
I used your training, Master.

187
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,859
And I have built all this

188
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:29,129
in hopes of returning to your side.

189
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:30,864
Hmm.

190
00:17:30,932 --> 00:17:32,933
How unfortunate

191
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,937
that are attempting to deceive me.

192
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:38,739
Master?

193
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,912
You have become a rival!

194
00:18:44,677 --> 00:18:47,212
Go back to your Republic
and tell them what has happened.

195
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,414
That would likely lead
to a Republic invasion

196
00:18:49,482 --> 00:18:50,415
of Mandalore.

197
00:18:50,483 --> 00:18:52,351
Yes, and Maul will die.

198
00:18:52,418 --> 00:18:54,386
But Mandalore will survive.

199
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,621
We always survive.

200
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:59,391
Now go.

201
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,793
Your Satine's sister, aren't you?

202
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,998
I'm so sorry.

203
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,718
Oof.

204
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:44,102
Ugh!

205
00:19:46,472 --> 00:19:47,472
Uh!

206
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,097
Brother.

207
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,882
Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice.

208
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,919
I'm not like you.

209
00:20:33,986 --> 00:20:36,655
I never was.

210
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:43,795
Remember, the first
and only reality of the Sith:

211
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:46,264
there can only be two.

212
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:51,103
And you are no longer my apprentice.

213
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:55,374
You have been replaced.

214
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:30,745
Ugh!

215
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,452
Have mercy.

216
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,887
Please.

217
00:21:38,955 --> 00:21:40,055
Please!

218
00:21:40,122 --> 00:21:41,790
There is no mercy.

219
00:21:46,195 --> 00:21:48,163
Do not worry.

220
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,832
I'm not going to kill you.

221
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,469
I have other uses for you.

222
00:22:03,413 --> 00:22:13,597

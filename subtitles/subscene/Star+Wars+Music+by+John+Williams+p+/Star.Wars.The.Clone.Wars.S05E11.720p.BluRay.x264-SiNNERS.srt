1
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:19,887
<i>Secret weapons!</i>

2
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:22,491
<i>The Jedi Council deploys
a squad of droids</i>

3
00:00:22,525 --> 00:00:25,595
<i>on a desperate mission
aboard a Separatist cruiser.</i>

4
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,898
<i>Under the guidance
of Colonel Meebur Gascon,</i>

5
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:32,036
<i>the droids succeed in stealing
a crucial encryption module.</i>

6
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,306
<i>Now the colonel and his droid squad</i>

7
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:37,010
<i>must return the module
to the Jedi Temple</i>

8
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:38,746
<i>to crack a Separatist code</i>

9
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:42,718
<i>detailing an impending terror
plot against the Republic.</i>

10
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:49,025
How long until my command
center is operational again?

11
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:53,932
Okay, fine.

12
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:58,572
I meant how long until Beezee
is operational again?

13
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,710
Well, make it fast.

14
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:04,747
We must get this encryption
module back to the Republic

15
00:01:04,782 --> 00:01:06,583
as soon as possible.

16
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,302
Uh-oh.

17
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:31,050
Oh, Beezee, you are all better.

18
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,621
WAC, what are you doing back here?

19
00:01:34,656 --> 00:01:37,258
Who is flying this shuttle?

20
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,628
I have good news and bad news, Colonel.

21
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:42,699
The bad news is, scans are
picking up giant ice formations,

22
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:45,602
commonly called comets,
heading straight for us.

23
00:01:45,636 --> 00:01:46,703
What? Wha...

24
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,175
What in the world is the good news?

25
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,777
At least you have a good excuse

26
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,914
if your mission is a failure.

27
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,785
Get out of my...

28
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:10,636
Quick, drop us out of hyperspace.

29
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,549
Whoa!

30
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:24,756
Look out!

31
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Whoa!

32
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:39,410
The shuttle's power system
has been knocked out.

33
00:02:39,444 --> 00:02:41,346
I can see that.

34
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:46,552
He says he can fix it.

35
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:10,585
And swinging right.

36
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,437
Auxiliary power has been restored,

37
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,239
but it is not enough to get us moving.

38
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:29,176
We need the primary motivators
reestablished now.

39
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,211
Forget that.

40
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,680
We need the engines to come on.

41
00:03:31,714 --> 00:03:33,783
That's what I'm saying.

42
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,567
Uh-oh.
They just got bigger.

43
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,573
Come on, you lousy mechs.

44
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,083
Uh, Colonel,
we are headed for that comet.

45
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,618
Brace yourself!

46
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:06,795
The engines are back online!

47
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,841
Ah!

48
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,807
Whoa! Whoa!

49
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,544
Whoa!

50
00:05:09,013 --> 00:05:10,848
We have lost the stabilizers

51
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,817
and primary control of the engines.

52
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,990
We are going to have
to put her down on that planet.

53
00:05:19,795 --> 00:05:20,895
What planet is it?

54
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,398
Is it Separatist-controlled?

55
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,432
Who cares?

56
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,500
I care.

57
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,603
We can't jeopardize the mission.

58
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:29,074
I think we are past that point, sir.

59
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:56,011
We're going down!

60
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:12,367
Ugh. Oh.

61
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:15,405
I think I ruptured my gizzard.

62
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:47,784
Well, this is a fine mess
you mechs got us into.

63
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,723
Look at this.

64
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:53,325
All the database says is,

65
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,865
"Abafar. Information
void."

66
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,003
Don't be absurd.

67
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:03,273
We can't just go rushing off like fools

68
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,975
into this... this void.

69
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,479
We need to stay put,
consider all the facts,

70
00:07:07,513 --> 00:07:10,416
and then I'll, uh... I'll draw up
a reconnaissance plan,

71
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,386
and we can...
hey, hey!

72
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,355
Where are you going, soldier?

73
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:19,829
He says we have to finish our mission.

74
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,668
Hey!
Where did you get that?

75
00:07:24,704 --> 00:07:27,940
That is classified material.

76
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:33,048
I will not stand for insubordination.

77
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:34,349
Do not worry, Colonel.

78
00:07:34,383 --> 00:07:36,118
I can lead the mission from here

79
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,720
and return the module.

80
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,957
Maybe they'll give <i>me</i> a promotion.

81
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:43,394
Over my dead body.

82
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:45,430
Beezee, pop your top.

83
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:50,004
I will not let you droids
commandeer my mission.

84
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:21,979
Ugh, so hot.

85
00:08:24,684 --> 00:08:27,353
Ugh, I can't believe I came this close

86
00:08:27,388 --> 00:08:29,523
to completing my first mission

87
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,429
only to get lost
in this detestable desert.

88
00:08:33,463 --> 00:08:35,197
Look on the bright side, Colonel.

89
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,367
At least it is a sunny day.

90
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,371
What sun?
I don't see any sun.

91
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:43,777
It's just hot and oppressive.

92
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:45,945
Wait a minute.

93
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,581
There's no sun.

94
00:08:47,616 --> 00:08:49,885
How do we know
which direction we're going?

95
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:55,326
You set your directional
guidance to "straight"?

96
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,961
That's all we're going on,

97
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,798
some rudimentary programming directive

98
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,135
in a lousy astromech?

99
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,379
Yes, I know you're designed
for navigation,

100
00:09:09,413 --> 00:09:11,415
but that requires map coordinates

101
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,217
and environmental input...

102
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,287
something we are sorely lacking here.

103
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:19,493
All right, we can't rely on technology.

104
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,862
We have to rely on my training,

105
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:25,233
something you droids don't have.

106
00:09:25,268 --> 00:09:28,271
How do you know, Colonel?

107
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,674
Because droids don't get training.

108
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:31,875
You get programmed.

109
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,611
Clang!

110
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:36,014
That's your weakness.

111
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:40,420
So how is your training going
to lead us out of this void?

112
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:44,827
Well, uh, my, uh, training
as an officer tells me

113
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,964
to use all available resources
to, uh...

114
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:50,902
to stay alive until help comes.

115
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:53,038
So your officer training...

116
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:54,841
how exactly did you learn that?

117
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,445
It was drilled into me by my superiors.

118
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,813
Then you were programmed.

119
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:01,515
Just like us.

120
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,650
What?

121
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:05,488
No, I am not like you droids in any way.

122
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,559
I can think outside
my program...

123
00:10:08,593 --> 00:10:10,127
I mean, my training.

124
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:13,464
And I can make decisions based
on a complex analysis

125
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:14,933
of a situation,

126
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:18,704
which is why I insist we return
to the ship.

127
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:19,873
Wait a minute.

128
00:10:19,907 --> 00:10:21,909
Why can't I find our tracks?

129
00:10:21,977 --> 00:10:23,611
There are not any.

130
00:10:23,645 --> 00:10:25,013
What?

131
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:26,281
I noticed it earlier.

132
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,850
This surface leaves no trace of us.

133
00:10:28,885 --> 00:10:30,653
You noticed it earlier?

134
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:34,057
Why in the world
didn't you say anything?

135
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,327
I did not think we would want
to go backwards

136
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:39,631
when forwards seems to be
the only way out of this void.

137
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,902
Why are you thinking?

138
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:44,471
I don't want you to think.

139
00:10:44,506 --> 00:10:46,173
Thinking is my job.

140
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,176
I am the commanding officer.

141
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,479
You are just a pilot.

142
00:10:50,547 --> 00:10:53,083
Oh, that hurt.

143
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,487
Ugh.

144
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,356
I have been thinking, Colonel.

145
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,693
I told you not to do that.

146
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,597
My programming keeps me
focused on the task at hand,

147
00:11:03,632 --> 00:11:06,335
which means I do not have
to worry about my health.

148
00:11:06,369 --> 00:11:08,070
I just have to worry about the mission.

149
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,173
Don't even go there.

150
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,542
So I think...

151
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:13,277
Don't do that!

152
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:16,616
When you die,
I should lead D-Squad.

153
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,518
Stop!

154
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,225
You are what's killing me!

155
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:26,696
I can't believe I am forced
to justify my existence

156
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,265
with a droid!

157
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,201
Ugh! I'm at the end!

158
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,536
I can feel it!

159
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:36,343
All I ask is that you
just let me die with dignity!

160
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,913
Is that possible?

161
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:42,985
What?

162
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,955
Our ship?

163
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:52,098
You... you stupid lucky droids.

164
00:11:52,133 --> 00:11:56,137
You have just taken us in a circle.

165
00:12:06,153 --> 00:12:07,187
Wait a minute.

166
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,523
Is this really our ship?

167
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,995
How long have we been gone?

168
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,708
Ugh.

169
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,744
No, it is not our ship.

170
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,780
No, no, no!

171
00:12:26,814 --> 00:12:29,284
No, no, no!

172
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:36,327
R2 is right.

173
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:39,832
This is what happens
when you stay at the ship.

174
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,202
Why is this happening to me?

175
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,658
Maybe he is going to jump

176
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,095
and put himself out of his misery.

177
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,100
Well, I vote for myself as
the new leader of this mission.

178
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:29,573
You cannot vote for R2.

179
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:31,309
He is just a mech.

180
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,911
He cannot lead a squadron.

181
00:13:35,282 --> 00:13:38,586
Help!

182
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,458
There has to be something out there!

183
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,095
Show me a sign.

184
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:47,899
A glimmer of hope!

185
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,811
I do not know who he is talking to.

186
00:13:56,845 --> 00:13:58,814
Maybe whoever programmed him.

187
00:14:10,631 --> 00:14:11,631
There!

188
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:12,767
I see something.

189
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:14,303
Ooh, a village!

190
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:25,285
What are you waiting for?

191
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:26,753
We're saved!

192
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,151
What exactly do you see, Colonel?

193
00:14:48,185 --> 00:14:49,687
I don't know.

194
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,222
Hard to say.

195
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,558
An outpost.

196
00:14:52,592 --> 00:14:54,895
Maybe a cantina.

197
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,699
Whatever it is, they can help us.

198
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:06,277
I do not see anything either, R2.

199
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,879
He should have jumped.

200
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:37,352
No.

201
00:15:37,387 --> 00:15:40,891
We're going in circles again.

202
00:15:56,948 --> 00:15:58,081
I agree.

203
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,585
We cannot trust his training anymore.

204
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,222
But I cannot trust your
programming either,

205
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:06,594
especially if you will not vote
for me to be the new leader.

206
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:09,999
Where are you going now?

207
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:15,406
Hey, that is not true.

208
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,377
I am more than just a pilot!

209
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,185
We need a new plan, Colonel.

210
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,754
I just realized:

211
00:16:26,788 --> 00:16:28,789
what if I'm dead?

212
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:31,659
Ooh, what if I died
in that shuttle crash

213
00:16:31,694 --> 00:16:35,699
and now... now I'm stuck here
in limbo?

214
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,200
Yes.

215
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,236
I should have gone with the mechs.

216
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,174
Think about it.

217
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,677
Life.
Life is a void.

218
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,147
We search and search for answers,

219
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,682
but there are none.

220
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:51,152
Hope is just an illusion, WAC.

221
00:16:51,187 --> 00:16:54,523
Death is the only certainty.

222
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:58,696
Giving up is not in my programming.

223
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,034
I am surprised that it
is in yours, Colonel.

224
00:17:09,813 --> 00:17:12,049
Maybe...

225
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,217
maybe you're right.

226
00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:16,222
I was taught to find a rational solution

227
00:17:16,256 --> 00:17:17,924
to every problem.

228
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,860
But this void...

229
00:17:19,895 --> 00:17:24,033
this proves that that's not
always possible.

230
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:26,804
Maybe I need to change how I see things,

231
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,740
and that will change my programming,

232
00:17:28,774 --> 00:17:31,678
my training.

233
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:32,780
You know what?

234
00:17:32,814 --> 00:17:35,851
You are more than just a pilot, WAC.

235
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,855
I knew it!
I knew it!

236
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:44,096
All right, all right,
calm down, soldier.

237
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:06,761
Whoa! Whoa!

238
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:14,473
This is our way out of the void!

239
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,642
You have lost your mind, Colonel!

240
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:17,943
No!

241
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:19,879
This is our only hope!

242
00:18:19,914 --> 00:18:22,583
We've got to stop following my training

243
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,353
or your programming

244
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,990
and follow the birds' instincts!

245
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,426
Grab hold!

246
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:30,562
Like this?

247
00:18:30,596 --> 00:18:32,264
Whoa!

248
00:18:57,864 --> 00:18:59,632
Look.

249
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:02,903
I can see a town from here.

250
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,279
You can see that, right?

251
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,118
I sure can.

252
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,653
How did you know, Colonel,

253
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:16,656
that these creatures would
get us out of the void?

254
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,560
You've got your programming.

255
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:21,530
I've got my training.

256
00:19:21,564 --> 00:19:24,533
But these creatures,
they have their instinct.

257
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:27,270
They know how to survive out here.

258
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:29,306
If you say so.

259
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:11,999
I don't believe it.

260
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,936
Those mechs beat us here.

261
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:17,707
Stupid lucky droids.

262
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:20,578
Just like you said, Colonel.

263
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:21,914
Tell you what, WAC.

264
00:20:21,982 --> 00:20:24,784
Why don't you get the squad
ready to roll?

265
00:20:24,819 --> 00:20:27,755
I've got a second chance
to complete this mission,

266
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,460
and I intend to take advantage of it.

267
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:34,398
After I rehydrate myself.

268
00:20:34,432 --> 00:20:37,904
That'll be all, Corporal.

269
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,474
Corporal?

270
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:41,776
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,446
The squad will be ready to roll.

272
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:47,984
Attention!

273
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:50,487
Front and center, soldiers!

274
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,460
I want us ready to roll pronto, pronto!

275
00:20:57,498 --> 00:21:00,701
That is Corporal WAC to you, soldier.

276
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:04,506
And I will not tolerate insubordination!

1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,938
War in the Inner Rim!

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,816
Rebel leader Steela Gerrera
has joined forces with General Tandin

3
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:28,987
after boldly rescuing Onderon's
former king from execution,

4
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,990
evading a trap set
by Separatist ally King Rash

5
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,159
and the droid General Kalani.

6
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,912
Amid growing public support
and rising unrest,

7
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,665
Ahsoka continues to monitor
the rebels' efforts

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,294
as they rally around Ramsis Dendup
to restore his reign as the rightful king

9
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:48,799
and finally put an end to the Separatist
occupation of Onderon.

10
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:06,191
I'm picking up an electromagnetic field.

11
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,986
Roger, roger. It's coming from there.

12
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,369
Whoa!

13
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,746
My fellow subjects,

14
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,040
I appear not as your king,

15
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,751
but as a servant of Onderon.

16
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,713
We are in the midst of a great struggle.

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:32,176
The Confederacy has used
the recent attacks as an opportunity

18
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,429
to tighten their hold on Onderon.

19
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:39,600
They have accused me of leading
these so-called terrorists.

20
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:46,231
It is a lie they have engineered to further
restrict your independence

21
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,484
and use deadly force against our people.

22
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,280
The truth is,
I have never met them before now.

23
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:57,784
I have come to know them
as the true sons of Onderon.

24
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,913
They are unwilling
to surrender our freedom

25
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,332
to those who conspire to take it from us.

26
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,962
Our destiny is tied to them and this planet.

27
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:12,758
We must all rise together to protect it.

28
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,598
Uh-oh.

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,808
Why are they looking at us that way?

30
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,311
Hey!

31
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,981
What the... Blast him!

32
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,614
Uh-oh.

33
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,180
The people are turning against the droids.
There's rioting in the streets now.

34
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,932
That's a beautiful thing.

35
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,561
We need to keep the battle
to the outskirts of the city.

36
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,063
Less structures and people.

37
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:11,775
But less clankers.
Their main force is in Iziz.

38
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,404
We should join the fight down there
and take it straight to King Rash.

39
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,116
We all want victory,
but not at the cost of innocent lives.

40
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:21,994
If we fight door to door, no one is safe.

41
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,162
This is war, Steela.

42
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,665
- She's right.
- I agree.

43
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,585
The more you draw the droids
from the city to the highlands,

44
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,336
the safer the people will be.

45
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,630
My men await your command, my lord.

46
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,384
I believe there is a new contender.

47
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:42,306
You will lead our forces.
Including the royal army.

48
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,767
Steela is now the commanding general.

49
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,811
A great choice.

50
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,856
As you wish, my lord.

51
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,068
You and your rebels renewed
my faith in myself.

52
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,197
Now, I'm putting my faith in you.

53
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,532
Thank you, Your Majesty.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,910
Let's ride.

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,761
Just in case.

56
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,915
We are losing the public.

57
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,752
If they turn against us, I fear the outcome.

58
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,755
Fear will bring them back.

59
00:04:56,922 --> 00:05:00,259
We must eliminate Dendup,
General Tandin and the terrorists

60
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,594
before the people commit to their efforts.

61
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,013
General Tandin is weak.

62
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,184
His army will not withstand the power
of the Confederacy.

63
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,812
Neither will the terrorists.

64
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:15,399
General, our scouts have located
the main rebel forces

65
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,734
in the mountains to the east.

66
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,486
With the rioting in the city,

67
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,239
how can we spare the troops
to attack the rebels in the mountains?

68
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,659
Do not underestimate our means.

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,330
If the rebel army falls,
the citizens will lose their courage.

70
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,833
Then order will be restored.

71
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,845
Your target lies in the mountains
to the east.

72
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,849
The army will follow. Leave no survivors.

73
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,143
- Go!
- By your command.

74
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,286
The droid army is almost here.

75
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,079
Everyone, get ready.

76
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,347
Ready!

77
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,641
Saw, begin your attack.

78
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:32,953
No!

79
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,746
Where did that come from?

80
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,914
There!

81
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,502
Any ideas?

82
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,254
Yeah. Run!

83
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,140
I take it the rebels
have Dooku's full attention.

84
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:39,853
It's a full-scale war! They need our help!
Please talk to the Council.

85
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,689
Even Master Windu would be wary
at this point.

86
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,777
The Council will not engage or involve
the Republic in an internal affair.

87
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,155
The Separatists have a new gunship
with a powerful ray shield.

88
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,990
Nothing's getting past it.

89
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:55,369
I am sorry, Ahsoka.
They will have to find a way.

90
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,330
Do not stay there if their failure is certain.

91
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,834
Evacuate who you can
and return to Coruscant immediately.

92
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,126
Do you understand?

93
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:04,837
Yes, Master.

94
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,798
We need to help them.

95
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,051
We will do what we can
to relocate the survivors.

96
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,011
Before they lose their planet.

97
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,513
We can't.

98
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:18,350
What difference does it make now?
The Separatists know we're involved.

99
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,311
I don't disagree with you, Anakin.

100
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:24,690
But to send in Republic gunships
defeats our purpose.

101
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:29,486
We must stay true to our intentions.
Learn our lessons.

102
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,447
It doesn't have to look like
we're the ones helping.

103
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,992
What if another party was involved?

104
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,618
Another party?

105
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,540
Who in the galaxy would be running around
with an extra batch of missiles?

106
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,836
Hondo.

107
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,306
Is the Republic going to help us?

108
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,640
No.

109
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,475
What's it going to take?

110
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,811
King Rash rules Onderon.

111
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,898
Unless that changes,
the Republic can't do anything.

112
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,317
They're pulling back. Cover them.

113
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,583
At this rate, the clankers
aren't gonna need reinforcements.

114
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,543
We have to regroup at the Nest.

115
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:03,121
Skywalker, my old friend. You come alone?

116
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,748
For your service.

117
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,751
Oh! Business? Good, good, good.

118
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,295
That, I understand.

119
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,297
I need you to make a delivery for me.

120
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:19,096
And that is all I am to you Jedi?
A delivery boy?

121
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,807
I know that if I need arms shipped illegally,

122
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,767
you're the man I need to go to.

123
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,103
Illegally?

124
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:29,314
Now why would a Jedi need
to deliver arms

125
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,275
illegally?

126
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:34,486
How about I pay you well enough
that you just deliver the missiles for me

127
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,321
and don't ask any questions?

128
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,660
Well, as long as you're not paying me
in credits,

129
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,831
I'm sure I could accommodate
your wishes, Master Jedi.

130
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,800
The highlands may slow down the droids
but they won't stop the gunships.

131
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,177
We have to move.

132
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,387
Any word from Master Skywalker?

133
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,763
Not yet.

134
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,185
We're not giving up yet.

135
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,605
Stagger our defenses to the camp.
Secure the approach.

136
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,858
Stay in small teams.
Make use of our training.

137
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,527
You really are the best leader among us.

138
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,197
Couldn't be more proud of you, my sister.

139
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:21,533
I learned from the best, big brother.

140
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,036
Let's go, General.

141
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,872
You have to help us.

142
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,208
I'll do all I can to protect you.

143
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:31,710
But I can't fight this war for you.

144
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:36,048
We wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

145
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,050
I wish I could do more.

146
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,553
Wait, looks like we have company.

147
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,607
Don't shoot!

148
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,909
Well!

149
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:07,913
You could be my new favorite spice.

150
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,998
Yeah, I don't think so.

151
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:11,375
Careful, pirate.

152
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,044
Hondo, what are you doing here?

153
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,546
No, no, no, no.

154
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,631
You should thank me, child.

155
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:21,760
I have brought you a gift
from Skywalker and Kenobi.

156
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,137
The latest from Sienar.

157
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,389
Rocket launchers?

158
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,642
Shoulder fire. Very expensive.

159
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,185
Paid for?

160
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:32,354
Very handsome... Oh!

161
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,481
Oh, my, look at the time.

162
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,610
Well, my work here is done.

163
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,340
Ugh! They must have seen Hondo's ship.

164
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,301
It was only a patrol.

165
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,803
We have to get these down to the others.

166
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,389
- Load them up.
- I hope they work.

167
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,850
There's only one way to find out.

168
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,656
We've tried everything, but we're
target practice for those gunships.

169
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,408
Now it's their turn.

170
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,659
Thank the Jedi.

171
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,163
Saw!

172
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:43,675
I love this!

173
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:45,594
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

174
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,184
Distribute the rocket launchers
and take out those gunships.

175
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,145
Steela, they're attacking the Nest!
They're after the King!

176
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,522
Come on!

177
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,947
She sure leads by example.

178
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,699
What good will that do us
if she gets herself killed?

179
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,504
Steela, hurry!

180
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:22,047
Steela, come in!

181
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,340
Ugh!

182
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,175
Where is the false king?

183
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,678
I'll never tell you!

184
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,513
Ugh!

185
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,223
Find the king.

186
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:51,577
Help has arrived!

187
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,126
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

188
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,337
Thanks to you.

189
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,297
Fire!

190
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:49,843
Last one's mine.

191
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,267
Look out!

192
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,493
Look!

193
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,632
Hang on!

194
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:31,677
Steela!

195
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,734
I'll handle this.

196
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,365
I got you.

197
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,914
Your gunships have failed.
I need more reinforcements!

198
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:47,002
Really? General Kalani,
what is your assessment of the situation?

199
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,671
They have managed to
penetrate our shields,

200
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,926
and are using the cover of the highlands
against our forces.

201
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,679
To defeat them will take time.

202
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:01,433
A prolonged war
does not interest me, General.

203
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,312
The rebellion grows
with every small victory.

204
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:08,148
Then we are lost.

205
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,443
Salvage the remaining arms
and withdraw the army.

206
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,695
Bring them to Agamar.

207
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:16,823
What about...

208
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,296
It was my fault. I shot that gunship down.

209
00:19:31,797 --> 00:19:33,841
It crashed into her position.

210
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,468
Saw, it's not your fault.

211
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,137
She knew what the risks were.

212
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,641
We all knew what it would take
to free Onderon.

213
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,856
This has been quite a journey
for our Padawan.

214
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,193
Steela will be a powerful spirit
in their lives.

215
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:35,944
Yes.

216
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,030
For all of us.

217
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,370
I'm sorry for your loss.

218
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,582
Thanks.

219
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:49,791
But it's over now.

220
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,919
Let's just leave it at that.

221
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,131
Steela would be glad.

222
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:59,176
Her sacrifice gave Onderon its freedom.

223
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:01,845
But at what cost?

224
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,056
It's like you once said.

225
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:07,476
"Many lives get caught between
the Republic and the Separatists."

226
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,061
I did say that once.

227
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,606
Then after watching the heroics
and selflessness of the Jedi,

228
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,360
I do believe the Republic
is the right side to be on.

229
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:17,736
What do you mean?

230
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,739
Dendup has appointed me
the new Senator of Onderon.

231
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:23,075
I will follow in my mother's footsteps.

232
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,494
And I will bring us back to the Republic.

233
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,163
Remember this day!

234
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,917
The day Onderon became free again!

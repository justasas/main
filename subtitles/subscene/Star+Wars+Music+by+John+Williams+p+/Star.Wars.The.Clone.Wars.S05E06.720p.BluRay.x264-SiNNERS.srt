1
00:00:17,944 --> 00:00:19,381
<i>As the Clone Wars</i>

2
00:00:19,415 --> 00:00:22,319
<i>scorches its destructive path
across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:25,726
<i>it is the Jedi
who bring order to the chaos.</i>

4
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:29,401
<i>Though as the war progresses, the
number of Jedi have declined,</i>

5
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:32,071
<i>and new younglings are harder to find.</i>

6
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:35,311
<i>When a youngling is located, they
are brought to the Jedi Temple</i>

7
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:39,854
<i>and learn quickly that their true
family is now the Jedi Order.</i>

8
00:00:39,889 --> 00:00:41,892
<i>The trials are hard.</i>

9
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:43,227
<i>Tests must be passed.</i>

10
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,333
<i>But none is as important
as The Gathering.</i>

11
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:50,910
<i>It is then that a Jedi's path
will truly begin.</i>

12
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,953
Hurry, younglings.

13
00:00:58,492 --> 00:01:00,863
You have proved to be
the top of your class.

14
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:04,069
And so now is the time
of The Gathering.

15
00:01:04,103 --> 00:01:08,377
For a Jedi, there is no greater
challenge or honor.

16
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:14,089
What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano?

17
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:22,123
Petro, Ganodi, Byph,
Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi,

18
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:28,250
the time has come for you
to build your own lightsabers.

19
00:01:28,284 --> 00:01:29,753
I knew it.
That's so wizard.

20
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,557
Whoa!
I knew it.

21
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,834
This is no simple task,
and many perils lie ahead of you.

22
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:42,044
Where we are going, there is no
place more sacred to the Jedi.

23
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:19,018
Not the most hospitable place.

24
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:21,489
I think that's the point.

25
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:42,330
It's a dead end.

26
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:49,144
Younglings, outstretch your
hands and focus the Force.

27
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:53,085
Together, and only together,
can we enter.

28
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:31,061
Now hurry.

29
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:33,766
The sun has already risen,
and we must begin.

30
00:03:48,797 --> 00:03:51,634
Master Yoda.

31
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:56,444
The Force made physical, a Jedi is.

32
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,650
Comes great responsibility
with that, yes?

33
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:04,660
Protect others, how does a Jedi, hmm?

34
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,169
Build your own lightsaber, you shall.

35
00:04:09,204 --> 00:04:13,244
But first, harvest your crystal,
each one of you must.

36
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,814
- See, I told you.
- Yoda, wow.

37
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,417
- No, I told you.
- No, I told you.

38
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,960
The heart of the lightsaber,
the crystal is.

39
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:25,669
Focuses the Force
from the Jedi, it does.

40
00:04:55,429 --> 00:05:01,307
If Jedi you are to become, enter
the crystal cave, you must.

41
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:08,187
Trust yourself, trust each
other, and succeed, you will.

42
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,564
Once you have found your
crystal, do not remain inside.

43
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:19,809
As daylight ends, the door will freeze
over again, and you will be trapped.

44
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:21,279
For how long?

45
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:22,748
For one rotation.

46
00:05:22,783 --> 00:05:26,055
There will be nothing
anyone can do for you.

47
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,494
How will we know
which crystal to pick?

48
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,533
Only you can know which one is yours.

49
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,602
Now, hurry.

50
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:51,172
How do they expect us
to find our crystals

51
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,810
when the whole place
is made up of ice?

52
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:56,015
I don't see the big deal, though.

53
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,119
I could easily last a night in here.

54
00:05:58,187 --> 00:06:02,194
From my calculations, taking into
account the planetary movements

55
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:08,306
in this system, um... the sun
only rises on Ilum every 19 days.

56
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,011
That's a very long night.

57
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:14,185
Well, I don't know about you
lad, but enough with the chatter.

58
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:16,989
I'm gonna be the first to get
my crystal and get out of here.

59
00:06:17,023 --> 00:06:18,759
Petro, wait.

60
00:06:18,794 --> 00:06:21,064
Maybe we should stay together.

61
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:22,468
No, thank you.

62
00:06:22,502 --> 00:06:23,836
You're on your own.

63
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,141
Come on.

64
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:27,578
We need to keep moving.

65
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,124
You're right.
He is selfish.

66
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,497
Ugh!
Which way now?

67
00:06:49,531 --> 00:06:53,337
We don't have much time, and we
have no idea where the crystals are.

68
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,576
We need to break into groups.

69
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,845
What?
No.

70
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,317
Are we Jedi or cowards?

71
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:03,424
On the count of three, close
your eyes and point to a door,

72
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,495
and that's the direction
each of us will go.

73
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:10,405
One, two, three.

74
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:19,355
Uh, sorry, Byph.

75
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,892
Looks like you're on your own.

76
00:07:23,164 --> 00:07:26,503
Byph, your instincts
told you to go that way.

77
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:29,476
You have to follow your instincts.

78
00:07:32,082 --> 00:07:34,686
You shouldn't be
afraid of monsters, Byph.

79
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,790
You're a Jedi.

80
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:04,144
That must be a crystal.

81
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,562
I don't think this is the right way.

82
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:33,469
We'd better go back.

83
00:08:33,503 --> 00:08:34,504
Wait.

84
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,175
Up there!
Look!

85
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,748
Something's flashing.

86
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,752
I can't see anything.

87
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,923
Why can't you see it?

88
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,161
Maybe because it's your crystal.

89
00:08:46,196 --> 00:08:49,000
They said only we would know.

90
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:50,637
You'll have to climb.

91
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:51,906
But up there?

92
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,145
It's... it's just so high.

93
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:57,517
I can't do that.

94
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,289
I believe in you.

95
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:03,161
What if I get up there
and there's nothing?

96
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:06,702
Well, that's a risk
you'll have to take.

97
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,238
Hey, you're lucky.

98
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:11,846
I haven't even seen anything
resembling my crystal yet.

99
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,582
Good luck.

100
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,434
A whistling?

101
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,072
I can't hear anything.

102
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:38,464
You think it's your crystal?

103
00:09:43,676 --> 00:09:45,045
Gungi, no.

104
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,581
You'll never make it.

105
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:48,986
You'll freeze to death if you fall in.

106
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,124
You need to be patient.

107
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:54,230
See how the sun is setting
and moving away from the lake?

108
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:57,703
Just like the door we came
through, it's freezing over again.

109
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:01,009
Once the water freezes over,
you'll have very little time

110
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:02,980
to get your crystal and get out.

111
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:06,755
Now excuse me.

112
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:08,225
I have a crystal to find.

113
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:10,161
And I'm running out of time.

114
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,800
Good luck, Gungi.

115
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,980
This whole thing is ridiculous.

116
00:10:53,014 --> 00:10:55,484
I don't even think
there are any crystals.

117
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,753
You hear me?

118
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:00,394
You just have us walking in
circles until we freeze to death!

119
00:11:00,428 --> 00:11:02,866
I'm never gonna find a crystal, never!

120
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,373
Whoa!

121
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:17,762
Now what?

122
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,609
Looks like I'm the first back
with my crystal.

123
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,178
That wasn't so hard.

124
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,815
And the others?

125
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:29,251
Who knows?

126
00:11:29,286 --> 00:11:31,990
I didn't wanna gloat,
since I found mine so quickly.

127
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:36,365
Show us.

128
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,419
A crystal you have found.

129
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:48,089
Water you have brought.

130
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:50,126
But that's impossible.

131
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:52,564
It was my crystal.
I was sure of it.

132
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:53,968
Mm.

133
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:56,105
So certain were you.

134
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,044
Go back, and closer you must look.

135
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:02,017
But the door is already half closed.

136
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,321
Then you better hurry.

137
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,598
Oh!

138
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:31,509
You can do this, Katooni.

139
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,179
You can do it.

140
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,554
That's impossible.

141
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:41,962
It's saying there's crystals
everywhere, but I can't see anything.

142
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:43,131
Where?

143
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:44,668
Which way?

144
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:45,702
Ah!

145
00:12:45,737 --> 00:12:47,441
You're useless!

146
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,445
Stupid, useless, dumb thing.

147
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,982
You can't even find
a simple small crystal.

148
00:13:21,775 --> 00:13:23,578
There's so many.

149
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:27,719
How am I supposed to know
which one is mine?

150
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:32,263
It's hopeless, hopeless.

151
00:14:21,015 --> 00:14:24,154
Well, that's going to take too long.

152
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:06,616
I... I'm not afraid.

153
00:15:06,896 --> 00:15:08,326
I can do this.

154
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,347
I'm a Jedi.

155
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:15,145
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force will guide me.

156
00:15:40,882 --> 00:15:42,617
I'm running out of time.

157
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,521
Where is it?

158
00:15:46,659 --> 00:15:48,795
Come on, Zatt.

159
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,739
You're gonna have to trust yourself
instead of relying on technology.

160
00:15:53,773 --> 00:15:55,475
You can do it.

161
00:16:01,288 --> 00:16:03,091
I can feel it.

162
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,727
It's close.

163
00:16:04,762 --> 00:16:06,698
I can sense it.

164
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,468
I can sense it.

165
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:15,783
That must be it.

166
00:17:49,236 --> 00:17:50,236
Ah!

167
00:17:51,674 --> 00:17:53,109
Oh, great.

168
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:07,604
Oh, no.

169
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:09,374
It's a dead end.

170
00:18:11,246 --> 00:18:12,781
Is anyone there?

171
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,251
Can you hear me?

172
00:18:14,286 --> 00:18:15,386
Great.

173
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:18,693
I have my crystal, but I'll
never get out of this place.

174
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,943
Well done, Gungi.

175
00:18:26,977 --> 00:18:29,081
But two still remain.

176
00:18:37,298 --> 00:18:40,203
Ugh!
I'm running in circles.

177
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:43,108
Petro!
Petro!

178
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Katooni?

179
00:18:45,982 --> 00:18:47,817
Petro!
I'm trapped.

180
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:49,755
Can you help me get out?

181
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:52,126
I...
I can't.

182
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,230
I still haven't found my crystal.

183
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:56,334
Petro, you can't leave me.

184
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,007
I... I have to go.

185
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,777
Petro, no!

186
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,851
Petro!
Petro!

187
00:19:08,126 --> 00:19:10,029
Will they make it, Master?

188
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,466
We should help them.

189
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,570
Left the cave, you have.

190
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:17,410
Help them, you will not.

191
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:21,284
Come on!

192
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,458
Katooni.

193
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:42,493
Katooni!

194
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:43,595
Petro?

195
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:44,630
Petro!

196
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:45,732
There's no time.

197
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,103
Put your hand on the ice.

198
00:19:47,137 --> 00:19:48,638
Together, we can break it.

199
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:07,308
I knew you'd come back.

200
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:10,248
Come on!
The doors are closing.

201
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,884
Petro?

202
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,455
Go ahead.

203
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,226
I think I see something.

204
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,395
But it's too late.

205
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:18,431
Trust me.

206
00:20:18,465 --> 00:20:19,465
Go.

207
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,374
I have my crystal,
but Petro is still inside.

208
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:43,881
Give up on your friend, do not.

209
00:20:57,943 --> 00:20:59,044
Petro!

210
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,248
You made it.

211
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,252
How did he break the ice?

212
00:21:02,286 --> 00:21:04,822
Only water made solid was the door.

213
00:21:04,857 --> 00:21:07,395
Easy to break if you have the will.

214
00:21:08,598 --> 00:21:11,970
You-you said we would be trapped.

215
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:16,480
Not by the cave you were,
but by your mind.

216
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:17,948
Lessons, you have learned.

217
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:21,590
Find courage, you did.

218
00:21:21,624 --> 00:21:27,133
Hope, patience,

219
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:33,581
trust, confidence, and selflessness.

220
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,250
Yes?

221
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:42,932
Take your crystals back to the temple
and keep them safe, young Jedi.

222
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,171
- Yes!
- So exciting.

223
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:49,111
- Yay!
- All right!

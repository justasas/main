1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,354
Terror at the Temple!

2
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,775
The Jedi Temple is in disarray
after a vicious terrorist attack.

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,111
Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano
set out to find the truth

4
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,031
of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.

5
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:36,036
Their investigation led them to discover
the true saboteur, Letta Turmond.

6
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,289
Now, the Jedi attempt to
return the Temple to normalcy.

7
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,877
But first, Master Yoda must give a eulogy
to the fallen Jedi warriors.

8
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,882
One with the Force, they are.

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,551
And our job it is

10
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:54,471
to remember that we will, in time,
also pass on.

11
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,101
Luminous beings are we,
but temporary vessels our bodies are.

12
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:02,646
And we shall all find ourselves here,
in time.

13
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,732
A moment of silence, I ask.

14
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,652
To remember and to move on.

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,157
You were close to one of them?

16
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:17,411
Tutso Mara. We trained together.

17
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,665
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,002
Live for the living Jedi, we must.

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,673
Live through us, forever they will.

20
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,488
So what happens to Letta now?

21
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,781
The bomber has been moved.

22
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,117
Moved? Where?

23
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,994
Why should she be moved?

24
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,830
The Republic military
has taken her into custody.

25
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,626
Ugh! But why? This is a Jedi matter, isn't it?

26
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,044
Clones were killed,

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,297
which makes this terrorist attack
a military matter.

28
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:14,134
An attack on the Jedi
is an attack on the Senate.

29
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,471
Admiral Tarkin is right. Letta isn't a Jedi.

30
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,641
It's not for us to be judge and jury
over a citizen of the Republic.

31
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,020
If Letta's guilty, she's guilty,
and she should be dealt with.

32
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,647
Calm down, Ahsoka.

33
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,983
Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way.

34
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,864
The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka.
Nothing will ever change.

35
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,910
The Chancellor feels very strongly
that the Jedi be removed

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,828
from as many military matters as possible.

37
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,166
You yourselves said
that you're peacekeepers,

38
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,252
not soldiers.

39
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,213
I hope Chancellor Palpatine
knows what he's doing.

40
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,175
I assure you that he rarely does anything
without a strategy.

41
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,850
I have many things to attend to, Masters.

42
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:05,894
Good day.

43
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,229
Ahsoka.

44
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,069
Go, be with your friend, Ahsoka.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,700
In ways, she is still very young.

46
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,201
Indeed.

47
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,083
- Company?
- Sure.

48
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,546
Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

49
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,925
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

50
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,763
Ahsoka, have you ever wondered if
it was right to ignore your emotions?

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,810
My master would say our struggle as Jedi
is to move past them.

52
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,937
You make it sound so easy.

53
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,232
No, it isn't easy. But it's possible.

54
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,569
Like when we were stuck inside
the battle tank on Geonosis.

55
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,487
It was hard not to be afraid.

56
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,823
Still, you and I got past it.

57
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:02,159
And I guess we'll get past this.

58
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:05,245
You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

59
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,956
I guess I fooled you

60
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,750
like I have everyone else.

61
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,418
Yes, Master.

62
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,420
Ahsoka,
we're needed in the War Room.

63
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,756
It appears the Separatists
have mounted another attack.

64
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,424
Coming, Master.

65
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,762
Look, I have to believe
that, one way or another,

66
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,598
this woman's going to pay for what she did.

67
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,309
You shouldn't keep your master waiting.

68
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,028
We've uncovered
a Separatist plan of attack.

69
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:40,447
We shall travel to the Anoit system here,

70
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,617
then move across to Saleucami.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,786
So far out of our way?

72
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:49,039
Unfortunately we must avoid
these neutral systems.

73
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,833
Excuse me, Master Jedi.

74
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,125
Yes, Admiral.

75
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:56,463
Commander Tano, your presence
is requested by prisoner Letta Turmond.

76
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,006
The prisoner from the hangar bombing?

77
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,842
Why is she asking for Ahsoka?

78
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,301
Not exactly sure.

79
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:05,013
But Commander Tano is the only person
the prisoner will speak to.

80
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,975
I'll report back with whatever I find out.

81
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,434
Yes?

82
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,729
I'm Commander Tano.
Letta Turmond requested to see me.

83
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,733
A lot of innocent people died in that blast.
Good job capturing her.

84
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:00,694
All right, scan her.

85
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,913
Leave your comlink and lightsabers here.

86
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,045
Follow me.

87
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,196
What do you want, Letta?

88
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:46,448
I was told if I ever needed help,

89
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:47,950
you were the Jedi to contact.

90
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,623
Give us a minute, please.

91
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,045
You don't have much time, Letta,

92
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:03,924
so I suggest you get
whatever you have to say off your chest.

93
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,429
The idea of feeding Jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

94
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,765
Why are you saying this now?

95
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,600
Why didn't you reveal this before?

96
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,894
Because my life is in danger.

97
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,063
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

98
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:19,982
unless you know the truth.

99
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,567
Hmm. What's the truth?

100
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,735
A Jedi.

101
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,946
A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb

102
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,781
and how to put the nano-droids in.

103
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,784
Why would a Jedi do this?

104
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,579
There are some citizens
of the Republic, like myself,

105
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,623
who believe the Jedi Order
is not what it used to be.

106
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,458
The Jedi have become warmongers.

107
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:40,627
They've become military weapons,

108
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,672
and they're killing
when they should be keeping the peace.

109
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:48,135
One of these Jedi agreed with us.
One of you wanted to make a statement,

110
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,263
and was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

111
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,308
Who?

112
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:56,894
If you protect me, I will tell you.

113
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,897
Because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up!

114
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,483
Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

115
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,155
It's...

116
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,157
Letta? Letta!

117
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,325
Letta!

118
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,330
Prisoner health critical. Holding cell 1-7-3.

119
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,624
Commander Fox, the prisoner!

120
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,334
Follow me.

121
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,088
Letta!

122
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,015
I don't know what happened.

123
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,351
Commander, she's dead.

124
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,312
I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano,

125
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,357
but all the same, you're under arrest.

126
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,027
I... No, no, I did not do this!

127
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,725
Admiral Tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

128
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,688
I went in the room to talk to Letta
and she said she was afraid of a Jedi.

129
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:29,069
You don't have to tell me
any more, Commander Tano.

130
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,405
- I don't?
- No.

131
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,948
There are recorders in every room.

132
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,579
Curiously, the sound isn't working
on this one.

133
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:43,625
It seems the Jedi she was afraid of

134
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:44,751
was you.

135
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,129
I did not kill that woman!

136
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,839
You were the only one there!

137
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,090
I know that you were upset

138
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,593
when this woman
was taken into custody by the military.

139
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,720
That means nothing!

140
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,013
I beg to differ.

141
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,766
It was someone else, Admiral!
Someone I didn't see!

142
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,103
You know that is very difficult
for me to believe.

143
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:08,358
This is a secure facility.
We do not have just anyone running about.

144
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,777
And if there was someone else,

145
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,988
why did you not sense them?

146
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,375
I said my Padawan is in there.

147
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,835
Now step aside.

148
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,796
General Skywalker,
Admiral Tarkin has ordered

149
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,466
that no one be allowed in there.

150
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,052
I don't care what she's accused of.

151
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,304
Let me in.

152
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:45,062
Sorry, sir. The Admiral's orders stand.

153
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,691
This is now a military operation,
and under his jurisdiction.

154
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,555
A key card?

155
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:22,599
Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

156
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,030
I wonder what you have planned.

157
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,210
Oh, no, this does not look good.

158
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,637
My lightsabers?

159
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,060
Hello? Who is this?

160
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,563
Why are you helping me?

161
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,567
- What's going on here?
- It wasn't me!

162
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:21,366
Alert! Alert!
The Jedi prisoner has escaped!

163
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,469
Commander Tano, stop!

164
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,350
She's heading north in the prison corridor.

165
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,809
Cut her off!

166
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,228
Copy that.

167
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,291
Oh, no.

168
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:21,134
Suspect has killed three clones. Code red!

169
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,136
If you see the target, shoot to kill.

170
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,347
Belay that order, Commander Fox!

171
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,641
She's killed troopers!

172
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,603
I know Commander Tano.
She would never do something like this.

173
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,730
- Then who did?
- Quiet!

174
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:37,943
Ahsoka! It's me, Anakin!

175
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,990
Stop running!

176
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:47,703
You can't help me, Master.
Someone's setting me up!

177
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,788
I believe you, Ahsoka!

178
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,500
But no one else will!

179
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,380
Keep searching until we find her.

180
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,631
Rex, call security.

181
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:02,843
Tell them we need to search
the entire base. Now!

182
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,512
General Skywalker has just issued

183
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,265
an all-points bulletin
on Commander Ahsoka Tano.

184
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,766
She's killed three clones

185
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,769
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

186
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,952
The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing.

187
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,746
Cell block 1218-11.

188
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:18,418
Come on, Grizzer,
there's nothing here.

189
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,053
There she is! Quick!
Stop her before she gets to the ship!

190
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,338
All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

191
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,048
- What's going on?
- We've found her.

192
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,967
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

193
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,803
Set weapons to stun. I want her alive!

194
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:58,101
Do not shoot to kill! Do not shoot to kill!

195
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,437
Try to box her in! Don't let her escape!

196
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,231
Tell me what you see, Odd Ball.

197
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,871
She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

198
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:33,804
All right, we've got her now.

199
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,069
This'll knock her off her feet!

200
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,089
Not so fast, Commander!

201
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,613
Ahsoka!

202
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,503
Ahsoka, what are you doing?

203
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,548
You didn't even try to come and help me!

204
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,133
They wouldn't let me in to talk to you!

205
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,218
You could have if you'd tried!

206
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:20,679
How would that look, Ahsoka? Huh?

207
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,515
Forcing my way in
would've made you look even more guilty.

208
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,684
I'm not guilty!

209
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:28,270
Then we have to prove you're innocent.

210
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,772
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

211
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:33,025
I don't know who to trust.

212
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:37,279
Listen, I would never let anyone
hurt you, Ahsoka. Never.

213
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,699
But you need to come back
and make your case to the Council.

214
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:46,288
No! I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

215
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,375
I am ordering you to put down
your lightsaber and come with me! Now!

216
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:52,211
Trust me.

217
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,630
General Skywalker, where are you?

218
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,381
I do trust you.

219
00:20:56,465 --> 00:21:00,761
But you know as well as I do
that no one else will believe me.

220
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:07,684
Anakin, you have to trust me now.

221
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,561
Ahsoka, I do trust you!

222
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,313
I know you do.

223
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:14,650
Wish me luck.

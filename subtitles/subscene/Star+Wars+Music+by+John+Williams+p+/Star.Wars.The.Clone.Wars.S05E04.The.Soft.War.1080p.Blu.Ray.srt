1
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,921
<i>The rebels elect a new leader!</i>

2
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,689
<i>With their training complete,</i>

3
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,758
<i>Obi-Wan and Anakin have left
Ahsoka on Onderon</i>

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,727
<i>to monitor and advise the rebels</i>

5
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,262
<i>as they continue to strike
Separatists targets</i>

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,599
<i>under the command of Steela Gerrera.</i>

7
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>Facing an escalation of rebel attacks,</i>

8
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,070
<i>the Separatists
have sent reinforcements</i>

9
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,674
<i>to strengthen their hold
on the city of Iziz,</i>

10
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:44,477
<i>as the battle for the planet unfolds.</i>

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,548
Oh, yummy, yummy.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,581
Looks like more reinforcements.

13
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,484
A small droid convoy leading
a multi-troop transport.

14
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:24,385
<i>An AAT bringing up the rear.</i>

15
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:25,953
Copy.

16
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:44,804
Ah! It's an ambush!

17
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,240
We need reinforcements.

18
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,789
Ah, no!

19
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,747
Do not be afraid,
brothers and sisters.

20
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,082
We mean you no harm.

21
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:37,723
It's time.

22
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:50,203
<i>People of Onderon,</i>

23
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:53,806
<i>the time has come
to take back our freedom.</i>

24
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,242
<i>We have all been deceived.</i>

25
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,243
<i>King Rash is a traitor</i>

26
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>who has sold Onderon to
the Separatists for the crown.</i>

27
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:04,216
But Onderon is ours.

28
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,186
We need your strength
to reclaim our planet

29
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,824
and restore our sovereignty
under our true king,

30
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,158
King Dendup.

31
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,003
The terrorists
are no longer a nuisance

32
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,873
but a threat to Onderon.

33
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:30,310
It is only a matter of time
before they are all eliminated.

34
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,648
How much longer before
they plunge us into chaos?

35
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:36,184
It seems they're only
targeting the droid army.

36
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:38,453
If you allowed
the royal Onderon militia

37
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:40,122
to assume control of security,

38
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,724
the terrorists may stop
and discuss terms.

39
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:45,727
You will assume nothing,
General Tandin.

40
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:48,196
With their coordinated attacks
and weapons,

41
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,532
it is possible they're finding
sympathy within your own ranks.

42
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,434
The threat is external,

43
00:03:53,502 --> 00:03:56,537
and your reinforcements
have done little to stop them.

44
00:03:56,605 --> 00:04:00,241
We will not negotiate with terrorists.

45
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:01,609
They fear diplomacy.

46
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,544
They embrace mayhem.

47
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:04,693
What do we know about them?

48
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:12,521
We've identified Steela Gerrera

49
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,189
as the woman in the hologram.

50
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:16,692
Her brother, Saw,
is also part of the group

51
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,729
as well as the fugitive criminal
Lux Bonteri.

52
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:22,799
The late senator Mina Bonteri's son?

53
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:24,167
Yes, my lord.

54
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,969
Why was I not told of this?

55
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,637
You just were.

56
00:04:28,705 --> 00:04:30,706
Enough.

57
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:33,175
It's clear that Dendup is behind this.

58
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:35,678
We mustn't allow his followers
any momentum.

59
00:04:35,745 --> 00:04:37,746
Justice must come swiftly,

60
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:38,981
without mercy.

61
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,349
Bring him in.

62
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:51,125
What now?

63
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:55,329
Your supporters have begun
to publicly decry my reign.

64
00:04:55,397 --> 00:04:58,599
Am I still to believe you
are not behind their attacks?

65
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:01,469
You must order them to surrender.

66
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:03,504
Impossible.

67
00:05:03,572 --> 00:05:07,041
I have been isolated and alone
without visitors,

68
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,243
confined to my prison.

69
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:14,381
Again, the will of the people
is theirs, not mine.

70
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,418
Well, then we shall see
what the will of the people

71
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,120
is made of.

72
00:05:25,592 --> 00:05:28,361
Okay, guys, put it in the back
with the rest.

73
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,563
Steela.

74
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,467
They're executing King Dendup
tomorrow in Yolahn Square.

75
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,534
Where did you hear this?

76
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:35,468
Malgan Market.

77
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,802
The merchants.

78
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,706
The Separatists are saying
he's behind our attacks.

79
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,342
More lies.

80
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,279
They're making him an example
to humiliate us.

81
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:49,315
Maybe, but their efforts
could work against them.

82
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,051
Executing him would
only make him a martyr.

83
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:53,686
We can't let him die.

84
00:05:53,754 --> 00:05:55,922
We have to break him out somehow.

85
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,058
No, we should wait
until he's in public,

86
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,426
at the execution.

87
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,428
That's where they'd expect it.

88
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,797
I know, but this is our moment.

89
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,300
We'll save him
for all of Iziz to witness.

90
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,901
We don't have much time.

91
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,871
They're counting on us to show up.

92
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,205
Where are you going?

93
00:06:13,273 --> 00:06:15,307
Trust me.

94
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,375
Stop.

95
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,111
Let me take care of this.

96
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,413
This isn't about you.

97
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,948
We can't afford
a reckless move right now.

98
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,918
Yeah?
Go write a speech about it.

99
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,855
You have to weigh the risk.

100
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,391
That's why I'm going alone.

101
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:40,931
Follow him.

102
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:52,612
Steela.

103
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,747
Saw is strong.

104
00:06:54,815 --> 00:06:56,282
He'll be fine.

105
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:58,784
He's always been brash.

106
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,252
Never thinks.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,958
He doesn't realize,
by leaving us, he's hurting us.

108
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,860
We need a plan.

109
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,162
They'd bring King Dendup
through the east entrance

110
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,265
of Yolahn Square.

111
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,968
Security will be tight.

112
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:18,003
And rescuing him will...

113
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,340
will not be easy.

114
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,043
Lux, please don't
look at me like that.

115
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,145
Forgive me.

116
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,279
I'm sorry.
I...

117
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,648
Listen.

118
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:31,617
I just need to be alone right now.

119
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,253
Gather everyone to go over the plan.

120
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,222
Of course.

121
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,237
<i>I sense fear in you, Ahsoka.</i>

122
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,039
The rebels are divided.

123
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,907
If they try to rescue the king now,

124
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,975
I'm afraid we might lose them.

125
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,044
<i>We cannot control their fate.</i>

126
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,546
It's just,

127
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,817
they're risking their lives
to save just one.

128
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,119
<i>Do not underestimate the king's power.</i>

129
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,554
<i>He represents hope</i>

130
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,623
<i>and he's critical to their success.</i>

131
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,763
I feel responsible for them.

132
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,097
<i>I know you do, Snips,</i>

133
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,301
<i>but remember, purpose
must come before feelings.</i>

134
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,269
I know, Master.

135
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,273
<i>Step in only if you must,
but remember,</i>

136
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,610
<i>if this experiment is to become
an effective strategy,</i>

137
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:32,812
<i>they must learn to survive
on their own.</i>

138
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,914
Yes, Master Kenobi.

139
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,715
I understand.

140
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:41,516
Uh, hey!

141
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,625
My lord.

142
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,360
Who are you?

143
00:09:51,428 --> 00:09:52,995
I'm Saw Gerrera.

144
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:54,897
What do you want?

145
00:09:54,964 --> 00:09:56,331
You freedom, sire.

146
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,866
You're to be executed tomorrow,

147
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,334
but I'm getting you out of here.

148
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:02,637
The people of Onderon need your help.

149
00:10:02,704 --> 00:10:05,306
Stand up.

150
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:08,476
Are you one of the meddlers
creating disorder,

151
00:10:08,544 --> 00:10:10,979
interfering in the affairs
of the throne?

152
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:15,416
Only to restore your kingship
as the rightful ruler.

153
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:17,216
I see.

154
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,386
This was all my doing.

155
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,488
I opened the door.

156
00:10:22,556 --> 00:10:25,391
That's why the Separatists are here.

157
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,427
I was faced with a difficult choice:

158
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,496
to join the Republic
or the Confederacy.

159
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,031
Both are corrupt,

160
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,936
but I had to pick a side
before one was chosen for me,

161
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,672
except I chose neither.

162
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,742
Now is the time to take back Onderon.

163
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,276
Our movement is gaining momentum.

164
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,745
It has the backing of the Jedi.

165
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,648
Jedi?

166
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,216
Yes, sire.

167
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:55,087
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

168
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,089
Follow me, sire.

169
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,258
Onderon awaits.

170
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,795
One-way shield.

171
00:11:23,048 --> 00:11:25,449
Do any of you have questions?

172
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:27,150
It's a risky plan,

173
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:28,951
but it's our best shot.

174
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,321
Ahsoka, will you join us?

175
00:11:31,388 --> 00:11:32,656
I can't.

176
00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:35,558
I've already been more involved
than the Council wanted.

177
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:39,262
I'm afraid I've been instructed
to sit this one out.

178
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,899
They have Saw.

179
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,635
He's alive, but I watched them
take him away.

180
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:49,473
We have to save him.

181
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,483
No.

182
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,985
We have to save King Dendup.

183
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,222
We don't have time
or the bodies to do both.

184
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:05,623
He's your brother.

185
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,860
That's what Saw would want,
what he would expect.

186
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,664
And I expect the same
from everyone in this room.

187
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,835
I know it's a hard choice,
but I agree.

188
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,938
Purpose must come before feelings.

189
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,922
Where are the other terrorists?

190
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,427
Onderon is our system, not yours.

191
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,438
Enough.

192
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,276
We have to keep him alive.

193
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:00,578
He is a direct link to the terrorists.

194
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,146
You pity him.

195
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,682
I pity your ignorance.

196
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,652
You can control the people of Onderon,

197
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,822
but you won't sustain it
against their will.

198
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,758
What you're doing guarantees
others will take his place.

199
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,594
They, too, will suffer.

200
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,931
Then the war is lost.

201
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,267
You have strong tactics,
but it's unfortunate

202
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,703
you cannot calculate
a different approach.

203
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:39,128
Here, drink.

204
00:13:39,196 --> 00:13:40,963
It will give you strength.

205
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:45,001
The Separatists have
very little compassion

206
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:48,470
or patience for things
that stand in their way.

207
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:49,838
Hmm.

208
00:13:49,906 --> 00:13:52,441
We have a duty
to protect what's ours, General,

209
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,977
a duty once entrusted to you.

210
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:58,213
I thought you depleted
your arrogance with Kalani.

211
00:13:58,281 --> 00:14:01,750
It replenishes every hour.

212
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:06,454
King Rash is the crowned head
of Onderon.

213
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:08,089
What's yours is his,

214
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,957
and he will do with it as he pleases.

215
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:12,326
Dendup is the true king.

216
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:14,962
Are you following his orders?

217
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,331
We take orders from no one.

218
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,166
Aligning yourself with the past

219
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,368
does not bode well for your future.

220
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,169
We share the same future.

221
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,040
We can sit here as free men
or servants of the Separatists.

222
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,742
I am free,

223
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,278
while you have chosen
to become a terrorist.

224
00:14:31,346 --> 00:14:33,947
I'm not a terrorist.
I'm a patriot.

225
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,616
And resistance is not terrorism.

226
00:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,453
King Dendup chose his people

227
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:44,124
instead of taking a side
in the intergalactic war.

228
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:48,562
Separatists have taken over
Onderon because we let them.

229
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,862
As your king,

230
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:26,166
I present to you Ramsis Dendup

231
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:28,435
not as a former king

232
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:30,303
but as a criminal

233
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:34,708
sponsoring terrorist acts
against the people of Onderon.

234
00:15:34,776 --> 00:15:36,643
But fear not, good citizens.

235
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:39,847
As your leader and protector,

236
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:43,317
I will see that you are safe
from such villainy.

237
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,653
He has betrayed you,

238
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,357
and today he will pay
for those treasonous deeds

239
00:15:49,424 --> 00:15:51,859
with his life.

240
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,931
Your people will see you
into the next world.

241
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:59,367
May you find forgiveness there.

242
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:20,151
Time to die.

243
00:16:28,794 --> 00:16:30,862
Wait for my signal.

244
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,998
Ready weapons.

245
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:39,972
Not yet.

246
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,175
Now!

247
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,155
Come on.
Go, go, go!

248
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:59,024
Come with us.

249
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,025
Blast 'em!

250
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:18,276
Follow me.

251
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:20,912
This way.

252
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:22,080
Come on.
Let's go.

253
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:38,330
Surrender now or die.

254
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,235
It's over.

255
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:46,571
Do as they say.

256
00:17:52,478 --> 00:17:55,347
Calm yourselves.
The threat is over.

257
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,449
See for yourselves as these traitors

258
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:00,219
all endure the same punishment.

259
00:18:04,258 --> 00:18:06,659
Good try, sis.

260
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:21,976
Ready weapons.

261
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:27,881
They're innocent!

262
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,049
Let them go.

263
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,852
The snake will not strike again.

264
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,220
Stop.

265
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:35,055
What?

266
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,357
The only snake I see, sire,

267
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:39,259
is you.

268
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,804
Traitor.

269
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:52,071
I was.

270
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,240
Not anymore.

271
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:01,280
What are you doing, General?

272
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,087
Go.

273
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,566
Let them through.

274
00:19:19,634 --> 00:19:20,634
Make way.

275
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,069
Everyone go with them.

276
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,136
But, sir...

277
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:24,905
Go.

278
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,678
Huh.
What now, General?

279
00:19:31,746 --> 00:19:35,115
As soon as you release me,
you'll be shot dead.

280
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:44,958
Jedi?

281
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:47,661
General, follow me.

282
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,734
After them.
Kill them.

283
00:19:53,802 --> 00:19:54,802
Kill them!

284
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:55,936
Dendup is the true king!

285
00:19:56,004 --> 00:19:57,371
We want the Separatists gone.

286
00:19:57,439 --> 00:19:58,839
Save Dendup!

287
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,926
Why now?

288
00:20:16,993 --> 00:20:19,962
It was time
for a new approach, my lord.

289
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:23,766
Do I have your loyalty?

290
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,168
And that of the army.

291
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:28,004
You also have ours.

292
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:30,673
With your rule, our numbers will grow.

293
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:34,276
Thanks, child.

294
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:36,378
Your mother would be proud.

295
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:37,947
Thank you, my lord.

296
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,317
We must first win the will
of the people.

297
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:44,186
That is the only way.

298
00:20:44,254 --> 00:20:47,389
The Separatists will assemble
their forces.

299
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:52,292
Count Dooku will want me dead
more than ever.

300
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,228
Then we'll have to teach them
another lesson.

301
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,463
Together.

302
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:04,370
Ahsoka, I knew you couldn't
resist a good fight.

303
00:21:04,438 --> 00:21:07,107
Am I becoming that predictable?

304
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,443
Only to me.

305
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,916
The Separatists definitely
know we're backing the rebels.

306
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,718
<i>Then prepare yourself.</i>

307
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:20,354
<i>The real fight is about to begin.</i>

308
00:21:20,422 --> 00:21:22,590
Will you be able to send some help?

309
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,359
<i>That's up to the Council, Ahsoka.</i>

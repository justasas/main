1
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,853
Secret weapons!

2
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,648
The Jedi Council deploys a squad of droids

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,484
on a desperate mission
aboard a Separatist cruiser.

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:28,362
Under the guidance
of Colonel Meebur Gascon,

5
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,907
the droids succeed in stealing
a crucial encryption module.

6
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:37,162
Now the Colonel and his droid squad
must return the module to the Jedi Temple

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:42,167
to crack a Separatist code detailing an
impending terror plot against the Republic.

8
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:49,007
How long until my command center
is operational again?

9
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,803
Okay, fine.

10
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:58,725
I meant, how long
until Beezee is operational again?

11
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,728
Well, make it fast!

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,233
We must get this encryption module
back to the Republic as soon as possible.

13
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,580
Uh-oh!

14
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,717
Oh, Beezee! You are all better!

15
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,889
WAC, what are you doing back here?
Who is flying this shuttle?

16
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:39,641
I have good news and bad news, Colonel.

17
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,895
The bad news is,
scans are picking up giant ice formations

18
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,313
commonly called comets

19
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:46,481
- heading straight for us.
- What?

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,902
What in the world is the good news?

21
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:53,572
At least you have a good excuse
if your mission is a failure?

22
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,200
Get out of my way.

23
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,214
Quick! Drop us out of hyperspace!

24
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,597
Whoa!

25
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,102
Look out!

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,325
The shuttle's power system

27
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,451
has been knocked out.

28
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,161
I can see that!

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,375
He says he can fix it.

30
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,189
And swinging right...

31
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,538
Auxiliary power has been restored,

32
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,373
but it is not enough to get us moving!

33
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,168
We need the primary motivators
re-established now!

34
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,628
Forget that!
We need the engines to come on!

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,630
That's what I'm saying!

36
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,685
Uh-oh. They just got bigger!

37
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,314
Come on, you lousy mechs!

38
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,863
Colonel, we are headed for that comet!

39
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,531
Brace yourself!

40
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,871
The engines are back online!

41
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,155
Whoa! Whoa!

42
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:12,479
We have lost the stabilizers
and primary control of the engines.

43
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,441
We are going to have to put her down
on that planet.

44
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,322
What planet is it?
Is it Separatist-controlled?

45
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,449
- Who cares?
- I care!

46
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,787
- We can't jeopardize the mission!
- I think we are past that point, sir.

47
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,314
We're going down!

48
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,417
I think I ruptured my gizzard.

49
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,699
Well, this is a fine mess
you mechs got us into.

50
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:57,459
Look at this! All the database says is
"Abafar: Information on planet void."

51
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:05,050
Don't be absurd! We can't just
go rushing off like fools into this void!

52
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,637
We need to stay put, consider all the facts,
and then I'll...

53
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,265
I'll draw up a reconnaissance plan
and we can...

54
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,393
Hey! Hey! Where are you going, soldier?

55
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,438
He says we have to finish our mission.

56
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:27,239
Hey! Where did you get that?
That is classified material!

57
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,953
I will not stand for insubordination!

58
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,454
Do not worry, Colonel,

59
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,666
I can lead the mission from here
and return the module.

60
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,627
Maybe they'll give me a promotion!

61
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:43,505
Over my dead body!

62
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,340
Beezee! Pop your top!

63
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,928
I will not let you droids
commandeer my mission!

64
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,667
Oh, so hot.

65
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:29,676
I can't believe I came this close
to completing my first mission,

66
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:33,222
only to get lost in this detestable desert.

67
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,224
Look on the bright side, Colonel.

68
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,351
At least it is a sunny day.

69
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:40,312
What sun? I don't see any sun.

70
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,190
It's just hot and oppressive.

71
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:45,526
Wait a minute.

72
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:47,528
There's no sun.

73
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,072
How do we know
which direction we're going?

74
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,244
You set your directional guidance
to "straight"?

75
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,998
That's all we're going on,
some rudimentary programming directive

76
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,209
in a lousy astromech?

77
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,633
Yes! I know you're designed for navigation.

78
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:13,345
But that requires map coordinates
and environmental input,

79
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,139
something we are sorely lacking here.

80
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,309
All right, we can't rely on technology.

81
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,770
We have to rely on my training,

82
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,398
something you droids don't have.

83
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,900
How do you know, Colonel?

84
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,779
Because droids don't get training!

85
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,531
You get programmed.

86
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,534
That's your weakness!

87
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,955
So how is your training
going to lead us out of this void?

88
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:45,043
Well,
my training as an officer tells me

89
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:51,216
to use all available resources
to stay alive until help comes.

90
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,887
So, your officer training,
how exactly did you learn that?

91
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,639
It was drilled into me by my superior.

92
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,310
Then you were programmed, just like us.

93
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,397
What? No!
I am not like you droids in any way.

94
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,483
I can think outside my program,

95
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,235
I mean, my training,

96
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:14,740
and I can make decisions
based on a complex analysis of a situation.

97
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,493
Which is why I insist we return to the ship.

98
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:21,747
Wait a minute. Why can't I find our tracks?

99
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,333
- There are not any.
- What?

100
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,170
I noticed it earlier.
This surface leaves no trace of us.

101
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,631
You noticed it earlier?

102
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,842
Why in the world didn't you say anything?

103
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,428
I did not think we would want
to go backwards

104
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,515
when forward seems to be the only way
out of this void.

105
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:46,271
Why are you thinking? I don't want you
to think. Thinking is my job.

106
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,440
I am the commanding officer.

107
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,442
You are just a pilot!

108
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:52,861
Oh. That hurt.

109
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,993
- I have been thinking, Colonel.
- I told you not to do that.

110
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,789
My programming keeps me focused
on the task at hand,

111
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:06,250
which means I do not have to worry
about my health,

112
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,168
I just have to worry about the mission.

113
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,962
Don't even go there.

114
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,006
- So I think...
- Don't do that!

115
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,926
...when you die, I should lead D Squad.

116
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,637
Stop!

117
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,141
You are what's killing me!

118
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:26,645
I can't believe I am forced
to justify my existence

119
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:28,313
with a droid!

120
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,650
I'm at the end! I can feel it!

121
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:36,154
All I ask is that you just let me die
with dignity!

122
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,990
Is that possible?

123
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,121
What? Our ship?

124
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,296
You stupid, lucky droids!

125
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:55,883
You have just taken us in a circle!

126
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,021
Wait a minute. Is this really our ship?

127
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,482
How long have we been gone?

128
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,699
Ugh!

129
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,703
No, it is not our ship.

130
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,872
No. No, no!

131
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,041
No, no, no!

132
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:38,342
Artoo is right. This is what happens
when you stay at the ship.

133
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,805
Why is this happening to me?

134
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:18,674
Maybe he is going to jump
and put himself out of his misery.

135
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:24,096
Well, I vote for myself
as the new leader of this mission.

136
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:33,105
You cannot vote for Artoo. He is just
a mech. He cannot lead a squadron.

137
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,733
Help!

138
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,447
There has to be something out there!

139
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,908
Show me a sign,

140
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,452
a glimmer of hope!

141
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,795
I do not know who he is talking to.

142
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,755
Maybe whoever programmed him.

143
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:14,813
There! I see something!
Oh, a village!

144
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,618
What are you waiting for?
We're saved!

145
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,013
What exactly do you see, Colonel?

146
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,016
I don't know. Hard to say.

147
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,478
An outpost. Maybe a cantina.

148
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,314
Whatever it is, they can help us.

149
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,948
I do not see anything either, Artoo.

150
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,741
He should've jumped.

151
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,396
No.

152
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:40,691
We're going in circles again!

153
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,544
I agree.
We cannot trust his training anymore.

154
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,255
But I cannot trust
your programming, either,

155
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,967
especially if you will not vote for me
to be the new leader.

156
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,137
Where are you going now?

157
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,225
Hey! That is not true!

158
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,811
I am more than just a pilot!

159
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,110
We need a new plan, Colonel.

160
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,572
I just realized. What if I'm dead?

161
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,496
What if I died in that shuttle crash
and now I'm stuck here in limbo?

162
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,122
Yes.

163
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,208
I should have gone with the mechs.

164
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:43,003
Think about it. Life.

165
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,880
Life is a void.

166
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,759
We search and search for answers,
but there are none.

167
00:16:48,926 --> 00:16:51,261
Hope is just an illusion, WAC.

168
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,389
Death is the only certainty!

169
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:58,060
Giving up is not in my programming.

170
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,313
I am surprised that it is in yours, Colonel.

171
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,573
Maybe...

172
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,492
Maybe you're right.

173
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,788
I was taught to find a rational solution
to every problem.

174
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,790
But this void,

175
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,085
this proves that that's not always possible.

176
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,755
Maybe I need to change how I see things,

177
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,259
and that will change my programming,
my training.

178
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:32,886
You know what?

179
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,722
You are more than just a pilot, WAC.

180
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,809
I knew it! I knew it!

181
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,647
All right, all righty, calm down, soldier.

182
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,336
Whoa! Whoa!

183
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,344
This is our way out of the void!

184
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,555
You have lost your mind, Colonel!

185
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:20,058
No! This is our only hope!

186
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:24,354
We've got to stop following my training
or your programming

187
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,982
and follow the birds' instincts!

188
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,609
Grab hold!

189
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,570
Like this? Whoa!

190
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,515
Look!

191
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,476
I can see a town from here!

192
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:08,857
You can see that, right?

193
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,070
I sure can!

194
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,907
How did you know, Colonel, that these
creatures would get us out of the void?

195
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,411
You've got your
programming, I've got my training.

196
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,665
But these creatures,
they have their instincts!

197
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,125
They know how to survive out here!

198
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,752
If you say so.

199
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:14,173
I don't believe it.
Those mechs beat us here!

200
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,426
Stupid, lucky droids.

201
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,511
Just like you said, Colonel.

202
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,471
Tell you what, WAC.

203
00:20:22,181 --> 00:20:24,474
Why don't you get the squad ready to roll?

204
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:27,895
I've got a second chance
to complete this mission

205
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,230
and I intend to take advantage of it,

206
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,483
after I rehydrate myself.

207
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,485
That'll be all,

208
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,612
Corporal.

209
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,407
Corporal?

210
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:43,994
Yes, sir! The squad will be ready to roll.

211
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,831
Attention!

212
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,542
Front and center, soldiers!

213
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:54,296
I want us ready to roll! Pronto! Pronto!

214
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:00,677
That is "Corporal WAC" to you, soldier!

215
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:04,515
And I will not tolerate insubordination!

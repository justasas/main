1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,770
Villainy swells!

2
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:22,940
With an army of the galaxy's
most vicious criminals,

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,108
Darth Maul and Savage Opress

4
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,945
conspire with Pre Vizsla
and the Death Watch

5
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:31,031
to topple Duchess Satine,
ruler of Mandalore.

6
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,702
While the conspirators prepare to attack
the Mandalorian capital of Sundari

7
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,287
from a base on Zanbar,

8
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:41,124
the fate of 2,000 other neutral systems
is under threat,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,546
as Darth Maul moves closer
to establishing a vast criminal empire.

10
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,840
Where are my targets?

11
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,634
We've identified them at these locations.

12
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,719
However, as I've said before,

13
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,850
if we try to take Mandalore by force,
our people will turn against us.

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:02,646
I will use my army of crime lords

15
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,900
to attack different targets across Sundari
and sow chaos

16
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,319
to undermine the Duchess's rule.

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,491
Our gangsters will make her look too weak
to maintain control.

18
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,828
Then you and your Death Watch
will capture and arrest us,

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:22,040
bringing order where
Satine's weak government could not.

20
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,500
We'll be saviors.

21
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,502
Exactly.

22
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,421
A good plan.

23
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,132
Indeed. I'll prepare the troops.

24
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,685
It's a risk to trust those monsters.

25
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,021
How do we know
they'll keep their end of the bargain?

26
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,065
We need those Sith and their thugs
to cause some pain

27
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:51,111
and show the Mandalorian people
how weak Satine really is.

28
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,362
After this is done,

29
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,865
no one will doubt why we're in power.

30
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,700
Most will welcome us.

31
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,951
Then what?

32
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,787
Then we execute Maul and those thugs.

33
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,874
Those criminals will scatter,
and Mandalore will be ours.

34
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,882
I believe Vizsla will betray us.

35
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,551
We have no other choice.

36
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,889
We cannot rule openly
without drawing the attention of the Jedi.

37
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,559
We need Vizsla as the face of our rule.

38
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,727
For now.

39
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,856
The promise of wealth
will find us a new face on Mandalore.

40
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,692
You've learned well, my apprentice.

41
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,780
Greed never fails to motivate.

42
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,932
What's the matter?

43
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:06,770
I am scanning life forms.
I believe this spice shipment is infested.

44
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:08,939
Step back.

45
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:10,607
Ah!

46
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,277
Gangsters! We're under attack!

47
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,785
Surrender!
My master is taking over these docks.

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,622
You are now under the control
of the Pyke Syndicate.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,794
Duchess, the shipping docks
are under attack.

50
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,963
By whom? The Death Watch?

51
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,008
No, it appears to be a crime syndicate.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,468
Our guards are helpless
against their numbers.

53
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:42,139
And the people are demanding
we do something to stop them.

54
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,768
Welcome to Mandalore!

55
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,148
Stand down!

56
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,651
You're now all slaves of the Black Sun Clan.

57
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,947
Fall back!

58
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,329
It's the gangsters. Lock the vaults.

59
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,331
Open the bank!

60
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:09,500
We're here for a withdrawal.

61
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,959
Guards, now!

62
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,009
The Black Sun is attacking the vaults.
Send reinforcements.

63
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,520
Take him.

64
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,360
Ah!

65
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:46,370
I need you all to remain calm.

66
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,039
These attackers are just thugs,

67
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,542
brought on by the lowest element.

68
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,043
I'm not gonna take this...

69
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,629
The Duchess Satine
has led us to ruin!

70
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,216
Death Watch!

71
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,385
Guards, stay back!

72
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,722
Vizsla, you must be the one
responsible for these attacks!

73
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,808
No, I am not responsible!

74
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,310
But I can offer a solution.

75
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,065
People of Mandalore!

76
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:20,404
I am Pre Vizsla of Clan Vizsla.

77
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,239
Death Watch is here to save you

78
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,993
from these intergalactic gangsters
that threaten our great city.

79
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:27,244
This is a war.

80
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,329
And we will win.

81
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,798
Join me and let us defend Mandalore
against the criminals.

82
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,010
We need action, not pacifism.

83
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,928
Do not listen to him!

84
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,974
His war will cause the end of Mandalore
as we know it!

85
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:51,143
We are under attack!

86
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,520
There is no time for discussion!

87
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:04,531
The name "Mandalore" should set fear
into the hearts of these gangsters.

88
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:31,850
If the people are beginning to follow you,
it is time for Death Watch to take action.

89
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,228
Make sure you put on a good show.

90
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:37,147
As you wish, Lord Maul.

91
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,164
What should we do?

92
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,874
There's nothing we can do.

93
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,418
The Duchess's forces are being overrun

94
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,587
across the entire planet.

95
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:04,508
Listen. It sounds like
there is fighting going on out there.

96
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:09,847
What's going on?

97
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,850
We're Death Watch,
and we're here to rescue you.

98
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,560
You have my thanks, soldier.

99
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,354
No, thank Pre Vizsla.

100
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:55,309
You're safe now.

101
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,022
- It's Death Watch!
- Death Watch are our saviors!

102
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,274
- They freed us.
- You're saviors!

103
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,692
- We owe them our lives!
- They saved us!

104
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,031
Stop them! They've robbed the main vault!

105
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,834
Keep up, you weaklings!

106
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:45,150
This monster will not trouble
the people of Mandalore any longer.

107
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,736
Take him away, Captain!

108
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:55,202
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

109
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,917
Duchess, Pre Vizsla and his men
have entered the palace.

110
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,545
- Should we stop them?
- How can we?

111
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,089
The people are on their side now.

112
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,765
No! There will be no bloodshed.

113
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,350
But, Duchess!

114
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,020
I will not be provoked to violence
by these terrorists.

115
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,274
Listen, Duchess. Do you hear the people?

116
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,734
They cry out for change.

117
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,530
Your weak-minded rule of Mandalore
is at an end.

118
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,241
The resurrection of our warrior past

119
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,827
is about to begin.

120
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,045
Duchess Satine
and the New Mandalorian leaders

121
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:49,131
have fled in cowardice

122
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:52,509
while the Death Watch
brought these criminals to justice.

123
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:57,264
Your new prime minister, Pre Vizsla,
leader of Death Watch,

124
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,433
exiled governor of Concordia,

125
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,602
true son of Mandalore,

126
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:06,190
presents you with the lords of the
most feared crime families in the galaxy.

127
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,233
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

128
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:24,291
You cannot hold me here!
I am the Duchess of Mandalore!

129
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,794
Your actions will bring
our civilization to ruin!

130
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,547
- Is that you, Satine?
- Almec?

131
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:35,093
Here for a visit?
Or has peace betrayed you, too, Duchess?

132
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,305
Peace exists
only in the minds of the faithful.

133
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:42,142
And faith has been
the greatest disappointment.

134
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,394
Only when it is broken.

135
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,272
What you did for the people
as prime minister

136
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,815
betrayed their trust.

137
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,403
And you betrayed mine.
Destitution leaves little room for faith.

138
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:56,698
My actions allowed the people
hope in your leadership.

139
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:00,619
The supplies I bought on the black market
kept you in power.

140
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,247
Another error of judgment.

141
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:07,209
The people made willing sacrifices
for their freedom.

142
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,253
Corruption is not the answer.

143
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,507
Then enjoy your freedom, Duchess.

144
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,760
You'll have plenty of time
to tell me all about it.

145
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,230
The transition of power will be seamless.

146
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,942
We now have the support of the people,
and Satine to bait Kenobi.

147
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:35,529
With his demise, our deal will be complete.

148
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,031
Your oversight requires correction.

149
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,951
We now have a base, an army,

150
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,913
and the means to expand
to other neutral systems.

151
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,125
It wasn't an oversight, it was intentional.

152
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,128
I don't have an interest
in the other systems.

153
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,422
Your vision no longer matters.

154
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,307
Oh, don't fret! I'll still honor our deal.

155
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,142
Kenobi will be dealt with.

156
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,978
But now, you'll do as I say.

157
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,901
The violence is over!

158
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:18,113
The last of the parasites infecting
Mandalore has been caught.

159
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:22,659
The Duchess has abandoned her duty
to protect Mandalore.

160
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:26,747
Her political dream only encourages
aggression against our planet.

161
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:33,337
We have learned from this beast
the consequences of pacifist principles.

162
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:37,508
It's now time to restore
the traditions of Mandalore!

163
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,011
No one will ever threaten us again!

164
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:46,642
Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla! Vizsla!

165
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:57,319
Vizsla has captured
the support of his people,

166
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,987
just as we planned.

167
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:02,491
However, he is not
their anointed leader yet.

168
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:07,871
There is still time for us to put in place
a leader under our control.

169
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,041
Then let us escape, and we shall find one!

170
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,545
Patience. We must move cautiously.

171
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,380
By placing us in prison,

172
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:22,052
Vizsla has unwittingly put us in reach
of several candidates for his successor.

173
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,720
Who do you mean, brother?

174
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,559
Vizsla has imprisoned the Duchess here.

175
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,521
Other political advisors of hers
will be within these walls

176
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:35,566
whom will suit our purposes well.

177
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:37,734
Hey, quiet, you two!

178
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,030
Apprentice, I wish a tour of this facility.

179
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:11,935
You are the now former
Duchess Satine, are you not?

180
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,314
What do you want, you monster?

181
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,443
Mmm. Nothing yet,
but I will have a use for you in time.

182
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,321
Where are the other leaders
of your people?

183
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,489
You should know already.

184
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:28,118
They've either sided with Vizsla
or have been killed.

185
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:31,163
There's no one left now but Almec and I,

186
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,957
but he's as corrupt and vile as you.

187
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:35,292
Really?

188
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,795
Thank you for being so cooperative.

189
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,931
Almec?

190
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:50,807
Yes?

191
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,185
I can deliver you from this prison.

192
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,938
What was your position
in this government?

193
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,315
I'm the former prime minister.

194
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,319
Satine imprisoned me
on charges of corruption and conspiracy

195
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:04,154
for using the black market.

196
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:07,032
He's a murderer.

197
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:10,410
- He calls the death of children...
- Quiet.

198
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,670
What do you want from me?

199
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:23,841
Mandalore is in need of a prime minister.

200
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,510
I thought you were in league
with Pre Vizsla.

201
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,558
We were.

202
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,852
Oh, clearly, you are powerful.

203
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:38,355
But how can two of you
overthrow Vizsla and his supporters?

204
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,858
Vizsla is a soldier.

205
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,736
And like every soldier,
he is bound by honor.

206
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,115
I will challenge him
to single combat in front of his men.

207
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,200
He will not deny me.

208
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,078
Ooh, if you defeat him,

209
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,706
according to the ancient laws of Mandalore

210
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,209
his soldiers will be
honor-bound to follow you.

211
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,044
Precisely.

212
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,091
Sir! They're attacking!

213
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,734
I challenge you, one warrior to another,

214
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,654
and only the strongest
shall rule Mandalore.

215
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,286
So be it.

216
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:35,412
Give him his weapon.

217
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,340
For Mandalore!

218
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:05,938
Like you said,

219
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,398
only the strongest

220
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,400
shall rule.

221
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,746
I claim this sword,

222
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:28,293
and my rightful place
as leader of Death Watch.

223
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,384
Never!
No outsider will ever rule Mandalore.

224
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,718
Hmm.

225
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,428
If you will not join me,

226
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:40,973
you will all die.

227
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,726
You're all traitors!

228
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,398
Unfortunately for you,
history will not see it that way.

229
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:50,941
Execute them!

230
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,640
Silence! Please! Silence!

231
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,143
Hear me now!

232
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:31,732
Duchess Satine, the so-called pacifist

233
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:35,235
who could not protect you
when your lives were at stake,

234
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,738
has murdered Pre Vizsla,

235
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,907
the true hero of Mandalore.

236
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,826
Satine is now under arrest,

237
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,746
and it was Pre Vizsla's last command

238
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,249
that I be reinstated as prime minister.

239
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,919
I know my past is checkered,

240
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:56,006
but I promise you,
I take full responsibility for my people.

241
00:20:56,507 --> 00:21:00,302
And my heart now bleeds for your pain.

242
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:05,933
However, from this point on,
Mandalore will be strong,

243
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:11,688
and we will be known as the warriors
we were always meant to be!

244
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,330
You have done well, Prime Minister.

245
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:32,209
I shall waste no time
in building my administration.

246
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:34,336
Choose wisely.

247
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,006
I will hold you personally responsible
for their failures.

248
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,759
Yes, master.

249
00:21:41,385 --> 00:21:44,555
Uh, is there anything more you require?

250
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,557
Go.

251
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,518
Rule my people.

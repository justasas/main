1
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:20,788
<i>Ahsoka Tano captured!</i>

2
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:22,890
<i>While on the run to prove her innocence,</i>

3
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:26,126
<i>Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress</i>

4
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,096
<i>to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.</i>

5
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,498
<i>The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker</i>

6
00:00:32,566 --> 00:00:35,501
<i>and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down</i>

7
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,669
<i>and bring her back to the Temple.</i>

8
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,471
<i>Now captured and imprisoned,</i>

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:44,209
<i>Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.</i>

10
00:00:44,276 --> 00:00:47,078
<i>The Senate requests
that Ahsoka Tano be indicted</i>

11
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,981
<i>for acts of treason
against the Republic.</i>

12
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,950
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have

13
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,320
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

14
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,989
<i>Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.</i>

15
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:59,657
<i>I'm afraid, Master Yoda,</i>

16
00:00:59,725 --> 00:01:03,194
<i>that the Senate believes
that an internal Jedi trial</i>

17
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,430
<i>would seem biased.</i>

18
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,065
<i>Therefore, the Senate asks</i>

19
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:10,969
<i>that the Council expel
Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order</i>

20
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,805
<i>so that she may be put
to a Republic Military tribunal,</i>

21
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:17,209
<i>where she will receive
more impartial judgment.</i>

22
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,947
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

23
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,616
<i>That would be up
to the Council, General,</i>

24
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,786
<i>but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.</i>

25
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,387
Of course.

26
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:32,990
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

27
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:36,694
Thank you, Admiral.

28
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,697
Surely we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

29
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:42,198
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

30
00:01:42,266 --> 00:01:44,500
And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

31
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:47,369
the mastermind behind the attack
on the Temple.

32
00:01:47,437 --> 00:01:52,039
She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

33
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:54,342
This alone is enough to convict her.

34
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,110
I understand your sentiment,
Obi-Wan,

35
00:01:57,178 --> 00:01:59,713
but if the Council does as you suggest,

36
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:01,649
it could be seen as an act of opposition

37
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:03,249
to the Senate.

38
00:02:03,317 --> 00:02:06,786
I'm afraid we have little choice.

39
00:02:06,853 --> 00:02:08,621
Hmm.

40
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,156
To the Chamber of Judgment,

41
00:02:10,224 --> 00:02:12,858
summon Skywalker and his Padawan,

42
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:16,861
and in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

43
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,609
You're not helping.

44
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,845
I'm sorry, Snips.

45
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:38,646
I just... I just don't know
what to do.

46
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:39,747
It's okay.

47
00:02:39,815 --> 00:02:41,015
I don't either.

48
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,583
Padawan Tano,

49
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,886
serious charges
have been levied against you.

50
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,722
How plead you?

51
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,323
Not guilty, Master.

52
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:31,126
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

53
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,095
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

54
00:03:34,163 --> 00:03:36,332
There is evidence to the contrary.

55
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,768
You were alone with
Letta Turmond when she died.

56
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:40,569
Can you explain this?

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,370
Someone used the Force against her.

58
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:45,072
Which brings us to Ventress.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,575
Can you explain your association
with her?

60
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,544
We had a mutual understanding.

61
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,946
I thought she was helping me.

62
00:03:52,013 --> 00:03:54,013
Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

63
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:55,415
found when you were apprehended,

64
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,650
the same devices used
in the bombing of the Temple?

65
00:03:57,718 --> 00:04:01,287
No, I was set up and deceived,

66
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,423
as you are being deceived now.

67
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,691
The question is, Padawan Tano,

68
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:07,726
who is deceiving us?

69
00:04:07,794 --> 00:04:10,195
Ventress, you, or someone else?

70
00:04:10,263 --> 00:04:12,130
I am not deceiving you.

71
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,433
I would assume Ventress is,

72
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,000
but I can't be sure.

73
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:18,802
My sense is clouded.

74
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,604
Clouded by the dark side

75
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:22,805
these things are, Padawan Tano.

76
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,707
Dangerously clouded,

77
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,742
but not just surrounding you,

78
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:29,611
surrounding many things in these times.

79
00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,380
You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

80
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:35,783
This meeting is just a formality!

81
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,219
Reached a decision, we have,

82
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:42,055
though not in total agreement are we.

83
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:44,291
It is the Council's opinion

84
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:46,593
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano
has committed sedition

85
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,061
against the Republic,

86
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:53,599
and thus, she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

87
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:55,034
You can't do this!

88
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,103
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

89
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:00,472
and you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

90
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,241
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

91
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,343
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts

92
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:06,878
to await your trail

93
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,748
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

94
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:14,350
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

95
00:05:29,632 --> 00:05:32,267
Padmé has agreed to represent
you before the Senate.

96
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:35,670
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

97
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,072
I am almost certain
that the person behind this

98
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,274
is Ventress,

99
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:41,777
and you know I wasn't working with her.

100
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:43,445
She was at the warehouse...

101
00:05:43,513 --> 00:05:44,445
in the room.

102
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:47,048
We fought, but she got away.

103
00:05:47,116 --> 00:05:51,353
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

104
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:54,089
No, none of the clones
reported seeing Ventress

105
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,657
at the scene.

106
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:57,025
I thought you said Ventress left

107
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,793
before you went into the warehouse.

108
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,295
That's what I thought, too,

109
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:02,731
but then she attacked me
when I got inside.

110
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:05,333
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

111
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:09,136
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

112
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:11,172
Wait, where are you going?

113
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,673
You can't leave now.

114
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,875
Yes, I can.

115
00:06:14,943 --> 00:06:19,078
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

116
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,247
Until we hear from Anakin,

117
00:06:21,315 --> 00:06:22,949
let's work on your defense.

118
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,452
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

119
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,953
I thought I was part of that Order,

120
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,523
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

121
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,791
I'm not holding out much hope

122
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,760
the Senate will treat me any better.

123
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:18,714
Anakin Skywalker.

124
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,746
I know you're behind all of this.

125
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,533
Prove it.

126
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:34,243
Leave me alone.

127
00:07:47,055 --> 00:07:48,555
Tell me what happened.

128
00:07:50,325 --> 00:07:53,260
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

129
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:56,261
I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

130
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:57,996
Bounty?

131
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,765
I was going to catch your pet

132
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:02,167
and turn her over to the authorities,

133
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,972
collect whatever bounty was due.

134
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
What stopped you?

135
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:13,713
At first... I admit... I was
just interested in the money

136
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:16,049
and a little bit of revenge,

137
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:19,518
but then I realized
your fallen Padawan and I

138
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,987
had a lot in common.

139
00:08:22,055 --> 00:08:25,058
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

140
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,426
It's true.

141
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:30,929
My master abandoned me,

142
00:08:30,996 --> 00:08:35,900
and that's exactly what you did to her,

143
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:39,737
you and your precious Jedi Order.

144
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:36,520
Ahsoka Tano,

145
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,656
you have been charged with sedition

146
00:09:38,723 --> 00:09:43,361
against the Jedi Order
and the Republic itself.

147
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,897
This court will decide your fate.

148
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:50,967
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

149
00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:56,207
Former Padawan Tano,

150
00:09:56,274 --> 00:09:58,908
I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

151
00:09:58,976 --> 00:10:01,745
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple

152
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,748
and that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

153
00:10:04,816 --> 00:10:07,751
you eliminated them one by one.

154
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,418
When you are found guilty,

155
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,954
I ask the court
that the full extent of the law

156
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,490
be brought down upon you,

157
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:16,425
including penalty of death.

158
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:22,198
After I left the warehouse,

159
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:25,368
after I left your little Padawan alone,

160
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,736
I was walking away,

161
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:29,906
and I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

162
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:31,407
But I was wrong.

163
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:34,676
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

164
00:10:34,744 --> 00:10:37,813
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

165
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:40,182
It had to be another Jedi.

166
00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:41,549
I don't believe you.

167
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:42,883
Believe it.

168
00:10:42,951 --> 00:10:45,886
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

169
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:48,054
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

170
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,157
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

171
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:55,126
You're the only one
Ahsoka had talked to.

172
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,061
That's not true.

173
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,930
What do you mean?

174
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:01,433
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

175
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:05,103
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

176
00:11:05,171 --> 00:11:07,072
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

177
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,440
in the first place.

178
00:11:08,508 --> 00:11:12,345
It was this Barriss
that told us to go there.

179
00:11:12,412 --> 00:11:15,180
If you're lying, you're dead.

180
00:11:15,248 --> 00:11:17,415
Such promises.

181
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,820
Look at the facts.

182
00:11:22,888 --> 00:11:25,555
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

183
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:27,690
to reveal the name
of the true mastermind

184
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,592
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

185
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,994
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

186
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:34,864
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

187
00:11:34,932 --> 00:11:37,499
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

188
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,735
Letta Turmond was strangled to death

189
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,337
by way of the Force.

190
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:43,906
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

191
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,875
with a method that would so obviously

192
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:47,743
tie the murder to her?

193
00:11:47,811 --> 00:11:50,946
A Jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

194
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:54,150
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

195
00:11:54,217 --> 00:11:55,718
Members of the court,

196
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:58,621
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

197
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:04,025
Well said, Senator Amidala.

198
00:12:04,092 --> 00:12:06,227
However, if she is innocent,

199
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:09,830
then why was she seen conspiring
with known Separatist terrorist

200
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,232
Asajj Ventress?

201
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,834
Ventress set me up.

202
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,769
My master will prove that.

203
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:18,005
And where is your master?

204
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:20,940
He's trying to find the real murderer.

205
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:25,044
Then maybe he should be looking at you.

206
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:51,330
Enter.

207
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:54,432
Barriss, I need to talk to you.

208
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,001
Master Skywalker,

209
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,836
how can I help you?

210
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,971
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka

211
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,306
before she was arrested.

212
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,141
What did you say to her?

213
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,409
We've been friends for a long time.

214
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,311
I was only trying to help her.

215
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:09,012
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

216
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,547
It's no trouble.

217
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:13,017
I just need to know what you told her

218
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,485
and if you told anyone else.

219
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,387
No, I thought I had a clue for her,

220
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:19,355
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

221
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,257
Who told you I spoke to her?

222
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,892
Ventress.

223
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,461
She told me.

224
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:25,996
Ventress?

225
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:28,931
Isn't she the one Ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

226
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,667
That's what Ahsoka says,

227
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,936
but I think she's wrong.

228
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:35,372
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

229
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,273
And you believe her?

230
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,675
Who else could it be if not her?

231
00:13:39,743 --> 00:13:41,010
Surely not Ahsoka.

232
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:45,281
No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either.

233
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:48,817
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth,

234
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:52,053
but there's only one way to find out.

235
00:13:53,823 --> 00:13:57,525
Funny.
Those belong to Ventress.

236
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:01,194
You should've gotten rid of them!

237
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:03,964
I think they suit me.

238
00:14:07,635 --> 00:14:12,037
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi

239
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:15,674
and think, "Surely
she cannot be this murderer"

240
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:18,644
or saboteur that they speak of."

241
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:21,947
And yet think of all the times
we have been fooled

242
00:14:22,015 --> 00:14:23,881
by the Separatists

243
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:26,084
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic

244
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:28,286
and ask yourself,

245
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:33,190
"Is this yet another
Separatist scheme?"

246
00:14:33,258 --> 00:14:36,227
Another way to rip the Jedi,

247
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:39,164
and subsequently all of us,

248
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:40,799
apart.

249
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:48,506
Ahsoka trusted you,
and you betrayed her.

250
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,241
I've learned that trust is overrated.

251
00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:52,510
The only thing
the Jedi Council believes in

252
00:14:52,578 --> 00:14:53,745
is violence.

253
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,263
Cease hostility!

254
00:15:20,903 --> 00:15:22,638
Barriss!

255
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:41,888
Look out!

256
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:27,496
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

257
00:16:36,638 --> 00:16:38,939
Ahsoka Tano,

258
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,475
by an overwhelming count of...

259
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,977
Chancellor.

260
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,212
I hope you have a reason

261
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,914
for bursting into our proceedings,

262
00:16:48,982 --> 00:16:51,217
Master Skywalker.

263
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:54,453
I'm here with evidence and a confession

264
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,454
from the person responsible
for all the crimes

265
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:59,457
Ahsoka has been accused of.

266
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:03,628
Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order

267
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:05,230
and traitor.

268
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:13,704
Barriss, is that true?

269
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,706
Tell them the truth.

270
00:17:20,377 --> 00:17:22,144
I did it

271
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:23,979
because I've come to realize

272
00:17:24,047 --> 00:17:25,514
what many of people in the Republic

273
00:17:25,582 --> 00:17:27,015
have come to realize,

274
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,917
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

275
00:17:29,984 --> 00:17:31,652
that we've so lost our way

276
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,121
that we have become villains
in this conflict,

277
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,656
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

278
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,825
all of us!

279
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,926
And my attack on the Temple
was an attack

280
00:17:40,994 --> 00:17:43,662
on what the Jedi have become,

281
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,665
an army fighting for the dark side,

282
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,401
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

283
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:52,703
This Republic is failing!

284
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,740
It's only a matter of time.

285
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,211
Take her away.

286
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,899
Ahsoka,

287
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,335
I am so sorry

288
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:31,640
about everything.

289
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,042
You have our most humble apologies,

290
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,943
little 'Soka.

291
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:39,046
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

292
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:42,650
You have shown such
great strength and resilience

293
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:46,087
in your struggle
to prove your innocence.

294
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:49,456
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

295
00:18:49,523 --> 00:18:52,426
This was actually your great trial.

296
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:54,394
Now we see that.

297
00:18:54,462 --> 00:18:57,164
We understand that the Force
works in mysterious ways,

298
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:58,931
and because of this trial,

299
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:03,670
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

300
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:07,608
Back into the Order you may come.

301
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,178
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

302
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:18,051
<i>I'm</i> asking you back.

303
00:19:45,242 --> 00:19:47,576
I'm sorry, Master,

304
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,212
but I'm not coming back.

305
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:25,211
Ahsoka, wait!

306
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,213
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

307
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:36,088
Why are you doing this?

308
00:20:36,156 --> 00:20:38,290
The Council didn't trust me,

309
00:20:38,357 --> 00:20:40,692
so how can I trust myself?

310
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,427
What about me?

311
00:20:42,495 --> 00:20:45,064
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

312
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,966
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

313
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:50,168
and I'm grateful for that.

314
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:52,404
But this isn't about you.

315
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:55,606
I can't stay here any longer,

316
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:57,575
not now.

317
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,810
The Jedi Order is your life.

318
00:20:59,878 --> 00:21:02,413
You can't just throw it away like this.

319
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,549
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

320
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:09,754
Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

321
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:12,355
without the Council

322
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,223
and without you.

323
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:18,061
I understand.

324
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:20,230
More than you realize,

325
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:24,901
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

326
00:21:26,637 --> 00:21:28,872
I know.

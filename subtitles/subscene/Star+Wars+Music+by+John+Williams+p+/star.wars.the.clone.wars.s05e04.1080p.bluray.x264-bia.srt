1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,854
The rebels elect a new leader!

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,481
With their training complete,

3
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,567
Obi-Wan and Anakin have left Ahsoka
on Onderon

4
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,863
to monitor and advise the rebels as
they continue to strike Separatist targets

5
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,032
under the command of Steela Gerrera.

6
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,744
Facing an escalation of rebel attacks,

7
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:40,165
the Separatists have sent reinforcements
to strengthen their hold on the city of Iziz

8
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,001
as the battle for the planet unfolds.

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,379
Oh!

10
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,506
Yummy, yummy!

11
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,037
Looks like more reinforcements.

12
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,957
Small droid convoy
leading a multi-troop transport,

13
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,709
with an AAT bringing up the rear.

14
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:24,877
Copy.

15
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,814
Ah! It's an ambush!
We need reinforcements!

16
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,496
No! No!

17
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,230
Do not be afraid, brothers and sisters!

18
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,857
We mean you no harm.

19
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,199
It's time.

20
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,419
People of Onderon,

21
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,714
the time has come
to take back our freedom.

22
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,467
We have all been deceived.

23
00:02:55,884 --> 00:03:00,764
King Rash is a traitor who has sold
Onderon to the Separatists for the crown.

24
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,559
But Onderon is ours.

25
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,562
We need your strength
to reclaim our planet

26
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,398
and restore our sovereignty
under our true king,

27
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,608
King Dendup.

28
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,120
The terrorists are no longer a nuisance

29
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,706
but a threat to Onderon.

30
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,793
It is only a matter of time
before they are all eliminated.

31
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,005
How much longer
before they plunge us into chaos?

32
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,674
It seems they're only targeting
the droid army.

33
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,636
If you allow the Royal Onderon Militia
to assume control of security,

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,097
the terrorists may stop and discuss terms.

35
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,392
You will assume nothing, General Tandin.

36
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,686
With their coordinated attacks
and weapons,

37
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:50,939
it is possible they are finding sympathy
within your own ranks.

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,983
The threat is external.

39
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,903
And your reinforcements have done little
to stop them.

40
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,656
We will not negotiate with terrorists.

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,409
They fear diplomacy.
They embrace mayhem.

42
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,494
What do we know about them?

43
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,795
We've identified Steela Gerrera
as the woman in the hologram.

44
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:16,340
Her brother Saw is also part of the group,

45
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,092
as well as the fugitive criminal
Lux Bonteri.

46
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:22,137
The late Senator Mina Bonteri's son?

47
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,805
Yes, my lord.

48
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,390
Why was I not told of this?

49
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:27,809
You just were.

50
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,728
Enough!

51
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,606
It's clear that Dendup is behind this.

52
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,150
We mustn't allow
his followers any momentum.

53
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,529
Justice must come swiftly, without mercy.

54
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,696
Bring him in!

55
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,207
What now?

56
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:54,628
Your supporters have begun
to publicly decry my reign.

57
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,840
Am I still to believe
you're not behind their attacks?

58
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,676
You must order them to surrender.

59
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:02,678
Impossible.

60
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:06,557
I have been isolated and alone,
without visitors,

61
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,559
confined to my prison.

62
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:13,522
Again, the will of the people is theirs,
not mine.

63
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,112
Well, then we shall see
what the will of the people is made of.

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,786
Okay, guys, put it in the back with the rest.

65
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,121
Steela!

66
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,000
They're executing King Dendup tomorrow
in Yolahn Square.

67
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,168
Where did you hear this?

68
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,211
Malgan Market. The merchants.

69
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,839
The Separatists are saying
he's behind our attacks.

70
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,924
More lies.

71
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,553
They're making him an example
to humiliate us.

72
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,765
Maybe, but their efforts
could work against them.

73
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,393
Executing him
would only make him a martyr.

74
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:55,230
We can't let him die.
We have to break him out somehow.

75
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,483
No, we should wait until he's in public.

76
00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,776
At the execution.

77
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,653
That's where they'd expect it.

78
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,239
I know. But this is our moment.

79
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,783
We'll save him for all of Iziz to witness.

80
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,327
We don't have much time.

81
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,287
They're counting on us to show up.

82
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,623
Where are you going?

83
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,790
Trust me.

84
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,918
Stop!

85
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,462
Let me take care of this.

86
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,589
This isn't about you.

87
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:22,925
We can't afford a reckless move right now.

88
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,761
Yeah? Go write a speech about it.

89
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,848
You have to weigh the risk.

90
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,768
That's why I'm going alone.

91
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:39,691
Follow him.

92
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,786
Steela.

93
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,666
Saw is strong. He'll be fine.

94
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,795
He's always been brash. Never thinks.

95
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,799
He doesn't realize by leaving us,
he's hurting us.

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,968
We need a plan.

97
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,306
They bring King Dendup through
the east entrance of Yolahn Square.

98
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,310
Security will be tight.

99
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,897
And rescuing him will not be easy.

100
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,651
Lux,

101
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,486
please don't look at me like that.

102
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,822
Forgive me. I'm sorry, I...

103
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,323
Listen,

104
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,534
I just need to be alone right now.

105
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,203
Gather everyone to go over the plan.

106
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,539
Of course.

107
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,680
I sense fear in you, Ahsoka.

108
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,849
The rebels are divided.

109
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:57,686
If they try to rescue the king now,
I'm afraid we might lose them.

110
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,813
We cannot control their fate.

111
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,356
It's just...

112
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,067
They're risking their lives to save just one.

113
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,070
Do not underestimate the King's power.

114
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,240
He represents hope
and is critical to their success.

115
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,498
I feel responsible for them.

116
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,875
I know you do, Snips. But remember,

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,169
purpose must come before feelings.

118
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:23,921
I know, Master.

119
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,048
Step in only if you must.

120
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,552
But remember, if this experiment
is to become an effective strategy,

121
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,346
they must learn to survive on their own.

122
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,891
Yes, Master Kenobi, I understand.

123
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,205
Uh...

124
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:41,373
Hey!

125
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,921
My lord.

126
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,799
Who are you?

127
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,551
I'm Saw Gerrera.

128
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,553
What do you want?

129
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:56,138
Your freedom, Sire.

130
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,099
You're to be executed tomorrow,
but I'm getting you out of here.

131
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,060
The people of Onderon need your help.

132
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,729
Stand up!

133
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:08,317
Are you one of the meddlers
creating disorder,

134
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,819
interfering in the affairs of the throne?

135
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,156
Only to restore Your Kingship
as the rightful ruler.

136
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,825
I see.

137
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:22,247
This was all my doing. I opened the door.

138
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:25,083
That's why the Separatists are here.

139
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,253
I was faced with a difficult choice.

140
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:31,089
To join the Republic or the Confederacy.

141
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,050
Both are corrupt,

142
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:37,429
but I had to pick a side
before one was chosen for me.

143
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,474
Except I chose neither.

144
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,393
Now is the time to take back Onderon.

145
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,022
Our movement is gaining momentum,
it has the backing of the Jedi.

146
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,107
Jedi?

147
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,943
Yes, Sire.

148
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,446
I've been waiting a long time for this.

149
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,283
Follow me, Sire. Onderon awaits.

150
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:02,287
One-way shield.

151
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,852
Do any of you have questions?

152
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,438
It's a risky plan, but it's our best shot.

153
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:31,108
Ahsoka, will you join us?

154
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,609
I can't.

155
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,612
I've already been more involved
than the Council wanted.

156
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,824
I'm afraid I've been instructed
to sit this one out.

157
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,869
They have Saw!

158
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,204
He's alive.
But I watched them take him away.

159
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,293
We have to save him.

160
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,044
- Yeah!
- Yes!

161
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,758
No.

162
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,762
We have to save King Dendup.

163
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,932
We don't have time or the bodies
to do both.

164
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,434
He's your brother.

165
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,353
That's what Saw would want.
What he would expect.

166
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:12,316
And I expect the same
from everyone in this room.

167
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,027
I know it's a hard choice,

168
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,403
but I agree.

169
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,864
Purpose must come before feelings.

170
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,508
Where are the other terrorists?

171
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,969
Onderon is our system.

172
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,179
Not yours.

173
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,439
Enough!

174
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,239
We have to keep him alive.
He is a direct link to the terrorists.

175
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,825
- You pity him.
- I pity your ignorance.

176
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,120
You can control the people of Onderon,

177
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:10,415
but you won't sustain it against their will.

178
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:13,502
What you're doing guarantees
others will take his place.

179
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,380
They, too, will suffer.

180
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,590
Then the war is lost.

181
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,093
You have strong tactics,

182
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:24,888
but it's unfortunate
you cannot calculate a different approach.

183
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,112
Here, drink. It will give you strength.

184
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,242
The Separatists have
very little compassion or patience

185
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,202
for things that stand in their way.

186
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,371
Hmm.

187
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,915
We have a duty
to protect what's ours, General.

188
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,418
A duty once entrusted to you.

189
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:57,629
I thought you depleted your arrogance
with Kalani.

190
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,592
It replenishes every hour.

191
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,801
Ah...

192
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,054
King Rash is the crowned head of Onderon.

193
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:09,391
What's yours is his.
And he will do with it as he pleases.

194
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,894
Dendup is the true king.

195
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,229
Are you following his orders?

196
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,732
We take orders from no one.

197
00:14:17,441 --> 00:14:20,903
Aligning yourself with the past
does not bode well for your future.

198
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,905
We share the same future.

199
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,617
We can sit here as free men
or servants of the Separatists.

200
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,452
I am free,

201
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,079
while you have chosen
to become a terrorist.

202
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,749
I'm not a terrorist, I'm a patriot.

203
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,251
And resistance is not terrorism.

204
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,922
King Dendup chose his people

205
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,258
instead of taking a side
in the intergalactic war.

206
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,261
Separatists have taken over Onderon

207
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,971
because we let them.

208
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,422
As your king,

209
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:25,843
I present to you Ramsis Dendup,

210
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,011
not as a former king,

211
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,930
but as a criminal

212
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,017
sponsoring terrorist acts
against the people of Onderon.

213
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,812
But fear not, good citizens,

214
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:39,523
as your leader and protector,

215
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,818
I will see that you are safe
from such villainy.

216
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,279
He has betrayed you,

217
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,116
and today he will pay
for those treasonous deeds

218
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,784
with his life!

219
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,248
Your people will see you
into the next world.

220
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,001
May you find forgiveness there.

221
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,687
Time to die.

222
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,365
Wait for my signal.

223
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,492
Ready weapons.

224
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:38,999
Not yet.

225
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,169
Now!

226
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,557
Come on! Go, go, go!

227
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,645
- Come with us.
- Blast them!

228
00:17:15,661 --> 00:17:16,954
Follow me!

229
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:21,792
This way! Come on, let's go!

230
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,474
Surrender now or die.

231
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:45,274
It's over. Do as they say.

232
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:54,741
Calm yourselves! The threat is over.

233
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:59,621
See for yourselves as these traitors
all endure the same punishment.

234
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,627
Good try, sis.

235
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,642
Ready weapons.

236
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,191
- No!
- They're innocent!

237
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:28,358
Let them go!

238
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,403
This snake will not strike again.

239
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:33,238
- Stop!
- What?

240
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,160
The only snake I see, Sire, is you.

241
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,215
- Traitor!
- I was.

242
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,883
Not anymore.

243
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,849
What are you doing, General?

244
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:06,438
Go.

245
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,743
- Let them through!
- Make way!

246
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,537
Everyone, go with them.

247
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,372
- But, sir...
- Go!

248
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,380
What now, General?

249
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,550
As soon as you release me,
you'll be shot dead.

250
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,184
Jedi!

251
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,019
General, follow me.

252
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,111
After them! Kill them! Kill them!

253
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:57,030
- Dendup is the true king!
- We want the Separatists gone!

254
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:16,341
Why now?

255
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,052
It was time for a new approach, my lord.

256
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,098
Do I have your loyalty?

257
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,267
And that of the army.

258
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,436
You also have ours.

259
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,272
With your rule, our numbers will grow.

260
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:32,691
Thanks, child.

261
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:35,777
Your mother would be proud.

262
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,571
Thank you, my lord.

263
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:43,118
We must first win the will of the people.
That is the only way.

264
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,122
The Separatists will assemble their forces.

265
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:51,585
Count Dooku will want me dead
more than ever.

266
00:20:52,628 --> 00:20:56,089
Then we'll have to teach them
another lesson, together.

267
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,137
Ahsoka,

268
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,805
I knew you couldn't resist a good fight.

269
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,683
Am I becoming that predictable?

270
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,477
Only to me.

271
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,317
The Separatists definitely know
we're backing the rebels.

272
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:19,613
Then prepare yourself.
The real fight is about to begin.

273
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,157
Will you be able to send some help?

274
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,660
That's up to the Council, Ahsoka.

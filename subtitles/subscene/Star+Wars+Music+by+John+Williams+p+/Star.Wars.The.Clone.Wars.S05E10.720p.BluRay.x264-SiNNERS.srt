1
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,087
<i>Secret transmission intercepted!</i>

2
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,590
<i>The Jedi Council has intercepted</i>

3
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:24,892
<i>an encoded transmission
of General Grievous.</i>

4
00:00:24,926 --> 00:00:27,328
<i>However, Republic Intelligence officers</i>

5
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>have failed to crack
the new encryption code</i>

6
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:30,965
<i>being used by the droids.</i>

7
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:33,233
<i>Fears escalate that the Separatists</i>

8
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,202
<i>are about to mount a major offensive.</i>

9
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,037
<i>Having located the source
of the transmission</i>

10
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:39,806
<i>deep in Separatist space,</i>

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>the Jedi plan a counterstrike</i>

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,676
<i>to capture an enemy decoding chip</i>

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,945
<i>which will allow them
to understand the transmission</i>

14
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:50,082
<i>and thwart the Separatist plot.</i>

15
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,721
Time is not on our side,
so I'll make this short.

16
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:58,490
You droids have been chosen
for a very important mission.

17
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,125
There's an encryption module

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,060
on board this Separatist dreadnought.

19
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,863
This device is scrambling
all Separatist communication

20
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:08,198
in the region.

21
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:11,101
We believe you five
can get behind enemy lines,

22
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:12,302
infiltrate the vault

23
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,305
without drawing attention to yourselves,

24
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:17,041
and steal that encryption module.

25
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,251
WAC-47, reporting for duty!

26
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:27,285
Sorry I am late.

27
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,686
I thought the message said to meet

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,321
in the "Jedi storeroom",
whatever that is.

29
00:01:31,356 --> 00:01:32,456
Heh.

30
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,458
So did I miss anything?

31
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,095
Fall in line, soldier.

32
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,406
So I hear we're
gonna be taking out Separatists.

33
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:52,810
I will be honest.

34
00:01:52,845 --> 00:01:55,045
Some of you may not make it back.

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,913
What...
why is he looking at me?

36
00:01:56,948 --> 00:02:00,417
Uh, were you just looking at me?

37
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,188
I... I was just kidding.

38
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:06,356
But I have faith in your abilities.

39
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,859
You are not ordinary droids.

40
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,895
You've worked with the Jedi before.

41
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,232
You are our secret weapons.

42
00:02:14,266 --> 00:02:17,101
Now, let me turn you over
to your mission leader.

43
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:19,270
The colonel is one of our top minds

44
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,905
at Strategic Command.

45
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,774
He's been with the Republic
since the Battle of Geonosis,

46
00:02:23,809 --> 00:02:25,176
Colonel Meebur Gascon.

47
00:02:35,554 --> 00:02:37,155
Thank you, Master Windu.

48
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:39,624
I'll take it from here.

49
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,093
May the Force be with you.

50
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:52,937
Attention!

51
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,843
Now, I'm only gonna say this once,

52
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,378
so turn up your audio inputs.

53
00:03:03,415 --> 00:03:06,683
Once we're inside the cruiser,
we make our way to "C" deck.

54
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:10,153
That's where their
communication center is housed.

55
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:12,555
We bypass security here and here,

56
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:14,557
divert the super battle droids here.

57
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:16,959
Then we break the vault code,
beat the swarm mines,

58
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,360
steal the encryption module,

59
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,829
and return home in time
for my promotion ceremony

60
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:22,097
to brigadier general.

61
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:23,431
Are we clear?

62
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,840
Uh... uh...

63
00:03:30,874 --> 00:03:32,542
Good, that's what I like:

64
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:34,211
no questions.

65
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:35,812
Oh.

66
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:40,083
D-Squad, fall in line!

67
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:51,194
The line starts behind me, mech.

68
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,562
Clang!

69
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:17,951
Over here, you mechs, front and center.

70
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:20,053
This is Dr. Gubacher.

71
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:23,189
- He is...
- Uh, uh, Corporal?

72
00:04:23,224 --> 00:04:24,224
Colonel.

73
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,425
Right.

74
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,795
Well, I just want
to set the record straight.

75
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,063
I am not a mech.

76
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:30,831
You called us all mechs back there,

77
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,400
but as you can see, I am a WAC.

78
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:35,436
Granted, my master's not a Jedi,

79
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,872
but I am a different class of droid...

80
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,607
better engineering.

81
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,081
As I was saying,
before I was rudely interrupted,

82
00:04:47,116 --> 00:04:50,084
Dr. Gubacher
is going to equip each of you

83
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,519
with a tactical upgrade

84
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:53,721
specially designed for this mission.

85
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,925
All right, enough with the chatter.

86
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,094
Let's get this show on the road.

87
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,630
Cyclops,

88
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:01,731
you're not needed here.

89
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,733
Go prepare our shuttle for launch.

90
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,512
R2-D2,

91
00:05:16,547 --> 00:05:18,581
these advanced rocket boosters

92
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:22,251
should give you better aerial mobility

93
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:25,154
and for longer periods of time.

94
00:05:25,188 --> 00:05:26,722
Ah, but be advised:

95
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:30,559
the navigation controls
are finely tuned.

96
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:32,494
QT-KT,

97
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:36,564
this coil
is a remote-controlled magnet.

98
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:40,801
It can attract any metal object
in a seven-meter radius.

99
00:05:41,837 --> 00:05:43,837
But when dealing with mines,

100
00:05:43,872 --> 00:05:46,473
you'll want to take care.

101
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:50,510
The magnetic force
is extremely powerful.

102
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:53,847
U9-C4,
this laser-cutter

103
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:58,317
will slice through most
materials you encounter.

104
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:00,653
But make sure
you're in a locked position.

105
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,624
The recoil packs quite a wallop.

106
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,031
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:18,669
M5-BZ, we are not
putting anything inside you.

108
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:20,771
We're taking something out:

109
00:06:20,805 --> 00:06:22,372
your memory banks.

110
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:27,578
I'll be making the extraction myself

111
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,046
in the salvage room.

112
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:34,016
I am sorry,

113
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,118
but we need to make room

114
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:37,587
for the colonel's command center.

115
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,556
No need to baby him.

116
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,924
He's just a droid.

117
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,496
Fortunately,
he won't remember any of this.

118
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,613
What do you want, BZ?

119
00:07:03,647 --> 00:07:06,115
It's me, you moron.

120
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,951
What are you doing in there, Corporal?

121
00:07:07,985 --> 00:07:10,887
And how many times
do I have to tell you?

122
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,889
It's colonel.

123
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,026
Nice setup.

124
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,728
I want to know
why I did not get an upgrade.

125
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,865
Because you are just a pilot!

126
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,100
Now do your job

127
00:07:24,134 --> 00:07:25,869
and pilot this ship!

128
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:30,100
Just a pilot...
we will see about that.

129
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:49,972
All right, Cyclops, listen up.

130
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,541
I want you to alert me
when we near the dreadnought.

131
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:55,410
I have a plan on how
to attract their attention.

132
00:07:55,444 --> 00:07:56,644
Relax.

133
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:58,580
I already took care of it.

134
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:03,652
What do you mean?

135
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:05,587
What did you do?

136
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:09,791
I put us on a collision course
with the dreadnought.

137
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:25,506
See, Corporal?

138
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:26,741
I am not just a pilot.

139
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:27,942
You idiot!

140
00:08:27,976 --> 00:08:30,044
We're caught in a tractor beam.

141
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,032
Hold it right there.

142
00:08:52,066 --> 00:08:54,001
Out of the way, tin cans.

143
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,874
Let's check the cockpit.

144
00:09:04,781 --> 00:09:07,985
No sign of life, just these droids.

145
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,689
Continue your search

146
00:09:09,723 --> 00:09:14,360
while I take these droids
in for interrogation.

147
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:24,535
Everyone just stay calm.

148
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:28,740
Oh, my gosh!

149
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:32,010
You are Republic droids!

150
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,813
That is right, and I am their leader.

151
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,450
Yeah, I got him.

152
00:09:41,054 --> 00:09:42,887
Well, thanks for the assist, QT.

153
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:00,638
All right, listen up.

154
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:03,808
The next phase of my plan
is to reach "C" deck.

155
00:10:04,843 --> 00:10:06,577
We'll take this path here.

156
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:08,513
Since the mechs
won't draw much attention,

157
00:10:08,547 --> 00:10:09,981
we'll go in a convoy.

158
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:11,948
Cyclops, you lead the way.

159
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,016
If anyone asks,

160
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:15,152
you're taking the droids
on a repair job.

161
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:16,186
Got it?

162
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:18,856
Yes, sir, uh...

163
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:19,890
Captain.

164
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:21,125
It's colonel!

165
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,560
I swear, Cyclops.

166
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:25,463
You are gonna drive me crazy.

167
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,870
Now, I want flat top

168
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:34,941
to locate the comm-vault
power supply

169
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:36,943
then use his laser to cut the main line

170
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:39,346
and cause a temporary loss in power.

171
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:42,682
You can do it, C4!

172
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,164
Oh, do not forget
to lock down your...

173
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:12,778
Sir, there was a temporary
power loss on "C" deck.

174
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:14,980
Has
the power been reestablished?

175
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,548
Yes.

176
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,884
It was only a temporary fluctuation.

177
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:21,987
Hmm, curious.

178
00:11:24,157 --> 00:11:25,557
All right, listen up.

179
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:26,592
Cutting the power

180
00:11:26,593 --> 00:11:28,360
put the comm-vault
security system

181
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:30,262
in manual override.

182
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:32,030
But someone still has to distract

183
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:33,532
some super battle droids.

184
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:35,333
Oh, please, please, please.

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,534
Let me do it, come on, come on,

186
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:39,870
come on, come on, let me do it, please.

187
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:40,905
Come on, come on.

188
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:42,974
All right.

189
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,343
You will not regret this, corporal.

190
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,378
I am not a...

191
00:11:54,286 --> 00:11:56,020
Halt.

192
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:58,055
I have been ordered by General Grievous

193
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,657
to test comm-vault security.

194
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:01,526
And I need your help.

195
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
Now, follow me.

196
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:13,203
Now, I will go inside
the comm-vault

197
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,005
and send out a power surge.

198
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,674
I need you two to stay here.

199
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,515
It will not be safe for you
while I am working.

200
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,050
Are we clear?

201
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,351
Yes, but...

202
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,386
- Good.

203
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:29,387
That is what I like:

204
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:30,554
no questions.

205
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:33,023
Huh?

206
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,994
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

207
00:12:37,028 --> 00:12:38,028
Shh.

208
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,029
Quiet.

209
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,531
We need to keep moving.

210
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:43,267
BZ, open the comm-vault
security door.

211
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,502
Uh, make sure it
is not booby-trapped.

212
00:12:56,147 --> 00:12:58,114
You blockhead!

213
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:01,384
Now we're going to lose manual override.

214
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:04,787
You... you terminated BZ.

215
00:13:04,822 --> 00:13:08,691
It's not my fault
he fried his circuitry.

216
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:13,162
I didn't tell that nitwit
to attack the access panel.

217
00:13:13,196 --> 00:13:16,733
So what do we do now, Corporal?

218
00:13:19,136 --> 00:13:22,272
Look, we can still salvage this mission.

219
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,640
If one of you could just...

220
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,875
you need to reaccess that panel,

221
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:29,478
and we have to open
that comm-vault door fast

222
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:33,382
and grab the encryption module
before we're caught red-handed.

223
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:37,419
No, I will not do it myself.

224
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:38,788
I'm an officer.

225
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:44,393
I've got no experience
in this type of crisis maneuver.

226
00:13:44,428 --> 00:13:46,896
You fought in the Battle of Geonosis.

227
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:49,465
That did not prepare you for a crisis?

228
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,902
Well, technically,
I didn't fight in that battle.

229
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:56,938
I'm a military analyst
by trade and...

230
00:13:56,973 --> 00:13:58,773
You are a map reader?

231
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,913
I am an accomplished
battlefield strategist.

232
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:08,916
I analyze the enemy terrain
and plot a course to victory.

233
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,985
In other words, you read maps.

234
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,954
You're off base here, Cyclops!

235
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:17,057
I was chosen for my fearsome cunning,

236
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:22,227
although my size
may have played a small factor.

237
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,597
But do not think for a moment

238
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,599
that Colonel Meebur Gascon

239
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:31,236
is going to relinquish command
of this mission.

240
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,406
I have waited a lifetime
for this opportunity,

241
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,176
and some ragtag collection of droids

242
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,112
is not going to deny me my destiny.

243
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,514
So one way or another,

244
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,849
I will open
that comm-vault door.

245
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,655
Oh, there, just like I planned it.

246
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,961
Now, we're
going to infiltrate this vault,

247
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,263
neutralize the swarm mines,

248
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,532
and then secure the encryption module.

249
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,000
Any questions?

250
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:06,471
Have you ever been in a battle before?

251
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,239
No, I have not.

252
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,575
But if you'd care to see
what I'm made of,

253
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,977
we can go to war right now, you and me,

254
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:16,580
and probably get ourselves
captured by a Separatist.

255
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:19,316
Or we can execute my plan

256
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,352
and come out of this mission
looking like heroes.

257
00:15:22,386 --> 00:15:26,022
The choice is yours, Cyclops.

258
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,062
First of all, my name is WAC.

259
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,600
Second of all,
we will execute your plan.

260
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:39,903
But you have to stop calling us
stupid names, Shorty.

261
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:46,942
Very well, WAC.

262
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:48,644
I'll play nice,

263
00:15:48,678 --> 00:15:52,281
but only until one of you
screws up again.

264
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:05,860
Sir, there has been another
disturbance on "C" deck.

265
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,696
I will investigate

266
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,732
this situation personally.

267
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,562
All right, Pinky...
I mean, QT.

268
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:24,330
This is your chance to shine.

269
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:28,534
Use your magnet
to attract those swarm mines.

270
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:09,138
There it is, the encryption module.

271
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:11,707
It's all up to you now, R2.

272
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,312
Not so fast.

273
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:19,814
Arms up.

274
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:27,522
Gravity.

275
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:28,557
Pop!

276
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:30,726
Right, turn it off, quick!

277
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:08,797
Thud!

278
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:16,738
Ah!

279
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,681
I will help you, Corporal.

280
00:18:34,055 --> 00:18:36,523
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

281
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:38,225
Corporal, are you okay?

282
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:39,259
Look out!

283
00:18:51,974 --> 00:18:56,810
I will turn the gravity back on.

284
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,245
Hurry, WAC, hurry!

285
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:13,161
Pop!

286
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,402
I'll take that.

287
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:22,372
Ha-ha, good work, R2.

288
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:23,907
Intruder alert.

289
00:19:23,941 --> 00:19:25,207
Intruder alert.

290
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:26,241
Intruder alert.

291
00:19:26,243 --> 00:19:27,976
Intruder alert.

292
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:29,812
Let's move it out,
D-Squad.

293
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,390
What are you doing?

294
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:42,791
We're going to get caught!

295
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,928
R2 says
we cannot leave BZ behind.

296
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:50,865
R2's right.

297
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,800
We can repair him on the shuttle.

298
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,171
There's trouble on "C" deck.

299
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:58,706
Report there immediately.

300
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:13,054
Get out of the way,
you stupid astromechs.

301
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,563
Funny thing about droids

302
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,098
last thing they'd expect to betray them:

303
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,666
another droid.

304
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,307
D-Squad, let's go home.

305
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,311
Ah, my first mission...
a rousing success

306
00:21:09,346 --> 00:21:12,982
and a brilliant plan
if I do say so myself.

307
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,385
I agree, R2.

308
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,188
The team's execution was not too shabby.

309
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,391
Who knows, you droids

310
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:26,528
might just make decent soldiers
after all.

311
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:31,532
Oh, and you, too, WAC.

312
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,801
Yes, sir, Colonel.

1
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:19,981
<i>As the Clone Wars</i>

2
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:22,919
<i>scorches its destructive path
across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:26,326
<i>it is the Jedi
who bring order to the chaos.</i>

4
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:30,001
<i>Though as the war progresses, the
number of Jedi have declined,</i>

5
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:32,671
<i>and new younglings are harder to find.</i>

6
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:35,911
<i>When a youngling is located, they
are brought to the Jedi Temple</i>

7
00:00:35,945 --> 00:00:40,454
<i>and learn quickly that their true
family is now the Jedi Order.</i>

8
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:42,492
<i>The trials are hard.</i>

9
00:00:42,526 --> 00:00:43,827
<i>Tests must be passed.</i>

10
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:46,933
<i>But none is as important
as The Gathering.</i>

11
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:51,510
<i>It is then that a Jedi's path
will truly begin.</i>

12
00:00:54,383 --> 00:00:56,553
Hurry, younglings.

13
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,463
You have proved to be
the top of your class.

14
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:04,669
And so now is the time
of The Gathering.

15
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:08,977
For a Jedi, there is no greater
challenge or honor.

16
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,689
What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano?

17
00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:22,723
Petro, Ganodi, Byph,
Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi,

18
00:01:24,776 --> 00:01:28,850
the time has come for you
to build your own lightsabers.

19
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,353
I knew it.
That's so wizard.

20
00:01:30,387 --> 00:01:32,157
Whoa!
I knew it.

21
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:37,434
This is no simple task,
and many perils lie ahead of you.

22
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:42,644
Where we are going, there is no
place more sacred to the Jedi.

23
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,618
Not the most hospitable place.

24
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:22,089
I think that's the point.

25
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,930
It's a dead end.

26
00:02:45,136 --> 00:02:49,744
Younglings, outstretch your
hands and focus the Force.

27
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:53,685
Together, and only together,
can we enter.

28
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:31,661
Now hurry.

29
00:03:31,695 --> 00:03:34,366
The sun has already risen,
and we must begin.

30
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:52,234
Master Yoda.

31
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:57,044
The Force made physical, a Jedi is.

32
00:03:57,078 --> 00:04:00,250
Comes great responsibility
with that, yes?

33
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:05,260
Protect others, how does a Jedi, hmm?

34
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,769
Build your own lightsaber, you shall.

35
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:13,844
But first, harvest your crystal,
each one of you must.

36
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,414
- See, I told you.
- Yoda, wow.

37
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,017
- No, I told you.
- No, I told you.

38
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,560
The heart of the lightsaber,
the crystal is.

39
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:26,269
Focuses the Force
from the Jedi, it does.

40
00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,907
If Jedi you are to become, enter
the crystal cave, you must.

41
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:08,787
Trust yourself, trust each
other, and succeed, you will.

42
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,164
Once you have found your
crystal, do not remain inside.

43
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:20,409
As daylight ends, the door will freeze
over again, and you will be trapped.

44
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:21,879
For how long?

45
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,348
For one rotation.

46
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:26,655
There will be nothing
anyone can do for you.

47
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,094
How will we know
which crystal to pick?

48
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,133
Only you can know which one is yours.

49
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,202
Now, hurry.

50
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,772
How do they expect us
to find our crystals

51
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:54,410
when the whole place
is made up of ice?

52
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,615
I don't see the big deal, though.

53
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,719
I could easily last a night in here.

54
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:02,794
From my calculations, taking into
account the planetary movements

55
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:08,906
in this system, um... the sun
only rises on Ilum every 19 days.

56
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,611
That's a very long night.

57
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,785
Well, I don't know about you
lad, but enough with the chatter.

58
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:17,589
I'm gonna be the first to get
my crystal and get out of here.

59
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:19,359
Petro, wait.

60
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:21,664
Maybe we should stay together.

61
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,068
No, thank you.

62
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,436
You're on your own.

63
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,741
Come on.

64
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:28,178
We need to keep moving.

65
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:34,724
You're right.
He is selfish.

66
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:50,097
Ugh!
Which way now?

67
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:53,937
We don't have much time, and we
have no idea where the crystals are.

68
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:56,176
We need to break into groups.

69
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,445
What?
No.

70
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:00,917
Are we Jedi or cowards?

71
00:07:00,952 --> 00:07:04,024
On the count of three, close
your eyes and point to a door,

72
00:07:04,058 --> 00:07:06,095
and that's the direction
each of us will go.

73
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:11,005
One, two, three.

74
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:19,955
Uh, sorry, Byph.

75
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,492
Looks like you're on your own.

76
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:27,103
Byph, your instincts
told you to go that way.

77
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:30,076
You have to follow your instincts.

78
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:35,286
You shouldn't be
afraid of monsters, Byph.

79
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,390
You're a Jedi.

80
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:04,744
That must be a crystal.

81
00:08:28,058 --> 00:08:30,162
I don't think this is the right way.

82
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,069
We'd better go back.

83
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,104
Wait.

84
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,775
Up there!
Look!

85
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,348
Something's flashing.

86
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,352
I can't see anything.

87
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,523
Why can't you see it?

88
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,761
Maybe because it's your crystal.

89
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:49,600
They said only we would know.

90
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,237
You'll have to climb.

91
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:52,506
But up there?

92
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,745
It's... it's just so high.

93
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,117
I can't do that.

94
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:00,889
I believe in you.

95
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:03,761
What if I get up there
and there's nothing?

96
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:07,302
Well, that's a risk
you'll have to take.

97
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,838
Hey, you're lucky.

98
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:12,446
I haven't even seen anything
resembling my crystal yet.

99
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,182
Good luck.

100
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,034
A whistling?

101
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:25,672
I can't hear anything.

102
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:39,064
You think it's your crystal?

103
00:09:44,276 --> 00:09:45,645
Gungi, no.

104
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,181
You'll never make it.

105
00:09:47,215 --> 00:09:49,586
You'll freeze to death if you fall in.

106
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:51,724
You need to be patient.

107
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:54,830
See how the sun is setting
and moving away from the lake?

108
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:58,303
Just like the door we came
through, it's freezing over again.

109
00:09:58,338 --> 00:10:01,609
Once the water freezes over,
you'll have very little time

110
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,580
to get your crystal and get out.

111
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,355
Now excuse me.

112
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,825
I have a crystal to find.

113
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,761
And I'm running out of time.

114
00:10:10,795 --> 00:10:13,400
Good luck, Gungi.

115
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:53,580
This whole thing is ridiculous.

116
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:56,084
I don't even think
there are any crystals.

117
00:10:56,118 --> 00:10:57,353
You hear me?

118
00:10:57,387 --> 00:11:00,994
You just have us walking in
circles until we freeze to death!

119
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,466
I'm never gonna find a crystal, never!

120
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,973
Whoa!

121
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,362
Now what?

122
00:11:22,237 --> 00:11:25,209
Looks like I'm the first back
with my crystal.

123
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:26,778
That wasn't so hard.

124
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:28,415
And the others?

125
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,851
Who knows?

126
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:32,590
I didn't wanna gloat,
since I found mine so quickly.

127
00:11:34,662 --> 00:11:36,965
Show us.

128
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:47,019
A crystal you have found.

129
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,689
Water you have brought.

130
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:50,726
But that's impossible.

131
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:53,164
It was my crystal.
I was sure of it.

132
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:54,568
Mm.

133
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:56,705
So certain were you.

134
00:11:56,739 --> 00:11:59,644
Go back, and closer you must look.

135
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,617
But the door is already half closed.

136
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:04,921
Then you better hurry.

137
00:12:24,895 --> 00:12:27,198
Oh!

138
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,109
You can do this, Katooni.

139
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:33,779
You can do it.

140
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:38,154
That's impossible.

141
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:42,562
It's saying there's crystals
everywhere, but I can't see anything.

142
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,731
Where?

143
00:12:43,766 --> 00:12:45,268
Which way?

144
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,302
Ah!

145
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:48,041
You're useless!

146
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,045
Stupid, useless, dumb thing.

147
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,582
You can't even find
a simple small crystal.

148
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:24,178
There's so many.

149
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:28,319
How am I supposed to know
which one is mine?

150
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:32,863
It's hopeless, hopeless.

151
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,754
Well, that's going to take too long.

152
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,216
I... I'm not afraid.

153
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:08,926
I can do this.

154
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:10,947
I'm a Jedi.

155
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:15,745
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force will guide me.

156
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,217
I'm running out of time.

157
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:45,121
Where is it?

158
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:49,395
Come on, Zatt.

159
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,339
You're gonna have to trust yourself
instead of relying on technology.

160
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,075
You can do it.

161
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:03,691
I can feel it.

162
00:16:03,725 --> 00:16:05,327
It's close.

163
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:07,298
I can sense it.

164
00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:09,068
I can sense it.

165
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:16,383
That must be it.

166
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:50,836
Ah!

167
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,709
Oh, great.

168
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:08,204
Oh, no.

169
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,974
It's a dead end.

170
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,381
Is anyone there?

171
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:14,851
Can you hear me?

172
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:15,986
Great.

173
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:19,293
I have my crystal, but I'll
never get out of this place.

174
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:27,543
Well done, Gungi.

175
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,681
But two still remain.

176
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:40,803
Ugh!
I'm running in circles.

177
00:18:40,838 --> 00:18:43,708
Petro!
Petro!

178
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
Katooni?

179
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,417
Petro!
I'm trapped.

180
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:50,355
Can you help me get out?

181
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,726
I...
I can't.

182
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,830
I still haven't found my crystal.

183
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,934
Petro, you can't leave me.

184
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,607
I... I have to go.

185
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,377
Petro, no!

186
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:05,451
Petro!
Petro!

187
00:19:08,726 --> 00:19:10,629
Will they make it, Master?

188
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:13,066
We should help them.

189
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,170
Left the cave, you have.

190
00:19:15,204 --> 00:19:18,010
Help them, you will not.

191
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:21,884
Come on!

192
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,058
Katooni.

193
00:19:42,092 --> 00:19:43,093
Katooni!

194
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:44,195
Petro?

195
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,230
Petro!

196
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:46,332
There's no time.

197
00:19:46,366 --> 00:19:47,703
Put your hand on the ice.

198
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:49,238
Together, we can break it.

199
00:20:05,973 --> 00:20:07,908
I knew you'd come back.

200
00:20:07,943 --> 00:20:10,848
Come on!
The doors are closing.

201
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,484
Petro?

202
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,055
Go ahead.

203
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,826
I think I see something.

204
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:17,995
But it's too late.

205
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,031
Trust me.

206
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:20,065
Go.

207
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:40,974
I have my crystal,
but Petro is still inside.

208
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:44,481
Give up on your friend, do not.

209
00:20:58,543 --> 00:20:59,644
Petro!

210
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,848
You made it.

211
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,852
How did he break the ice?

212
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:05,422
Only water made solid was the door.

213
00:21:05,457 --> 00:21:07,995
Easy to break if you have the will.

214
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:12,570
You-you said we would be trapped.

215
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:17,080
Not by the cave you were,
but by your mind.

216
00:21:17,114 --> 00:21:18,548
Lessons, you have learned.

217
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,190
Find courage, you did.

218
00:21:22,224 --> 00:21:27,733
Hope, patience,

219
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:34,181
trust, confidence, and selflessness.

220
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,850
Yes?

221
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:43,532
Take your crystals back to the temple
and keep them safe, young Jedi.

222
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,771
- Yes!
- So exciting.

223
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,711
- Yay!
- All right!

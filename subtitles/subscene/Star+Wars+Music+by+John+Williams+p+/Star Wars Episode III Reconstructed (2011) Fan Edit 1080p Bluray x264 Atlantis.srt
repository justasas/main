1
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:39,234
Lock onto him, R2.

2
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:42,773
Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead...

3
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:45,103
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,734
Oh, I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:55,386 --> 00:03:57,946
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:58,055 --> 00:04:00,353
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,358
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,360
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:20,257
Let them pass between us.

10
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,188
They're all over me.

11
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:55,673
Missiles. Pull up.

12
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,642
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

13
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,857
All right, R4.

14
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,485
No, no, no, no...
No, nothing too fancy.

15
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:16,497
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

16
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,138
We got 'em, R2.

17
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,085
Flying is for droids.

18
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:47,903
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.

19
00:05:55,514 --> 00:05:57,505
R4, be careful.
You have a...

20
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,549
Oh, dear.

21
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:06,555
They're shutting down
all the controls.

22
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:09,685
- Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.

23
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:13,729
Get to the command ship. Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

24
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:20,801
Oh! In the name of...

25
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:27,078
- Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.

26
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,249
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

27
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,423
They're all over me.
Anakin!

28
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:48,160
- Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.

29
00:06:50,703 --> 00:06:52,637
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

30
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,899
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

31
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,721
- You got him!
- Great, R2.

32
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:24,727
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

33
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,890
Well, have you noticed
the shields are still up?

34
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,991
Sorry, Master.

35
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,635
Oh, I have a bad feeling
about this.

36
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:57,620
There they are.
Get them.

37
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:17,507
The chancellor's signal is coming from right there...

38
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,674
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

39
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:22,717
I sense Count Dooku.

40
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,084
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

41
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:28,284
Spring the trap.

42
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:33,055
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

43
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,062
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

44
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,727
What's the situation, Captain?

45
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:55,224
Destroyers.

46
00:09:01,505 --> 00:09:04,338
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

47
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:05,931
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

48
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:07,236
Roger, roger.

49
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,785
Those are Jedi fighters
all right.

50
00:09:21,425 --> 00:09:23,416
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

51
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:26,792
- No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.

52
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:28,694
We don't want to get out.

53
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,499
We want to get moving.
R2, activate elevator 31174.

54
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,799
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

55
00:09:36,907 --> 00:09:38,807
R2, do you copy?

56
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:40,809
R2, activate
the elevator number...

57
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:43,141
31174.

58
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:46,181
Get back to work.
That nothin'.

59
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:49,218
Activate the elevator 31174.

60
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:51,219
R2, we...

61
00:09:56,393 --> 00:09:58,953
Always on the move.

62
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,962
R2, switch on the comlink.

63
00:10:01,064 --> 00:10:03,055
R2, can you hear me?

64
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,634
R2?

65
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:06,997
Whoa!

66
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:09,196
R2! R2!

67
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:16,009
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

68
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:20,382
Hands up, Jedi.

69
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:22,679
R2, do you copy?

70
00:10:22,786 --> 00:10:26,745
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

71
00:10:31,628 --> 00:10:34,597
Hey, you!

72
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,701
Now, that's better.

73
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,864
Uh-oh.

74
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,776
Oh, it's you.

75
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:56,477
You stupid little astro droid.

76
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:00,002
My eyes! My eyes!

77
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,150
Count Dooku.

78
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:44,452
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

79
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,977
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

80
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,506
Your swords, please.

81
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:02,065
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

82
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,407
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

83
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,647
I've been looking forward
to this.

84
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,946
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

85
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:23,510
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

86
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:14,566
I sense great fear
in you, Skywalker.

87
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:18,338
You have hate.
You have anger.

88
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,345
But you don't use them.

89
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:43,380
Good, Anakin. Good.

90
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,098
Kill him.

91
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:58,020
Do it.

92
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:12,007
You did well, Anakin.

93
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:16,045
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

94
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,546
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

95
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:24,054
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

96
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:27,188
It wasn't
the first time, Anakin.

97
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:31,064
Remember what you told me
about your mother and the Sand People?

98
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:37,433
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

99
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:44,838
Anakin,
there's no time.

100
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:48,180
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

101
00:14:48,286 --> 00:14:52,279
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

102
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,086
His fate will be
the same as ours.

103
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,291
Prepare for attack!

104
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:05,900
All batteries, fire!
Fire!

105
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:19,841
Elevator's not working.

106
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,649
R2, activate elevator 3224.

107
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,606
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

108
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:06,991
Magnetize!
Magnetize!

109
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:16,905
Fire the emergency
booster engines.

110
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,813
We're leveling out, sir.

111
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,420
Oh!

112
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,760
Easy. We're in a bit of a situation here.

113
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:44,496
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

114
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,765
- What is that?
- Uh, oops.

115
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,864
R2. R2, shut down
the elevator.

116
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,909
Too late. Jump!

117
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,187
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

118
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:10,353
R2, get down here.

119
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,727
R2, do you copy?

120
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:21,432
Ray shields.

121
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,889
R2 will be along
in a few moments...

122
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:26,560
and then... he'll release
the ray shields.

123
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,483
See? No problem.

124
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,323
Don't move.

125
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,456
Ow!

126
00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:44,031
Do you have a plan "B"?

127
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:54,269
Ah, yes.
The negotiator.

128
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:58,110
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

129
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,677
And...

130
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,277
Anakin Skywalker.

131
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,364
Your lightsabers will make
a fine addition to my collection.

132
00:18:11,472 --> 00:18:15,964
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

133
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,621
R2.

134
00:18:22,097 --> 00:18:24,793
Crush them!

135
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,959
Make them suffer!

136
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:32,667
Come. Now!

137
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:34,935
- Stay at your stations!
- Whoa!

138
00:18:41,617 --> 00:18:44,108
Get him! Get him!

139
00:18:46,555 --> 00:18:48,455
Ow!

140
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:04,371
Run!

141
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:11,470
- Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:19:22,491 --> 00:19:25,153
You lose, General Kenobi.

143
00:19:49,017 --> 00:19:51,076
Get out of here! Run!

144
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,723
Time to abandon ship.

145
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,375
All the escape pods have been launched.

146
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,538
Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

147
00:20:19,648 --> 00:20:22,640
- You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing?
- Well?

148
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:26,346
Well, under the circumstances,
I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

149
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:29,288
Strap yourselves in.

150
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,258
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

151
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:51,141
We lost something.

152
00:20:51,246 --> 00:20:53,714
Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.

153
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:00,977
Now we're really picking up speed.

154
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,427
Eight plus 60.

155
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:15,560
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

156
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,744
Steady.

157
00:21:31,953 --> 00:21:34,581
Easy, R2.

158
00:21:37,793 --> 00:21:41,490
5000. Fire ships on
the left and the right.

159
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,292
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

160
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:50,501
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

161
00:22:21,303 --> 00:22:23,567
Another happy landing.

162
00:22:53,802 --> 00:22:57,761
- Are you coming, Master?
- Oh, no. I'm not brave enough for politics.

163
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,773
I have to report
to the council.

164
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:03,558
- Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.
- All right. But you owe me one

165
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:05,611
I'll see you
at the briefing.

166
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:12,657
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

167
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:14,770
Thanks to your
two Jedi knights.

168
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:19,227
They killed Count Dooku,
but General Grievous has escaped once again.

169
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:23,281
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

170
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:27,690
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

171
00:23:27,794 --> 00:23:33,562
And I assure you, the senate will vote
to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

172
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,082
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

173
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:40,152
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

174
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,380
Thank you, Senator Organa.

175
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,050
Well, it couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

176
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,093
Now there I agree with you.

177
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,561
In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

178
00:23:51,665 --> 00:23:56,796
But the fighting will continue
until General Grievous is spare parts.

179
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,394
Well, I will do everything I can in the senate.

180
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,770
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

181
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,259
Oh, Anakin.

182
00:24:17,128 --> 00:24:19,048
I've missed you, Padmé.

183
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:22,777
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

184
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:25,153
Anakin, don't say
things like that.

185
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,209
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

186
00:24:37,471 --> 00:24:40,702
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

187
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:43,337
What's going on?

188
00:24:44,063 --> 00:24:48,432
Ani, I'm pregnant.

189
00:24:52,836 --> 00:24:54,602
Well, that's won...
That's wonderful.

190
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,111
What are we gonna do?

191
00:24:57,306 --> 00:25:00,907
We're not gonna worry
about anything right now. All right?

192
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,578
This is a happy moment.

193
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:07,579
The happiest moment
of my life.

194
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:16,912
Yes, Lord Sidious?

195
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,919
General Grievous...

196
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:24,118
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

197
00:26:24,226 --> 00:26:28,094
It will be done,
my lord.

198
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:32,462
The end of the war
is near, General.

199
00:26:32,567 --> 00:26:36,196
But the loss
of Count Dooku...

200
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:40,604
His death was
a necessary loss.

201
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:44,839
Soon I will have
a new apprentice...

202
00:26:44,946 --> 00:26:50,213
one far younger
and more powerful.

203
00:27:17,245 --> 00:27:20,271
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

204
00:27:20,382 --> 00:27:23,715
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

205
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:25,719
where we can be safe.

206
00:27:26,955 --> 00:27:30,254
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

207
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:37,561
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

208
00:27:46,168 --> 00:27:49,729
Anakin, help me!

209
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:53,012
What's bothering you?

210
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,441
Nothing.

211
00:28:59,354 --> 00:29:01,720
I remember when
I gave this to you.

212
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:06,021
How long is it gonna take
for us to be honest with each other?

213
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,530
It was a dream.

214
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:12,759
Bad?

215
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:15,302
Like the ones I used to have
about my mother...

216
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:17,304
just before she died.

217
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,306
And?

218
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,111
And it was about you.

219
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,582
Tell me.

220
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,286
It was only a dream.

221
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:47,168
You die in childbirth.

222
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:50,067
And the baby?

223
00:29:50,172 --> 00:29:52,504
I don't know.

224
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,909
It was only a dream.

225
00:29:56,011 --> 00:29:58,809
I won't let this one
become real.

226
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:02,543
This baby will change
our lives.

227
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:05,586
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

228
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,417
And if the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled...

229
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:11,014
I...I know. I know.

230
00:30:11,126 --> 00:30:14,789
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

231
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,857
We don't need his help.

232
00:30:20,202 --> 00:30:23,194
Our baby is a blessing.

233
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,551
Premonitions?
Premonitions. Hmm.

234
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,822
These visions you have...

235
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,523
They're of pain,
suffering.

236
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,367
Death.

237
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:58,838
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

238
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,367
Someone.

239
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:04,377
Close to you?

240
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,775
Yes.

241
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:11,751
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

242
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:16,153
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

243
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:21,692
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

244
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,994
Death is
a natural part of life.

245
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,764
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

246
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:33,170
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

247
00:31:33,275 --> 00:31:36,369
Attachment leads
to jealousy.

248
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,914
The shadow of greed that is.

249
00:31:40,015 --> 00:31:42,848
What must I do, Master Yoda?

250
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,977
Train yourself
to let go...

251
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:49,524
of everything
you fear to lose.

252
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:02,665
You've missed the report on the outer rim sieges.

253
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:06,506
I'm sorry. I was held up.

254
00:32:06,608 --> 00:32:10,203
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

255
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:15,716
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

256
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,808
What's wrong, then?

257
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:20,513
The senate is expected...

258
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:24,114
to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.

259
00:32:24,226 --> 00:32:28,595
Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action.

260
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,097
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

261
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,166
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

262
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,738
Be careful of what?

263
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,468
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

264
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:46,206
- He would not say.
- He didn't inform the council?

265
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:49,772
- That's unusual, isn't it?
- All of this is unusual.

266
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,319
And it's making me feel uneasy.

267
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:09,202
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

268
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,431
Of course.

269
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,507
I need your help, son.

270
00:33:15,644 --> 00:33:17,669
What do you mean?

271
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:22,978
- I'm depending on you.
- For what? I don't understand.

272
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:28,647
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

273
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,884
Anakin...

274
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:35,156
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

275
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,528
Me? A master?

276
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:42,035
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

277
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:47,033
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

278
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:50,634
I think they will.
They need you.

279
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,145
More than you know.

280
00:34:03,859 --> 00:34:08,660
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

281
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:12,164
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

282
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:14,926
I understand.

283
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:20,099
You are on this council,
but we do not grant you the rank of master.

284
00:34:20,408 --> 00:34:22,433
What?

285
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:29,711
How can you do this?

286
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:33,256
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

287
00:34:33,361 --> 00:34:36,853
Take a seat,
young Skywalker.

288
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:42,198
Forgive me, Master.

289
00:34:45,307 --> 00:34:48,242
We have surveyed all systems in the Republic...

290
00:34:48,343 --> 00:34:52,074
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

291
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,944
Hiding in the outer rim
Grievous is.

292
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,144
The outlying systems
you must sweep.

293
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,483
We do not have
many ships to spare.

294
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,784
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?

295
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:06,588
It is critical we send an attack group
there immediately.

296
00:35:06,695 --> 00:35:10,096
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

297
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:13,560
Go I will.

298
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:16,660
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

299
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:21,105
It's settled then.
Yoda will take a battalion of clones...

300
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:23,507
to reinforce
the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

301
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:25,671
May the Force
be with us all.

302
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:30,544
What kind of nonsense is this?

303
00:35:30,652 --> 00:35:33,086
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

304
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:35,884
It's never been done in the history of the Jedi.
It's insulting.

305
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,892
Oh, calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honor.

306
00:35:38,994 --> 00:35:43,021
To be on the council at your age...
it's never happened before.

307
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:46,532
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

308
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:50,435
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

309
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:56,238
- I swear to you, I didn't ask
to be put on the council.
- But it's what you wanted.

310
00:35:56,344 --> 00:35:59,677
Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine
seems to have paid off.

311
00:35:59,781 --> 00:36:01,681
That has nothing
to do with this.

312
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:04,718
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

313
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:07,811
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

314
00:36:07,922 --> 00:36:10,948
- And?
- Anakin, I am on your side.

315
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:14,324
- I didn't want to put you in this situation.
- What situation?

316
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:22,767
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

317
00:36:22,871 --> 00:36:25,237
They want to know
what he's up to.

318
00:36:29,778 --> 00:36:32,645
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

319
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:35,375
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

320
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:40,354
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

321
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:42,889
This assignment
is not to be on record.

322
00:36:42,991 --> 00:36:46,927
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

323
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:50,054
He befriended me.
He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

324
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:52,258
That is why
you must help us.

325
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,859
Anakin, our allegiance is to the senate,
not to its leader...

326
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,667
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

327
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:01,742
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

328
00:37:01,843 --> 00:37:05,006
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

329
00:37:05,113 --> 00:37:09,675
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code...

330
00:37:09,784 --> 00:37:13,515
against the Republic,
against a mentor and a friend.

331
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:17,421
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

332
00:37:19,728 --> 00:37:21,628
The council
is asking you.

333
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:33,371
Anakin did not take to his new assignment
with much enthusiasm.

334
00:37:33,475 --> 00:37:36,638
It's very dangerous, putting them together.

335
00:37:36,745 --> 00:37:39,077
I don't think
the boy can handle it.

336
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,671
I don't trust him.

337
00:37:41,783 --> 00:37:45,651
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

338
00:37:45,754 --> 00:37:49,451
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

339
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:52,424
So the prophecy says.

340
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:57,396
A prophecy
that misread could have been.

341
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:01,134
He will not let me down.

342
00:38:01,236 --> 00:38:03,170
He never has.

343
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,297
I hope right you are.

344
00:38:29,631 --> 00:38:35,001
Sometimes I wonder
what's happening to the Jedi order.

345
00:38:35,103 --> 00:38:38,129
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

346
00:38:40,008 --> 00:38:43,205
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

347
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,802
What do you mean?

348
00:38:45,914 --> 00:38:50,510
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

349
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:54,213
and the Republic has become
the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?

350
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:56,347
I don't believe that.

351
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:58,551
And you're sounding
like a separatist.

352
00:39:00,562 --> 00:39:03,497
This war represents
a failure to listen.

353
00:39:03,598 --> 00:39:05,623
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

354
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:08,998
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

355
00:39:09,103 --> 00:39:11,628
Don't ask me to do that.

356
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:16,870
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

357
00:39:16,978 --> 00:39:19,776
- What is it?
- Nothing.

358
00:39:21,115 --> 00:39:24,949
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

359
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:29,387
Hold me.

360
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:32,619
Like you did
by the lake on Naboo.

361
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:36,527
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

362
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:40,067
No politics,
no plotting, no war.

363
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,640
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin. Come closer.

364
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:25,372
I have good news.

365
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,816
Our clone intelligence units have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

366
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,819
He's hiding
in the Utapau system.

367
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,284
At last.

368
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,966
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

369
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,469
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

370
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,905
You're the best
choice, by far.

371
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,135
Hmm. Sit down.

372
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:51,146
Leave us.

373
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,027
Anakin...

374
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:09,566
you know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

375
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:15,533
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

376
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,732
I'm not sure
I understand.

377
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:21,539
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

378
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:25,012
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

379
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,908
They're planning
to betray me.

380
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:31,419
- I don't think that...
- Anakin.

381
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:34,523
Search your feelings.

382
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,287
You know, don't you?

383
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,795
- I know they don't trust you.
- Hmm. Or the senate.

384
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:51,739
Or the Republic, or democracy,
for that matter.

385
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:56,870
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

386
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,949
Why?

387
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,543
They asked you
to do something...

388
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,917
that made you feel dishonest,
didn't they?

389
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,791
They asked you to spy
on me, didn't they?

390
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,834
I don't, uh...

391
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,869
I don't know
what to say.

392
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,531
Remember back
to your early teachings.

393
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:27,941
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

394
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,709
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

395
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:34,943
Good is a point of view,
Anakin.

396
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:40,217
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost everyway...

397
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:45,023
including their quest
for greater power.

398
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,590
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

399
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,464
They think inwards...
only about themselves.

400
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,901
And the Jedi don't?

401
00:42:56,006 --> 00:43:00,568
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

402
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:15,514
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

403
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:22,198
- No.
- I thought not.

404
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,699
It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

405
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,502
It's a Sith legend.

406
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,506
Darth Plagueis...

407
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:36,274
was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise...

408
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,303
he could use the Force...

409
00:43:38,844 --> 00:43:42,041
to create... life.

410
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:46,743
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

411
00:43:46,853 --> 00:43:51,881
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

412
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:53,892
from dying.

413
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:02,031
He could actually...
save people from death?

414
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:07,402
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

415
00:44:07,507 --> 00:44:11,739
some consider to be unnatural.

416
00:44:12,846 --> 00:44:14,711
Wh...What happened to him?

417
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:17,875
He became so powerful...

418
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:22,121
the only thing
he was afraid of was...

419
00:44:22,222 --> 00:44:24,122
losing his power.

420
00:44:24,224 --> 00:44:27,682
Which eventually,
of course, he did.

421
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,817
Is it possible
to learn this power?

422
00:44:36,664 --> 00:44:38,791
Not from a Jedi.

423
00:44:55,683 --> 00:44:57,583
All Red units, over here!

424
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:12,462
Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau?

425
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:15,627
A partial message was intercepted
in a diplomatic packet...

426
00:45:15,737 --> 00:45:18,865
- from the chairman of Utapau.
- Hmm.

427
00:45:18,973 --> 00:45:21,703
Act on this we must.

428
00:45:21,809 --> 00:45:26,542
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

429
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:30,481
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.

430
00:45:30,585 --> 00:45:35,613
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

431
00:45:35,723 --> 00:45:39,056
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

432
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,128
not the chancellor.

433
00:45:41,229 --> 00:45:46,166
A master is needed,
with more experience.

434
00:45:46,267 --> 00:45:50,761
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.

435
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:53,238
- I agree.
- Aye.

436
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,241
Aye.

437
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:59,040
Very well. Council adjourned.

438
00:46:04,752 --> 00:46:07,846
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

439
00:46:07,955 --> 00:46:13,416
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:23,302
Charge!

441
00:46:38,052 --> 00:46:39,952
Head for cover!

442
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:58,236
- You're gonna need me on this one, Master.
- Oh, I agree.

443
00:46:58,339 --> 00:47:02,435
- However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.
- Master.

444
00:47:04,378 --> 00:47:09,714
I've disappointed you. Uh, I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

445
00:47:09,817 --> 00:47:14,220
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

446
00:47:14,321 --> 00:47:16,687
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

447
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:23,725
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

448
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:26,459
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

449
00:47:26,567 --> 00:47:28,660
I have taught you
everything I know.

450
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:32,500
And you have become a far greater Jedi
than I could ever hope to be.

451
00:47:32,606 --> 00:47:35,302
But be patient, Anakin.

452
00:47:35,409 --> 00:47:39,345
It will not be long before the council
makes you a Jedi master.

453
00:47:46,754 --> 00:47:50,019
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

454
00:47:50,124 --> 00:47:52,991
Good-bye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

455
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:20,178
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

456
00:48:20,287 --> 00:48:24,348
- On the far side.
- I'll keep them distracted until you get there.

457
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:52,055
Save your energy.

458
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:54,182
I can't.

459
00:48:54,293 --> 00:48:56,056
Don't give up, Padmé.

460
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:11,809
Obi-Wan's been here,
hasn't he?

461
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:13,936
He came by this morning.

462
00:49:15,347 --> 00:49:17,247
What did he want?

463
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:19,283
He's worried about you.

464
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:25,723
He says you've been under a lot of stress.

465
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:28,589
I feel lost.

466
00:49:29,728 --> 00:49:32,856
Lost? What do you mean?

467
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,166
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

468
00:49:37,269 --> 00:49:40,670
They trust you
with their lives.

469
00:49:42,441 --> 00:49:44,500
Something's happening.

470
00:49:49,676 --> 00:49:51,644
You expect too much
of yourself.

471
00:49:55,614 --> 00:49:58,811
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

472
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:00,851
From my nightmares.

473
00:50:00,953 --> 00:50:02,887
Is that what's
bothering you?

474
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:06,584
I won't lose you, Padmé.

475
00:50:06,692 --> 00:50:08,785
I'm not gonna die
in childbirth, Ani.

476
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,812
Greetings, young Jedi.

477
00:50:51,914 --> 00:50:55,350
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

478
00:50:55,451 --> 00:50:57,385
Unfortunately, the war.

479
00:50:57,486 --> 00:51:02,048
There's no war here...
unless you brought it with you.

480
00:51:02,158 --> 00:51:05,355
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

481
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:11,297
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

482
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:22,673
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

483
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:25,679
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

484
00:51:25,781 --> 00:51:30,582
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

485
00:51:30,686 --> 00:51:33,154
Tell your people
to take shelter.

486
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:36,224
If you have warriors,
now is the time.

487
00:51:47,136 --> 00:51:51,334
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

488
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:57,370
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

489
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:44,955
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

490
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:52,762
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the Outer Rim.

491
00:53:00,276 --> 00:53:02,608
It is a volcanic planet.

492
00:53:02,711 --> 00:53:06,010
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

493
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:10,108
Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine
managed to escape your grip, General.

494
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:14,656
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

495
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:17,692
Be thankful, Viceroy...

496
00:53:17,793 --> 00:53:20,694
you have not
found yourself in my grip.

497
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,658
Your ship is waiting.

498
00:53:43,786 --> 00:53:45,947
Hello there.

499
00:53:47,923 --> 00:53:53,190
General Kenobi.

500
00:53:53,295 --> 00:53:55,820
You are a bold one.

501
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:59,332
Kill him.

502
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:17,311
Back away.

503
00:54:17,419 --> 00:54:21,355
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

504
00:54:21,457 --> 00:54:23,652
Your move.

505
00:54:23,759 --> 00:54:25,659
You fool.

506
00:54:25,761 --> 00:54:31,358
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

507
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,374
Attack, Kenobi.

508
00:55:56,752 --> 00:55:59,084
Army or not...

509
00:55:59,188 --> 00:56:04,285
you must realize
you are doomed.

510
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:06,361
Oh, I don't think so.

511
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:37,549
Uh-oh.

512
00:56:41,211 --> 00:56:43,179
Hyah!

513
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:04,128
Cover that corner.

514
00:57:09,787 --> 00:57:11,846
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

515
00:57:11,956 --> 00:57:14,720
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

516
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:17,090
and we have begun our attack.

517
00:57:17,195 --> 00:57:19,595
Thank you, Commander.

518
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:22,860
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

519
00:57:22,967 --> 00:57:25,527
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

520
00:57:25,637 --> 00:57:27,730
Yes, Master.

521
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:37,811
I sense a plot
to destroy the Jedi.

522
00:57:37,916 --> 00:57:40,544
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

523
00:57:40,652 --> 00:57:44,986
If he does not give up his emergency powers
after the destruction of Grievous...

524
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,649
then he should be removed
from office.

525
00:57:47,759 --> 00:57:51,422
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

526
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:53,656
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

527
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:58,225
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

528
00:57:58,336 --> 00:58:03,468
Hmm. Great care
we must take.

529
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:33,279
Aaah!

530
01:00:06,028 --> 01:00:07,928
So uncivilized.

531
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,409
Chancellor.

532
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:23,042
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

533
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:25,815
He has engaged
General Grievous.

534
01:00:25,923 --> 01:00:29,256
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

535
01:00:31,121 --> 01:00:33,089
I should be there with him.

536
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,556
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

537
01:00:35,659 --> 01:00:38,924
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

538
01:00:39,029 --> 01:00:43,125
Don't you wonder
why they won't make you a Jedi master?

539
01:00:44,835 --> 01:00:46,803
I wish I knew.

540
01:00:48,138 --> 01:00:50,629
More and more I get
the feeling that...

541
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:52,971
I'm being excluded
from the council.

542
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:03,885
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

543
01:01:06,156 --> 01:01:08,556
They don't trust you, Anakin.

544
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:11,320
They see your future.

545
01:01:11,428 --> 01:01:16,388
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

546
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:22,234
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

547
01:01:23,573 --> 01:01:27,703
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

548
01:01:27,811 --> 01:01:30,575
How do you know the ways of the Force?

549
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:35,344
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

550
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:38,421
Even the nature of
the dark side.

551
01:01:40,424 --> 01:01:42,756
You know the dark side?

552
01:01:42,859 --> 01:01:45,293
Anakin...

553
01:01:45,395 --> 01:01:48,694
if one is to understand
the great mystery...

554
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,359
one must study
all its aspects...

555
01:01:51,468 --> 01:01:54,437
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

556
01:01:54,538 --> 01:01:58,338
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

557
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:02,105
you must embrace a larger view
of the Force.

558
01:02:02,212 --> 01:02:04,806
Be careful of the Jedi,
Anakin.

559
01:02:04,915 --> 01:02:07,110
Only through me...

560
01:02:07,217 --> 01:02:11,085
can you achieve a power
greater than any Jedi.

561
01:02:11,188 --> 01:02:14,487
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

562
01:02:14,591 --> 01:02:18,254
and you will be able to
save your wife...

563
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:20,386
from certain death.

564
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:23,431
What did you say?

565
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:27,162
Use my knowledge.
I beg you.

566
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:31,033
You're the Sith lord.

567
01:02:31,141 --> 01:02:35,009
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

568
01:02:35,111 --> 01:02:39,673
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

569
01:02:41,818 --> 01:02:45,276
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

570
01:02:45,388 --> 01:02:47,948
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

571
01:02:48,058 --> 01:02:50,424
A life of significance...

572
01:02:50,527 --> 01:02:52,893
of conscience.

573
01:02:57,067 --> 01:03:01,299
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

574
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:04,805
I know you would.

575
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:08,708
I can feel your anger.

576
01:03:08,812 --> 01:03:11,508
It gives you focus...

577
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:13,947
makes you stronger.

578
01:03:20,223 --> 01:03:24,353
- I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.
- Of course. You should.

579
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:27,487
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

580
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:31,124
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

581
01:03:31,234 --> 01:03:33,668
You have great wisdom,
Anakin.

582
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:37,399
Know the power
of the dark side.

583
01:03:37,507 --> 01:03:40,271
Power to save Padmé.

584
01:03:41,116 --> 01:03:43,141
Master Windu, I must talk to you.

585
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:47,313
Skywalker, we just received word
that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

586
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:51,359
We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.

587
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,191
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

588
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:58,391
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

589
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,468
A Sith lord?

590
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:03,402
Yes. The one we've been
looking for.

591
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:07,464
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

592
01:04:07,576 --> 01:04:09,703
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

593
01:04:09,812 --> 01:04:12,610
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

594
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,313
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

595
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:19,876
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

596
01:04:19,988 --> 01:04:22,422
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

597
01:04:22,524 --> 01:04:24,822
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

598
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,862
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

599
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:30,727
I sense a great deal of confusion in you,
young Skywalker.

600
01:04:30,833 --> 01:04:32,994
There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.

601
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:35,263
- I must go, Master.
- No.

602
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:39,240
If what you've
told me is true...

603
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:41,241
you will have
gained my trust.

604
01:04:41,343 --> 01:04:43,868
But for now, remain here.

605
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,912
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

606
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,446
Yes, Master.

607
01:05:21,216 --> 01:05:23,810
You do know, don't you...

608
01:05:23,919 --> 01:05:26,285
if the Jedi destroy me...

609
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:30,347
any chance of saving her
will be lost.

610
01:06:49,864 --> 01:06:54,301
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

611
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:57,667
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

612
01:06:58,778 --> 01:07:00,712
You're under arrest,
Chancellor.

613
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:03,407
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

614
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:05,450
The senate will decide
your fate.

615
01:07:05,551 --> 01:07:08,585
- I am the senate.

616
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,527
You are under arrest,
my lord.

617
01:08:28,869 --> 01:08:31,429
Anakin, I told you
it would come to this.

618
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,166
I was right.

619
01:08:33,274 --> 01:08:35,435
The Jedi are taking over.

620
01:08:35,543 --> 01:08:38,011
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

621
01:08:38,113 --> 01:08:39,912
You have lost.

622
01:08:39,912 --> 01:08:43,507
No. No.
You will die!

623
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:48,178
He's a traitor!

624
01:08:48,287 --> 01:08:51,552
He is the traitor!

625
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:57,786
I have the power
to save the one you love.

626
01:08:57,897 --> 01:09:00,695
You must choose.

627
01:09:01,801 --> 01:09:04,361
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

628
01:09:05,471 --> 01:09:08,065
Don't let him kill me.

629
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:13,906
I can't hold it any longer.

630
01:09:14,013 --> 01:09:17,380
I...I...I...I can't.
I...I...I'm weak.

631
01:09:17,483 --> 01:09:19,451
I'm...I'm too weak.

632
01:09:19,552 --> 01:09:20,985
Anakin.

633
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,555
Help me. Help me!

634
01:09:26,525 --> 01:09:30,052
I...I...I can't
hold on any longer.

635
01:09:30,162 --> 01:09:33,290
I am going to end this
once and for all.

636
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,367
You can't.

637
01:09:35,468 --> 01:09:37,402
He must stand trial.

638
01:09:37,503 --> 01:09:40,904
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

639
01:09:41,007 --> 01:09:43,237
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

640
01:09:43,342 --> 01:09:47,301
I'm too weak.
Oh. Don't kill me. Please.

641
01:09:47,413 --> 01:09:49,313
It's not the Jedi way.

642
01:09:49,415 --> 01:09:50,939
He must live.

643
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:54,710
Please don't.

644
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,950
I need him.

645
01:09:57,056 --> 01:09:59,286
- Please don't!
- No!

646
01:10:04,327 --> 01:10:07,052
Power!

647
01:10:11,767 --> 01:10:17,205
Unlimited power!

648
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:40,295
You're fulfilling
your destiny, Anakin.

649
01:10:40,405 --> 01:10:43,135
Become my apprentice.

650
01:10:43,242 --> 01:10:48,680
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

651
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:54,319
I will do
whatever you ask.

652
01:10:55,754 --> 01:10:58,917
Good.

653
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:03,220
Just help me save
Padmé's life.

654
01:11:05,197 --> 01:11:07,563
I can't live without her.

655
01:11:10,736 --> 01:11:15,139
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

656
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,438
but if we work together...

657
01:11:19,545 --> 01:11:23,345
I know we can discover
the secret.

658
01:11:24,783 --> 01:11:27,081
I pledge myself...

659
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:31,513
to your teachings.

660
01:11:31,623 --> 01:11:33,648
Good.

661
01:11:33,759 --> 01:11:36,319
Good.

662
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:49,040
The Force is strong
with you.

663
01:11:49,141 --> 01:11:54,704
A powerful Sith
you will become.

664
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:59,079
Henceforth
you shall be known as...

665
01:11:59,184 --> 01:12:01,812
Darth...

666
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,888
Vader.

667
01:12:08,026 --> 01:12:11,052
Thank you, my master.

668
01:12:13,265 --> 01:12:15,233
Rise.

669
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:33,317
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

670
01:12:34,887 --> 01:12:39,654
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

671
01:12:40,993 --> 01:12:43,723
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

672
01:12:43,829 --> 01:12:45,797
they will kill us...

673
01:12:45,898 --> 01:12:48,526
along with all the senators.

674
01:12:48,634 --> 01:12:50,602
I agree.

675
01:12:50,702 --> 01:12:54,297
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

676
01:12:54,406 --> 01:12:57,398
Every single Jedi...

677
01:12:57,509 --> 01:13:00,774
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

678
01:13:00,879 --> 01:13:04,440
is now an enemy
of the Republic.

679
01:13:05,484 --> 01:13:07,452
I understand, Master.

680
01:13:07,552 --> 01:13:10,146
We must move quickly.

681
01:13:10,255 --> 01:13:12,223
The Jedi are relentless.

682
01:13:12,324 --> 01:13:18,126
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

683
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:23,597
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

684
01:13:24,703 --> 01:13:27,806
We will catch them
off-balance.

685
01:13:27,806 --> 01:13:31,765
Do what must be done,
Lord Vader.

686
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:35,870
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

687
01:13:35,981 --> 01:13:40,748
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

688
01:13:40,852 --> 01:13:43,878
to save Padmé.

689
01:13:43,989 --> 01:13:47,857
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

690
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,020
Their betrayal
will be dealt with.

691
01:13:52,931 --> 01:13:56,230
After you have killed all the Jedi
in the temple...

692
01:13:56,335 --> 01:13:59,031
go to the Mustafar system.

693
01:13:59,137 --> 01:14:02,402
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

694
01:14:02,507 --> 01:14:05,943
and the other
separatist leaders.

695
01:14:06,044 --> 01:14:11,949
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

696
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:15,085
And...

697
01:14:15,187 --> 01:14:19,954
we shall have... peace.

698
01:15:03,301 --> 01:15:06,134
Sergeant, over here!

699
01:15:06,238 --> 01:15:08,172
Hurry! Follow them!

700
01:15:10,275 --> 01:15:12,835
All Red units,
let's move it!

701
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:14,844
Come on. Let's go!

702
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:30,718
Commander, contact
your troops.

703
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:32,797
Tell them to move to
the higher levels.

704
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:34,798
Very good, sir.

705
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,027
Oh, by the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

706
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:40,696
Thank you, Cody. Now let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win here.

707
01:15:40,806 --> 01:15:42,706
- Hyah!
- Yes, sir.

708
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:51,540
Commander Cody...

709
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:54,983
the time has come.

710
01:15:55,087 --> 01:15:59,319
Execute order 66.

711
01:15:59,424 --> 01:16:01,392
Yes, my lord.

712
01:16:05,864 --> 01:16:08,389
Blast him!

713
01:16:33,325 --> 01:16:35,589
Come on!

714
01:18:44,148 --> 01:18:46,482
Master Skywalker.

715
01:18:55,488 --> 01:18:59,652
The chancellor's office indicated
Master Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

716
01:18:59,759 --> 01:19:02,819
Don't worry. I...
I'm sure he'll be all right.

717
01:19:25,954 --> 01:19:29,014
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

718
01:19:29,124 --> 01:19:31,684
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

719
01:19:31,793 --> 01:19:35,024
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

720
01:19:36,764 --> 01:19:38,732
And so it is.

721
01:19:43,211 --> 01:19:45,873
Get him!

722
01:19:51,982 --> 01:19:53,847
No!

723
01:19:57,487 --> 01:20:00,012
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

724
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:29,885
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

725
01:20:29,986 --> 01:20:31,954
Yes, sir.

726
01:20:39,563 --> 01:20:41,463
Good-bye, Tarfful.

727
01:20:41,565 --> 01:20:43,533
Good-bye, Chewbacca.

728
01:20:45,368 --> 01:20:48,269
Miss you I will.

729
01:21:25,275 --> 01:21:27,573
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

730
01:21:27,677 --> 01:21:30,043
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

731
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:37,653
Did you find Kenobi?

732
01:21:37,754 --> 01:21:39,745
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

733
01:21:39,856 --> 01:21:43,155
Start loading your men on the ships.

734
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:46,024
Move it.

735
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:20,052
Emergency code 913.

736
01:22:20,163 --> 01:22:22,063
I have no contact
on any frequency.

737
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:26,227
Master Kenobi.

738
01:22:26,336 --> 01:22:28,327
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

739
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:32,340
Senator Organa.
My clone troops turned on me. I need help.

740
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:35,036
We have just rescued
Master Yoda.

741
01:22:35,145 --> 01:22:37,477
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

742
01:22:37,581 --> 01:22:39,708
We're sending you
our coordinates.

743
01:22:46,423 --> 01:22:49,358
Hush! Not so loud.

744
01:22:49,459 --> 01:22:52,485
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

745
01:22:52,596 --> 01:22:55,064
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

746
01:22:55,165 --> 01:22:58,692
- I came to see if you and the baby are safe.
- What's happening?

747
01:22:58,802 --> 01:23:01,669
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

748
01:23:01,771 --> 01:23:04,331
I can't believe that.

749
01:23:04,441 --> 01:23:09,003
I saw Master Windu attempt
to assassinate the chancellor myself.

750
01:23:09,112 --> 01:23:12,570
Oh, Anakin.
What are you gonna do?

751
01:23:21,257 --> 01:23:23,452
I will not betray
the Republic.

752
01:23:25,462 --> 01:23:28,431
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

753
01:23:28,531 --> 01:23:31,261
and with the senate
and with you.

754
01:23:31,368 --> 01:23:33,563
What about Obi-Wan?

755
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:35,900
I don't know.

756
01:23:36,006 --> 01:23:38,099
Many Jedi
have been killed.

757
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:42,008
We can only hope
that he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

758
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,478
Anakin, I'm afraid.

759
01:23:46,416 --> 01:23:49,544
Have faith, my love.

760
01:23:49,653 --> 01:23:51,951
Everything will soon
be set right.

761
01:23:52,055 --> 01:23:55,456
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

762
01:23:55,558 --> 01:23:58,755
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

763
01:23:58,862 --> 01:24:01,387
I'm going there
to end this war.

764
01:24:01,498 --> 01:24:03,398
Wait for me until I return.

765
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:05,866
Things will be different.
I promise.

766
01:24:11,708 --> 01:24:13,676
Please, wait for me.

767
01:24:17,747 --> 01:24:20,477
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

768
01:24:22,719 --> 01:24:24,619
Take care,
my little friend.

769
01:24:28,925 --> 01:24:32,622
Oh, my lady, is there
anything I might do?

770
01:24:32,729 --> 01:24:35,254
No, thank you, 3PO.

771
01:24:35,365 --> 01:24:40,064
Oh. I...
I feel so helpless.

772
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:06,259
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

773
01:25:06,362 --> 01:25:09,695
Heard from no one
have we.

774
01:25:09,799 --> 01:25:12,893
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

775
01:25:13,002 --> 01:25:14,902
That's why I went
looking for Yoda.

776
01:25:15,004 --> 01:25:17,564
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

777
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:20,541
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

778
01:25:20,643 --> 01:25:24,670
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

779
01:25:24,781 --> 01:25:28,217
- It says the war is over.
- Well, then we must go back.

780
01:25:28,318 --> 01:25:31,810
If there are any stragglers,
they will fall into the trap and be killed.

781
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:36,756
Hmm. Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

782
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:39,590
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

783
01:25:39,696 --> 01:25:42,256
I agree.

784
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:45,960
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

785
01:25:51,648 --> 01:25:54,776
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

786
01:25:54,885 --> 01:25:56,853
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

787
01:25:58,027 --> 01:26:02,726
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

788
01:26:02,832 --> 01:26:04,800
at a special session
of Congress.

789
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:08,428
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

790
01:26:11,441 --> 01:26:14,740
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

791
01:26:14,844 --> 01:26:17,938
The chancellor will not be able
to control the thousands of star systems...

792
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,947
without keeping
the senate intact.

793
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:24,110
If a special session
of Congress there is...

794
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:27,519
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

795
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:58,715
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

796
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,580
You have done well,
Viceroy.

797
01:27:01,686 --> 01:27:07,522
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

798
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:11,117
he will take care of you.

799
01:27:45,076 --> 01:27:47,044
R2, stay with the ship.

800
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:15,501
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

801
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:33,147
Stop! No!

802
01:28:45,907 --> 01:28:48,102
The war is over.

803
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:52,306
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want...

804
01:29:37,762 --> 01:29:42,256
And the Jedi rebellion has been foiled.

805
01:29:42,366 --> 01:29:44,664
- What's happened?
- The chancellor's been elaborating...

806
01:29:44,769 --> 01:29:48,068
on a plot by the Jedi
to overthrow the senate.

807
01:29:48,172 --> 01:29:53,633
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

808
01:30:01,820 --> 01:30:05,017
The attempt on my life...

809
01:30:05,123 --> 01:30:07,751
has left me scarred...

810
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,851
and deformed.

811
01:30:10,962 --> 01:30:13,863
But I assure you.

812
01:30:13,965 --> 01:30:18,664
My resolve
has never been stronger!

813
01:30:21,942 --> 01:30:25,605
In order to ensure
the security...

814
01:30:25,712 --> 01:30:28,272
and continuing stability...

815
01:30:28,382 --> 01:30:32,284
the Republic
will be reorganized...

816
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:37,824
into the first
Galactic Empire!

817
01:30:37,924 --> 01:30:39,949
For a safe...

818
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:44,588
and secure society.

819
01:31:22,693 --> 01:31:25,127
Not even the younglings
survived.

820
01:31:26,263 --> 01:31:28,197
Killed not by clones...

821
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:31,530
this Padawan.

822
01:31:32,636 --> 01:31:35,264
By a lightsaber he was.

823
01:31:41,946 --> 01:31:45,507
Who? Who could have
done this?

824
01:31:47,272 --> 01:31:51,971
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

825
01:31:52,077 --> 01:31:54,511
For the clones...

826
01:31:54,613 --> 01:31:58,709
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

827
01:32:11,063 --> 01:32:13,122
Wait. Master.

828
01:32:13,232 --> 01:32:16,395
There is something
I must know.

829
01:32:22,507 --> 01:32:24,975
If into the security
recordings you go...

830
01:32:25,077 --> 01:32:26,977
only pain will you find.

831
01:32:27,079 --> 01:32:30,515
I must know
the truth, Master.

832
01:32:37,422 --> 01:32:39,356
It can't be.

833
01:32:39,458 --> 01:32:41,358
It can't be.

834
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,521
You have done well,
my new apprentice.

835
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:48,623
Now, Lord Vader...

836
01:32:48,734 --> 01:32:52,261
go and bring peace
to the Empire.

837
01:32:52,371 --> 01:32:54,532
I can't watch any more.

838
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:59,202
Destroy the Sith we must.

839
01:33:01,013 --> 01:33:03,106
Send me to kill
the emperor.

840
01:33:03,215 --> 01:33:05,513
I will not kill Anakin.

841
01:33:05,617 --> 01:33:10,350
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

842
01:33:10,455 --> 01:33:13,686
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

843
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:19,526
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

844
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:23,032
The boy you trained,
gone he is.

845
01:33:23,135 --> 01:33:26,036
Consumed by Darth Vader.

846
01:33:26,138 --> 01:33:29,130
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

847
01:33:29,241 --> 01:33:31,471
I don't know where to look.

848
01:33:32,778 --> 01:33:36,475
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

849
01:33:47,025 --> 01:33:49,619
When was the last time
you saw him?

850
01:33:49,728 --> 01:33:53,095
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

851
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:56,167
No.

852
01:33:56,268 --> 01:33:59,863
Padmé, I need your help.

853
01:33:59,971 --> 01:34:02,963
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

854
01:34:03,075 --> 01:34:05,043
From himself.

855
01:34:07,479 --> 01:34:09,572
Padmé...

856
01:34:09,681 --> 01:34:12,081
Anakin has turned
to the dark side.

857
01:34:12,184 --> 01:34:15,620
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

858
01:34:18,423 --> 01:34:22,257
I have seen a...
a security hologram...

859
01:34:22,361 --> 01:34:24,795
of him...

860
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:26,796
killing younglings.

861
01:34:26,898 --> 01:34:29,924
Not Anakin.
He couldn't.

862
01:34:30,035 --> 01:34:33,004
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

863
01:34:33,105 --> 01:34:37,599
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

864
01:34:39,444 --> 01:34:42,174
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

865
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,376
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

866
01:34:52,591 --> 01:34:54,559
I don't believe you.

867
01:34:55,961 --> 01:34:57,929
I can't.

868
01:35:03,034 --> 01:35:05,525
Padmé...

869
01:35:05,637 --> 01:35:07,901
I must find him.

870
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:12,374
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

871
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:19,813
I can't.

872
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:34,959
Anakin is the father,
isn't he?

873
01:35:38,764 --> 01:35:41,597
I'm so sorry.

874
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:52,081
There's no danger.
The fighting's over. And this is personal.

875
01:35:52,186 --> 01:35:54,586
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

876
01:35:54,689 --> 01:35:58,352
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

877
01:35:58,459 --> 01:36:00,825
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

878
01:36:02,697 --> 01:36:04,665
Oh, dear.

879
01:36:15,309 --> 01:36:17,402
Do you know?

880
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:21,106
I think I'm beginning to get
the hang of this flying business. Hmm.

881
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:46,126
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

882
01:36:46,227 --> 01:36:49,128
It is finished then.

883
01:36:50,531 --> 01:36:56,333
You have restored
peace and justice to the galaxy.

884
01:36:56,437 --> 01:37:01,340
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

885
01:37:01,442 --> 01:37:06,607
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

886
01:37:06,714 --> 01:37:08,773
Very good, my lord.

887
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:24,513
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

888
01:37:24,624 --> 01:37:29,084
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

889
01:37:29,195 --> 01:37:31,425
Master Yoda.

890
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:33,590
You survived.

891
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:36,430
Surprised?

892
01:37:36,536 --> 01:37:41,132
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

893
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,299
Now you will experience...

894
01:37:43,409 --> 01:37:47,869
the full power
of the dark side.

895
01:38:00,572 --> 01:38:04,269
I have waited a long time...

896
01:38:04,376 --> 01:38:06,936
for this moment...

897
01:38:07,045 --> 01:38:11,573
my little green friend.

898
01:38:20,626 --> 01:38:25,256
At last the Jedi are no more.

899
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:29,596
Not if anything to say about it I have.

900
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:31,032
Aaah!

901
01:38:34,206 --> 01:38:37,266
At an end your rule is.

902
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:41,578
And not short enough it was.

903
01:38:45,517 --> 01:38:48,543
If so powerful you are...

904
01:38:49,822 --> 01:38:52,120
why leave?

905
01:38:52,224 --> 01:38:54,784
You will not stop me.

906
01:38:54,893 --> 01:38:59,489
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

907
01:38:59,598 --> 01:39:03,967
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

908
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:09,331
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

909
01:41:37,676 --> 01:41:40,406
Hurry. Careful timing
we will need.

910
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:43,310
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

911
01:41:43,415 --> 01:41:45,781
There's no sign
of his body, sir.

912
01:41:45,884 --> 01:41:49,547
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

913
01:41:49,655 --> 01:41:51,885
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.

914
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:57,087
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate takeoff.

915
01:41:57,196 --> 01:42:02,259
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

916
01:42:22,163 --> 01:42:25,929
Into exile I must go.

917
01:42:26,033 --> 01:42:28,126
Failed I have.

918
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:30,828
I saw your ship.

919
01:43:33,674 --> 01:43:36,666
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

920
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:41,012
Obi-Wan told me
terrible things.

921
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:43,241
What things?

922
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:46,285
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

923
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:48,786
That you...

924
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:51,016
killed younglings.

925
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:55,255
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

926
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:59,128
- He cares about us.
- Us?

927
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,962
He knows.

928
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:03,969
He wants to help you.

929
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:11,067
Anakin, all I want
is your love.

930
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:13,510
Love won't save you, Padmé.

931
01:44:13,613 --> 01:44:16,878
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

932
01:44:16,984 --> 01:44:19,384
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

933
01:44:19,486 --> 01:44:22,216
I won't lose you the way
I lost my mother.

934
01:44:22,322 --> 01:44:26,554
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

935
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:29,458
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

936
01:44:30,764 --> 01:44:32,732
Come away with me.

937
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:35,495
Help me raise our child.

938
01:44:35,602 --> 01:44:39,834
- Leave everything else behind while we still can.
- Don't you see?

939
01:44:39,940 --> 01:44:43,171
We don't have to
run away anymore.

940
01:44:43,276 --> 01:44:45,801
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

941
01:44:45,912 --> 01:44:48,779
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

942
01:44:48,882 --> 01:44:50,975
I...I can overthrow him.

943
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:56,113
And together, you and I
can rule the galaxy...

944
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:58,623
make things the way
we want them to be.

945
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:06,956
I don't believe
what I'm hearing.

946
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:11,767
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

947
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:16,841
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

948
01:45:16,943 --> 01:45:21,107
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

949
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:24,807
I don't know you anymore.

950
01:45:26,453 --> 01:45:28,421
Anakin...

951
01:45:28,522 --> 01:45:31,116
you're breaking my heart.

952
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:34,704
Because of Obi-Wan?

953
01:45:34,809 --> 01:45:37,607
Because of what you've done.

954
01:45:37,712 --> 01:45:39,612
What you plan to do.

955
01:45:40,103 --> 01:45:42,765
Stop. Stop now.
Come back.

956
01:45:42,872 --> 01:45:45,807
- I love you.
- Liar!

957
01:45:48,678 --> 01:45:50,543
No.

958
01:45:50,647 --> 01:45:54,378
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

959
01:45:54,484 --> 01:45:57,419
- No.
- Let her go, Anakin.

960
01:45:58,989 --> 01:46:00,547
Anakin.

961
01:46:00,657 --> 01:46:02,818
Let her go.

962
01:46:12,802 --> 01:46:14,827
You turned her against me!

963
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:18,634
You have done that yourself.

964
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:25,575
You will not
take her from me!

965
01:46:25,682 --> 01:46:29,516
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

966
01:46:32,689 --> 01:46:37,820
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind, until now-

967
01:46:39,396 --> 01:46:42,559
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

968
01:46:42,665 --> 01:46:44,599
Don't lecture me,
Obi-Wan.

969
01:46:44,701 --> 01:46:47,192
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

970
01:46:48,304 --> 01:46:50,704
I do not fear the dark side
as you do.

971
01:46:52,542 --> 01:46:54,476
I have brought peace...

972
01:46:54,577 --> 01:46:56,272
freedom, justice...

973
01:46:56,379 --> 01:46:58,413
and security.

974
01:47:01,606 --> 01:47:04,939
Don't make me kill you.

975
01:47:05,044 --> 01:47:09,538
Anakin, my allegiance
is to the Republic, to democracy!

976
01:47:09,648 --> 01:47:12,242
If you're not with me...

977
01:47:13,285 --> 01:47:15,185
then you're my enemy.

978
01:47:17,189 --> 01:47:19,680
Only a Sith
deals in absolutes.

979
01:47:22,294 --> 01:47:24,694
I will do what I must.

980
01:47:24,797 --> 01:47:27,197
You will try.

981
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:27,615
I have failed you, Anakin.

982
01:52:27,715 --> 01:52:29,615
I have failed you.

983
01:52:29,717 --> 01:52:32,618
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

984
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,518
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

985
01:52:35,623 --> 01:52:38,285
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

986
01:52:38,393 --> 01:52:39,951
Well, then you are lost!

987
01:52:51,839 --> 01:52:54,364
This is the end for you,
my master.

988
01:53:35,655 --> 01:53:38,419
You were the chosen one!

989
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:42,386
It was said that you would
destroy the Sith, not join them!

990
01:53:45,027 --> 01:53:47,086
Bring balance
to the Force...

991
01:53:47,196 --> 01:53:49,721
not leave it in darkness!

992
01:54:07,103 --> 01:54:09,367
You were my brother, Anakin.

993
01:55:15,629 --> 01:55:18,427
Your Majesty, this way.

994
01:55:18,531 --> 01:55:20,431
There he is.

995
01:55:20,533 --> 01:55:22,694
He's still alive.

996
01:55:25,705 --> 01:55:27,935
Get a medical capsule
immediately.

997
01:55:28,041 --> 01:55:30,009
Yes, sir. Right away.

998
01:55:57,896 --> 01:55:59,864
Oh. Master Kenobi.

999
01:55:59,965 --> 01:56:02,229
Um, we have
Miss Padmé on board.

1000
01:56:02,334 --> 01:56:04,859
Yes. Please,
please hurry.

1001
01:56:04,970 --> 01:56:07,131
We should leave
this dreadful place.

1002
01:57:39,546 --> 01:57:41,946
We'll take her to the medical center.
Quickly.

1003
01:57:48,736 --> 01:57:51,899
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1004
01:57:52,006 --> 01:57:53,598
Babies?

1005
01:57:53,708 --> 01:57:55,573
She's carrying twins.

1006
01:59:01,393 --> 01:59:04,089
Lord Vader.

1007
01:59:04,196 --> 01:59:06,289
Can you hear me?

1008
01:59:09,335 --> 01:59:11,803
Yes, Master.

1009
01:59:13,724 --> 01:59:16,386
Is she safe?

1010
01:59:16,894 --> 01:59:18,885
Is she all right?

1011
01:59:20,631 --> 01:59:25,159
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1012
01:59:26,203 --> 01:59:29,104
I... I couldn't have.

1013
01:59:29,206 --> 01:59:32,198
She was alive.
I felt it!

1014
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:15,710
Hidden, safe
the children must be kept.

1015
02:01:15,818 --> 02:01:20,050
We must take them somewhere
where the Sith will not sense their presence.

1016
02:01:21,156 --> 02:01:25,092
Hmm. Split up
they should be.

1017
02:01:25,194 --> 02:01:27,321
My wife and I
will take the girl.

1018
02:01:28,897 --> 02:01:31,832
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1019
02:01:31,934 --> 02:01:34,164
She will be loved with us.

1020
02:01:34,269 --> 02:01:37,067
And what of the boy?

1021
02:01:37,172 --> 02:01:41,506
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1022
02:01:43,345 --> 02:01:45,779
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1023
02:01:50,486 --> 02:01:54,923
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1024
02:01:56,725 --> 02:02:00,320
Master Kenobi,
wait a moment.

1025
02:02:01,864 --> 02:02:07,063
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1026
02:02:07,169 --> 02:02:09,729
Training?

1027
02:02:09,838 --> 02:02:14,400
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1028
02:02:16,478 --> 02:02:19,572
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1029
02:02:19,681 --> 02:02:22,172
Your old master.

1030
02:02:22,284 --> 02:02:24,275
Qui-Gon?

1031
02:02:26,788 --> 02:02:30,053
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1032
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:33,721
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1033
02:02:33,829 --> 02:02:35,729
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1034
02:02:35,831 --> 02:02:37,731
Treat them well.
Clean them up.

1035
02:02:37,833 --> 02:02:39,733
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1036
02:02:39,835 --> 02:02:41,302
What?

1037
02:02:43,172 --> 02:02:44,940
Oh, no.

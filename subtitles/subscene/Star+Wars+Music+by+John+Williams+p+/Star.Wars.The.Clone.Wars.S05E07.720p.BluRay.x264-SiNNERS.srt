1
00:00:17,919 --> 00:00:20,121
<i>Ancient Jedi tradition!</i>

2
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,624
<i>Six younglings are sent
to the secret caverns of Ilum,</i>

3
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,592
<i>where they are tested
by The Gathering,</i>

4
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:27,227
<i>an ancient Jedi ritual</i>

5
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>where each youngling
must harvest a crystal,</i>

6
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:32,765
<i>around which they will construct
their own lightsaber.</i>

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,536
<i>Along the journey,
they underwent great perils,</i>

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,039
<i>hardest of which
was to face themselves.</i>

9
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,274
<i>Now, having passed the test,</i>

10
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,812
<i>they take their first step
into a larger world.</i>

11
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,598
I call that move
the "Whirlwind of Destiny".

12
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,067
Showoff.

13
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:13,770
Can everyone gather around, please?

14
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:19,809
You have all successfully passed
The Gathering

15
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:21,743
and harvested your crystals.

16
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:26,581
So when do we start
to build our sabers?

17
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:28,483
Place your crystals on the table.

18
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:30,450
Your lesson begins now.

19
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:35,722
May I introduce you to architect
and lightsaber designer Huyang?

20
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,366
These are them.

21
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,703
I swear they get younger
every expedition.

22
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:53,305
All have passed The Gathering?

23
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,507
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,941
Are you sure?

25
00:01:55,975 --> 00:01:57,342
But he's a droid.

26
00:01:57,377 --> 00:02:00,045
You expect us to learn from a droid?

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,981
Who said that?

28
00:02:03,983 --> 00:02:05,617
Many years I have been on this ship,

29
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:07,252
teaching many a Jedi before you,

30
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,822
and I will continue teaching
many a Jedi after you.

31
00:02:09,856 --> 00:02:12,791
Call me what you want,
but inside my memory banks,

32
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,594
I contain a record
of every lightsaber ever made

33
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:17,128
and the Jedi who fashioned them.

34
00:02:17,163 --> 00:02:18,196
Whoa!
Look at that!

35
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,097
Which will you choose?
A simple grip?

36
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:21,831
The curved approach?

37
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:24,567
One inlaid with the bone
of the Cartusion whale,

38
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,403
pastillion ore, or black onk?

39
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:29,171
Well?

40
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:32,439
From Battles of Rashfond
to the Peacekeeping of Parliock

41
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:34,041
to our very own Clone Wars,

42
00:02:34,075 --> 00:02:37,443
the lightsaber is a Jedi's
only true ally.

43
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:38,977
But how do they work, hmm?

44
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:41,480
Yes, you have brought me crystals,

45
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:43,915
but they're all useless
unless you give them life.

46
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,885
Do you know how to awaken
the Force within the crystal?

47
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,720
No?

48
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:51,555
Then I suggest you listen and learn

49
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,459
until you think of a question
this droid cannot answer.

50
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,361
A Wookiee.

51
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:59,930
Rare you are to the Jedi.

52
00:02:59,964 --> 00:03:01,832
Proud your people must be.

53
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:05,734
Unique, just as
your lightsaber will be.

54
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,004
Hold out your hand, Wookiee.

55
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:11,906
Describe what you see
your saber to be.

56
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,444
No, no, no, not what you imagine

57
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,780
but what you feel in your hand.

58
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,181
Concentrate.

59
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:23,650
What will make you strong in battle

60
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,486
and humble in retreat?

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,655
What connects with your Force?

62
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:37,930
Ah, yes, wood.
Not a common choice.

63
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,765
And only wood from the brylark tree

64
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,066
is as strong as metal.

65
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:42,301
Let me see.

66
00:03:42,369 --> 00:03:45,270
Where would we find that
all the way out here,

67
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:49,507
far from anywhere, deep in space?

68
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:54,510
Let's see what we have.

69
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:57,046
Let me see.
Let me...

70
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:59,916
Yes, yes, yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

71
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,751
Ah, I wondered where I put that.

72
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:05,621
Oh, that's not mine.

73
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:10,125
Ah, ah, what do we have here?

74
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,697
- Whoa, look at that.
- Ooh.

75
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,666
- Ooh.
- Wow.

76
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,201
You can say that again.

77
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:22,335
Wow.

78
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,005
It is my job,
before you leave this ship,

79
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,473
you will have everything you need

80
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,907
to build your lightsabers

81
00:04:27,941 --> 00:04:30,075
and the knowledge of how to do it.

82
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,377
So let us begin.

83
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:34,113
There is much more work to be done.

84
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:48,292
Well, where are they?

85
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:51,262
The Jedi ship
is right in front of us, sir.

86
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:54,798
Lose them, and you'll lose
more than your head.

87
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:57,634
Our attack must be swift
and devastating.

88
00:04:57,669 --> 00:04:59,803
They cannot have time to get away.

89
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:05,441
I thought we weren't going
to mess with Jedi anymore.

90
00:05:05,476 --> 00:05:07,510
These aren't Jedi.

91
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:10,146
My sources say
they're just younglings,

92
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,650
headed back to the Jedi Temple
from a training mission

93
00:05:14,684 --> 00:05:17,786
with the most important treasure
in the universe...

94
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:22,256
Kiber crystals,
used for making laser swords.

95
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,894
The price for just one
would make a man rich,

96
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:31,798
and we all know how much
I like to be rich, don't we?

97
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:49,046
What's the rush, Petro?

98
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,548
With this lightsaber,

99
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:54,050
I'm going to challenge
Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel

100
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:55,685
and kill Grievous.

101
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:09,176
The only person
you are going to kill with that,

102
00:06:09,198 --> 00:06:11,165
my young friend, is yourself.

103
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,101
You have inverted the emitter matrix,

104
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:15,637
which will cause the power grid
to backfire.

105
00:06:15,672 --> 00:06:17,606
Light this, and all that will be left

106
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,940
of you and your lightsaber

107
00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,375
will be your crystal.

108
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:21,743
Start again,

109
00:06:21,777 --> 00:06:26,081
and this time,
please follow the diagram.

110
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:42,597
Remember, quiet your mind
and concentrate.

111
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:46,133
The design will become clear.

112
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:48,702
Good. Gently.

113
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:50,070
Trust the Force.

114
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,139
What was that?

115
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,374
I don't know.
Hold on.

116
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,846
R2, what's happened?

117
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,117
Where?

118
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:07,519
Oh, no.

119
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:11,669
Ugh, they're aiming for the hyperdrive.

120
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:13,043
Get us out of here!

121
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:26,054
I don't like the sound of that.

122
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,590
Stay here.
I'll check on the younglings.

123
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:34,629
Excellent shot.

124
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,764
Fire the grappling harpoons.

125
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:46,640
Now reel them in,
and let's get what we came for.

126
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:27,543
What's happening?

127
00:08:27,578 --> 00:08:29,111
We're being boarded.

128
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:30,913
Here? Why?

129
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,049
I don't know.

130
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,949
Quickly, give me your crystals,

131
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,317
and I will hold on to them
until we are safe.

132
00:09:26,496 --> 00:09:28,325
Younglings! Younglings!

133
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:30,059
Who's attacking the ship?

134
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,466
Pirates.

135
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,035
Pirates?
They'll kill us all.

136
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,306
Perhaps we should hide
in the ventilation shaft.

137
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,541
Follow me.

138
00:09:40,576 --> 00:09:42,309
Hiding is for cowards.

139
00:09:42,343 --> 00:09:43,977
We should stand and fight.

140
00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:47,381
Huh, we're gonna fight,
just not the way they expect.

141
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,351
Time to go.

142
00:09:51,385 --> 00:09:53,386
Is this part of our training?

143
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,654
It is now.

144
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,467
Shh.

145
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,396
Hondo says find the kids
and bring 'em to him.

146
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,698
Dead or alive?

147
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,033
Yes.

148
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,538
We must have courage, young Jedi.

149
00:10:21,573 --> 00:10:24,441
Ganodi and Zatt, I need you
to get to the cockpit,

150
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,709
find R2, and secure it.

151
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:29,278
The rest of you, take Professor Huyang

152
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:31,247
and seal yourselves inside the hold,

153
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,981
and wait for my command.

154
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,116
What are you going to do?

155
00:10:35,151 --> 00:10:38,019
I'm going to reroute
enough power to the engines

156
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,621
so that we can break free
of the pirate ship's hold on us.

157
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:42,089
Okay?

158
00:10:42,123 --> 00:10:45,125
Wh... what about the pirates
already on board the ship?

159
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,127
Once the docking tube is ruptured,

160
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:50,029
when the ships pull apart,
a vacuum will be created,

161
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:53,165
which will suck the pirates
off our ship and into space.

162
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,835
Will we be sucked into space?

163
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:59,738
No, the cockpit and the hold
will be sealed

164
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:01,540
and still have air.

165
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:05,743
Do not, and I mean, do not
engage the pirates.

166
00:11:05,777 --> 00:11:08,311
Your only job is to stay hidden.

167
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:10,013
Do you understand?

168
00:11:11,515 --> 00:11:12,515
Now go.

169
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,458
I smell profit!

170
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,930
Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits.

171
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,230
Well?

172
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,734
Well, we've secured the ship,
but she seems deserted.

173
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:37,269
Imbecile!

174
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:39,805
That is the oldest trick in the book.

175
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,575
The runts are probably hiding
in the ventilation system.

176
00:11:43,642 --> 00:11:45,443
Oh. Right.

177
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:46,577
Didn't think of that.

178
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,679
Why does that not surprise me?

179
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:51,848
All that matters is you find
the younglings

180
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,017
and bring me the crystals.

181
00:11:54,051 --> 00:11:57,219
If anything gets in the way, kill it.

182
00:11:57,287 --> 00:12:01,356
But, boss, they're just kids.

183
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,560
They're just kids.
When will they learn?

184
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:07,095
In case you lack motivation,

185
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:09,964
remember that on the black market,

186
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:13,001
these crystals are priceless.

187
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,771
We can't fit in there.

188
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,641
Smoke them out.

189
00:12:20,675 --> 00:12:22,842
You heard the boss.

190
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:40,026
I do love me a party.

191
00:13:01,682 --> 00:13:03,082
Hold it!

192
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,887
Get off him!

193
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,188
Easy, there.

194
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,890
That's no way to make friends,
now, is it?

195
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:19,629
Thanks, buddy.

196
00:13:22,908 --> 00:13:24,342
Come on, keep up.

197
00:13:24,376 --> 00:13:25,911
The hold is not much further.

198
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:28,680
Something's wrong.

199
00:13:43,294 --> 00:13:45,010
Unhand me, brigand!

200
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,264
Well, hello, girls and boys.

201
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:52,135
We've been looking forward
to meetin' ya.

202
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:00,081
Now, be nice,
and hand over your crystals.

203
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,705
Over my dead body.

204
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:06,041
That can be arranged.

205
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,246
Petro, no.

206
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:14,282
Your emitter matrix is still inverted.

207
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:18,119
So which one of you is first?

208
00:14:18,153 --> 00:14:20,888
All bark, no bite.

209
00:14:20,922 --> 00:14:23,758
Ah, that's for me.

210
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,461
I always wanted one of these.

211
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:28,597
You sure you can handle it?

212
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:32,867
Huh?

213
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,103
Everybody get down!

214
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:44,645
Let's go.

215
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:47,546
Hurry, hurry.
This way, younglings.

216
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,094
You could have killed him.

217
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,028
Look, we can keep running,
or we can stand and fight

218
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,598
and show these pirates
we're not afraid.

219
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,035
I cannot approve of such action.

220
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:14,404
Besides, I have been damaged
and cannot aid you in battle.

221
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:18,075
Petro's right.

222
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,243
It's our only choice:

223
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:23,113
fight or be killed.

224
00:15:32,388 --> 00:15:34,422
Zatt, <i>come in</i>.

225
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,059
<i>I am over</i> riding
the emergency power fail-safe

226
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:38,994
<i>and routing energy to the engines.</i>

227
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:40,195
It's working.

228
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,596
Any word from the others?

229
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,198
Have they reached the hold?

230
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,634
- Uh, not yet.
- <i>Where are they?</i>

231
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:49,603
I don't know.
I didn't hear from them.

232
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:52,706
Great.
I know what that means.

233
00:15:57,932 --> 00:16:00,380
Set them to the highest level.

234
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,321
Get him!

235
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:12,689
Gungi!

236
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:25,100
Here, kiddie kiddies.

237
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:28,703
You can come out now.

238
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,172
No one's gonna hurt you.

239
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,675
Zatt, close the door
to the training room.

240
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:37,476
<i>Katooni, where are you guys?</i>

241
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,312
No time to explain.
Just close the door.

242
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,646
R2, close the door!

243
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,118
Hey, what's... what's going on?

244
00:17:12,308 --> 00:17:13,708
We can't make it.

245
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,146
There are too many blocking the hold.

246
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:28,757
Well, children,
you have put up quite a fight,

247
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,926
but playtime is over.

248
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,062
Now, hand over my crystals,

249
00:17:34,097 --> 00:17:36,697
and no one gets hurt... much.

250
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,937
Hondo, the Jedi Council

251
00:17:43,972 --> 00:17:46,706
will not take kindly to this attack.

252
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,211
Ahsoka, how will they know
who is responsible

253
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:55,247
if there is no one left
to tell the tale?

254
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:58,651
You seem less hospitable
than our last meeting.

255
00:17:58,718 --> 00:18:01,519
My mood is based on profit,

256
00:18:01,554 --> 00:18:05,723
and today I am in the mood
for crystals.

257
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:07,859
You want the crystals?

258
00:18:07,893 --> 00:18:09,493
Come and get 'em.

259
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:18,067
Oh, easy, now.

260
00:18:18,101 --> 00:18:21,137
Hurry, hurry.

261
00:18:21,171 --> 00:18:22,339
What about Ahsoka?

262
00:18:22,373 --> 00:18:24,574
Trust her.
Now, get in there.

263
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,442
Oh!

264
00:18:26,476 --> 00:18:28,443
How dare you?

265
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:30,479
I've lived on this ship
a thousand years

266
00:18:30,513 --> 00:18:31,947
and never lost a fight.

267
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:33,849
I'm not about to start today.

268
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,393
You know, had I known you were here,

269
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:50,365
I would have simply asked
for the crystals directly,

270
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:52,499
and we could have avoided all of this.

271
00:18:52,533 --> 00:18:54,301
I don't want to hurt you, Hondo.

272
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,205
I know, and I appreciate that.

273
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:01,040
We're all in the hold,

274
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:03,042
but Ahsoka's still out there
fighting the pirates.

275
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,277
Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in.

276
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,679
They've made it to the hold.

277
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,214
Then what are you waiting for?

278
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,581
But what about you?

279
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,615
Do it!

280
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:38,239
What are you doing?

281
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,675
Getting you off my ship.

282
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:45,346
Oh!

283
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,647
Whoa!

284
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:53,153
Whoa, whoa, ah!

285
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,671
Whoa!

286
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,244
We're all clear.

287
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,713
Make the jump to hyperspace.

288
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:26,514
Ah, ah, ah!

289
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,660
Yes! We did it!

290
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,728
They're off the ship.

291
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,567
Oh, Professor.

292
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:49,804
Bring him here.
I'll fix him.

293
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,440
You should have seen Ahsoka.
She took them on all by herself.

294
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:56,910
Where is Padawan Tano?

295
00:20:56,944 --> 00:20:59,645
Padawan Tano, come in.

296
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,381
Ahsoka.

297
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:06,085
Ahsoka!
Ahsoka, are you there?

298
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,960
You have cost me greatly today,
young one.

299
00:21:17,995 --> 00:21:22,098
And since you lost me so much profit,

300
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:24,733
I am left with no choice.

301
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:35,510
But to turn you into profit.

302
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:38,446
Good night.

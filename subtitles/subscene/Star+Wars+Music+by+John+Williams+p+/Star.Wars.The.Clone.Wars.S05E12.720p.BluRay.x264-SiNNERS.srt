1
00:00:18,078 --> 00:00:19,145
<i>Stranded!</i>

2
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,146
<i>On a secret mission for the Republic,</i>

3
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,015
<i>Colonel Gascon
and his intrepid droid squad</i>

4
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:26,151
<i>successfully steal an encryption module</i>

5
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:27,919
<i>from a Separatist ship.</i>

6
00:00:27,954 --> 00:00:30,288
<i>During their escape, our heroes crash</i>

7
00:00:30,323 --> 00:00:32,357
<i>on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar</i>

8
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:34,993
<i>and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland</i>

9
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:37,028
<i>called The Void.</i>

10
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:39,398
<i>Now, after surviving against all odds,</i>

11
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>our heroes must find a way home</i>

12
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:43,435
<i>and deliver the encryption module</i>

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,238
<i>to crack the Separatist code
and stop an enemy attack.</i>

14
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,576
I have never been to Tatooine,

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,844
but if this place
reminds you of it, R2,

16
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,080
remind me never to go there.

17
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,052
Don't be absurd, QT.

18
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:05,087
These people aren't dangerous.

19
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,865
Most of these people are probably hiding

20
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,566
from someone or something.

21
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,635
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

22
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,370
Nobody's here by choice,

23
00:01:25,404 --> 00:01:27,238
which goes double for me.

24
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:28,639
I hope you have a plan

25
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:31,141
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

26
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,576
Of course I do, Corporal.

27
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,245
All we need is a communications uplink

28
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:37,279
and some fuel.

29
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:41,049
Thank you for the reminder, C4,

30
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,451
but I'm well aware our shuttle's
lost in The Void.

31
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:46,988
I'm talking about fuel for me.

32
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:50,057
You droids can putter along
on battery power

33
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:52,593
but I need food to survive.

34
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:55,395
My power cells are running low, too,

35
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,698
and an oil bath would be nice.

36
00:01:57,732 --> 00:02:01,201
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

37
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:03,570
Forget it, BZ.

38
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,538
We're not on vacation here.

39
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:08,542
R2, is the encryption module safe?

40
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,847
Nothing short of death or dismemberment

41
00:02:12,881 --> 00:02:15,049
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

42
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:18,218
from delivering
that module to Coruscant.

43
00:02:22,057 --> 00:02:24,291
Well, I'll be.

44
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,794
A diner.
A place of eating.

45
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,895
I'm saved.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,665
R2, you and the other 'mechs
scout the perimeter.

47
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:34,701
Find out if there
are any unfriendlies around.

48
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:40,039
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

49
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:56,154
Good day.

50
00:02:59,692 --> 00:03:04,362
I am Colonel Gascon of
the Grand Army of the Republic.

51
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:07,332
And I am here
on very important business.

52
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:16,440
I don't have much time,
so if you'll be so kind

53
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:20,545
as to fix me your daily special
and let my droid recharge.

54
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,147
No droids.

55
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:26,583
Fine.

56
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,986
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,023
We don't serve your type either.

58
00:03:32,057 --> 00:03:35,092
What type are you referring to?

59
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,062
Conduit worms.

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,736
I beg your pardon.
I am a Zilkan.

61
00:03:44,804 --> 00:03:47,572
You'll be begging for your life

62
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:49,373
if you don't beat it.

63
00:03:51,877 --> 00:03:53,879
Beat it.

64
00:03:53,913 --> 00:03:54,913
Uh-oh.

65
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:55,914
Ah!

66
00:03:55,948 --> 00:03:58,816
Oh, ah!

67
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,218
This is an outrage.

68
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:03,654
That monstrosity will rue the day

69
00:04:03,688 --> 00:04:05,656
he denied me a meal.

70
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,725
I would not push it, Colonel.

71
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,660
That monstrosity
might make a meal out of you.

72
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,028
I don't care.

73
00:04:12,062 --> 00:04:13,630
I'm famished.

74
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:22,004
I think I can help.

75
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:37,219
Your meal awaits you, sir.

76
00:04:37,254 --> 00:04:40,156
You short-circuiting
hydrospanner,

77
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,490
that's no meal.

78
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:43,491
That is garbage.

79
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:44,826
What is the difference?

80
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,327
It is edible, is it not?

81
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,456
Agh!

82
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:17,859
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:18,960
I didn't see you there.

84
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:20,662
Look, I could get you some food,

85
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:23,799
but normally people
come in the front door.

86
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:26,936
But there's no problem.

87
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,238
You do know that
you're eating garbage, right?

88
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:34,210
You're a clone.

89
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:35,545
Excuse me?

90
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:37,581
Uh, I...

91
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:38,615
I wouldn't know about that.

92
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,316
My... my name's Gregor.

93
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,852
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

94
00:05:49,793 --> 00:05:51,159
You are a clone.

95
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:53,827
Are you working undercover?

96
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,797
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,332
Listen to me, soldier,
whatever your assignment is,

98
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:01,366
it can't be more important than mine.

99
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:03,135
It is his first real mission.

100
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,803
He is just a map reader.

101
00:06:04,837 --> 00:06:07,339
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

102
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:10,975
You are a clone and a soldier
in the Republic Army,

103
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,610
and I order you to take me to your ship.

104
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:16,313
We need to get back to Coruscant
immediately.

105
00:06:16,347 --> 00:06:19,283
Uh, look, friend,
I was just trying to help.

106
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:21,318
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

107
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,652
I do not think that soldier

108
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:26,255
believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel.

109
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,590
Gregor!

110
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:29,859
Get back to work.

111
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:32,161
Uh, excuse me.
I got to go.

112
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,430
I don't wanna lose my job.

113
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,701
But I'm still hungry.

114
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:54,715
Well, what's the scouting report?

115
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,919
Separatist droids?

116
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:03,556
Hmm, well, that complicates matters.

117
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,727
So, uh, boss,

118
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,463
you know, I was just wondering...

119
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,565
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

120
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,700
Oh, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:17,735
I don't want a raise, sir.

122
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,605
I-I just wanted to know,
what's a clone?

123
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,375
Someone told me I was a clone today.

124
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,476
They insisted.

125
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,677
Heh.
A clone?

126
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:31,114
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

127
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,283
They are brave soldiers.

128
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:36,652
Does that sound like you?

129
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:39,154
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

130
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:42,857
Forget about clones
or anything like that.

131
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:45,059
You have good life here,

132
00:07:45,093 --> 00:07:46,961
a simple life.

133
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:49,529
More than you had when Borkus found you.

134
00:07:49,564 --> 00:07:50,831
I know, sir.

135
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,232
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

136
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,266
Believe me.

137
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,501
But I thought maybe you could...

138
00:07:55,535 --> 00:07:57,903
could you tell me, how did I get here?

139
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:59,071
Where did you find me?

140
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:00,472
Enough questions.

141
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,740
Go home. Sleep.

142
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:05,109
Come back tomorrow.
Do your job.

143
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:08,412
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again,

144
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,847
understand?

145
00:08:20,771 --> 00:08:22,262
I cannot help noticing

146
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,080
that we are already on our third plan.

147
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:30,498
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

148
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:32,566
something droids are not known for.

149
00:08:34,803 --> 00:08:36,103
R2 is right.

150
00:08:36,137 --> 00:08:38,571
Droids are not known for being flexible,

151
00:08:38,606 --> 00:08:41,573
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

152
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,642
Well, answer me this, Corporal,

153
00:08:43,676 --> 00:08:46,478
if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

154
00:08:46,512 --> 00:08:48,880
were better prepared
to lead this mission,

155
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:51,582
then why did they put me in charge?

156
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,518
'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside BZ.

157
00:08:56,221 --> 00:09:00,225
No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

158
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:03,494
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

159
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,231
then there must be a landing zone nearby

160
00:09:06,265 --> 00:09:10,068
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

161
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:14,438
That, Corporal, is why <i>I</i> am in charge.

162
00:09:16,642 --> 00:09:20,678
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

163
00:09:20,713 --> 00:09:22,680
just like we did on the dreadnought,

164
00:09:22,715 --> 00:09:26,082
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

165
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,919
The mechs have a point, Colonel.

166
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:31,554
After what we did on the dreadnought,

167
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:34,690
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

168
00:09:34,724 --> 00:09:37,525
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

169
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:40,194
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

170
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:41,929
But there's no way in Malachor

171
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:44,798
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

172
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:47,399
on an assault of that landing zone.

173
00:09:47,434 --> 00:09:49,001
What is the plan now, Colonel?

174
00:09:49,035 --> 00:09:53,071
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

175
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:57,109
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

176
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,324
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

177
00:10:51,358 --> 00:10:52,758
Agh! What?

178
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,731
I...

179
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,299
I don't understand.

180
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:04,567
That's me?

181
00:11:04,602 --> 00:11:06,668
No, that's Captain Rex.

182
00:11:06,703 --> 00:11:09,337
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

183
00:11:09,372 --> 00:11:11,506
just like you, Gregor.

184
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,209
I can't believe it.

185
00:11:15,244 --> 00:11:16,843
Okay, slow down.
Slow down.

186
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:21,415
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

187
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:24,351
Millions.
A whole army's worth.

188
00:11:24,385 --> 00:11:26,086
Uh-huh.

189
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,422
And they all look exactly like me?

190
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:32,925
No, those clones are warriors,

191
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,961
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

192
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:39,230
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

193
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,666
in our war against the Separatists.

194
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,034
They're not dishwashers

195
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:46,437
living in
some vermin-infested hovel.

196
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,375
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

197
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:54,411
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

198
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,312
so he pays the difference for me.

199
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:58,014
Don't you get it, Gregor?

200
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,516
You're his slave.

201
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,717
We need to figure out
who you really are,

202
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:03,319
how you got here.

203
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:06,422
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

204
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:12,529
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

205
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:14,730
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

206
00:12:14,764 --> 00:12:19,001
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

207
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:20,268
Hmm.

208
00:12:20,303 --> 00:12:23,805
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

209
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,473
Your military records
will be in the database.

210
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,908
Scan him, R2.

211
00:12:35,117 --> 00:12:37,085
Impressive.

212
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:42,791
Gregor, your designation
is CC-5576-39.

213
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:47,328
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

214
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:49,631
A clone commando.

215
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,301
Your file says you were reported

216
00:12:53,336 --> 00:12:55,837
missing in action during

217
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,672
the Battle of Sarrish.

218
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,475
Sarrish?

219
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,477
Sarrish.

220
00:13:03,511 --> 00:13:05,579
Wait.

221
00:13:05,613 --> 00:13:07,814
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

222
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:11,717
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

223
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:14,086
Sarrish.

224
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:15,755
Yes.

225
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,757
Yes, I remember now.

226
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:20,225
So many soldiers were dying.

227
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:23,629
Do... do you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

228
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:26,732
No.

229
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:31,037
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

230
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,538
Bodies everywhere.

231
00:13:33,573 --> 00:13:35,440
I knew I had to get help.

232
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:38,644
But that's where the memory stops.

233
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,979
Well, soldier,

234
00:13:40,014 --> 00:13:43,281
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

235
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:44,416
but you can help us.

236
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:47,386
Our mission depends on it.

237
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,829
Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

238
00:13:57,863 --> 00:13:59,564
but it has been six.

239
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,867
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

240
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,369
Then I'll go back in there

241
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:06,071
and personally
knock some sense into him.

242
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:07,105
That won't be necessary.

243
00:14:07,106 --> 00:14:08,273
Whoa!

244
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,643
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

245
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,745
might bring back some more memories,

246
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,947
until we recover my equipment anyway.

247
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:18,149
I overheard you guys talking.

248
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:20,417
I think I know where my armor is.

249
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,852
Let's go check out the diner.

250
00:14:31,228 --> 00:14:33,897
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

251
00:14:33,931 --> 00:14:35,865
We do not have all night.

252
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:40,769
Looking for this?

253
00:14:45,808 --> 00:14:49,576
My uniform.
My equipment.

254
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,645
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

255
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Why?

256
00:14:53,681 --> 00:14:56,816
I don't care who you were.

257
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,718
You are dishwasher now.

258
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:02,823
And you owe me for saving you
from your crash.

259
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,426
Your life is mine, Gregor.

260
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,194
You didn't save me.

261
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,229
You turned me into a slave.

262
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,732
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

263
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,686
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

264
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,268
I want my life back.

265
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:17,637
You want your freedom, Gregor?

266
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,906
Take your gun from me.

267
00:15:19,974 --> 00:15:22,275
Show me you are a soldier.

268
00:15:23,477 --> 00:15:24,776
You see?

269
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,078
You are no soldier.

270
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,180
You are a dishwasher.

271
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:40,591
Why, you no-good droids.

272
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,827
Let go of me.

273
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:45,096
Agh! Oh.

274
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,563
Agh!

275
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,565
Take your things, Gregor.

276
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:50,967
We're getting out of here.

277
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,371
Don't leave, Gregor.

278
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:57,673
It's a big galaxy out there,

279
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,174
bigger than you know.

280
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,177
Stay here, where your life is simple.

281
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,780
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

282
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:06,448
Not for this clone.

283
00:16:06,482 --> 00:16:07,482
Ha!

284
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,017
You will never get off Abafar,

285
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,421
you and your little Republic friends,

286
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:16,791
not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

287
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,960
What are you talking about?

288
00:16:18,994 --> 00:16:23,264
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

289
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:25,266
They are mining our rhydonium

290
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,536
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

291
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,772
You will see.

292
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:35,174
You will all be stuck here

293
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:38,945
begging Borkus for a job in his diner.

294
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:03,002
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

295
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,070
Gregor.

296
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:11,842
Wait.
There.

297
00:17:11,877 --> 00:17:14,078
There's a cruiser up there.

298
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:15,713
And that shuttle, I think...

299
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:19,548
Yes, it's being loaded up
with rhydonium canisters.

300
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:22,952
Huh.

301
00:17:22,953 --> 00:17:24,087
I guess Mr. Borkus

302
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:26,722
was actually telling
the truth... for once.

303
00:17:26,757 --> 00:17:29,022
What exactly is rhydonium?

304
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:30,456
It's a fuel.

305
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,725
Mostly been mined out on Abafar.

306
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,426
It's volatile and dangerous.

307
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:39,428
Yes, we do have a new mission:

308
00:17:39,463 --> 00:17:43,165
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

309
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:44,933
I'll cover you
and clear the way, Colonel.

310
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:46,467
You all head straight to the shuttle.

311
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:48,269
I'll take care of those clankers.

312
00:17:48,303 --> 00:17:50,970
Hmm, sounds like a good plan.

313
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,706
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

314
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,477
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

315
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,444
Let's roll.

316
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,551
Hey!

317
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,455
You need authorization
to enter this area.

318
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:17,489
Agh!

319
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:20,659
Get them!

320
00:18:22,661 --> 00:18:23,795
Agh!

321
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:40,341
Good job, Gregor.

322
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,580
Look, he's up there!

323
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:58,387
Just keep moving.

324
00:18:58,421 --> 00:18:59,655
It is all under control.

325
00:19:06,963 --> 00:19:10,297
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

326
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:16,537
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

327
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:18,672
Blast them!

328
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:21,073
They are on to us.

329
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,043
Colonel, can you hear me?

330
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,212
Save yourselves!

331
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,047
Okay.
Whoa!

332
00:19:29,081 --> 00:19:30,081
Agh!

333
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:32,649
Whoa-oh-oh.

334
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:45,159
Did everybody make it?

335
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:47,695
No, BZ and the colonel
are still out there.

336
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,030
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

337
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:55,402
Agh!

338
00:19:58,138 --> 00:19:59,405
Colonel, you all right?

339
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,974
I'll never make it back alive.

340
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:03,410
Yes, you will, sir.

341
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:04,944
This is what I was born to do.

342
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,712
Now, go before it's too late.

343
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:31,399
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

344
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:35,570
R2's right.

345
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:37,772
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

346
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:40,474
Don't worry about me.

347
00:20:40,508 --> 00:20:42,409
You made me remember who I am.

348
00:20:42,443 --> 00:20:44,244
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

349
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,412
Now go!

350
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,817
Where is Gregor?

351
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:52,818
Where is Gregor?

352
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:55,688
He's doing what a soldier does:

353
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:59,325
sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

354
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,817
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

355
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:29,688
We'll take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

356
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,759
and we will watch for your return.

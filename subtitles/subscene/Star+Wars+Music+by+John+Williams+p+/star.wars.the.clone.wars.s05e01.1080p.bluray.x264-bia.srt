1
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,729
Death and destruction!

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,398
Darth Maul and Savage Opress
spread chaos

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,609
as they descend on the Outer Rim.

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,403
After rescuing his brother from despair,

5
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,949
Savage and Maul murder and pillage
at every turn.

6
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,535
Fueled by rage and vengeance,

7
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,037
they search for meaning
in their new alliance

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,792
as reports of their brutal attacks
spread across the galaxy.

9
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,071
Fan out. I want a scan
of the entire perimeter.

10
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,993
SD-357, have you found
anyone in the south passage?

11
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,164
357, where are you?

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,795
Intruders!

13
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:31,758
You are trespassing on Intergalactic...

14
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,543
Look, brother, a fortune.

15
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,172
True fortune will be the demise of Kenobi.

16
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:14,176
Credit chips are meaningless
without a plan to survive.

17
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:17,054
The Jedi are hunting us.

18
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,389
We will be forced to make a stand.

19
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:22,309
And we will deal with them.

20
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,686
They are too many.

21
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,147
To continue, we need one singular vision.

22
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,150
My vision.

23
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,237
Brother, let us share our strength.

24
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:37,574
There is no need for dominance
between us.

25
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:43,830
Always two there are, my brother,
a master and an apprentice.

26
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,084
And you are the apprentice.

27
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,759
So it is time for a lesson.

28
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,731
You have grown so powerful.

29
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,946
And I shall complete your training.

30
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:20,117
Not as your brother, but as your master.

31
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,756
The distress signal is coming from here,
the Meridian sector, Cybloc system.

32
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:38,302
It is close enough to the earlier attack.

33
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,845
I have a feeling it's them.

34
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,814
They ought to be flush.

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,151
Chips were all unlocked.
No way to trace 'em.

36
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:58,614
All done by the two crabbiest Zabraks
this side of the Hydian.

37
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,658
- They were alone?
- Yep. Yep.

38
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,329
What were they?
A couple of Jedi gone rogue or something?

39
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,125
They're not Jedi.

40
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,337
Do me a favor.
Spark up that lightsaber, would ya?

41
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,176
Mmm-hmm. Well, the droids that
got attacked said that theirs were red.

42
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,056
They are Sith, and we need to find them
before they strike again.

43
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:26,350
Well, they took my cargo ship.

44
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:32,022
The droid survivors said they heard
something about the Sertar sector.

45
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,239
What is in the Sertar sector?

46
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:42,032
That's where Florrum is.

47
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,326
You've been there?

48
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,204
- What can we expect?
- Pirates.

49
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,221
Get me a read out on that ship.

50
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:07,349
There are life forms aboard.

51
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,019
The main reactor
and hyperdrive generator are down.

52
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,729
I think they're stranded.

53
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,691
And their communications?

54
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,236
Operational but silenced.

55
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:26,159
We'll kill anyone onboard and take the ship.
Let's hope they have a wealth of cargo.

56
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:50,184
Pure Sansanna spices.

57
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,770
Hondo will be pleased. We drink tonight.

58
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,815
Now find me those life forms.

59
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,194
Jedi!

60
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,203
Do you want to live?

61
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,039
Yes, very badly.

62
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,964
We will make you rich.

63
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,384
Your skills and talents could serve us well.

64
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,970
The choice is yours.

65
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,349
Are you hiring us?

66
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,643
What kind of Jedi are you?

67
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:35,312
We are not Jedi.

68
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:40,150
We are lords, crime lords.

69
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,319
We work for Hondo.

70
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,073
You'll have to pay us really well
to get us to betray him.

71
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,826
Money is of no object for men like us.

72
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,497
You will have all that you desire and more

73
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,542
if you pledge yourselves to me.

74
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:02,881
All right. I'm tired of working
for Hondo anyway.

75
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:08,345
I'll call up a couple of the boys
and see if they'll join us.

76
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:21,024
I am certain Captain Hondo
will never throw in with you.

77
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,405
Hondo's base will soon be ours,
and he will not survive this

78
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,201
unless he embraces
the same choice I give you now.

79
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,624
- Ha! I'm in.
- So am I.

80
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,628
I am not sure.
Let's see what Hondo says about that.

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:51,305
Three of your lieutenants
have already sworn allegiance to me.

82
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,141
Traitors! Scum!

83
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,227
I'm so proud,

84
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,314
but so betrayed!

85
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:05,736
There is a penalty for resistance.

86
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,663
Let me warn you.

87
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:22,085
You are not the first laser-sword-wielding
maniac I've had to deal with,

88
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:27,549
and Hondo Ohnaka survives every time!

89
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,011
We shall see.

90
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,943
We have a match on the cargo ship.

91
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,279
It seems Maul and Savage
have picked up a pirate escort.

92
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,282
Maybe to unload the stolen cargo.

93
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm not sure the pirate Hondo would have
an alliance with Maul and his brother.

94
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,207
So you know this Hondo personally?

95
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,168
Unfortunately, yes.

96
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,966
Oi, Hondo, there's a Jedi contacting you.

97
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,760
Says his name is Kenobi.

98
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:13,428
Kenobi? Ha!

99
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,015
My, aren't we popular today?

100
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,726
Put him through. Go, go, go.

101
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,187
Greetings, Hondo.

102
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:27,276
Greetings? What kind of menace
have you brought to my planet now?

103
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,403
First, you lose this system,

104
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:33,574
and Grievous comes in
and destroys my entire stronghold,

105
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,369
leaving me here to just rummage
through the leftovers

106
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,038
of my once great empire.

107
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:44,209
And now, these two horned men show up.

108
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,379
Who are these horny-headed maniacs?

109
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,631
They don't seem like normal Jedi.

110
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,844
Not Jedi, Hondo. Sith.
We tracked them here.

111
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:58,932
They just threatened to attack
with a group of my men.

112
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,392
My own men!

113
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,561
Yes, we are looking at them right now.

114
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:06,815
A cargo vessel and three of your starships.
They are heading toward you, Hondo.

115
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,820
More to the point, are you going
to help me when you get here?

116
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:13,739
There's nothing we can do about your men,

117
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:16,658
but we can certainly do something
about the Sith.

118
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:22,414
Good! I'll deal with my men.
You deal with those tattooed crazies.

119
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:23,874
Right.

120
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:45,270
Well, that settles it.
Those traitors are no longer my men.

121
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,616
I want their tongues!

122
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:28,647
The Jedi, brother, they've found us!

123
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:34,194
No. It's too soon. My plan isn't finished yet.

124
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:36,280
Too soon.

125
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:51,670
Throwing in with pirates now?
Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen.

126
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:41,553
No. I have plans, Kenobi,
and you will not stand in my way this time.

127
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,037
No!

128
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,722
Kenobi, this way!

129
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:47,578
Take this cannon down the hall.
We will ambush those traitors there.

130
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,212
- Where are the rest of your men?
- They are setting up an ambush.

131
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,591
We can use your help.
Where is the other Jedi?

132
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,218
She's dead.

133
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,722
She's...
They are too powerful for even you?

134
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,726
I am semi-speechless!

135
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,854
I think they went this way. Over here.

136
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,480
I shall draw the brothers away.

137
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,400
Once that's done,
blast the passageway closed.

138
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,486
And leave you alone with the two crazies?

139
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,572
Well, okay.

140
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,661
Retreat! Retreat!

141
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,956
Do not let them escape.

142
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:46,929
Now!

143
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,771
Surrender.

144
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,400
We are two,
and you are no match for us both.

145
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,362
You are mistaken.

146
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,995
Are you still willing to fight me?

147
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,207
The horned men aren't interested
in helping you.

148
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,419
They are only interested in Kenobi.

149
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,324
They promised us wealth and power, boss.
Please forgive us.

150
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:53,579
Please don't kill us. We beg of you!

151
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:58,000
Kill you? I would not kill you.

152
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:03,589
Everyone, the horned men's ship
is filled with valuable goods.

153
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:09,344
As your restored leader,
I say we celebrate our reunification.

154
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,556
- To the landing pad!
- Right!

155
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,783
Savage!

156
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,335
Come, my apprentice.

157
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:46,673
This plan has failed,
but we will have another opportunity.

158
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,105
Jiro, ready the men. We're leaving.

159
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,734
My men aren't going anywhere with you.

160
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:09,112
Look at them. How powerful can they be?

161
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,115
They are running away from Kenobi.

162
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,869
Filth, you will pay for your insolence.

163
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,330
Insolence!

164
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:22,000
We are pirates!
We don't even know what that means.

165
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:23,168
Open fire!

166
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:29,466
If we kill those two,
their riches will be ours.

167
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,445
Our engines have been compromised.
Get to the escape pod.

168
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,322
It's too late.

169
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,949
Trust me, apprentice.

170
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,851
Well, Kenobi, let's get out there

171
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:07,564
and see what riches have fallen
from the sky for me and you.

172
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:12,694
- Shall we?
- Very well.

173
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,053
There's no sign of those two, boss.

174
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:43,100
Well, if the condition
of these goods is any indication,

175
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:46,061
your friends have been vaporized.

176
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,272
I wouldn't be so sure.

177
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:51,275
I cut one of them in half once,
and he survived.

178
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,944
Well, isn't that interesting.

179
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,788
I think we have closure
on this matter, Master Kenobi.

180
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,957
I disagree, Chancellor.

181
00:20:06,999 --> 00:20:10,460
Everything we've learned from this
is that the Sith are persistent.

182
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,962
They will not die.

183
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,215
I understand your reservations,
Master Kenobi,

184
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:19,636
but I am afraid we can no longer allow
this personal matter of yours

185
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,221
to be a Republic concern.

186
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:26,018
It does not appear this Darth Maul
is a direct threat to the Republic.

187
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,646
We need to redirect your efforts
to the cause at hand,

188
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:34,151
stopping Count Dooku
and thus ending the Clone Wars.

189
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:37,571
Maul was trying to build an army of pirates.

190
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:41,158
So let him. Let him play with the rabble.

191
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,660
They're just petty crooks.

192
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:47,664
It is of no relevance to the Senate
compared to the Separatist threat.

193
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:50,167
Good day, gentlemen.

194
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,672
Something is stirring in the underworld.

195
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,175
The crime families have had
too much free rein

196
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,011
since the Jedi have been distracted
by the Clone War.

197
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:05,933
I fear it is a fertile place for Maul to flourish
if he has indeed survived.

198
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,684
Hmm.

199
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,853
Right you may be, Obi-Wan,

200
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:13,273
but heed the words
of the Chancellor we must.

201
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:18,654
A personal matter this is for you.
Clouded your judgment may be.

202
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:23,659
In time, if he lives,
reveal himself again, Maul will.

203
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,745
And then swiftly we shall act.

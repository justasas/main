1
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:19,895
Mission accomplished!

2
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,898
Colonel Gascon and his droid squad

3
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:26,068
steal an encryption module
needed to crack a Separatist code

4
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,737
and stop an impending attack
on the Republic.

5
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,031
After surviving The Void

6
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,659
and escaping the hostile planet of Abafar,

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,579
our heroes finally appear to be
headed in the right direction.

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:48,006
Mmm, looks like the Jedi cruiser
is expecting the shuttle.

9
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,342
Well, I'm sure there's someone aboard

10
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,887
who can put this encryption module
to good use.

11
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:57,182
Well, soldiers,
this is the end of the mission.

12
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,393
Colonel Gascon has succeeded.

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,353
Artoo, contact the bridge.

14
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,939
Tell them I request a meal with the captain.

15
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,858
Nothing too fancy,

16
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,442
and I don't eat bantha.

17
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,947
What do you mean,
you still can't make contact?

18
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,616
I have got a bad feeling about this, Colonel.

19
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,244
Something is not right.

20
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,625
Snogwash!

21
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,128
It's probably just the effects of The Void.

22
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:30,424
All that magnetic disruption
messed up the circuitry.

23
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,847
I will not allow your frivolous worrying

24
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:40,309
to undermine this glorious moment.

25
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,311
I expect a hero's welcome.

26
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,315
Not to mention my inevitable promotion
to P1 Brigadier.

27
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,674
Wow, they really went overboard
on the welcoming committee.

28
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,345
Good question, Qutee.

29
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,515
Why are there not any other shuttles
or crew members?

30
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,685
Well, everyone's probably preparing to...

31
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,689
Well, they'll all wanna be there
when we break the Separatist code.

32
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:33,153
How should I know
why all the blast doors are shut?

33
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,364
That's a question
for the captain of this ship.

34
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:40,160
And one I intend to ask
just as soon as I find him.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,085
Sergeant, Colonel Meebur Gascon.

36
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,546
You have no doubt been expecting me.

37
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:54,049
I am delivering the Separatist
encryption module which...

38
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,886
Why, it's just a hologram.

39
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,399
What in the blazes is going on here?

40
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:17,239
I do not know,
but we just made the jump to hyperspace.

41
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,117
Which means somebody
is navigating this ship.

42
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:35,465
You, droids!
What are you doing on our ship?

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,468
Surrender, or you will be destroyed!

44
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:39,595
Battle droids!

45
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:53,442
The commander wants the detonator
taken to the control room.

46
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,610
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

47
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,864
Okay, lift with your legs!
Lift with your legs!

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,284
- Okay, balance.
- Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!

49
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,452
- Look out!
- My knees!

50
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,828
Good thinking back there.

51
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,624
But next time, I give the orders.
Understood?

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,127
I got it! I got it!

53
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:13,795
I don't got it!

54
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:17,799
Uh-oh.

55
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:24,181
I wasn't programmed for this.

56
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,017
Stop! Which way are we going?

57
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,396
Down here!

58
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,326
Have you seen the intruders?

59
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,829
They went that way? Roger, roger.

60
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,170
My, something very strange
is going on here.

61
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:59,842
It appears this ship
has been hijacked by Separatists.

62
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,555
What do you mean, it doesn't belong here?

63
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,518
He is right, Colonel.
This is not Republic technology.

64
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,396
Not unless they have
lowered their standards.

65
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,023
Well, what exactly do you think it is?

66
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,901
A bomb?

67
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,862
What kind of a bomb? Is it armed?

68
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,864
How long do we have? Talk to me!

69
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,369
What do you mean, "The ship is a bomb"?

70
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,872
How can the entire ship be a bomb?

71
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,053
Mother of Kwath.

72
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:51,101
There must be enough Rhydonium in here
to blow up the entire Republic fleet.

73
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:06,408
I don't know what any of this means,
but I want off this ship immediately.

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,746
My mission is over.

75
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,750
I had no orders to stop Separatist piracy

76
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,212
or disarm massive, titanic-scale bombs.

77
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:21,590
Ceefor has a good point.

78
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,092
If we do not stop this ship
before it explodes,

79
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,428
it could cost the Republic
thousands of lives.

80
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,014
Pure speculation.

81
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,267
We're evacuating this ship,
and that is an order!

82
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,065
Oh, right.

83
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,528
We'll have to wait to evacuate
until the ship is out of hyperspace.

84
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,404
By then, it could be too late.

85
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:48,367
Once we get where we are going,
my guess is, kaboom!

86
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,217
Wait!

87
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,553
Hey! No!

88
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,429
Okay! Okay!

89
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,108
I don't know, Qutee.
Where's Artoo gone now?

90
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,072
What's going on? Who is this?

91
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:32,160
I am BNl-393, an LEP servant droid.

92
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:34,746
My master called me Bunny.

93
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,957
And where is your master?

94
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,919
He was killed when the Separatists
took control of this ship.

95
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,463
Why were you hiding from us?

96
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:46,133
At first, I did not know if I could trust you.

97
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:48,760
Then I was not sure you would believe me.

98
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,470
Once you saw the truth,

99
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,431
I was simply hoping
you would abandon ship

100
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,267
and take the rest of us with you.

101
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:59,688
Rest of you? You're telling me there's
more Republic crew members onboard?

102
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,944
Did you destroy the intruders?

103
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,571
No.

104
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,950
There are Republic droids on this ship
that could ruin our plans.

105
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,289
You will search the entire ship
until the intruders are found,

106
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,291
and report back to me.

107
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,850
Is this a joke?

108
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,770
The rest of the crew is in our shuttle?

109
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,022
I told them to wait inside,

110
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,567
and that we would be leaving
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

111
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,662
You can come out now. It is okay.

112
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:08,257
These are the other crew members?

113
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,927
As you can see,
none of us can pilot a shuttle.

114
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,929
Which is why we needed you.

115
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,516
Why you need me. Hi, there. I am the pilot.

116
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,688
What is this Separatist plot?
I do not know the details.

117
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,774
I was only able
to steal the coordinates of their target.

118
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,109
Target?

119
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,989
You mean they aren't just planning
to blow up this ship?

120
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,782
I do not believe so.

121
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:37,286
The coordinates are a space station
in the Corrida system.

122
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:41,540
What? That's the site
of the Republic Strategy Conference!

123
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,131
How do I know? I was putting the finishing
touches on a report for that conference

124
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,383
when I was assigned this mission.

125
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:53,510
The Jedi Council will be there,

126
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:56,805
along with Republic officers
from around the galaxy, and...

127
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,223
What the...

128
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:01,643
The Separatists are going to ram
the station with this ship!

129
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,648
I agree. We have to do something, Artoo.

130
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,318
See if you can send a transmission
to the Republic

131
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,485
so we can warn them.

132
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,322
It is no use. We have tried that.

133
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:16,575
All transmissions from this ship
are being blocked.

134
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,497
Hmm. You're right.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

135
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,378
- Where's he going?
- Uh-oh.

136
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,672
That buzz droid is not with me.

137
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,257
It must be a spy!

138
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,219
Stop that droid!

139
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,846
Where'd he go?
We've got to find him!

140
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,515
I do not know.
I do not see him anywhere.

141
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,936
Colonel, I think I see him.

142
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,897
I think I see a whole lot of him.

143
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,232
It's a trap!

144
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,053
Good work!
You've established a perimeter.

145
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,222
There are still more coming.

146
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,106
Please tell me
you have a brilliant strategy, Colonel.

147
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,442
I don't know!
There are just so many of them!

148
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,778
What do you mean, "Get out"?

149
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,451
All right, what are you going to do?

150
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:25,787
You are going to open the airlock?
Are you crazy, Beezee?

151
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,261
Everybody, magnetize your feet!
Lock down!

152
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,725
Beezee, magnetize!

153
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,893
Magnetize!

154
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:49,603
No!

155
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,159
Artoo, close the door! Close the door!

156
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,129
Poor Beezee.

157
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:19,466
You will be missed, soldier.

158
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,677
Artoo is right.

159
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,014
Colonel, would you say something
to honor his heroic sacrifice?

160
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,851
I suppose that's appropriate.

161
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,020
I'll have to make it quick,
because we don't have much time.

162
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:36,024
When this D Squad started our mission,
I had doubts,

163
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,279
grave doubts, that we would ever survive,
let alone succeed.

164
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,281
But we worked together.

165
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,699
We didn't give up hope.

166
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,368
We showed courage in the face of death.

167
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:51,623
It shocks me to say this,
but we make an excellent team!

168
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:55,460
Now we've lost
one of our members, Beezee.

169
00:13:55,836 --> 00:14:00,632
But we must remember,
Beezee sacrificed himself for us.

170
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,677
That's what a good soldier
does sometimes.

171
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,891
The only way to honor that sacrifice
is to stop this ship

172
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,477
and prevent the Separatists
from taking any more Republic lives.

173
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,397
Are you with me?

174
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,615
Have the buzz droids reported back in yet?

175
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:27,659
No, there has been no signal from them.

176
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,996
In fact, I cannot even locate
their signal anymore.

177
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,249
We must assume, then,
that the buzz droids have failed.

178
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:38,003
I want those intruders found
before they ruin our plans.

179
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,088
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

180
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,428
All right, everybody knows the plan?

181
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:50,098
We get the injured droids to the shuttle
and distract the battle droids

182
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:54,561
while Artoo goes up to the detonator
and programs it to explode early.

183
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:56,772
Hopefully, he can make it back
to the shuttle,

184
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,441
and we can all get off the ship
before it blows up.

185
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,819
Good luck, Artoo!

186
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,076
The intruders! Destroy them!

187
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:28,220
You can make it! Hurry! Hurry!

188
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,034
We have our target in sight.

189
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,371
Full ahead. Ramming speed.

190
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,249
Evacuation plan is now underway.

191
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:01,044
I will go to the detonator
and start the countdown.

192
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,060
The worst part about our job
are these boring strategy conferences.

193
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,562
Cheer up, Anakin.

194
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:22,691
This is your chance to voice all your
complaints about military protocol.

195
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:25,485
And it looks as though
we can finally get underway.

196
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,697
I will inform Master Windu
the last straggler has arrived,

197
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,325
while you work on your attitude.

198
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:37,956
Isn't that ship coming in a little too fast?

199
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,504
There's the shuttle!

200
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,262
Careful!
You'll hit the Rhydonium!

201
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,515
Everyone, head to the ship!

202
00:16:54,598 --> 00:16:56,391
Ceefor and I will distract them.

203
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,662
You are too late.

204
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,959
Once the detonation sequence
has commenced,

205
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:24,044
there is no stopping it.

206
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,884
Now let's see if Artoo made it
to the detonator.

207
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:41,353
Artoo is in trouble! Come on!

208
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:47,234
Artoo will never make it back
to the shuttle in time!

209
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:49,486
We've got to delay the launch!

210
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,741
The cruiser has not slowed its pace.

211
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,660
Have you been able
to contact their captain?

212
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,539
Zeenine says he cannot make contact
with anyone.

213
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,333
Where's Artoo when I need him?

214
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:16,388
We've got to regroup
and head back for Artoo.

215
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,433
Well, we're changing the plan!

216
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:21,059
No one gets left behind!

217
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,979
And we're not leaving until I say so.

218
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,814
Prepare for liftoff!

219
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,172
No, it is too soon.

220
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,091
We are scanning a large amount
of Rhydonium on that ship.

221
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,468
It's a bomb!

222
00:19:31,547 --> 00:19:33,674
And you thought this conference
would be boring.

223
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,721
Mayday! Mayday!

224
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,016
Space station Valor,
this is Colonel Meebur Gascon!

225
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,518
Can anyone hear me?

226
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,855
We read you, Colonel.
This is General Skywalker.

227
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,231
What's going on out there?

228
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,859
Slight change in our mission, General.

229
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,820
The droids and I
were stowaways on that cruiser.

230
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,029
Where's Artoo?

231
00:19:56,071 --> 00:20:00,242
I'm sorry to report he was on that ship
when it blew up, sir.

232
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,870
He just saved all your lives.

233
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,873
I want a salvage team out there, now!

234
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,207
Yes, sir!

235
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:39,740
Artoo!

236
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:44,495
You made it, buddy!

237
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,330
Hey, you're a big hero!

238
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,460
There's someone here
who wants to speak to you.

239
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,969
R2-D2, are we glad to see you.

240
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,471
I am most glad.

241
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,806
Quiet, WAC, I'm talking here.

242
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:05,974
Yes, sir, Colonel.

243
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,939
In truth, I might just be a map reader,

244
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,359
and I don't have much battle experience,

245
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:20,197
but, Artoo, you are the bravest droid
I have ever met.

246
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,365
You all are!

247
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,537
I would be proud to serve with you droids
anytime, anywhere!

248
00:21:26,662 --> 00:21:29,331
Oh, I am glad to hear you say that, Colonel,

249
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:32,709
because I hear we have been assigned
to the same platoon.

250
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:37,214
We will be seeing each other every day
for the rest of the war!

251
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,800
That's great, WAC.

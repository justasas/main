1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,521
Ancient Jedi tradition!

2
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,440
Six younglings are sent to the secret
caverns of Ilum

3
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,859
where they are tested by The Gathering,

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,780
an ancient Jedi ritual where
each youngling must harvest a crystal,

5
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,242
around which they will construct
their own lightsaber.

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:36,703
Along the journey
they underwent great perils,

7
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,790
hardest of which was to face themselves.

8
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,626
Now, having passed the test,

9
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:45,796
they take their first step
into a larger world.

10
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,609
I call that move the Whirlwind of Destiny.

11
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,152
Show-off.

12
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,866
Can everyone gather around, please?

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,122
You have all successfully passed
The Gathering

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,999
and harvested your crystals.

15
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,670
So, when do we start to build our sabers?

16
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,797
Place your crystals on the table.

17
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,841
Your lesson begins now.

18
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:34,928
May I introduce you to architect
and lightsaber designer, Huyang.

19
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,524
These are them?

20
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,861
I swear they get younger every expedition.

21
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,363
All have passed The Gathering?

22
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,698
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,200
Are you sure?

24
00:01:56,283 --> 00:02:00,120
But he's a droid.
You expect us to learn from a droid?

25
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:01,914
Who said that?

26
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,044
Many years I have been on this ship
teaching many a Jedi before you,

27
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,922
and I will continue teaching
many a Jedi after you.

28
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,883
Call me what you want,
but inside my memory banks,

29
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:15,886
I contain a record
of every lightsaber ever made

30
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,971
- and the Jedi who fashioned them.
- Whoa!

31
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,389
- Look at that!
- Which will you choose,

32
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,975
a simple grip, the curved approach,

33
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,728
one inlaid with the bone
of the Cartusion whale,

34
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,106
pastillion ore or black onk? Well?

35
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,569
From Battles of Rashfond,
to the Peacekeeping of Parliock,

36
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,987
to our very own Clone Wars,

37
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,658
the lightsaber is a Jedi's only true ally.

38
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,951
But how do they work?

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,453
Yes, you have brought me crystals,

40
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,956
but they're all useless
unless you give them life.

41
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,001
Do you know how to awaken the Force
within the crystal?

42
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:49,169
No?

43
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,672
Then I suggest you listen and learn

44
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,676
until you think of a question
this droid cannot answer.

45
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,386
A Wookiee.

46
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,930
Rare, you are to the Jedi.

47
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,724
Proud, your people must be.

48
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:06,019
Unique, just as your lightsaber will be.

49
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,981
Hold out your hand, Wookiee.

50
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,900
Describe what you see your saber to be.

51
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,614
No, no, no, not what you imagine,

52
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:19,908
but what feel in your hand.

53
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,326
Concentrate.

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,539
What will make you strong in battle
and humble in retreat?

55
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,583
What connects with your Force?

56
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:38,051
Yes, wood. Not a common choice.

57
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,388
And only wood from the Brylark tree
is as strong as metal.

58
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,724
Let me see. Where would we find that

59
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:49,605
all the way out here, far from anywhere,
deep in space?

60
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:56,195
Let's see what we have. Let me see.

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,907
No, no, no.

62
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,826
Ah. I wondered where I'd put that.

63
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,703
Oh. That's not mine.

64
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,122
Ah! Ah!

65
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,958
What do we have here?

66
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,715
Look at that!

67
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,886
You can say that again.

68
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,304
Wow.

69
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,640
It is my job that before you leave this ship,

70
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,768
you will have everything you need
to build your lightsabers

71
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,270
and the knowledge of how to do it.

72
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:34,024
So let us begin.
There is much more work to be done.

73
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,664
Well, where are they?

74
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,124
The Jedi ship is right in front of us, sir.

75
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,711
Lose them,
and you'll lose more than your head.

76
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,673
Our attack must be swift and devastating.

77
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,717
They cannot have time to get away.

78
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:05,222
I thought we weren't going to mess
with Jedi anymore.

79
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,516
These aren't Jedi.

80
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,893
My sources say they're just younglings

81
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,064
headed back to the Jedi Temple
from a training mission.

82
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:17,818
With the most important treasure
in the universe,

83
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,364
kyber crystals,
used for making laser swords.

84
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:26,076
The price for just one
would make a man rich!

85
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:31,206
And we all know how much
I like to be rich, don't we?

86
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,932
What's the rush, Petro?

87
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:53,937
With this lightsaber, I'm going
to challenge Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel

88
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,606
and kill Grievous.

89
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:11,079
The only person you are going to kill
with that, my young friend, is yourself.

90
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,459
You have inverted the emitter matrix
which will cause the power grid to backfire.

91
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,504
Light this, and all that will be left
of you and your lightsaber

92
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,297
will be your crystal.

93
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:25,469
Start again.
And this time, please follow the diagram.

94
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:42,486
Remember, quiet your mind
and concentrate.

95
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,988
The design will become clear.

96
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:50,160
Good. Gently. Trust the Force.

97
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,287
What was that?

98
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,832
I don't know. Hold on.

99
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,671
Artoo, what's happened?

100
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,841
Where?

101
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,343
Oh, no.

102
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,892
They're aiming
for the hyperdrive. Get us out of here!

103
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,029
I don't like the sound of that.

104
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,782
Stay here. I'll check on the younglings.

105
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,788
Excellent shot.

106
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,124
Fire the grappling harpoons!

107
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:43,714
Now, reel them in,

108
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,758
and let's get what we came for.

109
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,591
What's happening?

110
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,092
We're being boarded.

111
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,928
Here! Why?

112
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,096
I don't know.

113
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,560
Quickly, give me your crystals,
and I will hold onto them until we are safe.

114
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,861
Younglings! Younglings!

115
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,446
- Who's attacking the ship?
- Pirates.

116
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,408
Pirates! They'll kill us all.

117
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,245
Perhaps we should hide
in the ventilation shaft.

118
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,413
Follow me.

119
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,084
Hiding is for cowards.
We should stand and fight.

120
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,421
We're going to fight.
Just not the way they expect.

121
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:50,632
Time to go.

122
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,468
Is this part of our training?

123
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,678
It is now.

124
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,358
Shh.

125
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:13,822
Hondo says find the kids
and bring them to him.

126
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:16,074
Dead or alive?

127
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,367
Yes.

128
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:21,955
We must have courage, young Jedi.

129
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:27,127
Ganodi and Zatt, I need you to get
to the cockpit, find Artoo, and secure it.

130
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,588
The rest of you, take Professor Huyang,

131
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,258
and seal yourselves inside the hold
and wait for my command.

132
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,427
What are you going to do?

133
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,305
I'm going to reroute enough power
to the engines

134
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,601
so that we can break free
of the pirate ship's hold on us, okay?

135
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,562
What about the pirates
already onboard the ship?

136
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,648
Once the docking tube is ruptured,

137
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,234
when the ships pull apart,
a vacuum will be created

138
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,695
which will suck the pirates off our ship
and into space.

139
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,533
- Will we be sucked into space?
- No.

140
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:01,870
The cockpit and the hold
will be sealed and still have air.

141
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,999
Do not, and I mean do not,
engage the pirates.

142
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,544
Your only job is to stay hidden.

143
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,295
Do you understand?

144
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:12,881
Now go.

145
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:26,770
I smell profit! Ha ha!

146
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:30,607
Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits.

147
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,484
Well?

148
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,029
We've secured the ship,
but she seems deserted.

149
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:40,200
Imbecile!
That is the oldest trick in the book.

150
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,871
The runts are probably hiding
in the ventilation system.

151
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,999
Oh, right, didn't think of that.

152
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,042
Why does that not surprise me?

153
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:54,298
All that matters is you find the younglings
and bring me the crystals.

154
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,467
If anything gets in the way, kill it!

155
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,720
But, boss, they're just kids.

156
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:04,808
"They're just kids."
When will they learn?

157
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,394
In case you lack motivation,

158
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:13,066
remember that on the black market
these crystals are priceless.

159
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,030
We can't fit in there!

160
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,240
Smoke them out!

161
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,826
You heard the boss.

162
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,343
I do love me a party.

163
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,367
Hold it!

164
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,580
Ah!

165
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,041
- Get off him.
- Easy there.

166
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,336
That's no way to make friends, now, is it?

167
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,509
Thanks, buddy.

168
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,390
Come on, keep up.
The hold is not much further.

169
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,016
Something's wrong.

170
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,576
Unhand me, brigand!

171
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:48,745
Well, hello, girls and boys.

172
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,541
We've been looking forward
to meeting you.

173
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,008
Now be nice and hand over your crystals.

174
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,510
Over my dead body.

175
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:06,889
That can be arranged.

176
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:12,102
Petro, no.

177
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,230
Your emitter matrix is still inverted.

178
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,858
So, which one of you is first?

179
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:20,777
All bark, no bite.

180
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,863
Ah.

181
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:27,326
That's for me.
I always wanted one of these.

182
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,453
You sure you can handle it?

183
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,542
Everybody get down.

184
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,552
Let's go!

185
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:47,095
Hurry! Hurry! This way, younglings!

186
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,778
You could've killed him.

187
00:15:02,861 --> 00:15:04,363
Look, we can keep running,

188
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:07,908
or we can stand and fight
and show these pirates we're not afraid!

189
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,829
I cannot approve of such action.

190
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:15,165
Besides, I have been damaged
and cannot aid you in battle.

191
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,088
Petro's right. It's our only choice.

192
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,965
Fight or be killed.

193
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:35,227
Zatt, come in.

194
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,813
I am overriding
the emergency power fail-safe

195
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,690
and routing energy to the engines.

196
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,816
It's working.

197
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,902
Any word from the others?
Have they reached the hold?

198
00:15:44,111 --> 00:15:47,406
- Uh, not yet.
- Where are they?

199
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:50,325
I don't know. I didn't hear from them.

200
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:53,412
Great. I know what that means.

201
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,961
Set them to the highest level.

202
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,053
Get him.

203
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,724
Gungi!

204
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,777
Here, kiddie kiddies.

205
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:31,909
You can come out now, innit?
No one's gonna hurt you.

206
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,163
Zatt, close the door to the training room.

207
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,123
Katooni! Where are you guys?

208
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,918
No time to explain. Just close the door!

209
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,920
Artoo, close the door!

210
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,091
Hey, what's going on?

211
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,284
We can't make it.

212
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,622
There are too many blocking the hold.

213
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,466
Well, children,
you have put up quite a fight,

214
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,718
but playtime is over.

215
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:37,349
Now, hand over my crystals,
and no one gets hurt much.

216
00:17:42,646 --> 00:17:46,900
Hondo, the Jedi Council will not take kindly
to this attack.

217
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,528
Ahsoka.

218
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,823
How will they know who is responsible

219
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,826
if there is no one left to tell the tale?

220
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,246
You seem less hospitable
than our last meeting.

221
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,040
My mood is based on profit,

222
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:06,253
and today, I am in the mood for crystals.

223
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:10,174
You want the crystals, come and get them!

224
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:18,682
Easy now!

225
00:18:18,765 --> 00:18:20,100
Hurry, hurry!

226
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,020
What about Ahsoka?

227
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,521
Trust her. Now get in there!

228
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,523
Oh!

229
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,942
How dare you!

230
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,446
I've lived on this ship 1,000 years
and never lost a fight.

231
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:35,073
I'm not about to start today.

232
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,077
Ah!

233
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,960
You know, had I known you were here,

234
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:51,048
I would have simply asked
for the crystals directly,

235
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,091
and we could have avoided all of this.

236
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:54,760
I don't want to hurt you, Hondo.

237
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:58,639
I know and, and I appreciate that.

238
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,558
We're all in the hold,

239
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,560
but Ahsoka's still out there
fighting the pirates.

240
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,314
Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in.
They've made it to the hold.

241
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,732
Then what are you waiting for?

242
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,067
But what about you?

243
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,443
Do it!

244
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,762
What are you doing?

245
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,181
Getting you off my ship.

246
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:09,334
Whoa!

247
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,225
We're all clear.
Make the jump to hyperspace.

248
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,699
Yes! We did it! They're off the ship!

249
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,872
Oh, Professor.

250
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,500
Bring him here. I'll fix him.

251
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,047
You should have seen Ahsoka.
She took them all on by herself!

252
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,341
Where is Padawan Tano?

253
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,718
Padawan Tano, come in.

254
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,054
Ahsoka?

255
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,517
Ahsoka? Ahsoka, are you there?

256
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,612
You have cost me greatly today, young one.

257
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,949
And since you lost me so much profit,

258
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,285
I am left with no choice

259
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,043
but to turn you into

260
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,879
profit.

261
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,882
Good night.

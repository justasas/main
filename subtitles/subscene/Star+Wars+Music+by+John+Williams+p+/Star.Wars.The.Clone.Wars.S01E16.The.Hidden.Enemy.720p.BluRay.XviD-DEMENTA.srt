So, Chopper, old boy. What's your alibi?

166
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,629
-I was in the mess hall.
-No, you weren't! You...

167
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,464
I mean, you...

168
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,426
If you know something, kid,
you should speak up.

169
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,264
Chopper came in a lot later,
after everyone else.

170
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,987
My loyal informant
let me know you were coming.

171
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,157
Well, then we thank you
for your hospitality.

172
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,542
<font color="#404040">REX:</font> Where were you
before you went to the mess, Chopper?

173
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,961
Nowhere. Walking around.

174
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,006
Son, you know
we'll need a better answer than that.

175
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,340
<font color="#DF01D7">(SIGHS)</font>

176
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,802
I was hiding at the south exit.

177
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,140
I didn't want anyone to see me
string these together.

178
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,601
Battle droid fingers.

179
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:56,858
I just wanted something back.
I guess I felt like they owed me.

180
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,487
I always knew
there was something deficient about you.

181
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,033
This isn't good, Chopper.

182
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:09,454
Lying about where you were,
taking forbidden items from a battlefield,

183
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:14,209
I know. I put up with the attitude
'cause you have skill.

184
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,962
But if you could break these rules,
your whole character's in question here.

185
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,547
Wait, no. Hang on.

186
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,216
I'm no spy!

187
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,894
Chopper, we're all brothers.

188
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,189
But how can we trust
anything you say now?

189
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,651
-No, sir, I'm telling you, I did not...
-It's okay.

190
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,861
We'll get you a proper investigation.

191
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,406
You don't have to say anything
till the Jedi come back and talk to you.

192
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,159
Maybe you should talk, sir.
Tell them where you went.

193
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,413
I was at the south exit, remember?
I saw you go in, sir. I saw you.

194
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,750
-Chopper, I have been patient...
-Everyone else turned right,

195
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,377
toward the barracks and the mess.

196
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,213
You turned left,
toward the command center.

197
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,382
Where were you going, sir?

198
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,051
Obviously, the kid feels cornered.

199
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,930
Sergeant! What did you mean,
"till the Jedi come back"?

200
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,891
How did you know the Jedi were gone?

201
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,604
I really wish you hadn't noticed that, sir.

202
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:19,858
It's Slick?

203
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,778
Slick's the traitor?

205
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,928
-I've got someone by the gunships.
-That's our Slick.

206
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,806
Now that he's exposed,
he has to get out of this base.

207
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,435
There's no escape now,
you piece of rankweed!

209
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,858
Move. Move!

210
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,122
He took out our weapons depot.

211
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,295
He knew where we'd look.
He's not trying to escape.

212
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,298
He knows all our moves
before we even make them.

213
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,932
-Give up, Ventress.
-I'm all yours, Obi-Wan.

214
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,360
You've served your purpose.

215
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,403
We have to get back. Now.

these days, isn't it?

218
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,827
What's the plan, Master?

219
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:57,830
Bringing us here was a mistake, my sweet.

220
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,500
You've overestimated your abilities.

221
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,293
Really?

222
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,974
Come and get me, boys.

223
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,270
You didn't tell us
you were bringing friends.

224
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,439
Poor Obi-Wan.

225
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,441
You've been betrayed,

226
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,277
and now we're about to take control
of this world.

227
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,075
How do we get this guy?

228
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,619
Sir! Slick ran into the command center.

229
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,664
You guys stay here. Seal the perimeter.

230
00:16:58,183 --> 00:16:59,434

Have General Loathsom
delay the Jedi as long as possible.

235
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,333
I will need time to execute
the next part of my master's plan.

Yes, mistress.

My cover's blown, it's time to go,

239
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,319
but I decide not to use a ship
because it's too obvious.

240
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,868
The lockdown.

241
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,912
He wants to get around the lockdown.

242
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,289
He's blinded us by taking out the power.

243
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,625
He could disable
the entire security system!

244
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,878
Yeah, but he knows
we'd expect him to do that.

245
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,300
Or does he?

246
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,344
Yeah, I see what you're getting at.

247
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,678
Go to the south exit.

248
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:21,808
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll stay here, get the power back up.

249
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,768
-That'll help.
-Got it.

250
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,360
Hey, there, Slick.

251
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,445

You know what's funny, traitor?

253
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,871
We knew you'd never take a chance
on the exits while they were blocked.

254
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,125
I'd stay here to open them myself first.

255
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,876
Just like you.

256
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,880
Don't do a job till you've guaranteed
the best odds, right?

257
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,715
You knew I was here.

258
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,886
Of course we knew.
You think we wouldn't have a plan?

259
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,179
I'm not the traitor.

At least I got something
out of all this suffering.

264
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:32,503
Yeah, I bet you sold out your brothers
for some real shiny coin, huh?

something more important,

something you wouldn't understand!

I think freedom's gonna have to wait, kid.

272
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,824
He gave us a bit of a chase, sir.

It's the Jedi

We serve at your whim.

I just wanted something more.

279
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,596
And all you had to do to get it
was put the rest of us all at risk.

280
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,682
I love my brothers.

281
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,145
You're too blind to see it,
but I was striking a blow for all clones.

282
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,066
If you loved your brothers,
you wouldn't have put them at risk.

283

You betrayed every one of us.

284
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,071
Take him to lock-up.

285
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,702
Were you able to salvage anything
from the weapons depot?

286
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,872
Slick pretty much
scorched the whole thing.

287
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,124
That seemed to be
what he was going for all along.

We managed to save
the heavy cannons, though.

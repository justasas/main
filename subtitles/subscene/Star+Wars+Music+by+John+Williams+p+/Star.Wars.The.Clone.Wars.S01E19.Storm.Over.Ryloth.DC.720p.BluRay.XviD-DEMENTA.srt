00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,736
This'll do it.

165
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,322
You wanted to see me, Master?

166
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,700
Ahsoka, hand me that socket plug.

167
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,703
Here.

168
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,832
Thanks, Snips. How are you feeling?

169
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:12,962
-Oh, I'm fine, Master. Just fine.
-That's good to hear.

170
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,965
I'm gonna need you level-headed
if we're gonna pull this thing off.

171
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,009
Pull this off? Pull what off?

172
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,054
I talked to Master Windu.

173
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,598
We are to proceed with our attack
on the blockade.

174

175
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,563
Ahsoka, we have to break that blockade.

176
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,899
The Twi'leks on Ryloth
are depending on us.

177
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,070
I understand that, Master,
but we've lost so many men.

178
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,947
Did we get more support?

179
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,158
No. We have to make do
with the forces we have,

180
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,160
and I need to come up with a plan.

181
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:48,164
-You don't even have a plan?
-Don't worry, Ahsoka.

182
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:53,128
No! That's what you said last time,
and now everyone's gone.

183
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,838
-My whole squadron!
-Ahsoka...

184
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,965
We can't just smash
through that blockade!

-Yes, Captain.

The starship Defender
is being evacuated, sir.

202
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,743
-Evacuated? Why?
-I'm not sure, Commander.

203
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,996
We're on our way to help
General Skywalker in the hangar.

204
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,173
All right, men, all right. This way.

205
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,718
Come on, move it, move it! Let's go.
No time to waste.

206
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,971
Master, I'm almost afraid to ask.

207
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,057
I ordered the Defender evacuated.

208
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,978
-I can see that. Why?
-Actually, I got the idea from you.

209
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,313
Oh!

210
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,481
Great.

211
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,399
Rex, take over, will you?

212
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,902
You said we couldn't just smash
through the blockade.

213
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,112
I decided that's partly true.

214
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,782
You also implied
that my plans put a lot of people at risk,

215
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,160
-and I agree with you on that one.
-That's a first.

216
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,746
I decided the only way
we can break the blockade

217
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,084
is if I pilot the Defender right into their
battleship and take out the Commander.

218
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,087
-What?
-This way I'm the only one at risk.

219
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,173
Besides, the Defender is damaged already.

220
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:05,927
You can't be serious, Master. You'll die!

221
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,596
No, I won't. That's where you come in.

222
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,516
The enemy can't stop that ship
from taking them out.

223
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,644
Artoo and I will get in an escape pod
and jettison right before impact.

224
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,647
But the enemy fleet is right there!

225
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,277
I know, and I'll pretty much be defenseless
in an escape pod.

226
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,697
So I'm depending on you
to engage the remaining fleet

227
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,490
with the combined forces we have here.

228
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,119
Master, I... I can't.

229
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,789
If something goes wrong, I...
I can't be responsible for it.

230
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,208
You are responsible, Ahsoka.

231
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:41,671
These men are depending on you,
and this time, so am I.

232
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,715
But, Master, last time I thought...

233
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,801
Attention! Everyone, attention!

234
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,470
All right, men, listen up.

235
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,474
I'm taking over the Defender, and
I'm leaving Commander Ahsoka in charge.

236
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,143
She'll lead the second half of the mission

237
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,604
when we engage
what's remaining of the blockade.

238
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,190
-Try to leave some ships for us, General.
-<font color="#DF01D7">(CHUCKLES)</font> Will do, Rex.

239
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,652
Now, Commander Ahsoka will fill you in
on the full plan.

240
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,613
-Master, wait!
-Good luck.

241
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,114

242
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,658
<font color="#404040">REX:</font> Awaiting orders, Commander.

243
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,661

244

Well, you heard her, boys. Back to work.
Come on, move it. Move it!

245
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,555
-Commander on deck!
-At ease.

246
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,060
General Skywalker is contacting you.

247
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,396
<i>All right, Ahsoka,</i>
<i>we're ready to get underway.</i>

248
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,858
Master, are you sure
you won't reconsider this?

249
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,402
<i>This is the only way. Trust me.</i>

250
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:52,742
-Better fill us in, Commander.
-Right.

251
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:02,627
<i>Count Dooku has assured me the Republic</i>
<i>forces are stretched thin in our sector.</i>

252
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:06,214
<i>They should be unable</i>
<i>to mount a counterattack.</i>

253
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,550
<i>Any attempt to do so would be suicide.</i>

254
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,389
Still, I am certain
this Skywalker will return.

255
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:19,769
His ultimate defeat
shall be my greatest victory.

256
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,816
<i>-You admire Skywalker?</i>
-As a general, yes.

257
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,986
His record shows he is a great warrior,

258
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,157
and I want him to know
it is I who has beaten him.

259
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,246
Well, I have to say this plan
is questionable.

260
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,749
Yeah, but with their general destroyed
along with their battleship,

261
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,960
the droid commanders will be in chaos.

262
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,420
Only temporarily,

263
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,423
and there's still General Skywalker
to find in all that mess.

264
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,299
-I know, but...
-In our first attack,

265
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,094
we had three fully armed cruisers,
and we failed.

266
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,931
<font color="#404040">REX:</font> I wish General Skywalker
had discussed this plan with us.

267
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:01,019
-The odds are very much against us.
-They always are.

268
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:04,647
Yes, but normally we have
General Skywalker to lead us and...

269
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,944
-I meant no offense, Commander.
-None taken.

270
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,416
Sir, an enemy ship is emerging
from hyperspace.

271
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,835
I knew he'd return.

272
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,798
-There is an incoming transmission, sir.
-Ah! Put it through.

273
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,722
<i>Greetings, Captain. I'm Anakin Skywalker,</i>
<i>general of the Grand Army of the...</i>

274
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:41,142
I know who you are, Skywalker.

275
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,561
<i>Well, my reputation precedes me, then.</i>

276
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,563
<i>I have been ordered to surrender myself,</i>

277
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>the entire crew of this vessel and my ship,</i>

278
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,362
<i>in exchange for safe passage of food and</i>
<i>medical supplies to the people of Ryloth.</i>

279
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,990
A noble gesture, Jedi.

280
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:01,120
And your capture would make me
the envy of the Separatist fleet.

281
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:06,834
Sir, even if Skywalker is successful
and destroys the battleship,

282
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,547
how will we stand up to the combined
firepower of the remaining frigates?

283
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:16,677
I thought about that,
and, well, I have an idea.

284
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,262
Go ahead, Commander.

285
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,517
If we took the Resolute and angled
her hull against the incoming frigates,

286
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,729
the bridge and hangar deck would
be relatively safe from their attack.

287
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,525
We could draw them in and
then use the bombers to outflank them.

288
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,111
The bombers would be too fast,
and they would be trapped.

289
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,948
-Hmm. I'm not sure about this, Commander.
-I... I think...

290
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,534
If we were certain
the shields would hold...

291
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,746
Perhaps a different strategy.
We need to take more time and plan.

292
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:49,752
No! We don't have any more time!
Master Skywalker needs me now!

293
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,338
He needs us now.

294
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,882
The Commander is right.

295
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,177
I know this strategy is very bold,

296
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,430
but these circumstances
call for drastic measures.

297
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:06,018
-Then the strategy will work, sir?
-Well, will it?

298
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,105
Yes, it will.

299
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,862
We have completed
the scan of the enemy ship.

300
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:19,031
-And?
-The ship is heavily damaged.

301
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,993
All power is diverted
to the forward shields.

302
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,037
-There is only one life form onboard.
-What?

303
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,582
The ship is heavily damaged.
All power is...

304
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,209
No, you insolent scraphead!

305
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,755
Skywalker, what treachery is this?
You have nothing to bargain with!

306
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,133

00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,428
<i>Oh. You can still have my ship.</i>

308
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:45,016
Sir, there's a second Republic ship
entering the system.

309
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,895
She made it! Boost the engines
and let's get out of here.

there'll be chaos.

312
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,200
We need that time
to get General Skywalker's pod

313
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,826
into the tractor beam.

314
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,703
Right, Commander.

315
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,374

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,469
I don't think they're going to attack,
Commander.

-No, wait!

327
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,226
Remember, they are droids.
They're just a little slow.

328
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,353
They'll figure it out.

329
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,565
<i>-I think the Captain left.</i>
<i>-Who's in charge?</i>

330
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,693
<i>-Not me.</i>
<i>-Not me.</i>

331
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,946
<i>-What should we do?</i>
<i>-Begin attack.</i>

The droids are attacking, sir.

334
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,210
Commander, on your order,
commence flanking maneuver.

335
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:39,672
Okay, boys. Here we go! Follow my lead.

336
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,524

-He's in an escape pod.

340
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:19,170

341
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,006
Uh, where are those escape pods?

Ahsoka, this is Obi-Wan.
May we begin our landing?

345
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,270
Yes, Master.
You're cleared for ground assault.

346
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,273
I won't even ask
where the rest of Anakin's fleet is

347
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,942
or why he's in an escape pod.

348
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,737
That's probably for the best.

349
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:49,116
Rex, that reminds me. Send a shuttle
to pick up Master Skywalker.

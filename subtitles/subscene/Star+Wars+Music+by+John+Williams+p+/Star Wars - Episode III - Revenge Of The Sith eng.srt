1
00:03:07,342 --> 00:03:08,717
Lock on to him, R2.

2
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:12,260
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead ―

3
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:14,595
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:14,725 --> 00:03:17,216
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:27,440
- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.

6
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:29,814
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,823
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:33,860
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:49,794
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,921
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,820
They're all over me.

12
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,950
- Get them off my ―
- I'm gonna go help them out.

13
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:17,447
No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.

14
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,338
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,971
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,025 --> 00:04:47,809
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:54,158
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,295 --> 00:05:05,003
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,508
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:26,271
- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.

21
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:27,517
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,161
R4, be careful. You have a ―

23
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,203
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,170
They're shutting down
all the controls.

25
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,421
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,708
The mission.
Get to the command ship.

27
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:53,252
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,434
In the name of ―

29
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:06,723
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:15,911
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,080
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:27,797
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:32,252
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,545
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,395
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:48,445 --> 00:06:49,820
Watch out.

37
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,776
R2, hit the buzz droid's centre eye.

38
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:06,292
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,506
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

40
00:07:12,636 --> 00:07:14,676
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?

41
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:16,180
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,433
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,165
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:56,969
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:08,026
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there ―

46
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:11,188
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:13,231
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:13,366 --> 00:08:15,987
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:18,653
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,579
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,584
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

52
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,386
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,436
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:50,853
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:57,066
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,129
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,129
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,592
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,182
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,607
There's more than
one way out of here.

61
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,569
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,530
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,569
- Come in, R2.
- What that?

64
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,579
R2, do you copy?

65
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:46,124
R2, activate
the elevator number 31174.

66
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,963
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,008
Activate the elevator 31174.

68
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,594
R2 ―

69
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,725
Always on the move.

70
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,807
R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?

71
00:10:06,983 --> 00:10:08,525
R2?

72
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:12,481
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,829
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,164
Hands up, Jedi.

75
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:26,450
R2, do you copy?

76
00:10:26,586 --> 00:10:30,536
R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.

77
00:10:35,428 --> 00:10:36,673
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,513
That's better.

79
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,186
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:58,536 --> 00:10:59,995
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:03,914
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:07,375
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been ―

83
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,496
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,539
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,213 --> 00:11:51,087
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:52,674
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:01,261
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,234 --> 00:12:13,437
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:17,607
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,575
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:20,703 --> 00:12:24,154
We don't want to make a mess of
things in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,496
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:39,422
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:39,556 --> 00:12:42,723
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:46,302
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

96
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,366
Get ―

97
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:36,697
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,778
You have hate.
You have anger.

99
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:43,487
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,550
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:07,772 --> 00:14:09,017
Kill him.

102
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:12,067
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,617
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,574
Do it.

105
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:38,552
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:41,842
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

107
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:45,055
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,056
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:53,275
It is only natural. He cut off
your arm, and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,525
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,279
Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?

112
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:06,662
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:14,042
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:16,499
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,511
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,680
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:28,772 --> 00:15:30,930
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:35,144
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,206 --> 00:15:47,115
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:50,878 --> 00:15:53,499
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,483
- Reverse stabilisers.
- Reversing stabilisers.

122
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,880
Magnetise! Magnetise!

123
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:46,760
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:51,816 --> 00:16:53,690
We're levelling out, sir.

125
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,617
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.

126
00:17:11,753 --> 00:17:14,326
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:14,464 --> 00:17:16,622
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:18,715
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:18,844 --> 00:17:20,042
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:38,019
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,231
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:40,991 --> 00:17:42,616
R2, do you copy?

133
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:51,326
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,785
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:56,758 --> 00:17:58,038
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,176 --> 00:18:01,047
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,507
Apparently not.

138
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,683
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,052
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,894
and then he'll release
the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,316
See? No problem.

142
00:18:25,662 --> 00:18:27,240
Don't move.

143
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,500
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,501
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:43,713
The negotiator.

146
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:48,060
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:49,348
Excuse me.

148
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:53,179
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:55,442
And ―

150
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,602
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:04,444
I was expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little... older.

152
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:10,869
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:14,789
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:18,372
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:27,803
Your light sabres will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:31,600
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,726
R2.

158
00:19:37,736 --> 00:19:39,111
Crush them!

159
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,571
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:48,281
Come. Now!

161
00:19:48,414 --> 00:19:50,572
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,257 --> 00:19:59,131
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:19,983
Run!

164
00:20:23,575 --> 00:20:25,449
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,866
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,132 --> 00:20:40,801
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:06,699
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:19,883 --> 00:21:22,339
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:29,602 --> 00:21:31,974
All the escape pods
have been launched.

170
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:35,140
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,979
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,942
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,236
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,869
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,762
We lost something.

176
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,346
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:16,601
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:25,284 --> 00:22:27,075
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:27,995 --> 00:22:30,486
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:44,387 --> 00:22:46,047
Steady.

181
00:22:48,891 --> 00:22:50,219
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,063
5000.

183
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,099
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,938
- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.

185
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:06,113
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:37,608 --> 00:23:39,565
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,844
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:15,393
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,930
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:21,899
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:25,149
Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.

192
00:24:25,282 --> 00:24:27,654
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:29,694
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

194
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:32,281
All because of your training.

195
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:35,914
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:36,043 --> 00:24:39,412
and you deserve your glorious
day with the politicians.

197
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:43,248
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,664
Ninth time.

199
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:49,598
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:57,471
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

201
00:24:57,607 --> 00:25:00,478
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:05,272
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:08,906
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:13,330
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:15,331
And I assure you...

206
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:19,160
the senate will vote to continue the
war as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:23,341
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:24,844 --> 00:25:26,718
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:26,846 --> 00:25:29,800
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:32,055
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,723
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:38,355
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,188
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,531
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:46,574 --> 00:25:49,065
I will do everything
I can in the senate.

216
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:51,903
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,719
I've missed you, Padmé.

218
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:13,135
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

219
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:15,142
I'm all right.

220
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,893
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

221
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:21,811
And it might have been, if the
chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

222
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:25,278
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

223
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:28,027
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

224
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,610
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

225
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,988
Anakin, don't say things like that.

226
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:46,424
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

227
00:26:46,553 --> 00:26:48,676
What's going on?

228
00:26:50,765 --> 00:26:52,923
Something wonderful has happened.

229
00:26:54,853 --> 00:26:58,187
Ani, I'm pregnant.

230
00:27:10,077 --> 00:27:11,655
That's wonderful.

231
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,538
What are we gonna do?

232
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:21,418
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

233
00:27:22,214 --> 00:27:24,005
This is a happy moment.

234
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,299
The happiest moment of my life.

235
00:28:34,163 --> 00:28:37,283
Yes, Lord Sidious?

236
00:28:37,417 --> 00:28:39,291
General Grievous...

237
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:44,496
I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.

238
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:47,669
It will be done, my lord.

239
00:28:48,595 --> 00:28:52,842
The end of the war is near, General.

240
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:56,560
But the loss of Count Dooku ―

241
00:28:56,687 --> 00:29:00,815
His death was a necessary loss.

242
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:05,226
Soon I will have a new apprentice ―

243
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:10,605
one far younger
and more powerful.

244
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,646
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

245
00:29:40,774 --> 00:29:44,108
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

246
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:46,110
where we can be safe.

247
00:29:47,364 --> 00:29:49,653
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

248
00:29:53,537 --> 00:29:57,665
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

249
00:30:02,254 --> 00:30:05,540
You are so... beautiful.

250
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:09,216
It's only because I'm so in love.

251
00:30:11,847 --> 00:30:13,970
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

252
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,017
So love has blinded you?

253
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:22,521
That's not exactly what I meant.

254
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,150
But it's probably true.

255
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,865
Anakin, help me!

256
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,431
What's bothering you?

257
00:31:45,527 --> 00:31:46,855
Nothing.

258
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,154
I remember when
I gave this to you.

259
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:55,444
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

260
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,494
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

261
00:32:02,294 --> 00:32:06,707
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

262
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,121
And?

263
00:32:11,595 --> 00:32:13,504
And it was about you.

264
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,382
Tell me.

265
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,686
It was only a dream.

266
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,570
You die in childbirth.

267
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,495
And the baby?

268
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,910
I don't know.

269
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,622
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

270
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,383
This baby will change our lives.

271
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,300
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

272
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,804
If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled ―

273
00:32:57,935 --> 00:32:59,844
I know. I know.

274
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,231
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

275
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:08,270
We don't need his help.

276
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,610
Our baby is a blessing.

277
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,301
Premonitions?

278
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:31,886
Premonitions.

279
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:35,219
These visions you have ―

280
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,935
They're of pain, suffering.

281
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,772
Death.

282
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:48,276
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

283
00:33:50,239 --> 00:33:51,781
Someone.

284
00:33:51,907 --> 00:33:53,781
Close to you?

285
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:56,453
Yes.

286
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:01,161
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

287
00:34:01,292 --> 00:34:05,586
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

288
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,331
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

289
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,386
Death is a natural part of life.

290
00:34:14,514 --> 00:34:19,176
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

291
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:22,560
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

292
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:25,773
Attachment leads to jealousy.

293
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,316
The shadow of greed that is.

294
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:31,652
What must I do, Master Yoda?

295
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:35,401
Train yourself to let go...

296
00:34:35,535 --> 00:34:38,951
of everything you fear to lose.

297
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:52,213
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

298
00:34:53,554 --> 00:34:55,926
I'm sorry. I was held up.

299
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:59,924
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

300
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:05,221
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

301
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:07,232
What's wrong, then?

302
00:35:08,736 --> 00:35:13,528
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

303
00:35:13,658 --> 00:35:17,987
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

304
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:20,529
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

305
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,581
Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.

306
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:28,128
Be careful of what?

307
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,877
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

308
00:35:31,009 --> 00:35:33,167
He would not say.

309
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:36,838
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

310
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:39,179
All of this is unusual.

311
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,634
And it's making me feel uneasy.

312
00:35:56,744 --> 00:35:58,618
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

313
00:35:59,663 --> 00:36:00,861
Of course.

314
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,915
I need your help, son.

315
00:36:05,086 --> 00:36:07,079
What do you mean?

316
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,754
I'm depending on you.

317
00:36:10,466 --> 00:36:12,375
For what? I don't understand.

318
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,097
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

319
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:24,563
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

320
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,017
Me?

321
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,192
A master?

322
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:31,443
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

323
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:36,449
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

324
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:40,075
I think they will.
They need you.

325
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,872
More than you know.

326
00:36:53,302 --> 00:36:58,048
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

327
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,598
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

328
00:37:02,812 --> 00:37:04,354
I understand.

329
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,805
You are on this council...

330
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:09,514
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.

331
00:37:10,611 --> 00:37:11,642
What?

332
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:20,114
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

333
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:21,788
It's unfair.

334
00:37:23,792 --> 00:37:26,995
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

335
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:30,631
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

336
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,344
Forgive me, Master.

337
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:41,966
We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...

338
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:45,803
but have found no sign
of General Grievous.

339
00:37:45,939 --> 00:37:48,691
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

340
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:51,901
The outlying systems you must sweep.

341
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:54,235
We do not have
many ships to spare.

342
00:37:54,365 --> 00:37:56,523
What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?

343
00:37:57,618 --> 00:38:00,323
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

344
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:03,870
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

345
00:38:05,209 --> 00:38:07,285
Go I will.

346
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,421
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

347
00:38:10,548 --> 00:38:12,126
It's settled then.

348
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:17,253
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

349
00:38:17,389 --> 00:38:19,429
May the Force be with us all.

350
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:24,306
What kind of nonsense is this?

351
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:26,809
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

352
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,692
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

353
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:32,653
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.

354
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:35,733
To be on the council at your age ―
it's never happened before.

355
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:40,278
The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.

356
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:44,161
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

357
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:47,660
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

358
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:50,001
But it's what you wanted.

359
00:38:50,131 --> 00:38:53,417
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

360
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:55,425
That has nothing to do with this.

361
00:38:55,553 --> 00:38:58,471
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

362
00:38:58,598 --> 00:39:00,923
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

363
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:02,929
And?

364
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:06,811
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

365
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:08,102
What situation?

366
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:16,524
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

367
00:39:16,658 --> 00:39:18,983
They want to know what he's up to.

368
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,533
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

369
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:29,129
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

370
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:34,091
Why didn't the council give me this
assignment when we were in session?

371
00:39:34,218 --> 00:39:36,626
This assignment
is not to be on record.

372
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,681
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

373
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:43,809
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

374
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,012
That is why you must help us.

375
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:49,598
Anakin, our allegiance is to
the senate, not to its leader...

376
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:53,399
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

377
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:55,486
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

378
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:58,782
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

379
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,079
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

380
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,076
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

381
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,160
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

382
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:15,382
The council is asking you.

383
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,300
Anakin did not take to his new
assignment with much enthusiasm.

384
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,397
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

385
00:40:30,526 --> 00:40:32,815
I don't think
the boy can handle it.

386
00:40:32,945 --> 00:40:34,854
I don't trust him.

387
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:38,775
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

388
00:40:39,535 --> 00:40:43,200
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

389
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:46,156
So the prophecy says.

390
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:51,168
A prophecy that misread
could have been.

391
00:40:53,007 --> 00:40:54,881
He will not let me down.

392
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:56,918
He never has.

393
00:40:57,053 --> 00:41:00,054
I hope right you are.

394
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:27,958
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

395
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:31,913
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

396
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:36,966
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

397
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:38,968
What do you mean?

398
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:44,264
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

399
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:47,976
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

400
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:52,313
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

401
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,238
This war represents
a failure to listen.

402
00:41:57,365 --> 00:41:59,358
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

403
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:02,742
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

404
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:05,409
Don't ask me to do that.

405
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,618
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

406
00:42:11,504 --> 00:42:13,544
- What is it?
- Nothing.

407
00:42:14,883 --> 00:42:18,715
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

408
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:22,974
Hold me.

409
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,342
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

410
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,189
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

411
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:33,815
No politics, no plotting, no war.

412
00:43:13,068 --> 00:43:15,737
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

413
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:17,819
Come closer. I have good news.

414
00:43:19,533 --> 00:43:21,407
Our clone intelligence units...

415
00:43:21,535 --> 00:43:24,571
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

416
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:27,278
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

417
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:28,579
At last.

418
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:33,169
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

419
00:43:33,297 --> 00:43:36,631
I would worry about the
collective wisdom of the council...

420
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:39,131
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

421
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:42,595
You're the best choice, by far.

422
00:43:45,643 --> 00:43:47,102
Sit down.

423
00:43:47,228 --> 00:43:48,426
Leave us.

424
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:07,455
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

425
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:12,585
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

426
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,623
I'm not sure I understand.

427
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:19,422
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

428
00:44:19,553 --> 00:44:22,922
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

429
00:44:24,308 --> 00:44:26,217
They're planning to betray me.

430
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:29,307
- I don't think that ―
- Anakin.

431
00:44:30,522 --> 00:44:32,431
Search your feelings.

432
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:37,190
You know, don't you?

433
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:43,491
I know they don't trust you.

434
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:46,905
Or the senate.
Or the Republic.

435
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:49,612
Or democracy, for that matter.

436
00:44:50,418 --> 00:44:54,747
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

437
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,340
Why?

438
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:02,798
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

439
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,685
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

440
00:45:15,861 --> 00:45:17,735
I don't know what to say.

441
00:45:17,863 --> 00:45:21,314
Remember back
to your early teachings.

442
00:45:22,034 --> 00:45:25,818
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

443
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:30,581
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

444
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:32,832
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

445
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:38,123
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

446
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:42,929
including their quest
for greater power.

447
00:45:44,474 --> 00:45:47,475
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

448
00:45:47,602 --> 00:45:50,354
They think inwards ―
only about themselves.

449
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:53,806
And the Jedi don't?

450
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:58,476
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

451
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:13,623
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

452
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:22,804
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

453
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:26,221
It's a Sith legend.

454
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:31,349
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

455
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:34,351
so powerful and so wise...

456
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:39,311
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

457
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:42,614
to create... life.

458
00:46:44,285 --> 00:46:47,321
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

459
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:51,916
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

460
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,503
from dying.

461
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,584
He could actually...
save people from death?

462
00:47:03,471 --> 00:47:07,967
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

463
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:12,313
some consider to be unnatural.

464
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,272
What happened to him?

465
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:18,441
He became so powerful...

466
00:47:19,738 --> 00:47:21,814
the only thing he was afraid of was...

467
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:24,907
losing his power.

468
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:27,158
Which eventually, of course, he did.

469
00:47:28,372 --> 00:47:33,533
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

470
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:36,958
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

471
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:41,919
It's ironic.

472
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:44,176
He could save others from death...

473
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:47,382
but not himself.

474
00:47:51,563 --> 00:47:54,101
Is it possible to learn this power?

475
00:47:57,944 --> 00:48:00,067
Not from a Jedi.

476
00:48:16,964 --> 00:48:18,838
All Red units, over here!

477
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:33,017
Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?

478
00:48:33,856 --> 00:48:35,730
A partial message was intercepted...

479
00:48:35,858 --> 00:48:38,314
in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.

480
00:48:40,905 --> 00:48:42,981
Act on this we must.

481
00:48:44,242 --> 00:48:47,825
The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.

482
00:48:48,955 --> 00:48:51,742
Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.

483
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:56,879
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

484
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:00,293
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

485
00:49:00,425 --> 00:49:02,382
not the chancellor.

486
00:49:02,511 --> 00:49:07,422
A master is needed,
with more experience.

487
00:49:07,558 --> 00:49:10,927
I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.

488
00:49:12,146 --> 00:49:13,557
I agree.

489
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:14,804
Aye.

490
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,482
Aye.

491
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:18,517
Very well. Council adjourned.

492
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:29,121
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

493
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:34,702
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,849
Charge!

495
00:50:03,991 --> 00:50:05,900
Head for cover!

496
00:50:21,342 --> 00:50:24,213
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

497
00:50:24,345 --> 00:50:27,180
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

498
00:50:27,306 --> 00:50:28,421
Master.

499
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:35,690
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

500
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:39,564
I've been arrogant,
and I apologise.

501
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,645
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

502
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:49,693
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

503
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:52,402
I have trained you since
you were a small boy.

504
00:50:52,541 --> 00:50:54,617
I have taught you
everything I know.

505
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:58,500
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

506
00:50:59,381 --> 00:51:01,290
But be patient, Anakin.

507
00:51:02,175 --> 00:51:05,342
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

508
00:51:12,728 --> 00:51:15,978
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

509
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,977
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:41,591 --> 00:51:46,134
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

511
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:47,887
On the far side.

512
00:51:48,014 --> 00:51:50,303
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

513
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:53,849
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

514
00:51:55,272 --> 00:52:00,397
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

515
00:52:25,845 --> 00:52:27,588
Save your energy.

516
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:30,049
I can't.

517
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:31,926
Don't give up, Padmé.

518
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:47,281
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

519
00:52:47,993 --> 00:52:50,033
He came by this morning.

520
00:52:51,455 --> 00:52:53,329
What did he want?

521
00:52:53,457 --> 00:52:55,366
He's worried about you.

522
00:52:57,878 --> 00:53:00,120
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

523
00:53:03,008 --> 00:53:04,668
I feel lost.

524
00:53:05,844 --> 00:53:08,964
Lost? What do you mean?

525
00:53:10,891 --> 00:53:13,263
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

526
00:53:14,353 --> 00:53:16,761
They trust you with their lives.

527
00:53:18,524 --> 00:53:19,983
Something's happening.

528
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:23,310
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

529
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:27,607
I want more.

530
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,742
And I know I shouldn't.

531
00:53:32,872 --> 00:53:34,829
You expect too much of yourself.

532
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:42,004
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

533
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:44,041
From my nightmares.

534
00:53:44,175 --> 00:53:46,084
Is that what's bothering you?

535
00:53:47,137 --> 00:53:49,046
I won't lose you, Padmé.

536
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,966
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

537
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,508
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

538
00:54:38,481 --> 00:54:40,853
Greetings, young Jedi.

539
00:54:40,984 --> 00:54:44,400
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

540
00:54:44,529 --> 00:54:46,438
Unfortunately, the war.

541
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:51,108
There's no war here ―
unless you brought it with you.

542
00:54:51,244 --> 00:54:54,411
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

543
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:59,451
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

544
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:11,721
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

545
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:14,720
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

546
00:55:14,852 --> 00:55:19,644
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

547
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,182
Tell your people to take shelter.

548
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,272
If you have warriors, now is the time.

549
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:40,419
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

550
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,460
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

551
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:34,010
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

552
00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:41,852
I am sending you to the Mustafar
system in the outer rim.

553
00:56:49,366 --> 00:56:51,655
It is a volcanic planet.

554
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:55,071
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

555
00:56:55,914 --> 00:56:59,164
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

556
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:03,706
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

557
00:57:04,632 --> 00:57:09,757
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

558
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:15,887
Your ship is waiting.

559
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:35,032
Hello there.

560
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,415
General Kenobi.

561
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:44,917
You are a bold one.

562
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,426
Kill him.

563
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,687
Back away.

564
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,399
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

565
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,992
Your move.

566
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:14,535
You fool.

567
00:58:14,662 --> 00:58:20,451
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

568
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:29,464
Attack, Kenobi.

569
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:48,128
Army or not...

570
00:59:48,258 --> 00:59:53,335
you must realise
you are doomed.

571
00:59:53,472 --> 00:59:55,429
I don't think so.

572
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,611
Cover that corner.

573
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,707
Master Windu, may I interrupt?

574
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:06,588
General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...

575
01:01:06,714 --> 01:01:08,956
and we have begun our attack.

576
01:01:09,092 --> 01:01:10,800
Thank you, Commander.

577
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:15,007
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

578
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:17,381
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

579
01:01:17,517 --> 01:01:18,976
Yes, Master.

580
01:01:26,443 --> 01:01:28,899
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

581
01:01:29,821 --> 01:01:32,277
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

582
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:35,197
If he does not give up
his emergency powers...

583
01:01:35,327 --> 01:01:37,201
after the destruction of Grievous...

584
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:39,535
then he should be
removed from office.

585
01:01:41,041 --> 01:01:43,532
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

586
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:45,543
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

587
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:50,132
To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.

588
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:55,091
Great care we must take.

589
01:02:01,938 --> 01:02:03,397
Chancellor.

590
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,681
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

591
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:09,439
He has engaged General Grievous.

592
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,904
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

593
01:02:14,784 --> 01:02:16,741
I should be there with him.

594
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:19,195
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

595
01:02:19,331 --> 01:02:21,371
doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.

596
01:02:22,709 --> 01:02:26,789
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

597
01:02:28,507 --> 01:02:30,464
I wish I knew.

598
01:02:31,802 --> 01:02:34,293
More and more I get
the feeling that...

599
01:02:34,429 --> 01:02:36,635
I'm being excluded
from the council.

600
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:47,561
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

601
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,228
They don't trust you, Anakin.

602
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,983
They see your future.

603
01:02:55,117 --> 01:02:58,985
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

604
01:03:00,164 --> 01:03:05,206
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

605
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:11,383
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

606
01:03:12,135 --> 01:03:14,258
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

607
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:18,341
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

608
01:03:19,142 --> 01:03:22,096
Even the nature of the dark side.

609
01:03:24,106 --> 01:03:26,431
You know the dark side?

610
01:03:29,069 --> 01:03:32,355
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

611
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:34,861
one must study all its aspects...

612
01:03:34,992 --> 01:03:38,112
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

613
01:03:38,871 --> 01:03:41,991
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

614
01:03:42,124 --> 01:03:45,789
you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.

615
01:03:46,545 --> 01:03:48,538
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

616
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:54,751
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

617
01:03:55,513 --> 01:03:58,134
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

618
01:03:58,266 --> 01:04:01,884
and you will be able to
save your wife...

619
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,060
from certain death.

620
01:04:05,189 --> 01:04:07,063
What did you say?

621
01:04:07,192 --> 01:04:10,810
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

622
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,688
You're the Sith lord.

623
01:04:14,824 --> 01:04:18,656
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

624
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:23,328
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

625
01:04:25,502 --> 01:04:28,918
Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...

626
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:31,585
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

627
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:34,089
A life of significance...

628
01:04:34,219 --> 01:04:35,678
of conscience.

629
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:44,973
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

630
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:48,437
I know you would.

631
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:52,351
I can feel your anger.

632
01:04:52,488 --> 01:04:55,157
It gives you focus...

633
01:04:55,283 --> 01:04:57,608
makes you stronger.

634
01:05:03,917 --> 01:05:06,242
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

635
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:08,002
Of course. You should.

636
01:05:08,129 --> 01:05:11,130
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

637
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:13,748
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

638
01:05:14,928 --> 01:05:17,300
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

639
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:21,048
Know the power of the dark side.

640
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:23,936
Power to save Padmé.

641
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:33,649
So uncivilised.

642
01:07:41,162 --> 01:07:43,155
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.

643
01:07:43,289 --> 01:07:47,073
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

644
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:49,084
We're on our way to make sure...

645
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:51,454
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

646
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:55,207
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

647
01:07:55,343 --> 01:07:57,466
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

648
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:00,472
A Sith lord?

649
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:03,433
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

650
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,561
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

651
01:08:07,606 --> 01:08:09,729
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

652
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:12,645
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

653
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:16,318
Then our worst fears
have been realised.

654
01:08:16,448 --> 01:08:19,899
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

655
01:08:20,035 --> 01:08:22,443
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

656
01:08:22,579 --> 01:08:24,821
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

657
01:08:24,957 --> 01:08:27,875
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

658
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:30,754
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

659
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,003
There is much fear
that clouds your judgement.

660
01:08:33,132 --> 01:08:35,089
- I must go, Master.
- No.

661
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:41,253
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

662
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,928
But for now, remain here.

663
01:08:45,144 --> 01:08:47,931
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

664
01:08:50,233 --> 01:08:51,478
Yes, Master.

665
01:09:21,598 --> 01:09:23,840
You do know, don't you...

666
01:09:23,976 --> 01:09:26,301
if the Jedi destroy me...

667
01:09:26,437 --> 01:09:30,387
any chance of saving her
will be lost.

668
01:10:59,324 --> 01:11:03,737
Master Windu. I take it General
Grievous has been destroyed then.

669
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:07,112
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

670
01:11:07,249 --> 01:11:10,832
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

671
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:12,870
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

672
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:15,578
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

673
01:11:15,716 --> 01:11:17,625
The senate will decide your fate.

674
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,592
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

675
01:11:26,936 --> 01:11:29,261
It's treason then.

676
01:13:08,248 --> 01:13:11,783
You are under arrest, my lord.

677
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,214
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

678
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:19,464
The Jedi are taking over.

679
01:13:19,593 --> 01:13:22,049
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

680
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:24,385
You have lost.

681
01:13:28,269 --> 01:13:30,178
You will die!

682
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,814
He's a traitor!

683
01:13:34,942 --> 01:13:37,100
He is the traitor!

684
01:13:40,281 --> 01:13:44,445
I have the power
to save the one you love.

685
01:13:45,453 --> 01:13:47,362
You must choose.

686
01:13:48,456 --> 01:13:51,029
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

687
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,748
Don't let him kill me.

688
01:13:57,883 --> 01:14:00,588
I can't hold it any longer.

689
01:14:01,928 --> 01:14:04,004
I can't. I'm weak.

690
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:06,096
I'm too weak.

691
01:14:07,768 --> 01:14:10,224
Help me. Help me!

692
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:16,891
I can't hold on any longer.

693
01:14:17,027 --> 01:14:20,610
I am going to end this
once and for all.

694
01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:22,198
You can't.

695
01:14:22,324 --> 01:14:24,281
He must stand trial.

696
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:27,736
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

697
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:30,078
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

698
01:14:30,208 --> 01:14:32,450
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:32,585 --> 01:14:36,168
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

700
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:37,791
He must live.

701
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:43,465
- Please don't.
- I need him.

702
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:45,593
Please don't!

703
01:14:53,023 --> 01:14:54,648
Power!

704
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,860
Unlimited power!

705
01:15:17,006 --> 01:15:19,046
What have I done?

706
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:31,264
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

707
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,185
Become my apprentice.

708
01:15:35,316 --> 01:15:40,737
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

709
01:15:43,408 --> 01:15:46,362
I will do whatever you ask.

710
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:50,988
Good.

711
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:55,282
Just help me save Padmé's life.

712
01:15:57,255 --> 01:15:59,627
I can't live without her.

713
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:08,177
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

714
01:16:08,309 --> 01:16:11,263
but if we work together...

715
01:16:11,395 --> 01:16:15,393
I know we can discover the secret.

716
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:18,852
I pledge myself...

717
01:16:20,571 --> 01:16:22,445
to your teachings.

718
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:25,110
Good.

719
01:16:26,619 --> 01:16:28,410
Good.

720
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:41,084
The Force is strong with you.

721
01:16:41,217 --> 01:16:46,757
A powerful Sith you will become.

722
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:51,137
Henceforth you shall be known as...

723
01:16:51,269 --> 01:16:55,137
Darth... Vader.

724
01:17:00,112 --> 01:17:03,113
Thank you, my master.

725
01:17:05,326 --> 01:17:06,785
Rise.

726
01:17:21,259 --> 01:17:25,387
Because the council did not
trust you, my young apprentice...

727
01:17:26,973 --> 01:17:31,719
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

728
01:17:33,062 --> 01:17:35,767
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

729
01:17:35,899 --> 01:17:39,813
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

730
01:17:40,695 --> 01:17:42,070
I agree.

731
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:46,649
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

732
01:17:46,785 --> 01:17:49,454
Every single Jedi...

733
01:17:49,579 --> 01:17:52,829
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

734
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:56,493
is now an enemy of the Republic.

735
01:17:57,546 --> 01:17:59,503
I understand, Master.

736
01:18:00,299 --> 01:18:02,208
We must move quickly.

737
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:04,252
The Jedi are relentless.

738
01:18:04,386 --> 01:18:10,175
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

739
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:15,678
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

740
01:18:16,774 --> 01:18:19,810
We will catch them off-balance.

741
01:18:20,027 --> 01:18:23,895
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

742
01:18:24,031 --> 01:18:27,400
Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.

743
01:18:28,119 --> 01:18:32,865
Only then will you be strong
enough with the dark side...

744
01:18:32,999 --> 01:18:34,992
to save Padmé.

745
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:39,959
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

746
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:43,174
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

747
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:48,345
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

748
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:51,142
go to the Mustafar system.

749
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:54,518
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

750
01:18:54,646 --> 01:18:58,062
and the other
separatist leaders.

751
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:04,065
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

752
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,032
And...

753
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:12,236
we shall have... peace.

754
01:19:55,459 --> 01:19:57,333
Sergeant, over here!

755
01:19:58,379 --> 01:20:00,288
Hurry! All of them!

756
01:20:03,092 --> 01:20:04,966
All Red units, let's move it!

757
01:20:05,094 --> 01:20:06,968
Come on. Let's go!

758
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:22,853
Commander, contact your troops.

759
01:20:22,987 --> 01:20:24,896
Tell them to move
to the higher levels.

760
01:20:25,031 --> 01:20:26,905
Very good, sir.

761
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:29,156
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

762
01:20:29,994 --> 01:20:33,529
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

763
01:20:33,665 --> 01:20:34,828
Yes, sir.

764
01:20:41,631 --> 01:20:43,090
Commander Cody...

765
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,086
the time has come.

766
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,467
Execute order 66.

767
01:20:52,226 --> 01:20:54,135
Yes, my lord.

768
01:20:58,023 --> 01:20:59,351
Blast him!

769
01:21:26,344 --> 01:21:27,719
Come on!

770
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:21,433
Execute order 66.

771
01:22:22,443 --> 01:22:24,068
It will be done, my lord.

772
01:23:06,906 --> 01:23:08,863
It will be done, my lord.

773
01:23:45,738 --> 01:23:48,110
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

774
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:50,197
What are we going to do?

775
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:04,839
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

776
01:24:04,966 --> 01:24:08,050
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

777
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:40,327
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

778
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,033
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

779
01:24:43,839 --> 01:24:46,377
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

780
01:24:48,135 --> 01:24:50,092
And so it is.

781
01:24:54,225 --> 01:24:55,684
Get him!

782
01:25:13,244 --> 01:25:15,118
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

783
01:25:42,024 --> 01:25:44,942
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

784
01:25:45,069 --> 01:25:46,528
Yes, sir.

785
01:25:54,662 --> 01:25:56,536
Goodbye, Tarfful.

786
01:25:56,664 --> 01:25:58,621
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

787
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:03,333
Miss you I will.

788
01:26:40,376 --> 01:26:42,701
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

789
01:26:42,836 --> 01:26:45,125
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

790
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:52,795
Did you find Kenobi?

791
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:54,839
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

792
01:26:55,892 --> 01:26:58,217
Start loading your men on the ships.

793
01:26:58,352 --> 01:26:59,811
Move it.

794
01:27:33,138 --> 01:27:35,131
Emergency code 913.

795
01:27:35,265 --> 01:27:37,139
I have no contact
on any frequency.

796
01:27:39,895 --> 01:27:41,306
Master Kenobi.

797
01:27:41,438 --> 01:27:43,395
- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.

798
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:47,438
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

799
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:50,320
We have just rescued
Master Yoda.

800
01:27:50,448 --> 01:27:52,524
It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.

801
01:27:52,658 --> 01:27:54,781
We're sending you our coordinates.

802
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:04,417
Hush! Not so loud.

803
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:07,546
Are you all right? I heard there
was an attack on the Jedi temple.

804
01:28:07,674 --> 01:28:10,046
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

805
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:12,050
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.

806
01:28:12,178 --> 01:28:13,803
What's happening?

807
01:28:14,681 --> 01:28:16,757
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

808
01:28:17,517 --> 01:28:19,391
I can't believe that.

809
01:28:19,519 --> 01:28:23,054
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

810
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:27,650
What are you gonna do?

811
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:38,528
I will not betray the Republic.

812
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,450
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

813
01:28:43,627 --> 01:28:46,332
and with the senate
and with you.

814
01:28:47,131 --> 01:28:50,334
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

815
01:28:51,093 --> 01:28:53,169
Many Jedi have been killed.

816
01:28:53,304 --> 01:28:56,139
We can only hope that he's
remained loyal to the chancellor.

817
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:59,550
Anakin, I'm afraid.

818
01:29:02,564 --> 01:29:04,604
Have faith, my love.

819
01:29:04,732 --> 01:29:07,021
Everything will soon be set right.

820
01:29:07,819 --> 01:29:10,903
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

821
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:13,866
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

822
01:29:14,618 --> 01:29:18,450
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

823
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:20,952
Things will be different.
I promise.

824
01:29:26,797 --> 01:29:28,754
Please, wait for me.

825
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:35,550
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

826
01:29:37,808 --> 01:29:39,717
Take care, my little friend.

827
01:29:44,023 --> 01:29:47,688
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?

828
01:29:47,818 --> 01:29:50,356
No, thank you, 3PO.

829
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:55,148
I feel so helpless.

830
01:30:18,725 --> 01:30:21,346
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

831
01:30:21,478 --> 01:30:24,016
Heard from no one have we.

832
01:30:24,898 --> 01:30:27,982
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

833
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:29,984
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

834
01:30:30,112 --> 01:30:32,520
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

835
01:30:32,656 --> 01:30:35,610
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

836
01:30:36,493 --> 01:30:39,743
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

837
01:30:39,872 --> 01:30:43,288
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

838
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:46,916
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

839
01:30:48,089 --> 01:30:51,838
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

840
01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:54,673
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

841
01:30:55,805 --> 01:30:57,347
I agree.

842
01:30:57,473 --> 01:31:01,056
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

843
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,456
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

844
01:31:25,586 --> 01:31:28,338
You have done well, Viceroy.

845
01:31:28,464 --> 01:31:34,253
When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...

846
01:31:34,386 --> 01:31:37,885
he will take care of you.

847
01:31:50,278 --> 01:31:52,650
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

848
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:54,689
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:31:56,451 --> 01:32:01,113
Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...

850
01:32:01,247 --> 01:32:03,204
at a special session of Congress.

851
01:32:03,333 --> 01:32:06,868
- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.

852
01:32:09,881 --> 01:32:13,131
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

853
01:32:13,260 --> 01:32:16,344
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

854
01:32:16,471 --> 01:32:18,380
without keeping
the senate intact.

855
01:32:19,224 --> 01:32:22,510
If a special session
of Congress there is...

856
01:32:22,644 --> 01:32:25,930
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

857
01:33:04,437 --> 01:33:06,394
R2, stay with the ship.

858
01:33:31,841 --> 01:33:34,842
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

859
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:11,206
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.

860
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:12,371
What's happened?

861
01:34:12,507 --> 01:34:17,003
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

862
01:34:17,137 --> 01:34:22,594
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

863
01:34:38,409 --> 01:34:40,865
Not even the younglings survived.

864
01:34:41,996 --> 01:34:47,335
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

865
01:34:48,378 --> 01:34:50,999
By a light sabre he was.

866
01:34:57,887 --> 01:34:59,429
Who?

867
01:34:59,556 --> 01:35:01,430
Who could have done this?

868
01:35:12,152 --> 01:35:15,319
The attempt on my life...

869
01:35:15,447 --> 01:35:20,323
has left me scarred and deformed.

870
01:35:21,287 --> 01:35:24,158
But I assure you.

871
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:28,999
My resolve has never been stronger!

872
01:35:33,215 --> 01:35:34,413
Stop!

873
01:35:47,397 --> 01:35:53,020
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

874
01:35:53,153 --> 01:35:57,021
the Republic will be reorganised...

875
01:35:57,157 --> 01:36:02,614
into the first Galactic Empire!

876
01:36:03,538 --> 01:36:09,374
For a safe and secure society.

877
01:36:18,804 --> 01:36:20,844
So this is how liberty dies.

878
01:36:21,599 --> 01:36:24,304
With thunderous applause.

879
01:36:26,729 --> 01:36:28,887
The war is over.

880
01:36:29,023 --> 01:36:33,151
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want ―

881
01:36:41,286 --> 01:36:45,948
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

882
01:36:46,082 --> 01:36:48,490
For the clones...

883
01:36:48,626 --> 01:36:52,706
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

884
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,519
Wait. Master.

885
01:37:08,063 --> 01:37:10,388
There is something I must know.

886
01:37:16,530 --> 01:37:20,943
If into the security recordings
you go, only pain will you find.

887
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:23,614
I must know the truth, Master.

888
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,329
It can't be.

889
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:35,338
It can't be.

890
01:37:35,466 --> 01:37:39,511
You have done well,
my new apprentice.

891
01:37:39,637 --> 01:37:42,638
Now, Lord Vader...

892
01:37:42,765 --> 01:37:46,264
go and bring peace to the Empire.

893
01:37:46,394 --> 01:37:48,552
I can't watch any more.

894
01:37:49,314 --> 01:37:53,228
Destroy the Sith we must.

895
01:37:55,028 --> 01:37:57,104
Send me to kill the emperor.

896
01:37:57,239 --> 01:37:59,481
I will not kill Anakin.

897
01:37:59,616 --> 01:38:04,325
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

898
01:38:04,454 --> 01:38:07,704
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

899
01:38:08,459 --> 01:38:13,501
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

900
01:38:13,631 --> 01:38:17,000
The boy you trained, gone he is.

901
01:38:17,134 --> 01:38:20,005
Consumed by Darth Vader.

902
01:38:20,137 --> 01:38:23,138
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

903
01:38:23,265 --> 01:38:25,471
I don't know where to look.

904
01:38:26,811 --> 01:38:30,476
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

905
01:38:41,034 --> 01:38:43,027
When was the last time
you saw him?

906
01:38:43,745 --> 01:38:47,114
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

907
01:38:50,293 --> 01:38:53,627
Padmé, I need your help.

908
01:38:54,339 --> 01:38:56,960
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

909
01:38:57,759 --> 01:38:59,218
From himself.

910
01:39:03,682 --> 01:39:06,054
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

911
01:39:06,185 --> 01:39:09,636
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

912
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:17,436
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...

913
01:39:19,073 --> 01:39:20,781
killing younglings.

914
01:39:20,908 --> 01:39:23,944
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

915
01:39:24,704 --> 01:39:26,993
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

916
01:39:27,874 --> 01:39:31,623
It appears that the chancellor is
behind everything, including the war.

917
01:39:33,463 --> 01:39:36,168
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

918
01:39:36,299 --> 01:39:40,379
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

919
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:48,558
I don't believe you.

920
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:51,439
I can't.

921
01:39:59,656 --> 01:40:01,898
I must find him.

922
01:40:04,036 --> 01:40:06,361
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

923
01:40:10,084 --> 01:40:12,540
He has become
a very great threat.

924
01:40:15,172 --> 01:40:16,631
I can't.

925
01:40:30,355 --> 01:40:32,264
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

926
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:38,651
I'm so sorry.

927
01:41:24,786 --> 01:41:26,909
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

928
01:41:27,038 --> 01:41:28,995
The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

929
01:41:29,123 --> 01:41:31,495
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

930
01:41:31,626 --> 01:41:35,244
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

931
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:37,752
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

932
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,469
Oh, dear.

933
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:57,058
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

934
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,847
The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.

935
01:42:28,977 --> 01:42:31,848
It is finished then.

936
01:42:33,273 --> 01:42:39,062
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

937
01:42:39,863 --> 01:42:44,075
Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.

938
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:49,371
All droid units
must shut down immediately.

939
01:42:50,248 --> 01:42:52,205
Very good, my lord.

940
01:43:51,478 --> 01:43:53,554
I saw your ship.

941
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:59,401
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

942
01:44:00,863 --> 01:44:03,698
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

943
01:44:03,824 --> 01:44:05,366
What things?

944
01:44:06,077 --> 01:44:08,995
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

945
01:44:09,121 --> 01:44:13,748
That you... killed younglings.

946
01:44:15,294 --> 01:44:17,963
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

947
01:44:18,089 --> 01:44:19,963
He cares about us.

948
01:44:20,675 --> 01:44:21,838
Us?

949
01:44:21,968 --> 01:44:23,427
He knows.

950
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:26,678
He wants to help you.

951
01:44:30,518 --> 01:44:33,768
Anakin, all I want is your love.

952
01:44:33,897 --> 01:44:36,222
Love won't save you, Padmé.

953
01:44:36,358 --> 01:44:39,561
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

954
01:44:39,694 --> 01:44:42,066
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

955
01:44:42,197 --> 01:44:44,902
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.

956
01:44:45,033 --> 01:44:49,245
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

957
01:44:49,371 --> 01:44:52,158
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

958
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:55,457
Come away with me.

959
01:44:56,211 --> 01:44:58,204
Help me raise our child.

960
01:44:58,339 --> 01:45:01,126
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

961
01:45:01,258 --> 01:45:05,172
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.

962
01:45:06,013 --> 01:45:08,504
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

963
01:45:09,559 --> 01:45:11,468
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

964
01:45:11,602 --> 01:45:13,678
I can overthrow him.

965
01:45:15,773 --> 01:45:18,809
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...

966
01:45:18,943 --> 01:45:21,351
make things the way
we want them to be.

967
01:45:27,702 --> 01:45:29,695
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

968
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:34,492
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

969
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:39,546
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

970
01:45:40,424 --> 01:45:43,840
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

971
01:45:45,554 --> 01:45:47,547
I don't know you any more.

972
01:45:51,268 --> 01:45:53,225
You're breaking my heart.

973
01:45:53,938 --> 01:45:56,892
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

974
01:45:57,900 --> 01:45:59,774
Because of Obi-Wan?

975
01:46:00,569 --> 01:46:02,645
Because of what you've done.

976
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:04,689
What you plan to do.

977
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:08,571
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

978
01:46:08,703 --> 01:46:11,621
- I love you.
- Liar!

979
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:20,210
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

980
01:46:21,674 --> 01:46:23,252
Let her go, Anakin.

981
01:46:26,471 --> 01:46:28,629
Let her go.

982
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:40,643
You turned her against me!

983
01:46:42,279 --> 01:46:44,437
You have done that yourself.

984
01:46:49,203 --> 01:46:51,361
You will not
take her from me!

985
01:46:51,497 --> 01:46:55,329
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

986
01:46:59,296 --> 01:47:03,625
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

987
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,386
until now you have become the
very thing you swore to destroy.

988
01:47:08,514 --> 01:47:10,388
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

989
01:47:10,516 --> 01:47:13,007
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

990
01:47:14,145 --> 01:47:16,517
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.

991
01:47:18,358 --> 01:47:20,267
I have brought peace...

992
01:47:20,401 --> 01:47:25,147
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

993
01:47:26,157 --> 01:47:28,280
Your new empire?

994
01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:31,159
Don't make me kill you.

995
01:47:32,539 --> 01:47:37,035
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

996
01:47:37,919 --> 01:47:39,876
If you're not with me...

997
01:47:40,797 --> 01:47:42,671
then you're my enemy.

998
01:47:44,718 --> 01:47:47,174
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

999
01:47:49,723 --> 01:47:51,597
I will do what I must.

1000
01:47:52,309 --> 01:47:54,681
You will try.

1001
01:48:26,469 --> 01:48:30,467
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1002
01:48:30,599 --> 01:48:35,060
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1003
01:48:35,187 --> 01:48:37,760
Master Yoda.

1004
01:48:37,898 --> 01:48:39,558
You survived.

1005
01:48:40,442 --> 01:48:41,817
Surprised?

1006
01:48:42,528 --> 01:48:47,107
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1007
01:48:47,241 --> 01:48:49,281
Now you will experience...

1008
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:53,871
the full power of the dark side.

1009
01:49:35,832 --> 01:49:41,502
I have waited a long time
for this moment...

1010
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:46,791
my little green friend.

1011
01:49:57,021 --> 01:50:00,472
At last the Jedi are no more.

1012
01:50:00,608 --> 01:50:04,820
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1013
01:50:10,159 --> 01:50:12,484
At an end your rule is.

1014
01:50:14,372 --> 01:50:16,828
And not short enough it was.

1015
01:50:21,588 --> 01:50:23,794
If so powerful you are...

1016
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:26,509
why leave?

1017
01:50:27,469 --> 01:50:30,007
You will not stop me.

1018
01:50:30,138 --> 01:50:34,717
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1019
01:50:34,852 --> 01:50:39,181
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1020
01:50:40,524 --> 01:50:44,569
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1021
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,925
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1022
01:55:15,057 --> 01:55:17,844
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1023
01:55:17,976 --> 01:55:20,301
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1024
01:55:20,437 --> 01:55:24,055
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1025
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:26,433
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1026
01:55:27,528 --> 01:55:31,608
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my
shuttle for immediate take-off.

1027
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:36,817
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1028
01:56:45,650 --> 01:56:48,817
Into exile I must go.

1029
01:56:49,529 --> 01:56:51,605
Failed I have.

1030
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:32,959
I have failed you, Anakin.

1031
01:58:33,094 --> 01:58:34,968
I have failed you.

1032
01:58:35,096 --> 01:58:37,967
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1033
01:58:38,099 --> 01:58:40,886
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1034
01:58:41,018 --> 01:58:43,639
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1035
01:58:43,771 --> 01:58:45,349
Then you are lost!

1036
01:58:57,243 --> 01:58:59,734
This is the end for you, my master.

1037
01:59:24,271 --> 01:59:27,391
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1038
01:59:30,069 --> 01:59:32,738
You underestimate my power.

1039
01:59:33,531 --> 01:59:35,239
Don't try it.

1040
01:59:58,139 --> 02:00:00,096
You were the chosen one!

1041
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:04,768
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1042
02:00:07,441 --> 02:00:11,225
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1043
02:00:22,915 --> 02:00:25,240
I hate you!

1044
02:00:32,675 --> 02:00:34,964
You were my brother, Anakin.

1045
02:00:37,013 --> 02:00:39,338
I loved you.

1046
02:01:20,391 --> 02:01:23,309
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1047
02:01:23,436 --> 02:01:25,512
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1048
02:01:25,646 --> 02:01:28,481
We should leave this dreadful place.

1049
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:45,997
Is Anakin all right?

1050
02:02:54,821 --> 02:02:56,778
Your Majesty, this way.

1051
02:02:57,741 --> 02:02:59,615
There he is.

1052
02:02:59,743 --> 02:03:01,901
He's still alive.

1053
02:03:04,915 --> 02:03:07,121
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1054
02:03:07,251 --> 02:03:09,208
Yes, sir. Right away.

1055
02:03:45,206 --> 02:03:47,115
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1056
02:03:53,048 --> 02:03:55,206
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1057
02:04:12,067 --> 02:04:14,475
We'll take her to
the medical centre. Quickly.

1058
02:04:44,809 --> 02:04:47,015
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1059
02:04:47,145 --> 02:04:50,348
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1060
02:04:51,733 --> 02:04:54,438
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1061
02:04:54,569 --> 02:04:56,609
She has lost the will to live.

1062
02:04:56,738 --> 02:04:59,858
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1063
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:01,570
Babies?

1064
02:05:01,702 --> 02:05:03,576
She's carrying twins.

1065
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:47,206
Luke.

1066
02:05:55,424 --> 02:05:56,883
Oh, Luke.

1067
02:06:19,365 --> 02:06:21,690
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1068
02:07:04,203 --> 02:07:05,486
Obi-Wan...

1069
02:07:11,168 --> 02:07:13,042
There's good in him.

1070
02:07:15,756 --> 02:07:17,131
I know.

1071
02:07:17,842 --> 02:07:21,425
I know there's... still ―

1072
02:07:56,674 --> 02:07:58,133
Lord Vader.

1073
02:07:59,468 --> 02:08:01,591
Can you hear me?

1074
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:06,099
Yes, Master.

1075
02:08:09,228 --> 02:08:11,102
Where is Padmé?

1076
02:08:12,940 --> 02:08:14,814
Is she safe?

1077
02:08:15,943 --> 02:08:17,936
Is she all right?

1078
02:08:19,656 --> 02:08:24,199
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1079
02:08:25,245 --> 02:08:28,116
I? I couldn't have.

1080
02:08:28,248 --> 02:08:31,249
She was alive. I felt it!

1081
02:09:05,202 --> 02:09:08,820
Hidden, safe the children
must be kept.

1082
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:14,160
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1083
02:09:16,714 --> 02:09:18,837
Split up they should be.

1084
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:21,459
My wife and I will take the girl.

1085
02:09:23,054 --> 02:09:25,925
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1086
02:09:26,057 --> 02:09:28,299
She will be loved with us.

1087
02:09:29,227 --> 02:09:31,184
And what of the boy?

1088
02:09:32,147 --> 02:09:35,646
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1089
02:09:37,486 --> 02:09:39,894
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1090
02:09:45,369 --> 02:09:49,034
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1091
02:09:50,874 --> 02:09:54,457
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1092
02:09:56,005 --> 02:10:01,212
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1093
02:10:02,553 --> 02:10:03,833
Training?

1094
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:08,550
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1095
02:10:10,603 --> 02:10:13,687
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1096
02:10:13,815 --> 02:10:16,223
Your old master.

1097
02:10:16,943 --> 02:10:18,402
Qui-Gon?

1098
02:10:20,947 --> 02:10:24,197
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1099
02:10:25,702 --> 02:10:27,825
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1100
02:10:27,954 --> 02:10:29,828
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1101
02:10:29,956 --> 02:10:31,830
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1102
02:10:31,958 --> 02:10:33,832
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1103
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,419
What?

1
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,646
Ahsoka Tano on the run!

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,689
After an attack on the Jedi Temple,

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,984
Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan
found herself accused

4
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,487
of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.

5
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:30,697
With no choice but to run,

6
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:34,201
she was chased by her master,
who begged her to turn herself in.

7
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,872
Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,

8
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:44,211
Ahsoka decided to find out the truth
and prove her innocence on her own.

9
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,259
After further investigation,

10
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,554
there can be little doubt that
the clone officers murdered in the escape

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,181
were killed by none other
than Ahsoka Tano herself.

12
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,685
She used a Jedi mind-trick to convince
the clone to open the door,

13
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:04,231
and then proceeded to cut him down,
along with five other clones along the way.

14
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:09,736
I do not believe that Ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

15
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,865
The beliefs of the Jedi Council
are irrelevant.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,284
We deal strictly in facts and evidence,

17
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,580
and the evidence points to Padawan Tano
being guilty of the attack on the Temple

18
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,582
and the murder of the Republic officers.

19
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,584
This is sedition.

20
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:32,050
Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your Padawan before she escaped?

21
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,636
No, Master Mundi.

22
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,765
The Council believes that Ahsoka
may be guilty of the crime.

23
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,310
Still believe they are wrong, do you? Hmm?

24
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,937
I believe she didn't kill the clone troopers

25
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,940
or the woman who used the nano-droids
to blow up the Temple.

26
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:50,235
That's why she's running.
To prove her innocence.

27
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,741
Now she's in the lower depths.
With her skills, she will be hard to find.

28
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,743
Two teams we will send.

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:02,664
Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon,
with clones you will go.

30
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:06,793
I think it would be best
if Skywalker stayed here.

31
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,297
Having you involved may actually
make things worse.

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:16,512
Master Windu, with all due respect,
she is my Padawan.

33
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:19,640
The reason for you not to go.

34
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,227
I think we're being foolish
if we take Anakin off this mission.

35
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,520
Who knows her better?

36
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,146
He's emotionally tied to her.

37
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,982
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

38
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:33,070
I'd rather capture Ahsoka and find out
the truth than let her run because of a lie.

39
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,866
You must prove to us that you will
stay focused, can you?

40
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,577
I've already alerted
security on the lower levels

41
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,246
to be on the lookout for Ahsoka.

42
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,335
Go swiftly then, Skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

43
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,712
before it is too late.

44
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,006
Yes, Master.

45
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,210
This one just came in.

46
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,547
Looks like the Jedi are after one
of their own.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,799
She's armed and dangerous. Alert all units.

48
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,094
You heard him.

49
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,239
Barriss, it's Ahsoka.

50
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,742
Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe.

51
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,911
Safe, but on the run.

52
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,245
Where?

53
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,749
I can't tell you, but someone
is definitely trying to frame me.

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,960
It's not safe for you to call me using
the Jedi communicator.

55
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,795
Find another way to contact me.

56
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,088
I will.

57
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,757
In the meantime, I'll do some digging

58
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,635
and see if I can find anything out
to help you on my end.

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,761
Thank you, Barriss.

60
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,137
Be safe.

61
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,943
Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

62
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,945
Yeah.

63
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:39,947
Let's make a trade.

64
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,118
What do you want?

65
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,704
Your cloak.

66
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,622
Passes, please. Passes, please.

67
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,212
Passes, please.

68
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,432
That's her! The rogue Jedi!

69
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,482
All units respond.
We have located the rogue Jedi.

70
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,327
Stop her!

71
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,038
I've got her!

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,020
Sir, look!

73
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,815
Stop!

74
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,369
Not good.

75
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,795
Don't worry, little guy. I'll get us out of this.

76
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,802
I'll think of something.
Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof.

77
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,808
Almost there.

78
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,935
Almost... Got it!

79
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,822
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

80
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
Thanks, kid. I owe you one.

81
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,945
The lower level police claim
to have spotted Commander Tano

82
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,822
heading to level 1312.

83
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,699
All right, let's bring her home.

84
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:52,282
Well, well. I didn't believe it when
I first heard it, but I guess it's true.

85
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,869
The Senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

86
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,749
And I'm going to be the one who collects.

87
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,126
Ventress! It was you, wasn't it?

88
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,839
You were behind all of this
and you framed me!

89
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,384
I don't know what you're talking about.

90
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,719
Yes, you do!

91
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,974
So, what are you now? A bounty hunter?

92
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,144
Yes. And someone who knows how
to make easy money.

93
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,699
You think you're just going
to hand me over,

94
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,743
and then what? Get a pat on the shoulder?

95
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,079
You're a Separatist war criminal and a Sith.

96
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,832
They'll have us both in prison
before you've said your name.

97
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,334
I don't have to hand you over to the Jedi.

98
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:47,671
I can hand you over to the bondsmen
and still get paid.

99
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,508
I'm going to get my money,
whether you're dead or alive.

100
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:56,430
Good luck.
Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi.

101
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:00,434
I'm afraid the other Jedi
no longer see it that way.

102
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,937
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

103
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,815
That's why I'm going to need your help.

104
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:11,653
In what star system do you think
I would ever help you?

105
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,948
A traitorous Jedi tried
to blow up the Jedi Temple

106
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,659
and has framed me for that
and other killings.

107
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:21,455
Hmm. So, the Jedi aren't that holy after all.

108
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:26,793
I know Dooku tried to have you killed.
I know he betrayed you.

109
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,670
What if this is his new apprentice?

110
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,799
I've fallen from my path,
just as you've fallen from yours.

111
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:35,302
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

112
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,847
What can you offer me
that's better than money?

113
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:41,475
If you help me,

114
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,686
I'll speak to the Council and the Senate
on your behalf.

115
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,481
I'll get you a full pardon for your crimes.

116
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:51,944
You have my attention.
But I'm going to go where the tide flows.

117
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,822
If the tide is flowing against you,

118
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,992
don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,328
Fair enough.

120
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,623
I suggest we find somewhere else
to discuss this.

121
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,877
Shine the light over there.

122
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,839
Stay where you are!

123
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,528
Ventress.

124
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,491
Send out the probes.
I want them found now!

125
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,503
Nice place you have here.

126
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:56,508
Not everyone on Coruscant lives
in a luxurious temple on the surface.

127
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:59,178
I guess I'll have to get used to that.

128
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,013
Just make the call.

129
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:11,899
Adding another criminal act to your record?

130
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,568
I don't want them to be able to trace it.

131
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,321
Barriss, it's me.

132
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,159
It's so good to see you, Ahsoka.
Are you okay?

133
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,702
Yeah, I'm okay,

134
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:27,498
if you consider Anakin and 100 clones
on my tail a good space to be in.

135
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:28,832
You were almost captured?

136
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,042
Once or twice, yeah.

137
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,418
Where are you?

138
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,837
I can't say, Barriss.

139
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,756
I believe I've found a clue.

140
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,800
A clue? How? From where?

141
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,052
We don't have much time, Ahsoka.

142
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,474
Fine, I'm on level 1312.

143
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,065
A holobooth at the corner
of 12th and G. Got it.

144
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,235
Three levels up, there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

145
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:58,403
where they used to build munitions
that Letta visited

146
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,156
during the time she was getting access
to the nano-droids.

147
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,616
How did you find this out?

148
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,993
I told you I would do some checking.

149
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,079
Oh, thank you, Barriss.

150
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,206
Be careful, Ahsoka.

151
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,462
Well?

152
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,006
I think I have a lead.

153
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,432
It doesn't seem like you need my help.

154
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:28,809
That's not true.

155
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:32,396
We need to find an abandoned
munitions warehouse on level 1315.

156
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:35,065
We should be able to find
some information there.

157
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:40,821
You know the place I'm talking about,
don't you?

158
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:43,490
Yes, I can get you there.

159
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,792
Listen to me. I don't want to fight.

160
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:56,753
I do.

161
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,881
We're taking you in now, Commander.

162
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:02,217
That's not gonna happen, trust me.

163
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,053
Now, I'm not going to hurt any of you...

164
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,140
We're not going to hurt any of you,

165
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,684
but you're not taking me in.

166
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,105
Commander, we are taking you in.

167
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,608
Let's play.

168
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,734
Take them out!

169
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,320
Ventress, don't!

170
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,740
Look out!

171
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,481
See?

172
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,399
Didn't kill one.

173
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,485
It's the new me.

174
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,283
General Plo Koon,
we had Commander Tano

175
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,495
but she escaped with the help
of Asajj Ventress.

176
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,420
There it is.

177
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,674
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

178
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,936
I've done my part of the bargain

179
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,355
which means you're on your own
from here.

180
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,317
But, don't forget you have
to speak on my behalf now.

181
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,486
- That was the deal.
- Agreed.

182
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,115
Thanks for getting me this far at least.

183
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:49,950
I have to admit,

184
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:54,788
I never saw us doing
anything together ever.

185
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,749
These are strange times.

186
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,990
I thought we decided we were going
to part ways?

187
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:45,547
Ah!

188
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,209
How am I supposed to find a clue

189
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:24,211
when I don't even know
what I'm looking for?

190
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,608
Ventress!
I see you've had a change of heart.

191
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,082
Why bring me here?

192
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,002
Answer me, Ventress! Why?

193
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,068
Calling all units,

194
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,820
suspicious activity on level 1315.

195
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:05,372
Nano-droids?

196
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:15,048
No! Wolffe, let me explain!

197
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:32,024
Explosives.

198
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:36,528
These are the same types of nano-droids
that were used to blow up the Jedi Temple.

199
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:38,780
I can't believe it.

200
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,415
Captured, she has been?

201
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,250
Yes, Master Yoda.

202
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,960
Without incident?

203
00:20:52,044 --> 00:20:55,005
No. She was subdued by the clones

204
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,217
and found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

205
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:01,845
It still doesn't explain
Ventress' involvement.

206
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,472
We saw her with Ahsoka.

207
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,517
I think there's more going on
than we know.

208
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,977
By Ahsoka or against her?

209
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,105
That remains to be seen.

210
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,774
We're bringing her back to the Temple.

211
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:16,527
Let's just hope we can keep her here.

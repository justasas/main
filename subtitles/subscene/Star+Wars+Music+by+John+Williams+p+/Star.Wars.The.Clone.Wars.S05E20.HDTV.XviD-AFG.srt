00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:18,871
Male announcer:
Ahsoka Tano captured!

3
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,973
While on the run to prove her innocence,

4
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:24,210
Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress

5
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:28,180
to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.

6
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:30,582
The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker

7
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,586
and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down

8
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:35,754
and bring her back to the Temple.

9
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:37,556
Now captured and imprisoned,

10
00:00:37,624 --> 00:00:42,294
Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.

11
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,164
The Senate requests
that Ahsoka Tano be indicted

12
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:48,067
for acts of treason
against the Republic.

13
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:51,036
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have

14
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:53,406
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

15
00:00:53,474 --> 00:00:56,076
Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.

16
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,744
I'm afraid, Master Yoda,

17
00:00:57,812 --> 00:01:01,281
that the Senate believes
that an internal Jedi trial

18
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:03,517
would seem biased.

19
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,152
Therefore, the Senate asks

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,057
that the Council expel
Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order

21
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,893
so that she may be put
to a Republic Military tribunal,

22
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:15,297
where she will receive
more impartial judgment.

23
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:20,036
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

24
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:22,705
That would be up
to the Council, General,

25
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,875
but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.

26
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:27,476
Of course.

27
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:31,080
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

28
00:01:31,148 --> 00:01:34,784
Thank you, Admiral.

29
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:37,787
Surely we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

30
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:40,289
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

31
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,591
And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

32
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,460
the mastermind behind the attack
on the Temple.

33
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:50,131
She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

34
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,434
This alone is enough to convict her.

35
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,202
I understand your sentiment,
Obi-Wan,

36
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,805
but if the Council does as you suggest,

37
00:01:57,873 --> 00:01:59,741
it could be seen as an act of opposition

38
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,342
to the Senate.

39
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,879
I'm afraid we have little choice.

40
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:06,714
Hmm.

41
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,249
To the Chamber of Judgment,

42
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:10,951
summon Skywalker and his Padawan,

43
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,955
and in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

44
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:17,958
[dramatic music]

45
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,704
You're not helping.

46
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:32,105
[groans]

47
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:33,940
I'm sorry, Snips.

48
00:02:34,008 --> 00:02:36,742
I just--I just don't know
what to do.

49
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,843
It's okay.

50
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,111
I don't either.

51
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,146
[chime resounds]

52
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,683
Padawan Tano,

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,986
serious charges
have been levied against you.

54
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,822
How plead you?

55
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,423
Not guilty, Master.

56
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:29,226
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

57
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:32,196
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

58
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:34,433
There is evidence to the contrary.

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,869
You were alone with
Letta Turmond when she died.

60
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:38,670
Can you explain this?

61
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,472
Someone used the Force against her.

62
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,174
Which brings us to Ventress.

63
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,677
Can you explain your association
with her?

64
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:48,646
We had a mutual understanding.

65
00:03:48,714 --> 00:03:50,048
I thought she was helping me.

66
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,083
Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

67
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,518
found when you were apprehended,

68
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:55,753
the same devices used
in the bombing of the Temple?

69
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,390
No, I was set up and deceived,

70
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:01,526
as you are being deceived now.

71
00:04:01,593 --> 00:04:03,795
The question is, Padawan Tano,

72
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:05,830
who is deceiving us?

73
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:08,299
Ventress, you, or someone else?

74
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:10,234
I am not deceiving you.

75
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:12,537
I would assume Ventress is,

76
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,105
but I can't be sure.

77
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,907
My sense is clouded.

78
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,709
Clouded by the dark side

79
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,910
these things are, Padawan Tano.

80
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,812
Dangerously clouded,

81
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,848
but not just surrounding you,

82
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,717
surrounding many things in these times.

83
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,486
You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

84
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:33,889
This meeting is just a formality!

85
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:34,890
[sighs]

86
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:37,326
Reached a decision, we have,

87
00:04:37,393 --> 00:04:40,162
though not in total agreement are we.

88
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,398
It is the Council's opinion

89
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:44,700
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano
has committed sedition

90
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,168
against the Republic,

91
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:51,707
and thus, she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

92
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:53,142
You can't do this!

93
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,211
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

94
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:58,581
and you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

95
00:04:58,648 --> 00:05:01,350
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

96
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,452
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts

97
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,987
to await your trail

98
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,857
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

99
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:12,460
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

100
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,871
[door whooshes]

101
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:30,378
PadmÃ© has agreed to represent
you before the Senate.

102
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:33,782
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

103
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,184
I am almost certain
that the person behind this

104
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,386
is Ventress,

105
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:39,889
and you know I wasn't working with her.

106
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:41,557
She was at the warehouse...

107
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:42,558
in the room.

108
00:05:42,626 --> 00:05:45,161
We fought, but she got away.

109
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,466
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

110
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:52,202
No, none of the clones
reported seeing Ventress

111
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,771
at the scene.

112
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,139
I thought you said Ventress left

113
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,907
before you went into the warehouse.

114
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:58,409
That's what I thought, too,

115
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,845
but then she attacked me
when I got inside.

116
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,447
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

117
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:07,251
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

118
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,287
Wait, where are you going?

119
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:10,788
You can't leave now.

120
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,990
Yes, I can.

121
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:17,194
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

122
00:06:17,262 --> 00:06:19,363
Until we hear from Anakin,

123
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,065
let's work on your defense.

124
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,266
[sighs]

125
00:06:22,334 --> 00:06:24,568
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

126
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:27,070
I thought I was part of that Order,

127
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,640
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

128
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,908
I'm not holding out much hope

129
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:33,877
the Senate will treat me any better.

130
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,435
Anakin Skywalker.

131
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,467
I know you're behind all of this.

132
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,254
Prove it.

133
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,556
[intense orchestral music]

134
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,627
[both grunting]

135
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,966
Leave me alone.

136
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,034
[grunts]

137
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:46,711
[choking and gagging]

138
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,279
Tell me what happened.

139
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:49,981
[choking and gasping]

140
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,984
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

141
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:55,986
I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

142
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,721
Bounty?

143
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,490
I was going to catch your pet

144
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:01,892
and turn her over to the authorities,

145
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,697
collect whatever bounty was due.

146
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:06,765
What stopped you?

147
00:08:06,832 --> 00:08:09,334
[coughing]

148
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:13,439
At first--I admit--I was
just interested in the money

149
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,775
and a little bit of revenge,

150
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:19,245
but then I realized
your fallen Padawan and I

151
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:21,714
had a lot in common.

152
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:24,785
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

153
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:27,153
It's true.

154
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:30,657
My master abandoned me,

155
00:08:30,724 --> 00:08:35,628
and that's exactly what you did to her,

156
00:08:35,696 --> 00:08:39,465
you and your precious Jedi Order.

157
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:52,812
[suspenseful orchestral music]

158
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,133
[staff clanging]

159
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:36,254
Ahsoka Tano,

160
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:38,390
you have been charged with sedition

161
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:43,095
against the Jedi Order
and the Republic itself.

162
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,632
This court will decide your fate.

163
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:50,702
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

164
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,942
Former Padawan Tano,

165
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,644
I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

166
00:09:58,712 --> 00:10:01,481
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple

167
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:04,484
and that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

168
00:10:04,552 --> 00:10:07,487
you eliminated them one by one.

169
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:09,155
When you are found guilty,

170
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:11,691
I ask the court
that the full extent of the law

171
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:13,227
be brought down upon you,

172
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:16,162
including penalty of death.

173
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,665
[dramatic musical flourish]

174
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:22,336
After I left the warehouse,

175
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,506
after I left your little Padawan alone,

176
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:26,874
I was walking away,

177
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:30,044
and I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

178
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:31,546
But I was wrong.

179
00:10:31,613 --> 00:10:34,815
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

180
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:37,952
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

181
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,321
It had to be another Jedi.

182
00:10:40,388 --> 00:10:41,689
I don't believe you.

183
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:43,023
Believe it.

184
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:46,026
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

185
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:48,194
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

186
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,295
[sighs]

187
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:51,297
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

188
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:55,267
You're the only one
Ahsoka had talked to.

189
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,202
That's not true.

190
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,071
What do you mean?

191
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:01,574
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

192
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:05,245
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

193
00:11:05,313 --> 00:11:07,214
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

194
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,582
in the first place.

195
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,487
It was this Barriss
that told us to go there.

196
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:15,323
If you're lying, you're dead.

197
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,558
Such promises.

198
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,963
Look at the facts.

199
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,699
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

200
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,834
to reveal the name
of the true mastermind

201
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:29,736
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

202
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,138
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

203
00:11:32,206 --> 00:11:35,008
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

204
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:37,644
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

205
00:11:37,712 --> 00:11:39,880
Letta Turmond was strangled to death

206
00:11:39,948 --> 00:11:41,482
by way of the Force.

207
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:44,051
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

208
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,020
with a method that would so obviously

209
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:47,889
tie the murder to her?

210
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,092
A Jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

211
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,296
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

212
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:55,864
Members of the court,

213
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:58,767
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

214
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,702
[clapping slowly]

215
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:04,172
Well said, Senator Amidala.

216
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:06,374
However, if she is innocent,

217
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,978
then why was she seen conspiring
with known Separatist terrorist

218
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:12,380
Asajj Ventress?

219
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:13,982
Ventress set me up.

220
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:15,917
My master will prove that.

221
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:18,153
And where is your master?

222
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,089
He's trying to find the real murderer.

223
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,193
Then maybe he should be looking at you.

224
00:12:49,011 --> 00:12:50,212
[electronic beep]

225
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,981
Enter.

226
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:56,084
Barriss, I need to talk to you.

227
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,653
Master Skywalker,

228
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,488
how can I help you?

229
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,623
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka

230
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:02,958
before she was arrested.

231
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,793
What did you say to her?

232
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,062
We've been friends for a long time.

233
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,964
I was only trying to help her.

234
00:13:09,031 --> 00:13:10,665
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

235
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,200
It's no trouble.

236
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:14,670
I just need to know what you told her

237
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:16,138
and if you told anyone else.

238
00:13:16,205 --> 00:13:19,041
No, I thought I had a clue for her,

239
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,009
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

240
00:13:21,077 --> 00:13:22,911
Who told you I spoke to her?

241
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:24,546
Ventress.

242
00:13:24,614 --> 00:13:26,115
She told me.

243
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:27,650
Ventress?

244
00:13:27,717 --> 00:13:30,586
Isn't she the one Ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

245
00:13:30,654 --> 00:13:32,322
That's what Ahsoka says,

246
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,591
but I think she's wrong.

247
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:37,027
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

248
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,928
And you believe her?

249
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,331
Who else could it be if not her?

250
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,666
Surely not Ahsoka.

251
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:46,937
No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either.

252
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:50,473
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth,

253
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,710
but there's only one way to find out.

254
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,182
Funny.
Those belong to Ventress.

255
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,451
[lightsabers whooshing, zapping]

256
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:02,852
You should've gotten rid of them!

257
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,622
I think they suit me.

258
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:06,856
[yelps]

259
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:09,225
[intense orchestral music]

260
00:14:09,293 --> 00:14:13,696
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi

261
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:17,333
and think, "Surely
she cannot be this murderer

262
00:14:17,401 --> 00:14:20,303
or saboteur that they speak of."

263
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,606
And yet think of all the times
we have been fooled

264
00:14:23,674 --> 00:14:25,541
by the Separatists

265
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,744
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic

266
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,946
and ask yourself,

267
00:14:30,014 --> 00:14:34,851
"Is this yet another
Separatist scheme?"

268
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:37,888
Another way to rip the Jedi,

269
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:40,825
and subsequently all of us,

270
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,460
apart.

271
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,031
[grunts]

272
00:14:47,099 --> 00:14:50,168
Ahsoka trusted you,
and you betrayed her.

273
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:51,903
I've learned that trust is overrated.

274
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,172
The only thing
the Jedi Council believes in

275
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,407
is violence.

276
00:14:55,475 --> 00:14:58,410
[lightsabers whooshing, crackling]

277
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:15,927
Cease hostility!

278
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,303
Barriss!

279
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,971
[glass shattering]

280
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:27,039
[grunts]

281
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:29,441
[lightsabers zapping]

282
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:37,750
[lightsabers zapping]

283
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:40,819
[screaming and grunting]

284
00:15:42,555 --> 00:15:43,555
Look out!

285
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,242
[lightsabers crackling intensely]

286
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:05,711
[grunts]

287
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:10,683
[grunting]

288
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:18,791
[groans]

289
00:16:18,859 --> 00:16:20,559
[whimpers]

290
00:16:24,898 --> 00:16:29,167
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

291
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:30,435
[device beeps]

292
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,611
Ahsoka Tano,

293
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:43,147
by an overwhelming count of--

294
00:16:43,215 --> 00:16:45,649
Chancellor.

295
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,885
I hope you have a reason

296
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,587
for bursting into our proceedings,

297
00:16:50,655 --> 00:16:52,890
Master Skywalker.

298
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,126
I'm here with evidence and a confession

299
00:16:56,194 --> 00:16:58,128
from the person responsible
for all the crimes

300
00:16:58,196 --> 00:17:01,131
Ahsoka has been accused of.

301
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,302
Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order

302
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,904
and traitor.

303
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,379
Barriss, is that true?

304
00:17:15,447 --> 00:17:17,381
Tell them the truth.

305
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,820
I did it

306
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,655
because I've come to realize

307
00:17:25,723 --> 00:17:27,190
what many of people in the Republic

308
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:28,691
have come to realize,

309
00:17:28,759 --> 00:17:31,594
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

310
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,329
that we've so lost our way

311
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,798
that we have become villains
in this conflict,

312
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,333
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

313
00:17:38,401 --> 00:17:40,502
all of us!

314
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,604
And my attack on the Temple
was an attack

315
00:17:42,672 --> 00:17:45,340
on what the Jedi have become,

316
00:17:45,407 --> 00:17:48,343
an army fighting for the dark side,

317
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:51,079
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

318
00:17:51,147 --> 00:17:54,382
This Republic is failing!

319
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,419
It's only a matter of time.

320
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,890
Take her away.

321
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,894
[melancholy orchestral music]

322
00:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,581
Ahsoka,

323
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:29,017
I am so sorry

324
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:33,322
about everything.

325
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,724
You have our most humble apologies,

326
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,626
little 'Soka.

327
00:18:37,694 --> 00:18:40,729
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

328
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:44,333
You have shown such
great strength and resilience

329
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,770
in your struggle
to prove your innocence.

330
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:51,140
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

331
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:54,110
This was actually your great trial.

332
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:56,078
Now we see that.

333
00:18:56,146 --> 00:18:58,848
We understand that the Force
works in mysterious ways,

334
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:00,616
and because of this trial,

335
00:19:00,684 --> 00:19:05,355
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

336
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:09,293
Back into the Order you may come.

337
00:19:11,196 --> 00:19:13,864
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

338
00:19:16,568 --> 00:19:19,737
I'm asking you back.

339
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:22,739
[dramatic orchestral music]

340
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:49,265
I'm sorry, Master,

341
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,901
but I'm not coming back.

342
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:54,904
[melancholy orchestral music]

343
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:26,903
Ahsoka, wait!

344
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,906
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

345
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:34,912
[sighs]

346
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,781
Why are you doing this?

347
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:39,984
The Council didn't trust me,

348
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:42,386
so how can I trust myself?

349
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:44,121
What about me?

350
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,758
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

351
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:49,660
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

352
00:20:49,728 --> 00:20:51,863
and I'm grateful for that.

353
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,099
But this isn't about you.

354
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,301
I can't stay here any longer,

355
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,270
not now.

356
00:20:59,338 --> 00:21:01,506
The Jedi Order is your life.

357
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,109
You can't just throw it away like this.

358
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,245
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

359
00:21:07,313 --> 00:21:11,450
Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

360
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:14,052
without the Council

361
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,920
and without you.

362
00:21:18,224 --> 00:21:19,758
I understand.

363
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:21,927
More than you realize,

364
00:21:21,995 --> 00:21:26,599
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

365
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,570
I know.

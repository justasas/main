1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,273
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

2
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,043
<i>Colonel Gascon and his droid squad</i>

3
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:24,545
<i>steal an encryption module</i>

4
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:26,214
<i>needed to crack a Separatist code</i>

5
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,384
<i>and stop an impending attack
on the Republic.</i>

6
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:30,919
<i>After surviving The Void</i>

7
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:33,755
<i>and escaping the hostile planet
of Abafar,</i>

8
00:00:33,823 --> 00:00:37,895
<i>our heroes finally appear to be
headed in the right direction.</i>

9
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:46,239
Hmm, looks like the Jedi cruiser

10
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,142
is expecting this shuttle.

11
00:00:48,209 --> 00:00:50,278
Well, I'm sure there's someone aboard

12
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:54,150
who can put this encryption
module to good use.

13
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:57,021
Well, soldiers, this is the end
of the mission.

14
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:59,458
Colonel Gascon has succeeded.

15
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:01,193
R2, contact the bridge.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,064
Tell them I request a meal
with the captain.

17
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,669
Nothing too fancy,
and, uh, I don't eat bantha.

18
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:12,075
What do you mean you still
can't make contact?

19
00:01:12,143 --> 00:01:14,812
I have got a bad feeling
about this, Colonel.

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,283
Something is not right.

21
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,891
<i>Snogwash!</i>

22
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:26,294
It's probably just the effects
of The Void.

23
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,831
All that, uh, magnetic disruption

24
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,734
messed up his circuitry.

25
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:36,909
I will not allow your frivolous worrying

26
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:40,547
to undermine this...
this glorious moment!

27
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,450
I expect a hero's welcome,

28
00:01:42,518 --> 00:01:44,921
not to mention my inevitable promotion

29
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:47,191
to P1 Brigadier!

30
00:02:08,622 --> 00:02:09,989
Wow.

31
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:12,859
They really went overboard
on the welcoming committee.

32
00:02:14,463 --> 00:02:16,231
Good question, QT.

33
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:19,770
Why are there not any other
shuttles or crew members?

34
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:24,075
Well, everyone's probably
preparing to, uh...

35
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:25,464
Well, they'll all want to be there

36
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,813
when we break the Separatist code.

37
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:33,454
How should I know why
all the blast doors are shut?

38
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:35,557
That's a question
for the captain of this ship

39
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:39,863
and one I intend to ask
just as soon as I find him.

40
00:02:45,538 --> 00:02:48,340
Sergeant, Colonel Meebur Gascon.

41
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:50,643
You have no doubt been expecting me.

42
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,847
I am delivering the Separatist
encryption module.

43
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,251
Why... it's just a hologram.

44
00:03:07,733 --> 00:03:11,003
What in the blazes is going on here?

45
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,376
I do not know.

46
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,345
But we just made the jump to hyperspace,

47
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,950
which means somebody
is navigating this ship.

48
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:33,766
You, droids!

49
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,836
What are you doing on our ship?

50
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,707
Surrender or you will be destroyed.

51
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:39,775
Battle droids!

52
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,480
Whoo... ahh!

53
00:03:50,157 --> 00:03:51,657
The commander wants the detonator

54
00:03:51,725 --> 00:03:53,727
taken to the control room.

55
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:54,928
Roger, roger.

56
00:03:56,432 --> 00:03:57,599
Okay, let me just...

57
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,669
Lift with your legs!
Lift with your legs!

58
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:01,104
Uh, heavy, heavy.

59
00:04:01,172 --> 00:04:03,374
Watch it, watch it!
Look out!

60
00:04:03,441 --> 00:04:05,009
Good thinking back there.

61
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:08,547
But next time <i>I</i> give the orders.
Understood?

62
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
I got it.

63
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,585
I got it.

64
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,820
I don't got it!

65
00:04:13,888 --> 00:04:14,888
Yaah!

66
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,892
Uh-oh.

67
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:24,433
I wasn't programmed for this.

68
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,139
Stop!
Which way are we going?

69
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,511
Down here!

70
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:35,183
Aah!

71
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:45,263
Have you seen the intruders?

72
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,966
They went that way?

73
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,200
Roger, roger.

74
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:55,910
All right, something
very strange is going on here.

75
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:00,148
It appears this ship has been
hijacked by Separatists.

76
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:05,522
What do you mean it doesn't belong here?

77
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,990
He is right, Colonel.

78
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,527
This is not Republic technology.

79
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:12,364
Not unless they have lowered
their standards.

80
00:05:12,432 --> 00:05:15,235
Well, what exactly do you think it is?

81
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,138
A bomb?

82
00:05:18,206 --> 00:05:19,808
What kind of a bomb?
Is it on?

83
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:22,110
How long do we have?
Talk to me!

84
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:27,617
What do you mean the ship is a bomb?

85
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:30,521
How can the entire ship be a bomb?

86
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:45,106
Mother of Kwath...

87
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:47,777
There must be enough rhydonium in here

88
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:51,415
to blow up the entire Republic fleet.

89
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:03,335
I don't know what any of this means,

90
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:06,272
but I want off this ship immediately.

91
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:11,180
My mission is over.

92
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:14,685
I had no orders to stop
Separatist piracy

93
00:06:14,753 --> 00:06:18,190
or disarm massive,
titanic-scale bombs!

94
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:21,794
C4 has a good point.

95
00:06:21,862 --> 00:06:24,231
If we do not stop this ship
before it explodes,

96
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,801
it could cost the Republic
thousands of lives.

97
00:06:26,869 --> 00:06:28,771
Pure speculation.

98
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,475
We're evacuating this ship,
and that is an order!

99
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:37,683
Oh, right.

100
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,785
We'll have to wait to evacuate

101
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:42,156
until the ship is out of hyperspace.

102
00:06:42,223 --> 00:06:44,426
By then it could be too late.

103
00:06:44,494 --> 00:06:47,397
Once we get where we are going,
my guess is...

104
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:48,732
kaboom!

105
00:07:03,386 --> 00:07:04,386
Wait!

106
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,389
I...

107
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,858
no...

108
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,760
okay, okay!

109
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:19,306
I don't know, QT.

110
00:07:19,374 --> 00:07:21,575
Where is R2 gone now?

111
00:07:24,546 --> 00:07:27,349
What's going on?
Who is this?

112
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:32,490
I am BNI-393,
an LEP Servant Droid.

113
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:34,861
My master called me Bunny.

114
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:37,398
And where is your master?

115
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:38,732
He was killed

116
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,236
when the Separatists
took control of this ship.

117
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:43,672
Why were you hiding from us?

118
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,276
At first I did not know
if I could trust you.

119
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,679
Then I was not sure
you would believe me.

120
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,581
Once you saw the truth,

121
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:53,018
I was simply hoping
you would abandon ship

122
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,421
and take the rest of us with you.

123
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:56,489
Rest of you?

124
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,623
You're telling me

125
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:59,726
there's more
Republic crew members on board?

126
00:08:04,032 --> 00:08:06,501
Did you destroy the intruders?

127
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,770
Uh, no.

128
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:10,072
There are Republic droids on this ship

129
00:08:10,141 --> 00:08:11,908
that could ruin our plans.

130
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:17,215
You will search the entire ship
until the intruders are found

131
00:08:17,283 --> 00:08:19,351
and report back to me.

132
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,041
Is this a joke?

133
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:39,878
The rest of the crew is in our shuttle?

134
00:08:39,946 --> 00:08:42,148
I told them to wait inside

135
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,450
and that we would be leaving

136
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:46,054
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

137
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,434
You can come out now.

138
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,735
It is okay.

139
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:08,284
These are the other crew members?

140
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,585
As you can see,

141
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:11,989
none of us can pilot the shuttle,

142
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,925
which is why we needed you.

143
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:15,426
Why you need <i>me</i>.

144
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,494
Hi, there.

145
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,496
I am the pilot.

146
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,001
What is this Separatist plot?

147
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,470
I do not know the details.

148
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,906
I was only able to steal the coordinates

149
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:25,974
of their target.

150
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,342
Target?

151
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:32,249
You mean they aren't just
planning to blow up this ship?

152
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,718
I do not believe so.

153
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,088
The coordinates are a space station

154
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:37,724
in the Carida system.

155
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,791
What?

156
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,792
That's the site

157
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,762
of the Republic Strategy Conference.

158
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:45,500
How do I know?

159
00:09:45,568 --> 00:09:47,069
I was putting the finishing touches

160
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:49,239
on a report for that conference

161
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,943
when I was assigned this mission.

162
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,644
The Jedi Council will be there,

163
00:09:53,712 --> 00:09:56,882
along with Republic officers
from around the galaxy and...

164
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,351
What the...

165
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:01,889
The Separatists are going to ram
the station with this ship!

166
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:04,659
I agree.

167
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,662
We have to do something, R2.

168
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:08,531
See if you can send a transmission

169
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,567
to the Republic so we can warn them.

170
00:10:10,635 --> 00:10:11,869
It is no use.

171
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:13,405
We have tried that.

172
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:16,609
All transmissions from this ship
are being blocked.

173
00:10:18,412 --> 00:10:19,713
Hmm, you're right.

174
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:21,883
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

175
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:27,556
Where's he going?

176
00:10:27,623 --> 00:10:28,623
Uh-oh.

177
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,793
That buzz droid is not with me.

178
00:10:30,861 --> 00:10:32,929
It must be a spy!

179
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:35,766
Stop that droid!

180
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,859
Where'd he go?
We've got to find him.

181
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:21,361
I do not know.
I do not see him anywhere.

182
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:24,566
Uh, Colonel...

183
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,236
I think I see him.

184
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:29,139
I think I see a whole lot of him.

185
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:30,540
It's a trap!

186
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:00,247
Good work.
You've established a perimeter.

187
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,918
There are still more coming!

188
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:11,429
Please tell me you have
a brilliant strategy, Colonel!

189
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,699
I don't know!
There's just so many of them.

190
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,569
What do you mean, "get out"?

191
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,576
All right, what are you going to do?

192
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:24,479
You are going to open the air lock?

193
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:26,115
Are you crazy, BZ?

194
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:40,435
Everybody, magnetize your feet!

195
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,603
Lock down!

196
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,844
BZ!
Magnetize!

197
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:48,647
Magnetize!

198
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:49,748
No!

199
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,564
R2, close the door!

200
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:04,333
Close the door!

201
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,415
Poor BZ.

202
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:18,952
You will be missed, soldier.

203
00:13:20,087 --> 00:13:21,488
R2 is right.

204
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:26,529
Colonel, would you say something
to honor this heroic sacrifice?

205
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:29,132
I suppose that's appropriate.

206
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,236
I'll have to make it quick
because we don't have much time.

207
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:34,640
When this D-Squad
started our mission,

208
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:36,208
I had doubts.

209
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,745
Grave doubts that we would ever survive,

210
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:40,648
let alone succeed.

211
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,584
But we worked together.

212
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:44,019
We didn't give up hope.

213
00:13:44,086 --> 00:13:46,622
We showed courage in the face of death.

214
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,592
It shocks me to say this,

215
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,696
but we make an excellent team.

216
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,466
Now we've lost one of our members...

217
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,768
BZ.

218
00:13:55,836 --> 00:13:57,538
But we must remember.

219
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:01,176
BZ sacrificed himself for us.

220
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:04,513
That's what a good soldier does
sometimes.

221
00:14:04,581 --> 00:14:07,150
The only way to honor that sacrifice

222
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:08,919
is to stop this ship

223
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:10,688
and prevent the Separatists

224
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:13,192
from taking any more Republic lives.

225
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
Are you with me?

226
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,653
Have the buzz droids
reported back in yet?

227
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:27,489
No, there has been no signal from them.

228
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:30,860
In fact, I cannot even locate
their signal anymore.

229
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:32,161
We must assume, then,

230
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:34,265
that the buzz droids have failed.

231
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,037
I want those intruders found
before they ruin our plans.

232
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,306
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

233
00:14:44,413 --> 00:14:46,448
All right, everybody knows the plan?

234
00:14:46,516 --> 00:14:48,652
We get the injured droids to the shuttle

235
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,020
and distract the battle droids

236
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,357
while R2 goes up to the detonator

237
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,494
and programs it to explode early.

238
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:56,529
Hopefully he can make it
back to the shuttle

239
00:14:56,597 --> 00:14:59,533
and we can all get off the ship
before it blows up.

240
00:15:01,103 --> 00:15:03,406
Good luck, R2.

241
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:08,812
The intruders!
Destroy them!

242
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:25,836
You can make it!

243
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,906
Hurry!
Hurry!

244
00:15:49,068 --> 00:15:51,302
We have our target in sight.

245
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,772
Full ahead.

246
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,908
Ramming speed.

247
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,411
Evacuation plan is now under way.

248
00:15:57,479 --> 00:16:00,783
I will go to the detonator
and start the countdown.

249
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:14,887
The worst part about our job

250
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,169
are these boring strategy conferences.

251
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,505
Cheer up, Anakin.

252
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,573
This is your chance to voice
all your complaints

253
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,409
about military protocol.

254
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:25,446
And it looks as though
we can finally get under way.

255
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:28,818
I will inform Master Windu
the last straggler has arrived

256
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:31,555
while you work on your attitude.

257
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,498
Isn't that ship coming in
a little too fast?

258
00:16:42,137 --> 00:16:43,305
There's the shuttle!

259
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,450
Careful, you'll hit the rhydonium.

260
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:54,353
Everyone, head to the ship!

261
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,457
C4 and I will distract them.

262
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:16,881
You are too late.

263
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,722
Once the detonation sequence
has commenced,

264
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:23,690
there is no stopping it.

265
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,101
Now let's see if R2 made it
to the detonator.

266
00:17:38,812 --> 00:17:40,147
R2 is in trouble!

267
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:41,215
Come on!

268
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:47,189
R2 will never make it back
to the shuttle in time.

269
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:49,993
We've got to delay the launch.

270
00:17:52,731 --> 00:17:54,833
The cruiser has not slowed its pace.

271
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,969
Have you been able to contact
their captain?

272
00:17:58,239 --> 00:18:00,675
Z9 says he cannot make contact
with anyone.

273
00:18:00,743 --> 00:18:04,047
Where's R2 when I need him?

274
00:18:13,627 --> 00:18:16,262
We've got to regroup
and head back for R2.

275
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,366
Well, we're changing the plan!

276
00:18:19,434 --> 00:18:21,001
No one gets left behind,

277
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,005
and we're not leaving until I say so!

278
00:18:24,073 --> 00:18:26,041
Prepare for liftoff!

279
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,338
No.
It is too soon.

280
00:18:50,405 --> 00:18:53,275
We are scanning a large amount
of rhydonium on that ship!

281
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,544
It's a bomb.

282
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,163
And you thought
this conference would be boring.

283
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:39,671
Mayday! Mayday!

284
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:41,139
Space station Valor,

285
00:19:41,207 --> 00:19:43,142
this is Colonel Meebur Gascon.

286
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,212
Can anyone hear me?

287
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,379
We read you, Colonel.

288
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:47,915
This is General Skywalker.

289
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,317
What's going on out there?

290
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,888
Slight change in our mission, General.

291
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:54,958
The droids and I were stowaways
on that cruiser.

292
00:19:55,026 --> 00:19:56,393
Where's R2?

293
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,930
I'm sorry to report he was on that ship

294
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:00,532
when it blew up, sir.

295
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,969
He just saved all your lives.

296
00:20:03,037 --> 00:20:05,940
I want a salvage team out there now!

297
00:20:06,008 --> 00:20:07,008
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:38,283 --> 00:20:39,784
R2!

299
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,423
You made it, buddy!

300
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:46,293
Hey, you're a big hero.

301
00:20:49,199 --> 00:20:52,736
There's someone here
who wants to speak to you.

302
00:20:57,244 --> 00:21:01,114
R2D2, are we glad to see you.

303
00:21:01,182 --> 00:21:02,683
I am most glad.

304
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,819
Quiet, WAC.
I'm talking here.

305
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,022
Yes, sir, Colonel.

306
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:11,929
In truth, I might just be a map reader,

307
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:15,300
and I don't have much battle experience,

308
00:21:15,368 --> 00:21:16,535
but, R2,

309
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:20,306
you are the bravest droid
I have ever met.

310
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:21,776
You all are.

311
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,713
I would be proud to serve
with you droids

312
00:21:24,781 --> 00:21:26,615
anytime, anywhere.

313
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:29,352
Oh, I am glad to hear you
say that, Colonel,

314
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,791
because I hear we have been
assigned to the same platoon!

315
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,093
We will be seeing each other every day

316
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,163
for the rest of the war!

317
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:39,900
That's great, WAC.

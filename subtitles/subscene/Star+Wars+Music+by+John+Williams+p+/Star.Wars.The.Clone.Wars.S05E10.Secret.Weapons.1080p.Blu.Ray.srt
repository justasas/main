1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,687
<i>Secret transmission intercepted!</i>

2
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:23,190
<i>The Jedi Council has intercepted</i>

3
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,492
<i>an encoded transmission
of General Grievous.</i>

4
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,928
<i>However, Republic Intelligence officers</i>

5
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:29,963
<i>have failed to crack
the new encryption code</i>

6
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,565
<i>being used by the droids.</i>

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,833
<i>Fears escalate that the Separatists</i>

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,802
<i>are about to mount a major offensive.</i>

9
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,637
<i>Having located the source
of the transmission</i>

10
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,406
<i>deep in Separatist space,</i>

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,974
<i>the Jedi plan a counterstrike</i>

12
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,276
<i>to capture an enemy decoding chip</i>

13
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,545
<i>which will allow them
to understand the transmission</i>

14
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,682
<i>and thwart the Separatist plot.</i>

15
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:56,321
Time is not on our side,
so I'll make this short.

16
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,090
You droids have been chosen
for a very important mission.

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,725
There's an encryption module

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,660
on board this Separatist dreadnought.

19
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:07,463
This device is scrambling
all Separatist communication

20
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:08,798
in the region.

21
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:11,701
We believe you five
can get behind enemy lines,

22
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:12,902
infiltrate the vault

23
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,905
without drawing attention to yourselves,

24
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:17,641
and steal that encryption module.

25
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,851
WAC-47, reporting for duty!

26
00:01:26,885 --> 00:01:27,885
Sorry I am late.

27
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,286
I thought the message said to meet

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,921
in the "Jedi storeroom",
whatever that is.

29
00:01:31,956 --> 00:01:33,056
Heh.

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,058
So did I miss anything?

31
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,695
Fall in line, soldier.

32
00:01:46,237 --> 00:01:49,006
So I hear we're
gonna be taking out Separatists.

33
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:53,410
I will be honest.

34
00:01:53,445 --> 00:01:55,645
Some of you may not make it back.

35
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:57,513
What...
why is he looking at me?

36
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:01,017
Uh, were you just looking at me?

37
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:04,788
I... I was just kidding.

38
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:06,956
But I have faith in your abilities.

39
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:09,459
You are not ordinary droids.

40
00:02:09,493 --> 00:02:11,495
You've worked with the Jedi before.

41
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:14,832
You are our secret weapons.

42
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,701
Now, let me turn you over
to your mission leader.

43
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,870
The colonel is one of our top minds

44
00:02:19,904 --> 00:02:21,505
at Strategic Command.

45
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,374
He's been with the Republic
since the Battle of Geonosis,

46
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:25,776
Colonel Meebur Gascon.

47
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:37,755
Thank you, Master Windu.

48
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:40,224
I'll take it from here.

49
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,693
May the Force be with you.

50
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:53,537
Attention!

51
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:59,443
Now, I'm only gonna say this once,

52
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,978
so turn up your audio inputs.

53
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:07,283
Once we're inside the cruiser,
we make our way to "C" deck.

54
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:10,753
That's where their
communication center is housed.

55
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,155
We bypass security here and here,

56
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:15,157
divert the super battle droids here.

57
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:17,559
Then we break the vault code,
beat the swarm mines,

58
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:18,960
steal the encryption module,

59
00:03:18,994 --> 00:03:21,429
and return home in time
for my promotion ceremony

60
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:22,697
to brigadier general.

61
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:24,031
Are we clear?

62
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:31,440
Uh... uh...

63
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,142
Good, that's what I like:

64
00:03:33,176 --> 00:03:34,811
no questions.

65
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,412
Oh.

66
00:03:36,447 --> 00:03:40,683
D-Squad, fall in line!

67
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,794
The line starts behind me, mech.

68
00:03:51,828 --> 00:03:53,162
Clang!

69
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:18,551
Over here, you mechs, front and center.

70
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:20,653
This is Dr. Gubacher.

71
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:23,789
- He is...
- Uh, uh, Corporal?

72
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:24,824
Colonel.

73
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,025
Right.

74
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,395
Well, I just want
to set the record straight.

75
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:29,663
I am not a mech.

76
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,431
You called us all mechs back there,

77
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:34,000
but as you can see, I am a WAC.

78
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,036
Granted, my master's not a Jedi,

79
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,472
but I am a different class of droid...

80
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,207
better engineering.

81
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,681
As I was saying,
before I was rudely interrupted,

82
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:50,684
Dr. Gubacher
is going to equip each of you

83
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:52,119
with a tactical upgrade

84
00:04:52,154 --> 00:04:54,321
specially designed for this mission.

85
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,525
All right, enough with the chatter.

86
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,694
Let's get this show on the road.

87
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,230
Cyclops,

88
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,331
you're not needed here.

89
00:05:02,365 --> 00:05:04,333
Go prepare our shuttle for launch.

90
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:17,112
R2-D2,

91
00:05:17,147 --> 00:05:19,181
these advanced rocket boosters

92
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:22,851
should give you better aerial mobility

93
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,754
and for longer periods of time.

94
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:27,322
Ah, but be advised:

95
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:31,159
the navigation controls
are finely tuned.

96
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:33,094
QT-KT,

97
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:37,164
this coil
is a remote-controlled magnet.

98
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,401
It can attract any metal object
in a seven-meter radius.

99
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:44,437
But when dealing with mines,

100
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:47,073
you'll want to take care.

101
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:51,110
The magnetic force
is extremely powerful.

102
00:05:51,145 --> 00:05:54,447
U9-C4,
this laser-cutter

103
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:58,917
will slice through most
materials you encounter.

104
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:01,253
But make sure
you're in a locked position.

105
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:07,224
The recoil packs quite a wallop.

106
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,631
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:19,269
M5-BZ, we are not
putting anything inside you.

108
00:06:19,303 --> 00:06:21,371
We're taking something out:

109
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:22,972
your memory banks.

110
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:28,178
I'll be making the extraction myself

111
00:06:28,212 --> 00:06:29,646
in the salvage room.

112
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:34,616
I am sorry,

113
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:35,718
but we need to make room

114
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:38,187
for the colonel's command center.

115
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:40,156
No need to baby him.

116
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,524
He's just a droid.

117
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,096
Fortunately,
he won't remember any of this.

118
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,213
What do you want, BZ?

119
00:07:04,247 --> 00:07:06,715
It's me, you moron.

120
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,551
What are you doing in there, Corporal?

121
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:11,487
And how many times
do I have to tell you?

122
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,489
It's colonel.

123
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,626
Nice setup.

124
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,328
I want to know
why I did not get an upgrade.

125
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:22,465
Because you are just a pilot!

126
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,700
Now do your job

127
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,469
and pilot this ship!

128
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:30,700
Just a pilot...
we will see about that.

129
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,572
All right, Cyclops, listen up.

130
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:53,141
I want you to alert me
when we near the dreadnought.

131
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,010
I have a plan on how
to attract their attention.

132
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,244
Relax.

133
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,180
I already took care of it.

134
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,252
What do you mean?

135
00:08:04,286 --> 00:08:06,187
What did you do?

136
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:10,391
I put us on a collision course
with the dreadnought.

137
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,106
See, Corporal?

138
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:27,341
I am not just a pilot.

139
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,542
You idiot!

140
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,644
We're caught in a tractor beam.

141
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:52,632
Hold it right there.

142
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,601
Out of the way, tin cans.

143
00:08:57,138 --> 00:09:00,474
Let's check the cockpit.

144
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:08,585
No sign of life, just these droids.

145
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:10,289
Continue your search

146
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:14,960
while I take these droids
in for interrogation.

147
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,135
Everyone just stay calm.

148
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:29,340
Oh, my gosh!

149
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,610
You are Republic droids!

150
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:35,413
That is right, and I am their leader.

151
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:39,050
Yeah, I got him.

152
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,487
Well, thanks for the assist, QT.

153
00:09:59,537 --> 00:10:01,238
All right, listen up.

154
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:04,408
The next phase of my plan
is to reach "C" deck.

155
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:07,177
We'll take this path here.

156
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,113
Since the mechs
won't draw much attention,

157
00:10:09,147 --> 00:10:10,581
we'll go in a convoy.

158
00:10:10,615 --> 00:10:12,548
Cyclops, you lead the way.

159
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,616
If anyone asks,

160
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:15,752
you're taking the droids
on a repair job.

161
00:10:15,786 --> 00:10:16,786
Got it?

162
00:10:16,787 --> 00:10:19,456
Yes, sir, uh...

163
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,490
Captain.

164
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:21,725
It's colonel!

165
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,160
I swear, Cyclops.

166
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:26,063
You are gonna drive me crazy.

167
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,470
Now, I want flat top

168
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:35,541
to locate the comm-vault
power supply

169
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:37,543
then use his laser to cut the main line

170
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:39,946
and cause a temporary loss in power.

171
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:43,282
You can do it, C4!

172
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,764
Oh, do not forget
to lock down your...

173
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:13,378
Sir, there was a temporary
power loss on "C" deck.

174
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:15,580
Has
the power been reestablished?

175
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,148
Yes.

176
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:19,484
It was only a temporary fluctuation.

177
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:22,587
Hmm, curious.

178
00:11:24,757 --> 00:11:26,157
All right, listen up.

179
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,192
Cutting the power

180
00:11:27,193 --> 00:11:28,960
put the comm-vault
security system

181
00:11:28,994 --> 00:11:30,862
in manual override.

182
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:32,630
But someone still has to distract

183
00:11:32,665 --> 00:11:34,132
some super battle droids.

184
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:35,933
Oh, please, please, please.

185
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,134
Let me do it, come on, come on,

186
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:40,470
come on, come on, let me do it, please.

187
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:41,505
Come on, come on.

188
00:11:42,507 --> 00:11:43,574
All right.

189
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:45,943
You will not regret this, corporal.

190
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,978
I am not a...

191
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,620
Halt.

192
00:11:56,655 --> 00:11:58,655
I have been ordered by General Grievous

193
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,257
to test comm-vault security.

194
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:02,126
And I need your help.

195
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Now, follow me.

196
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,803
Now, I will go inside
the comm-vault

197
00:12:13,838 --> 00:12:15,605
and send out a power surge.

198
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,274
I need you two to stay here.

199
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,115
It will not be safe for you
while I am working.

200
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:26,650
Are we clear?

201
00:12:26,684 --> 00:12:27,951
Yes, but...

202
00:12:27,986 --> 00:12:28,986
- Good.

203
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:29,987
That is what I like:

204
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:31,154
no questions.

205
00:12:31,188 --> 00:12:33,623
Huh?

206
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,594
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

207
00:12:37,628 --> 00:12:38,628
Shh.

208
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,629
Quiet.

209
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,131
We need to keep moving.

210
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,867
BZ, open the comm-vault
security door.

211
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:46,102
Uh, make sure it
is not booby-trapped.

212
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,714
You blockhead!

213
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:01,984
Now we're going to lose manual override.

214
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:05,387
You... you terminated BZ.

215
00:13:05,422 --> 00:13:09,291
It's not my fault
he fried his circuitry.

216
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:13,762
I didn't tell that nitwit
to attack the access panel.

217
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:17,333
So what do we do now, Corporal?

218
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:22,872
Look, we can still salvage this mission.

219
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,240
If one of you could just...

220
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:26,475
you need to reaccess that panel,

221
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:30,078
and we have to open
that comm-vault door fast

222
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:33,982
and grab the encryption module
before we're caught red-handed.

223
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,019
No, I will not do it myself.

224
00:13:38,054 --> 00:13:39,388
I'm an officer.

225
00:13:39,422 --> 00:13:44,993
I've got no experience
in this type of crisis maneuver.

226
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,496
You fought in the Battle of Geonosis.

227
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:50,065
That did not prepare you for a crisis?

228
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:54,502
Well, technically,
I didn't fight in that battle.

229
00:13:54,537 --> 00:13:57,538
I'm a military analyst
by trade and...

230
00:13:57,573 --> 00:13:59,373
You are a map reader?

231
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,513
I am an accomplished
battlefield strategist.

232
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:09,516
I analyze the enemy terrain
and plot a course to victory.

233
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,585
In other words, you read maps.

234
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,554
You're off base here, Cyclops!

235
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:17,657
I was chosen for my fearsome cunning,

236
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:22,827
although my size
may have played a small factor.

237
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,197
But do not think for a moment

238
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,199
that Colonel Meebur Gascon

239
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:31,836
is going to relinquish command
of this mission.

240
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,006
I have waited a lifetime
for this opportunity,

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,776
and some ragtag collection of droids

242
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,712
is not going to deny me my destiny.

243
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,114
So one way or another,

244
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:44,449
I will open
that comm-vault door.

245
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,255
Oh, there, just like I planned it.

246
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,561
Now, we're
going to infiltrate this vault,

247
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,863
neutralize the swarm mines,

248
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,132
and then secure the encryption module.

249
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,600
Any questions?

250
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:07,071
Have you ever been in a battle before?

251
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,839
No, I have not.

252
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:11,175
But if you'd care to see
what I'm made of,

253
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:13,577
we can go to war right now, you and me,

254
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:17,180
and probably get ourselves
captured by a Separatist.

255
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:19,916
Or we can execute my plan

256
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,952
and come out of this mission
looking like heroes.

257
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:26,622
The choice is yours, Cyclops.

258
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:32,662
First of all, my name is WAC.

259
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:36,200
Second of all,
we will execute your plan.

260
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:40,503
But you have to stop calling us
stupid names, Shorty.

261
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:47,542
Very well, WAC.

262
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:49,244
I'll play nice,

263
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,881
but only until one of you
screws up again.

264
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,460
Sir, there has been another
disturbance on "C" deck.

265
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:08,296
I will investigate

266
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,332
this situation personally.

267
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:23,162
All right, Pinky...
I mean, QT.

268
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:24,930
This is your chance to shine.

269
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:29,134
Use your magnet
to attract those swarm mines.

270
00:17:04,167 --> 00:17:09,738
There it is, the encryption module.

271
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,307
It's all up to you now, R2.

272
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,912
Not so fast.

273
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:20,414
Arms up.

274
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:28,122
Gravity.

275
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:29,157
Pop!

276
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:31,326
Right, turn it off, quick!

277
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:09,397
Thud!

278
00:18:15,604 --> 00:18:17,338
Ah!

279
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,281
I will help you, Corporal.

280
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,123
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

281
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,825
Corporal, are you okay?

282
00:18:38,859 --> 00:18:39,859
Look out!

283
00:18:52,574 --> 00:18:57,410
I will turn the gravity back on.

284
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,845
Hurry, WAC, hurry!

285
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,761
Pop!

286
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,002
I'll take that.

287
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,972
Ha-ha, good work, R2.

288
00:19:23,006 --> 00:19:24,507
Intruder alert.

289
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,807
Intruder alert.

290
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:26,841
Intruder alert.

291
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,576
Intruder alert.

292
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,412
Let's move it out,
D-Squad.

293
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,990
What are you doing?

294
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,391
We're going to get caught!

295
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,528
R2 says
we cannot leave BZ behind.

296
00:19:50,165 --> 00:19:51,465
R2's right.

297
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,400
We can repair him on the shuttle.

298
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,771
There's trouble on "C" deck.

299
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:59,306
Report there immediately.

300
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:13,654
Get out of the way,
you stupid astromechs.

301
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,163
Funny thing about droids

302
00:20:23,197 --> 00:20:25,698
last thing they'd expect to betray them:

303
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,266
another droid.

304
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,907
D-Squad, let's go home.

305
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:09,911
Ah, my first mission...
a rousing success

306
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:13,582
and a brilliant plan
if I do say so myself.

307
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,985
I agree, R2.

308
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,788
The team's execution was not too shabby.

309
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,991
Who knows, you droids

310
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:27,128
might just make decent soldiers
after all.

311
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,132
Oh, and you, too, WAC.

312
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,401
Yes, sir, Colonel.

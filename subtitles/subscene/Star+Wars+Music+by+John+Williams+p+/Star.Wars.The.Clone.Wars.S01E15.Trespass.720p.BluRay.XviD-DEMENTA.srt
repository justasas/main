Have your men survey the area.

Place as many sensor beacons
as you can before dark.

12
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:59,850
Right away, sir. Unload that gear!
Let's move!

13

The Chairman of Orto Plutonia
requested it? But why?

16
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,990
-General Kenobi.
-Chairman Cho, Senator Chuchi,

17
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,993
I suggest you wait here
until we can secure the area.

18
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,164
I respect your judgment, General Kenobi,
but I will go where I choose.

19
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,583
This is sovereign Pantora territory.

20
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,337
I thought this planet was uninhabited,
and therefore it's not aligned.

21
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:32,508
Our moon of Pantora
is the only civilization in this system.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,677
I'm the one who asked the Senate
to protect this planet.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,180
This wasteland belongs to us.

24
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:43,519
With all due respect, Chairman,
this is for the Senate to decide, not us.

25
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:48,482
Ah, but the Jedi report to the Senate,
which is Senator Chuchi of Pantora.

26
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,402
Technically speaking, Master Jedi,
the Chairman is correct.

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,029
Since the planet is uninhabited,

28
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:57,825
the moon of Pantora reserves the right
to continue as its protectorate.

29
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,868
Point taken, Senator.

30
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,081
Anakin, stay here with the Senator
and the droids while we secure the base.

31
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,889
-I don't get it.
-It must be Separatists.

32
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,724
I'm not sure.

33
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:29,022
Might we go inside, Master Anakin?
Artoo would like to get out of the cold.

Do you think the Separatists are building
a forward base to attack Pantora?

37
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,746
I don't think
we're dealing with Separatists.

38

These computers haven't been touched.

39

Sir! Our scouts have spotted a droid base
on the other side of the ice ridge.

40

By the look of things,

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,445
I'd say whoever attacked our base
took out the droids, also.

60
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:44,366
Chairman, what makes you so certain
the Separatists are behind this attack?

61
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,745
Look around, Senator.
Isn't this carnage proof enough?

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,249
I know, but there are no dead droids here,
no blast marks.

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,042
The clones' injuries were not consistent
with what...

64
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,671
So, you're an expert on war now,
are you, Senator?

65
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:02,259
-No, Chairman. No, I only...
-Let me tell you something, Senator.

I have led our people
since before you were born.

67
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:09,016
I've seen a hundred planets
rise and fall through force of arms.

68
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,309
If it's not the Separatists out there,

69
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,519
then it's a malevolent and aggressive
enemy nonetheless,

70
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,147
and I will not let whoever it is
jeopardize the security

72
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,569
But if the Jedi discover
that the Separatists aren't behind this,

73
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,405
then perhaps there is
a peaceful resolution.

Senator, I am willing to fight and die

It's time to ask yourself
if you are brave enough to do the same.

these creatures, the Talz,

101

aren't advanced enough
to master space travel.

102
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,105
I think they may have been here
longer than Pantora.

This whole system belongs to us.

then the Senate must decide jurisdiction.

They've slaughtered your troops.

107

They only want to be left alone.
The droids attacked them,

108
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,669
and I'm afraid our outpost
got caught in the middle.

109
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,047
They must be subdued. They're dangerous.

there would be no retaliation.

You can't lie to an animal.

Actually, Master Jedi,
since you are far more experienced,

212
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,580
I was hoping you could negotiate
on Pantora's behalf.

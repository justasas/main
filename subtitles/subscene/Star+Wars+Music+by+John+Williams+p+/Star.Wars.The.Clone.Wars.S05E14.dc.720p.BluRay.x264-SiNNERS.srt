I serve no one.

19
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:29,301
I thought there could only be two Sith,
a master and an apprentice?

Fortune and power.

27
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,747
Repair this one's legs

Now my people are living in exile
because we will not abandon our heritage.

37
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,507
Our people were warriors. Strong, feared.

38
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,226
Now they're ruled by the new Mandalorians

39
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,396
who think that being a pacifist
is a good thing.

40
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,521
They've given away our honor
and tradition for peace.

41
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,318
Duchess Satine and her corrupt leadership
are crushing our souls,

42

43
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,408
That is our struggle.

If they are weak, why do you wait?

45
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,710
The Duchess has powerful allies,
including your Jedi friend, Kenobi.

46
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,874
He is also responsible for our exile.

47
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,926
Perhaps fortune brought us together.

48
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,380
It is the will of the Force.

49
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,552
We can help you reclaim Mandalore.

50
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,641
And punish Kenobi for his trespasses.

51
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:51,648
We allied ourselves with Sith before.
Count Dooku, he betrayed us.

52
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,315
Sith are no better than Jedi.

53
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,313
They claim to be powerful,

54
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,988

Your people are strong and skilled,

but you will need an army
to free Mandalore.

81

who will join us.

82

With my plan,
we won't need a bigger force.

00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:30,481
The vision has expanded.
You will still rule Mandalore,

183
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:35,448
and under your protection,
I will command a new galactic underworld.

184
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:44,332
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

185
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,963
It gives you a great deal of options
for your enterprise.

186
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,126
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

187
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:56,640
With their combined forces, the Republic
and the Separatists will be irrelevant.

188
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,345
Then, are we ready?

189
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,721
Mobilize the army.
Send an advance guard to the capital.

190
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,816
I want a list of targets vital
to Mandalore's security.

191
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:11,150
Choose wisely.
There will be no second chances.

192
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,868
Stay focused.
Mandalore will soon be ours,

193
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,043
and Maul and his brother will be dead
alongside the Duchess.

194
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,674

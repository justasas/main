1
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,886
<i>Terror at the Temple!</i>

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,924
<i>The Jedi Temple is in disarray</i>

3
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:25,223
<i>after a vicious terrorist attack.</i>

4
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,292
<i>Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano</i>

5
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:28,592
<i>set out to find the truth</i>

6
00:00:28,626 --> 00:00:31,594
<i>of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.</i>

7
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:34,963
<i>Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,</i>

8
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:36,632
<i>Letta Turmond.</i>

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,901
<i>Now the Jedi attempt to return
the Temple to normalcy.</i>

10
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,636
<i>But first Master Yoda must give a eulogy</i>

11
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,206
<i>to the fallen Jedi warriors.</i>

12
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:49,407
One with the Force, they are.

13
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,176
And our job it is
to remember that we will,

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,844
in time, also pass on.

15
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:56,778
Luminous beings are we,

16
00:00:56,813 --> 00:00:59,547
but temporary vessels, our bodies are.

17
00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:03,883
And we shall all find ourselves
here in time.

18
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,918
A moment of silence, I ask,

19
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:09,655
to remember and to move on.

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,691
You were close to one of them?

21
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:16,459
Tutso Mara.

22
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,128
We trained together.

23
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,597
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

24
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:26,867
Live for the living Jedi, we must.

25
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:30,603
Live through us, forever they will.

26
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:54,287
So what happens to Letta now?

27
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:55,521
The bomber has been moved.

28
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:56,622
Moved?

29
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:57,689
Where?

30
00:01:57,723 --> 00:01:59,791
Why should she be moved?

31
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:02,526
The Republic military
has taken her into custody.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,059
But why?

33
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:06,295
This is a Jedi matter, isn't it?

34
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:07,629
Clones were killed,

35
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:09,297
which makes this terrorist attack

36
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:10,998
a military matter.

37
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:14,401
An attack on the Jedi
is an attack on the Senate.

38
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,235
Admiral Tarkin is right.

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,037
Letta isn't a Jedi.

40
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,804
It's not for us to be judge and jury

41
00:02:19,838 --> 00:02:21,272
over a citizen of the Republic.

42
00:02:21,306 --> 00:02:23,774
If Letta's guilty, she's guilty,

43
00:02:23,808 --> 00:02:25,742
and she should be dealt with.

44
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,177
Calm down, Ahsoka.

45
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:30,712
Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way.

46
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:34,815
The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka.

47
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,150
Nothing will ever change.

48
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,118
The Chancellor feels very strongly

49
00:02:39,153 --> 00:02:40,419
that the Jedi be removed

50
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:43,954
from as many military matters
as possible.

51
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,156
You yourselves
said that you're peacekeepers,

52
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:49,025
not soldiers.

53
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,927
I hope Chancellor Palpatine
knows what he's doing.

54
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:54,162
I assure you
that he rarely does anything

55
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,797
without a strategy.

56
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:04,936
I have many things
to attend to, Masters.

57
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,638
Good day.

58
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,171
Ahsoka.

59
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,540
Go.

60
00:03:12,575 --> 00:03:14,576
Be with your friend, Ahsoka.

61
00:03:18,347 --> 00:03:20,180
In ways, she is still very young.

62
00:03:20,215 --> 00:03:21,748
Indeed.

63
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:27,718
Company?

64
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:29,153
Sure.

65
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:33,054
Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

66
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:37,691
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

67
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,159
Ahsoka, have you ever wondered

68
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,428
if it was right to ignore your emotions?

69
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,262
My Master would say,

70
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:47,264
"Our struggle as Jedi
is to move past them."

71
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:48,899
You make it sound so easy.

72
00:03:49,968 --> 00:03:51,668
No, it isn't easy.

73
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:52,970
But it's possible.

74
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:54,138
Like, when we were stuck

75
00:03:54,172 --> 00:03:55,972
inside the battle tank on Geonosis,

76
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,140
it was hard not to be afraid.

77
00:03:58,175 --> 00:04:00,242
Still, you and I got past it.

78
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:02,811
And I guess we'll get past this.

79
00:04:02,845 --> 00:04:05,613
You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

80
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:09,076
I guess I've fooled you
like I have everyone else.

81
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,851
Yes, Master.

82
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:13,818
Ahsoka, we're needed in the war room.

83
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,220
It appears the Separatists
have mounted another attack.

84
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:18,922
Coming, Master.

85
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:22,324
Look, I have to believe
that one way or another,

86
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,259
this woman's going to pay
for what she did.

87
00:04:25,294 --> 00:04:28,628
You shouldn't keep your Master waiting.

88
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,035
<i>We've uncovered
a Separatist plan of attack.</i>

89
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:42,170
<i>We shall travel
to the Anoat system here,</i>

90
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:44,305
<i>then move across to Saleucami.</i>

91
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:46,408
So far out of our way?

92
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,844
<i>Unfortunately, we must avoid
these neutral systems.</i>

93
00:04:49,878 --> 00:04:51,477
<i>Excuse me, Master Jedi.</i>

94
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,679
Yes, Admiral.

95
00:04:52,713 --> 00:04:54,347
<i>Commander Tano,</i>

96
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,049
<i>your presence is requested
by prisoner Letta Turmond.</i>

97
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,616
The prisoner from the hangar bombing?

98
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,618
Why is she asking for Ahsoka?

99
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:01,820
<i>Not exactly sure.</i>

100
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:03,787
<i>But Commander Tano is the only person</i>

101
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,621
<i>the prisoner will speak to.</i>

102
00:05:05,655 --> 00:05:08,791
I'll report back
with whatever I find out.

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,120
<i>Yes?</i>

104
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:52,154
<i>I'm Commander Tano.</i>

105
00:05:52,188 --> 00:05:54,389
<i>Letta Turmond requested to see me.</i>

106
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,924
<i>A lot of innocent people
died in that blast.</i>

107
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,492
<i>Good job capturing her.</i>

108
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,361
All right, scan her.

109
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:11,202
<i>Leave your comlink and lightsabers here.</i>

110
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,407
Follow me.

111
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,659
What do you want, Letta?

112
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:47,027
I was told if I ever needed help,

113
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:48,595
you were the Jedi to contact.

114
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,200
Give us a minute, please.

115
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:00,503
You don't have much time, Letta,

116
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:02,839
so I suggest you get
whatever you have to say

117
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,473
off your chest.

118
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,778
The idea of feeding Jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

119
00:07:09,813 --> 00:07:12,280
Why are you saying this now?

120
00:07:12,314 --> 00:07:14,214
Why didn't you reveal this before?

121
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:16,516
Because my life is in danger.

122
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:18,451
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

123
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:20,586
unless you know the truth.

124
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,922
Huh.
What's the truth?

125
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,256
A Jedi.

126
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:26,491
A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb

127
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,559
and how to put
the nano-droids in.

128
00:07:28,593 --> 00:07:31,095
Why would a Jedi do this?

129
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,131
There are some citizens
of the Republic, like myself,

130
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:36,800
who believe the Jedi Order
is not what it used to be.

131
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,934
The Jedi have become warmongers.

132
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,769
They've become military weapons.

133
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:41,904
And they're killing

134
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:44,138
when they should be keeping the peace.

135
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,473
One of these Jedi agreed with us.

136
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,042
One of you wanted to make a statement

137
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,810
and was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

138
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:54,846
Who?

139
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,347
If you protect me, I will tell you,

140
00:07:57,382 --> 00:08:00,416
because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

141
00:08:00,451 --> 00:08:03,852
Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

142
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,855
It's...

143
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,890
Letta!

144
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:10,924
Letta!

145
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,991
Letta!

146
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,093
Prisoner health critical,

147
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,761
holding cell 173.

148
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:19,362
Commander Fox, the prisoner.

149
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:20,797
Follow me.

150
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:25,535
Letta!

151
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:35,543
I...
don't know what happened.

152
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,911
Commander, she's dead.

153
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:40,746
I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano.

154
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:43,715
But all the same, you're under arrest.

155
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,851
I...
No, no.

156
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,885
I did not do this.

157
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:19,279
Admiral Tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

158
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:21,184
I went in the room to talk to Letta,

159
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:23,652
and she said she was afraid of a Jedi.

160
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:30,156
You don't have to tell me
any more, Commander Tano.

161
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,424
I don't?

162
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,251
No.

163
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,626
There are recorders in every room.

164
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,563
Curiously, the sound
isn't working on this one.

165
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,185
It seems the Jedi
she was afraid of was you.

166
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,701
I did not kill that woman.

167
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:49,236
You were the only one there.

168
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,679
I know that you were upset
when this woman

169
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,950
was taken into custody by the military.

170
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,306
That means nothing.

171
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,574
I beg to differ.

172
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,525
It was someone else, Admiral,

173
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,527
someone I didn't see.

174
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:02,128
You know that is very difficult

175
00:10:02,162 --> 00:10:03,963
for me to believe.

176
00:10:03,997 --> 00:10:06,064
This is a secure facility.

177
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,233
We do not have
just anyone running about.

178
00:10:09,268 --> 00:10:11,669
And if there was someone else,

179
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:14,338
why did you not sense them?

180
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:26,214
I said my Padawan is in there.

181
00:10:26,248 --> 00:10:27,681
Now, step aside.

182
00:10:27,715 --> 00:10:29,483
General Skywalker,

183
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:33,886
Admiral Tarkin has ordered
that no one be allowed in there.

184
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,921
I don't care what she's accused of.

185
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:38,222
Let me in.

186
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,894
Sorry, sir.

187
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:46,229
The admiral's orders stand.

188
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:48,364
This is now a military operation

189
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,766
and under his jurisdiction.

190
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,555
A key card.

191
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,490
Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

192
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:38,035
I wonder what you have planned.

193
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,611
Oh, no.

194
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:51,246
This does not look good.

195
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,486
My lightsabers.

196
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,890
Hello?

197
00:12:06,924 --> 00:12:08,424
Who is this?

198
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,091
Why are you helping me?

199
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:13,561
What's going on here?

200
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,496
It wasn't me.

201
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,398
Alert!
Alert!

202
00:12:20,433 --> 00:12:22,267
The Jedi prisoner has escaped.

203
00:12:40,014 --> 00:12:41,314
Commander Tano, stop!

204
00:12:45,484 --> 00:12:47,351
She's heading north
in the prison corridor.

205
00:12:47,386 --> 00:12:48,652
Cut her off!

206
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:49,919
Copy that.

207
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,135
Oh, no.

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,840
The suspect has killed three clones.

209
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:21,940
Code red.

210
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:24,708
If you see the target, shoot to kill.

211
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,209
Belay that order, Commander Fox.

212
00:13:26,244 --> 00:13:28,211
She's killed troopers.

213
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:29,746
I know Commander Tano.

214
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,381
She would never do something like this.

215
00:13:32,415 --> 00:13:33,682
Then who did?

216
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,750
Quiet!

217
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:36,984
Ahsoka!

218
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,919
It's me, Anakin.

219
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,890
Stop running.

220
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,759
You can't help me, Master.

221
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,561
Someone's setting me up.

222
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,629
I believe you, Ahsoka.

223
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,331
But no one else will.

224
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,102
Keep searching until we find her.

225
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,302
Rex, call security.

226
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:02,504
Tell them we need
to search the entire base.

227
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:03,572
Now!

228
00:14:04,706 --> 00:14:06,140
General Skywalker has just issued

229
00:14:06,174 --> 00:14:08,942
an all-points bulletin
on Commander Ahsoka Tano.

230
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:10,310
She's killed three clones

231
00:14:10,344 --> 00:14:13,678
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

232
00:14:30,277 --> 00:14:32,196
The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

233
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,446
cell block 1218-11.

234
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:17,116
Come on, Grizzer.

235
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,550
There's nothing here.

236
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,090
There she is!

237
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,258
Quick, stop her
before she gets to the ship!

238
00:16:01,364 --> 00:16:03,545
All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

239
00:16:03,665 --> 00:16:04,698
What's going on?

240
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,517
We've found her.

241
00:16:05,637 --> 00:16:07,438
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

242
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,101
Set weapons to stun.

243
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,302
I want her alive!

244
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,633
Do not shoot to kill.

245
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,667
Do not shoot to kill!

246
00:16:58,702 --> 00:16:59,702
Try to box her in.

247
00:16:59,703 --> 00:17:00,803
Don't let her escape.

248
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,704
Tell me what you see, Oddball.

249
00:17:16,347 --> 00:17:18,382
She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

250
00:17:32,726 --> 00:17:34,226
All right, we got her now.

251
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,537
This will knock her off her feet.

252
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,618
Not so fast, Commander.

253
00:18:32,035 --> 00:18:33,102
Ahsoka!

254
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:12,336
Ahsoka, what are you doing?

255
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,971
You didn't even try to come and help me.

256
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,639
They wouldn't let me in to talk to you.

257
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,773
You could have if you tried.

258
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,143
How would that look, Ahsoka, huh?

259
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,343
Forcing my way in

260
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,979
would've made you look even more guilty.

261
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,179
I'm not guilty!

262
00:20:26,214 --> 00:20:28,581
Then we have to prove you're innocent.

263
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:31,183
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

264
00:20:31,217 --> 00:20:33,317
I don't know who to trust.

265
00:20:33,351 --> 00:20:36,520
Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, Ahsoka,

266
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:37,721
never.

267
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,389
But you need to come back

268
00:20:39,423 --> 00:20:41,157
and make your case to the Council.

269
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:42,726
No.

270
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,961
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

271
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,031
I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

272
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:51,566
and come with me now!

273
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,634
Trust me.

274
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,236
General Skywalker, where are you?

275
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,738
I do trust you.

276
00:20:56,772 --> 00:20:58,805
But you know as well as I do

277
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,207
that no one else will believe me.

278
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:08,034
Anakin, you have to trust <i>me</i> now.

279
00:21:08,154 --> 00:21:10,047
Ahsoka, I do trust you.

280
00:21:10,081 --> 00:21:11,747
I know you do.

281
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:15,116
Wish me luck.

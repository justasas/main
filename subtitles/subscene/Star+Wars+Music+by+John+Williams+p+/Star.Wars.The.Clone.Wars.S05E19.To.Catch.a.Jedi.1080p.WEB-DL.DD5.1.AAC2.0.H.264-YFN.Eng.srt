00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:19,900
Male announcer:
Ahsoka tano on the run!

5
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:21,669
After an attack
on the jedi temple,

6
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:24,805
Anakin skywalker's young padawan
found herself accused

7
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:28,075
Of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.

8
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:31,879
With no choice but to run,
she was chased by her master,

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,081
Who begged her
to turn herself in.

10
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:38,052
Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,

11
00:00:38,054 --> 00:00:40,087
Ahsoka decided
to find out the truth

12
00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:45,059
And prove her innocence
on her own.

13
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:50,097
- After further investigation,
there can be little doubt

14
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,466
That the clone officers
murdered in the escape

15
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,036
Were killed by none other
than ahsoka tano herself.

16
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,104
She used a jedi mind trick

17
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:59,440
To convince the clone
to open the door

18
00:00:59,442 --> 00:01:00,841
And then proceeded
to cut him down

19
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,977
Along with five other clones
along the way.

20
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:08,816
- I do not believe that ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

21
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:11,919
- The beliefs of
the jedi council are irrelevant.

22
00:01:11,921 --> 00:01:14,488
We deal strictly in facts
and evidence,

23
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,658
And the evidence points
to padawan tano being guilty

24
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,826
Of the attack on the temple

25
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,395
And the murder
of the republic officers.

26
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,898
This is sedition.

27
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:30,404
- Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your padawan

28
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:32,440
Before she escaped?

29
00:01:32,442 --> 00:01:33,874
- No, master mundi.

30
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,410
- The council believes
that ahsoka

31
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:37,978
May be guilty of the crime,

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,448
Still believe they are wrong,
do you, hmm?

33
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,384
- I believe she didn't kill
the clone troopers

34
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:45,152
Or the woman
who used the nano-droids

35
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,620
To blow up the temple.

36
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:48,055
That's why she's running.

37
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,723
To prove her innocence.

38
00:01:49,725 --> 00:01:51,459
- Now she's in the lower depths.

39
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,062
With her skills,
she will be hard to find.

40
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:57,064
- Two teams we will send.

41
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:00,434
Master skywalker
and master plo koon,

42
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,769
With clones you will go.

43
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,739
- I think it would be best
if skywalker stayed here.

44
00:02:05,741 --> 00:02:10,611
Having you involved
may actually make things worse.

45
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,914
- Master windu,
with all due respect,

46
00:02:13,916 --> 00:02:15,816
She is my padawan.

47
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:18,786
- The reason for you not to go.

48
00:02:18,788 --> 00:02:19,787
- I think we're being foolish

49
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,756
If we take anakin
off this mission.

50
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:23,824
Who knows her better?

51
00:02:23,826 --> 00:02:24,925
- He's emotionally tied to her.

52
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,461
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

53
00:02:27,463 --> 00:02:29,964
- I'd rather capture ahsoka
and find out the truth

54
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,866
Then let her run
because of a lie.

55
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:36,504
- You must prove to us
that you will stay focused.

56
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:36,871
Can you?

57
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:39,874
- I've already alerted security
on the lower levels

58
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,843
To be on the lookout for ahsoka.

59
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:48,015
- Go swiftly then, skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

60
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,718
Before it is too late.

61
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,053
- Yes, master.

62
00:03:27,856 --> 00:03:29,456
- This one just came in.

63
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:33,093
Looks like the jedi
are after one of their own.

64
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:34,562
She's armed and dangerous.

65
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,598
Alert all units.

66
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,767
- You heard him.

67
00:03:56,785 --> 00:03:58,485
- Barriss, it's ahsoka.

68
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:00,888
- Ahsoka,
I'm so glad you're safe.

69
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,491
- Safe but on the run.
- Where?

70
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,092
- I can't tell you,

71
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:07,828
But someone is definitely trying
to frame me.

72
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,463
- It's not safe
for you to call me

73
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,065
Using the jedi communicator.

74
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:13,567
Find another way to contact me.

75
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:14,034
- I will.

76
00:04:14,036 --> 00:04:15,703
- In the meantime,
I'll do some digging

77
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,605
And see if I
can find anything out

78
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,073
To help you on my end.

79
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,474
- Thank you, barriss.

80
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,976
- Be safe.

81
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:24,912
- [grunting and laughing]

82
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,656
- Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

83
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:37,992
- Yeah.

84
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:39,560
- Let's make a trade.

85
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,996
- [nickering]

86
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,397
[sniffing]

87
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,799
What do you want?

88
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:47,835
- Your cloak.

89
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:28,642
- Passes, please.

90
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:31,111
Passes, please.

91
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,418
Passes, please.

92
00:05:46,428 --> 00:05:49,029
- That's her.
The rogue jedi.

93
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:50,831
[electronic dinging]

94
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:53,934
[train engine whirring]

95
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,768
- All units respond.

96
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,937
We have located the rogue jedi.

97
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,606
- Uh.
- Whoa.

98
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:03,477
- Ah!
- Oh.

99
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,746
- Get out of the way.
Look out!

100
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,582
- [babbling]
- stop her!

101
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:10,951
- I've got her.

102
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:14,021
- Ah!

103
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,589
- [speaking rodese]

104
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:16,557
- Ugh.

105
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,624
- Look out.
- Ah.

106
00:06:17,626 --> 00:06:20,561
- Whoa.
- Ah!

107
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:30,370
- [gurgling]

108
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,607
<i>Dupa-la zuga lu!</i>

109
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:35,008
- Sir, look!

110
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,779
- Stop!

111
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,453
[blasters firing]

112
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,655
[electronic crackling
and chiming]

113
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,624
- Not good.

114
00:06:52,594 --> 00:06:55,662
- [frantic panting]

115
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:59,867
- Don't worry, little guy,
I'll get us out of this.

116
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,604
I'll--I'll think of something.

117
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:07,074
Maybe I can cut a hole
in the roof.

118
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:10,711
- <i>Ya kumay na.</i>
<i>Ya kumay na.</i>

119
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:11,945
- Almost there.
- <i>Kumay na.</i>

120
00:07:11,947 --> 00:07:15,516
- Almost got it.
- <i>Kumay na.</i>

121
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,917
<i>Kumay na.</i>

122
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,054
<i>Kumay na.</i>

123
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:21,722
- Huh.

124
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:27,694
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

125
00:07:37,605 --> 00:07:40,641
Thanks, kid.
I owe you one.

126
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:05,599
- The lower level police claim
to have spotted commander tano

127
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:07,501
Heading to level 1312.

128
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:10,704
- All right,
let's bring her home.

129
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,751
[squeaking]

130
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:43,370
- Uh!

131
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,771
[lightsabers humming]

132
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:47,641
- Well, well,
I didn't believe it

133
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:49,076
When I first heard it,

134
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,377
But I guess it's true,

135
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:55,015
The senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

136
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:56,550
[chuckling]

137
00:08:56,552 --> 00:08:59,019
And I'm going to be the one
who collects.

138
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:02,489
- Ventress,
it was you, wasn't it?

139
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,360
You were behind all of this,
and you framed me!

140
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:09,463
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

141
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:11,965
- Yes, you do!

142
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:15,502
So what are you now,
a bounty hunter?

143
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:20,807
- Yes, and someone who knows
how to make easy money.

144
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,052
- You think
you're just gonna hand me over?

145
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:34,955
And then what?
Get a pat on the shoulder?

146
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:36,924
You're separatist war criminal
and a sith.

147
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:40,027
They'll have us both in prison
before you said your name.

148
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,829
- I don't have to hand you
over to the jedi.

149
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:44,865
I can hand you over
to the bondsman

150
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:45,832
And still get paid.

151
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:50,637
I'm gonna get my money
whether you're dead or alive.

152
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,838
- Heh, good luck.

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,474
Despite what you hear,
I'm still a jedi.

154
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:59,346
- I'm afraid the other jedi
no longer see it that way.

155
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,816
- I hate to admit it,
but you're right.

156
00:10:02,818 --> 00:10:05,652
That's why
I'm going to need your help.

157
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:10,424
- In what star system do you
think I would ever help you?

158
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:13,060
- A traitorous jedi tried
to blow up the jedi temple

159
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:15,829
And has framed me for that
and other killings.

160
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:20,100
- Mmm, so the jedi
aren't that holy after all.

161
00:10:20,102 --> 00:10:23,637
- I know dooku
tried to have you killed.

162
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,739
I know he betrayed you.

163
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:28,408
What if this
is his new apprentice?

164
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,443
I've fallen from my path

165
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:31,078
Just as you've fallen
from yours.

166
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,580
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

167
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:38,118
- What can you offer me
that's better than money?

168
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,421
- If you help me,
I'll speak to the council

169
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:43,123
And the senate on your behalf.

170
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,493
I'll get you a full pardon
for your crimes.

171
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,028
- You have my attention.

172
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,498
But I'm going to go
where the tide flows.

173
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,034
If the tide
is flowing against you,

174
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:59,172
Don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

175
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,774
- Fair enough.

176
00:11:00,776 --> 00:11:05,812
- I suggest we find
somewhere else to discuss this.

177
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,415
- Shine the light over there.

00:11:32,073 --> 00:11:34,674
- Ventress.

180
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:36,743
Send out the probes.

181
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,578
I want them found now!

184

- Not everyone on coruscant

185
00:11:51,593 --> 00:11:55,395
Lives in a luxurious temple
on the surface.

186
00:11:55,397 --> 00:11:57,864
- I guess I'll have to get used
to that.

187
00:11:57,866 --> 00:12:00,600
- Just make the call.

188
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:10,077
Adding another criminal act
to your record?

189
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,548
- I don't want them
to be able to trace it.

190
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,783
Barriss, it's me.

191
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:19,986
- It's so good to see you,
ahsoka.

192
00:12:19,988 --> 00:12:20,987
Are you okay?

193
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:21,721
- Yeah, I'm okay,

194
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:24,724
If you consider anakin
and a hundred clones on my tail

195
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:25,992
A good space to be in.

196
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:27,727
- You were almost captured?

197
00:12:27,729 --> 00:12:29,763
- Once or twice, yeah.

198
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:30,697
- Where are you?

199
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,566
- I can't say, barriss.

200
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:34,768
- I believe I've found a clue.

201
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,869
- A clue?

202
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:37,370
How?
From where?

203
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,406
- We don't have much time,
ahsoka.

[droid buzzing]

205
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:44,444

[droid buzzing]

207
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,750
- A holo-booth
at the corner of 12th and g.

208
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:51,151
Got it.

209
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:54,654
- Three levels up there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

210
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:55,755
Where they used
to build munitions

211
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:58,692
That letta visited during
the time she was getting access

212
00:12:58,694 --> 00:12:59,726
To the nano-droids.

213
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:01,428
- How did you find this out?

214
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,663
- I told you
I would do some checking.

215
00:13:03,665 --> 00:13:05,699
- Ah, thank you, barriss.

216
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,735
- Be careful, ahsoka.

217
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,041
- Well?

218
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:17,477
- I think I have a lead.

219
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,386
- It doesn't seem
like you need my help.

220
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:26,953
- That's not true.

221
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,756
We need to find
an abandoned munitions warehouse

222
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:30,624
On level 1315.

223
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:34,628
We should be able to find
some information there.

224
00:13:35,663 --> 00:13:39,900
You know the place
I'm talking about, don't you?

225
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,834
- Yes.

226
00:13:40,836 --> 00:13:42,736
I can get you there.

[footsteps]

228
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:50,644

229
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:53,613
I don't want to fight.

230
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:55,415
- I do.

231
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,450
- We're taking you in now,
commander.

232
00:13:57,452 --> 00:14:00,620
- That's not gonna happen,
trust me.

233
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:03,089
Now I'm not going to hurt
any of you--

234
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,860
We're not going to hurt
any of you--

235
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:10,096
But you're not taking me in.

236
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:14,034
- Commander,
we are taking you in.

237
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:15,502
[lightsabers humming]

238
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:16,336
- Let's play.

239
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:17,404
- Take 'em out.
Ah!

240
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:18,672
Take her out.
Take her out.

241
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:20,674
- Ventress, don't.

242
00:14:21,842 --> 00:14:23,810
- Look out!
Ugh!

243
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:27,814
- They'll cut us down!

244
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:28,848
Oh!

245
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,450
- Watch it!

246
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:33,453
- Take a shot.

247
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:36,957
- Too fast.

248
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:43,997
- Arg.

00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,376
- See?

252
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,612
Didn't kill one.

253
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:01,081
It's the new me.

254
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,386
- General plo koon,
we had commander tano,

255
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:10,824
But she escaped
with the help of asajj ventress.

[squeaking]

257
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:18,898
- There it is.

258
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,003
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

259
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,114
I've done my part
of the bargain,

260
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:37,384
Which means you're on your own
from here.

261
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,418
But don't forget,

262
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,421
You have to speak
on my behalf now.

263
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:42,922
That was the deal.

264
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:43,723
- Agreed.

265
00:15:43,725 --> 00:15:46,926
Thanks for getting this far,
at least.

266
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,028
I have to admit,

267
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,500
I never saw us
doing anything together ever.

what I'm looking for?

Ventress!

had a change of heart.

Why bring me here?

Answer me, ventress.

00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,464
Why?

- Calling all units.

292
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:13,299
Suspicious activity
on level 1315.

293
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,988

Nano-droids?

No, wolffe, let me explain.

[stun blaster firing]

298
00:20:28,676 --> 00:20:29,876
- Explosives.

299
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,778
These are the same types
of nano-droids

300
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,081
That were used to blow up
the jedi temple.

301
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,684
- I can't believe it.

302
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:46,926
- Captured she has been?

303
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,895
- Yes, master yoda.

304
00:20:48,897 --> 00:20:50,063
- Without incident?

305
00:20:50,065 --> 00:20:52,599
- No, she was subdued
by the clones

306
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:56,803
And found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

307
00:20:56,805 --> 00:21:00,473
- It still doesn't explain
ventress' involvement.

308
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,041
We saw her with ahsoka.

309
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:04,877
I think there's more going on
than we know.

310
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:08,081
- By ahsoka or against her?

311
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,016
- That remains to be seen.

312
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,818
- We're bringing her back
to the temple.

313
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,755

we can keep her here.

1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,646
Piracy in deep space!

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:25,567
Infamous outlaw Hondo Ohnaka attacks
a Jedi transport carrying six younglings,

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,195
who just received their lightsaber crystals.

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,322
So rare are these crystals,

5
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:34,660
that Hondo knows he can sell them
on the black market for a small fortune.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,204
In a desperate attempt
to save the younglings,

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,832
Ahsoka Tano is captured by Hondo
and his pirate horde.

8
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:46,213
Now, with a damaged ship,
the younglings are stranded and alone.

9
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,847
This is the Crucible.
Calling the Republic fleet.

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,891
Come in, please. We need help.

11
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,602
This is General Kenobi.
We have your transmission.

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,229
The General Kenobi?

13
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,069
The pirate Hondo has attacked
and severely damaged our ship

14
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,738
and taken our chaperone, Ahsoka Tano.

15
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,533
I'm dispatching Commander Cody
to bring you back.

16
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,535
We shall deal with Hondo on Florrum.

17
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,120
Will Ahsoka be all right?

18
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,082
Hondo would be even more of a fool
than I think he is to hurt her.

19
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,877
Once we've picked you up,
we'll focus on rescuing Ahsoka.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,629
But we could help Ahsoka a lot
sooner than you can.

21
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:30,215
You have shown great bravery
but these pirates...

22
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,093
It was us who managed
to drive them from the ship.

23
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,598
You will not jeopardize your safety
trying to be heroes, understood?

24
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,266
Yes, Master.

25
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,562
Their coordinates put them
dangerously close to Florrum.

26
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,439
I do not want them getting any ideas.

27
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,107
You will need to leave quickly, Cody.

28
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,276
Sir, enemy fleet's
coming out of hyperspace!

29
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,791
Battle stations! Launch all fighters!

30
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:08,170
Cody, looks like you're staying
here for now.

31
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:30,752
What do you think?

32
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,755
I think you've finished your lightsaber.

33
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,425
Doesn't mean you know how to use it.

34
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,845
Well, if you hurry up with yours,
maybe we could find out.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,396
I'll finish mine when I'm ready.

36
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:55,068
Seeing as how our rescue party
has forgotten us,

37
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,904
you'll have plenty of time.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,158
They probably just got delayed.

39
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:06,997
Delayed? Ahsoka needs our help
and we're sitting around like children.

40
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:08,999
We are children.

41
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,585
I vote we mount a rescue mission.

42
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,714
Gungi is with me. Byph?

43
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,719
That's three votes for and...

44
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,429
One against.

45
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,767
Perfect timing.

46
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:28,769
There's a problem with the ship.

47
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,270
What kind of problem?

48
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,608
Breaking away from the pirate ship
ruptured the entire filtering system.

49
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,943
What does that mean?

50
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,195
It means, she's venting coolant

51
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,906
and if we don't land soon,
the engines will explode.

52
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:43,283
We'll have to land and let the system reset.

53
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,286
Then it's settled.
If we stay out here, we'll die.

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,290
We go to Florrum, let the engines cool,
and rescue Ahsoka.

55
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,920
A rescue mission?

56
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,324
It would be wise
if you would let me go.

57
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,411
No, it would be unprofitable
if I would let you go,

58
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,582
and why would I do something
as shortsighted as that?

59
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,917
If you don't let me go,

60
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,504
you will wish you had been born
a protocol droid.

61
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,923
Sometimes I do anyway.

62
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:45,137
But you are really in no position
to make threats, young lady.

63
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,682
You look stressed. Are you thirsty?

64
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,475
A drink, perhaps?

65
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,608
Sorry, but I do not like to share.

66
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,863
Our forces are being overrun.

67
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,074
The droids are sending out
boarding parties.

68
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:50,827
We must get to the main hangar
to repel them.

69
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,795
We're being overrun! Push forward!

70
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:02,983
Kenobi...

71
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,952
You'll regret that.

72
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,505
Florrum.

73
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,846
Guess we're in the right place.

74
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,701
Artoo, finish reassembling
Master Huyang, will you?

75
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,704
I hate to see him like this.

76
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,124
Ganodi, you stay with the ship.

77
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,335
And who put you in charge?

78
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,462
We're going to need to make quick escape.

79
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:08,632
And you are the only one that
had flight simulator training at the temple.

80
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,552
Oh. Seeing as you put it like that...

81
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,918
I don't see anything, there's no one.

82
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,006
Are we sure we even landed
near their base?

83
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,092
Well, we couldn't land too close, could we?

84
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:57,431
My scanner's indicating
a strong power source, that way.

85
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,933
It must be their base.

86
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:04,271
You have no idea how we are going
to get inside and find Ahsoka, do you?

87
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,772
I'm working on it.

88
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,610
Byph is right, we better get moving.

89
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,945
We'll figure out a strategy on the way.

90
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,378
You know the Republic
won't pay a ransom for me,

91
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,464
and the Separatists can't be trusted.

92
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,466
They'll betray you and kill us both.

93
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,635
Yes, I know this, my dear.

94
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,971
The Separatists are no friends of mine.

95
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,142
Don't ask me why,
but Dooku holds such a grudge against me

96
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:47,147
since our little "I-held-him-hostage" affair.

97
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:52,611
The truth is, I have my sights set
on more nefarious criminals than I,

98
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:56,323
a businessman,
who will pay handsomely for a Jedi.

99
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,284
A female Jedi at that!

100
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,328
You don't scare me, Hondo.

101
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:07,125
Oh, by the way, they don't care
if you're dead or alive.

102
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:12,005
I mean, I prefer alive, less messy.

103
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:16,802
But I find my moods
so changeable these days.

104
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,644
- General! The fuel barrel.
- Right!

105
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,866
Fall back! Fall back!

106
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:45,080
This is General Kenobi.
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

107
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,915
Sir, shouldn't we stay and fight.

108
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,333
We can't lose the ship now.

109
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,545
Cody, the ship is already lost.
We must face it.

110
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,715
But you and I are going to give Grievous
a little parting gift.

111
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,569
A ship? What kind?

112
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:20,908
The side of the ship says
"Preigo's Traveling World of Wonder".

113
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,952
They're a traveling carnival act!

114
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:30,250
Faster, you lazy creatures! Faster!

115
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,712
Old Hondo will be furious if we are late.

116
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,422
You hear me?

117
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,441
Hey!

118
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,904
You there! What... What are you doing?
I said faster, not stop.

119
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,452
Sir, are we to understand

120
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,955
you are on your way
to the pirate stronghold?

121
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,957
Yes, what's it to you?

122
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,960
Who are you? How did you get out here?

123
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,796
Sir, our ship crashed
and we've been stranded,

124
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,924
but our misfortune is to your benefit.

125
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:23,470
Oh, really?
And how is that, my curious friend?

126
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,473
We are...

127
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:29,601
Acrobats, entertainers!

128
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,982
We would love to join your act and
travel with you to your next destination.

129
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:40,320
Really? All of you wish to join my act?
Right.

130
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,698
You would like to come with us

131
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:47,035
when we go to entertain Hondo
and his pirate horde?

132
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,830
Very much so, yes.

133
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,456
Oh no, no, no. I...

134
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,002
I'm sorry, the pirates are
an unforgiving audience,

135
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,462
I couldn't possibly...

136
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,007
What... How did you...

137
00:14:00,132 --> 00:14:01,884
Oh my, my.

138
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:06,013
Artists! True artists!

139
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:09,933
Young man,
how many of these tricks can you do?

140
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,022
How many do you want?

141
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:19,359
Oh! Welcome to the show!

142
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,419
General, we have secured the ship.

143
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,879
Excellent.

144
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:44,384
Waste no time and get me every last piece
of information from the data banks.

145
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:48,388
General Grievous, you have defeated me

146
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,226
and taken control
of my ship, congratulations.

147
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:56,396
However, if you are watching this message
that means I'm boarding an escape pod

148
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:59,274
and shall soon be safely away
from the ship,

149
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,235
which is about to self-destruct.

150
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,488
General Grievous, you have defeated me...

151
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,917
Sir.

152
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,091
Wait! Wait! What are you doing?

153
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,635
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh!

154
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,614
I'm afraid the younglings
are now on their own.

155
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,482
Preigo.

156
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,491
You better know what you are doing
because I don't see Ahsoka.

157
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,826
Patience.

158
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:39,041
I, Preigo, your humble servant,
have searched far and wide,

159
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:42,336
oh, illustrious plunderer of the universe,

160
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:46,173
and found you
a most special entertainment.

161
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,342
Good!

162
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:53,263
I would hate to be forced to
cut off their heads like I did your last act.

163
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,890
You remember those guys?

164
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,732
You are a brave man
to come before me again.

165
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,568
Look! He has Ahsoka's lightsabers!

166
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,736
I'll get them!

167
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,364
Where is my Jedi?

168
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,908
I would hate for her to miss the show.

169
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,370
Which I'm hoping will be better
than last time.

170
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,874
Excellent! Let the show begin!

171
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,876
Yes, of course.

172
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:28,006
May I present the Animal Instincts.

173
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,266
Oh, no.

174
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,060
I love a kiddie act.

175
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,133
What is this business?

176
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,888
I believe he wants you to be a part
of the next stunt.

177
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,849
Ho-ho! Does he now?

178
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,517
Come with us.

179
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,687
Which one of you said that?

180
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:31,195
I may not be as young as I once was,
but I'm older.

181
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,948
Stand right here.

182
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,576
Who wants to see Hondo's moves?

183
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,703
Talk to me!

184
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,402
You guys shouldn't be here.

185
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:15,614
Don't worry, we have a plan.

186
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,074
I think.

187
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,875
I'm flying!

188
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:30,045
What the...
Oh no, no, no, no!

189
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,755
Not again! Oh!

190
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,889
Well, that was a good act!

191
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:45,394
It's those bleeding Jedi kids.

192
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,146
Wait... What? The children are Jedi?

193
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,314
Oh!

194
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,867
Get to those speeders!

195
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,164
We've gotta run for it!

196
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:08,792
Those blasted kids
have screwed everything up!

197
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,711
Hondo's going to kill us!

198
00:20:24,516 --> 00:20:26,560
Quick! Get to that speeder!

199
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:35,569
Get us out of here!

200
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:43,702
What is going on?

201
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,330
Where's my Jedi?

202
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,041
Someone stop them! Hurry, Gwarm!

203
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,959
Get after them!

204
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,669
Ah.

205
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:54,588
I know how you feel.

206
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,966
You lost your master,

207
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,261
and I lost my Jedi.

208
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:03,222
Ugh.

209
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:15,943
How do you feel?

210
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,153
Better now.

211
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:23,492
I could pretend to be angry
but you were all very brave, thank you.

212
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,285
We disobeyed orders.

213
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,871
Well, I've learned from my master

214
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:32,543
that sometimes doing the right thing
means bending the rules.

215
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,088
Ganodi, come in, please.

216
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:39,007
Get the ship ready we need to take off.

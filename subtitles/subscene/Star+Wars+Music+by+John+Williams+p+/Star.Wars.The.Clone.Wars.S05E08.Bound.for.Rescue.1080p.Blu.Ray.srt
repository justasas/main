1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,383
<i>Piracy in deep space!</i>

2
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,019
<i>Infamous outlaw Hondo Ohnaka
attacks a Jedi transport</i>

3
00:00:24,087 --> 00:00:25,319
<i>carrying six younglings</i>

4
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:28,155
<i>who just received
their lightsaber crystals.</i>

5
00:00:28,374 --> 00:00:30,107
<i>So rare are these crystals</i>

6
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:33,101
<i>that Hondo knows he can sell
them on the black market</i>

7
00:00:33,102 --> 00:00:34,757
<i>for a small fortune.</i>

8
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,312
<i>In a desperate attempt
to save the younglings,</i>

9
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,382
<i>Ahsoka Tano is captured
by Hondo and his pirate horde.</i>

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,950
<i>Now, with a damaged ship,</i>

11
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:45,985
<i>the younglings are stranded and alone.</i>

12
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,124
This is the <i>Crucible</i>

13
00:00:53,192 --> 00:00:55,058
calling the Republic fleet.

14
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,493
Come in please.

15
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,027
We need help.

16
00:00:58,095 --> 00:00:59,395
<i>This is General Kenobi.</i>

17
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:00,730
<i>We have your transmission.</i>

18
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:02,331
The General Kenobi?

19
00:01:05,802 --> 00:01:09,170
The pirate Hondo has attacked
and severely damaged our ship

20
00:01:09,238 --> 00:01:11,905
and taken our chaperone, Ahsoka Tano.

21
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,673
I'm dispatching Commander Cody
to bring you back.

22
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,576
We shall deal with Hondo on Florrum.

23
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,243
<i>Will Ahsoka be all right?</i>

24
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:20,713
Hondo would be even more
of a fool than I think he is

25
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,313
to hurt her.

26
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:25,050
Once we've picked you up
we'll focus on rescuing Ahsoka.

27
00:01:25,117 --> 00:01:27,918
But we could help Ahsoka
a lot sooner than you can.

28
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:30,288
<i>You've shown great bravery,
but these pirates...</i>

29
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:33,189
It was us who managed
to drive them from the ship.

30
00:01:33,257 --> 00:01:34,924
You will not jeopardize your safety

31
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,593
trying to be heroes, understood?

32
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:39,360
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

33
00:01:40,896 --> 00:01:43,697
Their coordinates put them
dangerously close to Florrum.

34
00:01:43,765 --> 00:01:45,665
I do not want them getting any ideas.

35
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,133
You will need to leave quickly, Cody.

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,735
Sir, enemy fleets
coming out of hyperspace.

37
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,380
Battle stations.

38
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:05,014
Launch all fighters.

39
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:08,649
Cody, looks like
you're staying here for now.

40
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:31,612
Heh, what do you think?

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,848
I think you've finished
your lightsaber.

42
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:36,550
Doesn't mean you know how to use it.

43
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,217
Well, if you hurry up with yours,

44
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:39,952
maybe we could find out.

45
00:03:46,624 --> 00:03:50,127
I'll finish mine when I'm ready.

46
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:55,163
Seeing as how our rescue party
has forgotten us,

47
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:57,966
you'll have plenty of time.

48
00:03:59,468 --> 00:04:02,504
They probably just got delayed.

49
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:03,770
Delayed?

50
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:05,806
Ahsoka needs our help,
and we're sitting around

51
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:06,907
like children.

52
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:09,109
We are children.

53
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:11,611
I vote we mount a rescue mission.

54
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:14,881
Gungi is with me.

55
00:04:14,949 --> 00:04:15,949
Byph?

56
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:20,819
That's three votes for and...

57
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,521
One against.

58
00:04:25,324 --> 00:04:26,925
Perfect timing.

59
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,526
There's a problem with the ship.

60
00:04:28,593 --> 00:04:30,394
What kind of problem?

61
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,261
Breaking away from the pirate ship

62
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:34,497
ruptured the entire filtering system.

63
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,031
What does that mean?

64
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,267
It means she's venting coolant,

65
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,935
and if we don't land soon,
the engines will explode.

66
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,404
We'll have to land
and let the system reset.

67
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,504
Then it's settled.

68
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,306
If we stay out here we'll die.

69
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,708
We go to Florrum,
let the engines cool,

70
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,443
and rescue Ahsoka.

71
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,080
A rescue mission?

72
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:24,236
It would be wise
if you would let me go.

73
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,538
No, it would be unprofitable
if I would let you go,

74
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:31,640
and why would I do something
as shortsighted as that?

75
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,742
If you don't let me go,

76
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:37,444
you will wish you had been born
a protocol droid.

77
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,980
Sometimes I do anyway.

78
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,315
But you are really in no position

79
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,885
to make threats, young lady.

80
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,586
You look stressed.

81
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:48,721
Are you thirsty?

82
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:51,489
A drink, perhaps?

83
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:53,691
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

84
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,827
Sorry, but I do not like to share.

85
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,262
Our forces are being overrun.

86
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:48,164
The droids are sending out
boarding parties.

87
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:51,134
We must get to the main hangar
to repel them.

88
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,006
We're being overrun!

89
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,575
Push forward!

90
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,593
Kenobi.

91
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,334
You'll regret that.

92
00:08:22,642 --> 00:08:24,977
Florrum.

93
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:33,151
Guess we're in the right place.

94
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,734
R2, finish reassembling
Master Huyang, will you?

95
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,270
I hate to see him like this.

96
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,172
Ganodi, you stay with the ship.

97
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:03,540
And who put you in charge?

98
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:05,508
We're going to need
to make a quick escape,

99
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,776
and you're the only one that had
flight simulator training

100
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:08,911
at the temple.

101
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:11,813
Oh, seeing as you put it like that.

102
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:44,105
I don't see anything.

103
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,773
There's no one.

104
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:49,341
Are we sure
we even landed near their base?

105
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,411
Well, we couldn't land
too close, could we?

106
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:55,913
My scanner's indicating
a strong power source.

107
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,181
Uh, that way.

108
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,250
It must be their base.

109
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:02,350
You have no idea
how we're going to get inside

110
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:04,619
and find Ahsoka, do you?

111
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,353
I'm working on it.

112
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,823
Byph is right.
We better get moving.

113
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,525
We'll figure out a strategy
on the way.

114
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,806
You know the Republic
won't pay a ransom for me,

115
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,673
and the Separatists can't be trusted.

116
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:32,876
They'll betray you and kill us both.

117
00:10:32,944 --> 00:10:35,011
Yes, I know this, my dear.

118
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:38,280
The Separatists
are no friends of mine.

119
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:41,617
Don't ask me why,
but Dooku holds such a grudge

120
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:46,452
against me since our little
"I held him hostage" affair.

121
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,587
Pah!

122
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,957
The truth is, I have my sights set

123
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,859
on more nefarious criminals than I,

124
00:10:52,926 --> 00:10:56,695
a businessman who will pay
handsomely for a Jedi.

125
00:10:56,762 --> 00:10:59,596
A female Jedi at that.

126
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:01,765
You don't scare me, Hondo.

127
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:02,932
Ooh!

128
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,167
Oh, by the way.

129
00:11:04,234 --> 00:11:07,936
They don't care
if you're dead or alive.

130
00:11:08,004 --> 00:11:10,271
I mean, I prefer alive.

131
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,306
Less messy.

132
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:17,043
But I find my moods
so changeable these days.

133
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,280
Ooh!

134
00:11:23,347 --> 00:11:24,581
General, the fuel barrel!

135
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:25,916
Right.

136
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:37,858
Fall back.

137
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,059
Fall back!

138
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,129
This is General Kenobi.

139
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:45,464
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship!

140
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:47,266
Sir, shouldn't we stay and fight?

141
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,666
We can't lose the ship now.

142
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,468
Cody, the ship is already lost.

143
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,936
We must face it.

144
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,506
But you and I are going to give
Grievous a little parting gift.

145
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,654
A ship?
What kind?

146
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,222
The side of the ship says,

147
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,691
"Preigo's Traveling
World of Wonder".

148
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,226
They're a traveling carnival act.

149
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:30,464
Faster, you lazy creatures.
Faster!

150
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:33,966
Oh, Hondo will be furious
if we're late.

151
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,669
You hear me?

152
00:12:53,282 --> 00:12:54,447
Hey, hey, and now what?

153
00:12:54,515 --> 00:12:56,449
You there, what the...
what are you doing?

154
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:59,150
I said faster, not stop.

155
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,920
Sir.

156
00:13:04,595 --> 00:13:06,198
Are we to understand
you were on your way

157
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,157
to the pirate stronghold?

158
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,357
Yes, what's it to you?

159
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:13,294
Who are you?
How did you get out here?

160
00:13:13,361 --> 00:13:16,096
Sir, our ship crashed
and we've been stranded,

161
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:19,065
but our misfortune is to your benefit.

162
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,433
Oh, really?

163
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:23,602
And, uh, how is that,
my curious friend?

164
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,871
We are...

165
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,540
acrobats!

166
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,509
Entertainers.

167
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:32,877
We would love to join your act

168
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:35,478
and travel with you
to your next destination.

169
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,780
Really?

170
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:39,982
All of you wish to join my act, huh?

171
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,517
Right.

172
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:45,286
You would like to come with us
when we go to entertain Hondo

173
00:13:45,354 --> 00:13:47,421
and his pirate horde?

174
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:50,124
Very much so, yes.

175
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:52,392
Oh, no, no, I... I'm sorry.

176
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,262
The pirates are an unforgiving
audience.

177
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:56,795
I couldn't possibly...

178
00:13:57,931 --> 00:13:58,931
What...

179
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,398
How did you...

180
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,700
Oh, my, my.

181
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:06,370
Artists, true artists!

182
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:10,139
Young man, how many
of these tricks can you do?

183
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:15,342
How many do you want?

184
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,979
Ho, ho, ho, ho, welcome to the show!

185
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,627
General, we have secured the ship.

186
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:38,694
Excellent.

187
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,063
Waste no time,

188
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,197
and get me every last piece
of information

189
00:14:42,265 --> 00:14:44,966
from the data banks.

190
00:14:45,033 --> 00:14:48,369
<i>General Grievous, you have defeated me</i>

191
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:50,470
<i>and taken control of my ship.</i>

192
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:52,338
<i>Congratulations.</i>

193
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,806
<i>However, if you're watching
this message,</i>

194
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,374
<i>that means I'm boarding an escape pod</i>

195
00:14:56,442 --> 00:14:59,376
<i>and shall soon be safely away
from the ship</i>

196
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,677
<i>which is about
to self-destruct.</i>

197
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:04,480
<i>General Grievous,
you have defeated me...</i>

198
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,558
Sir.

199
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:18,692
Ah!

200
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:20,260
Wah!

201
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,296
Wait, wait!

202
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:24,497
What are you doing?

203
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:25,632
Uh-oh.

204
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:26,699
Uh-oh.

205
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:47,882
I'm afraid the younglings
are now on their own.

206
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:23,207
Preigo.

207
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,945
You'd better know
what you're doing because

208
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,713
I don't see Ahsoka.

209
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,780
Patience.

210
00:16:32,848 --> 00:16:36,583
I, Preigo, your humble servant,

211
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:38,852
have searched far and wide,

212
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,121
oh, illustrious plunderer
of the universe,

213
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:46,258
and found you
a most special entertainment.

214
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,426
Good.

215
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:51,162
I would hate to be forced
to cut off their heads

216
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,397
like I did to your last act.

217
00:16:53,464 --> 00:16:55,399
You remember those guys.

218
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:04,040
You are a brave man
to come before me again.

219
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,107
Look.

220
00:17:05,141 --> 00:17:06,574
He has Ahsoka's lightsabers.

221
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:07,642
I'll get them.

222
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,544
Where is my Jedi?

223
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,979
I would hate for her to miss the show

224
00:17:13,046 --> 00:17:16,482
which I'm hoping
will be better than last time.

225
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:19,185
Excellent.

226
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:21,020
Let the show begin!

227
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:23,655
Ah, yes, of course.

228
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:28,392
May I present
the, uh, Animal Instincts.

229
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:37,299
Oh, no.

230
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,134
I love a kiddie act.

231
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,124
What is this business?

232
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:15,894
I believe he wants you to, uh,
be a part of the next stunt.

233
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,862
Oh, does he now?

234
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,065
Come with us.

235
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,566
Which one of you said that?

236
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:29,470
I may not be as young as I once was,

237
00:18:29,538 --> 00:18:31,438
but I'm older!

238
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:35,175
Stand right here.

239
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:37,243
Who wants to see Hondo's moves?

240
00:18:38,312 --> 00:18:39,945
Talk to me, hey!

241
00:19:10,637 --> 00:19:12,371
You guys shouldn't be here.

242
00:19:12,438 --> 00:19:15,774
Don't worry.
We have a plan.

243
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:18,776
I think.

244
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:26,849
I am flying!

245
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,017
Ah!

246
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,085
What the...

247
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:30,385
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

248
00:19:30,453 --> 00:19:31,453
Not again.

249
00:19:31,521 --> 00:19:33,254
Oh!

250
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:38,858
Ah.

251
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:42,027
Well, that was a good act.

252
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:44,864
It's those bleeding Jedi kids.

253
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,931
What?

254
00:19:46,966 --> 00:19:48,066
The children are Jedi?

255
00:19:48,134 --> 00:19:49,134
Oh!

256
00:19:57,706 --> 00:20:00,741
Get to those speeders.

257
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,744
We've got to run for it!

258
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:08,914
Those blasted kids
have screwed everything up!

259
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,815
Hondo's going to kill us.

260
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:26,828
Quick, get to that speeder.

261
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:35,568
Get us out of here!

262
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:44,208
What is going on?

263
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,310
Where is my Jedi?

264
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,011
Someone stop them!

265
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,380
Hurry, Gwarm, get after them!

266
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:52,481
Ah.

267
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,149
I know how you feel.

268
00:20:55,216 --> 00:21:00,653
You lost your master,
and I lost my Jedi.

269
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:02,755
Ugh.

270
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:16,130
How do you feel?

271
00:21:16,198 --> 00:21:18,432
Better now.

272
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,302
I could pretend to be angry,
but you were all very brave.

273
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:23,837
Thank you.

274
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:25,671
We disobeyed orders.

275
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:27,840
Well, I've learned from my Master

276
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:30,341
that sometimes doing the right thing

277
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,475
means bending the rules.

278
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,611
Ganodi, come in please.

279
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:36,845
Get the ship ready.

280
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:37,913
We need to take off.

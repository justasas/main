00:00:16,698 --> 00:00:20,702
{when surrounded by war,
one must eventually choose a side}

4
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:24,602
<i>Republic forces in retreat.</i>

5
00:00:24,979 --> 00:00:28,062
<i>While rescuing General Aayla Secura
from certain defeat,</i>

6
00:00:28,187 --> 00:00:30,937
<i>Anakin Skywalker
has been seriously injured.</i>

7
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:33,736
<i>After a narrow escape,
our heroes crashlanded</i>

8
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,911
<i>on the remote world of Maridun.</i>

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,609
<i>Stranded, and with no way
to contact the Republic,</i>

10
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:42,201
<i>the Jedi receive medical aid
from the peaceful Lurmen colonists.</i>

11
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:46,143
<i>But even on this tiny planet,
the war threatens to follow the Jedi.</i>

12
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,712
Commander Bly, we've got company.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,280
- Friendlies?
- Negative, sir.

14
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,505
A droid ship

15
00:01:18,028 --> 00:01:19,728
<i>coming straight our way.</i>

16
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:21,762
Acknowledged. Get back here.

17
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:27,017
- General?
- Yes, commander?

18
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,227
We've got a Separatist ship
incoming.

19
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,196
This is neutral space.

20
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,625
It won't be neutral for long,
not if the Separatists have their way.

21
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:38,255
- Help me up.
- Don't struggle.

22
00:01:38,653 --> 00:01:41,553
I'm sorry,
but you're still too injured to move.

23
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,834
What menace have you brought
to our village now, Jedi?

24
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,300
Father, you can't blame them.

25
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:59,383
He's right. The Separatists
don't even know we're here.

26
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:01,885
And they can't know.
We've got to hide.

27
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,388
Your presence here endangers us.

28
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,723
You must leave
before your enemies find you.

29
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:10,018
But you'll need our help.
You can't fight them alone.

30
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:12,386
We will not fight them at all.

31
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,564
We would rather die
than to kill others.

32
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,729
You're going to surrender?

33
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,467
- But how can you...
- Ahsoka, stop.

34
00:02:19,905 --> 00:02:23,824
If the Lurmen want to remain neutral,
we won't force them into war.

35
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:25,992
See to it that they leave.

36
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:28,841
I must see
what our new visitors want.

37
00:02:42,094 --> 00:02:44,761
Take it easy, sir.
We'll assist you.

38
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,725
I am General Lok Durd

39
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,650
of the Separatist alliance.

40
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:01,860
I am Tee Watt Kaa,
leader of this colony.

41
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:04,961
- What do...
- You are now under the protection

42
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:06,936
of the Separatist alliance.

43
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:09,105
I congratulate you

44
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,975
on your good fortune.

45
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:15,633
Thank you, but we enjoyed good fortune
well before your arrival.

46
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,800
We are a peaceful people, General.

47
00:03:23,925 --> 00:03:26,007
I do not condone your presence here.

48
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,519
Then stand aside.

49
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:30,916
I would like to inspect
my new colony.

50
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,022
Ransack this dung heap.

51
00:03:44,204 --> 00:03:46,501
Why are they tearing apart
our homes?

52
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,476
We've done nothing to them!

53
00:03:48,748 --> 00:03:49,698
Violence,

54
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,204
that's what those droids
are programmed for.

55
00:03:54,509 --> 00:03:56,041
Can't we do anything?

56
00:03:56,452 --> 00:03:59,878
No, and if we are discovered,
all of the Lurmen will be slaughtered.

57
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:03,465
We'll be okay
if we make it to the tall grasses.

58
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:18,796
There is no evidence of any weapons
or Republic contraband, General.

59
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:23,318
In the future, we may conduct
more periodic searches

60
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:27,282
like this one
in order to maintain security.

61
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,742
Because we are
such an obvious threat to you.

62
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,120
We'll offer no resistance.

63
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,510
Your species is smarter
than you appear.

64
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,935
Father, are you okay?

65
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,039
At least the Jedi escaped.

66
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:56,514
Yes, but they nearly brought harm
to our entire village.

67
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:58,853
But now, thanks to you,

68
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:02,482
we're safe to grovel before every
petty tyrant who enters our system.

69
00:05:02,786 --> 00:05:04,942
You would mock our very way of life?

70
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,195
I have just ensured
we will have peace.

71
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,229
Yes, but for the moment,
and at what price?

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,535
Are you not concerned
about the Jedi at all?

73
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:15,854
I have no quarrel with the Jedi,

74
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:19,207
but we cannot help them
without being drawn into their war.

75
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:24,339
Tub, track the Jedi.

76
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,491
Follow them
and make sure they get off world.

77
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:36,767
You know, I can't figure those villagers
not wanting to fight.

78
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:38,242
No pride I guess.

79
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:40,282
I call it no courage.

80
00:05:40,897 --> 00:05:44,733
Sometimes it takes courage to stick
to one's beliefs, young padawan,

81
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,555
as any Jedi well knows.

82
00:05:47,403 --> 00:05:48,862
We need to find a ship,

83
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:52,199
and I think the only one around here
belongs to the Separatists.

84
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,993
We know they have a landing ship.
They might have a shuttle.

85
00:05:56,828 --> 00:06:00,178
Sir, you talking about stealing
from one of the clankers?

86
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,424
- Count me in.
- We need to find them first.

87
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,130
I think we just did.

88
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:09,921
Blast it!

89
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,601
Jam its signal!

90
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,047
After it!

91
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:21,706
I'm fine. Just go!

92
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:31,776
- Which way did it go?
- This way. Hurry!

93
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,136
We can't catch it
if it gets out in the open.

94
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,736
- I wonder where it was headed.
- Maybe we can see them from up there.

95
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,098
I hope you're feeling better,
Master,

96
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:22,956
'cause look what we found.

97
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:26,167
I'm getting stronger
all the time, snips.

98
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:31,010
But I'm not sure I'm ready for that.

99
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,831
That shuttle's
our ticket off this rock.

100
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,496
It's not gonna be easy, sir.

101
00:07:57,621 --> 00:08:00,971
There don't seem to be any flaws
in their security line.

102
00:08:17,741 --> 00:08:20,133
Apparently,
the Separatists have a new toy.

103
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,632
- See if you can get a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:24,657
I'll go with you, Commander.

105
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:33,651
Is the defoliator capsule ready?

106
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:39,861
Today is a grand day
for the Separatist cause.

107
00:08:40,836 --> 00:08:43,024
We test a new weapon

108
00:08:43,868 --> 00:08:45,458
of my own design

109
00:08:46,165 --> 00:08:50,106
which is capable
of catastrophic destruction,

110
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:54,504
a weapon which will destroy
organic matter

111
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:57,592
but leave machines

112
00:08:58,258 --> 00:08:59,208
unharmed.

113
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:05,716
But first,

114
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:08,345
we need two volunteers.

115
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,550
The volunteers are

116
00:09:12,675 --> 00:09:13,468
you and you.

117
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,028
- Me?
- Me?

118
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:16,771
Go to that ridge.

119
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:18,721
Roger, roger.

120
00:09:26,424 --> 00:09:27,448
Stay down, boys.

121
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,714
Count Dooku,

122
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:35,289
I have located a world
in which we can test my...

123
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:37,252
Excuse me,

124
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:39,359
our new weapon.

125
00:09:40,943 --> 00:09:44,069
<i>I hope it turns out
to be worth the expense.</i>

126
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,841
<i>You may proceed.</i>

127
00:09:46,683 --> 00:09:48,636
Yes, my Lord. Ready?

128
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,055
Roger, roger.

129
00:09:51,478 --> 00:09:52,222
Aim.

130
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:56,396
Fire!

131
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:05,291
Should we take cover?

132
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:07,613
No, idiot.
That is not even gonna hit us.

133
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,415
That's some toy...

134
00:10:29,175 --> 00:10:31,717
It took out every living thing.

135
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:35,145
As you can see,

136
00:10:35,572 --> 00:10:37,788
the landscape has been destroyed,

137
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:41,076
and the droids are undamaged.

138
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:42,855
<i>Impressive,</i>

139
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,227
<i>but now, we need to know</i>

140
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,952
<i>how effective
this weapon will be against</i>

141
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:49,488
<i>living creatures.</i>

142
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,257
Of course.

143
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,699
I specifically chose this planet
because it is inhabited.

144
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:59,790
The colonists will make
excellent test subjects.

145
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,570
<i>Proceed, then.</i>

146
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:04,419
<i>I eagerly await the results.</i>

147
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:07,792
Prepare to move out!

148
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:10,766
Where are they off to now?

149
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,483
They must be going back
to the Lurmen village.

150
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:15,598
There's nothing else
in that direction.

151
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,018
Those villagers
won't stand a chance.

152
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,482
First we'll take out the droids'
communication station.

153
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,897
After we get a shuttle,
we'll go back and help them.

154
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:26,609
But Tee Watt Kaa said
he doesn't need our help.

155
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:29,755
There's a difference
between pulling innocents into a war

156
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,530
and leaving them to extinction.

157
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,323
Tell Wag Too
that the Separatists are returning.

158
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:09,958
Hey, what was that?

159
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,983
Get to the door.
I'll handle the droids.

160
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:16,218
Check the exterior.

161
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:19,186
We cannot have any surprises
for the General.

162
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:23,035
4724, how does the west end
check out?

163
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,226
What the...

164
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:31,150
The Separatists are on the march.
They're returning to our village.

165
00:13:31,318 --> 00:13:33,347
They did not attack us before.

166
00:13:33,472 --> 00:13:35,762
There's no reason to think
they will this time.

167
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,821
Father, they wouldn't be
coming back here

168
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:41,159
unless they intended to do us harm.
This is war!

169
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,920
But not our war.

170
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:45,216
We've done nothing to provoke them,

171
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:47,208
and we will not.
That is their way.

172
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,802
So we will just lay down
and be slaughtered?

173
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:52,321
Father, even if we don't fight
the Separatists,

174
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,089
we must defend ourselves!

175
00:13:54,407 --> 00:13:57,257
Mounting a defense
is still engaging in battle.

176
00:13:57,382 --> 00:14:00,882
If we sacrifice our beliefs,
we're no better than they are.

177
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:04,099
Our philosophy has helped us
to survive for generations,

178
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:07,209
and we will not change
our morals now or ever.

179
00:14:13,408 --> 00:14:16,458
- Shield generator, sir.
- Let's take 'em with us.

180
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:54,719
Everyone, please, please listen.

181
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,860
The Separatists will be here
in moments.

182
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,249
What are you doing here?
I told you not to return.

183
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,826
I'm afraid the Separatists don't care
whether you're in the war or not.

184
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,245
We need to get you to safety
before they arrive.

185
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,497
We will not abandon our homes.

186
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:12,635
But they've got a new weapon.
It'll burn this place to a crisp.

187
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:15,421
Is this what all of you really want?

188
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:18,787
If it is our destiny to be destroyed
in your war,

189
00:15:19,593 --> 00:15:20,543
so be it.

190
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,865
Droids inbound.
We've got eight minutes tops.

191
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,483
Come on, guys. Let's get
these shield generators in place!

192
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:46,487
When Count Dooku sees how successful

193
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,062
my weapon is
against civilian targets,

194
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:51,346
I will no doubt be promoted

195
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,641
to a more...

196
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:56,095
Substantial position
within the alliance.

197
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:58,807
Right.

198
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:02,838
Well, the villagers appear
to have put some pods together

199
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,613
- in a barrier around the village.
- Pods?

200
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:09,366
How quaint.

201
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:12,848
Jedi?

202
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:15,556
What are they doing out here?
Halt!

203
00:16:20,514 --> 00:16:22,414
Pray stop what you're doing.

204
00:16:22,539 --> 00:16:24,239
Stop building that wall.

205
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,768
- I did not ask you to defend us.
- This battle is inevitable.

206
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:31,565
You can stand by your beliefs,
but let us stand by ours.

207
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,014
Thank you
for what you're trying to do.

208
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,271
I'm sorry, but I cannot help.
My father is very...

209
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,450
Strong willed and set in tradition.

210
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,475
Many others agree with me,

211
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,893
but we were raised
under a very strict code.

212
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:50,718
We must respect it,
even if we don't agree.

213
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:57,379
- They're holding position.
- They're not going to charge us,

214
00:16:57,504 --> 00:16:59,880
not if they can hit us
from long range first.

215
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:03,262
But if we can withstand that weapon,
we'll draw them in.

216
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:04,979
Prepare to fire!

217
00:17:13,276 --> 00:17:14,907
Good-bye, Jedi.

218
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:16,441
Fire!

219
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,521
Incoming!

220
00:17:22,907 --> 00:17:24,074
Power the shields!

221
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:54,479
Now they'll have to get their hands
dirty and meet us face-to-face.

222
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:57,274
Squad one, prepare to charge.

223
00:17:57,723 --> 00:17:58,900
Prepare to charge.

224
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:02,178
Charge!

225
00:18:06,075 --> 00:18:07,825
That's a lot of clankers.

226
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,370
We got to stop them
before they get through that shield.

227
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:39,549
Five, four,

228
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,060
three,

229
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,128
two,

230
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:43,368
one,

231
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:45,011
zero.

232
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,949
Sir, the first squad
has been destroyed.

233
00:18:49,396 --> 00:18:51,495
Squad two and three, attack!

234
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:55,498
- That wasn't so tough.
- That was just the first wave.

235
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,424
Snips, get back to the village!

236
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,677
I'll take care of the new weapon.

237
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,683
That's it. We have to retreat!

238
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:19,902
Take cover.
They've breached the shield!

239
00:19:26,156 --> 00:19:28,014
They're taking out
the shield generators.

240
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,366
We have to do something.

241
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,717
Their shield is down.
Launch another shell.

242
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:58,020
Sir, there's a Jedi
heading right for us.

243
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:00,856
Then blast him, you idiot!

244
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:08,905
No survivors.

245
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:14,452
Wag Too, what are you doing?

246
00:20:14,733 --> 00:20:17,122
- We're going to help.
- I forbid this.

247
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,980
What more would you have them do

248
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:21,126
before we are allowed
to defend ourselves?

249
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:23,170
- But...
- We have to do this.

250
00:20:45,372 --> 00:20:46,174
Help!

251
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,097
I'll be defoliated!

252
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,683
There goes my promotion.

253
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,336
The weapon has been disabled.

254
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,087
Copy that, General.

255
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:37,253
- Thank you, Wag Too.
- Thank you.

256
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:39,669
Our village would certainly
have been destroyed

257
00:21:39,794 --> 00:21:41,832
without your protection.
Father,

258
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,175
I was just offering the Jedi
our thanks.

259
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,250
Perhaps we do owe you thanks,

260
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,289
but I still wonder,

261
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:50,461
at what cost?

262
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:04,223
<i>Why am I always the lucky one?</i>

263
00:22:04,897 --> 00:22:07,961
<i>As if freezing our behinds off
on this rock weren't bad enough.</i>

264
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:09,527
<i>What was that?</i>

265
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:12,552
<i>Anakin and I have a full scale war
on our hands</i>

266
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,365
<i>since chairman Cho refuses
to be reasonnable.</i>

267
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:17,284
They are savages.
Trespassers!

268
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,120
<i>We must broker a peace
between the Pantaurens</i>

269
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,692
<i>and the creatures
who call this place home.</i>

270
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:24,541
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,648
Jedi-formed rebel alliance
led by Anakin Skywalker!

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,900
The Jedi have trained a band of rebels

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,278
to fight the Separatists
on the planet Onderon.

4
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,573
With the help of the Jedi,
the rebels escaped capture

5
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,160
and infiltrated
the heavily fortified city of Iziz.

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,746
Now our heroes have launched
an armed campaign

7
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:40,999
to subvert the Separatist occupation
of the planet.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,002
The Jedi Council continue
to observe and advise

9
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,631
as the rebels strive to gain momentum
against the Separatist forces.

10
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,427
Despite the absence of civilian casualties,
public fear has ensued,

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,765
as reports of the rebels' daring strikes
circulate throughout the city.

12
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,364
- Your identification failed.
- That's not possible.

13
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,157
You are coming with us.

14
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,162
Hey!

15
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,498
- What are you doing?
- No!

16
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,871
The rebels are attacking again.

17
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,415
That is the fifth time this rotation.

18
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,881
That should give King Rash
something to think about.

19
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,842
I'm sure you've gotten his attention.

20
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,571
Dendup has been summoned
and awaits your order, my lord.

21
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,367
What about the terrorists?

22
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,871
They've attacked a checkpoint
near the canal, and two droid patrols.

23
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,082
One in Malgan Market.

24
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:49,002
If they think destroying a few droids
is going to effect change,

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,713
they've run a fool's errand.

26
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,590
One more thing, my lord.

27
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,929
The royal carriage was ambushed
soon after it left the residence.

28
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,681
Hmm.

29
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,933
An attempt on my life?

30
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,102
It appears that way.

31
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,773
Get my predecessor in here.

32
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,203
You surprise me.

33
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,457
Engaging with extremists is beneath you.

34
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,711
Do you really want
your crown back that badly?

35
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,133
I only want freedom for my people.

36
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,305
Your supporters are responsible
for terrorist acts

37
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,307
against the kingdom and our allies.

38
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,934
I didn't know that.

39
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:50,105
You've made it quite impossible
to stay informed of anything

40
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,149
outside my prison chamber.

41
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,985
Call off the attacks.

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,573
I cannot call off what I did not dictate.

43
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,744
What you are up against
is simply the will of the people.

44
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:08,165
It's up to the king
to embrace, bend or break it.

45
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:10,417
And I am no longer the king.

46
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:16,465
Stop the attacks,
or you will atone with your life.

47
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,385
It is you that must end the attacks

48
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:23,472
by ending the droid occupation.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,647
Your success will not go unnoticed.

50
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,065
- Yeah!
- All right!

51
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,441
I agree.

52
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,570
But we need to be mindful
of public perception.

53
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,655
What was your observation, Padawan?

54
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,491
The people were fearful, Master.

55
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,659
Indeed.

56
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,786
Judging from the reactions I saw today,

57
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,747
I'm afraid they will mistake your intentions.

58
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,624
We need to do more damage.

59
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:36,003
A few dozen broken-down droids
will do little to free Onderon.

60
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,338
The people need to believe
we can succeed.

61
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,883
Without their support,
our efforts are meaningless.

62
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,385
If they're afraid, they won't support us.

63
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,554
We need to assure them of our intentions.

64
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,931
I don't understand. Why are they afraid?

65
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,726
They're afraid
we're not strong enough to win.

66
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,603
We need to earn their trust.

67
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,147
You'll have plenty of time
to earn their trust.

68
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,149
All of you are going to be very busy.

69
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,320
Today was only a taste.
You'll get your chance.

70
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:06,200
In the meantime,
make the most of your victories.

71
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,619
Welcome and learn from them.

72
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,623
Perhaps if we hit something big,
give a show of strength,

73
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,375
they will overcome their fear and join us.

74
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,252
Do you have something in mind?

75
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,047
I know the perfect target.

76
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,136
I think they're ready to give
the 501 some competition.

77
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,016
Let's not get carried away, General.
Though these rebels have impressed me.

78
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,269
We will share the developments
with the Jedi Council.

79
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,688
Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor.

80
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,650
Monitor them
and report back with their progress.

81
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:44,821
Are you up for it, Snips?
Or would you like to return to Coruscant?

82
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,493
- No, Master. I want to stay.
- Good.

83
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,662
We shall continue to provide
supplies and credits,

84
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,164
but they must learn
to operate on their own.

85
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,834
Their survival depends on it.

86
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,752
Yes, Master.

87
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,046
Remember your purpose.

88
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:27,573
This power generator
feeds substations across the city.

89
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:31,618
We hit that, the entire grid falls.

90
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,203
How does that help us?

91
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,998
Battle droids are no longer
linked to Central Control.

92
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,791
They operate individually.

93
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,961
Yes, but they still need power to recharge.

94
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:44,214
If we take out this facility,
it will knock out the power grid,

95
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,799
and then it will only be a matter of time

96
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,428
until the droid army
is brought to a standstill, literally.

97
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:53,432
If you carry the plan out by nightfall,
you'll maximize your strike capability.

98
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:58,061
Okay, so we just need to figure out
how to destroy the power station.

99
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,980
We need to do more surveillance.

100
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,108
Those droids should have
all the intel we need

101
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,444
stored up in those tin cans of theirs, right?

102
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,071
- They should.
- Then I'll get us one.

103
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,554
Hey, clanker.

104
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:38,560
Uh-oh.

105
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,741
Sentries at every access point,
inside and out.

106
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,869
We can't sustain combat
against their numbers.

107
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,873
But our size makes us perfect
for mobility and surprise.

108
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:04,211
We need something with heavy firepower
if we are to blow up this facility.

109
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,757
If we give them enough trouble,
they'll call for reinforcements.

110
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,218
- Like a tank.
- Exactly.

111
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,971
Then you can provide cover
while we hijack it.

112
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,307
And then we use
their own weapon against them.

113
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,477
And bring the droid army to its knees.

114
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,990
Shh.

115
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,175
Remember the plan. We attack this patrol,

116
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,343
and hopefully they will
call in a tank for backup.

117
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,328
Let's go!

118
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,342
Patrol 118 to Central.

119
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,847
We've been ambushed by terrorists
and need reinforcements.

120
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,184
Let's hope they send a tank.

121
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,439
Hear that? They sent destroyers.

122
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,565
Move!

123
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:07,751
We're not gonna last
unless we take out those destroyers.

124
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,128
- We have to get behind them.
- Let's go.

125
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,486
Roll it slow so it gets through.

126
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:35,779
I know that.

127
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,950
- Nice job!
- You screwed me up!

128
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,180
Thanks.

129
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,810
I've never seen a destroyer
taken out that way before.

130
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:08,103
We all have to adapt.

131
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,776
There's our tank.

132
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,156
Split up!

133
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:49,853
Let's move.

134
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:26,223
Good work. Now let's get this thing
up and running again.

135
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,364
What are you waiting for?

136
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,740
Give me a second.

137
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,035
- Do you know what you're doing?
- Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

138
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,414
You boys having a problem?

139
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,708
No. No problem. Why?

140
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,751
Well, come on, we need to get moving.

141
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:56,587
Hey, who put you in charge?

142
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,548
All right, get out of the tank, hot shot.

143
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,300
This needs a woman's touch.

144
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,552
Fine, be my guest.

145
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,637
We need to get to that power generator

146
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,764
before they realize
this tank's gone missing.

147
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,433
We're running out of time.

148
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:12,603
I was gonna do that.

149
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:13,979
Uh-huh.

150
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,647
Sure.

151
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,611
Couldn't have done it better myself.

152
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:22,988
Now that's the truth.

153
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,555
I'll draw their fire. Good luck.

154
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,848
Good luck.

155
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,517
I'll cover you.

156
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,875
We're almost in position.
Ready when you are, Steela.

157
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,881
A sniper! Get her!

158
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,050
Roger, roger.

159
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,244
Look, we have reinforcements.

160
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,748
Hey, you're not a droid!
Get down from there!

161
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,604
Fire the gun!

162
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,439
This gun is recharging!

163
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,075
You're all clear.

164
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,434
Looks like all that training is paying off.

165
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:08,362
My lord, without power,
the droids will be massacred.

166
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,491
This loss will work for us.

167
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,590
There's been a power outage.

168
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,634
I've lost contact with Command.

169
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,344
Switch to infrared.

170
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,560
- It's the rebels!
- Fight for Onderon!

171
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,144
- They're destroying the droids!
- Free Onderon!

172
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,690
- Freedom!
- Fight for freedom!

173
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:47,150
- Free Onderon!
- Freedom! Freedom!

174
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,332
- For freedom!
- For Onderon!

175
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,217
- Yes!
- Freedom for Onderon!

176
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,230
- We must celebrate.
- With pleasure.

177
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:27,774
- Did you see that?
- I knew we could do it!

178
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,613
Come here, you handsome senator.

179
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,872
- Steela is a born leader.
- And quite courageous, I hear.

180
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,045
Ahsoka, remember what I told you
about staying focused.

181
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,339
I can't help it, Master.

182
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,841
- I understand.
- You do?

183
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:57,387
I do. But try to remember,
always put purpose ahead of your feelings.

184
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:01,850
This latest development will surely
get Count Dooku's attention.

185
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:04,186
He will respond harshly.

186
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,313
They will stop at nothing to find you.

187
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,024
You must adapt
and continue to confront them

188
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,442
in order to liberate Onderon.

189
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,819
- We will.
- And we shall win.

190
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,113
In that, I have no doubt.

191
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:18,575
Now you must rally the people.
You will need their support.

192
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:24,331
Your ability to influence them will also
determine your capacity to represent them,

193
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:26,792
not only on the battlefield, but off of it.

194
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,586
Against your enemies,
even within your own ranks.

195
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,381
Your commitment will inspire others.

196
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:34,967
Your conviction will lead to victory.

197
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,845
After tonight's efforts,
the people will be ready to follow.

198
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:40,806
You will need a leader
for them to rally behind.

199
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,937
They are waging a very public war.

200
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:50,899
Every trespass is an embarrassment.

201
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:56,488
Your forces cannot manage
a small band of terrorists?

202
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,200
My lord, your droids
have become ineffective

203
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,119
against the mounting rebel attacks.

204
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:05,497
I thought I could trust you to rule Onderon.

205
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:09,084
I find this report most disappointing.

206
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:16,884
It seems that the rebels are far more
organized than they were in the past.

207
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,636
The attack against
the power generators proves that.

208
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:24,641
Perhaps it's time you sent me better
reinforcements than the droids I have.

209
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,352
I will grant you this request,

210
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:31,607
and not only send you better droids
but a better general.

211
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:37,404
This is Kalani. I assure you
he will succeed where you have failed.

212
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,660
We need to build on our momentum

213
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,580
and continue our attacks
to keep them off balance.

214
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,124
We have to assure the people first.

215
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,544
If we keep disrupting their lives,
we risk alienating them.

216
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,838
We have to gain their trust.

217
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:58,509
I agree with both of you.
We can balance both.

218
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,386
We also need to recruit others to join us.

219
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,639
Onderon is ours.

220
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:06,934
We will remind everyone,
and keep reminding them,

221
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,644
until we get it back.

222
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:11,813
- Onderon is ours!
- Free Onderon!

223
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,858
- For freedom!
- Onderon is ours!

224
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,572
All in favor of Steela as our leader,

225
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,908
raise your hand.

226
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,706
Okay, looks like it's been decided.

227
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,834
You're the leader.

228
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,878
Saw...

229
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,381
Let him go.
He just needs to blow off some steam.

230
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,549
He'll be back.

231
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,385
I can't.

232
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:43,554
Why?

233
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,722
He's my brother.

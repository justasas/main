1
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,604
Ahsoka Tano captured!

2
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,607
While on the run to prove her innocence,

3
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,859
Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress

4
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:29,613
to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,992
The Jedi Council sent
Anakin Skywalker and Master Plo Koon

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,621
to track Ahsoka down
and bring her back to the Temple.

7
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:41,083
Now, captured and imprisoned,
Ahsoka faces punishment

8
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,794
for crimes she did not commit.

9
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:48,090
The Senate requests that Ahsoka Tano
be indicted for acts of treason

10
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,800
against the Republic.

11
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,761
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have,

12
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,180
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

13
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,850
Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.

14
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:03,230
I'm afraid, Master Yoda, that the Senate
believes that an internal Jedi trial

15
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,148
would seem biased.

16
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,317
Therefore, the Senate asks

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:10,988
that the Council expel Ahsoka Tano
from the Jedi Order

18
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:13,657
so that she may be put
to a Republic military tribunal,

19
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,994
where she will receive
more impartial judgment.

20
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:21,790
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

21
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,668
That would be up to the Council, General,

22
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,671
but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.

23
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:29,423
Of course.

24
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,342
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

25
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:34,595
Thank you, Admiral.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,850
Surely, we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

27
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:42,019
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

28
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,563
And yet there's evidence that she is indeed

29
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,191
the mastermind
behind the attack on the Temple.

30
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:52,029
She was found in possession
of nano-droid explosives.

31
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,156
This alone is enough to convict her.

32
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,992
I understand your sentiment, Obi-Wan,

33
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,870
but, if the Council does as you suggest,

34
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,207
it could be seen as an act
of opposition to the Senate.

35
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,667
I'm afraid we have little choice.

36
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,841
To the Chamber of Judgment,
summon Skywalker and his Padawan.

37
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,678
And, in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

38
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,778
You're not helping.

39
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,532
I'm sorry, Snips, I just...

40
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,617
I just don't know what to do.

41
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,743
It's okay.

42
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:41,745
I don't, either.

43
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:24,788
Padawan Tano, serious charges
have been levied against you.

44
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,665
How plead you?

45
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,253
Not guilty, Master.
I would never take the lives of innocents.

46
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,131
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

47
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:36,258
There is evidence to the contrary.

48
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,761
You were alone with Letta Turmond
when she died. Can you explain this?

49
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,307
Someone used the Force against her.

50
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:47,603
Which brings us to Ventress.
Can you explain your association with her?

51
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:51,523
We had a mutual understanding.
I thought she was helping me.

52
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,691
Did she help you acquire

53
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,527
the nano-droid weapons we found on you
when you were apprehended,

54
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,529
the same devices used in the bombing
of the Temple?

55
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,114
No!

56
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,327
I was set up and deceived,
as you are being deceived now.

57
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:07,623
The question is, Padawan Tano,
who is deceiving us,

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,167
Ventress, you, or someone else?

59
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,252
I am not deceiving you!

60
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,964
I would assume Ventress is,
but I can't be sure.

61
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,842
My sense is clouded.

62
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:23,013
Clouded by the dark side
these things are, Padawan Tano.

63
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,681
Dangerously clouded.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,683
But not just surrounding you,

65
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:29,853
surrounding many things, in these times.

66
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,356
You've already made your decision,
haven't you?

67
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,525
This meeting is just a formality!

68
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,490
Reached a decision we have,
though not in total agreement are we.

69
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,368
It is the Council's opinion

70
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:48,038
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano has committed
sedition against the Republic,

71
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:51,959
and thus she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

72
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,003
You can't do this!

73
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:58,173
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

74
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:02,719
and you shall forfeit all rank and privileges
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

75
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,890
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts to await your trial

76
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,977
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

77
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,189
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

78
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,583
Padmé has agreed
to represent you before the Senate.

79
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,586
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

80
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,131
I am almost certain that
the person behind this is Ventress,

81
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,258
and you know I wasn't working with her.

82
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,636
She was at the warehouse, in the room.

83
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,097
We fought, but she got away.

84
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,433
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

85
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:55,272
No, none of the clones reported
seeing Ventress at the scene.

86
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,775
I thought you said Ventress left
before you went into the warehouse.

87
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,821
That's what I thought, too,
but then she attacked me when I got inside.

88
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,240
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

89
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,994
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

90
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,623
Wait. Where are you going?
You can't leave now.

91
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,833
Yes, I can.

92
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,628
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

93
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,966
Until we hear from Anakin,
let's work on your defense.

94
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:26,762
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

95
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,139
I thought I was part of that Order,

96
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:32,476
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

97
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,646
I'm not holding out much hope
the Senate will treat me any better.

98
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,938
Anakin Skywalker.

99
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,274
I know you're behind all of this.

100
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,525
Prove it.

101
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,620
Leave me alone!

102
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,051
Tell me what happened!

103
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,764
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

104
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,767
I thought she might bring a large bounty.

105
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:57,144
Bounty?

106
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:01,815
I was going to catch your pet
and turn her over to the authorities,

107
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,735
collect whatever bounty was due.

108
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:06,486
What stopped you?

109
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,285
At first, I admit,
I was just interested in the money,

110
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,746
and a little bit of revenge.

111
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,080
But then I realized

112
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:21,251
your fallen Padawan and I
had a lot in common.

113
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,463
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

114
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,048
It's true!

115
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:30,469
My master abandoned me,

116
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,847
and that's exactly what you did to her.

117
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:39,019
You and your precious Jedi Order.

118
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,992
Ahsoka Tano,

119
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,997
you have been charged with sedition
against the Jedi Order

120
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,791
and the Republic itself.

121
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,752
This court will decide your fate.

122
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:49,464
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

123
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,515
Former Padawan Tano, I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

124
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:01,310
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple,

125
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,354
and that, once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

126
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,356
you eliminated them one by one.

127
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,109
When you are found guilty,

128
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:12,863
I ask the court that the full extent
of the law be brought down upon you,

129
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,866
including penalty of death.

130
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,292
After I left the warehouse,
after I left your little Padawan alone,

131
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,793
I was walking away

132
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,047
and I thought she came up behind me
to talk more,

133
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,423
but I was wrong.

134
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,967
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

135
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,596
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

136
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,015
It had to be another Jedi.

137
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,433
I don't believe you.

138
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,809
Believe it.

139
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,646
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

140
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,398
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

141
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,984
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

142
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,987
You're the only one Ahsoka had talked to.

143
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,823
That's not true.

144
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,242
What do you mean?

145
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,495
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

146
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,998
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

147
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:08,377
That's why we knew to go
to the warehouse in the first place.

148
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:12,381
It was this Barriss that told us to go there.

149
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,967
If you're lying, you're dead.

150
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,177
Such promises.

151
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,599
Look at the facts.

152
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,561
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

153
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,648
to reveal the name of the true mastermind
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

154
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,859
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

155
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,195
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

156
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,364
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

157
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,201
Letta Turmond was strangled to death
by way of the Force.

158
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,954
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

159
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:47,541
with a method that would
so obviously tie the murder to her?

160
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,878
A Jedi may be responsible for the murder,

161
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,881
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

162
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:58,468
Members of the court,
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

163
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,682
Well said, Senator Amidala.

164
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:06,310
However, if she is innocent,

165
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:10,856
then why was she seen conspiring with
known Separatist terrorist Asajj Ventress?

166
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:15,569
Ventress set me up.
My master will prove that.

167
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,863
And where is your master?

168
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,782
He's trying to find the real murderer.

169
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,453
Then maybe he should be looking at you!

170
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,770
Enter.

171
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,439
Barriss.

172
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,399
I need to talk to you.

173
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,734
Master Skywalker.

174
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,694
How can I help you?

175
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,198
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka
before she was arrested.

176
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,075
What did you say to her?

177
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:07,287
We've been friends for a long time.
I was only trying to help her.

178
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:08,747
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

179
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,374
It's no trouble.

180
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,668
I just need to know what you told her,

181
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,169
and if you told anyone else.

182
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,796
No.

183
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,091
I thought I had a clue for her,
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

184
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,926
Who told you I spoke to her?

185
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,971
Ventress. She told me.

186
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,851
Ventress? Isn't she the one
Ahsoka says is really behind all this?

187
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,394
That's what Ahsoka says,

188
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,646
but I think she's wrong.

189
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,190
Ventress thinks someone else is involved.

190
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,025
And you believe her?

191
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,361
Who else could it be, if not her?

192
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,905
- Surely not Ahsoka.
- No.

193
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,324
I don't think it was Ahsoka, either.

194
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,662
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth.

195
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,707
But there's only one way to find out.

196
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:55,836
Funny, those belong to Ventress.

197
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,924
You should've gotten rid of them.

198
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,384
I think they suit me.

199
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,928
Ah!

200
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:13,103
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi and think,

201
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,567
"Surely she cannot be this murderer
or saboteur that they speak of."

202
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:23,697
And yet, think of all the times
we have been fooled by the Separatists,

203
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,991
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic,

204
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:32,331
and ask yourself,
"Is this yet another Separatist scheme,

205
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:40,214
another way to rip the Jedi,
and subsequently all of us, apart?"

206
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,930
Ahsoka trusted you and you betrayed her.

207
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,224
I've learned that trust is overrated.

208
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,477
The only thing the Jedi Council believes in
is violence.

209
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,622
Cease hostilities!

210
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,672
Barriss!

211
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,400
Look out!

212
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,486
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

213
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,665
Ahsoka Tano,

214
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,169
- by an overwhelming count of...
- Chancellor!

215
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:50,928
I hope you have a reason for bursting
into our proceedings, Master Skywalker.

216
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:56,225
I'm here with evidence and a confession
from the person responsible

217
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:59,144
for all the crimes
Ahsoka has been accused of,

218
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,938
Barriss Offee,

219
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:03,315
member of the Jedi Order

220
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:04,858
and traitor.

221
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,200
Barriss, is that true?

222
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,369
Tell them the truth.

223
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,834
I did it,

224
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,961
because I've come to realize

225
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,797
what many people in the Republic
have come to realize,

226
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,675
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

227
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:33,887
that we've so lost our way
that we've become villains in this conflict,

228
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,348
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

229
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,891
all of us!

230
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:43,397
And my attack on the Temple was
an attack on what the Jedi have become,

231
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,400
an army fighting for the dark side,

232
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,319
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

233
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,738
This Republic is failing!

234
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:54,658
It's only a matter of time.

235
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,371
Take her away.

236
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,899
Ahsoka, I am so sorry,

237
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,693
about everything.

238
00:18:31,737 --> 00:18:35,657
You have our most humble apologies,
little Ahsoka.

239
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:39,036
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

240
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,664
You have shown
such great strength and resilience

241
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,876
in your struggle to prove your innocence.

242
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,087
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

243
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:54,009
This was actually your great trial.
Now we see that.

244
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,012
We understand that the Force works
in mysterious ways,

245
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,931
and, because of this trial,

246
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:02,518
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

247
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,189
Back into the Order you may come.

248
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,568
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

249
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,657
I'm asking you back.

250
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,770
I'm sorry, Master,

251
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,523
but I'm not coming back.

252
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:23,473
Ahsoka! Wait!

253
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,477
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you!

254
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:35,986
Why are you doing this?

255
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,280
The Council didn't trust me,

256
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,490
so how can I trust myself?

257
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:42,284
What about me?

258
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,828
I believed in you. I stood by you!

259
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,040
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

260
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,125
and I'm grateful for that.

261
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,377
But this isn't about you.

262
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:55,005
I can't stay here any longer,

263
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:56,632
not now.

264
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:02,387
The Jedi Order is your life.
You can't just throw it away like this!

265
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:05,224
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

266
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,725
Maybe.

267
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,436
But I have to sort this out on my own,

268
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,522
without the Council

269
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,982
and without you.

270
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,530
I understand. More than you realize,

271
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:24,618
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

272
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,080
I know.

1
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,374
Lock on to him, R2.

2
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,916
Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-

3
00:03:13,046 --> 00:03:15,252
the one crawling
with vulture droids.

4
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:17,872
I see it.
Oh, this is going to be easy.

5
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,097
<i>- Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.</i>

6
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:30,470
Mark my position.
Form your squad up behind me.

7
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,479
We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.

8
00:03:32,607 --> 00:03:34,516
Set S-foils in attack position.

9
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,449
This is where the fun begins.

10
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,576
Let them pass between us.

11
00:04:09,352 --> 00:04:11,475
They're all over me.

12
00:04:11,604 --> 00:04:14,605
<i>- Get them off my-
- I'm gonna go help them out.</i>

13
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:18,101
<i>No. They are doing their job
so we can do ours.</i>

14
00:04:32,082 --> 00:04:33,991
Missiles. Pull up.

15
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,624
- They overshot us.
- They're coming around.

16
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:48,462
All right, R4. No, no.
Nothing too fancy.

17
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:54,811
Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.

18
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:05,655
We got 'em, R2.

19
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,159
Flying is for droids.

20
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,921
<i>- I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them.</i>

21
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,167
Buzz droids.

22
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,811
R4, be careful. You have a-

23
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:42,854
Oh, dear.

24
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,821
They're shutting down
all the controls.

25
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:49,075
Move to the right so I can
get a clear shot at them.

26
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,359
<i>The mission.
Get to the command ship.</i>

27
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,902
Get the chancellor.
I'm running out of tricks here.

28
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,084
In the name of-

29
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:07,372
- Hold your fire! You're not helping.
- I agree. Bad idea.

30
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,560
I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.

31
00:06:19,855 --> 00:06:21,729
They're all over me. Anakin!

32
00:06:25,444 --> 00:06:28,445
- Move to the right.
- Hold on. You'll get us both killed.

33
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,901
Get out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

34
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:35,193
I'm not leaving
without you, Master.

35
00:06:45,798 --> 00:06:47,042
Get him, R2.

36
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,468
Watch out.

37
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,423
R2, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

38
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:06,938
- Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.

39
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:11,153
The general's command ship
is dead ahead.

40
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:15,322
Have you noticed
the shields are still up?

41
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:16,827
Sorry, Master.

42
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,079
I have a bad feeling about this.

43
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:43,810
There they are. Get them.

44
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:57,613
R2, locate the chancellor.

45
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,671
The chancellor's signal
is coming from right there-

46
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:11,833
the observation platform
at the top of that spire.

47
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,875
I sense Count Dooku.

48
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,631
- I sense a trap.
- Next move?

49
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:19,297
Spring the trap.

50
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,223
R2, go back.
I need you to stay with the ship.

51
00:08:24,353 --> 00:08:26,227
Here. Take this
and wait for orders.

52
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:44,029
What's the situation, Captain?

53
00:08:44,164 --> 00:08:48,079
Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.

54
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,496
Just as Count Dooku predicted.

55
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:57,708
Destroyers.

56
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,771
Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.

57
00:09:08,897 --> 00:09:10,771
- Roger.
- Roger, roger.

58
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,233
Those are Jedi fighters all right.

59
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:28,823
- Did you press the stop button?
- No. Did you?

60
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,247
There's more than
one way out of here.

61
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,209
We don't want to get out.
We want to get moving.

62
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,170
R2, activate elevator 31174.

63
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:41,210
<i>- Come in, R2.
- What that?</i>

64
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,219
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

65
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:46,763
<i>R2, activate
the elevator number 31174.</i>

66
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:50,602
Get back to work. That nothin'.

67
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,647
<i>Activate the elevator 31174.</i>

68
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,233
R2-

69
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,364
Always on the move.

70
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:06,446
<i>R2, switch on the comlink.
R2, can you hear me?</i>

71
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,163
<i>R2?</i>

72
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,119
R2! R2!

73
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:20,467
Stop. Stop.
R2, we need to be going up.

74
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:24,803
Hands up, Jedi.

75
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:27,089
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

76
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:31,174
<i>R2, do you hear me?
R2, we need to be going up, not down.</i>

77
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,312
Hey, you!

78
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,151
That's better.

79
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,823
You stupid little astro droid.

80
00:10:59,173 --> 00:11:00,631
Oh, it's you.

81
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,551
My eyes! My eyes!

82
00:11:04,678 --> 00:11:08,012
- What was that all about?
- R2 has been-

83
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,132
- No loose wire jokes.
- Did I say anything?

84
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,176
- He's trying.
- I didn't say anything.

85
00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:51,721
- Chancellor.
- Are you all right?

86
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:53,308
Count Dooku.

87
00:11:58,064 --> 00:12:01,896
- This time we will do it together.
- I was about to say that.

88
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:14,071
Get help. You're no match for him.
He's a Sith lord.

89
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:18,241
Chancellor Palpatine,
Sith lords are our speciality.

90
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,208
Your swords, please.

91
00:12:21,336 --> 00:12:24,788
We don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the chancellor.

92
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,130
You won't get away
this time, Dooku.

93
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:40,055
I've been looking forward to this.

94
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:43,356
My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.

95
00:12:43,484 --> 00:12:46,935
Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.

96
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:08,092
Get-

97
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:37,328
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.

98
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,409
You have hate. You have anger.

99
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,117
But you don't use them.

100
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:06,179
Good, Anakin. Good.

101
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,646
Kill him.

102
00:14:11,153 --> 00:14:12,695
Kill him now.

103
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:20,245
I shouldn't.

104
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:24,203
Do it.

105
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:39,179
You did well, Anakin.

106
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,469
He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.

107
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,682
Yes, but he was
an unarmed prisoner.

108
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,683
I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.

109
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:53,901
It is only natural. He cut off your arm,
and you wanted revenge.

110
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,152
It wasn't the first time, Anakin.

111
00:14:57,157 --> 00:15:00,906
<i>Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?</i>

112
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:07,288
Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

113
00:15:12,131 --> 00:15:14,669
Anakin, there's no time.

114
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,125
We must get off this ship
before it's too late.

115
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:22,137
- He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.

116
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,305
His fate will be the same as ours.

117
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:31,556
Prepare for attack!

118
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,769
All batteries, fire! Fire!

119
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,740
Elevator's not working.

120
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:54,124
R2, activate elevator 3224.

121
00:16:12,857 --> 00:16:16,107
- Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.

122
00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:37,502
Magnetize! Magnetize!

123
00:16:44,096 --> 00:16:47,381
Fire the emergency booster engines.

124
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,311
We're leveling out, sir.

125
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,238
Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.

126
00:17:12,373 --> 00:17:14,947
- Did I miss something?
- Hold on.

127
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,244
- What is that?
- Oops.

128
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:19,337
R2. R2, shut down the elevator.

129
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:20,663
Too late. Jump!

130
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:38,640
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still flyable.

131
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,851
R2, get down here.

132
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:43,236
<i>R2, do you copy?</i>

133
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,947
General, we found the Jedi.
They're in hallway 328.

134
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,405
Activate ray shields.

135
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,657
Ray shields.

136
00:17:58,795 --> 00:18:01,665
Wait a minute. How did this happen?
We're smarter than this.

137
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:03,126
Apparently not.

138
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:08,301
- I say patience.
- Patience?

139
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,671
Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments...

140
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:14,512
and then he'll release
the ray shields.

141
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:23,934
See? No problem.

142
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,858
Don't move.

143
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,117
Do you have a plan B?

144
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:42,119
Ah, yes.

145
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,330
The negotiator.

146
00:18:44,465 --> 00:18:48,676
General Kenobi.
We've been waiting for you.

147
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:49,965
Excuse me.

148
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:53,796
- That wasn't much of a rescue.
- You're welcome.

149
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,058
And-

150
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,218
Anakin Skywalker.

151
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>I was expecting someone with
your reputation to be a little... older.</i>

152
00:19:07,571 --> 00:19:11,485
General Grievous.
You're shorter than I expected.

153
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:15,404
Jedi scum.

154
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:18,988
We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.

155
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:28,418
Your lightsabres will make
a fine addition to my collection.

156
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,215
Not this time.
And this time, you won't escape.

157
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,388
R2.

158
00:19:38,352 --> 00:19:39,727
Crush them!

159
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,186
Make them suffer!

160
00:19:47,235 --> 00:19:48,895
Come. Now!

161
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,187
Stay at your stations!

162
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,745
Get him! Get him!

163
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:20,596
Run!

164
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,062
Don't bother with them.

165
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,479
- Keep the ship in orbit.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:41,414
You lose, General Kenobi.

167
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,310
Get out of here! Run!

168
00:21:20,493 --> 00:21:22,949
Time to abandon ship.

169
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,583
All the escape pods
have been launched.

170
00:21:32,714 --> 00:21:35,750
Grievous.
Can you fly a cruiser like this?

171
00:21:35,884 --> 00:21:38,588
- You mean, can I land what's left of it?
- Well?

172
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,552
Under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.

173
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,844
Strap yourselves in.

174
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:48,478
Open all hatches.
Extend all flaps and drag fins.

175
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:07,371
We lost something.

176
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:09,954
Not to worry.
We are still flying half a ship.

177
00:22:15,632 --> 00:22:17,209
Now we're really picking up speed.

178
00:22:25,892 --> 00:22:27,683
Eight plus 60.

179
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:31,094
- We're in the atmosphere.
- Grab that. Keep us level.

180
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:46,654
Steady.

181
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,827
Easy, R2.

182
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:55,669
5000.

183
00:22:55,796 --> 00:22:57,705
Fire ships on the left and the right.

184
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,545
<i>- We'll take you in.
- Copy that.</i>

185
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,718
- Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.

186
00:23:38,213 --> 00:23:40,170
Another happy landing.

187
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,446
Coming, Master?

188
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:15,997
No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
I have to report to the council.

189
00:24:16,126 --> 00:24:18,533
Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.

190
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,502
Hold on.
This whole operation was your idea.

191
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,752
<i>Let us not forget, Anakin, that
you rescued me from the buzz droids.</i>

192
00:24:25,885 --> 00:24:28,257
And you killed Count Dooku,
and you rescued the chancellor...

193
00:24:28,388 --> 00:24:30,297
carrying me unconscious
on your back.

194
00:24:31,057 --> 00:24:32,884
All because of your training.

195
00:24:33,017 --> 00:24:36,517
Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero...

196
00:24:36,646 --> 00:24:40,015
and you deserve your glorious day
with the politicians.

197
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,850
All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.

198
00:24:43,986 --> 00:24:45,267
Ninth time.

199
00:24:45,988 --> 00:24:50,200
That business on Cato Neimoidia doesn't
count. I'll see you at the briefing.

200
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:58,072
Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?

201
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:01,079
Yes. Thanks to your two Jedi knights.

202
00:25:01,212 --> 00:25:05,873
They killed Count Dooku, but
General Grievous has escaped once again.

203
00:25:06,008 --> 00:25:09,507
General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.

204
00:25:09,637 --> 00:25:13,930
But with Count Dooku dead,
he is the leader of the droid army.

205
00:25:14,058 --> 00:25:15,931
And I assure you...

206
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,760
the senate will vote to continue the war
as long as Grievous is alive.

207
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:23,941
Then the Jedi Council will make
finding Grievous our highest priority.

208
00:25:25,444 --> 00:25:27,317
- Watch it.
- Excuse me.

209
00:25:27,446 --> 00:25:30,400
- Come along, R2.
- The Republic cannot praise you enough.

210
00:25:30,532 --> 00:25:32,655
Thank you, Senator Organa.

211
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,323
It couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.

212
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,954
Now there I agree with you.

213
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:41,787
In fact, I could do with
a tune-up myself.

214
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:46,130
But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.

215
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:49,664
I will do everything
I can in the senate.

216
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:52,502
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.

217
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:09,317
I've missed you, Padmé.

218
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,733
There were whispers
that you'd been killed.

219
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,740
I'm all right.

220
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:19,490
It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.

221
00:26:19,622 --> 00:26:22,409
And it might have been,
if the chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.

222
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,875
I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.

223
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,624
- Wait. Not here.
- Yes, here.

224
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:32,208
I'm tired of all this deception.
I don't care if they know we're married.

225
00:26:32,344 --> 00:26:34,585
Anakin, don't say things like that.

226
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:47,020
Are you all right?
You're trembling.

227
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,273
What's going on?

228
00:26:51,362 --> 00:26:53,521
Something wonderful has happened.

229
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:58,783
Ani, I'm pregnant.

230
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:12,250
That's wonderful.

231
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,133
What are we gonna do?

232
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:22,013
We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?

233
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,601
This is a happy moment.

234
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,894
The happiest moment of my life.

235
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,875
Yes, Lord Sidious?

236
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:39,882
<i>General Grievous...</i>

237
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,087
<i>I suggest you move
the separatist leaders to Mustafar.</i>

238
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,260
It will be done, my lord.

239
00:28:49,187 --> 00:28:53,434
<i>The end of the war is near, General.</i>

240
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,151
But the loss of Count Dooku-

241
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,406
<i>His death was a necessary loss.</i>

242
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,818
<i>Soon I will have a new apprentice-</i>

243
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:11,196
<i>one far younger
and more powerful.</i>

244
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,236
Ani, I want to have our baby
back home on Naboo.

245
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:44,696
We can go to the lake country
where no one will know...

246
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,698
where we can be safe.

247
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,241
I can go early
and fix up the baby's room.

248
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:58,253
I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.

249
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,128
You are so... beautiful.

250
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,803
It's only because I'm so in love.

251
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:14,558
No, it's because
I'm so in love with you.

252
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,605
So love has blinded you?

253
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,108
That's not exactly what I meant.

254
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,737
But it's probably true.

255
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:38,451
Anakin, help me!

256
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,015
What's bothering you?

257
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:47,440
Nothing.

258
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:51,737
I remember when
I gave this to you.

259
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,028
How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?

260
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:02,078
- It was a dream.
- Bad?

261
00:32:02,878 --> 00:32:07,290
Like the ones I used to have about
my mother, just before she died.

262
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,704
And?

263
00:32:12,178 --> 00:32:14,088
And it was about you.

264
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:17,964
Tell me.

265
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:22,268
It was only a dream.

266
00:32:35,243 --> 00:32:37,152
You die in childbirth.

267
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:40,076
And the baby?

268
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:42,491
I don't know.

269
00:32:44,668 --> 00:32:48,203
- It was only a dream.
- I won't let this one become real.

270
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,963
This baby will change our lives.

271
00:32:52,927 --> 00:32:55,881
I doubt the queen will continue
to allow me to serve in the senate.

272
00:32:56,013 --> 00:32:58,385
<i>If the council discovers
you're the father, you'll be expelled-</i>

273
00:32:58,515 --> 00:33:00,425
I know. I know.

274
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,811
Do you think Obi-Wan
might be able to help us?

275
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:08,849
We don't need his help.

276
00:33:10,652 --> 00:33:13,190
Our baby is a blessing.

277
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,880
Premonitions?

278
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:32,465
Premonitions.

279
00:33:33,676 --> 00:33:35,799
These visions you have-

280
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:40,514
They're of pain, suffering.

281
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:44,352
Death.

282
00:33:44,478 --> 00:33:48,855
Yourself you speak of,
or someone you know?

283
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:52,360
Someone.

284
00:33:52,486 --> 00:33:54,360
Close to you?

285
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:57,031
Yes.

286
00:33:57,908 --> 00:34:01,740
Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.

287
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,164
The fear of loss is a path
to the dark side.

288
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:10,909
I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.

289
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:14,963
Death is a natural part of life.

290
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:19,753
Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.

291
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:23,138
Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.

292
00:34:23,266 --> 00:34:26,350
Attachment leads to jealousy.

293
00:34:26,478 --> 00:34:29,893
The shadow of greed that is.

294
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:32,229
What must I do, Master Yoda?

295
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:35,979
Train yourself to let go...

296
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:39,528
of everything you fear to lose.

297
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:52,789
You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.

298
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,502
I'm sorry. I was held up.

299
00:34:56,632 --> 00:35:00,499
- I have no excuse.
- In short, they are going very well.

300
00:35:00,636 --> 00:35:05,796
Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

301
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,807
What's wrong, then?

302
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:14,103
The senate is expected to vote more
executive powers to the chancellor today.

303
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:18,562
That can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?

304
00:35:18,695 --> 00:35:21,103
It'll make it easier
for us to end this war.

305
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:25,155
<i>Be careful of
your friend Palpatine.</i>

306
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,702
Be careful of what?

307
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,452
- He has requested your presence.
- What for?

308
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,741
He would not say.

309
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:37,412
He didn't inform the council?
That's unusual, isn't it?

310
00:35:37,547 --> 00:35:39,753
All of this is unusual.

311
00:35:39,883 --> 00:35:42,208
And it's making me feel uneasy.

312
00:35:57,317 --> 00:35:59,191
I hope you trust me, Anakin.

313
00:36:00,237 --> 00:36:01,435
Of course.

314
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:04,488
I need your help, son.

315
00:36:05,659 --> 00:36:07,652
What do you mean?

316
00:36:08,453 --> 00:36:10,327
I'm depending on you.

317
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,948
For what? I don't understand.

318
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:18,670
To be the eyes, ears
and voice of the Republic.

319
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:25,135
I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.

320
00:36:25,262 --> 00:36:26,590
Me?

321
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,764
A master?

322
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:32,015
I'm overwhelmed, sir.

323
00:36:33,937 --> 00:36:37,021
But the council elects its own members.
They'll never accept this.

324
00:36:37,148 --> 00:36:40,647
I think they will.
They need you.

325
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:43,443
More than you know.

326
00:36:53,873 --> 00:36:58,618
Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.

327
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:02,169
Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.

328
00:37:03,382 --> 00:37:04,924
I understand.

329
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,376
You are on this council...

330
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:10,085
but we do not grant you
the rank of master.

331
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,224
What?

332
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:20,684
How can you do this?
This is outrageous.

333
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,358
It's unfair.

334
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:27,564
How can you be on the council
and not be a master?

335
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:31,200
Take a seat, young Skywalker.

336
00:37:34,287 --> 00:37:35,912
Forgive me, Master.

337
00:37:40,127 --> 00:37:42,534
<i>We have surveyed
all systems in the Republic...</i>

338
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:46,371
<i>but have found no sign
of General Grievous.</i>

339
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:49,259
Hiding in the outer rim Grievous is.

340
00:37:49,386 --> 00:37:52,470
The outlying systems you must sweep.

341
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:54,803
We do not have
many ships to spare.

342
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:57,091
<i>What about the droid attack
on the Wookiees?</i>

343
00:37:58,186 --> 00:38:00,891
It is critical we send
an attack group there immediately.

344
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:04,439
He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.

345
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:07,854
Go I will.

346
00:38:07,988 --> 00:38:10,989
Good relations
with the Wookiees I have.

347
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:12,694
It's settled then.

348
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:17,821
Yoda will take a battalion of clones
to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk.

349
00:38:17,956 --> 00:38:19,996
May the Force be with us all.

350
00:38:22,252 --> 00:38:24,873
What kind of nonsense is this?

351
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,377
Put me on the council
and not make me a master?

352
00:38:27,507 --> 00:38:30,259
It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.

353
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:33,220
Calm down, Anakin.
You have been given a great honour.

354
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:36,300
To be on the council at your age-
it's never happened before.

355
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:40,844
<i>The fact of the matter is
you are too close to the chancellor.</i>

356
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:44,727
The council doesn't like it
when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

357
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:48,226
I swear to you,
I didn't ask to be put on the council.

358
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:50,567
But it's what you wanted.

359
00:38:50,697 --> 00:38:53,982
Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.

360
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:55,990
That has nothing to do with this.

361
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,036
The only reason the council
has approved your appointment...

362
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,488
is because
the chancellor trusts you.

363
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,495
And?

364
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,376
Anakin, I am on your side. I didn't
want to put you in this situation.

365
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:08,667
What situation?

366
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,089
The council wants you to report on
all the chancellor's dealings.

367
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:19,548
They want to know what he's up to.

368
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:26,097
They want me to spy
on the chancellor?

369
00:39:27,024 --> 00:39:29,693
- But that's treason.
- We are at war, Anakin.

370
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,656
Why didn't the council give me
this assignment when we were in session?

371
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:37,189
This assignment
is not to be on record.

372
00:39:38,327 --> 00:39:41,244
The chancellor
is not a bad man, Obi-Wan.

373
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:44,372
He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.

374
00:39:44,499 --> 00:39:46,575
That is why you must help us.

375
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,161
Anakin, our allegiance
is to the senate, not to its leader...

376
00:39:50,297 --> 00:39:53,962
who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.

377
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,049
The senate demanded
that he stay longer.

378
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:59,344
Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.

379
00:40:00,724 --> 00:40:03,641
You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code.

380
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,639
Against the Republic.
Against a mentor and a friend.

381
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,722
That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?

382
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,944
The council is asking you.

383
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:26,863
Anakin did not take to his
new assignment with much enthusiasm.

384
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:30,959
It's very dangerous,
putting them together.

385
00:40:31,088 --> 00:40:33,376
I don't think the boy can handle it.

386
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:35,416
I don't trust him.

387
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:39,337
With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?

388
00:40:40,096 --> 00:40:43,761
Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?

389
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,717
So the prophecy says.

390
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:51,729
A prophecy that misread
could have been.

391
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:55,442
He will not let me down.

392
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,479
He never has.

393
00:40:57,614 --> 00:41:00,614
I hope right you are.

394
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,518
Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.

395
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:32,473
I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.

396
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:37,525
Have you ever considered
that we may be on the wrong side?

397
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:39,527
What do you mean?

398
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,822
What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists...

399
00:41:44,952 --> 00:41:48,534
and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?

400
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:52,872
I don't believe that.
And you're sounding like a separatist.

401
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:57,795
This war represents a failure to listen.

402
00:41:57,923 --> 00:41:59,915
Now you're closer
to the chancellor than anyone.

403
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,300
Please, ask him to stop the fighting
and let diplomacy resume.

404
00:42:03,428 --> 00:42:05,966
Don't ask me to do that.

405
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:11,175
Make a motion in the senate,
where that kind of a request belongs.

406
00:42:12,061 --> 00:42:14,101
- What is it?
- Nothing.

407
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,272
Don't do this. Don't shut me out.
Let me help you.

408
00:42:22,071 --> 00:42:23,530
Hold me.

409
00:42:23,656 --> 00:42:25,898
Like you did by the lake on Naboo.

410
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:29,745
So long ago, when there was
nothing but our love.

411
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:34,371
No politics, no plotting, no war.

412
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:16,292
- You wanted to see me, Chancellor.
- Yes, Anakin.

413
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:18,374
Come closer. I have good news.

414
00:43:20,087 --> 00:43:21,961
Our clone intelligence units...

415
00:43:22,089 --> 00:43:25,126
have discovered
the location of General Grievous.

416
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:27,833
He's hiding in the Utapau system.

417
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,133
At last.

418
00:43:30,556 --> 00:43:33,723
We'll be able to capture
that monster and end this war.

419
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:37,184
I would worry about
the collective wisdom of the council...

420
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:39,685
if it didn't select you
for this assignment.

421
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:43,149
You're the best choice, by far.

422
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:47,655
Sit down.

423
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:48,979
Leave us.

424
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:08,007
You know I'm not able
to rely on the Jedi Council.

425
00:44:09,803 --> 00:44:13,136
If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.

426
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,175
I'm not sure I understand.

427
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:19,974
You must sense
what I have come to suspect.

428
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:23,473
The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.

429
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:26,768
They're planning to betray me.

430
00:44:27,487 --> 00:44:29,859
- I don't think that-
- Anakin.

431
00:44:31,074 --> 00:44:32,983
Search your feelings.

432
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:37,741
You know, don't you?

433
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:44,042
I know they don't trust you.

434
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:47,455
Or the senate. Or the Republic.

435
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:50,163
Or democracy, for that matter.

436
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:55,297
I have to admit,
my trust in them has been shaken.

437
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:56,890
Why?

438
00:44:59,102 --> 00:45:03,349
They asked you to do something that
made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

439
00:45:06,401 --> 00:45:09,236
They asked you to spy on me,
didn't they?

440
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:18,284
I don't know what to say.

441
00:45:18,413 --> 00:45:21,864
Remember back
to your early teachings.

442
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:26,367
All who gain power
are afraid to lose it.

443
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:31,130
- Even the Jedi.
- The Jedi use their power for good.

444
00:45:31,259 --> 00:45:33,381
Good is a point of view, Anakin.

445
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:38,671
The Sith and the Jedi
are similar in almost every way...

446
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:43,478
including their quest
for greater power.

447
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:48,023
The Sith rely on their passion
for their strength.

448
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,902
They think inwards-
only about themselves.

449
00:45:52,112 --> 00:45:54,354
And the Jedi don't?

450
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,024
The Jedi are selfless.
They only care about others.

451
00:46:09,212 --> 00:46:14,170
Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?

452
00:46:19,306 --> 00:46:23,350
I thought not. It's not a story
the Jedi would tell you.

453
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:26,768
It's a Sith legend.

454
00:46:27,731 --> 00:46:31,895
Darth Plagueis was
a dark lord of the Sith...

455
00:46:32,026 --> 00:46:34,897
so powerful and so wise...

456
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:39,857
he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...

457
00:46:39,993 --> 00:46:43,159
to create... life.

458
00:46:44,831 --> 00:46:47,867
He had such a knowledge
of the dark side...

459
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,461
he could even keep
the ones he cared about...

460
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:55,048
from dying.

461
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:03,129
He could actually...
save people from death?

462
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:08,512
The dark side of the Force is
a pathway to many abilities...

463
00:47:08,646 --> 00:47:12,857
some consider to be unnatural.

464
00:47:13,942 --> 00:47:15,816
What happened to him?

465
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:18,986
He became so powerful...

466
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,359
the only thing he was afraid of was...

467
00:47:23,578 --> 00:47:25,452
losing his power.

468
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,703
Which eventually, of course, he did.

469
00:47:28,916 --> 00:47:34,077
Unfortunately, he taught
his apprentice everything he knew.

470
00:47:34,881 --> 00:47:37,502
Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.

471
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,463
It's ironic.

472
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:44,719
He could save others from death...

473
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,926
but not himself.

474
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:54,644
Is it possible to learn this power?

475
00:47:58,487 --> 00:48:00,610
Not from a Jedi.

476
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:19,379
<i>All Red units, over here!</i>

477
00:48:31,186 --> 00:48:33,558
<i>Palpatine thinks General Grievous
is on Utapau?</i>

478
00:48:34,397 --> 00:48:36,271
<i>A partial message was intercepted...</i>

479
00:48:36,399 --> 00:48:38,855
<i>in a diplomatic packet
from the chairman of Utapau.</i>

480
00:48:41,446 --> 00:48:43,522
<i>Act on this we must.</i>

481
00:48:44,782 --> 00:48:48,365
<i>The capture of General Grievous
will end this war.</i>

482
00:48:49,495 --> 00:48:52,282
<i>Quickly and decisively
we should proceed.</i>

483
00:48:53,207 --> 00:48:57,419
The chancellor has requested...
that I lead the campaign.

484
00:48:58,212 --> 00:49:00,834
The council will make up
its own mind who is to go...

485
00:49:00,965 --> 00:49:02,922
not the chancellor.

486
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,961
<i>A master is needed,
with more experience.</i>

487
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:11,466
<i>I concur.
Master Kenobi should go.</i>

488
00:49:12,685 --> 00:49:14,096
<i>I agree.</i>

489
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:15,343
<i>Aye.</i>

490
00:49:15,479 --> 00:49:17,021
Aye.

491
00:49:17,147 --> 00:49:19,057
<i>Very well. Council adjourned.</i>

492
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:29,660
The droids have started up
their main power generators.

493
00:49:30,494 --> 00:49:35,239
- Then now the time is, Commander.
- Yes, sir.

494
00:49:47,929 --> 00:49:49,387
Charge!

495
00:50:04,528 --> 00:50:06,437
<i>Head for cover!</i>

496
00:50:21,879 --> 00:50:24,749
- You're gonna need me on this one.
- I agree.

497
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:27,717
However, it may turn out
just to be a wild bantha chase.

498
00:50:27,843 --> 00:50:28,957
Master.

499
00:50:30,887 --> 00:50:36,226
I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.

500
00:50:36,351 --> 00:50:40,099
I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.

501
00:50:40,855 --> 00:50:43,181
I've just been so frustrated
with the council.

502
00:50:46,528 --> 00:50:50,228
You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.

503
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:52,938
<i>I have trained you since
you were a small boy.</i>

504
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:55,152
I have taught you
everything I know.

505
00:50:55,286 --> 00:50:59,035
And you have become a far greater
Jedi than I could ever hope to be.

506
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:01,825
But be patient, Anakin.

507
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,877
It will not be long before
the council makes you a Jedi master.

508
00:51:13,262 --> 00:51:16,512
Obi-Wan.
May the Force be with you.

509
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,511
Goodbye, old friend.
May the Force be with you.

510
00:51:42,124 --> 00:51:46,667
Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.

511
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:48,420
On the far side.

512
00:51:48,547 --> 00:51:50,835
I'll keep them distracted
until you get there.

513
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:54,383
- Just don't take too long.
- Come on. When have I ever let you down?

514
00:51:55,805 --> 00:52:00,930
Very well. The burden is on me not to
destroy all the droids until you arrive.

515
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,120
Save your energy.

516
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:30,581
I can't.

517
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,457
Don't give up, Padmé.

518
00:52:45,937 --> 00:52:47,811
Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

519
00:52:48,523 --> 00:52:50,563
He came by this morning.

520
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:53,859
What did he want?

521
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:55,896
He's worried about you.

522
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:00,650
He says you've been
under a lot of stress.

523
00:53:03,538 --> 00:53:05,198
I feel lost.

524
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:09,494
Lost? What do you mean?

525
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,793
Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.

526
00:53:14,882 --> 00:53:17,290
They trust you with their lives.

527
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:20,512
Something's happening.

528
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:23,839
I'm not the Jedi I should be.

529
00:53:26,227 --> 00:53:28,136
I want more.

530
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:31,270
And I know I shouldn't.

531
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,358
You expect too much of yourself.

532
00:53:39,365 --> 00:53:42,531
- I found a way to save you.
- Save me?

533
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:44,569
From my nightmares.

534
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:46,612
Is that what's bothering you?

535
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:49,574
I won't lose you, Padmé.

536
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,493
I'm not gonna die in childbirth, Ani.

537
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:55,035
- I promise you.
- No, I promise you.

538
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:41,379
Greetings, young Jedi.

539
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,926
What brings you to
our remote sanctuary?

540
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:46,964
Unfortunately, the war.

541
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:51,633
There's no war here-
unless you brought it with you.

542
00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:54,936
With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...

543
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:59,976
and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.

544
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:12,245
He is here.
We are being held hostage.

545
00:55:12,373 --> 00:55:15,244
- They are watching us.
- I understand.

546
00:55:15,376 --> 00:55:20,168
Tenth level,
thousands of battle droids.

547
00:55:20,298 --> 00:55:22,705
Tell your people to take shelter.

548
00:55:22,842 --> 00:55:25,796
If you have warriors, now is the time.

549
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:40,942
Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.

550
00:55:42,903 --> 00:55:46,983
- Is he bringing additional warriors?
- He didn't say.

551
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:34,532
It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.

552
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:42,373
I am sending you to the Mustafar system
in the outer rim.

553
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:52,175
It is a volcanic planet.

554
00:56:52,306 --> 00:56:55,591
- You will be safe there.
- Safe?

555
00:56:56,435 --> 00:56:59,685
Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.

556
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:04,226
Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.

557
00:57:05,151 --> 00:57:10,276
Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not
found yourself in my grip.

558
00:57:13,785 --> 00:57:16,406
Your ship is waiting.

559
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:35,550
Hello there.

560
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:39,933
General Kenobi.

561
00:57:42,897 --> 00:57:45,435
You are a bold one.

562
00:57:47,485 --> 00:57:48,943
Kill him.

563
00:58:04,793 --> 00:58:06,204
Back away.

564
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:10,915
I will deal with
this Jedi slime myself.

565
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,508
Your move.

566
00:58:13,343 --> 00:58:15,051
You fool.

567
00:58:15,178 --> 00:58:20,967
I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.

568
00:58:27,524 --> 00:58:29,979
Attack, Kenobi.

569
00:59:46,352 --> 00:59:48,641
Army or not...

570
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:53,848
<i>you must realize you are doomed.</i>

571
00:59:53,984 --> 00:59:55,942
I don't think so.

572
01:00:54,377 --> 01:00:56,120
<i>Cover that corner.</i>

573
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:04,216
<i>Master Windu, may I interrupt?</i>

574
01:01:04,345 --> 01:01:07,097
<i>General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous...</i>

575
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:09,466
<i>and we have begun our attack.</i>

576
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:11,309
Thank you, Commander.

577
01:01:11,436 --> 01:01:15,516
Anakin, deliver this report
to the chancellor.

578
01:01:15,649 --> 01:01:17,891
His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.

579
01:01:18,026 --> 01:01:19,485
Yes, Master.

580
01:01:26,951 --> 01:01:29,407
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

581
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:32,785
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.

582
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,706
<i>If he does not give up
his emergency powers...</i>

583
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,709
<i>after the destruction of Grievous...</i>

584
01:01:37,837 --> 01:01:40,043
<i>then he should be
removed from office.</i>

585
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:44,040
The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...

586
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:46,050
in order to secure
a peaceful transition.

587
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:50,639
<i>To a dark place this line
of thought will carry us.</i>

588
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:55,598
<i>Great care we must take.</i>

589
01:02:02,445 --> 01:02:03,903
Chancellor.

590
01:02:04,697 --> 01:02:07,188
We've just received a report
from Master Kenobi.

591
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,946
He has engaged General Grievous.

592
01:02:10,077 --> 01:02:13,411
We can only hope that Master Kenobi
is up to the challenge.

593
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:17,248
I should be there with him.

594
01:02:17,376 --> 01:02:19,701
It's upsetting to me
to see that the council...

595
01:02:19,837 --> 01:02:21,876
<i>doesn't seem to fully appreciate
your talents.</i>

596
01:02:23,215 --> 01:02:27,295
Don't you wonder why
they won't make you a Jedi master?

597
01:02:29,012 --> 01:02:30,969
I wish I knew.

598
01:02:32,307 --> 01:02:34,798
More and more I get
the feeling that...

599
01:02:34,935 --> 01:02:37,141
I'm being excluded
from the council.

600
01:02:44,152 --> 01:02:48,066
I know there are things about the Force
that they're not telling me.

601
01:02:50,325 --> 01:02:52,732
They don't trust you, Anakin.

602
01:02:53,495 --> 01:02:55,487
They see your future.

603
01:02:55,622 --> 01:02:59,489
They know your power
will be too strong to control.

604
01:03:00,668 --> 01:03:05,710
You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.

605
01:03:07,759 --> 01:03:11,887
Let me help you to know
the subtleties of the Force.

606
01:03:12,638 --> 01:03:14,761
How do you know
the ways of the Force?

607
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:18,844
My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.

608
01:03:19,645 --> 01:03:22,599
Even the nature of the dark side.

609
01:03:24,608 --> 01:03:26,935
You know the dark side?

610
01:03:29,573 --> 01:03:32,858
If one is to understand
the great mystery...

611
01:03:32,993 --> 01:03:35,365
one must study all its aspects...

612
01:03:35,495 --> 01:03:38,615
not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.

613
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:42,494
If you wish to become
a complete and wise leader...

614
01:03:42,627 --> 01:03:46,292
<i>you must embrace
a larger view of the Force.</i>

615
01:03:47,048 --> 01:03:49,041
Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin.

616
01:03:50,093 --> 01:03:55,253
Only through me can you achieve
a power greater than any Jedi.

617
01:03:56,015 --> 01:03:58,636
Learn to know
the dark side of the Force...

618
01:03:58,768 --> 01:04:02,386
and you will be able to
save your wife...

619
01:04:02,522 --> 01:04:04,561
from certain death.

620
01:04:05,691 --> 01:04:07,565
What did you say?

621
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:11,311
Use my knowledge. I beg you.

622
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:15,190
You're the Sith lord.

623
01:04:15,326 --> 01:04:19,158
I know what's been troubling you.
Listen to me.

624
01:04:20,164 --> 01:04:23,829
Don't continue to be a pawn
of the Jedi Council.

625
01:04:26,003 --> 01:04:29,419
<i>Ever since I've known you,
you've been searching for a life...</i>

626
01:04:29,548 --> 01:04:32,086
greater than that
of an ordinary Jedi.

627
01:04:32,217 --> 01:04:34,589
A life of significance...

628
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,178
of conscience.

629
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:45,473
- Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.

630
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:48,937
I know you would.

631
01:04:49,067 --> 01:04:52,851
I can feel your anger.

632
01:04:52,988 --> 01:04:55,657
It gives you focus...

633
01:04:55,782 --> 01:04:58,107
makes you stronger.

634
01:05:04,415 --> 01:05:06,741
I'm going to turn you over
to the Jedi Council.

635
01:05:06,876 --> 01:05:08,501
Of course. You should.

636
01:05:08,628 --> 01:05:11,629
But you're not sure
of their intentions, are you?

637
01:05:11,756 --> 01:05:14,247
I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.

638
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:17,798
You have great wisdom, Anakin.

639
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:21,547
Know the power of the dark side.

640
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:24,434
Power to save Padmé.

641
01:07:32,979 --> 01:07:34,141
So uncivilized.

642
01:07:41,654 --> 01:07:43,646
Master Windu,
I must talk to you.

643
01:07:43,781 --> 01:07:47,565
Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.

644
01:07:47,701 --> 01:07:49,575
We're on our way to make sure...

645
01:07:49,703 --> 01:07:51,945
the chancellor returns
emergency power back to the senate.

646
01:07:52,081 --> 01:07:55,699
He won't give up his power.
I've just learned a terrible truth.

647
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,957
I think Chancellor Palpatine
is a Sith lord.

648
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:00,963
A Sith lord?

649
01:08:01,089 --> 01:08:03,925
Yes. The one we've been looking for.

650
01:08:04,052 --> 01:08:07,053
- How do you know this?
- He knows the ways of the Force.

651
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:10,220
He's been trained
to use the dark side.

652
01:08:10,350 --> 01:08:13,137
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

653
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:16,810
Then our worst fears
have been realized.

654
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:20,391
We must move quickly
if the Jedi order is to survive.

655
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:22,934
Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.

656
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:25,312
You'll need my help
if you're going to arrest him.

657
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:28,365
For you own good,
stay out of this affair.

658
01:08:28,492 --> 01:08:31,244
I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.

659
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:33,493
There is much fear
that clouds your judgment.

660
01:08:33,622 --> 01:08:35,579
- I must go, Master.
- No.

661
01:08:37,793 --> 01:08:41,743
If what you've told me is true,
you will have gained my trust.

662
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,418
But for now, remain here.

663
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:48,421
Wait in the council chambers
until we return.

664
01:08:50,722 --> 01:08:51,967
Yes, Master.

665
01:09:22,086 --> 01:09:24,328
<i>You do know, don't you...</i>

666
01:09:24,464 --> 01:09:26,789
<i>if the Jedi destroy me...</i>

667
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:30,874
<i>any chance of saving her
will be lost.</i>

668
01:10:59,808 --> 01:11:04,221
Master Windu. I take it General Grievous
has been destroyed then.

669
01:11:05,188 --> 01:11:07,596
I must say you're here
sooner than expected.

670
01:11:07,733 --> 01:11:11,315
In the name of
the Galactic Senate of the Republic...

671
01:11:11,445 --> 01:11:13,354
you're under arrest, Chancellor.

672
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:16,062
Are you threatening me,
Master Jedi?

673
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:18,108
The senate will decide your fate.

674
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:22,075
- I am the senate.
- Not yet.

675
01:11:27,419 --> 01:11:29,744
It's treason then.

676
01:13:08,727 --> 01:13:12,262
You are under arrest, my lord.

677
01:13:13,398 --> 01:13:17,692
Anakin, I told you it would
come to this. I was right.

678
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:19,942
The Jedi are taking over.

679
01:13:20,072 --> 01:13:22,527
The oppression of the Sith
will never return.

680
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:24,864
You have lost.

681
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:30,656
You will die!

682
01:13:33,418 --> 01:13:35,292
He's a traitor!

683
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,578
He is the traitor!

684
01:13:40,758 --> 01:13:44,922
I have the power
to save the one you love.

685
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:47,839
You must choose.

686
01:13:48,933 --> 01:13:51,506
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

687
01:13:52,603 --> 01:13:55,225
Don't let him kill me.

688
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:01,064
I can't hold it any longer.

689
01:14:02,405 --> 01:14:04,481
I can't. I'm weak.

690
01:14:04,615 --> 01:14:06,572
I'm too weak.

691
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:10,699
Help me. Help me!

692
01:14:15,209 --> 01:14:17,367
I can't hold on any longer.

693
01:14:17,503 --> 01:14:21,085
I am going to end this
once and for all.

694
01:14:21,215 --> 01:14:22,673
You can't.

695
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,757
He must stand trial.

696
01:14:25,803 --> 01:14:28,210
He has control of
the senate and the courts.

697
01:14:28,347 --> 01:14:30,553
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

698
01:14:30,682 --> 01:14:32,924
I'm too weak.

699
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:36,642
- Don't kill me. Please.
- It's not the Jedi way.

700
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,266
He must live.

701
01:14:41,401 --> 01:14:43,939
- Please don't.
- I need him.

702
01:14:44,988 --> 01:14:46,067
Please don't!

703
01:14:53,496 --> 01:14:55,121
Power!

704
01:15:01,672 --> 01:15:06,334
Unlimited power!

705
01:15:17,479 --> 01:15:19,519
What have I done?

706
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:31,737
You're fulfilling your destiny, Anakin.

707
01:15:32,953 --> 01:15:35,657
Become my apprentice.

708
01:15:35,789 --> 01:15:41,210
Learn to use
the dark side of the Force.

709
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:46,834
I will do whatever you ask.

710
01:15:49,052 --> 01:15:51,459
Good.

711
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:55,754
Just help me save Padmé's life.

712
01:15:57,727 --> 01:16:00,099
I can't live without her.

713
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:08,648
To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved...

714
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:11,733
but if we work together...

715
01:16:11,866 --> 01:16:15,863
I know we can discover the secret.

716
01:16:17,329 --> 01:16:19,322
I pledge myself...

717
01:16:21,041 --> 01:16:22,915
to your teachings.

718
01:16:24,169 --> 01:16:25,580
Good.

719
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:28,880
Good.

720
01:16:37,141 --> 01:16:41,553
The Force is strong with you.

721
01:16:41,687 --> 01:16:47,226
A powerful Sith you will become.

722
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:51,606
Henceforth you shall be known as...

723
01:16:51,738 --> 01:16:55,605
Darth... Vader.

724
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:03,581
Thank you, my master.

725
01:17:05,794 --> 01:17:07,252
Rise.

726
01:17:21,727 --> 01:17:25,855
Because the council did not trust you,
my young apprentice...

727
01:17:27,441 --> 01:17:32,186
I believe you are the only Jedi
with no knowledge of this plot.

728
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:36,235
When the Jedi learn
what has transpired here...

729
01:17:36,366 --> 01:17:40,280
they will kill us,
along with all the senators.

730
01:17:41,163 --> 01:17:42,538
I agree.

731
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:47,115
The council's next move
will be against the senate.

732
01:17:47,252 --> 01:17:49,921
Every single Jedi...

733
01:17:50,046 --> 01:17:53,296
including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi...

734
01:17:53,425 --> 01:17:56,959
is now an enemy of the Republic.

735
01:17:58,012 --> 01:17:59,970
I understand, Master.

736
01:18:00,765 --> 01:18:02,674
We must move quickly.

737
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:04,718
The Jedi are relentless.

738
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:10,641
If they are not all destroyed,
it will be civil war without end.

739
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:16,144
First I want you to
go to the Jedi temple.

740
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,276
We will catch them off-balance.

741
01:18:20,493 --> 01:18:24,360
Do what must be done, Lord Vader.

742
01:18:24,497 --> 01:18:27,866
Do not hesitate. Show no mercy.

743
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:33,329
Only then will you be strong enough
with the dark side...

744
01:18:33,464 --> 01:18:35,456
to save Padmé.

745
01:18:36,592 --> 01:18:40,424
What about the other Jedi
spread across the galaxy?

746
01:18:40,554 --> 01:18:43,638
Their betrayal will be dealt with.

747
01:18:45,559 --> 01:18:48,809
After you have killed
all the Jedi in the temple...

748
01:18:48,937 --> 01:18:51,607
go to the Mustafar system.

749
01:18:51,732 --> 01:18:54,982
Wipe out Viceroy Gunray...

750
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:58,526
and the other
separatist leaders.

751
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:04,528
Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!

752
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:07,495
And...

753
01:19:07,622 --> 01:19:12,699
we shall have... peace.

754
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,794
Sergeant, over here!

755
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,749
Hurry! All of them!

756
01:20:03,553 --> 01:20:05,427
<i>All Red units, let's move it!</i>

757
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:07,429
<i>Come on. Let's go!</i>

758
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,313
Commander, contact your troops.

759
01:20:23,447 --> 01:20:25,357
Tell them to move to the higher levels.

760
01:20:25,491 --> 01:20:27,365
Very good, sir.

761
01:20:27,493 --> 01:20:29,616
By the way,
I think you'll be needing this.

762
01:20:30,454 --> 01:20:33,989
Thank you, Cody. Let's get a move on.
We've got a battle to win.

763
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,287
Yes, sir.

764
01:20:42,091 --> 01:20:43,549
<i>Commander Cody...</i>

765
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,545
the time has come.

766
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,926
Execute order 66.

767
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:54,594
Yes, my lord.

768
01:20:58,482 --> 01:20:59,810
Blast him!

769
01:21:26,801 --> 01:21:28,177
Come on!

770
01:22:18,603 --> 01:22:21,888
<i>Execute order 66.</i>

771
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:24,523
It will be done, my lord.

772
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:09,316
It will be done, my lord.

773
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:48,561
Master Skywalker,
there are too many of them.

774
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,648
What are we going to do?

775
01:24:01,162 --> 01:24:05,290
The chancellor's office indicated Master
Anakin returned to the Jedi temple.

776
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:08,500
Don't worry.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

777
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,777
- What's going on here?
- There's been a rebellion, sir.

778
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,483
Don't worry.
The situation is under control.

779
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,826
I'm sorry, sir.
It's time for you to leave.

780
01:24:48,584 --> 01:24:50,541
And so it is.

781
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,132
Get him!

782
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:15,566
Don't worry about him.
Let him go.

783
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:45,388
All these Wookiees are dead.
Move to the east.

784
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:46,974
Yes, sir.

785
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:56,981
Goodbye, Tarfful.

786
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,067
Goodbye, Chewbacca.

787
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,779
Miss you I will.

788
01:26:40,820 --> 01:26:43,145
Hopefully we'll be able to
intercept a few Jedi...

789
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,570
before they walk into
this catastrophe.

790
01:26:51,330 --> 01:26:53,240
Did you find Kenobi?

791
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,283
Sir, no one could have
survived that fall.

792
01:26:56,335 --> 01:26:58,660
Start loading your men on the ships.

793
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:00,255
Move it.

794
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,573
Emergency code 913.

795
01:27:35,707 --> 01:27:37,581
I have no contact
on any frequency.

796
01:27:40,337 --> 01:27:41,747
<i>Master Kenobi.</i>

797
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:43,837
<i>- Repeat.
- Master Kenobi.</i>

798
01:27:43,965 --> 01:27:47,879
Senator Organa. My clone troops
turned on me. I need help.

799
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:50,760
<i>We have just rescued Master Yoda.</i>

800
01:27:50,889 --> 01:27:52,965
<i>It appears this ambush
has happened everywhere.</i>

801
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:55,222
<i>We're sending you our coordinates.</i>

802
01:28:02,984 --> 01:28:04,858
Hush! Not so loud.

803
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:07,987
Are you all right? I heard there was
an attack on the Jedi temple.

804
01:28:08,114 --> 01:28:10,486
- You could see the smoke from here.
- I'm fine.

805
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:12,490
I came to see if
you and the baby are safe.

806
01:28:12,618 --> 01:28:14,243
What's happening?

807
01:28:15,121 --> 01:28:17,197
The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.

808
01:28:17,957 --> 01:28:19,831
I can't believe that.

809
01:28:19,959 --> 01:28:23,494
I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

810
01:28:26,298 --> 01:28:28,090
What are you gonna do?

811
01:28:36,809 --> 01:28:38,967
I will not betray the Republic.

812
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,889
My loyalties lie
with the chancellor...

813
01:28:44,066 --> 01:28:46,770
and with the senate
and with you.

814
01:28:47,569 --> 01:28:50,773
- What about Obi-Wan?
- I don't know.

815
01:28:51,532 --> 01:28:53,608
Many Jedi have been killed.

816
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:56,578
We can only hope that
he's remained loyal to the chancellor.

817
01:28:57,663 --> 01:28:59,989
Anakin, I'm afraid.

818
01:29:03,002 --> 01:29:05,041
Have faith, my love.

819
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,459
Everything will soon be set right.

820
01:29:08,257 --> 01:29:11,341
The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.

821
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:14,304
The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.

822
01:29:15,055 --> 01:29:18,887
I'm going there to end this war.
Wait for me until I return.

823
01:29:19,018 --> 01:29:21,390
Things will be different.
I promise.

824
01:29:27,234 --> 01:29:29,191
Please, wait for me.

825
01:29:33,282 --> 01:29:35,986
Well, he is under
a lot of stress, R2.

826
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,154
Take care, my little friend.

827
01:29:44,459 --> 01:29:48,124
Oh, my lady,
is there anything I might do?

828
01:29:48,255 --> 01:29:50,793
No, thank you, 3PO.

829
01:29:53,176 --> 01:29:55,584
I feel so helpless.

830
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,781
How many other Jedi
have managed to survive?

831
01:30:21,913 --> 01:30:24,450
Heard from no one have we.

832
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:28,417
I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.

833
01:30:28,544 --> 01:30:30,418
That's why I went looking for Yoda.

834
01:30:30,546 --> 01:30:32,954
Have we had any contact
from the temple?

835
01:30:33,090 --> 01:30:36,044
Received a coded
retreat message we have.

836
01:30:36,927 --> 01:30:40,177
It requests all Jedi
to return to the temple.

837
01:30:40,306 --> 01:30:43,721
- It says the war is over.
- Then we must go back.

838
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:47,350
If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.

839
01:30:48,522 --> 01:30:52,270
Suggest dismantling
the coded signal, do you?

840
01:30:52,401 --> 01:30:55,106
Yes, Master.
There is too much at stake.

841
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:57,780
I agree.

842
01:30:57,906 --> 01:31:01,489
And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

843
01:31:22,473 --> 01:31:25,889
The plan has gone
as you had promised, my lord.

844
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:28,770
<i>You have done well, Viceroy.</i>

845
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:34,685
<i>When my new apprentice
Darth Vader arrives...</i>

846
01:31:34,818 --> 01:31:38,318
<i>he will take care of you.</i>

847
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:53,170
We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.

848
01:31:53,211 --> 01:31:55,120
- Send it through.
- Yes, sir.

849
01:31:56,882 --> 01:32:01,543
<i>Senator Organa, the supreme chancellor
requests your presence...</i>

850
01:32:01,678 --> 01:32:03,635
<i>at a special session of Congress.</i>

851
01:32:03,763 --> 01:32:07,298
<i>- I will be there.
- He'll be expecting you.</i>

852
01:32:10,311 --> 01:32:13,561
- Could be a trap.
- I don't think so.

853
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:16,776
The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...

854
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:18,810
without keeping
the senate intact.

855
01:32:19,654 --> 01:32:22,939
If a special session
of Congress there is...

856
01:32:23,074 --> 01:32:26,359
easier for us to enter
the Jedi temple it will be.

857
01:33:04,865 --> 01:33:06,822
R2, stay with the ship.

858
01:33:32,268 --> 01:33:35,269
Welcome, Lord Vader.
We've been expecting you.

859
01:34:07,135 --> 01:34:11,631
And the Jedi rebellion
has been foiled.

860
01:34:11,765 --> 01:34:12,807
What's happened?

861
01:34:12,932 --> 01:34:17,429
The chancellor's been elaborating on a
plot by the Jedi to overthrow the senate.

862
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:23,018
The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.

863
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:41,288
Not even the younglings survived.

864
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:47,758
Killed not by clones this Padawan.

865
01:34:48,801 --> 01:34:51,422
By a lightsabre he was.

866
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:59,852
Who?

867
01:34:59,979 --> 01:35:01,852
Who could have done this?

868
01:35:12,574 --> 01:35:15,741
The attempt on my life...

869
01:35:15,869 --> 01:35:20,745
has left me scarred and deformed.

870
01:35:21,708 --> 01:35:24,579
But I assure you.

871
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:29,420
My resolve has never been stronger!

872
01:35:33,637 --> 01:35:34,835
Stop!

873
01:35:47,818 --> 01:35:53,441
In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...

874
01:35:53,574 --> 01:35:57,441
the Republic will be reorganized...

875
01:35:57,578 --> 01:36:03,034
into the first Galactic Empire!

876
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:09,795
For a safe and secure society.

877
01:36:19,224 --> 01:36:21,263
So this is how liberty dies.

878
01:36:22,018 --> 01:36:24,723
With thunderous applause.

879
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:29,307
The war is over.

880
01:36:29,442 --> 01:36:33,570
Lord Sidious promised us peace.
We only want-

881
01:36:41,704 --> 01:36:46,366
I have recalibrated the code,
warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

882
01:36:46,501 --> 01:36:48,908
For the clones...

883
01:36:49,045 --> 01:36:53,125
to discover the recalibration
a long time it will take.

884
01:37:05,477 --> 01:37:06,936
Wait. Master.

885
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:10,806
There is something I must know.

886
01:37:16,947 --> 01:37:21,360
If into the security recordings you go,
only pain will you find.

887
01:37:21,493 --> 01:37:24,031
I must know the truth, Master.

888
01:37:31,837 --> 01:37:33,746
It can't be.

889
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:35,754
It can't be.

890
01:37:35,882 --> 01:37:39,927
<i>You have done well,
my new apprentice.</i>

891
01:37:40,053 --> 01:37:43,054
<i>Now, Lord Vader...</i>

892
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:46,680
<i>go and bring peace to the Empire.</i>

893
01:37:46,810 --> 01:37:48,968
I can't watch any more.

894
01:37:49,729 --> 01:37:53,643
Destroy the Sith we must.

895
01:37:55,443 --> 01:37:57,519
Send me to kill the emperor.

896
01:37:57,654 --> 01:37:59,895
I will not kill Anakin.

897
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:04,740
To fight this Lord Sidious,
strong enough you are not.

898
01:38:04,870 --> 01:38:08,120
He is like my brother.
I cannot do it.

899
01:38:08,874 --> 01:38:13,915
Twisted by the dark side
young Skywalker has become.

900
01:38:14,046 --> 01:38:17,415
The boy you trained, gone he is.

901
01:38:17,549 --> 01:38:20,420
Consumed by Darth Vader.

902
01:38:20,552 --> 01:38:23,553
I do not know where
the emperor has sent him.

903
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:25,886
I don't know where to look.

904
01:38:27,225 --> 01:38:30,890
Use your feelings, Obi-Wan,
and find him you will.

905
01:38:41,447 --> 01:38:43,440
When was the last time
you saw him?

906
01:38:44,158 --> 01:38:47,527
- Yesterday.
- And do you know where he is now?

907
01:38:50,707 --> 01:38:54,040
Padmé, I need your help.

908
01:38:54,752 --> 01:38:57,373
- He is in grave danger.
- From the Sith?

909
01:38:58,172 --> 01:38:59,631
From himself.

910
01:39:04,095 --> 01:39:06,467
Anakin has turned to the dark side.

911
01:39:06,597 --> 01:39:10,048
You're wrong.
How could you even say that?

912
01:39:12,853 --> 01:39:17,848
I have seen
a security hologram... of him...

913
01:39:19,485 --> 01:39:21,193
killing younglings.

914
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:24,356
Not Anakin. He couldn't.

915
01:39:25,115 --> 01:39:27,404
He was deceived by a lie.
We all were.

916
01:39:28,285 --> 01:39:32,033
It appears that the chancellor
is behind everything, including the war.

917
01:39:33,874 --> 01:39:36,579
Palpatine is the Sith lord
we've been looking for.

918
01:39:36,710 --> 01:39:40,790
After the death of Count Dooku,
Anakin became his new apprentice.

919
01:39:47,012 --> 01:39:48,969
I don't believe you.

920
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:51,849
I can't.

921
01:40:00,066 --> 01:40:02,308
I must find him.

922
01:40:04,445 --> 01:40:06,771
You're going to kill him,
aren't you?

923
01:40:10,493 --> 01:40:12,949
He has become
a very great threat.

924
01:40:15,581 --> 01:40:17,040
I can't.

925
01:40:30,764 --> 01:40:32,673
Anakin is the father, isn't he?

926
01:40:37,103 --> 01:40:39,061
I'm so sorry.

927
01:41:25,192 --> 01:41:27,319
- Milady, let me come with you.
- There's no danger.

928
01:41:27,444 --> 01:41:29,401
The fighting's over.
And this is personal.

929
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,902
As you wish, milady,
but I strongly disagree.

930
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:35,650
I'll be all right, Captain.
This is something I must do myself.

931
01:41:35,786 --> 01:41:38,158
Besides, 3PO will look after me.

932
01:41:40,415 --> 01:41:41,874
Oh, dear.

933
01:41:53,845 --> 01:41:57,463
Do you know? I think I'm beginning to
get the hang of this flying business.

934
01:42:25,835 --> 01:42:29,251
<i>The separatists have been
taken care of, my master.</i>

935
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:32,251
It is finished then.

936
01:42:33,676 --> 01:42:39,465
You have restored peace
and justice to the galaxy.

937
01:42:40,266 --> 01:42:44,478
<i>Send a message to the ships
of the Trade Federation.</i>

938
01:42:45,313 --> 01:42:49,774
<i>All droid units
must shut down immediately.</i>

939
01:42:50,652 --> 01:42:52,609
Very good, my lord.

940
01:43:51,878 --> 01:43:53,954
I saw your ship.

941
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:59,801
- What are you doing out here?
- I was so worried about you.

942
01:44:01,263 --> 01:44:04,098
Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

943
01:44:04,224 --> 01:44:05,766
What things?

944
01:44:06,476 --> 01:44:09,394
He said you've turned
to the dark side.

945
01:44:09,521 --> 01:44:14,147
That you... killed younglings.

946
01:44:15,693 --> 01:44:18,363
Obi-Wan is trying
to turn you against me.

947
01:44:18,488 --> 01:44:20,362
He cares about us.

948
01:44:21,074 --> 01:44:22,236
Us?

949
01:44:22,367 --> 01:44:23,825
He knows.

950
01:44:25,203 --> 01:44:27,076
He wants to help you.

951
01:44:30,917 --> 01:44:34,167
Anakin, all I want is your love.

952
01:44:34,295 --> 01:44:36,620
Love won't save you, Padmé.

953
01:44:36,756 --> 01:44:39,959
- Only my new powers can do that.
- At what cost?

954
01:44:40,092 --> 01:44:42,464
You're a good person.
Don't do this.

955
01:44:42,595 --> 01:44:45,300
I won't lose you
the way I lost my mother.

956
01:44:45,431 --> 01:44:49,642
I am becoming more powerful
than any Jedi has ever dreamed of.

957
01:44:49,768 --> 01:44:52,556
And I'm doing it for you.
To protect you.

958
01:44:53,898 --> 01:44:55,855
Come away with me.

959
01:44:56,609 --> 01:44:58,601
Help me raise our child.

960
01:44:58,736 --> 01:45:01,524
Leave everything else behind
while we still can.

961
01:45:01,656 --> 01:45:05,570
Don't you see?
We don't have to run away any more.

962
01:45:06,411 --> 01:45:08,902
I have brought peace
to the Republic.

963
01:45:09,956 --> 01:45:11,865
I am more powerful
than the chancellor.

964
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,076
I can overthrow him.

965
01:45:16,170 --> 01:45:19,207
And together,
you and I can rule the galaxy...

966
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:21,748
make things the way
we want them to be.

967
01:45:28,099 --> 01:45:30,091
I don't believe what I'm hearing.

968
01:45:31,602 --> 01:45:34,888
Obi-Wan was right.
You've changed.

969
01:45:37,108 --> 01:45:39,943
I don't want to hear
any more about Obi-Wan.

970
01:45:40,819 --> 01:45:44,235
The Jedi turned against me.
Don't you turn against me.

971
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:47,942
I don't know you any more.

972
01:45:51,663 --> 01:45:53,621
You're breaking my heart.

973
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:57,287
You're going down a path
I can't follow.

974
01:45:58,295 --> 01:46:00,169
Because of Obi-Wan?

975
01:46:00,964 --> 01:46:03,040
Because of what you've done.

976
01:46:03,175 --> 01:46:05,084
What you plan to do.

977
01:46:06,344 --> 01:46:08,966
Stop. Stop now. Come back.

978
01:46:09,097 --> 01:46:12,015
- I love you.
- Liar!

979
01:46:16,855 --> 01:46:20,603
You're with him!
You brought him here to kill me.

980
01:46:22,068 --> 01:46:23,646
Let her go, Anakin.

981
01:46:26,865 --> 01:46:29,023
Let her go.

982
01:46:39,043 --> 01:46:41,036
You turned her against me!

983
01:46:42,672 --> 01:46:44,830
You have done that yourself.

984
01:46:49,595 --> 01:46:51,754
You will not take her from me!

985
01:46:51,889 --> 01:46:55,721
Your anger and your lust for power
have already done that.

986
01:46:59,688 --> 01:47:04,018
You have allowed this dark lord
to twist your mind...

987
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:08,778
until now you have become
the very thing you swore to destroy.

988
01:47:08,906 --> 01:47:10,779
Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan.

989
01:47:10,908 --> 01:47:13,399
I see through
the lies of the Jedi.

990
01:47:14,536 --> 01:47:16,908
I do not fear
the dark side as you do.

991
01:47:18,749 --> 01:47:20,659
I have brought peace...

992
01:47:20,793 --> 01:47:25,539
freedom, justice and security
to my new empire.

993
01:47:26,549 --> 01:47:28,672
Your new empire?

994
01:47:29,510 --> 01:47:31,550
Don't make me kill you.

995
01:47:32,930 --> 01:47:37,426
Anakin, my allegiance is to
the Republic, to democracy!

996
01:47:38,311 --> 01:47:40,268
If you're not with me...

997
01:47:41,188 --> 01:47:43,062
then you're my enemy.

998
01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:47,564
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.

999
01:47:50,114 --> 01:47:51,987
I will do what I must.

1000
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,072
You will try.

1001
01:48:26,858 --> 01:48:30,856
I hear a new apprentice
you have, Emperor.

1002
01:48:30,987 --> 01:48:35,448
Or should I call you
Darth Sidious?

1003
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:38,148
Master Yoda.

1004
01:48:38,286 --> 01:48:39,946
You survived.

1005
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:42,205
Surprised?

1006
01:48:42,915 --> 01:48:47,494
Your arrogance blinds you,
Master Yoda.

1007
01:48:47,628 --> 01:48:49,668
Now you will experience...

1008
01:48:49,797 --> 01:48:54,258
the full power of the dark side.

1009
01:49:36,218 --> 01:49:41,889
I have waited a long time
for this moment...

1010
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:47,176
my little green friend.

1011
01:49:57,406 --> 01:50:00,857
At last the Jedi are no more.

1012
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:05,204
Not if anything
to say about it I have.

1013
01:50:10,544 --> 01:50:12,869
At an end your rule is.

1014
01:50:14,756 --> 01:50:17,212
And not short enough it was.

1015
01:50:21,972 --> 01:50:24,178
If so powerful you are...

1016
01:50:25,434 --> 01:50:26,892
why leave?

1017
01:50:27,853 --> 01:50:30,390
You will not stop me.

1018
01:50:30,522 --> 01:50:35,100
Darth Vader will become
more powerful than either of us.

1019
01:50:35,235 --> 01:50:39,564
Faith in your new apprentice
misplaced may be.

1020
01:50:40,907 --> 01:50:44,952
As is your faith
in the dark side of the Force.

1021
01:55:12,592 --> 01:55:15,297
Hurry. Careful timing we will need.

1022
01:55:15,428 --> 01:55:18,215
Activate your homing beacon
when you're ready.

1023
01:55:18,347 --> 01:55:20,673
There's no sign of his body, sir.

1024
01:55:20,808 --> 01:55:24,426
- Then he is not dead.
- Double your search.

1025
01:55:24,562 --> 01:55:26,804
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1026
01:55:27,898 --> 01:55:31,978
Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle
for immediate take-off.

1027
01:55:32,111 --> 01:55:37,188
- Yes, Master.
- I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

1028
01:56:46,018 --> 01:56:49,184
Into exile I must go.

1029
01:56:49,896 --> 01:56:51,972
Failed I have.

1030
01:58:31,412 --> 01:58:33,322
I have failed you, Anakin.

1031
01:58:33,456 --> 01:58:35,330
I have failed you.

1032
01:58:35,458 --> 01:58:38,329
I should have known the Jedi
were plotting to take over.

1033
01:58:38,461 --> 01:58:41,248
Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

1034
01:58:41,381 --> 01:58:44,002
From my point of view,
the Jedi are evil.

1035
01:58:44,133 --> 01:58:45,711
Then you are lost!

1036
01:58:57,606 --> 01:59:00,097
This is the end for you, my master.

1037
01:59:24,632 --> 01:59:27,752
It's over, Anakin.
I have the high ground.

1038
01:59:30,430 --> 01:59:33,099
You underestimate my power.

1039
01:59:33,891 --> 01:59:35,599
Don't try it.

1040
01:59:58,499 --> 02:00:00,456
You were the chosen one!

1041
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:05,127
It was said that you would destroy
the Sith, not join them!

1042
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:11,583
Bring balance to the Force,
not leave it in darkness!

1043
02:00:23,273 --> 02:00:25,598
I hate you!

1044
02:00:33,033 --> 02:00:35,321
You were my brother, Anakin.

1045
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:39,695
I loved you.

1046
02:01:20,747 --> 02:01:23,664
Master Kenobi.
We have Miss Padmé on board.

1047
02:01:23,792 --> 02:01:25,868
Yes. Please, please hurry.

1048
02:01:26,002 --> 02:01:28,837
We should leave this dreadful place.

1049
02:01:44,395 --> 02:01:46,352
Is Anakin all right?

1050
02:02:55,173 --> 02:02:57,130
Your Majesty, this way.

1051
02:02:58,092 --> 02:02:59,966
There he is.

1052
02:03:00,094 --> 02:03:02,253
He's still alive.

1053
02:03:05,266 --> 02:03:07,472
Get a medical capsule immediately.

1054
02:03:07,602 --> 02:03:09,559
Yes, sir. Right away.

1055
02:03:45,556 --> 02:03:47,466
Excuse me, Master Yoda.

1056
02:03:53,397 --> 02:03:55,556
Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

1057
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:14,824
We'll take her to
the medical center. Quickly.

1058
02:04:45,156 --> 02:04:47,363
Medically, she's completely healthy.

1059
02:04:47,492 --> 02:04:50,695
For reasons we can't explain,
we are losing her.

1060
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:54,785
- She's dying?
- We don't know why.

1061
02:04:54,916 --> 02:04:56,956
She has lost the will to live.

1062
02:04:57,085 --> 02:05:00,205
We need to operate quickly
if we are to save the babies.

1063
02:05:00,338 --> 02:05:01,916
Babies?

1064
02:05:02,048 --> 02:05:03,922
She's carrying twins.

1065
02:05:46,091 --> 02:05:47,551
Luke.

1066
02:05:55,768 --> 02:05:57,227
Oh, Luke.

1067
02:06:19,708 --> 02:06:22,034
- It's a girl.
- Leia.

1068
02:07:11,509 --> 02:07:13,383
There's good in him.

1069
02:07:16,097 --> 02:07:17,472
I know.

1070
02:07:18,182 --> 02:07:21,765
I know there's... still-

1071
02:07:57,012 --> 02:07:58,471
Lord Vader.

1072
02:07:59,806 --> 02:08:01,929
Can you hear me?

1073
02:08:04,978 --> 02:08:06,438
Yes, Master.

1074
02:08:09,567 --> 02:08:11,441
Where is Padmé?

1075
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:15,153
Is she safe?

1076
02:08:16,282 --> 02:08:18,275
Is she all right?

1077
02:08:19,994 --> 02:08:24,537
It seems, in your anger,
you killed her.

1078
02:08:25,583 --> 02:08:28,453
I ? I couldn't have.

1079
02:08:28,586 --> 02:08:31,586
She was alive. I felt it!

1080
02:09:05,538 --> 02:09:09,157
Hidden, safe the children must be kept.

1081
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:14,495
We must take them somewhere where
the Sith will not sense their presence.

1082
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:19,173
Split up they should be.

1083
02:09:19,886 --> 02:09:21,795
My wife and I will take the girl.

1084
02:09:23,389 --> 02:09:26,260
We've always talked
of adopting a baby girl.

1085
02:09:26,392 --> 02:09:28,634
She will be loved with us.

1086
02:09:29,562 --> 02:09:31,519
And what of the boy?

1087
02:09:32,482 --> 02:09:35,981
To Tatooine.
To his family send him.

1088
02:09:37,820 --> 02:09:40,228
I will take the child
and watch over him.

1089
02:09:45,703 --> 02:09:49,368
Until the time is right,
disappear we will.

1090
02:09:51,208 --> 02:09:54,791
Master Kenobi, wait a moment.

1091
02:09:56,338 --> 02:10:01,545
In your solitude on Tatooine,
training I have for you.

1092
02:10:02,886 --> 02:10:04,167
Training?

1093
02:10:04,304 --> 02:10:08,883
An old friend has learned
the path to immortality.

1094
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:14,020
One who has returned from
the netherworld of the Force.

1095
02:10:14,147 --> 02:10:16,555
Your old master.

1096
02:10:17,275 --> 02:10:18,734
Qui-Gon?

1097
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:24,530
How to commune with him
I will teach you.

1098
02:10:26,035 --> 02:10:28,158
- Captain Antilles.
- Yes, Your Highness?

1099
02:10:28,287 --> 02:10:30,161
I'm placing these droids
in your care.

1100
02:10:30,289 --> 02:10:32,163
Treat them well. Clean them up.

1101
02:10:32,291 --> 02:10:34,165
Have the protocol droid's
mind wiped.

1102
02:10:34,293 --> 02:10:35,752
What?

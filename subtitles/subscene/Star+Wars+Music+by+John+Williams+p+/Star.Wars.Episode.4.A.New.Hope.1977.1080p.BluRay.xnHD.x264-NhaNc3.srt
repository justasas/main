1
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Did you hear that?

2
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,000
They shut down the main reactor.
We'll be destroyed for sure.

3
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,670
This is madness.

4
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,140
We're doomed.

5
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,770
There'll be no escape
for the princess this time.

6
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,570
What's that?

7
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,380
R2-D2, where are you?

8
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,400
At last. Where have you been?

9
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,610
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do?

10
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,990
We'll be sent to the Kessel spice mines
or smashed into who knows what.

11
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

12
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,010
The Death Star plans
are not in the main computer.

13
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,720
Where are those transmissions
you intercepted?

14
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,640
What have you done with those plans?

15
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
We intercepted no transmissions.

16
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,690
This is a consular ship.
We're on a diplomatic mission.

17
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,400
If this is a consular ship,
where is the ambassador?

18
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,360
Commander, tear this ship apart
until you've found those plans!

19
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:12,410
And bring me the passengers!
I want them alive!

20
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,420
There's one. Set for stun.

21
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,810
She'll be all right.

22
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,810
Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

23
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,890
Hey. You're not permitted in there.
It's restricted.

24
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,940
You'll be deactivated for sure.

25
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,530
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease.

26
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,280
Come out, before somebody sees you.

27
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,870
Secret mission? What plans?

28
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,580
What are you talking about?
I'm not getting in there.

29
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,170
I'm going to regret this.

30
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,630
- There goes another one.
- Hold your fire. There's no life-forms.

31
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,050
It must have short-circuited.

32
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,470
That's funny. The damage
doesn't look as bad from out here.

33
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,810
Are you sure this thing is safe?

34
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,250
Darth Vader. Only you could be so bold.

35
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,960
The Imperial Senate will not sit still for this.
When they hear you've attacked a diplomatic--

36
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,130
Don't act so surprised, Your Highness.

37
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,130
You weren't on
any mercy mission this time.

38
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,340
Several transmissions
were beamed to this ship by rebel spies.

39
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,310
I want to know what happened
to the plans they sent you.

40
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,430
I don't know what you're talking about.

41
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm a member of the Imperial Senate
on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan.

42
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,480
You are part of the Rebel Alliance
and a traitor.

43
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
Take her away!

44
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,360
Holding her is dangerous.

45
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,990
If word of this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.

46
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,450
I have traced the rebel spies to her.

47
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,250
Now she is my only link
to finding their secret base.

48
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,250
She'll die before
she'll tell you anything.

49
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,000
Leave that to me.

50
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,590
Send a distress signal, and then inform
the senate that all aboard were killed.

51
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,800
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship...

52
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,340
and no transmissions were made.

53
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,640
An escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting,
but no life-forms were aboard.

54
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,730
She must have hidden
the plans in the escape pod.

55
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,400
Send a detachment down to retrieve them.
See to it personally, Commander.

56
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

57
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,230
Yes, sir.

58
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,830
How did we get into this mess?

59
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,290
I really don't know how.

60
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,260
We seem to be made to suffer.
It's our lot in life.

61
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,470
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

62
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,560
What a desolate place this is.

63
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,740
Where do you think you're going?

64
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,320
Well, I'm not going that way.

65
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,610
It's much too rocky.

66
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,120
This way is much easier.

67
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,620
What makes you think
there are settlements over there?

68
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,120
Don't get technical with me.

69
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,460
What mission? What are you talking about?

70
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,880
I've just about had enough of you.

71
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,920
Go that way.

72
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,840
You'll be malfunctioning within a day,
you nearsighted scrap pile.

73
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,600
And don't let me catch you
following me, begging for help...

74
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,180
because you won't get it.

75
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,360
No more adventures.

76
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,450
I'm not going that way.

77
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault.

78
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,570
He tricked me into going this way...

79
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,580
but he'll do no better.

80
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,960
Wait. What's that?

81
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,790
A transport. I'm saved.

82
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,630
Over here!

83
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,340
Hey! Hey!

84
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,880
Help! Please help!

85
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,390
R2?

86
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,190
R2-D2, it is you! It is you!

87
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,970
Someone was in the pod.
The tracks go off in this direction.

88
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,930
Look, sir. Droids.

89
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,910
We stopped.

90
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,790
Wake up. Wake up!

91
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,340
We're doomed.

92
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,640
Do you think they'll melt us down?

93
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,610
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

94
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,200
Will this never end?

95
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,030
- Fine. Let's go.
- Luke!

96
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,610
Luke!

97
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,120
Luke, tell your uncle if he gets a translator,
be sure it speaks Bocce.

98
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,750
Doesn't look like we have much choice,
but I'll remind him.

99
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,060
Yeah, we'll take that red one.

100
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,100
No, not that one.

101
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,850
You. I suppose you're programmed
for etiquette and protocol.

102
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Protocol? It's my primary function, sir.
I am well-versed in all the customs--

103
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,360
- I have no need for a protocol droid.
- Of course you haven't, sir.

104
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,200
Not in an environment such as this.
That's why I have been programmed--

105
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,330
I need a droid who understands
the binary language of moisture vaporators.

106
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,710
Vaporators? Sir, my first job
was programming binary load lifters...

107
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,960
very similar to your vaporators
in most respects.

108
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,590
- Can you speak Bocce?
- Of course. It's like a second language.

109
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,880
- All right. Shut up. I'll take this one.
- Shutting up, sir.

110
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,170
Luke!

111
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,300
Take these two to the garage.
I want them cleaned up before dinner.

112
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,310
But I was going into Tosche Station
to pick up some power converters.

113
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,640
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done.

114
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,310
Now come on. Get to it.

115
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,610
All right. Come on.

116
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,980
And the red one. Come on.

117
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,200
Come on, red. Let's go.

118
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,010
- Uncle Owen.
- Yeah?

119
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,850
This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look.

120
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,350
Hey, what are you trying to push on us?

121
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,310
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit
is in prime condition, a real bargain.

122
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,320
Uncle Owen, what about that one?

123
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,940
What about that blue one?
We'll take that one.

124
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,490
Take this away.

125
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,160
You'll be pleased with that one, sir.

126
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,160
He really is in first-class condition.
I've worked with him before.

127
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
Here he comes.

128
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,880
Okay. Let's go.

129
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,710
Don't you forget this.

130
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,300
Why I should stick my neck out for you
is quite beyond my capacity.

131
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,720
Thank the maker.
This oil bath is going to feel so good.

132
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,810
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination,
I can barely move.

133
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,520
It just isn't fair.

134
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,360
Biggs is right.
I'm never gonna get out of here.

135
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,990
Is there anything I might do to help?

136
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,280
No, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest...

137
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,030
or teleport me off this rock.

138
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,700
I don't think so, sir.

139
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,830
I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things.

140
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,830
Not on this planet, anyway.

141
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,330
As a matter of fact,
I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

142
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,540
Well, if there's a bright center
to the universe...

143
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,880
you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

144
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,920
I see, sir.

145
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,010
- You can call me Luke.
- I see, Sir Luke.

146
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,890
Just Luke.

147
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,730
And I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.

148
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,480
And this is my counterpart, R2-D2.

149
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,600
Hello.

150
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:39,730
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
Looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

151
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,030
With all we've been through...

152
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,360
sometimes I'm amazed
we're in as good condition as we are...

153
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,120
what with the rebellion and all.

154
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,160
You know of the rebellion
against the Empire?

155
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,080
That's how we came to be in your service,
if you take my meaning, sir.

156
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,080
- Have you been in many battles?
- Several, I think.

157
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,080
There's not much to tell.

158
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm not much more than an interpreter
and not very good at telling stories.

159
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,380
Well, not at making them
interesting, anyway.

160
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,010
Well, my little friend...

161
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,180
you got something jammed
in here real good.

162
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,760
Were you on a Starcruiser or--

163
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,680
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

164
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,390
What's this?

165
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,600
"What is what"?
He asked you a question. What is that?

166
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:27,990
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

167
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,500
He says it's nothing, sir,
merely a malfunction.

168
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,910
Old data. Pay it no mind.

169
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,080
Who is she? She's beautiful.

170
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,550
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

171
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,800
I think she was a passenger
on our last voyage.

172
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
A person of some importance, I believe.

173
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,390
- Our captain was--
- Is there any more to this recording?

174
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,720
Behave yourself, R2.
You're going to get us into trouble.

175
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:55,600
It's all right. You can trust him.
He's our new master.

176
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,350
You're my only hope.

177
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,360
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi,
a resident of these parts...

178
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,240
and it's a private message for him.

179
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,360
Frankly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

180
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,450
Our last master was Captain Antilles.

181
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:14,200
But with all we've been through,
this R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.

182
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,460
Obi-Wan Kenobi.
I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi.

183
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,210
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know
what he's talking about?

184
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,750
I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan...

185
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,720
but old Ben lives out beyond the Dune Sea.

186
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,590
He's kind of a strange old hermit.

187
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,720
I wonder who she is.

188
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,720
Sounds like she's in trouble.
I better play back the whole thing.

189
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,770
He says the restraining bolt has
short-circuited his recording system.

190
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,690
He suggests that if you remove the bolt...

191
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,530
he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

192
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,740
Oh, yeah. Well...

193
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,330
I guess you're too small
to run away on me if I take this off.

194
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,620
Okay.

195
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,120
There you go.

196
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,000
Where'd she go? Bring her back.
Play back the entire message.

197
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,090
"What message"?

198
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,510
The one you've just been playing.

199
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:08,760
The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards.

200
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,180
Luke! Luke!

201
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,510
I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

202
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have
picked up a slight flutter.

203
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,270
Here. See what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

204
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,780
Just you reconsider
playing that message for him.

205
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,740
No, I don't think he likes you at all.

206
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,780
No, I don't like you either.

207
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,340
- I think that R2 unit might have been stolen.
- What makes you think that?

208
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,380
I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him.

209
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,970
He says he belongs to someone
called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

210
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,850
I thought he might have meant old Ben.
Do you know what he's talking about?

211
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,140
I wonder if he's related to Ben.

212
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,020
That wizard's just a crazy old man.

213
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,030
Tomorrow, take that R2 unit to Anchorhead
and have its memory erased.

214
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,190
That'll be the end of it.
It belongs to us now.

215
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,570
But what if this Obi-Wan
comes looking for him?

216
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,780
He won't.

217
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,750
I don't think he exists anymore.
He died about the same time as your father.

218
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,960
- He knew my father?
- I told you to forget it.

219
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,090
Your only concern is to prepare
those new droids for tomorrow.

220
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,130
In the morning, I want them on the south ridge,
working on those condensers.

221
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,300
Yes, sir.

222
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,140
I think those new droids
are gonna work out fine.

223
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,600
In fact, I was also thinking
about our agreement--

224
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,480
about me staying on another season.

225
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,190
If these new droids work out,
I want to apply to the academy this year.

226
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,030
You mean the next semester
before the harvest?

227
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,950
Sure. There's more than enough droids.

228
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,070
Harvest is when I need you the most.

229
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,200
It's only one season more.

230
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,450
This year we'll make enough
on the harvest to hire more hands...

231
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,830
and then you can go
to the academy next year.

232
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,790
You must understand I need you here, Luke.

233
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,800
- But it's a whole 'nother year.
- It's only one more season.

234
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,960
That's what you said
when Biggs and Tank left.

235
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,550
- Where are you going?
- Looks like I'm going nowhere.

236
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,430
I have to go finish cleaning those droids.

237
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,890
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone.

238
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,020
It means so much to him.

239
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,100
I'll make it up to him next year.
I promise.

240
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,730
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen.
He has too much of his father in him.

241
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,030
That's what I'm afraid of.

242
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,370
- What are you doing hiding back there?
- It wasn't my fault, sir.

243
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,250
Please don't deactivate me.

244
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,000
I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning.

245
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,300
- Kept babbling on about his mission.
- Oh, no.

246
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,180
That R2 unit has always been a problem.

247
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,890
These astro droids
are getting quite out of hand.

248
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,230
Even I can't understand
their logic at times.

249
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,020
How could I be so stupid?
He's nowhere in sight.

250
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,070
Blast it!

251
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,780
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

252
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,070
It's too dangerous with the Sand People around.
We'll have to wait till morning.

253
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,160
Luke, I'm shutting the power down.

254
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,200
I'll be there in a few minutes.

255
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,370
Boy, am I gonna get it.

256
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,460
That little droid's gonna cause me
a lot of trouble.

257
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,500
He excels at that, sir.

258
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,130
Come on.

259
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,110
Have you seen Luke this morning?

260
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,610
He said he had things to do before
he started today, so he left early.

261
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,780
- Did he take those new droids with him?
- I think so.

262
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,280
He better have those units in
the south range repaired by midday...

263
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,040
or there'll be hell to pay.

264
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,620
There's a droid on the scanner.
Dead ahead.

265
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,710
It might be our little R2 unit.
Hit the accelerator.

266
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,190
Where do you think you're going?

267
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,030
Master Luke is your rightful owner now.

268
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,110
We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi gibberish.

269
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,950
Don't talk to me of your mission either.

270
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,160
You're fortunate he doesn't blast you
into a million pieces right here.

271
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,290
No. It's all right,
but I think we'd better go.

272
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,920
What's wrong with him now?

273
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,090
There are several creatures
approaching from the southeast.

274
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,760
Sand People. Or worse.

275
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,340
Come on. Let's go have a look.

276
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,430
Come on.

277
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,890
Well, there are two Banthas down there,
but I don't see any--

278
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,770
Wait a second.

279
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:55,730
They're Sand People, all right.
I can see one of them now.

280
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,560
Hello there.

281
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,230
Come here, my little friend.
Don't be afraid.

282
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,690
Don't worry. He'll be all right.

283
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,410
Rest easy, son. You've had a busy day.

284
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,200
You're fortunate to be all in one piece.

285
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,670
Ben? Ben Kenobi?

286
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,750
Boy, am I glad to see you.

287
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,880
The Jundland Wastes
are not to be traveled lightly.

288
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,600
Tell me, young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

289
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,930
This little droid.

290
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,560
I think he's searching for his former master...

291
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,770
but I've never seen
such devotion in a droid before.

292
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,940
He claims to be the property
of an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

293
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,650
Is he a relative of yours?
Do you know who he's talking about?

294
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,870
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

295
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,740
Obi-Wan.

296
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,670
Now, that's a name
I've not heard in a long time.

297
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,250
A long time.

298
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,340
I think my uncle knows him.
He said he was dead.

299
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,130
He's not dead.

300
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,430
Not yet.

301
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,510
- You know him?
- Of course I know him.

302
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,970
He's me.

303
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,940
I haven't gone by the name of Obi-Wan...

304
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,690
since, oh, before you were born.

305
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,400
Then the droid does belong to you.

306
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,150
I don't seem to remember
ever owning a droid.

307
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,490
Very interesting.

308
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,450
I think we better get indoors.

309
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,830
The Sand People are easily startled...

310
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,750
but they'll soon be back--
and in greater numbers.

311
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,960
3PO.

312
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,020
Where am I? I must have taken a bad step.

313
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,730
Can you stand? We've gotta get out
of here before the Sand People return.

314
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,560
I don't think I can make it.
You go on, Master Luke.

315
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,690
There's no sense in you risking yourself
on my account. I'm done for.

316
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,660
No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

317
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,660
Quickly. They're on the move.

318
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,330
My father didn't fight in the wars.
He was a navigator on a spice freighter.

319
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,170
That's what your uncle told you.
He didn't hold with your father's ideals.

320
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,380
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

321
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,430
- You fought in the Clone Wars?
- Yes.

322
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:56,180
I was once a Jedi knight,
the same as your father.

323
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,480
I wish I'd known him.

324
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,310
He was the best starpilot in the galaxy...

325
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,110
and a cunning warrior.

326
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,730
I understand you've become
quite a good pilot yourself.

327
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,740
And he was a good friend.

328
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,910
Which reminds me...

329
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
I have something here for you.

330
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,750
Your father wanted you to have this
when you were old enough...

331
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,540
but your uncle wouldn't allow it.

332
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,500
He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan...

333
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:32,050
on some damn-fool idealistic crusade,
like your father did.

334
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,090
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for a while.

335
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,760
Sure. Go ahead.

336
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:42,850
- What is it?
- Your father's lightsaber.

337
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,230
This is the weapon of a Jedi knight.

338
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,150
Not as clumsy or random as a blaster.

339
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,400
An elegant weapon...

340
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:55,490
for a more civilized age.

341
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,740
For over a thousand generations,
the Jedi knights...

342
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,790
were the guardians of
peace and justice in the old Republic...

343
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,620
before the dark times...

344
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,420
before the Empire.

345
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,380
How did my father die?

346
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,390
A young Jedi named Darth Vader...

347
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,060
who was a pupil of mine
until he turned to evil...

348
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,140
helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi knights.

349
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,400
He betrayed and murdered your father.

350
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,440
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.

351
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,410
Vader was seduced
by the dark side of the Force.

352
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,080
The Force?

353
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,830
The Force is what gives a Jedi his power.

354
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,040
It's an energy field
created by all living things.

355
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,710
It surrounds us and penetrates us.

356
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,840
It binds the galaxy together.

357
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,470
Let's see if we can't figure out
what you are, my little friend...

358
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,810
and where you come from.

359
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,060
- I saw part of a message--
- I seem to have found it.

360
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,480
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars.

361
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,030
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

362
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,240
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request in person.

363
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,200
But my ship has fallen under attack...

364
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,580
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

365
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:26,960
I have placed information
vital to the survival of the rebellion...

366
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,120
into the memory systems of this R2 unit.

367
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,040
My father will know how to retrieve it.

368
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:35,010
You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan.

369
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,340
This is our most desperate hour.

370
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,470
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

371
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,490
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

372
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,030
Alderaan?

373
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,990
I'm not going to Alderaan.

374
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,450
I've gotta get home.
It's late. I'm in for it as it is.

375
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,960
I need your help, Luke.
She needs your help.

376
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,210
I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

377
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,180
I can't get involved. I've got work to do.

378
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,800
It's not that I like the Empire.
I hate it.

379
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,470
But there's nothing
I can do about it right now.

380
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,480
- It's all such a long way from here.
- That's your uncle talking.

381
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,440
Oh, boy. My uncle.
How am I ever gonna explain this?

382
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,230
Learn about the Force, Luke.

383
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,620
I can take you as far as Anchorhead.

384
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,700
You can get a transport there
to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

385
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,920
You must do what you feel
is right, of course.

386
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,100
Until this battle station is fully operational,
we are vulnerable.

387
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,350
The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.

388
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,350
They're more dangerous than you realize.

389
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,350
Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander...

390
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,150
not to this battle station.

391
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,860
The rebellion will continue to
gain support in the Imperial Senate--

392
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,650
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us.

393
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,530
I've just received word that the emperor
has dissolved the council permanently.

394
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,290
The last remnants of the old Republic
have been swept away.

395
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,370
That's impossible.

396
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,750
How will the emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

397
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,380
The regional governors now have
direct control over their territories.

398
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,760
Fear will keep the local systems in line.

399
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,970
Fear of this battle station.

400
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,220
And what of the rebellion?

401
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,560
If the rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station...

402
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,600
it is possible, however unlikely...

403
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,810
that they might find a weakness
and exploit it.

404
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,150
The plans you refer to
will soon be back in our hands.

405
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,530
Any attack by the rebels against this
station would be a useless gesture...

406
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:05,610
no matter what technical data
they've obtained.

407
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,330
This station is now
the ultimate power in the universe.

408
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,750
I suggest we use it.

409
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:16,080
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've constructed.

410
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,590
The ability to destroy a planet
is insignificant...

411
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,500
next to the power of the Force.

412
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:25,050
Don't try to frighten us with
your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.

413
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,800
Your sad devotion
to that ancient religion...

414
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,680
has not helped you conjure up
the stolen data tapes...

415
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,850
or given you clairvoyance enough
to find the rebels' hidden fortress--

416
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,690
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

417
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,530
Enough of this. Vader, release him.

418
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,080
As you wish.

419
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:54,370
This bickering is pointless.

420
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,250
Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the rebel fortress...

421
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,420
by the time this station is operational.

422
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,260
We will then crush the rebellion
with one swift stroke.

423
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,810
It looks like the Sand People did this.
There's gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks.

424
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:19,230
I've just never heard of them
hitting anything this big before.

425
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:22,650
They didn't, but we are
meant to think they did.

426
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,650
These tracks are side-by-side.

427
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,910
Sand People always ride single file
to hide their numbers.

428
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,870
These are the same Jawas
that sold us R2 and 3PO.

429
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,160
And these blast points,
too accurate for Sand People.

430
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,750
Only imperial stormtroopers
are so precise.

431
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,380
But why would imperial troops
want to slaughter Jawas?

432
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,800
If they traced the robots here,
they may have learned who they sold them to...

433
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,890
and that would lead them back... home.

434
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,270
Wait, Luke.

435
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,350
It's too dangerous.

436
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,340
Uncle Owen.

437
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,420
Aunt Beru.

438
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,670
Uncle Owen.

439
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:22,560
Now, Your Highness, we will discuss
the location of your hidden rebel base.

440
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,900
There's nothing you could have done,
had you been there.

441
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,650
You'd have been killed too...

442
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,450
and the droids would now be
in the hands of the Empire.

443
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I want to come with you to Alderaan.

444
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,990
There's nothing for me here now.

445
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,080
I want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

446
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,140
Mos Eisley spaceport.

447
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,020
You will never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

448
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,480
We must be cautious.

449
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,730
How long have you had these droids?

450
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,990
- Three or four seasons.
- They're up for sale if you want them.

451
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,990
Let me see your identification.

452
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,370
You don't need to see his identification.

453
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,830
We don't need to see his identification.

454
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,450
These aren't the droids
you're looking for.

455
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,500
These aren't the droids we're looking for.

456
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,040
He can go about his business.

457
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,380
- You can go about your business.
- Move along.

458
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,050
Move along. Move along.

459
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,530
I can't abide those Jawas.
Disgusting creatures.

460
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,030
Go on, go on.

461
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:24,080
I can't understand how we got by those troops.
I thought we were dead.

462
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,500
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded.

463
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,840
You really think we're gonna find
a pilot here to take us to Alderaan?

464
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,880
Most of the best freighter pilots
are to be found here.

465
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,800
Only watch your step--
this place can be a little rough.

466
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,640
I'm ready for anything.

467
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,890
Come along, R2.

468
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,950
- Hey. We don't serve their kind here.
- What?

469
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:45,990
Your droids-- they'll have to wait outside.
We don't want them here.

470
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:48,540
Wait out by the speeder.
We don't want any trouble.

471
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,620
I heartily agree with you, sir.

472
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,760
I'll have one of those.

473
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,670
- He doesn't like you.
- I'm sorry.

474
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,220
I don't like you either.
You just watch yourself.

475
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,890
We're wanted men.
I have the death sentence on 12 systems.

476
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,810
- I'll be careful then.
- You'll be dead!

477
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,850
This little one's not worth the effort.

478
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,190
Come, let me get you something.

479
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,340
I'm all right.

480
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,220
Chewbacca here is first mate
on a ship that might suit us.

481
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,190
I don't like the look of this.

482
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,580
Han Solo. I'm captain
of the Millennium Falcon.

483
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,880
Chewie here tells me you're looking
for passage to the Alderaan system.

484
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,290
Yes, indeed, if it's a fast ship.

485
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,170
Fast ship? You've never heard of
the Millennium Falcon?

486
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:08,880
Should I have?

487
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,140
It's the ship that made the Kessel run
in less than 12 parsecs.

488
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,430
I've outrun imperial starships.

489
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,520
Not the local bulk cruisers, mind you.

490
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:20,770
I'm talking about
the big Corellian ships now.

491
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,610
She's fast enough for you, old man.

492
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,570
- What's the cargo?
- Only passengers--

493
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:31,490
myself, the boy, two droids...

494
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,580
and no questions asked.

495
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,660
Is it some kind of local trouble?

496
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,960
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any imperial entanglements.

497
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,130
Well, that's the real trick, isn't it?

498
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,170
And it's gonna cost you something extra.

499
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:52,760
10,000, all in advance.

500
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,810
10,000?

501
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,640
We could almost buy our own ship for that.

502
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,980
But who's gonna fly it, kid? You?

503
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,150
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot.

504
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,650
We don't have to sit here and listen--

505
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,610
We can pay you 2,000 now...

506
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:12,990
plus 15 when we reach Alderaan.

507
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,950
Seventeen?

508
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,910
Okay, you guys got yourselves a ship.

509
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,500
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking Bay 94.

510
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,790
Ninety-four.

511
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,840
Looks like somebody's beginning
to take an interest in your handiwork.

512
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,510
All right. We'll check it out.

513
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:48,820
17,000. Those guys
must really be desperate.

514
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,360
This could really save my neck.
Get back to the ship, get it ready.

515
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,490
- You'll have to sell your speeder.
- That's okay.

516
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,620
I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

517
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:01,040
Going somewhere, Solo?

518
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,290
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact,
I was just going to see your boss.

519
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,630
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

520
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,630
It's too late.

521
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,130
You should have paid him when you had the chance.

522
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,340
Jabba's put a price on your head so large

523
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,140
every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you...

524
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,810
I'm lucky I found you first.

525
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,100
Yeah, but this time I've got the money.

526
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,770
If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

527
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,020
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba--

528
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,820
Jabba's through with you.

529
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,280
He has no time for smugglers

530
00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:38,700
who drop their shipments at the first
sign of an Imperial cruiser.

531
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,990
Even I get boarded sometimes.
Do you think I had a choice?

532
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:45,210
You can tell that to Jabba.
He may only take your ship.

533
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,420
Over my dead body.

534
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,630
That's the idea.

535
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,710
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

536
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,260
I'll bet you have.

537
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,940
Sorry about the mess.

538
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,370
Her resistance to the mind probe
is considerable.

539
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,870
It'll be some time before we can
extract any information from her.

540
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,540
The final checkout is completed.
All systems are operational.

541
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,880
What course shall we set?

542
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:35,380
Perhaps she would respond
to an alternative form of persuasion.

543
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,090
What do you mean?

544
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:40,140
I think it is time we demonstrated
the full power of this station.

545
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,720
- Set your course for Alderaan.
- With pleasure.

546
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,930
Lock the door, R2.

547
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Check this side of the street.

548
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,820
The door's locked.
Move on to the next one.

549
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,370
I would much rather have gone with Master Luke
than stay here with you.

550
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,580
I don't know what this trouble is about,
but I'm sure it must be your fault.

551
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,920
You watch your language.

552
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,510
All right. Give it to me. I'll take it.

553
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:21,930
Look at this. Ever since the XP-38
came out, they just aren't in demand.

554
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,010
It'll be enough.

555
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,660
Solo, come out of there, Solo!

556
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,790
Right here, Jabba.

557
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,540
I've been waitin' for you.

558
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,840
Have you now.

559
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,840
You didn't think I was gonna run, did you?

560
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:01,930
Han, my boy, you disappoint me.

561
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,680
Why haven't you paid me...

562
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,600
and why did you fry poor Greedo?

563
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,230
Jabba, next time you wanna talk to me,
come see me yourself.

564
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,690
Don't send one of these twerps.

565
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,110
Han, I can't make exceptions.

566
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,110
What if everyone who smuggled for me

567
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,700
dropped their cargo at the first sign

568
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,410
of an Imperial starship?

569
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,830
It's not good business.

570
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,290
Look, Jabba, even I get boarded sometimes.

571
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,000
You think I had a choice?

572
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,880
But I got a nice, easy charter.

573
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,010
I'll pay ya back, plus a little extra.
I just need a little more time.

574
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:44,890
Han, my boy, you're the best.

575
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:48,010
So, for an extra twenty percent...

576
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,270
Fifteen, Jabba. Don't push it.

577
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,230
Okay, fifteen percent.

578
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,230
But, if you fail me again...

579
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,400
I'll put a price on your head so big,

580
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:01,490
you won't be able to go near a civilized system.

581
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,910
Jabba, you're a wonderful human being.

582
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,240
Come on!

583
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:17,170
If the ship's as fast as he's boasting,
we ought to do well.

584
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,780
What a piece of junk.

585
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,410
She'll make .5 past light speed.

586
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:48,280
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts, kid.

587
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,370
I've made a lot of special
modifications myself.

588
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:55,370
But we're a little rushed, so if you'll
just get on board, we'll get outta here.

589
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,460
Hello, sir.

590
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,640
Which way?

591
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,640
All right, men, load your weapons.

592
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,860
Stop that ship. Blast them.

593
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Chewie, get us out of here!

594
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,670
Oh, my. I'd forgotten
how much I hate space travel.

595
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,650
Looks like an imperial cruiser.
Our passengers are hotter than I thought.

596
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,150
Hold 'em off.
Angle the deflector shields...

597
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,360
while I make the calculations
for the jump to light speed.

598
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,000
Stay sharp. There's two more comin' in.
They're gonna try and cut us off.

599
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:18,160
Why don't you outrun 'em?
You said this thing was fast.

600
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,130
Watch your mouth or you're gonna
find yourself floating home.

601
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,630
We'll be safe enough
once we make the jump to hyperspace.

602
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,590
Besides, I know a few maneuvers.
We'll lose 'em.

603
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,720
Here's where the fun begins.

604
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,600
How long before you can
jump to light speed?

605
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,600
It'll take a few moments to get
the coordinates from the navicomputer.

606
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,270
Are you kidding?
At the rate they're gaining?

607
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:41,400
Traveling through hyperspace
ain't like dustin' crops, boy.

608
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,940
Without precise calculations,
we'd fly right through a star...

609
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,650
or bounce too close to a supernova,
and that would end your trip real quick.

610
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,110
- What's that flashing?
- We're losing a deflector shield.

611
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,160
Go strap yourselves in.
I'm gonna make the jump to light speed.

612
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,470
We've entered the Alderaan system.

613
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,440
Governor Tarkin. I should have expected
to find you holding Vader's leash.

614
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,190
I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

615
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,740
Charming to the last.

616
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,320
You don't know how hard I found it...

617
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,320
signing the order to terminate your life.

618
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:36,280
I'm surprised you had the courage
to take the responsibility yourself.

619
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:39,540
Princess Leia, before your execution...

620
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,830
I would like you to be my guest
at a ceremony...

621
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,920
that will make
this battle station operational.

622
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,840
No star system will dare
oppose the emperor now.

623
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,670
The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin...

624
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,430
the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

625
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,260
Not after we demonstrate
the power of this station.

626
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,390
In a way, you have determined
the choice of the planet...

627
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,600
that'll be destroyed first.

628
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:07,230
Since you are reluctant to provide us
with the location of the rebel base...

629
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,110
I have chosen to test
this station's destructive power...

630
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,200
on your home planet of Alderaan.

631
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,950
No. Alderaan is peaceful.
We have no weapons.

632
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,370
You would prefer another target?
A military target?

633
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:20,700
Then name the system.

634
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,960
I grow tired of asking this,
so it will be the last time.

635
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,710
Where is the rebel base?

636
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,880
Dantooine.

637
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,340
They're on Dantooine.

638
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:39,810
There. You see, Lord Vader?
She can be reasonable.

639
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:42,770
Continue with the operation.
You may fire when ready.

640
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,020
- What?
- You're far too trusting.

641
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,560
Dantooine is too remote
to make an effective demonstration.

642
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:52,240
But don't worry. We will deal with
your rebel friends soon enough.

643
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,740
Commence primary ignition.

644
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,270
Are you all right? What's wrong?

645
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,850
I felt a great disturbance in the Force...

646
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:29,150
as if millions of voices suddenly
cried out in terror...

647
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,190
and were suddenly silenced.

648
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,940
I fear something terrible has happened.

649
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,910
You'd better get on with your exercises.

650
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,870
You can forget your troubles
with those imperial slugs.

651
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:44,950
I told you I'd outrun them.

652
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,000
Don't everybody thank me at once.

653
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:54,510
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about 0200 hours.

654
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,060
Now be careful, R2.

655
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,030
He made a fair move.
Screaming about it can't help you.

656
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:19,280
Let him have it.
It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

657
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,740
But, sir, nobody worries
about upsetting a droid.

658
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:26,410
That's 'cause a droid don't pull people's arms
out of their sockets when they lose.

659
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:28,710
Wookiees are known to do that.

660
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,250
I see your point, sir.

661
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,010
I suggest a new strategy, R2.
Let the Wookiee win.

662
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,110
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

663
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,200
- You mean it controls your actions?
- Partially.

664
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,200
But it also obeys your commands.

665
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:12,670
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a blaster at your side, kid.

666
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:15,050
You don't believe in the Force, do you?

667
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,300
Kid, I've flown from one side
of this galaxy to the other.

668
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,300
I've seen a lot of strange stuff...

669
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,640
but I've never seen anything
to make me believe...

670
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,100
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything.

671
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:30,310
There's no mystical energy field
that controls my destiny.

672
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:33,270
It's all a lot of
simple tricks and nonsense.

673
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,230
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

674
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,610
This time, let go your conscious self...

675
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:44,660
and act on instinct.

676
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:49,200
With the blast shield down, I can't see.
How am I supposed to fight?

677
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:51,750
Your eyes can deceive you.
Don't trust them.

678
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,470
Stretch out with your feelings.

679
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,070
You see? You can do it.

680
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,820
I call it luck.

681
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,530
In my experience,
there's no such thing as luck.

682
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:26,870
Good against remotes is one thing.

683
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,950
Good against the living,
that's something else.

684
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,080
We're coming up on Alderaan.

685
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,130
I did feel something.
I could almost see the remote.

686
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:43,630
That's good. You've taken
your first step into a larger world.

687
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:50,390
Yes?

688
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:52,480
Our scout ships have reached Dantooine.

689
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,480
They found the remains of a rebel base...

690
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,940
but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.

691
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,400
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

692
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,990
She lied. She lied to us.

693
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:07,780
I told you she would never
consciously betray the rebellion.

694
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,910
Terminate her immediately.

695
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,960
Stand by, Chewie. Here we go.
Cut in the sublight engines.

696
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:20,800
What the--

697
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,090
We've come out of hyperspace
into a meteor shower...

698
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:27,590
some kind of asteroid collision.

699
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,010
- It's not on any of the charts.
- What's going on?

700
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,430
Our position's correct,
except no Alderaan.

701
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,770
- Where is it?
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

702
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,690
It ain't there. It's been blown away.

703
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:39,480
- What? How?
- Destroyed by the Empire.

704
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,780
The entire starfleet
couldn't destroy the whole planet.

705
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,440
It'd take a thousand ships
with more firepower than I've--

706
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:48,240
- There's another ship coming in.
- Maybe they know what happened.

707
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,660
It's an imperial fighter.

708
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,290
- It followed us.
- No. It's a short-range fighter.

709
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,540
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

710
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,550
Sure is leaving in a hurry.
If they identify us, we're in trouble.

711
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,760
Not if I can help it.
Chewie, jam its transmissions.

712
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,220
- Let it go. It's too far out of range.
- Not for long.

713
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,310
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

714
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,060
He must have gotten lost,
been part of a convoy or something.

715
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,060
He ain't gonna be around
long enough to tell anybody about us.

716
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,440
He's heading for that small moon.

717
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:28,070
I can get him before he gets there.
He's almost in range.

718
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,740
That's no moon.

719
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:35,200
- It's a space station.
- It's too big to be a space station.

720
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,960
I have a very bad feeling about this.

721
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,920
Turn the ship around.

722
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,260
Yeah. I think you're right. Full reverse.

723
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:54,260
Chewie, lock in the auxiliary power.

724
01:04:56,270 --> 01:04:58,230
Why are we still moving towards it?

725
01:04:58,310 --> 01:05:00,150
We're caught in a tractor beam.
It's pulling us in.

726
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,900
There's gotta be something you can do.

727
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:04,730
There's nothing I can do.
I'm at full power. I have to shut down.

728
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,320
They're not gonna get me without a fight.

729
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,450
You can't win, but there are
alternatives to fighting.

730
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,220
Clear Bay 327.

731
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:35,680
We are opening the magnetic field.

732
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,200
To your stations. Come with me.

733
01:05:56,830 --> 01:06:00,250
Close all outboard shields.
Close all outboard shields.

734
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:02,920
Yes?

735
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.

736
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:09,920
Its markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

737
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:13,840
They must be trying to return
the stolen plans to the princess.

738
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:17,010
She may yet be of some use to us.

739
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:25,360
Unlock 1, 5, 7 and 9. Release charge.

740
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,610
There's no one on board, sir.

741
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,490
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.

742
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,080
It must be a decoy.
Several escape pods have been jettisoned.

743
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,120
- Did you find any droids?
- No, sir.

744
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,080
If there were any,
they must also have jettisoned.

745
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:48,670
Send a scanning crew aboard.
I want every part of this ship checked.

746
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,010
Yes, sir.

747
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:51,670
I sense something...

748
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,220
a presence I've not felt since--

749
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,350
Get me a scanning crew in here.
I want every part of this ship checked.

750
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,320
There's no one here.

751
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,330
Boy, it's lucky you have
these compartments.

752
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,540
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in 'em.

753
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,830
This is ridiculous.

754
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,460
Even if I could take off,
I'd never get past the tractor beam.

755
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:30,880
Leave that to me.

756
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,010
Damn fool. I knew you were gonna say that.

757
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:37,590
Who's the more foolish,
the fool or the fool who follows him?

758
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:50,860
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it immediately.

759
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,940
All right. Let's go.

760
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,630
Hey, down there.

761
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,300
Could you give us a hand with this?

762
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,140
TK-421, why aren't you at your post?

763
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,310
TK-421, do you copy?

764
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,280
Take over. We've got a bad transmitter.
I'll see what I can do.

765
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,510
Between his howling
and your blasting everything...

766
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,640
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

767
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,020
Bring 'em on. I prefer a straight fight
to sneakin' around.

768
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,900
We've found the computer outlet, sir.

769
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,020
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire imperial network.

770
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,710
He's found the controls to the power beam
that's holding the ship here.

771
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,670
He'll try to make the precise location
appear on the monitor.

772
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:36,000
The tractor beam is coupled
to the main reactor in seven locations.

773
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:39,130
A power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

774
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,140
I don't think you boys can help.
I must go alone.

775
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,640
Whatever you say. I've done more than
I bargained for on this trip already.

776
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:52,600
- I want to go with you.
- Be patient, Luke. Watch the droids.

777
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:54,650
They must be delivered safely...

778
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:57,940
or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan.

779
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,360
Your destiny lies along
a different path from mine.

780
01:10:04,910 --> 01:10:06,910
The Force will be with you...

781
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:08,410
always.

782
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,220
You said it, Chewie.

783
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,720
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

784
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,350
Ben is a great man.

785
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,390
- Great at getting us into trouble.
- I didn't hear you give any ideas.

786
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:31,520
Anything's better than just hangin'
around waiting for 'em to pick us up.

787
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,940
Who do you think--

788
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:37,270
- What is it?
- I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

789
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:39,940
He says, "I've found her,"
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

790
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,650
Who? Who has he found?

791
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,490
- Princess Leia.
- The princess? She's here?

792
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,280
- Princess?
- Where is she?

793
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,290
Princess? What's going on?

794
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:57,500
Level 5, Detention Block AA-23.

795
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,970
I'm afraid she's scheduled
to be terminated.

796
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:08,050
Oh, no. We've gotta do something.

797
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,600
- What are you talking about?
- The droids belong to her.

798
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,600
She's the one in the message.
We gotta help her.

799
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,560
Don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait here.

800
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:18,940
He didn't know she was here.
Find a way into that detention block.

801
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,480
- I'm not going anywhere.
- They're gonna execute her.

802
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:25,160
You said you didn't want to just wait
to be captured. Now you want to stay?

803
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,330
Marching into the detention area
is not what I had in mind.

804
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,240
- But they're gonna kill her.
- Better her than me.

805
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,340
She's rich.

806
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,340
Rich?

807
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:49,050
Rich, powerful. If you were to
rescue her, the reward would be--

808
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,930
- What?
- Well, more wealth than you can imagine.

809
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:54,020
I don't know. I can imagine quite a bit.

810
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:56,190
- You'll get it.
- I better.

811
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,770
You will.

812
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:00,320
All right, kid.
You better be right about this.

813
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,400
- All right.
- What's your plan?

814
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:05,900
3PO, hand me those binders there,
will you?

815
01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:08,870
Okay.

816
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,490
Now, I'm gonna put these on you.

817
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,830
Okay, Han, you put those on.

818
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,380
Don't worry, Chewie.
I think I know what he has in mind.

819
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,880
Master Luke, sir, pardon me for asking...

820
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,220
but what should R2 and I do
if we're discovered here?

821
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,140
- Lock the door.
- And hope they don't have blasters.

822
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,260
That isn't very reassuring.

823
01:12:51,570 --> 01:12:56,200
517 to scan control.
517 to scan control.

824
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:24,940
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

825
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:59,060
- This is not gonna work.
- Why didn't you say so before?

826
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,140
I did say so before.

827
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:19,330
Where are you taking this... thing?

828
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:22,170
Prisoner transfer from Cell Block 1138.

829
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,420
I wasn't notified.

830
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
I'll have to clear it.

831
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,390
- Look out! He's loose!
- He'll tear us all apart!

832
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,500
Look out.

833
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:14,510
We gotta find out which cell
this princess of yours is in.

834
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:16,800
Here it is-- 2187. You go and get her.

835
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,890
I'll hold them here.

836
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,440
Everything's under control.
Situation normal.

837
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,730
What happened?

838
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:28,730
Had a slight weapons malfunction...

839
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:31,150
but everything's perfectly all right now.

840
01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:34,490
We're fine. We're all fine here now.
Thank you.

841
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:37,240
- How are you?
- We're sending a squad up.

842
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:41,410
Negative, negative.
We have a reactor leak here now.

843
01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:45,420
Give us a few minutes to lock it down.
Large leak, very dangerous.

844
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,080
Who is this? What's your operating number?

845
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,970
Boring conversation anyway.
Luke, we're gonna have company!

846
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,150
Aren't you a little short
for a stormtrooper?

847
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,030
Oh, the uniform.

848
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,530
I'm Luke Skywalker.
I'm here to rescue you.

849
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:19,660
- You're who?
- I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit.

850
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,700
- I'm here with Ben Kenobi.
- Ben Kenobi? Where is he?

851
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:22,870
Come on.

852
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:28,080
- He is here.
- Obi-Wan Kenobi?

853
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:32,170
- What makes you think so?
- A tremor in the Force.

854
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,090
The last time I felt it
was in the presence of my old master.

855
01:16:36,170 --> 01:16:38,640
Surely he must be dead by now.

856
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,140
Don't underestimate the Force.

857
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,480
The Jedi are extinct.
Their fire has gone out of the universe.

858
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:48,900
You, my friend, are all that's left
of their religion.

859
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,900
Yes.

860
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:54,480
We have an emergency alert
in Detention Block AA-23.

861
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:57,700
The princess? Put all sections on alert.

862
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,490
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

863
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:04,410
If you're right,
he must not be allowed to escape.

864
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:08,000
Escape is not his plan.
I must face him alone.

865
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:18,840
Get behind me. Get behind me.

866
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,020
Watch your left.
They went down the cell bay.

867
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:38,950
- Can't get out that way.
- You cut off our only escape route.

868
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,570
Maybe you'd like it back in your cell,
Your Highness.

869
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:46,290
- C-3PO. C-3PO.
- Yes, sir?

870
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:49,870
Are there any other ways out of
the cell bay? We've been cut off.

871
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:54,290
What was that? I didn't copy.

872
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,840
I said all systems have been
alerted to your presence, sir.

873
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:00,470
The main entrance
seems to be the only way in or out.

874
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:02,800
All other information on your level
is restricted.

875
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:05,470
Open up in there. Open up in there.

876
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,140
Oh, no.

877
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:09,850
There isn't any other way out.

878
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,610
I can't hold them off forever. Now what?

879
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:21,240
This is some rescue. When you came in here,
didn't you have a plan for getting out?

880
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:23,370
He's the brains, sweetheart.

881
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:25,200
Well, I didn't--

882
01:18:26,330 --> 01:18:29,870
- What the hell are you doing?
- Somebody has to save our skins.

883
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,880
Into the garbage chute, flyboy.

884
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:42,380
Get in there!

885
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,550
Get in there, you big furry oaf.
I don't care what you smell.

886
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,100
Get in there, and don't worry about it.

887
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,600
Wonderful girl.

888
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:58,940
Either I'm gonna kill her,
or I'm beginning to like her.

889
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,400
Get in there.

890
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,550
The garbage chute was
a really wonderful idea.

891
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:21,090
What an incredible smell
you've discovered.

892
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,890
Let's get out of here.

893
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,310
- Get away from there.
- No, wait.

894
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:37,520
Forget it! I already tried it!
It's magnetically sealed.

895
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,860
Put that thing away!
You're gonna get us all killed!

896
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,900
Absolutely, Your Worship.

897
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:44,320
Look, I had everything under control
till you led us down here.

898
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,370
It's not gonna take 'em long
to figure out what happened to us.

899
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,740
It could be worse.

900
01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:54,580
It's worse.

901
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,750
- There's something alive in here.
- That's your imagination.

902
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:00,630
Something just moved past my leg.

903
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:05,380
- Look. Did you see that?
- What?

904
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,530
Kid! Luke!

905
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:43,050
Grab hold of this!

906
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:45,550
Blast it! My gun's jammed.

907
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,390
- Where?
- Anywhere!

908
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,630
Help him!

909
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,710
- What happened?
- I don't know.

910
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,630
It just let go of me and disappeared.

911
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,680
I got a bad feeling about this.

912
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:44,940
- The walls are moving!
- Try and brace it with something.

913
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,450
Help me.

914
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,840
Wait a minute.

915
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:14,930
3PO! Come in, 3PO!

916
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,680
3PO!

917
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:19,810
Where could he be?

918
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,190
Take over. See to him.

919
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:30,150
Look, there.

920
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,950
They're madmen.
They're heading for the prison level.

921
01:22:35,030 --> 01:22:36,950
If you hurry, you might catch them.

922
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,540
Follow me.

923
01:22:42,250 --> 01:22:44,290
You stand guard.

924
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:49,840
Come on.

925
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,430
All this excitement has overrun
the circuits in my counterpart here.

926
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,650
If you don't mind, I'd like to
take him down to maintenance.

927
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,310
All right.

928
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,200
3PO. Come in, 3PO.

929
01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:22,580
3PO.

930
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:25,500
- Get on top.
- I can't.

931
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:27,500
Where could he be? 3PO.

932
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,710
3PO, will you come in?

933
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,720
They aren't here.
Something must have happened to them.

934
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,010
See if they've been captured. Hurry.

935
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:43,270
One thing's for sure.
We're all gonna be a lot thinner.

936
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,900
- Get on top of it.
- I'm trying.

937
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:56,610
Thank goodness they haven't found them.
Where could they be?

938
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,490
"Use the comlink"? Oh, my.

939
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,540
I forgot. I turned it off.

940
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,840
- Are you there, sir?
- 3PO?

941
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,420
- We've had some problems.
- Shut up and listen to me.

942
01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:17,260
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level. Do you copy?

943
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:24,140
Shut down all the garbage mashers
on the detention level!

944
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:26,980
No, shut them all down. Hurry! Oh, no.

945
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:39,950
What?

946
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,910
You did great, 3PO!

947
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:45,370
Listen to them. They're dying, R2.

948
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:47,460
Curse my metal body. I wasn't fast enough.

949
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,840
It's all my fault. My poor master.

950
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,500
We're all right. You did great!

951
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:57,300
Hey! Open the pressure maintenance hatch
on unit number-- Where are we?

952
01:24:57,380 --> 01:25:00,760
3263827.

953
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,100
If we can avoid any more female advice,
we oughta be able to get out of here.

954
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:52,060
Let's get moving.

955
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:55,440
Where you goin'?

956
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:57,030
Wait! They'll hear!

957
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,950
Come here, you big coward.

958
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,700
- Chewie, come here.
- Listen.

959
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:06,330
I don't know who you are
or where you came from...

960
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:09,250
but from now on,
you do as I tell you, okay?

961
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:13,080
Look, Your Worshipfulness,
let's get one thing straight.

962
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:15,840
I take orders from just one person-- me.

963
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:18,470
It's a wonder you're still alive.

964
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:21,760
Will somebody get
this big walking carpet out of my way?

965
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,140
No reward is worth this.

966
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:36,270
Give me regular reports, please.

967
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:37,440
Right.

968
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:42,910
- Do you know what's going on?
- Maybe it's another drill.

969
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:49,950
You seen that new VT-16?

970
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,500
Yeah. Some of the other guys
were telling me about it.

971
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,500
They say it's quite a thing to see.

972
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:56,590
What was that?

973
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:59,920
It's nothing. Outgassing.
Don't worry about it.

974
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,970
- There she is.
- C-3PO, do you copy?

975
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:08,140
Yes, sir.

976
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:10,100
- Are you safe?
- For the moment.

977
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,560
We're in the main hangar
across from the ship.

978
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:16,150
We're right above you. Stand by.

979
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:19,030
You came in that thing?
You're braver than I thought.

980
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:21,110
Nice. Come on.

981
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:26,410
It's them. Blast them.

982
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:29,410
Get back to the ship!

983
01:27:29,490 --> 01:27:31,450
- Where are you going?
- He certainly has courage.

984
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:35,250
What good will it do us
if he gets himself killed? Come on.

985
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:02,150
I think we took a wrong turn.

986
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,030
There's no lock.

987
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,040
- That oughta hold them for a while.
- Quick. We've got to get across.

988
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,290
- Find the controls to extend the bridge.
- I think I just blasted it.

989
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,170
They're coming through.

990
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,190
Here, hold this.

991
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:01,590
Here they come.

992
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:14,520
For luck.

993
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:24,650
We think they may be splitting up.
They may be on Level 5 and 6 now, sir.

994
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,500
Where could they be?

995
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:47,130
Close the blast doors.

996
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:56,730
Open the blast doors.
Open the blast doors.

997
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:19,870
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again at last.

998
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,330
The circle is now complete.

999
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,630
When I left you, I was but the learner.

1000
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:27,090
Now I am the master.

1001
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:29,170
Only a master of evil, Darth.

1002
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:51,780
Your powers are weak, old man.

1003
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:55,530
You can't win, Darth.
If you strike me down...

1004
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:59,000
I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

1005
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,510
You should not have come back.

1006
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,870
Didn't we just leave this party?

1007
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:40,870
- What kept you?
- We ran into some old friends.

1008
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:43,460
- The ship all right?
- Seems okay, if we can get to it.

1009
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,670
I hope the old man got
the tractor beam down.

1010
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,390
Look.

1011
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,060
Come on, R2. We're going.

1012
01:32:08,730 --> 01:32:09,860
Now's our chance. Go!

1013
01:32:39,970 --> 01:32:43,680
Come on!

1014
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:46,900
- Luke, it's too late!
- Blast the door, kid!

1015
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:58,070
Run, Luke, run.

1016
01:33:01,990 --> 01:33:06,460
I hope that old man got the tractor beam down,
or this is gonna be a short trip. Hit it!

1017
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,950
We're coming up on their sentry ships.

1018
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:43,450
Hold them off. Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main guns.

1019
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:54,630
I can't believe he's gone.

1020
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:00,050
There wasn't anything you could have done.

1021
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:03,140
Come on, buddy. We're not out of this yet.

1022
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,240
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp.

1023
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,210
Here they come.

1024
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,060
They're coming in too fast!

1025
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:05,910
- We've lost the lateral controls.
- Don't worry. She'll hold together.

1026
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,450
Hear me, baby? Hold together.

1027
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,140
Got him. I got him!

1028
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:35,650
Great, kid. Don't get cocky.

1029
01:35:36,820 --> 01:35:38,610
There's still two more.

1030
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:15,020
- That's it. We did it.
- We did it.

1031
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,820
Help. I think I'm melting.
This is all your fault.

1032
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:28,240
Are they away?

1033
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:30,700
They've just made the jump
into hyperspace.

1034
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:34,790
You're sure the homing beacon
is secure aboard their ship?

1035
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,380
I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.

1036
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,380
This had better work.

1037
01:36:40,590 --> 01:36:42,710
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?

1038
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:46,510
You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.

1039
01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:48,930
That doesn't sound too hard.

1040
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:52,680
They let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our escape.

1041
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:55,560
- You call that easy?
- They're tracking us.

1042
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,480
Not this ship, sister.

1043
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:01,230
At least the information in R2
is still intact.

1044
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,780
What's so important? What's he carrying?

1045
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,070
The technical readouts
of that battle station.

1046
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:10,370
I only hope that when the data's
analyzed a weakness can be found.

1047
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:13,830
- It's not over yet.
- It is for me, sister.

1048
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:17,290
I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess.

1049
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:20,250
I expect to be well paid.
I'm in it for the money.

1050
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,550
You needn't worry about your reward.

1051
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:25,550
If money is all that you love,
then that's what you'll receive.

1052
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,640
Your friend is quite a mercenary.

1053
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:33,970
I wonder if he really cares
about anything... or anybody.

1054
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,560
I care.

1055
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:44,820
So...

1056
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,820
what do you think of her, Han?

1057
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:48,780
I'm trying not to, kid.

1058
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:50,910
Good.

1059
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:57,250
Still, she's got a lot of spirit.

1060
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,420
What do you think?
You think a princess and a guy like me--

1061
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:03,130
No.

1062
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:53,970
You're safe. When we heard about
Alderaan, we feared the worst.

1063
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:55,970
We have no time for sorrows, Commander.

1064
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,060
You must use the information
in this R2 unit to help plan the attack.

1065
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:01,140
It's our only hope.

1066
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,960
- Yes.
- We're approaching the planet Yavin.

1067
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,380
The rebel base is on a moon
on the far side.

1068
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:29,460
We are preparing to orbit the planet.

1069
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,560
The battle station is heavily shielded...

1070
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:44,100
and carries a firepower
greater than half the starfleet.

1071
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:48,900
Its defenses are designed around
a direct large-scale assault.

1072
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:54,240
A small, one-man fighter should be able
to penetrate the outer defense.

1073
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:59,790
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good
are snub fighters against that?

1074
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:04,460
The Empire doesn't consider a small,
one-man fighter to be any threat...

1075
01:40:04,540 --> 01:40:06,540
or they'd have a tighter defense.

1076
01:40:07,380 --> 01:40:10,670
An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia...

1077
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,840
has demonstrated a weakness
in the battle station.

1078
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:16,640
The approach will not be easy.

1079
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:19,890
You're required to maneuver
straight down this trench...

1080
01:40:19,970 --> 01:40:22,600
and skim the surface to this point.

1081
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,150
The target area is only two meters wide.

1082
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:29,900
It's a small thermal exhaust port
right below the main port.

1083
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:34,360
The shaft leads directly
to the reactor system.

1084
01:40:34,450 --> 01:40:37,200
A precise hit
will start a chain reaction...

1085
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,490
which should destroy the station.

1086
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:43,120
Only a precise hit will
set up a chain reaction.

1087
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,370
The shaft is ray-shielded,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

1088
01:40:46,460 --> 01:40:48,630
That's impossible, even for a computer.

1089
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:52,510
No, it's not. I used to bull's-eye
womp rats in my T-16 back home.

1090
01:40:52,590 --> 01:40:55,010
They're not much bigger than two meters.

1091
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:58,260
Then man your ships,
and may the Force be with you.

1092
01:41:06,520 --> 01:41:09,110
Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.

1093
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:13,490
The moon with the rebel base
will be in range in 30 minutes.

1094
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:16,200
This will be a day long remembered.

1095
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:18,280
It has seen the end of Kenobi...

1096
01:41:18,370 --> 01:41:20,950
and will soon see
the end of the rebellion.

1097
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:29,130
All flight crews, man your stations.

1098
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:38,550
So, you got your reward
and you're just leaving, then?

1099
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,640
That's right. Yeah.

1100
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:44,350
I got some old debts
I gotta pay off with this stuff.

1101
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:48,520
Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be
fool enough to stick around here, do ya?

1102
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,230
Why don't you come with us?
You're pretty good in a fight. We could use ya.

1103
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:55,320
Come on. Why don't you take a look around?

1104
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:58,070
You know what's about to happen,
what they're up against.

1105
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:00,950
They could use a good pilot like you.
You're turning your back on them.

1106
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:03,450
What good's a reward
if you ain't around to use it?

1107
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,500
Besides, attacking that battle station
ain't my idea of courage.

1108
01:42:06,580 --> 01:42:09,500
It's more like... suicide.

1109
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:14,130
All right.
Well, take care of yourself, Han.

1110
01:42:14,210 --> 01:42:16,880
I guess that's what you're best at,
isn't it?

1111
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,340
Hey, Luke.

1112
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:24,010
May the Force be with you.

1113
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:33,730
What are you looking at?
I know what I'm doing.

1114
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,610
All pilots to your stations.

1115
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:51,790
- What's wrong?
- It's Han.

1116
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:54,380
I don't know.
I really thought he'd change his mind.

1117
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,010
He's got to follow his own path.
No one can choose it for him.

1118
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:01,470
I only wish Ben were here.

1119
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,480
Open main launch tubes.

1120
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,400
Main launch tubes opening, sir.

1121
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:16,150
Hey, Luke!

1122
01:43:16,230 --> 01:43:19,440
- Biggs!
- I don't believe it. How are ya?

1123
01:43:19,530 --> 01:43:21,610
- Coming up?
- I'll be up there with you.

1124
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,030
- Have I got stories to tell you.
- Skywalker.

1125
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:27,620
Are you sure you can handle this ship?

1126
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:31,120
Sir, Luke is the best bush pilot
in the outer-rim territories.

1127
01:43:31,830 --> 01:43:34,330
- You'll do all right.
- Thank you, sir. I'll try.

1128
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:38,340
Gotta get aboard. We'll hear all your
stories when we get back, all right?

1129
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:41,170
Hey, Biggs.
I told you I'd make it someday.

1130
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:44,260
It'll be like old times, Luke.
They'll never stop us.

1131
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:50,060
This R2 unit of yours seems
a bit beat up. You want a new one?

1132
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:53,310
Not on your life. That droid and I
have been through a lot.

1133
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:54,440
You okay, R2?

1134
01:43:56,060 --> 01:43:57,480
Good.

1135
01:43:58,530 --> 01:44:01,280
Gold squadron, begin takeoff procedure.

1136
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,950
Hang on tight, R2.
You've got to come back.

1137
01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:08,830
You wouldn't want my life
to get boring, would you?

1138
01:44:57,170 --> 01:45:00,170
Luke, the Force will be with you.

1139
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:15,730
Standby alert. Death Star approaching.

1140
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,980
Estimated time to firing range,
15 minutes.

1141
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:34,330
- All wings report in.
- Red 10 standing by.

1142
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:36,670
- Red Seven standing by.
- Red Three standing by.

1143
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:39,500
- Red Six standing by.
- Red Nine standing by.

1144
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:41,630
- Red Two standing by.
- Red 11 standing by.

1145
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:43,670
Red Five standing by.

1146
01:45:45,010 --> 01:45:46,930
Lock S-foils in attack position.

1147
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:53,180
We're passing through the magnetic field.

1148
01:45:53,260 --> 01:45:56,060
Hold tight. Switch your deflectors on.

1149
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:57,600
Double front.

1150
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:02,400
Look at the size of that thing.

1151
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:05,110
Cut the chatter, Red Two.
Accelerate to attack speed.

1152
01:46:08,490 --> 01:46:11,240
- This is it, boys.
- Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

1153
01:46:11,320 --> 01:46:14,200
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- We're starting for the target shaft.

1154
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:17,750
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and draw their fire.

1155
01:46:32,180 --> 01:46:35,470
- Heavy fire, boss, 23 degrees.
- I see it. Stay low.

1156
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,440
This is Red Five. I'm going in.

1157
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:49,990
Luke, pull up!

1158
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:53,990
- You all right?
- A little cooked, but I'm okay.

1159
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:03,880
We count 30 rebel ships, but they're so
small they're evading our turbolasers.

1160
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,880
We'll have to destroy them ship to ship.

1161
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:08,090
Get the crews to their fighters.

1162
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:14,510
Watch yourself. There's a lot of fire coming from
the right side of that deflection tower.

1163
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:15,890
I'm on it.

1164
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:19,430
- I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins.
- Right with you, Red Three.

1165
01:47:25,770 --> 01:47:27,570
I've got a problem here.

1166
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:29,070
- Eject.
- I can hold it.

1167
01:47:29,150 --> 01:47:31,320
- Pull up!
- No, I'm all right--

1168
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:38,500
The rebel base will be in firing range
in seven minutes.

1169
01:47:42,330 --> 01:47:45,000
Luke, trust your feelings.

1170
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,470
Squad leaders...

1171
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:56,600
we've picked up a new group of signals.

1172
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,640
Enemy fighters coming your way.

1173
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:00,430
My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

1174
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:02,730
- Pick up your visual scanning.
- Here they come.

1175
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,690
You've got one on your tail.

1176
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,910
I'm hit!

1177
01:48:15,370 --> 01:48:17,910
- You've picked one up. Watch it.
- I can't see it.

1178
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,660
He's on me tight. I can't shake him.

1179
01:48:23,330 --> 01:48:25,380
I'll be right there.

1180
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:41,020
Several fighters have broken off
from the main group. Come with me.

1181
01:48:44,440 --> 01:48:47,560
- Fall in. Fall in.
- Watch your back, Luke.

1182
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:50,030
Fighters above you, coming in.

1183
01:48:56,240 --> 01:48:58,990
I'm hit, but not bad.
R2, see what you can do with it.

1184
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,240
Hang on back there.

1185
01:49:01,330 --> 01:49:04,000
Red Six, can you see Red Five?

1186
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,500
There's a heavy fire zone.
Red Five, where are you?

1187
01:49:06,580 --> 01:49:08,040
I can't shake him.

1188
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,590
I'm on him, Luke.

1189
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,430
Blast it, Biggs. Where are you?

1190
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,230
- Thanks, Wedge.
- Good shooting, Wedge.

1191
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:31,440
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.
We're starting our attack run.

1192
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:35,650
I copy, Gold Leader. Move into position.

1193
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:40,370
Stay in attack formation.

1194
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:43,290
The exhaust port is marked and locked in.

1195
01:49:49,170 --> 01:49:55,630
Switch all power
to front deflector screen.

1196
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:02,100
How many guns do you think, Gold Five?

1197
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:05,430
Say about 20 guns,
some on the surface, some on the towers.

1198
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,350
Death Star will be in range
in five minutes.

1199
01:50:10,480 --> 01:50:13,530
Switch to targeting computer.

1200
01:50:15,990 --> 01:50:17,990
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

1201
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:22,490
The guns. They've stopped.

1202
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:26,750
Stabilize your rear deflectors.
Watch for enemy fighters.

1203
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:29,330
They're coming in. Three marks at 210.

1204
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:33,460
I'll take them myself. Cover me.

1205
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:34,840
Yes, sir.

1206
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:51,810
- It's no good. I can't maneuver.
- Stay on target.

1207
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:53,820
- We're too close.
- Stay on target.

1208
01:50:55,570 --> 01:50:56,530
Loosen up!

1209
01:50:59,530 --> 01:51:02,410
Gold Five to Red Leader,
lost Tiree, lost Hutch.

1210
01:51:02,490 --> 01:51:04,870
- I copy, Gold Leader.
- They came from behind.

1211
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:13,840
We've analyzed their attack, sir,
and there is a danger.

1212
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,840
Should I have your ship standing by?

1213
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,800
Evacuate? In our moment of triumph?

1214
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,380
I think you overestimate their chances.

1215
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:24,100
Rebel base, three minutes and closing.

1216
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:26,720
Red boys, this is Red Leader.

1217
01:51:26,810 --> 01:51:28,520
Rendezvous at mark 6.1.

1218
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:32,150
- This is Red Two flying toward you.
- Red Three standing by.

1219
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:34,190
Red Leader, this is Base One.

1220
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,940
Keep half your group out of range
for the next run.

1221
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:39,650
Copy, Base One.
Luke, take Red Two and Three.

1222
01:51:39,740 --> 01:51:43,070
Hold up here and wait for
my signal to start your run.

1223
01:51:51,540 --> 01:51:52,750
This is it.

1224
01:51:57,300 --> 01:51:59,420
We should be able to see it by now.

1225
01:52:01,090 --> 01:52:02,880
Keep your eyes open for those fighters.

1226
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:07,060
There's too much interference.
Red Five, can you see them?

1227
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:10,140
- No sign of any-- Wait. Coming in .35.
- I see them.

1228
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:12,770
I'm in range.

1229
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,770
Target's coming up.

1230
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,490
Just hold them off for a few seconds.

1231
01:52:21,320 --> 01:52:22,950
Close up formation.

1232
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,450
Almost there.

1233
01:52:35,540 --> 01:52:38,800
- Let her loose. They're right behind me.
- Almost there.

1234
01:52:40,170 --> 01:52:41,840
I can't hold them.

1235
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:50,810
It's away!

1236
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:56,940
- It's a hit!
- Negative.

1237
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,110
Negative. It didn't go in.

1238
01:52:59,190 --> 01:53:01,860
It just impacted on the surface.

1239
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:09,990
Red Leader, we're right above you.

1240
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:12,250
Turn to .05. We'll cover for you.

1241
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:15,290
Stay there. I just lost
my starboard engine.

1242
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,340
Get set up for your attack run.

1243
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:34,310
Rebel base, one minute and closing.

1244
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:36,600
Biggs, Wedge, let's close it up.

1245
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:40,070
We're going in full throttle. That ought
to keep those fighters off our back.

1246
01:53:40,150 --> 01:53:42,280
Right with you, boss.

1247
01:53:42,360 --> 01:53:44,650
At that speed,
will you be able to pull out in time?

1248
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:46,740
It'll be just like
Beggars Canyon back home.

1249
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,330
We'll stay back far enough to cover you.

1250
01:53:56,410 --> 01:53:59,000
My scope shows the tower,
but I can't see the exhaust port.

1251
01:53:59,080 --> 01:54:00,540
Are you sure the computer can hit it?

1252
01:54:04,050 --> 01:54:06,050
Watch yourself.
Increase speed, full throttle.

1253
01:54:06,130 --> 01:54:07,430
What about that tower?

1254
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:09,930
You worry about those fighters.
I'll worry about the tower.

1255
01:54:16,350 --> 01:54:19,940
R2, that stabilizer's broken loose
again. See if you can't lock it down.

1256
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:30,910
Fighters coming in .3.

1257
01:54:39,830 --> 01:54:42,340
- I'm hit. I can't stay with you.
- Get clear, Wedge.

1258
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:44,920
- You can't do any more good back there.
- Sorry.

1259
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:47,920
Let him go. Stay on the leader.

1260
01:54:50,890 --> 01:54:53,100
Hurry, Luke.
They're coming in much faster this time.

1261
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:59,980
R2, try and increase the power.

1262
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,610
Hurry up, Luke. Quick.

1263
01:55:07,530 --> 01:55:08,650
Quick.

1264
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:18,250
Rebel base, 30 seconds and closing.

1265
01:55:18,330 --> 01:55:19,460
I'm on the leader.

1266
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,420
Hang on, R2.

1267
01:55:39,810 --> 01:55:42,400
Use the Force, Luke.

1268
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,650
Let go, Luke.

1269
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:51,490
The Force is strong with this one.

1270
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:53,530
Luke, trust me.

1271
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:00,540
His computer's off.

1272
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:02,750
You switched off your
targeting computer. What's wrong?

1273
01:56:02,830 --> 01:56:05,500
Nothing. I'm all right.

1274
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:19,680
I've lost R2.

1275
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:26,060
The Death Star has cleared the planet.

1276
01:56:27,110 --> 01:56:28,730
Rebel base in range.

1277
01:56:28,820 --> 01:56:30,740
You may fire when ready.

1278
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:32,900
Commence primary ignition.

1279
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,340
I have you now.

1280
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,920
What?

1281
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:55,390
Look out.

1282
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:05,060
You're all clear, kid.
Now let's blow this thing and go home.

1283
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:17,950
Stand by.

1284
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:30,380
Great shot, kid!
That was one in a million!

1285
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:36,260
Remember, the Force
will be with you always.

1286
01:58:01,620 --> 01:58:03,500
I just knew you'd come back.

1287
01:58:03,580 --> 01:58:06,120
I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

1288
01:58:06,210 --> 01:58:08,170
I knew there was more to you than money.

1289
01:58:08,830 --> 01:58:10,130
Oh, no.

1290
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:12,670
Oh, my. R2, can you hear me?

1291
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:16,220
Say something.
You can repair him, can't you?

1292
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:19,550
- We'll get to work on him right away.
- You must repair him.

1293
01:58:19,640 --> 01:58:22,560
Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

1294
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:24,640
He'll be all right.

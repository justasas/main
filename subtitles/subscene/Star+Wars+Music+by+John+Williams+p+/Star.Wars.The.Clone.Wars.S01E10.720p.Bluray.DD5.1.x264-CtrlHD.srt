General! I know you're watching.

We've seen the lower levels of your home.

179

We're not impressed.

Good, Jedi. Good!

182
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:47,075
You will provide some sport for me yet.

183

185
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,759
Stand firm. There might be
worse things here than Grievous.

186
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,305
Looks like you're right about that, sir.

Master, the armor patches
are getting cold,

192
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,157
and contrary to your belief,
I do have other things to do.

193
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,452
Proceed with my repair.

194
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:35,039
Sometimes, I wonder
why you submitted to the changes.

195
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:40,295
Improvements! I submit to no one!
I chose them!

196
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,422
Now get on with it.

197
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,392
There may be some discomfort.

206
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,950
Grievous is going to pay for this.

207
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,701
I will destroy him.

208
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,373
I understand your pain,
but you forget your teachings, Nahdar.

209
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,708
Revenge is not the Jedi way.

210
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,589
But in this war, strength prevails.
The rules have changed.

211
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,550
Perhaps you are the one who has changed.

212
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,931
Come, now. We need to keep moving.

213
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,693
Let's see if Gor is finished
playing with the Jedi.

214
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,988
Huh?

215
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,199
Where are they? Gor?

<i>Your recent defeats at their hands</i>

221
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:56,139
<i>in your ability to lead the Droid Army.</i>

222
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:01,269
<i>I'm sure you can understand</i>
<i>my need to reassess your effectiveness.</i>

223
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,859
You! You deactivated my guards!
You let the Jedi in here!

224
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,862
So you would test me!

225
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,907
<i>I do hope you emerge victorious.</i>

<i>It's time for you...</i>

228
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,666
All right, Count. I'll play your little game.

229
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,712
In your condition, you need your rest.

230
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,465
I will rest when the Jedi are dead.

231
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:42,018
You were right, Master.
That exit must lead to the control room.

232
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,861
Uh-oh.

233
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,198
What have we here? The uninvited guests.

234
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,283

-Nahdar, inside. Hurry!
-No, you go! I will hold him off!

237
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,293
There's no time to argue!

238
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,629

I have been waiting for this.

Nahdar!

Wait. Where's the other Jedi?

You might have been
a proud warrior once,

but now you're just a pawn

To answer power with power,

There is no evidence of any weapons

At least the Jedi escaped.

Yes, but they nearly brought harm
to our entire village.

Yes, but for the moment.
And at what price?

Are you not concerned
about the Jedi at all?

I have no quarrel with the Jedi,

63
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,897
but we cannot help them
without being drawn into their war.

64
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,360

65
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,530
Follow them
and make sure they get off-world.

66

You know, I can't figure those villagers
not wanting to fight.

67

No pride, I guess.

I call it no courage.

Sometimes it takes courage
to stick to one's beliefs, young Padawan,

70

72

And I think the only one around here
belongs to the Separatists.

We know they have a landing ship.
They might have a shuttle.

-Let's take them with us.

169
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,556
Everyone, please. Please listen.

170
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,808
The Separatists will be here in moments.

171
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,186
What are you doing here?
I told you not to return.

172
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,815
I'm afraid the Separatists don't care
whether you're in the war or not.

173
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,234
We need to get you to safety
before they arrive.

174
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,528
We will not abandon our homes.

175
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,866
But they've got a new weapon.
It'll burn this place to a crisp.

176
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,452
Is this what all of you really want?

177
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:17,248
If it is our destiny
to be destroyed in your war, so be it.

178
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,552
Droids, inbound.
We've got eight minutes tops.

179
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:33,473
Come on, guys! Let's get these
shield generators in place!

180
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:45,151
When Count Dooku sees how successful
my weapon is against civilian targets,

181
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:52,116
I will no doubt be promoted to a more
substantial position within the Alliance.

182
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,953
Okay. Right.

183
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,247
The villagers appear
to have put some pods together

184
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,999
in a barrier around the village.

185
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,292
Pods?

186
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,961
<font color="#DF01D7">(LAUGHING)</font>

187
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,963
How quaint.

188
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:11,177
Jedi? What are they doing out here? Halt!

189
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:19,852
Please stop what you're doing.
Stop building that wall.

190
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,813
I did not ask you to defend us.

191
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,731
This battle is inevitable.

192
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,568
You can stand by your beliefs,
but let us stand by ours.

193
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,742
Thank you for what you're trying to do.
I'm sorry, but I cannot help.

194
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,414
My father is very strong-willed
and set in tradition.

195
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,376
Many others agree with me, but
we were raised under a very strict code.

196
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,421
We must respect it even if we don't agree.

197
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,592
They're holding position.

198
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,263
They're not going to charge us.
Not if they can hit us from long range first.

199
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,850
But if we can withstand that weapon,
we'll draw them in.

200
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,685
Prepare to fire!

201
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,946
Goodbye, Jedi. Fire!

202
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,534
Incoming!

203
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,121
Power the shields!

<font color="#DF01D7">(RUMBLING)</font>

205
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:50,318
Now, they'll have to get their hands dirty
and meet us face to face.

206
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,987
Squad One, prepare to charge!

207
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,864
Prepare to charge.

208
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,034
Charge!

209
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,372
That's a lot of clankers.

210
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,042
We've got to stop them
before they get through that shield.

211
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:40,535
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.

212
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,704
Sir, the First Squad has been destroyed.

214

Squad Two and Three, attack!

215
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,045
-That wasn't so tough.
-That was just the first wave.

216
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:02,265
Snips, get back to the village!
I'll take care of the new weapon.

217
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,521
That's it! We have to retreat!

218
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,570
Take cover. They've breached the shield!

219
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,578
They're taking out the shield generators.

220
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,746
We have to do something.

221
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:42,346
Their shield is down. Launch another shell.

222
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,108
Sir, there's a Jedi heading right for us.

223
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,611
Then blast him, you idiot!

224
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,493
No survivors.

225
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,166
Wag Too, what are you doing?

226
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,835
-We're going to help.
-I forbid this!

227
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,462
What more would you have them do

228
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,964
before we are allowed
to defend ourselves?

229
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:19,175
-But...
-We have to do this!

230
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,824
Help! I'll be defoliated!

Our village would certainly have been
destroyed without your protection.

238
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,755
Father, I was just offering the Jedi
our thanks.

239
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,216
Perhaps we do owe you thanks.

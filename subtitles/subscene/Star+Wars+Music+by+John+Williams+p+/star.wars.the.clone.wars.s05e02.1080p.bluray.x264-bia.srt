1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,437
Separatist takeover complete!

2
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:22,981
Another Republic planet has fallen.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,735
Onderon has seceded to the
Confederacy of Independent Systems

4
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,946
under the rule of a new king.

5
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:31,949
However, a small band of rebels
have taken refuge

6
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:35,160
deep within its vast and savage wilderness.

7
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,578
From an abandoned outpost,

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,249
they plot to take back the heavily fortified
capital city of Iziz

9
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,751
and end the Separatist occupation.

10
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:48,924
Unfortunately, the only way
to reclaim Onderon

11
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,592
will be through armed struggle.

12
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,178
But we lack
sufficient hardware and supplies.

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,432
Onderon is in your king's rule,
and at the outbreak of the Clone War,

14
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,810
he chose to align it with the Separatists.

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,770
Our true king has been silenced.

16
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:05,816
The one you recognize
is a traitor and a Separatist minion.

17
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,734
We need your help to survive this.

18
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:11,321
Find a way we shall.

19
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,699
We await your answer.

20
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,040
There are pockets of rebels on many
of these planets that just need guidance.

21
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,211
With training and resources,
they could attack soft targets

22
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,173
while the Republic continues
to engage them on the battlefield.

23
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,675
That sounds like terrorism, Anakin.

24
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,510
Well, I think of it as an insurgency.

25
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,388
To help realign these planets
with the Republic.

26
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,934
We can divide the Separatist forces
and press them on two fronts.

27
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,354
A means to an end fear cannot be.

28
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,275
Stop those who spread terror
the Jedi must.

29
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,696
Indeed. What you're suggesting
would open up dangerous possibilities.

30
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,865
We must not train terrorists.

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,408
Uh, rebels.

32
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,204
How we conduct war is
what distinguishes us from others.

33
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,539
Funding rebels to overthrow
a legitimate government

34
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,625
puts innocent lives at risk.

35
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:08,295
We can minimize collateral damage
by using arms that mainly affect droids.

36
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,215
The least we can do
is help them defend themselves.

37
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,383
Test the tactic while we're at it.

38
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,803
This could be a great new weapon for us.

39
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,142
Hmm.

40
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,394
Train and observe.

41
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,563
Send advisors we will.

42
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,232
I'll assemble a team.

43
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,484
I'm going with you.

44
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,319
What? You don't trust me?

45
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,155
Too much. That's what worries me.

46
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,756
This is Valkyrie 29-29.
We're coming up on the drop zone.

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,639
Go! Go! Go! Go!

48
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,041
We've spotted them, sir.

49
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,012
Stay where you are.

50
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,393
Identify yourselves.

51
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,065
It's all right. We're friends.

52
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,026
Jedi.

53
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:01,491
I'm Commander Tano. We're here
to help you take back your planet.

54
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,787
My name is Steela.
I'll guide you to our secret base.

55
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:14,064
Hmm?

56
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,901
Mmm.

57
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,404
A bit rough around the edges,
wouldn't you say?

58
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,573
That's why I brought Rex here.

59
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,660
They're not exactly what I would call shiny,
sir, but I can work with them.

60
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,266
- General Skywalker.
- At your service.

61
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:53,520
This is General Kenobi, Commander Tano
and Captain Rex.

62
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:57,357
We're looking forward to taking the fight
to those scrapping droids.

63
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,110
Yes, all in good time.

64
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,197
Saw. Saw Gerrera.

65
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,618
He fashions himself as our leader,
though no one elected him.

66
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,537
Well, for now, we're in charge.

67
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,581
And there is much to learn.

68
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,464
The Separatists have strength in numbers.

69
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,550
We're gonna show you
how to target and destroy them.

70
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,595
Now, to be clear,
we are not here to fight your war.

71
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,805
Rather, to show you how to conduct it

72
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,558
in the most efficient
and successful way possible.

73
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,396
Captain Rex.

74
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,150
I'll show you
how the 501st destroy clankers.

75
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:44,947
First, I need volunteers to carry supplies
from our entry point a half-click west.

76
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,908
- Shouldn't be a problem.
- Excellent.

77
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,664
Lux, it's good to see you again.

78
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,833
It's good to see you, too, Ahsoka.

79
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:59,294
I didn't realize you had
such strong ties to Onderon.

80
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,840
Onderon is my home.
My mother represented it in the Senate.

81
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:06,593
Your voice is strong. Like hers was.

82
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,138
Have you reconsidered
joining the Republic Senate?

83
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,976
Even if we do take back Onderon,
it won't change how I feel.

84
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,978
I'm not fighting for the Republic.

85
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,022
Well, what matters now
is we need each other's help.

86
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,816
Just like we did on Carlac.

87
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,653
Carlac? What happened on Carlac?

88
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,866
Ahsoka is the reason I'm here
and not with Death Watch.

89
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,202
- Really?
- What he means is...

90
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:34,705
She saved me from a huge mistake.

91
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,793
Hmm...

92
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,171
Lux obviously thinks highly of you.

93
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,380
I guess so.

94
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,674
Let's hope that respect is well founded.

95
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,182
The pilot in the front hatch
controls the tank, the shells

96
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,058
and the short-range blasters.

97
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,562
The commander in the top hatch
controls the turret and the main cannon.

98
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:03,150
You have to take out both chambers,
otherwise the tank will remain operational.

99
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,088
Everyone, divide up into teams of two, and
we'll practice an assault on both hatches.

100
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,091
I'll take the top.

101
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,927
Let's see what you're made of, Bonteri.

102
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,275
Sorry about that.

103
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,529
You're a terrible soldier, Bonteri.

104
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,909
I'm not sure if they're more interested
in fighting the droids or each other.

105
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,287
They'll learn.
We just need time to train them properly.

106
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,122
Keep your eyes on the quick learners.

107
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,959
- In this fight, time is not on our side.
- Come on! Hustle!

108
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,710
Go, go, go, go, go!

109
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,155
An unscheduled ship entered the
atmosphere in sector S-11

110
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,991
and failed to register.

111
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,743
The rebels may be operating in that area.

112
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,745
Check it out.

113
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,298
Come on, move it like a soldier!
Like a real soldier!

114
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,341
Come on, Donald! Pick it up, Hutch!

115
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,844
- You can do better than that.
- Come on, hustle!

116
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,679
I said hustle!

117
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:59,600
That's what I'm talking about right there.
Go, go, go! Good. Good!

118
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,518
- You sure you're up for this?
- Saw...

119
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,688
- It was an accident.
- You would have had us both killed.

120
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,816
Just stop it.

121
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,029
Sit down, boy, this isn't the Senate.

122
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,697
You've got no talent for this.

123
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,159
It's going to take a lot more than muscle
to defeat the Separatists.

124
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,495
Politics have failed us. We have no choice.

125
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,456
We always have a choice.

126
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,708
Then make yours.

127
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,212
Look, if we're going to succeed,
you'll need to be exceptional

128
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,214
with words and action.

129
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,382
There will be time for both.

130
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:42,976
Destroyers are quick, pack twin blasters
and come with their own shield generators.

131
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,812
Nothing short of a cannon will pierce it.

132
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,440
But they do have two weaknesses,

133
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,068
and you will need to work together
to exploit them.

134
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,241
The shields deflect high-velocity attacks.

135
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:06,083
What the shields don't stop are slow
or stationary objects.

136
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,628
They're designed to absorb them
so nothing hinders their movement.

137
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,721
Destroyers are blind from behind.

138
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,058
A distraction combined with a rear assault
will give you a kill.

139
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,395
The trick is to get the right speed
on the droid popper.

140
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:33,485
These are unarmed. Just concentrate
on getting it past the shield.

141
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,572
Watch and learn.

142
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,912
Quite brilliant.

143
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,800
Hmm. Nice touch.

144
00:11:57,301 --> 00:11:58,760
Thanks.

145
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,347
Not bad.

146
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:12,774
Ugh.

147
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:17,279
Be mindful of your frustration,
it will only hold you back.

148
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,656
Here, use your shoulder.

149
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,659
Let your arm swing,
and keep your eyes on the target.

150
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,789
Great.

151
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,666
Okay, let's get back to work.

152
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,461
Everyone pair up. We'll practice in groups.

153
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,261
Hey, Commander,
how about, uh, helping me practice?

154
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,031
Roger, roger. This is Command.

155
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:04,660
Copy that. I'll send a squad out now.

156
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,706
We've located the rebels.
Proceed to sector S-29.

157
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:11,458
Shoot to kill.

158
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,858
I can't get the distance or the speed right.

159
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:39,736
Don't give up. Learning this could save
your life and those around you.

160
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,407
A little backspin might help.

161
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,703
Just take it easy. Don't get frustrated.

162
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,297
- You got it.
- Good teacher, Jedi.

163
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,090
Oh!

164
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:02,634
Just forget it. I'll never learn this.

165
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,598
Uh, keep practicing.

166
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,529
- You made it look easy.
- Wasn't always that way.

167
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,074
Right, the Force. Is that your secret?

168
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,535
No, perseverance.

169
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,706
Look, you'll get the hang of it.
I wouldn't let it get you down.

170
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,750
I'm not feeling down.

171
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,045
I just know what I'm good at.

172
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,189
Impressive.

173
00:14:58,065 --> 00:14:59,858
Most impressive.

174
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:03,362
Fixed targets are one thing.
How about this?

175
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,082
Nice job.

176
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,380
You've clearly mastered
your ability to focus.

177
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,593
Snips, are you losing focus?

178
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:29,471
- No, Master.
- Good.

179
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,641
A head shot is the only decisive way
to disable a droid.

180
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:37,187
They don't need arms, legs, or even bodies
to pass intel to Central Command.

181
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,690
All right. Shoot at will.

182
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,945
Wait a minute, what is that?

183
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:48,282
Droids!

184
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:52,911
Take cover!

185
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,134
It appears the training is over.

186
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,606
I'll take the left flank if you take the right.

187
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:25,819
No, Anakin, we can only protect them.
We cannot fight this war for them.

188
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:31,658
There are too many.

189
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:35,454
But Anakin, Ahsoka and I can hold them off
while you get your people out of here.

190
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,750
You didn't teach us to run.

191
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,211
Saw, use your disrupters
to take out the droids.

192
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,587
I'm on it.

193
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,006
Ready, disrupters, on my mark.

194
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,592
Now!

195
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:51,386
What is that?

196
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,973
- It looks like an explosive.
- How can you tell?

197
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:59,394
- Not bad.
- That is only the first wave.

198
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,493
- We'll handle this.
- No, I will.

199
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:16,370
Duck!

200
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:39,309
Hey, Bonteri, you ready to try again?

201
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,523
- Hey! What are you doing?
- What you taught us!

202
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,907
Surrender, rebel.

203
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:58,245
You will answer for your crimes
against the Separatist Alliance...

204
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,928
We, uh, need to clean you up.

205
00:18:15,387 --> 00:18:19,558
I like it. Now you look more like
a soldier than a politician.

206
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,978
Well, maybe a good politician
needs to get dirty now and then.

207
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,988
Take confidence from this victory.

208
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,241
But rest assured,
there will be more droids coming

209
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,327
now that they know your position.

210
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,662
It doesn't matter, you're ready now.

211
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,332
We are going to take the fight to the droids.

212
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,834
You don't have to hide in the jungle
any longer.

213
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:49,296
Droids were a bit dim.
More so than I imagined.

214
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,841
They make up for it in numbers.
They're designed to overwhelm.

215
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,094
But they're not designed
to deal with our approach.

216
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,347
We hit them where they least expect it.

217
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,765
And before they realize what happened...

218
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,100
We fade in with the rest of the population.

219
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,685
Exactly.

220
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,605
We need a plan to get inside the city.

221
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,066
I have an idea.

222
00:19:33,674 --> 00:19:36,009
Identification, please.

223
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,433
Halt!

224
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,645
What were you doing
outside of the city gates?

225
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,731
Hunting. We've been trekking for days.

226
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,027
Did you register before your excursion?

227
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:58,782
No, but most of our time is spent
in the bush collecting our traps.

228
00:19:58,866 --> 00:20:00,492
We come to the city to sell.

229
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:04,204
You can't get thrip larvae like this in Iziz.

230
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,040
Only the biggest trees
on the other side of Onderon.

231
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,502
Hey, listen, we need to deliver
all of this in time for supper.

232
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,254
Hmm.

233
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,839
Are you scanning anything?

234
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:17,634
It's hard to tell
with so much organic matter.

235
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:21,138
Come on!
Our merchants are waiting inside.

236
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,806
Can you hurry it up?

237
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,351
- Let them through.
- Roger, roger.

238
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:37,654
Good plan.

239
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,616
Like Saw said,
those droids are dumber than we thought.

240
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:53,545
Not a bad start.
But now the hard work begins.

241
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:56,715
You must find recruits
and choose your targets wisely.

242
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,884
They'll be looking for us.

243
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,469
We should split up.

244
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,263
Regroup after nightfall.
I'll alert our brothers.

245
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,770
We'll make sure you have
the supplies you need.

246
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,730
Rex and I will take care of that.

247
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,398
Good luck.

248
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,942
You, too.

249
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,290
How do you think they'll do?

250
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,294
I have a feeling
we'll be pleasantly surprised.

251
00:21:34,795 --> 00:21:37,381
So you admit our new strategy will work.

252
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,675
I am hopeful, Anakin.

253
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:41,552
Hopeful.

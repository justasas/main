1
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,560
Young people from all over the globe...

2
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,730
are joining up
to fight for the future.

3
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,690
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part.

4
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,360
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part too.

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,450
They're doing their part,
are you?

6
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,040
Join the Mobile Infantry
and save the world.

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,620
Service guarantees citizenship.

8
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,590
The bugs send
another meteor our way...

9
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,510
but this time we're ready.

10
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,010
Planetary defences
are better than ever.

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,230
Klendathu, source
of the bug meteor attacks...

12
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,770
orbits a twin star system whose
brutal gravitational forces...

13
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,860
produce an unlimited supply
of bug meteorites...

14
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,610
in the form
of this asteroid belt.

15
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,900
To ensure the safety
of our solar system...

16
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,490
Klendathu must be eliminated.

17
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,790
We break net now and take you
live to Klendathu...

18
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,620
where the invasion has begun.

19
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,130
EXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,811
- We've just landed here on what cap troopers...
- Move, move, move!

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,920
...are calling Big K,
- Come on! Move, move!

22
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,590
...with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!
- Come on!

23
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,970
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet!

24
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,760
A planet hostile to life
as we know it!

25
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,600
Help me!

26
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,450
- Come on! Go, go, go!
- Keep moving!

27
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,160
Get out of here now!

28
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,130
Kitten, no!

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,100
Oh, God!

30
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,310
Oh, God!

31
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,200
Rico. Rico. Rico!

32
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,420
Pay attention.

33
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,210
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,340
Let's sum up.

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,220
This year we explored
the failure of democracy...

36
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,090
- Bad boy... how the social
scientists brought our world...

37
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,970
to the brink of chaos.

38
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,850
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control...

39
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,230
and imposed the stability
that has lasted for generations since.

40
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,110
You know these facts...

41
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,480
but have I taught you anything
of value this year?

42
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,150
Hmm?

43
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,190
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,780
It's a reward,

45
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,620
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

46
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,830
No. No.

47
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,460
Something given has no value.

48
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,790
Look, when you vote, you are
exercising political authority.

49
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,840
You're using force. And force,
my friends, is violence,

50
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,800
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,970
Uh, my mother always said
violence never solves anything.

52
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,550
Really?

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,060
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,980
You.

55
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,940
They probably wouldn't say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed.

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,400
Correct.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,610
Naked force has resolved
more issues...

58
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,280
throughout history
than any other factor.

59
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,780
The contrary opinion, that
violence never solves anything,

60
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,200
is wishful thinking
at its worst.

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,450
People who forget that
always pay.

62
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,120
Rico, what's the moral
difference, if any...

63
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,170
between a civilian
and a citizen?

64
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,250
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety...

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,630
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,850
- A civilian does not.
- The exact words of the text.

67
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,720
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?

68
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,980
- I don't know.
- Of course you don't.

69
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,100
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue...

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,020
if it reached up
and bit you in the ass.

71
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,920
Not here.

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,130
Come on, let's see if they
posted the math final.

73
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,470
- Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
- We're gonna kill 'em.

74
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,140
Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,600
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your math scores.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,100
Wish me luck.

77
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,490
- Way to go.
- Good job.

78
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,780
Your turn.
Hold on.

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,410
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

80
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,330
- Marco.
- Hi, Carmen.

81
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,910
- What do you hear about Roxy?
- She made pilot.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
- She did?
- Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,540
Thirty-five percent.
Very nice.

84
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,970
Look at that. Thirty-five
percent, ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,340
Big numbers.

86
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,340
- Carl.
- Sorry.

87
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,850
So, you haven't done it yet,
have you? Don't lie.

88
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,690
I'm not in any hurry.

89
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,900
- Others are waiting.
- And?

90
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,200
- Did you read her mind?
- Don't have to.

91
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,490
It's pretty clear
what she wants.

92
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,990
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

93
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,240
- Aw, you got it bad.
- Bye, Marco.

94
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,750
Hey, don't forget about
this afternoon.

95
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,460
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Get out of here.

97
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,800
- Marco's sister made pilot.
- So will you.

98
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,050
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

99
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:43,760
You gotta have nerves of steel.

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,390
Yeah, you do. Let's see
how yours hold up.

101
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,640
You may begin.

102
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,740
Aw, come on, it's just a bug.
You better put your goggles on.

103
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,280
"Just a bug."

104
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,410
We humans like to think we are
nature's finest achievement.

105
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,700
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

106
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,290
This Arkellian sand beetle
is superior in many ways.

107
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,090
It reproduces in vast
numbers, has no ego...

108
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,220
has no fear, doesn't
now about death...

109
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,140
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,720
But humans have created
art, mathematics...

111
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,470
and interstellar travel.

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,560
True. But before you
let that go to your head...

113
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,940
take the example
of the Arachnids...

114
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,320
a highly evolved
insect society.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,400
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid...

116
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,530
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years...

117
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,080
- and now...
- Here, take this.

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,580
...they can
colonize planets...

119
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,620
by hurling their spore
into space.

120
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,920
Okay, I think we got it.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,380
That's the heart.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,760
And here's the stomach.

123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,430
Nerves of steel, huh?

124
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,650
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

125
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,520
Try to visualize it.

126
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,410
I see the ace of spades.

127
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,050
You know,
statistically speaking,

128
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,960
you should have accidentally
guessed right by now.

129
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,840
- Try another.
- So my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky.

130
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,010
No, luck's not a factor.

131
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,970
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

132
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,140
Who knows? Maybe it's a new
stage of human evolution.

133
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,110
That's why they do these
kind of Federal studies.

134
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,190
What... Cyrano...
Oh, shit. Time out.

135
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,690
Oh, he just wants
some attention.

136
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,400
You don't play
with him any more.

137
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,660
Cyrano.

138
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,910
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

139
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,550
How do you make him do that?

140
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,050
Oh, I gave him the impression
there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

141
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,840
He's on a mission to go eat it.

142
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:37,600
Ow! Oh! Get out!
Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

143
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,770
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

144
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,860
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human. Yet.

145
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
Yeah!

146
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,160
All right!

147
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,090
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Touchdown Tigers.

148
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,590
And the score
is now 41-38.

149
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,760
Tigers lead
with 2...46 remaining...

150
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,010
here at the Buenos Aires
Sports Arena.

151
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,550
Time out Giants.

152
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,220
- Are you all right?
- Much better.

153
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,730
- Now. Good.
- Yeah!

154
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,350
All right!
Way to go, team!

155
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,190
Hey! Your helmet.

156
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,900
So, what are you doing
after the game?

157
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,650
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?

158
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,280
I don't know. It's my
last night as a civilian.

159
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,011
- Come on, number 12! Let's go!
- Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

160
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,750
- You're going to the Fleet Academy?
- Uh-huh.

161
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,250
That's where I want to go!

162
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,960
Come on, number 12!
Let's play ball!

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,750
Don't get any ideas
about my girlfriend!

164
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,640
All is fair in love and war.

165
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,890
- Giants! Giants!
- Johnny! Yeah!

166
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,260
Hut! Hut!

167
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,150
Hey, yeah!

168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,990
Giants leading 43-41.
Just over 42 seconds remaining.

169
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,080
- Yeah!
- All right, let's go.

170
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

171
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,210
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

172
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,670
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it? Hey, Rico?

173
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,130
- Hey!
- What?

174
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,800
You're drifting! Flip six,
three hole, on one! Got it?

175
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,140
- Just throw me the ball, Diz.
- Ready? Break!

176
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,520
Break!

177
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,310
Down. Set.
Tight left.

178
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,360
- Screen!
- Hut!

179
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,290
Yeah! Go, go, go!

180
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
All right!

181
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,800
Yeah!

182
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,380
He's in there.
It's over.

183
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,820
Who said you could
grow up so fast, huh?

184
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,950
Mom, don't get mushy.

185
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,870
This came for you today.

186
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,870
I presume, at your request.

187
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,750
A lot of my friends are
doing Federal Service.

188
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,290
Well, you're not
thinking of applying?

189
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,420
Have you lost your mind?

190
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,670
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.

191
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,010
It's a term of service.

192
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,010
It's not a career.

193
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,260
I just want to get
out on my own...

194
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,180
see the galaxy
for a couple years.

195
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,690
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

196
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,480
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?

197
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,530
What's his name? You know
the one I'm talking about.

198
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,740
- Mr Rasczak.
- Rasczak?

199
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,040
Silly name. There should
be a law against...

200
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,290
using a school
as a recruiting station.

201
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,790
No, Rasczak doesn't do that
at all.

202
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,920
He sort of discourages you.

203
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
Well, that's good.

204
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,920
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

205
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,510
It's my decision, not yours.

206
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,260
- Oh, is that how it is, huh?
- Wait, you two.

207
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,770
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.

208
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,350
Can you guess what it is?

209
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,770
No.

210
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,650
You wanted to see the galaxy?

211
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,940
How about a trip
to the Outer Rings?

212
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,950
Zegema Beach. Huh?

213
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,080
I've always wanted to go there.

214
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,700
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.

215
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,020
Sure. Don't go away.

216
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,020
I'm just gonna
go see Mr Rasczak.

217
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,150
Hey, Rico, do you
want to dance?

218
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,810
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen...

219
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
Aw, come on. Too bad for her
if she's not around.

220
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:44,360
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...

221
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,330
probably won't
see each other again.

222
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,000
So, you still
gonna play for Rio?

223
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

224
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,800
Well, anyone
who gets you is lucky.

225
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,880
Johnny, how come
we never got together?

226
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,850
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

227
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,940
Sure.

228
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,520
- Thank you.
- Good night.

229
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,320
Look, Diz, I want to talk
to Mr Rasczak.

230
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,160
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

231
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,620
You're the best.

232
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,380
Mr Rasczak!

233
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,430
- What is it, Rico?
- I want to thank you.

234
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,050
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

235
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,720
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

236
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,560
Well, I want to join up.

237
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,560
I think I got what it takes
to be a citizen.

238
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,060
Good for you.
Go find out.

239
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,020
Well, my parents
are against it.

240
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,730
And I know it's my choice.

241
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,610
I was wondering...

242
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,950
what would you do
if you were me?

243
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,471
Figuring things out
for yourself...

244
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,740
is the only freedom
anyone really has.

245
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,290
Use that freedom.

246
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,580
Make up your own mind, Rico.

247
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,130
But I have not been to paradise

248
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,340
No, I have not been to paradise

249
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,270
Watch the days go by

250
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,230
All is fine

251
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,940
Don't exaggerate.

252
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,020
I'm serious. I think you have
really beautiful eyes.

253
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,900
- You know?
- Johnny.

254
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:46,740
Uh, this is Zander.

255
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,620
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

256
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,580
- No hard feelings?
- No, none at all. We won.

257
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,460
Come on, Carmen.
It's the last dance.

258
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the Academy.

259
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,960
Yeah. Who knows?

260
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,680
- Good luck.
- Zander's going for pilot too.

261
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,600
You two have so much in common.

262
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,810
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

263
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,560
Well, maybe.

264
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,770
You don't have to be jealous.

265
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,740
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

266
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,280
There's a place
for that sort of thing.

267
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,080
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

268
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,040
I'm gonna go
for Federal Service.

269
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,420
That's great.

270
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,420
Carl and I are signing up
tomorrow. Come with us.

271
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,840
I will.

272
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,850
My father's not home tonight.

273
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,640
All is well

274
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,520
All is well

275
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,980
Talk about it

276
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,570
Watch the days go by

277
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,910
All is well

278
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,160
24th century dies

279
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,870
I do now,
of my own free will...

280
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,370
after having been
duly advised and warned...

281
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,710
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath...

282
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
enrol in the Federal Service...

283
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,340
for not less than two years...

284
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,550
and as much longer
as may be required...

285
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,760
by the needs of the Federation.

286
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,970
- All set?
- Thank you.

287
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,940
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh?

288
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,240
- So, how'd you kids do?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.

289
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,360
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.

290
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,950
- Hey, did you get starside R and D?
- No.

291
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,540
- I don't believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.

292
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,670
Games and Theory?

293
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,290
- That's military intelligence.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,670
Way to go, Carl.

295
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,470
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

296
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,010
Hmm.

297
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,260
How about you, son?

298
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,310
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.

299
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,940
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

300
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,320
All recruits must report to the
Federal Transportation Hub...

301
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,030
within 24 hours.

302
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,740
Welcome to the adventure
of Federal Service.

303
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,110
Let's make a vow.

304
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,620
No matter what,
we'll always be friends.

305
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,540
I'll go for that.

306
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,540
Well, chances are we'll
never see each other again.

307
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,420
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

308
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,970
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

309
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,430
You'll resign, and that's
all there is to it.

310
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,430
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

311
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,430
- I won't quit!
- I'm telling you, you will.

312
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,560
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

313
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,560
I am not going on vacation!

314
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,480
I want to be a citizen.

315
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,020
It's my decision.
I made it.

316
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,990
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

317
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,700
You understand me?

318
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,160
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!

319
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?

320
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,410
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?

321
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,410
Well, yeah, sure.

322
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,370
Well, I hope so.

323
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,040
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl...

324
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,090
who wants to look handsome
in a uniform.

325
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,460
- Don't talk about Carmen that way!
- Johnny.

326
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,470
Your attention, please.

327
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,850
Outbound group 1380,
all hub 29 connections.

328
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,600
- Do you have everything?
- Moscow now boarding...

329
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,600
- Great.
...at bank 8-A.

330
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,480
- Johnny.
- Be a good girl, hear?

331
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,320
- You're late.
- My dad had to help me pack.

332
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,160
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

333
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,700
It was sweet,
but it took forever.

334
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,540
Oh. Anyway, I guess
I'm ready to go.

335
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,670
Yeah, me too. I'm wearing
everything I own.

336
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,380
I'm sorry your parents
were mad.

337
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,880
Who cares? The Federation
will give me...

338
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,260
everything I need for
the next two years, right?

339
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,560
- You talk to Carl?
- Yeah, he left this morning.

340
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,520
- Couldn't say where.
- Oh, it's exciting, going away.

341
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,400
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

342
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,240
I'm gonna miss you.

343
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,910
I'm gonna miss you too.

344
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,910
I love you.

345
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,120
Outbound group 94B
to Tereshkova...

346
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,910
That's me.

347
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,250
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

348
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,340
I love you.

349
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,060
Don't forget to write.

350
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,520
I won't.

351
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,370
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?

352
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,750
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

353
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:36,130
Citizen rule. People
making a better tomorrow.

354
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,430
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.

355
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,430
Guilty.

356
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,440
Sentence... death.

357
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,730
Execution tonight at 6...00.
All net. All channels.

358
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,830
If you think you're psychic,

359
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,080
maybe you are.

360
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,420
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.

361
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,840
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.

362
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:29,430
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...

363
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,770
and established Fort Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

364
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,020
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists...

365
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,980
Arachnids.

366
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,990
- One, two, three, four!
- Ten-hut!

367
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,120
- One, two, three, four!
- Most of you will not...

368
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,910
live to be
in the Mobile Infantry.

369
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,670
The trouble is, you are not
good enough the way you are.

370
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,880
Hands at your side!

371
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,340
Chin up.

372
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,220
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!

373
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,140
Suck in that gut!
Feet together!

374
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,270
To think this had
to happen to me.

375
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,770
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!

376
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,140
You don't rate that good.

377
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,310
Never in my life have I seen...

378
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,280
Do you think I'm funny?
Do I make you laugh?

379
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,030
- Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
- I'm sorry.

380
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,240
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be "Sir"!

381
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,450
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

382
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,000
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

383
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,370
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

384
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,460
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move! Move!

385
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,040
Now, anytime you think
I'm being too tough...

386
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:43,050
anytime you think
I'm being unfair...

387
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,630
anytime you miss
your mommy, quit!

388
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,090
You sign form 1240-A,
you grab your gear...

389
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,760
you take a stroll
down Washout Lane!

390
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,560
Do you get me?

391
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,890
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Pathetic!

392
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,270
I wonder if there's a handful of
guts in the whole bunch of you.

393
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:05,400
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

394
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,280
Sir! I guess
maybe I do, sir!

395
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,380
Ow! God! God!

396
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,710
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!

397
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,050
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.

398
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,050
- Medic!
- God.

399
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,060
Pain is in your mind!

400
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,020
- Who's next?
- Sir!

401
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,980
Recruit Flores reporting
for duty, sir!

402
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,990
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

403
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,790
Sir, I heard
it was the best, sir!

404
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,960
It is the best.

405
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,000
But what makes you think
you're good enough?

406
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,970
Now that's the kind of gal
who makes squad leader.

407
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,260
That's my job
you're talking about.

408
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,310
Come on.

409
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,680
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

410
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,020
- Roughnecks!
- Roughnecks!

411
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,430
- On the go!
- On the go!

412
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,870
One, two, three, four...

413
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,200
one, two, MI!

414
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,250
You know, I'd like
to kill that Sergeant Zim.

415
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,790
- Whoa, improper attitude!
- Watch it.

416
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,081
- They'll kick you out for talking like that.
- Bye-bye.

417
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,170
There you go down Washout Lane.

418
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,670
Yup, you either got what
it takes, or you don't.

419
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,010
- Hey, there is a line.
- Wait your turn, Ace.

420
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,760
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

421
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,430
Get in line like everyone else.

422
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:11,450
You got some guts
for a rich kid.

423
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:13,990
I guess you and me could be
buddies. What do you say?

424
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,570
Oh-oh, that is
no way to act.

425
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,830
- I'm honoured.
- Hey! Of course you are.

426
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,040
Everybody should have
a friend like me.

427
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,330
Come on, Ace. Back of the line
now! Back of the line!

428
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,710
- Back, back, back, back!
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up.

429
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,420
- What a jerk, man.
- Tough guy.

430
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,510
Hey, Rico, want
to sit together?

431
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,970
No thanks, Diz.

432
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,180
What's your malfunction, Rico?

433
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
You are.

434
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,430
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

435
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,940
You think I joined the Mobile
Infantry because of you?

436
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,900
You saying you didn't?

437
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,620
Hi.

438
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,240
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

439
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,250
What makes you even think you're
gonna make squad leader, Rico?

440
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,960
- Something I got, you don't.
- Ha!

441
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,880
- You rich kids are all the same.
- It isn't about that.

442
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,090
- It's about who's the best.
- Hey!

443
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,930
Third squad!

444
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,480
If someone's hurt, put him on your back
and take him out of there!

445
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,730
Let's go!

446
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,610
Go, Simmons!
Go, go, you sissy!

447
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,690
Sir, I don't understand.

448
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,990
Who needs a knife
in a nuke fight, anyway?

449
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:37,780
All you gotta do
is push a button, sir.

450
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,240
Cease fire. Put your hand
on that wall, trooper.

451
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,830
Put your hand on that wall!

452
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,010
Damn it.

453
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:08,190
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

454
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,150
Medic!

455
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,900
Hand me that towel, will you?

456
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:18,490
Ah, well, we all have
one thing in common.

457
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,530
We were all stupid enough
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

458
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,700
- Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
- Oh, my family's all farmers.

459
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,660
I hate farming. I mean,
uh, Mobile Infantry...

460
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,670
It's like pure picnic
by comparison.

461
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,210
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?

462
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,670
- And pretty!
- I like big!

463
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,720
- Djana, what about you?
- Oh, I'm going in for politics...

464
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
and, you know, you gotta be
a citizen for that.

465
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,060
- So here I am.
- Ah, you want some responsibility.

466
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,390
- Yeah.
- Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.

467
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,850
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.

468
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,230
It's gonna cost an arm
and a leg, you know?

469
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,020
So, if I serve,

470
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,730
Federation pays my way.

471
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,240
I want to have babies.

472
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,610
You know, it's a lot easier to
get a license if you've served.

473
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,410
- So...
- I'm going career.

474
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:03,200
- Officer's training. All the way.
- Ah!

475
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,580
Future Sky Marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.

476
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,580
Who asked you to be so nosy?

477
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,710
What? I'm the-the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

478
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,590
A writer's got
a right to be nosy.

479
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,460
Hey, Flores, you know
Rico from Buenos Aires.

480
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,760
- What's his story?
- Oh, uh,

481
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
he's here because of a girl.

482
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,180
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

483
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,600
- He's getting me excited.
- He's gonna blow.

484
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,320
Is it you?

485
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,080
This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.

486
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,870
Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.

487
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,960
Boot's pretty tough.

488
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,670
Sometimes I think I won't make it.

489
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,050
But then I think about what
you're doing, and I try harder.

490
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,260
- Hey, guys! Do you mind?
- Try harder, baby, try harder!

491
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,810
Who knows? They might even
make me squad leader.

492
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,610
Uh-oh,
I better pack it in.

493
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,320
Oh, I love you, baby,
I love you!

494
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,070
- Write me!
- I love you so much

495
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,870
- I'm gonna kill you guys!
- I love you so much

496
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,950
- Bye! Write me.
- Bye!

497
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,870
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

498
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,790
First one there gets to fly.

499
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,640
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!

500
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:57,520
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.
She's crazy!

501
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,650
Ready, go!

502
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,570
Yeah!

503
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,910
Deploying wings.

504
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,370
How come you're
in such a good mood, huh?

505
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,290
'Cause today I get to fly that.

506
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,150
Pilot Trainee Ibanez
reporting for duty, ma'am.

507
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,070
Take the number two chair,
Ibanez.

508
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,410
- Yes, ma'am.
- You see that?

509
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:38,000
- Identify.
- Ibanez, T-325-A, clear.

510
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,130
What are you doing here?

511
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,090
I'm the guy whose gonna
teach you to fly this crate.

512
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,970
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

513
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,520
Should I call you " sir"?

514
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,600
- Only when I give you an order.
- Prepare for departure.

515
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,690
It's amazing, us running
into each other like this.

516
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,530
- Maybe it's fate.
- Maybe not.

517
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,780
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

518
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:14,490
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick, but a natural.

519
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,040
And when it turned out
to be you,

520
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,330
I just made sure that we
would run into each other.

521
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:21,130
Rodger Young cleared for
undocking and departure.

522
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,000
All right, Ibanez.

523
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,420
- Take her out.
- Yes, ma'am.

524
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,630
All systems go.

525
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:56,200
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.

526
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,080
Well, this isn't simulation any more...

527
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,790
so take her out easy, cadet.

528
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,120
Yes, sir.

529
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,760
Five metres from object.

530
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,470
Three metres from object.

531
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,560
Clear.

532
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,530
- Don't exceed port speed.
- Or what?

533
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,320
Or they revoke your flight
status, and mine.

534
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,450
Your career is in my hands.

535
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,000
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

536
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,300
- Prepare for warp.
- Yes, ma'am.

537
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,670
Number One, design
for Jupiter orbit.

538
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,600
All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.

539
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,430
- Star drive in five, four,
- Five, four...

540
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,810
- ready... three, two...
- Steady...

541
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,440
- one...
- Go!

542
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,250
We're going in!
Move!

543
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,760
Man, they're defended.
No way in.

544
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,600
- Flip six, three hole.
- What?

545
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,440
You run a flip six, three
hole play, and you can score.

546
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,900
- Cover me.
- You got it.

547
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,990
Now!

548
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,040
- Thanks, buddy.
- Bastard!

549
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,600
Yeah!

550
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:27,270
Kid's got some moves.

551
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,230
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.

552
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,030
Kitty, Kitty.

553
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,570
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

554
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,280
Look at him.

555
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,120
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

556
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,870
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brownnose.

557
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,290
All right, where were we?

558
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,250
Okay, watch and learn.
Watch and learn.

559
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,800
I couldn't have done it
without you, Diz.

560
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,050
Friends?

561
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,310
Friends.

562
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,100
- Mail call! Levy!
- Yeah, that's me.

563
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,770
- Shujimi!
- Here.

564
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,310
- Rico.
- Here.

565
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,440
- Breckinridge!
- Yeah, right here.

566
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,610
- Niler.
- Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.

567
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,700
That's all, folks.

568
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,660
Hi, Johnny.

569
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,290
I'm sorry I haven't
written you sooner, but, uh...

570
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,960
- Oh, Rico, - it's been really busy.
- You don't deserve that!

571
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,050
- Shh, shh.
- They've really got us going here.

572
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,670
They must have made you
squad leader by now.

573
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,130
And if they haven't,
tell 'em to talk to me.

574
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,470
See? All it takes is
the love of a good woman.

575
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,970
- Yeah. - That is a woman.
- Beautiful.

576
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,850
- Look at that.
- Look at those. - Stop it.

577
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:49,810
- Isn't it beautiful?
- I'm dying.

578
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,060
I love it out here.

579
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,900
- That's also the problem.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

580
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,200
Because I think
I'm gonna go career.

581
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,910
I want to command
a ship of my own.

582
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,870
And you know...

583
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,040
I don't think that's gonna
leave a lot of room...

584
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,170
for you and me, Johnny.

585
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,590
- Oh, God.
- Jeez.

586
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,170
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

587
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,550
But, uh...

588
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,100
I have to follow my heart.
I'm sorry.

589
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,190
Write me, all right?

590
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,860
Write me so that I know
we'll always be friends.

591
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,250
- Let's get back to the game.
- I feel so sorry for Johnny.

592
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,670
Funny how they always
want to be friends...

593
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,590
after they rip your guts
out, huh?

594
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,460
Yeah. Well,
it's what I deserve.

595
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
What are you talking about?

596
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,600
Oh, I joined up for her.

597
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,180
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

598
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,100
What are you talking about? You
made squad leader on your own.

599
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,440
And, hey, you still got me
to kick around.

600
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,610
Fun and games are over,
children.

601
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,740
You will be firing
live ammunition...

602
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,040
in a simulated combat
environment.

603
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,540
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

604
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,380
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

605
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,250
Rico, take 'em out!

606
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,920
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

607
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,840
Maximum score has been 280.

608
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:50,850
- I expect you to do better!
- Go!

609
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,770
Shujimi, stay down!

610
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,200
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

611
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:15,290
It's my helmet!
It's all screwed up!

612
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,080
You're gonna blow the score!

613
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,750
- Damn!
- Dumb shit!

614
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,250
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?

615
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,130
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
- Give it to me.

616
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:24,510
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

617
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,010
It must be 'cause
I'm big and dumb!

618
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,720
Yeah, right!

619
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,640
Medic!

620
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,020
Rico, you are relieved
of squad command!

621
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,110
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?

622
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,070
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge
reported a helmet malfunction...

623
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,780
and I asked him
to show it to me, sir.

624
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,620
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

625
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:58,790
Sir, no, sir!

626
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,750
Then why did you order your man
to remove his helmet...

627
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,420
during a live fire exercise?

628
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,720
Sir, I needed everyone in
my squad operational, sir!

629
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,680
I wanted to win, sir!

630
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,980
Carry on.

631
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,030
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

632
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,200
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

633
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,370
Yes, sir, I do.

634
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,040
All right.

635
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,380
We'll try administrative punishment.

636
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,130
Prisoner, halt!

637
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,860
Bite down on this, son.

638
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,530
It helps.
I know.

639
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,880
For incompetence of command...

640
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,630
for failure to abide
by safety regulations...

641
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:32,130
during a live fire exercise...

642
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,890
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...

643
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,180
recruit trainee John Rico...

644
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,350
is sentenced to
administrative punishment.

645
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:43,230
Ten lashes.

646
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,110
You may carry out the sentence.

647
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,490
One!

648
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:00,080
Two!

649
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,250
Three!

650
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,130
Four!

651
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:10,800
Five!

652
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,430
Six!

653
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,510
Seven!

654
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:21,890
Eight!

655
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,350
Nine!

656
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,400
Ten!

657
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,750
All sections secure.
EBS is high normal.

658
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,790
Switching to slave on my mark.
Mark.

659
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,590
Thanks.
You read my mind.

660
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,510
Oh, third watch always
seems to last forever.

661
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,260
I don't know.

662
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:59,850
It depends on who
you're spending it with.

663
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,430
Something's wrong.

664
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:12,940
- There.
- No, I replotted the course.

665
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,200
- It's more efficient this way.
- Three weeks aboard a starship...

666
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,490
and you think that you
can lick my navs?

667
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,870
Check it.

668
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,130
You know, I was talking
with Captain Deladier...

669
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,670
and, uh, she said...

670
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,300
Don't change the subject.

671
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,670
Am I right?

672
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:44,100
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.

673
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,480
So, what did the captain say?

674
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,690
She thinks that we ought
to team up officially...

675
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,530
and crew for her.

676
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:59,110
- You and me, huh?
- We're good together, Carmen.

677
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,530
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

678
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,620
I can anticipate you.

679
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,460
You know what I want.

680
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,380
No. What do you want?

681
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,010
There's a gravity field
out there.

682
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,640
- Run a scan. Sensors on.
- There.

683
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,570
- Gravity at 225 and rising.
- Report.

684
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,610
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object...

685
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:37,400
moving toward us at high speed.

686
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,780
Profile suggests
an asteroid, ma'am.

687
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,750
- Impact, six seconds!
- Emergency evasion!

688
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,220
Three, two,

689
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,600
fire!

690
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,240
Close compartment 21!

691
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,840
Where'd it come from?

692
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,760
It came out of the Arachnid
Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

693
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,640
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell 'em
there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

694
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,850
Communications are down,
ma'am. They're gone.

695
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,480
- Damage assessment.
- Hull's compromised.

696
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,060
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

697
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,020
Luck didn't have anything
to do with it.

698
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,150
We have a hell
of a flight team.

699
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,960
It really stinks, you going.

700
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,880
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry
will just have to get along without me.

701
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,930
I don't get it, Rico.
You took your licks.

702
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,640
If they didn't want you,
they would have kicked you out.

703
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,140
Hey...

704
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,720
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.

705
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,060
I figure that kind of proves
I don't have what it takes.

706
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,690
Rico, your call's going through.

707
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,690
Take it there.

708
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:53,080
- Hello? Oh, Johnny!
- Hi, Mom.

709
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,210
B-Bill, pick it up.
It's Johnny!

710
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,080
- Johnny?
- Dad.

711
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,540
- Where's your uniform?
- Bill.

712
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,260
It's just good
to hear from you.

713
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,680
How are you, son?

714
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,970
It's not really working out
here for me, Dad.

715
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,600
I was thinking...

716
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,600
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

717
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,680
Well, of-of course. You should
come home immediately.

718
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,350
I'm sorry.
I've been an idiot.

719
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,770
Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...

720
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:21,020
talk things out.

721
00:49:22,610 --> 00:49:23,990
We love you, son.

722
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:28,030
- My, what's that?
- Looks like rain.

723
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,830
- This time of year?
- Sure is dark.

724
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,620
Your transmission
has been terminated...

725
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:35,250
due to atmospheric
interference.

726
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,790
Please try your call
again later.

727
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,340
Sanchez!

728
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,090
Well, see ya.

729
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,590
Hey, you take that stroll
down Washout Lane...

730
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,470
you're only proving
one thing, Johnny.

731
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:51,930
What's that, Diz?

732
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,350
That you don't have what
it takes to be a citizen.

733
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,740
Mobile Infantry is passing by

734
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,740
Mobile Infantry is passing by

735
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,070
- Well, sound off
- Ml

736
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,410
- Sound off
- Passing by

737
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,450
- Count now
- One, two, three, four

738
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,910
- That's it! That's it!
- Left. Left.

739
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,790
- Left, right, left.
- Do you get me?

740
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,130
- Sir, yes, sir! - I can't hear you!
- What's going on, you guys?

741
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,550
Move, move, move!

742
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:28,720
What's happening?

743
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:35,810
Hey, hey, what's going on?

744
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,600
Wh-What's going on?

745
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:41,310
- Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
- It's war! We're going to war!

746
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,320
The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.

747
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,330
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.

748
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,450
Is that Geneva?

749
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,370
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

750
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,830
The meteor was shot out
of orbit by bug plasma...

751
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,340
that derived from Klendathu,
the Arachnids' home planet.

752
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:17,560
Nothing lives in what was once
called the Latin Paradise.

753
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,020
Oh, Johnny, it's us.

754
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,600
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.

755
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,940
That's home.

756
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,450
The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...

757
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,370
for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.

758
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:47,300
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

759
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:50,300
- I want combat, sir.
- The only way you're gonna see combat...

760
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,260
is if you bust yourself
to private!

761
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:55,390
- Get me?
- Yes, sir, I get you.

762
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,560
- Sir!
- What do you want, Rico?

763
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,690
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

764
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:03,850
You already signed
your 1240-A, son.

765
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,650
- It wouldn't be legal.
- Major, I know it was wrong.

766
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:10,490
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.

767
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,450
You made your decision, son.

768
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:17,200
Sir, my family, my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

769
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,250
Is this your signature, Rico?

770
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,960
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

771
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:32,420
Doesn't look like it to me.

772
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:39,100
- Carry on, Private!
- Yes, sir!

773
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:56,200
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow...

774
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:57,910
then anger.

775
00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:00,950
The only good bug
is a dead bug.

776
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,120
In Geneva,
the Federal Council convenes.

777
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,920
We must meet the threat
with our valour, our blood...

778
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,210
indeed, with our very lives...

779
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,880
to ensure that human civilization,
not insect...

780
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,850
dominates this galaxy,
now and always!

781
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,720
Sky Marshal Dienes
announces plans...

782
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:23,770
for an offensive
against Klendathu...

783
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:27,230
source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.

784
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:34,280
Every day, Federal scientists
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.

785
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,740
Your basic Arachnid warrior
isn't too smart...

786
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,160
but you can blow off a limb...

787
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,580
and it's still 86 percent
combat effective.

788
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,420
Here's a tip... Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.

789
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,300
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

790
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,930
- Die! Die!
- The war effort needs your effort...

791
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,310
at work, at home,
in your community.

792
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,940
We now break net and take you live...

793
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,320
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

794
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,940
deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

795
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:19,620
where the men and women of the Federal
Armed Services prepare to attack.

796
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,620
DXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

797
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,950
No one here in the AQZ
knows exactly...

798
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,290
when the invasion
of Klendathu will occur.

799
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:30,130
But everyone's
talking about it...

800
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,130
and the talk says tomorrow.

801
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,130
Here's a bunch of Ml kids that look
like they could eat bugs for lunch.

802
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,130
- Yum, yum, yum.
- So, trooper,

803
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:38,970
you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

804
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,720
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.

805
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,890
- Am I right?
- I just hope it's not over before we get some.

806
00:54:44,970 --> 00:54:46,810
- Okay, come on.
- Some say the bugs were provoked...

807
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,560
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat...

808
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,650
that a "live and let live policy"
is preferable to war with the bugs.

809
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,150
Let me tell you something.

810
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,320
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!

811
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,740
- Yeah!
- Go on, trooper! - Yeah!

812
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:00,240
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

813
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,240
Big bad bugs, huh?

814
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,410
Hey, guys,
we ought to get tattoos.

815
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:05,830
- Hey, let's all get cut together.
- Yeah.

816
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,250
- What do I want a tattoo for?
- Oh, what?

817
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,910
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.

818
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,330
Hey, Johnny!

819
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,000
Johnny Rico.

820
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:17,670
Carmen?

821
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,930
Oh. At ease.

822
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:26,060
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.

823
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:30,390
- Hi, Diz.
- Carmen.

824
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:35,270
My mother was right about you.

825
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,190
You look great in a uniform.

826
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,190
You look pretty good yourself.

827
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,990
So, what do you hear?

828
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,030
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?

829
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,700
Most of the time
I don't think about it.

830
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,410
Like it happened
to someone else.

831
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,710
Then it hits me,
and I, uh, can't stop crying.

832
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:58,550
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.

833
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,930
You don't look
very happy to see me.

834
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:04,390
Should I be?

835
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,220
Johnny, it's different now.
We're at war.

836
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:13,400
I mean, I think what I did was
probably the best thing for both of us.

837
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,650
Everything copacetic,
Lieutenant?

838
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,070
Zander, you remember Johnny.

839
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:21,400
Zander and I
are a flight team now.

840
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:23,240
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

841
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,330
I get it.

842
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:29,240
This is the part that's
best for both of us.

843
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,910
- Don't do me any more favours.
- Johnny, wait.

844
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,250
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.

845
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:36,250
See, when you're
trained to kill...

846
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,750
it just doesn't pay
to be polite.

847
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,090
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

848
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:44,050
I think you heard me.

849
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,180
You want to make
something of it, Private?

850
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,230
Not with an officer.
No, sir.

851
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:55,060
- The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers.
- Well, let's disregard rank.

852
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,400
- Zander, please.
- Let it go, Rico. - Let it go.

853
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,940
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.

854
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,030
- Don't do this.
- Come on. What's he gonna do?

855
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,500
Come on, jarheads!

856
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,420
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!

857
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:28,050
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

858
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,780
- Guys! Guys! Quit it!
- Come on! Come on!

859
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,220
- He's not worth it!
- Come on! - Come on!

860
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:33,020
- Let's get...
- Come on!

861
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,850
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry
and Fleet don't mix. Come on.

862
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,770
Come on, let's go.

863
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,280
Jarheads.

864
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,490
- Mobile Infantry rules!
- Yeah!

865
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,620
Oh, God, that hurts.

866
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,790
Hey, well, I got something that might
hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

867
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,840
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!

868
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,130
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

869
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,350
This is the captain speaking.

870
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,650
All personnel prepare for drop.

871
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:24,150
We are at D-minus three
and counting.

872
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:38,710
We are going in
with first wave.

873
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,920
Means more bugs for us to kill.

874
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,500
You smash the entire area.

875
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,670
You kill anything that has
more than two legs.

876
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,260
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!

877
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,140
- Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
- Bug batteries.

878
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:41,060
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

879
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:45,320
- Drop status?
- Drop is...

880
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,480
35 percent complete, ma'am.

881
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:54,410
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

882
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,590
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

883
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,360
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.

884
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,280
That's it.
We're empty, ma'am.

885
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:46,130
Someone made
a big goddam mistake!

886
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:55,050
Break for high orbit!

887
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,340
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

888
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,140
Johnny!

889
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,330
- Rockets up!
- Rocket crew, move up!

890
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,230
- Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico!
- Heat 'em up!

891
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:40,820
- Set.
- Fire!

892
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:42,740
Down!

893
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,830
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

894
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,920
First platoon, left flank!

895
01:02:56,010 --> 01:03:00,140
Split up! First and
second squads, follow me.

896
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:03,010
Two, cover!
One, with me!

897
01:03:03,930 --> 01:03:05,850
Along side! Side to side!

898
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:08,730
Fire!

899
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,960
Here they come!

900
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:34,800
- Ace, what are we doing?
- Uh, I don't know.

901
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:44,260
- I don't know.
- Kill them! Kill them all!

902
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,560
Come on!

903
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:57,610
Come on! Come on!
You want some?

904
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,610
Here's some! Yeah!

905
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,070
Here's some of this!

906
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,620
Oh, my God!

907
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,120
Shujimi!

908
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:12,250
No, no, no!

909
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,250
Help! Help! Help!

910
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:20,970
No! God!

911
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,470
Let's get out of here!

912
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:32,940
Fall back!

913
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,800
Mayday!

914
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,041
- All units, - What's going on?
- Fall back to retrieval.

915
01:05:02,050 --> 01:05:03,530
- Repeat.
- You got com? -All units...

916
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,300
- fall back to retrieval.
- It's a general retreat!

917
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,470
- Back to the boats!
- Come on!

918
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,890
Come on, let's go!

919
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:12,480
We've just landed here
on what cap troopers...

920
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,650
are calling Big K...

921
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:17,230
with the 6th Mobile
Infantry Division.

922
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:20,320
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet.

923
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,490
A planet hostile
to life as we...

924
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:29,490
Help me!

925
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,000
Squad right!

926
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,760
Come on! Go, go, go!

927
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,520
Get out of here now!

928
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:55,301
- Watch your step!
- Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

929
01:05:55,350 --> 01:05:57,190
GXR, we're being overrun.

930
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,370
Kitten, no!

931
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,900
Oh, God!

932
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,070
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

933
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:17,020
Crisis for humankind.

934
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:19,440
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...

935
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,940
the Arachnids'
defensive capability.

936
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:25,610
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...

937
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,280
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.

938
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:30,950
His successor,
Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...

939
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,620
outlines her new strategy.

940
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,620
To fight the bug...

941
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,120
we must understand the bug.

942
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:41,330
We can ill afford
another Klendathu.

943
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,920
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...

944
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,840
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.

945
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,010
When a colony reaches
a certain size...

946
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,800
300 generations or something,
it gets smarter.

947
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,260
- Insects with intelligence?
- Now, wait...

948
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,100
Have you ever met one?
I can't believe...

949
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,100
- I am hearing this nonsense.
- Would you just wait a moment?

950
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,220
- This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had.
- Maybe... Maybe...

951
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:05,940
there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet...

952
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,440
a leadership caste,
a-a hive brain.

953
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:13,200
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea
of a bug that thinks offensive!

954
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,880
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

955
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:32,800
Affirmative, Rodger Young.

956
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:35,680
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.

957
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:36,930
Welcome back.

958
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,560
My God.

959
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,560
How could this happen?

960
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,020
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.

961
01:09:04,330 --> 01:09:06,210
Give me something, please!

962
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,710
It hurts!

963
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:15,390
Be right with you.

964
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:19,220
Help me.

965
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:28,770
It's strange. There's
almost no wounded at all.

966
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,900
Bugs don't take prisoners.

967
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:41,370
Oh, no.

968
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,160
Look.

969
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:50,840
- Carmen...
- See it? Right there.

970
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:15,280
- There he is.
- Come on, we'll just wake him up.

971
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,780
Hey, Johnny! Hey!

972
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:22,790
- Hey, Rico!
- Hey, Johnny!

973
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:24,830
- Hey, Rico! - Wake up!
- How you doin', fish boy?

974
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:27,460
Hey, look.
You're dead!

975
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,840
Killed in action!

976
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:34,130
- Three more days.
- Three days.

977
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,220
- And you're out.
- Good as new. See you later.

978
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,630
Bye.

979
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,580
So what do you hear
about our new unit?

980
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,080
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

981
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:14,000
Yeah, well, I hear their
lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

982
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,680
Who's top kick?

983
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,850
You want the job, huh?

984
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:24,260
I wouldn't mind.

985
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:26,230
I would.

986
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,020
Just doing my part.

987
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,560
Orders.

988
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,610
Yours?

989
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:36,440
Where you been besides Big K?

990
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:40,410
- Outer rings, Zegema Beach.
- Zegema Beach?

991
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:42,870
- I always wanted to go there.
- Good luck.

992
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:48,040
- It's not there any more.
- So, I hear your lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

993
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,880
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

994
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,420
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.

995
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,680
- Same for me.
- Me too.

996
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:04,390
Well, sounds like
he's quite a guy.

997
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:06,140
Who do you think
saved your ass?

998
01:12:07,310 --> 01:12:10,770
Stand by.
Attention on deck!

999
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,240
This is for you new people.

1000
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:27,370
I only have one rule:

1001
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:30,830
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1002
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:33,920
You don't do your job,
I'll shoot you.

1003
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,250
Do you get me?

1004
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:37,340
We get you, sir!

1005
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,470
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rasczak's Roughnecks!

1006
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,800
At ease. Listen up.

1007
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:48,470
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.

1008
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,980
We're gonna clean out the
systems outlying Klendathu...

1009
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:53,230
one planet at a time.

1010
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,480
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

1011
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,990
After Fleet glasses
the planet, MI mops up.

1012
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:01,320
Carry on.

1013
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,160
All right.
Spread out!

1014
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,920
Fire teams! You locate
a bug hole, nuke it.

1015
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,680
Watkins, shake out
Flores and Rico.

1016
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,100
Copy that.
Move out!

1017
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:13,020
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.

1018
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:16,020
- Levy, you're with me.
- No, I'm in A Squad. I'm going with Rico.

1019
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:17,600
Shut up and follow me!

1020
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,850
Hey, you like that?

1021
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:59,940
Fungus-sucking sack
of maggot puke!

1022
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:01,610
It's dead, Watkins!
It's dead!

1023
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:09,021
Ain't much to look at after
you scrape them off your boot.

1024
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:13,290
Bug hole. There.

1025
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:29,220
Nuke 'em, Rico!

1026
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,680
Fire in the hole!

1027
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,820
Watkins, we're under
heavy attack. Position M-4.

1028
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:53,160
- Get over here!
- Move!

1029
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:06,260
- You got a bug problem, ma'am?
- Ah, stow it, trooper!

1030
01:16:27,820 --> 01:16:29,900
Tanker!

1031
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:33,070
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Move!

1032
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,710
Get down!

1033
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:53,050
Come on!

1034
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,460
Stay down, sucker!

1035
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,460
- Gillespie.
- Well done!

1036
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,130
Call for retrieval.

1037
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:10,300
- Medic!
- Nice moves.

1038
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:12,630
Where'd you learn how
to do that, soldier?

1039
01:18:12,710 --> 01:18:15,800
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

1040
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:19,890
- I was captain of the team.
- Rico?

1041
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:22,720
- Sir.
- I need a corporal.

1042
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:26,400
You're it until you're dead
or till I find somebody better.

1043
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:29,310
Thank you, sir.

1044
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,070
- All right, saddle up! Show's over.
- Way to go, Corporal.

1045
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:37,490
- Hey, I need a squad leader.
- Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it.

1046
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:38,990
I'm just here to fight.

1047
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,450
What about it, Diz?

1048
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,790
First sergeant,
get your gear in section...

1049
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,500
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

1050
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:53,050
- Catch you later.
- All right.

1051
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,930
Listen up!

1052
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,220
I expect the best,
and I give the best!

1053
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,400
Here's the beer!

1054
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:15,400
Here's the entertainment!

1055
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:21,910
Have fun!
That's an order!

1056
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:24,580
This one's for me!

1057
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,580
Thank you, Lieutenant!

1058
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:32,630
Rico!

1059
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:36,170
You kill bugs good.

1060
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:37,590
Thanks.

1061
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:41,760
You knew the lieutenant
before the war.

1062
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:43,760
What was he like?

1063
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:46,930
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

1064
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:49,100
He always had
this little smile.

1065
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:52,610
Yeah, well, he don't
smile much any more.

1066
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:56,440
Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up
real quick when your kids get smeared.

1067
01:19:56,530 --> 01:19:58,990
- Come on, Corporal.
- Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

1068
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:01,570
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

1069
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,080
Do I have to pull rank?

1070
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:07,410
Excuse me, sir.

1071
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:21,300
Rico. You once asked me
for advice. Want some now?

1072
01:20:21,390 --> 01:20:24,100
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

1073
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:28,600
Never pass up a good thing.

1074
01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:40,200
Watkins. Beer?

1075
01:20:52,370 --> 01:20:53,710
Ace.

1076
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,300
So, Rico, what are you
doing after the dance?

1077
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,310
What's so funny?

1078
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:58,020
You know, just the way
things work out.

1079
01:22:15,540 --> 01:22:18,040
We finally got together, Diz.

1080
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:22,710
I love you, Johnny.

1081
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:34,560
Rico!

1082
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:40,150
We're moving out. There's been a distress
call from General Owen on Planet P.

1083
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:42,400
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

1084
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,900
Yes, sir.

1085
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:45,490
Who's that with you?

1086
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,160
Flores, sir.

1087
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:54,410
Make it 20 minutes.

1088
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,660
Yes, sir.

1089
01:22:56,920 --> 01:22:58,250
Twenty minutes?

1090
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,750
We can do it.

1091
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,790
Whiskey Outpost, do you copy?

1092
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,920
This is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three. Come in, please.

1093
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:46,630
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost,

1094
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,970
this is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three.

1095
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:51,300
- Any contact with General Owen?
- No, sir.

1096
01:23:51,390 --> 01:23:52,810
Not even
the transponder signal.

1097
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:56,310
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

1098
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,150
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost...

1099
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:06,070
this is Roughneck 2-0 on...

1100
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:11,160
Look out!

1101
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,790
Sugar, your weapon.

1102
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:28,800
Help me! Help me!

1103
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:42,690
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

1104
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,820
- Rico.
- Sir.

1105
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,900
You're acting sergeant.
Move 'em out.

1106
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,160
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!

1107
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,340
Jeez, someone really
humped the bunk.

1108
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:49,630
- Watkins.
- Sir.

1109
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:52,050
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

1110
01:25:52,130 --> 01:25:55,300
Yes, sir. Give me three
up on the tower, now!

1111
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,350
- Aye-aye.
- OP there! OP there!

1112
01:25:57,430 --> 01:26:00,100
- Away!
- Number Two, police up these bodies!

1113
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:02,140
- Stinks in there.
- Second squad, come with me on the gate!

1114
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,480
- Rico! - Churchill, come with me!
- Yes, sir.

1115
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,150
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.

1116
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,480
Get somebody in the communications tent
and get me an uplink.

1117
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:10,440
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.

1118
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:11,940
- Roger.
- Command group with me.

1119
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:17,830
Ah, shit.

1120
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,280
Lieutenant!

1121
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,960
Dirty bugs came in right
while they were having chow.

1122
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:33,470
Yeah, this is
where they got in.

1123
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,340
Lieutenant.

1124
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:40,140
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

1125
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:41,810
What do you got, Flores?

1126
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:43,730
God, I hate this place.

1127
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,200
What does that look like
to you, Rico?

1128
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:05,750
Looks like a bug was
in his brain, sir.

1129
01:27:15,590 --> 01:27:18,180
They sucked his brains out.

1130
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,940
Open that.

1131
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,280
Officer on the deck!

1132
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,860
- Pick up the general.
- Gone?

1133
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,551
Is it safe? We've got
to get out of here!

1134
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:40,870
- General!
- We've gotta... - Sir!

1135
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:48,120
Thank God for you, all of you.

1136
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:51,460
You're all gonna be heroes.
Every last one of you.

1137
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:54,050
- Close that hole.
- Yes, sir.

1138
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:57,300
I had to evade capture. The security
of the Federation was at stake.

1139
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:58,720
Fire in the hole!

1140
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,970
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

1141
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:06,480
- Flores, I need that uplink.
- Working on it, sir.

1142
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:08,560
- Damn it.
- See?

1143
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:10,310
- They get in your mind.
- Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

1144
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,980
- Look, they did it to Farley.
- Do you read?

1145
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:14,150
- They got in his mind.
- Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1146
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:17,320
They make you do things.
They made Farley call headquarters.

1147
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,150
The distress call was a trap.

1148
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,620
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.

1149
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,660
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.

1150
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:26,660
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.

1151
01:28:26,750 --> 01:28:29,080
- I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
- Where's the retrieval boat?

1152
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:32,080
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?

1153
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,000
- Oh, God!
- Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1154
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:37,010
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?

1155
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:38,420
We're all gonna die!

1156
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:41,430
Second squad, follow me!

1157
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:44,470
- Control yourself, General.
- I can't.

1158
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:46,100
I can't.

1159
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:47,810
I wish you'd just shoot me.

1160
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,610
Lieutenant! He's just a little
out of his mind, sir.

1161
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,780
Bugs! Bugs!

1162
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:59,110
- Die!
- All right.

1163
01:28:59,190 --> 01:29:02,110
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!

1164
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,280
- Move!
- Come on, you apes!

1165
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:05,950
You want to live forever?

1166
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,620
- Here!
- I got bugs!

1167
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:41,360
Fire at will!

1168
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:23,200
Incoming!

1169
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,260
Down!

1170
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:47,220
No! Hey!

1171
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:55,140
- Watch your fire!
- Watch casualties!

1172
01:30:55,230 --> 01:30:57,440
Rico, where's my communication?

1173
01:30:57,520 --> 01:30:59,610
- Diz, status on the uplink!
- Give me a minute.

1174
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:01,570
We don't have a minute!

1175
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:12,950
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.
We are under...

1176
01:31:13,040 --> 01:31:16,120
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
- We are under attack, sir. We need retrieval now!

1177
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,620
We have Planet Pas clear.

1178
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:19,790
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!

1179
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:22,130
- What's your position?
- Come down on this transmission.

1180
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:23,800
Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!

1181
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:25,760
Well, I hope you have
a crazy pilot. Out!

1182
01:31:58,330 --> 01:31:59,960
Lieutenant!

1183
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,630
Boat coming down, sir!

1184
01:32:01,710 --> 01:32:05,210
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!

1185
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:32,570
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!

1186
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,590
Running low!

1187
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,340
I'm out!

1188
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:49,680
Here! Make 'em count!

1189
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,030
Make cover fire!
Fall back!

1190
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:28,880
Move, move, move!

1191
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:33,800
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!

1192
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:49,570
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

1193
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,820
- Get him outta there!
- Pull! - Come on!

1194
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,120
Rico! Rico!

1195
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:08,750
- You know what to do!
- Yes, sir!

1196
01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:15,090
Do it, Rico!

1197
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:42,960
- Yeah!
- Dizzy!

1198
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:06,560
No!

1199
01:35:06,650 --> 01:35:09,440
Ace, help me!
Hold her down!

1200
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,570
Move!
Get her into the boat!

1201
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,950
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!

1202
01:35:20,030 --> 01:35:21,510
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!

1203
01:35:27,750 --> 01:35:29,460
Let's go! Get aboard!

1204
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:32,960
Tower, let's go!

1205
01:35:39,090 --> 01:35:43,020
Let's move it, tower!
Run!

1206
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,440
Lift off!

1207
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:25,520
- Johnny, I'm dying-dying.
- No.

1208
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,770
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

1209
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:31,020
It's all right...

1210
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,570
because I got to have you.

1211
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:43,080
Johnny, don't let me go!

1212
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,910
Joh... Joh...

1213
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:47,000
Don't let...
Don't let...

1214
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,430
This is traffic control. Proceed
on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.

1215
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,270
I think you should know...

1216
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,820
your friend Rico is back there.

1217
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,830
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.

1218
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:31,620
On whose authority, Corporal?

1219
01:37:31,710 --> 01:37:34,790
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

1220
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:38,670
Rodger Young,
we have an official request...

1221
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:41,880
by the Mobile Infantry
to commence bombardment of Planet P.

1222
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,640
I thought you were dead.

1223
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,810
I'm not, but a lot
of my troopers are.

1224
01:37:48,890 --> 01:37:50,850
Negative on your request,
DeRuyter.

1225
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:53,150
The Sky Marshal has
other plans for Planet P.

1226
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:54,480
Welcome back.

1227
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,650
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.

1228
01:37:57,730 --> 01:37:59,650
Hold on.
Something's up.

1229
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:02,240
Fleet's mobilized
for a big operation.

1230
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:33,100
Attention on deck!

1231
01:38:40,190 --> 01:38:42,110
Once somebody asked me...

1232
01:38:42,190 --> 01:38:44,610
if I knew the difference
between a citizen...

1233
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,620
and a civilian.

1234
01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:48,280
I can tell you now.

1235
01:38:48,370 --> 01:38:50,450
A citizen has the courage...

1236
01:38:50,540 --> 01:38:55,040
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

1237
01:38:59,210 --> 01:39:01,630
Dizzy was my friend.

1238
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,840
She was a soldier.

1239
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,800
But more than that...

1240
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:08,300
she was a citizen
of the Federation.

1241
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,640
Present arms!

1242
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:33,950
Order arms!

1243
01:39:37,330 --> 01:39:39,080
Left face!

1244
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,270
- Officer on deck!
- Carry on.

1245
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:59,560
Burial detail dismissed.

1246
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:08,780
At ease.

1247
01:40:08,860 --> 01:40:12,120
- How are you, Carl?
- Carmen, good.

1248
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:15,120
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.

1249
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:17,660
That mission had a very low
survival probability.

1250
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,790
The bugs laid a trap
for us, didn't they?

1251
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:23,630
Elegant proof
of intelligence, isn't it?

1252
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:26,170
We thought there might be
a Brain Bug on P.

1253
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:28,180
You knew, and you
sent them anyway?

1254
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:31,640
We couldn't afford to launch an
operation if there wasn't one.

1255
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:36,980
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.

1256
01:40:37,060 --> 01:40:38,980
We're in this for the species,
boys and girls.

1257
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,440
It's simple numbers.
They have more.

1258
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,270
And every day I have
to make decisions...

1259
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:46,190
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.

1260
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:48,650
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

1261
01:40:48,740 --> 01:40:51,070
That's what the Mobile
Infantry is good for.

1262
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,950
I hope you're ready for more.

1263
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:57,330
We're going back to P
to capture that Brain.

1264
01:40:59,370 --> 01:41:02,130
The Roughnecks
are always ready, sir.

1265
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:04,840
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

1266
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:08,920
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.

1267
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,300
Attention. All personnel
report to your stations.

1268
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:17,810
- Well...
- Prepare for drop in 75 minutes.

1269
01:41:17,890 --> 01:41:19,690
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

1270
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:21,560
I'll see you again.

1271
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:36,410
Officer on deck!

1272
01:41:53,840 --> 01:41:57,430
- Who are all these kids?
- We got reinforced.

1273
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:59,730
Most of them are
fresh out of boot.

1274
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,640
We're the old men, Ace.

1275
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:06,270
This is for all you new people.

1276
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,610
I only have one rule:

1277
01:42:08,690 --> 01:42:11,780
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

1278
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:14,950
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

1279
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:16,330
Do you get me?

1280
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:18,450
We get you, sir!

1281
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:23,210
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rico's Roughnecks!

1282
01:42:25,830 --> 01:42:28,420
Today we're gonna pay
a visit to Bug City.

1283
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,800
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.

1284
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,720
Some kind of smart bug.

1285
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:41,600
And it probably knows
we're comin'.

1286
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:45,600
- Saddle up!
- Saddle up now!

1287
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:47,560
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

1288
01:42:59,030 --> 01:43:00,990
Evasive action.

1289
01:43:24,350 --> 01:43:26,150
Get us clear for warp,
Number Two.

1290
01:43:26,230 --> 01:43:28,650
Clear in five, four...

1291
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:30,690
- Initiating star drive...
- Three... - in five.

1292
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,300
This is Rodger Young. We're going down
Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

1293
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:00,800
- Get out! - We're going down.
- Abandon ship! Come on!

1294
01:44:02,220 --> 01:44:04,310
Carmen! Oh!

1295
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:07,140
- Zander!
- Here!

1296
01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:10,360
- We've got to get to the rescue deck!
- Come on!

1297
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,250
Captain!

1298
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:34,090
Abandon ship.
That's an...

1299
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:38,180
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!

1300
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:58,360
Go! Here!

1301
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:15,170
Follow me!

1302
01:45:26,890 --> 01:45:28,060
Ready?

1303
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:35,900
Hit it!

1304
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,300
Life pod Bravo 6-3,
two aboard.

1305
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:08,600
Scanning for a landing zone!
Checking terrain. Here!

1306
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:10,770
- Can you handle that?
- Piece of cake.

1307
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:17,110
- We've lost the Rodger Young!
- What is your position?

1308
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:20,780
Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.

1309
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:22,610
- Oh. Johnny!
- This is Flight Command.

1310
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:24,780
Please repeat.
Please repeat.

1311
01:46:24,870 --> 01:46:28,450
- Johnny!
- We now have confirmation. Rodger Young is down.

1312
01:46:28,540 --> 01:46:30,500
- I repeat, Rodger Young is down.
- Rodger Young just burned up.

1313
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:33,960
- It's on the rescue net.
- Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1314
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,960
- Is anyone receiving?
- Any survivors? - Is anyone receiving?

1315
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:39,670
- Well, they're getting tarred up there pretty bad.
- Life pod...

1316
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:41,130
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

1317
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:42,800
Is anyone receiving?

1318
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,320
- Is anyone receiving?
- Affirmative.

1319
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:45,840
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1320
01:46:45,930 --> 01:46:47,470
You're breaking up.
Say again.

1321
01:46:47,550 --> 01:46:49,930
- Carmen?
- Say again. I'm losing you.

1322
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:51,350
Carmen!

1323
01:46:55,270 --> 01:46:56,650
Prepare for landing.

1324
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:58,570
Retros in three...

1325
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:01,150
two, one, fire!

1326
01:47:17,210 --> 01:47:19,000
Carmen. Carmen.

1327
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:21,260
- Hey, are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

1328
01:47:21,340 --> 01:47:22,760
Get out.
Get out.

1329
01:47:32,390 --> 01:47:36,520
This is Roughneck 2-0. Are you
receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2-0.

1330
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:40,070
- Carmen, are you receiving? -Johnny, is that you?
- Yeah!

1331
01:47:40,150 --> 01:47:42,860
- It's me! Wh-What's your position and situation?
- Yeah.

1332
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,570
We're in Bug City,
20 metres underground.

1333
01:47:44,650 --> 01:47:47,910
Position:
South 42, east 118.

1334
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:50,030
Situation is...

1335
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,910
I repeat.
South 42, east 118.

1336
01:47:51,990 --> 01:47:54,410
What's your situation?
Over.

1337
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:55,870
Carmen.

1338
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,040
Situation is extremely hostile.

1339
01:48:04,970 --> 01:48:06,930
I need a squad to pull 'em out!

1340
01:48:07,010 --> 01:48:09,220
- Direction?
- Three clicks, south by southwest.

1341
01:48:15,680 --> 01:48:17,390
Look out!

1342
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:38,830
- What do you wanna do?
- You heard the lieutenant.

1343
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:43,250
Rescue party!
Third squad, come with me!

1344
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:45,760
Cancel that!

1345
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:48,590
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.

1346
01:48:52,010 --> 01:48:53,350
Sorry, buddy.

1347
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:58,940
Roughnecks, let's move.

1348
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:01,100
All right.

1349
01:49:15,870 --> 01:49:17,790
Why didn't they kill us?

1350
01:49:17,870 --> 01:49:20,040
They want us alive.

1351
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:16,350
We should go this way.

1352
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,100
A Company's that way.

1353
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:24,440
Yeah, but Carmen's down there.

1354
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:27,860
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.

1355
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,610
She's still alive.

1356
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:32,950
How do you know?

1357
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:35,740
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
- Listen.

1358
01:50:35,820 --> 01:50:38,240
You got command,
but going off mission...

1359
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:40,700
- That's a serious offence.
- Yeah.

1360
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:42,750
I think they hang you for that.

1361
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,800
Roughneck 2-0,
proceed on mission.

1362
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:51,510
I need two volunteers.

1363
01:52:02,330 --> 01:52:03,830
One day...

1364
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:06,330
someone like me...

1365
01:52:06,420 --> 01:52:08,170
is gonna kill you...

1366
01:52:08,250 --> 01:52:10,380
and your whole fucking race.

1367
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,600
You know what this is?

1368
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:14,940
Sure you do.

1369
01:53:16,530 --> 01:53:19,110
You're some kind
of big, fat, smart bug...

1370
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:20,530
aren't you?

1371
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,740
Come on.

1372
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:37,920
This is Roughneck 2-0.

1373
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:41,640
Brain Bug sighted moving
west of grid five.

1374
01:53:43,890 --> 01:53:45,310
Run!

1375
01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:17,880
Go! Go!

1376
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,430
- Give me the nuke!
- You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

1377
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:26,970
I'm trying to kill
some bugs, sir!

1378
01:54:27,060 --> 01:54:30,230
Get outta here!
Get outta here!

1379
01:54:31,770 --> 01:54:33,100
Move!

1380
01:54:37,780 --> 01:54:41,030
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!

1381
01:54:41,110 --> 01:54:42,450
You want a little more?

1382
01:54:45,870 --> 01:54:49,150
You like that? You like that? You like that?
You like that? You want a little more?

1383
01:54:55,170 --> 01:54:56,380
Come on! Come on!

1384
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:03,050
Come on, come on, come on!

1385
01:55:27,570 --> 01:55:28,780
Come on, Carmen.

1386
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:43,630
- We did it!
- We won!

1387
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:51,180
- What's going on?
- They got it!

1388
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:52,430
Come on!

1389
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:09,990
Pull! Pull! Pull!

1390
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:23,920
Quiet!

1391
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:37,730
What's it thinking, Colonel?

1392
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:57,080
It's afraid.

1393
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,830
It's afraid!

1394
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:07,300
- Come on.
- Yeah!

1395
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:09,800
Carl! Carl! Hey!

1396
01:57:09,890 --> 01:57:12,810
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

1397
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:16,180
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

1398
01:57:16,270 --> 01:57:17,770
Well, that's classified.

1399
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:22,650
You know, whenever
the three of us are together...

1400
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:25,650
I feel like things
might just work out.

1401
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:27,650
I hope you're right, Carmen.

1402
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:30,660
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

1403
01:57:30,740 --> 01:57:33,330
And then we'll know
how to beat them.

1404
01:57:33,410 --> 01:57:35,490
One day it will all be over...

1405
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:38,500
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

1406
01:57:38,580 --> 01:57:41,500
This is when it turned.

1407
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:45,670
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

1408
01:57:49,590 --> 01:57:52,680
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

1409
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:54,350
Come on!
Who am I?

1410
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:56,560
- Yeah!
- Zim?

1411
01:57:57,980 --> 01:58:00,310
He got him! Yeah!

1412
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:02,650
Zim. Zim got the bug.

1413
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:04,310
Zim got the bug, man!

1414
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,690
- Good job, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

1415
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:12,610
- That would be private, sir.
- Carry on, Private.

1416
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:15,330
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

1417
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:22,830
What mysteries
will the Brain Bug reveal?

1418
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:27,840
Federal scientists are working
around the clock to probe its secrets.

1419
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,430
Once we understand the bug,
we will defeat it.

1420
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:39,100
We have the ships.

1421
01:58:39,180 --> 01:58:40,520
We have the weapons.

1422
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:44,020
We need soldiers.

1423
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,360
Soldiers like
Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.

1424
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,530
We're over the target
area now, Captain.

1425
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:51,780
- And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
- This is the captain speaking.

1426
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,530
All personnel prepare for drop.

1427
01:58:53,610 --> 01:58:56,370
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.

1428
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:59,950
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

1429
01:59:00,040 --> 01:59:01,500
We need you all.

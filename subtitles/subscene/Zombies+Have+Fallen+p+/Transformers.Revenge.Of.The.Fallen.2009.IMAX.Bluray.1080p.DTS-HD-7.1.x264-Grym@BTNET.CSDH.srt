00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,582
And the newest members of your team.

315
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,960
- Easy.
- I understand they arrived here

316
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,920
after you sent a message into space,

317
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:12,757
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

318
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:16,594
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

319
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:20,598
<i>And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team</i>

320
00:23:20,683 --> 00:23:23,601
has always been above reproach.

321
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,521
<i>Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</i>

322
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:32,151
<i>that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</i>

323
00:23:32,861 --> 00:23:35,363
Now, what do we know so far?

324
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:41,869
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

325
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:45,540
<i>is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</i>

326
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:50,128
<i>surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.</i>

327
00:23:50,212 --> 00:23:54,632
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

328
00:23:54,717 --> 00:23:56,634
<i>is locked in an electromagnetic vault</i>

329
00:23:56,719 --> 00:24:00,054
<i>here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.</i>

330

<font color="#808080">SOUNDWAVE</font>: Decepticons, we have located the shard.

331
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:10,565
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

332
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,484
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

333
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,404
You! The Autobots!

334
00:24:17,239 --> 00:24:19,532
They're here to hunt you!

335
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,577
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

337
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:27,832
It sounds to me
like something's coming.

338
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:32,670
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

339
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:36,466
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

340
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:41,471
will you leave peacefully?

341
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:46,434
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

342
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:52,774
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

343
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:57,737
What if we leave and you're wrong?

344
00:25:05,287 --> 00:25:07,288
That's a good question.

Welcome to Astronomy 101.

629
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,769
For what do we know about the stars?

630
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:19,731
Virgo, the virgin.

631
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,734
Orion, the great hunter.

632
00:44:22,818 --> 00:44:27,447
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

633
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:29,866
No, they are dynamos

Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

636

- Energy equals mass...

I just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

641
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,473

mass times the velocity

643
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,686

Nobody ever talks about the other 17.

649
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:14,828

can't possibly explain.

01:09:01,129 --> 01:09:03,672
<i>which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.</i>

944
01:09:03,756 --> 01:09:05,716
<i>President Obama
is being flown to a bunker</i>

945
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,467
<i>somewhere in the middle
of the United States</i>

946
01:09:07,552 --> 01:09:12,014
<i>in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.</i>

947
01:09:12,098 --> 01:09:17,477
<i>The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.</i>

948
01:09:17,562 --> 01:09:20,731
<i>Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,</i>

949
01:09:20,815 --> 01:09:22,524
<i>but that number could climb.</i>

950
01:09:22,608 --> 01:09:23,650
It's still too early to tell.

951
01:09:23,735 --> 01:09:26,153
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

952
01:09:26,237 --> 01:09:29,156
<i><font color="#808080">MALE ANNOUNCER 3</font>: The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.</i>

953
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:31,950
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

954
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:34,369
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

955
01:09:34,454 --> 01:09:37,789
<i>are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.</i>

956

<font color="#808080">LEO</font>: You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

957
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,711
- <font color="#808080">MALE ANNOUNCER 4</font>: They have a traffic-camera spotting...
-They have a picture of me, man.

958
01:09:42,795 --> 01:09:46,214
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

959
01:09:46,466 --> 01:09:47,507
I just need you to focus

960
01:09:47,592 --> 01:09:48,550
- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.

961
01:09:48,634 --> 01:09:50,218
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

962
01:09:50,303 --> 01:09:51,970
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

963
01:09:52,055 --> 01:09:54,014
- Do you see this?
- What?

964
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:58,769
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

965
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,812
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay, I'm not even with you guys!

966
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:03,231
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

967
01:10:03,316 --> 01:10:04,608
- Enough is...
- <font color="#808080">MUDFLAP</font>: Yo, Leo!

968
01:10:04,942 --> 01:10:07,069
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

969
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:09,529
- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?

970
01:10:09,614 --> 01:10:10,572
I think he's scared.

971
01:10:10,656 --> 01:10:13,200
<font color="#808080">SKIDS</font>: Hey, Mudflap, what are we
gonna do with this shrimp taco?

972
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:14,618
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

973
01:10:14,702 --> 01:10:16,244
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?

974
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:19,247
- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.

975
01:10:19,332 --> 01:10:21,541
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you!

976
01:10:21,626 --> 01:10:23,794
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

977
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:25,420
I've had a hell of a day!

978
01:10:26,506 --> 01:10:28,924
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

979
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:30,133
Go whine to your boyfriend!

980
01:10:30,218 --> 01:10:32,427
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do,
man. Look, I'm just going to go

981
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:33,553
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

982
01:10:33,638 --> 01:10:34,638
Like, I had nothing to do with this.

983
01:10:34,722 --> 01:10:36,264
- So, I'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, hey, you wanted this, right?

984
01:10:36,349 --> 01:10:37,682
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

985
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,101
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

986
01:10:39,185 --> 01:10:41,520
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

987
01:10:42,522 --> 01:10:44,147
Stop complaining.

988
01:11:20,393 --> 01:11:21,893
What is the meaning of this?

989
01:11:22,228 --> 01:11:24,146
You dare point a gun at me?

990
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:27,983
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

991
01:11:29,735 --> 01:11:32,362
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

992
01:11:32,446 --> 01:11:33,905
- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.

993
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:35,031
Tell them to lower their weapons.

994
01:11:35,116 --> 01:11:37,117
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

995
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:39,077
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

996
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:42,080
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

997
01:11:42,165 --> 01:11:44,499
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

998
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:46,960
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

999
01:11:47,044 --> 01:11:48,837
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1000
01:11:48,921 --> 01:11:51,423
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.

1001
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,966
I have operational command now.

1002
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:55,260
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

1003
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,970
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

1004
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:59,097
The secret is out!

1005
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:02,442
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

1006
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,444
with a coordinated military strategy.

1007
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,489
This fool is terribly misinformed.

1008
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,949
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

1009
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,742
What we need is to draw up battle plans

1010
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,995
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

1011
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,579
Like what, handing over the kid?

1012
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,749
All options are being considered.

1013
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,295
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

1014
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,465
- There is no negotiating with them.
- I'm ordering you to stand down.

1015
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,636
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

1016
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,931
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

1017
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,475
Let's go!

1018
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:40,647
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

1019

<i><font color="#808080">MAN ON PA</font>: Autobots, report to hangar

1020
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:48,655
- Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.

1021
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,843
There's nothing
that you could have done.

1022
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,558
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1023
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,564
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

1024
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,533

Hey, you know the glyphs?

1036
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,586
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

1037
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,383
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

1038
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,009
That's some serious stuff, right there.

1039
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,138
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

1040
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,639
Like a map to an Energon source!

1041

- Can you read this?
- Read?

1042
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,353
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

1043
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,480
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

1044

Aw, look who came sashaying back!

1045
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:48,859
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

1046
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,777
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

1047
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:51,987
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

1048
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,947
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.

1049
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:55,657
I heard you have a problem.

1050
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:58,743
- I think I know someone who can help.
- Who?

1051

- Know him?
- I never heard of him.

1070

You never heard of

amateur- hour blog operation

01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:07,062
- with Game Boy- level security.
- Robo- Warrior.

1073
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:11,024
It's him! It's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

1074
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:13,526
No.

1075
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:16,404
- You got to be kidding me.
- All right, meat store's closed!

1076
01:16:16,489 --> 01:16:18,865
- Everybody out! Out, right now!
- When he says to go,

1077
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,533
- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.

1078

- Wait a minute. You know this guy?
- We're old friends.

1079
01:16:22,828 --> 01:16:26,289
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1080
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:27,707
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1081
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,044
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1082
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:34,089
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1083
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:38,468
- Look at her now, so mature.
- Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1084

You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

- It's my dream.
- Help her out.

01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,063
You live with your mama?

1090
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,481
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1091

- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1093
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,154
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1094
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,615
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1095
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,451
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

Look, hold on, I need your help.

1097
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,665
Really? You need my help?

1098
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:11,376
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.

1099
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,086
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1100
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,297
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1101
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,216
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1102
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,052
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1103
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,305
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1104
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,974
- Right.
- Meat locker, now!

1105
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:27,976
- <font color="#808080">LEO</font>: Dead pigs.
- <font color="#808080">MIKAELA</font>: Yuck.

1106
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,228
What you're about to see is top secret.

1107
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,023
Do not tell my mother.

1108
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,151
- <font color="#808080">SAM</font>: Swine flu. Not good.
- <font color="#808080">SIMMONS</font>: Now you know.

1109
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,195
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1110
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,572
Sad little story.

1111
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,823
<i><font color="#808080">MAN ON TV</font>: An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</i>

1112
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,991
<i>Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</i>

1113
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,244
<font color="#808080">SIMMONS</font>: Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1114
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,539
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1115
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,250
Okay, Cube- brain.

1116
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,086
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1117
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,504
Where'd you get these?

1118
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,258
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,

1119
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:05,722
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1120
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,768
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1121
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,269
How do I know?

1122
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,272
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1123
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,608
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1124
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,110
China. Egypt. Greece.

1125
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,654
Shot in 1932.

1126
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,573
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1127
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,242
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1128
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,122
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1129
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,126
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.

1130
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,129
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1131
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,093
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1132
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,471
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1133
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,058
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1134
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,686
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1135
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,231
that I was obsessed.

1136
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,066
Me. Can you imagine that?

1137
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,277
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1138
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,238
- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.

1139
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,199
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1140
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,034
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1141
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,411
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1142
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,329
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1143
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,497
It's before them.

1144
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,582
- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.

1145
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,044
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1146
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,213
I mean,
I'm not on speaking terms with them.

1147
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,006
Actually, I am.

1148
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,054
<font color="#808080">WHEELIE</font>: Let me out!

1149
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,390
- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1150
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,227
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1151
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,770
Hey, behave!

1152
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,689
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1153
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,566
- And you're training him?
- I'm trying to.

1154
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,153
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1155
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,573
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1156
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,617
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro- head?

1157
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,871
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1158
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,082
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1159
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,584
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1160
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,045
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1161
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,256
All right.

1162
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,594
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1163
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:11,181
I don't read it, but these guys...

1164
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,766
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1165
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,645
- Is this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1166
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,316
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.

1167
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,903
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1168
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,322
- And I know where to find them.
- Show us.

1169
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,740
Yeah.

1172
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,506
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1173
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,551
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1174
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,554
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1175
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,142
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.

1176
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,727
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1177
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,689
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1178
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,525
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1179
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,902
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1180
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,695
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1181
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,531
Okay. Now, let's get this show

Yeah, I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

- Guards have guns. I don't want to die.

You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

Five guards.

- The Decepticons.

01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,878
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1262
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:54,482
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1263
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,818
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1264
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,944
Nothing!

1265
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:01,697
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1266
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:09,539

Honestly, I don't.

It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1273
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,851
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1274
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,145
- Him and someone called The Fallen.
- The Fallen? I know him.

1275
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,482
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1276
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:40,361
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

You didn't tell us anything.

You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1308

Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1309
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,644
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1310
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,147
<font color="#808080">JETFIRE</font>: This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1311
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,984
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1312
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,987
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1313
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,656
the lifeblood of our race.

1314
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,577
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1315

Let's not get episodic, okay, old- timer?

1317
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:06,590
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1318
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:11,512
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1319
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,808
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1320
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,601
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1321
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,562
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1322
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:22,773
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1323
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,944
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1324
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:33,034
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1325
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,037
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1326
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,374
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1327
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,503
He despised the human race

1328
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,884
<i>and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.</i>

1329
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:54,013
<i>The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</i>

1330
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,183
<i>called the Matrix of Leadership.</i>

1331
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,860
<i>A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</i>

1332
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,159
<i>The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</i>

1333
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,998
<i>so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</i>

1334
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,462
<i>In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</i>

1335
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,715
<i>in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</i>

1336
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,344
<i>a tomb we cannot find.</i>

1337
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,476
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1338
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,603
The Fallen knows where it is

1339
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:48,317
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1340
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,319
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1341
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,780
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1342
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,448
Optimus Prime?

1343
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,994
So, you've met a Prime?

1344
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,164
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1345
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,376
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1346
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,379
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1347
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,297
So, he's dead.

1348
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,468
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1349
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,556
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1350
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,267
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1351
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:22,393
and bring him back to life?

1352
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:27,189
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1353
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,152
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1354
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,446
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1355
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,158
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1356
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,454
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1357
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,498

It's your mission now.

01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:53,841
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1361
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,682
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1362
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,311
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1363
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,271
- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- It's part of the Red Sea.

1364
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,523
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1365
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,444
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1366
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,905
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1367
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,449

Okay, I want you to listen very carefully

Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

Right next to that's a fabric webbing

All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1499
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:13,131

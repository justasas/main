1
00:00:00,827 --> 00:00:02,406
When God created man,

2
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:05,469
a jealous Lucifer mounted
a great rebellion in Heaven.

3
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:07,633
His army of angels
was defeated

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:09,696
and forever banished
from paradise.

5
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:11,942
These angels, the Fallen,

6
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:14,522
abandoned Lucifer,
choosing to live on Earth

7
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:16,119
among the pleasures of humans.

8
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:19,531
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

9
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,354
children called Nephilim.

10
00:00:21,603 --> 00:00:24,483
They have the powers
of angels
but the souls of men.

11
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:26,996
Angry, the Creator
flooded the Earth,

12
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,175
killing the Nephilim
and driving the Fallen
into hiding.

13
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:33,074
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

14
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:35,071
to hunt those
that survived the flood.

15
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:38,932
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy.

16
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:40,829
A Nephilim would be born

17
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:43,241
who would redeem them
and return them to paradise.

18
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,703
So the Fallen watched...
and waited.

19
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:02,231
Sometimes I...

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,242
wonder what it would be like
if Lucifer had won
the war.

21
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,689
I mean, it's not like
he got us on his side

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,155
with promises of an evil empire
and

23
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,927
eternal suffering.

24
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:17,071
All that came later...
after the Fall.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,566
I've tried my best
to make up
for what I've done.

26
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:23,677
To help the humans
defend themselves

27
00:01:23,678 --> 00:01:25,807
against what I helped to create.
But...

28
00:01:26,365 --> 00:01:29,827
I mean, there's just
as much hate in the world,
just as much suffering.

29
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,797
More, even.
So have I atoned
for what I have done?

30
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,209
I don't know.

31
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:44,545
I just know
I wanna go home.

32
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,578
Then that's where you'll go.

33
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,612
It's been one year since I found out
that I have the power

34
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:52,883
to send Fallen angels
back to Heaven.

35
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:56,510
But the Powers can sense
every redemption.

36
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:00,770
And we always risk
the possibility of an attack.

37
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,600
So we never stop running.

38
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,159
So many Fallen...

39
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,554
yet to be redeemed.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,696
Be patient.

41
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:41,390
Stay here.

42
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:44,469
I'm fighting with you this time.
No, you're not.

43
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,901
I'm not gonna just sit here.

44
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,096
Aaron!

45
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,739
Most Nephilim
don't put up a fight.

46
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:21,703
Well, I'm not like
most Nephilim.

47
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,987
You'll die like them,
though.

48
00:04:42,187 --> 00:04:44,701
I don't know what just happened to me.
I told you to stay in the car.

49
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,665
It's like I almost
wasn't even there.

50
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:50,125
I remember fighting, but it's
like remembering a dream.

51
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,879
I felt like I could take on
the Powers all by myself.

52
00:04:52,929 --> 00:04:56,972
- I almost felt like I was invincible.
- You are far from it.

53
00:04:58,287 --> 00:05:01,349
When you lose control like that,
you are losing the very thing

54
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,164
that gives you the advantage
over your opponent.

55
00:05:04,777 --> 00:05:07,257
You are as powerful
as any angel there is,
Aaron.

56
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,720
But your humanity
makes you stronger.

57
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:13,459
In time, you will learn
to master this duality,

58
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,670
but until then you will focus
on returning the Fallen
to Heaven,

59
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,885
and you will leave
the fighting to me.

60
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:22,364
If I hadn't fought,
you'd be dead right now,
Camael.

61
00:05:25,854 --> 00:05:29,465
Your journey...
has just begun.

62
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,974
You must be patient.

63
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:49,510
You all right?

64
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,854
I could heal you.

65
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,884
He did heal me,
Camael.

66
00:05:57,297 --> 00:06:01,092
A wound...
caused by angelfire is much different.

67
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,153
You cannot heal it.

68
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,897
What are we
gonna do, then?

69
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,126
Find someone who can.

70
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:46,499
She's gone, Ariel.

71
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,921
Get the paddles, Clarence.

72
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:53,519
Get the paddles.

73
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:08,327
Nobody dies on my watch.

74
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:25,643
Welcome back.

75
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:29,428
Drop me off here.

76
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:33,194
This may take some time.

77
00:07:38,328 --> 00:07:39,243
Camael.

78
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:42,726
Could we check out
the school?

79
00:07:43,594 --> 00:07:45,987
Fine.
But stay close.

80
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,330
And that's the long history of division,
as nation after nation suffered the effects...

81
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,512
Aaron, this is bigger
than your old school.

82
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,315
Well, this is college.
It's different.

83
00:07:55,981 --> 00:07:59,183
...and every freethinking
individual is a lost prophet.

84
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,892
And every poetic prophecy
is a conscious conspiracy

85
00:08:02,057 --> 00:08:04,438
to emancipate ourselves
from mental slavery.

86
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,372
And we will get free or die.

87
00:08:08,106 --> 00:08:09,971
Because the numbers
don't lie.

88
00:08:11,238 --> 00:08:13,138
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:16,981
I wasn't even watching where I was going.
No, I wasn't watching where I was going.

90
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:17,779
Hi.

91
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,735
Paradise Lost.
I know, it, uh...

92
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:21,791
Yawn.

93
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:28,154
So, uh,
what's your major?

94
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:30,653
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't, uh...

95
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,870
I don't... I don't go
to school here.

96
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:35,130
Uh, just...
just visiting.

97
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:36,397
Yeah.

98
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,402
Right.

99
00:08:38,555 --> 00:08:39,529
Looks pretty cool,
though.

100
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,012
Yeah, it's okay.

101
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,448
- I'm Chloe.
- Aaron.

102
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:48,851
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:55,519
Excuse me,
is there something
I can help you with?

104
00:08:56,765 --> 00:08:58,853
Hey, you're not supposed
to be in here.

105
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,117
He's right...

106
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,245
you're notsupposed to be here.

107
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,107
- Ariel.
- Punisher.

108
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,367
Punisher?

109
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:10,842
Yeah, that's what we called
him in high school.

110
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:12,989
Linebacker.

111
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:23,179
Wow. This is great.

112
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:26,241
What's it like,
going to college?

113
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:28,658
I don't know.
It's pretty fun,
I guess.

114
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,300
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

115
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:33,279
I mean, it's true what they say,
you know.

116
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:36,255
Being away from your parents
in a different environment,

117
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,273
you really do learn
a lot about yourself.

118
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,830
What have you learned?

119
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,044
that I like partying
almost as much as I hate hangovers.

120
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:51,537
Uh, how come
you don't go?

121
00:09:53,284 --> 00:09:55,384
I... I want to.
I do.

122
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:58,457
I guess I just...

123
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,187
I got a lot going on
in my...
in my life right now.

124
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:08,428
Well, if you're interested,
you can come to class with me.

125
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,082
Help me stay awake.

126
00:10:10,164 --> 00:10:11,267
You can do that?

127
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:13,832
Well, they won't let any random
person come in off the street,

128
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:16,436
but if you're accompanied
by an actual student...

129
00:10:17,211 --> 00:10:18,712
I suppose I could vouch
for you.

130
00:10:19,873 --> 00:10:20,741
Thanks.

131
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, I'd love to
i'd do something like that.

132
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:27,149
I would, um...
I just, uh...

133
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,308
I don't know
if I can.

134
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
Why not?
You need Gabe's permission or something?

135
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:33,797
I like her, Aaron.

136
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,141
Come on, 9:00 tomorrow
in that building right over there.

137
00:10:38,396 --> 00:10:39,498
I'm gonna meet you
out front.

138
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,072
I'll see you there.

139
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:19,595
Hello?

140
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:22,281
Who's there?

141
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:28,506
Don't tell me it's judgment day already.

142
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:34,799
I was just getting comfortable.

143
00:11:35,538 --> 00:11:36,826
No, Azazel.

144
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:39,090
Not yet.

145
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:43,301
But soon.
Before you know it,

146
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,277
Gabriel's horn
will sound,

147
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:51,345
and you will be cast
into the fires of Hell for all eternity.

148
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:56,556
I doubt you'll find that
environment any more hospitable.

149
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:02,567
Well, at least it will be
a change of scenery.

150
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,509
What...

151
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:11,063
is this language
we're speaking?

152
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:13,116
It's called English.

153
00:12:14,137 --> 00:12:16,894
It's been very popular
on Earth
for quite some time.

154
00:12:19,075 --> 00:12:20,765
How long have
I been here?

155
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,470
5,000 years.

156
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:26,637
Give or take a century.

157
00:12:27,752 --> 00:12:28,995
I'm curious.

158
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:33,071
Did you think more time had passed,
or less?

159
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,698
What do you want?

160
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,716
To give you...
what you desire most.

161
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,528
You'd give me my freedom?

162
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:50,611
If you agree to help me.

163
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,381
It is the time
of the Redeemer, Azazel.

164
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:57,185
As the prophecy
has foretold,

165
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:02,718
a Nephilim has been born
with the power to return fallen angels to Heaven.

166
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:08,196
And I need you...
to help him fulfill his destiny.

167
00:13:10,466 --> 00:13:11,393
So...

168
00:13:13,094 --> 00:13:14,666
do we have an agreement?

169
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,982
We most certainly do.

170
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:03,942
How are you, Gadreel?

171
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:10,734
How did you get out?

172
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,670
Don't concern yourself
with such things.

173
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,933
You know, you got to learn
how to blend in.

174
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:25,062
That's how I stayed alive for so long.

175
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,877
Fine, but there's something
I should rather do first.

176
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:30,912
I'll bet there is.
But you waited 5,000 years.

177
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,129
You can wait
a few more hours.

178
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:34,830
Can you?

179
00:14:37,219 --> 00:14:38,568
Thousands have taken to the streets

180
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:41,947
<i>in protests of the arrests of
anti-Russian activists this morning.</i>

181
00:14:42,486 --> 00:14:44,840
<i>Cars were set on fire
and storefronts smashed,</i>

182
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,861
<i>as an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy
in the capital of Rome.</i>

183
00:14:47,862 --> 00:14:49,690
So who is
this woman, anyway?

184
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,113
<i>Over in the Middle East
oil fires were still burning...</i>

185
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:54,025
Ariel took over
the underground

186
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:56,700
after the death
of Samchial last year.

187
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:01,777
She's the one who has been giving me
the locations of those you have redeemed.

188
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,513
She's in charge
of the Fallen?

189
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:05,448
Yes.

190
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:12,142
Aaron.

191
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,722
It is so good
to finally meet you.

192
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:22,593
God, I feel like I already know you.
Camael's told me so much about you.

193
00:15:23,344 --> 00:15:24,975
He did not tell me how good-looking
you were, though.

194
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:26,582
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

195
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm not exactly his type.

196
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,384
What?

197
00:15:35,193 --> 00:15:38,008
It's just... Usually when I'm
around the Fallen, I get this...

198
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:41,559
weird feeling.

199
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:46,040
Um, it's how I know
they need redemption.

200
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,296
I don't feel that need
from you.

201
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:58,977
You're picking up
on their desire
for forgiveness,

202
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,018
their beliefs
that they're ready.

203
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:07,308
You know, and whether they're worthy
of redemption or not is a whole other story.

204
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:10,560
But you're not picking it up from me,
because it's not my time yet.

205
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:14,612
I'll be the last Fallen
you'll redeem, Aaron.

206
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,702
Comes with the gig.

207
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,359
Welcome.
There's a bedroom for you upstairs.

208
00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:29,897
Come on, Gabe,

209
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:42,468
The Nephilim
has escaped us again.

210
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:46,457
You have disgraced us
with your incompetence.

211
00:16:48,018 --> 00:16:50,411
You're the mightiest angels
on Heaven and Earth.

212
00:16:51,068 --> 00:16:53,379
And you can't dispose
of one simple half-breed.

213
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:57,191
The Nephilim we could handle.
It's Camael that's the problem.

214
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,469
Mazarin, the energy signature
that drew us here,

215
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,955
there's something different
about it.

216
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,501
What if the traitor
is right?

217
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:10,231
What is this Nephilim he's been dragging
all over the country really is the Redeemer?

218
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,861
There is no Reedemer,
Sachael.

219
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:17,104
It is the Powers' mission
to eradicate all of the Nephilim.

220
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,412
This one is no different
from the rest.

221
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,204
Now, when we catch up
with the little bastard,
and we will,

222
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:25,570
the prophecy will become
a dead issue.

223
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:33,240
You've been killing a lot
of your old friends lately.

224
00:17:34,824 --> 00:17:36,208
I take no pleasure in it.

225
00:17:36,278 --> 00:17:39,919
Yeah, that's what you used to say
when you used to kill us Fallen.

226
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,335
It was true then, as well.

227
00:17:44,552 --> 00:17:45,737
So how's he doing?

228
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:49,359
He's struggling.

229
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:53,922
His angelic and human desires
are at constant odds.

230
00:17:54,626 --> 00:17:59,212
Yeah, well...
all Nephilim are like that the first few years.

231
00:18:00,194 --> 00:18:01,508
It'll get better.

232
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,431
It's getting worse.

233
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,332
Maybe you're just
working him too hard.

234
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:23,034
You're new here,
ain'tcha?

235
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:24,746
Er... Yeah.

236
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:29,309
Then he went out back
with Gina for, like, 15 minutes.

237
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,435
Gina?

238
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,371
The barmaid.

239
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:35,963
He doesn't
even know her name.

240
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,605
Damn, man.

241
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:41,488
You're all right.
What's with the threads,
though?

242
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:42,638
Threads?

243
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:45,479
Oh, you mean my clothes.

244
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:47,766
I like the way you talk.

245
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:50,065
- The way I what?
- The way I what?

246
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,705
So, you're
a gambling man, huh?

247
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,268
You up for a game?

248
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,114
So how does one
play this game?

249
00:19:08,115 --> 00:19:12,137
Hold your horses, chief.
We only play for money.

250
00:19:12,313 --> 00:19:14,131
I have neither money
nor horses.

251
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,494
- But I'll wager you a night with Gina...
- We could do that.

252
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,664
for your mode
of transportation.

253
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:21,318
My bike?

254
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:26,992
Okay, here.

255
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,032
I smell a fight.

256
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:31,434
You better come through
once you lose.

257
00:19:33,685 --> 00:19:35,515
Teach him
some manners, buddy!

258
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,354
It's goin' down.

259
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:55,922
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

260
00:19:56,903 --> 00:19:58,284
Wait a minute now!

261
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,184
You don't mean
my bike, man!

262
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,612
We had a deal,
didn't we...

263
00:20:03,339 --> 00:20:04,301
man?

264
00:20:05,111 --> 00:20:08,646
You want my bike?
Come take it.

265
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:48,666
Bad dreams again?

266
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,571
You ever have nightmares?

267
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:52,385
Sometimes.

268
00:20:54,989 --> 00:20:56,042
You know how to stop them?

269
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,266
All you have to do is wake up.

270
00:21:06,586 --> 00:21:07,246
Morning.

271
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:08,381
Good morning.

272
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,087
I've never seen
him sleep before.

273
00:21:25,581 --> 00:21:26,613
He's not sleeping.

274
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:28,242
He's healing.

275
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:30,964
Angelfire wounds
can be bad news.

276
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,748
In time,
even a little nick
would have killed him.

277
00:21:34,903 --> 00:21:35,439
Don't worry.

278
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,482
By tonight,
he'll be good as new.

279
00:21:46,494 --> 00:21:49,278
Mmm, I love waffles.

280
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:53,052
Thanks.

281
00:22:00,214 --> 00:22:04,916
I haven't had a...
real breakfast
in what seems like forever.

282
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:08,236
You miss
your parents, huh?

283
00:22:09,556 --> 00:22:11,618
I just haven't seen them
in a really long time.

284
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:14,182
I wish there was
a way I could...

285
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:17,914
get a hold of them
and just
tell them that
I'm okay, you know?

286
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:18,760
I know.

287
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:21,440
But it's safer
for them this way.

288
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:31,009
Do you know who
my real father
and mother are?

289
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:35,669
The Fallen don't
exactly advertise it
when one of them
becomes a daddy.

290
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:37,979
It's a good way
to get the Powers
all over your ass.

291
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:40,907
Yeah.

292
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:43,134
Camael pretty much
said the same thing.

293
00:22:43,835 --> 00:22:44,207
Yeah.

294
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:49,754
Hey, um...
Do you think it would
be all right if I...

295
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:52,704
went by the, uh,
college
and, uh,

296
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:55,694
just checked out
a couple of the classes?

297
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:58,601
Well, you're a big boy.
You don't need
my permission.

298
00:22:58,988 --> 00:23:00,818
It's just that Camael
never lets me

299
00:23:01,357 --> 00:23:04,117
go anywhere
or do anything.

300
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,173
You're in Ariel's house now.
And I say you can do
whatever you want.

301
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,577
Just no angel stuff.

302
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:18,624
Angels.
Warring amongst themselves
because of mankind.

303
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:23,982
Lucifer's ambition
sprang from envy
that angels

304
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:27,243
were no longer God's
favorite creation.

305
00:23:28,017 --> 00:23:30,070
At the beginning
of Milton's epic,

306
00:23:31,028 --> 00:23:33,409
he has suffered
a crushing defeat.

307
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,907
Lucifer and his followers

308
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,743
had been banished
from Heaven forever.

309
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:44,587
We see him struggling
with self-doubt.

310
00:23:44,951 --> 00:23:47,708
We see he has hopes
and fears,

311
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:50,206
just like us.

312
00:23:51,207 --> 00:23:53,565
We identify with him.

313
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,122
Yes?

314
00:23:56,779 --> 00:23:59,500
So, the devil...
he's a good guy?

315
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:05,640
Well...
he's certainly sympathetic.

316
00:24:07,317 --> 00:24:09,558
Lucifer sees himself
as a victim.

317
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:14,434
And it's fair to question
whether the Rebellion

318
00:24:15,032 --> 00:24:19,442
was his design,
or pre-ordained destiny.

319
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:20,721
Wait a second.

320
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,892
Are you saying that Lucifer was

321
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:27,648
created to rebel?

322
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:30,018
Is that so hard to believe?

323
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:33,686
What is good without evil?

324
00:24:35,914 --> 00:24:37,498
Does doing the right thing

325
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,626
have any meaning

326
00:24:41,729 --> 00:24:43,688
if there is
no alternative?

327
00:24:45,154 --> 00:24:46,573
But that doesn't make
any sense.

328
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:51,872
Even if Lucifer
was destined to become
the epitome of evil,

329
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:57,163
he made the choice
to follow that path.

330
00:25:11,894 --> 00:25:14,252
o/~ It's never gonna be o/~

331
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:17,525
o/~ Normal o/~
o/~ You and me o/~

332
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:22,167
o/~ What you're signing up for
is a storm at sea o/~

333
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:26,519
You have no idea
how much I miss you,
Azazel.

334
00:25:27,925 --> 00:25:30,083
I'm so glad
you got back.

335
00:25:30,646 --> 00:25:31,303
I know.

336
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,704
Well, gotta go.

337
00:25:42,897 --> 00:25:44,070
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

338
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:46,193
- You just got here.
- Yep.

339
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,841
I've got something
I need to take care of.

340
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:51,315
What things?

341
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,439
The Redeemer's arrived.

342
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:05,677
Ariel contacted me
a few months ago.

343
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:07,812
Really?

344
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,099
Where is she?

345
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:15,992
Where is she?

346
00:26:22,896 --> 00:26:26,239
She lives in this college town
200 miles from here.

347
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,835
Good, then that's
where I'm going.

348
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:33,512
You know,
your speech has improved,
but your clothes suck.

349
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:35,213
You need real ones.

350
00:26:35,787 --> 00:26:38,591
Angelic robes aren't
as stylish
as they used to be.

351
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:42,356
I'm sure I'll find you
something that fits.

352
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:50,033
Whose are these?

353
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,916
I don't know.
An old boyfriend.
Or a husband, maybe.

354
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,708
You've been locked up
for 5,000 years.

355
00:26:57,471 --> 00:26:58,597
I have my needs.

356
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,667
It's not like fidelity
was ever your strong suit.

357
00:27:06,538 --> 00:27:07,769
Oh, wow, okay.

358
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:12,133
Thanks for letting me
sit in, though.
That was really cool.

359
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,315
It's not a problem.

360
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:16,974
- I don't know, I just kind of thought you might like
to sit in on it.
-
Hey, um...

361
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:20,111
I don't mean to be rude.
Can I just...
Can I catch up with you in,
like, one second?

362
00:27:20,112 --> 00:27:21,070
- Of course.
- Sorry.

363
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:25,035
Excuse me.

364
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:30,302
I just wanted to apologize
for talking out of turn
back there.

365
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:35,998
Not at all.
I admire your passion
on the subject,
Mr. Corbett.

366
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,570
- Correct?
- Yes. Yes.

367
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:41,230
Um, and thank you
for letting me sit in
on your class, Dr. Grasic.

368
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:45,159
So...
are you a religious zealot,

369
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:48,279
or just a die-hard
Milton fan?

370
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,587
Uh, neither.
Um, I've actually

371
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,477
- never read Paradise Lost.
- Shame on you.

372
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:57,961
Anyway, I was thinking about

373
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,008
what you said about Lucifer
and his destiny,
and it goes against...

374
00:28:02,267 --> 00:28:05,153
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I have
no time.

375
00:28:06,103 --> 00:28:09,798
But I spend
most of my evenings
at the library.

376
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:14,140
If you'd like to come by,
I'd be happy to continue
our discussion.

377
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:31,439
Hi.

378
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:34,489
Come here.

379
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,379
- How was work?
- It was great.

380
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,710
I didn't even have
to use my healing magic
on anyone today.

381
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,349
You use your healing magic
on the job?

382
00:28:50,507 --> 00:28:53,686
- Aren't you worried about the Powers?
- Oh, I'm always worried about the Powers.

383
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:57,944
But if I have a chance
at saving a life, to me it's worth it.

384
00:28:58,844 --> 00:29:01,190
Besides,
I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

385
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,061
It's a protective rune.

386
00:29:09,421 --> 00:29:11,521
It's not strong enough
to mask a redemption
but

387
00:29:11,967 --> 00:29:13,597
it's good for
a little interference.

388
00:29:13,984 --> 00:29:15,462
You know, in a pinch.

389
00:29:17,195 --> 00:29:19,025
Keep it.
I've got dozens of them.

390
00:29:20,397 --> 00:29:20,679
Thanks.

391
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:30,879
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

392
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:32,416
What do you mean?

393
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:35,900
By redeeming the Fallen?

394
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,806
I don't know.

395
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:42,762
What do you think?

396
00:29:43,905 --> 00:29:44,515
I don't know.

397
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:51,405
Camael's always drilled it
into my head
that it's my destiny.

398
00:29:52,602 --> 00:29:55,218
But just because
I'm meant to do something,
does that

399
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:57,599
make it
the right thing to do?

400
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:06,949
What if the Earth...
I don't know,
needs angels?

401
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:11,661
And I'm just...
taking them away?

402
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,298
Aaron...

403
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:18,852
this is your mission.

404
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:22,429
Now, whether
it's right or wrong
is for you to decide.

405
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,300
And I think,
until you know,

406
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,393
you should keep your gift
to yourself.

407
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,419
Because what you're doing
is far too important.

408
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:34,930
You have to believe
in it.

409
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,488
That's my two cents.

410
00:30:45,993 --> 00:30:47,060
See your I.D.?

411
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:52,884
- Can you hold these?
- Yeah.

412
00:30:52,966 --> 00:30:53,764
There you go.

413
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:55,957
- You got that?
- Yeah.

414
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:59,320
- You're 21?
- No, but my sister is.

415
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:04,446
One for you. Yep.

416
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:07,051
There you go.
Okay.
You guys ready?

417
00:31:07,052 --> 00:31:11,263
Yeah!
Okay, let's do this!
Woo!
Yep!
Cheers.
Cheers.

418
00:31:18,248 --> 00:31:19,633
Yo, aren't you drinking?

419
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,873
I'm not really much
of a drinker.

420
00:31:23,492 --> 00:31:25,251
He's the designated driver.

421
00:31:25,932 --> 00:31:27,773
Didn't you guys
walk here?
Yeah.

422
00:31:31,418 --> 00:31:33,213
Don't you guys
have classes
in the morning?

423
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,577
Does that make
any difference? Class?
Class?

424
00:31:37,578 --> 00:31:40,801
You guys...
Take one drink!
It's right there!
Come on!

425
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:43,754
One shot won't hurt you.
Man up.
You can't waste
alcohol, man. Man up.

426
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:45,901
Drink it.
Do it! Woo!
Leave it.
Yeah!

427
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,198
Just one shot!
He's got it
right there.
One shot. One shot.

428
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,642
Ooh, you're not
gonna puke, are you?

429
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:02,601
Okay, we're gonna
grab some air.

430
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,984
Ten bucks says
we don't see
either one of them
again tonight.

431
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:16,345
So, how was
your first day
of college?

432
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:19,485
It was great.
Thanks.

433
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:46,733
- Chloe.
- What is it?

434
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:52,185
Just...

435
00:32:54,168 --> 00:32:55,998
You don't want
to get involved with me.

436
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:58,868
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

437
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:05,249
- Nothing.
- Then is something wrong with me?

438
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:09,366
'Cause I've been
practically throwing
myself at you all day.

439
00:33:37,027 --> 00:33:37,649
Aaron!

440
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:44,027
No!

441
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,378
Wait, dude. Chill.

442
00:33:54,379 --> 00:33:56,220
We were just
messing around.

443
00:33:58,284 --> 00:33:58,871
Chloe.

Oh, Mr. Corbett.

454
00:35:25,153 --> 00:35:29,001
- I wasn't sure
you'd still be here.
- The library doesn't close
until midnight.

455
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:33,196
The staff always
has to chase me out.

456
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,393
Yeah.

457
00:35:40,114 --> 00:35:41,815
What can you tell me
about the Nephilim?

458
00:35:50,538 --> 00:35:55,675
It's widely accepted
that the Nephilim
were killed
in the Great Flood.

459
00:35:57,173 --> 00:35:59,730
They were powerful beings,

460
00:35:59,731 --> 00:36:03,238
very often portrayed
as giants.
Monsters.

461
00:36:04,712 --> 00:36:09,615
Have you ever...
heard of a Nephilim
called the Redeemer?

462
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:14,296
I have.

463
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:19,217
I'm surprised that
you know of him, though.

464
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,974
It's quite
an obscure prophecy.
Very controversial.

465
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:32,366
The Redeemer was a vehicle
for forgiveness.

466
00:36:33,136 --> 00:36:39,361
He or she has the power
to pardon anyone
of any sin,

467
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,484
no matter how great.

468
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:48,707
But there are clues
to something else
in the prophecy,

469
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,543
hints that he may serve
another, darker purpose.

470
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,395
What purpose?
We don't know.

471
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:07,164
All we know is
that for every claim
that praises his arrival,

472
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:12,647
there is another
that speaks of it
in terror.

473
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:17,937
We are not even sure
if he is a force of good...

474
00:37:19,171 --> 00:37:20,461
or evil.

475
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:39,748
Aaron.

476
00:37:43,688 --> 00:37:44,216
Ariel.

477
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:47,536
How you feeling?

478
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:56,293
Much better. Thank you.

479
00:37:57,665 --> 00:38:02,299
I'm glad you're up.
I got called in to work,
and somebody's
gotta walk Gabriel.

480
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:06,250
Oh, and I promised him
some ice cream.

481
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,748
Where's Aaron?

482
00:38:09,945 --> 00:38:11,939
He's hanging with
his friends from college.

483
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:13,989
His friends?
Mm-hmm.

484
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:17,848
How long have I been out?

485
00:38:18,622 --> 00:38:22,610
Don't worry.
He's fine.
You can't protect him
all the time, you know?

486
00:38:23,264 --> 00:38:25,411
Yes, I can.
I must.

487
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:29,505
- He's an irresponsible child. And that temper will get someone...
- He's 19,

488
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:32,660
he's a good kid,
and he needs some normalcy
in his life.

489
00:38:33,538 --> 00:38:36,096
You gotta remember,
he's human.

490
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:40,401
Half human.
That's more than you are.

491
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,160
Who are you to talk?

492
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:50,705
The Nephilim are monsters.

493
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:53,801
Why?

494
00:38:55,487 --> 00:38:56,261
What did they do?

495
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:01,540
What is that?

496
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:06,540
It's nothing.

497
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:09,367
Where did you get it?

498
00:39:10,951 --> 00:39:12,488
My friend gave it to me.

499
00:39:14,818 --> 00:39:17,891
What are you doing?
I know what this is.

500
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:23,510
Protective rune
used to hide yourself.

501
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,651
To hide yourself?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

502
00:39:27,003 --> 00:39:30,533
You hide yourself
from angels.

503
00:39:35,595 --> 00:39:39,642
Yes.
It all makes sense now.

504
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,293
I don't know what
you're talking about.

505
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:47,321
Of course you don't.
You never know
who might be listening.

506
00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:50,911
But I know what you are.

507
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:58,483
And I'm just like you.
We are brothers, Aaron.

508
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:01,087
Brothers in the Order.

509
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:05,658
The Order?
Yeah.

510
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,966
I know why you're here.

511
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:12,169
You do?
Yes.

512
00:40:13,182 --> 00:40:17,945
We both know that
the angels are real.

513
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:24,100
We know that
they walk among us.

514
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:33,474
Tell me...
would you like to see one?

515
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:35,949
Yes?

516
00:40:45,495 --> 00:40:47,137
All this
on a teacher's salary?

517
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:53,304
My family
has a long history
of dealing
in ancient artifacts.

518
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,070
What I'm about
to show you,

519
00:41:04,457 --> 00:41:07,777
you can never
breathe a word about,
for your own safety.

520
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,215
You have nothing
to fear from me.

521
00:41:16,118 --> 00:41:20,364
But as I'm sure
you know,
some of our members

522
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,148
are overly cautious.

523
00:41:26,101 --> 00:41:27,990
Do I have your word?

524
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:32,206
Come.

525
00:41:44,415 --> 00:41:47,946
There she is.
Come.

526
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,104
Child?

527
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:59,092
We have a guest.

528
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,854
Show us your wings.

529
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,408
Your beautiful wings.

530
00:42:23,289 --> 00:42:26,902
Breathtaking...isn't it?

531
00:42:28,435 --> 00:42:34,640
Now turn around.
Show us your pretty face.

532
00:42:51,954 --> 00:42:53,913
Isn't she beautiful?

533
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:00,272
Vilma!

534
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,680
How do you know her name?

535
00:43:08,718 --> 00:43:11,525
That's impossible... what is she doing here?

536
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,694
She's quite comfortable here.

537
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,112
I've taken excellent care.

538
00:43:17,657 --> 00:43:18,819
She's a prisoner.

539
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:22,937
She's the only living Nephilim.

540
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:26,691
Would you rather her

541
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:31,235
be strapped to a table in a laboratory somewhere?

542
00:43:32,713 --> 00:43:33,808
I'm taking her out of here.

543
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,148
No.

544
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:38,005
You'll do no such thing

545
00:43:44,988 --> 00:43:47,964
It's time for you to leave my house.

546
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,089
Right now.

547
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:57,094
Lukas...

548
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:00,802
God!

549
00:44:04,424 --> 00:44:06,090
Those markings.

550
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,968
Wipe away those runes.

551
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:30,730
I don't want to.

552
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:31,463
Do it.

553
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,547
Do it now!

554
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:57,608
You are... the Redeemer.

555
00:44:58,668 --> 00:45:00,178
Wipe away those runes.

556
00:45:02,435 --> 00:45:03,065
Do it!

557
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:13,490
Vilma.

558
00:45:15,622 --> 00:45:16,221
It's me.

559
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:20,608
Vilma, it's Aaron.

560
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:22,992
We're going to get out of here.

561
00:45:33,978 --> 00:45:34,966
It's okay.

562
00:45:35,218 --> 00:45:36,195
You're safe now.

563
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:37,947
I promise.

564
00:46:31,832 --> 00:46:32,454
You all right?

565
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:34,288
Yeah.

566
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:35,702
Vilma, say something, please.

567
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:38,713
You're like me.

568
00:46:39,941 --> 00:46:41,163
How is that possible?

569
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:42,362
I don't know.

570
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:43,901
I don't know what the hell's going on.

571
00:46:44,264 --> 00:46:45,093
Aaron!

572
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,653
Camael. It's okay.

573
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:52,055
This is Camael.
He's my friend.

574
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,558
Hey! I rember you.

575
00:46:53,595 --> 00:46:54,653
This girl is Nephilim.

576
00:46:55,364 --> 00:46:56,459
Where did she come from?

577
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,139
It's a long story.

578
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,760
You lost control.

579
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:04,600
The Powers are coming.
You must leave now.

580
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:08,057
No. I'm going to stay,
and I'm going to fight.

581
00:47:08,545 --> 00:47:11,832
If you don't leave now,
they will kill all of us.

582
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,897
And if I do, they'll kill you?

583
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:17,159
I have pledged to lay down my life for you.

584
00:47:17,663 --> 00:47:18,973
That is what I intend to do.

585
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,298
What is going on?

586
00:47:21,602 --> 00:47:24,807
Aaron, you must protect
this child, as you once
need my help.

587
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:27,027
Run!

588
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:36,415
Take care of the traitor.

589
00:47:36,748 --> 00:47:38,192
I'm going after the Nephilim.

590
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:20,156
Well, I'll be damned.

591
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:23,806
Two for the price of one.
It must be my lucky day.

592
00:48:24,812 --> 00:48:26,019
I got to admit, kid.

593
00:48:26,715 --> 00:48:28,321
You gave us a run for our money.

594
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:33,019
But this is how it ends.

595
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:39,763
Leave the children alone, Nathaniel.

596
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:41,969
Azazel.

597
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:46,845
Don't you have some puppies to go kick or something?

598
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:50,444
This can't be you.
This isn't real.

599
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:51,974
Oh, it's real.

600
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:56,519
What could I possibly do to convince you?

601
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,768
Oh. Aren't I?

602
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:20,483
You guys all right?

603
00:49:23,365 --> 00:49:24,490
What, are you scared of me?

604
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:26,548
I just saved your asses.

605
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:02,536
Who are you?

606
00:50:02,995 --> 00:50:03,942
I'm Azazel.

607
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,089
Glad to meet you.

608
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,167
Are you one of the Fallen?

609
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:10,825
I'm Azazel.

610
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:12,928
You never heard of me?

611
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,217
Yeah, I'm one of the Fallen.
I'm the Fallen.

612
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:20,608
Your girl looks a little
freaked out, man.

613
00:50:21,503 --> 00:50:23,834
Yeah, well,
it's been a rough night.

614
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,720
Yeah, well you know what?
It's only going to get worse.

615
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:29,172
We need to get off these streets,
go underground. Let's go.

616
00:50:32,168 --> 00:50:36,099
Let's go! They can smell you.
They can feel you. Come on.

617
00:50:37,442 --> 00:50:38,331
We got to go.

618
00:50:38,486 --> 00:50:41,372
Aaron. He just killed that man.

619
00:50:41,528 --> 00:50:43,674
Vilma, I know what you're
going through right now.

620
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:46,266
But he's one of the Fallen.
He's on our side.

621
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,376
On our side?

622
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,474
Whose side are we on?
Are we the good guys
or the bad guys?

623
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:56,450
If we survive this night, I promise you
I will tell you everything I know.

624
00:50:57,475 --> 00:50:58,674
But right now,
we've got to go.

625
00:50:59,714 --> 00:51:00,143
Okay?

626
00:51:01,742 --> 00:51:02,601
- Yeah.
- Okay.

627
00:51:21,941 --> 00:51:23,155
Hey, could I ask
you something?

628
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,562
How did you end up
in that nutjob's attic?

629
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,088
Well, it all started
on my 18th birthday.

630
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:39,223
Strange things started
happening to me.

631
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:41,691
I was getting these headaches,

632
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,977
and I was hearing voices.

633
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,166
And then...
And the angels came.

634
00:51:50,613 --> 00:51:53,048
They're so majestic
at first, you know.

635
00:51:53,552 --> 00:51:54,625
So beautiful.

636
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:57,294
Real angels from Heaven.

637
00:52:00,157 --> 00:52:01,045
Then they attacked.

638
00:52:04,176 --> 00:52:05,449
They killed my aunt.

639
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:07,808
Burned down the house.

640
00:52:09,214 --> 00:52:10,510
Somehow, I got away.

641
00:52:11,689 --> 00:52:13,184
The angels who did that
to you,

642
00:52:14,154 --> 00:52:15,509
they're calledthe Powers.

643
00:52:17,441 --> 00:52:18,973
They are the same angels

644
00:52:20,105 --> 00:52:22,504
that are chasing us right now.

645
00:52:22,992 --> 00:52:25,168
I just ran.
Hid in the woods.

646
00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:28,241
I thought I was dead,
for sure.

647
00:52:28,641 --> 00:52:32,549
I stopped this man in the woods
and asked him for help, but...

648
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:36,302
he pulled out a gun
and shot me with a tranquilizer.

649
00:52:37,421 --> 00:52:40,352
Lukas didn't hurt me or
anything, though, he, uh...

650
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,662
He was kind.

651
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:47,835
You probably won't understand.
It's not like I had anywhere else to go.

652
00:52:50,278 --> 00:52:51,327
Until you came.

653
00:52:53,108 --> 00:52:56,316
So, thanks for coming
to my rescue.

654
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:01,595
Maybe you can tell me now why angels
are trying to kill us?

655
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:02,821
What did we do?

656
00:53:03,857 --> 00:53:05,802
It's because we were
born Nephilim.

657
00:53:07,192 --> 00:53:10,552
They're on a mission from
the Creator to cleanse
the Earth of...

658
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:13,962
our kind.
We're abominations.

659
00:53:15,697 --> 00:53:16,809
Abominations.

660
00:53:17,137 --> 00:53:20,800
Yeah, you're freaks. It sucks.
Can we all stop feeling sorry for ourselves now?

661
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,026
We're alive,

662
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,729
which is more than can
be said for Nathaniel.

663
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:26,416
Hey, listen. Um...

664
00:53:27,225 --> 00:53:29,574
I want to thank you
for what you did back there.

665
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,113
If you hadn't shown up,
we might have been...

666
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:33,169
Hey.
You're the Redeemer.

667
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:35,576
What kind of Fallen would I be
if I didn't look out for you?

668
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:40,361
Hey, we got to find out
what happened to Camael.

669
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,797
Camael? Ah, I wouldn't
worry about him.

670
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:45,625
What do you mean?

671
00:53:46,636 --> 00:53:47,457
Camael's dead.

672
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,052
I can't believe
Camael's dead.

673
00:54:06,946 --> 00:54:08,184
What is the big deal?

674
00:54:09,106 --> 00:54:12,011
So Camael's troops finally turned on him.
That's a good thing.

675
00:54:13,565 --> 00:54:15,624
He wasn't with the Powers anymore.
He...

676
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:19,885
He's been protecting me,

677
00:54:20,744 --> 00:54:22,108
ever since I turned.

678
00:54:25,468 --> 00:54:27,009
He was my friend.

679
00:54:27,881 --> 00:54:28,815
Your friend?

680
00:54:29,775 --> 00:54:31,569
We are talking about
the same Camael, right?

681
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,190
Tall, bald,
no sense of humor?

682
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:44,005
This is all my fault.

683
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:47,036
No, Aaron,

684
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:48,855
you were trying
to help me.

685
00:54:49,247 --> 00:54:51,280
That's what Camael
would've wanted.

686
00:54:52,821 --> 00:54:54,413
I didn't have to
do it like that.

687
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,255
I lost control.

688
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:03,927
And I don't know
what we're going
to do now.

689
00:55:06,465 --> 00:55:08,171
Look, I've got an idea.

690
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,115
Why don't we get
out of town?

691
00:55:15,454 --> 00:55:16,629
Lay low for a while.

692
00:55:18,183 --> 00:55:20,014
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

693
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,515
Where is that?

694
00:55:25,048 --> 00:55:27,460
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

695
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:32,892
It's about time
you met him.

696
00:55:48,502 --> 00:55:51,167
Hey!
Don't move!
Stay right there!

697
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:52,241
Don't move!

698
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:54,565
Get back here!

699
00:55:54,982 --> 00:55:56,801
Come back here and get down on your knees!

700
00:55:57,167 --> 00:55:58,822
Give me your wallet.
Your wallet! All right.

701
00:55:59,403 --> 00:56:00,325
Hurry up!
All right!

702
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:03,319
And your watch.
Your watch, too!
Hurry!
Come on!

703
00:56:22,617 --> 00:56:25,421
It's not nice
to steal from people.

704
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:35,220
Hey.

705
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:37,772
What is wrong with you?

706
00:56:38,113 --> 00:56:39,351
It's kinda harsh, isn't it?

707
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:43,633
I'm not a guardian angel.

708
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,756
I'm an avenging angel.

709
00:56:47,577 --> 00:56:48,777
This is who I am.

710
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:51,480
The world needs both.

711
00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:55,651
Got us a car.
Wanna drive?

712
00:56:57,975 --> 00:57:00,249
We're not seriously going
off with this guy, are we?

713
00:57:03,773 --> 00:57:05,087
He can protect us.

714
00:57:06,578 --> 00:57:07,323
We need him.

715
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:09,975
We need somebody.

716
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:13,052
Any day now.

717
00:57:18,812 --> 00:57:19,570
Just hold on.

718
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:27,126
What is the Light Bringer?

719
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:28,958
Not what. Who.

720
00:57:29,602 --> 00:57:31,320
He's a fallen angel,
just like me.

721
00:57:32,995 --> 00:57:34,877
And his name
is the Light Bringer?

722
00:57:35,155 --> 00:57:36,279
Is your name the Redeemer?

723
00:57:36,835 --> 00:57:37,630
Don't be an idiot.

724
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:42,303
He doesn't have a name
in a traditional sense.

725
00:57:42,922 --> 00:57:45,448
We call him "the Light Bringer"
because that's what he does.

726
00:57:45,651 --> 00:57:49,844
He brings us light.
He's an oracle. He's a seer.

727
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:53,070
Are you sure
that he can help us?

728
00:57:54,473 --> 00:57:56,557
He can't help me,
but he can help you.

729
00:57:57,251 --> 00:57:59,891
Remember that prophecY about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

730
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,178
He wrote it.

731
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:34,601
You'll find that
quite impossible, traitor.

732
00:58:40,045 --> 00:58:40,778
Aaron?

733
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:45,426
I suspect we'll have him
or his remains within the hour.

734
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:49,329
He can't last long
without your protection.

735
00:58:51,812 --> 00:58:52,785
Mazarin.

736
00:58:55,159 --> 00:58:58,153
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

737
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,715
The prophecy is real.

738
00:59:02,346 --> 00:59:04,810
No, Camael.
It's a lie.

739
00:59:06,375 --> 00:59:08,965
I do hope Nathaniel
brings the boy back alive.

740
00:59:10,152 --> 00:59:12,678
I'd love to make you watch
while I slit his throat

741
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:14,725
so that when you die,

742
00:59:15,483 --> 00:59:18,186
you'll know for certain
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

743
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:23,285
Mazarin.

744
00:59:25,218 --> 00:59:27,479
This is not what
the Powers stand for.

745
00:59:28,376 --> 00:59:31,407
You dare tell me
the Powers' mission?

746
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:34,995
Are you under the misconception
that you're still one of us?

747
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,012
You turned your back on us, Camael.
You turned your back on the Creator.

748
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:42,435
And you'll pay
for your sins, traitor.

749
00:59:48,545 --> 00:59:50,199
What I want to know is...

750
00:59:51,905 --> 00:59:55,968
what in the hell were you thinking
showing her to anyone?

751
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,905
But he was Nephilim.

752
01:00:00,535 --> 01:00:03,453
You didn't know that
when you brought him
up here, did you?

753
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:06,055
I thought
he was one of us.

754
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:09,516
Oh, right.
Of course.

755
01:00:11,335 --> 01:00:15,541
Because the Order is just teeming
with teenage members, isn't it?

756
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:19,763
Please, put that down.

757
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:22,896
It's 4th century.

758
01:00:23,073 --> 01:00:24,285
Really?

759
01:00:25,458 --> 01:00:26,670
It's exquisite.

760
01:00:32,481 --> 01:00:35,866
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that precious to you?

761
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:38,209
What about this?

762
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,982
Haven't I lost
enough tonight?

763
01:00:45,662 --> 01:00:48,643
It's not about what you've lost,
Dr. Grasic.

764
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,218
You've lost nothing.
We let you keep her.

765
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:55,058
She was never yours.He's the Redeemer!

766
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,283
What?

767
01:01:02,024 --> 01:01:03,043
Yes.

768
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:13,698
The boy who freed her...

769
01:01:16,536 --> 01:01:20,702
he has the markings
of the Redeemer.

770
01:01:33,464 --> 01:01:35,316
Start from the beginning.

771
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:40,768
Is that look in your eye
meant to intimidate me?

772
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:46,083
Now, I admit there was a time
when it might have,

773
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:49,179
but those days are over,
old friend.

774
01:01:50,568 --> 01:01:51,364
Mazarin.

775
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:53,272
What is it, Sachael?

776
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:55,423
It's Nathaniel.

777
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,892
He's not coming back.
He's dead.

778
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:16,285
That half-breed
killed Nathaniel?

779
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:18,548
Somebody did.

780
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:32,942
Where is he now, Camael?
Tell me.

781
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:41,344
You know,
over the millennia
we served together,

782
01:02:42,474 --> 01:02:45,418
many of the Fallen
said they would never
give up their children.

783
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,271
But they always did,
thanks to us.

784
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:52,882
No, thanks to you.

785
01:02:55,031 --> 01:02:56,475
Where is the Nephilim?

786
01:03:30,444 --> 01:03:32,944
So who is this
Jesus character anyway?

787
01:03:36,188 --> 01:03:38,003
Seriously, I've been
seeing his name everywhere.

788
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:49,275
Well, um, a lot of people
think that he was the son of God.

789
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:55,479
What's so funny?

790
01:03:57,886 --> 01:03:59,886
The Creator had a kid.

791
01:04:00,593 --> 01:04:02,538
Well, do as I say,
not as I do, eh?

792
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,149
Did you seriously
not know that?

793
01:04:07,393 --> 01:04:09,060
Been out of the picture
for a while.

794
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:13,227
How so?

795
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:16,786
Well, you probably heard
about what happened
in the old days.

796
01:04:17,175 --> 01:04:20,318
About how the Creator
flooded the planet
because we contaminated

797
01:04:20,332 --> 01:04:22,464
his precious Earth
with half-breeds like you.

798
01:04:23,263 --> 01:04:24,955
A bit of an overreaction,
if you ask me.

799
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:27,192
But, hey, mysterious ways
and all that.

800
01:04:28,203 --> 01:04:31,415
Wait. You mean,
like, Noah's Ark?

801
01:04:32,362 --> 01:04:33,054
That flood?

802
01:04:33,727 --> 01:04:34,617
Yeah, that's right.

803
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:35,921
Noah.

804
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:39,941
That guy could
really throw it down,
let me tell you.

805
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,755
Anyways.

806
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:47,345
Afterwards, your buddy Camael

807
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,068
and a few other half-wits
from the Powers

808
01:04:50,084 --> 01:04:52,661
decided they were going
to come down and tell us
things had to change.

809
01:04:54,001 --> 01:04:55,243
I guess to prove
a point,

810
01:04:56,258 --> 01:04:58,240
they decided to make
an example of someone.

811
01:05:01,074 --> 01:05:02,124
I fought.

812
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:05,600
Killed one of them.

813
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:09,371
Slashed this son of a bitch
Mazarin across the face.

814
01:05:09,379 --> 01:05:10,730
It was beautiful.

815
01:05:12,531 --> 01:05:13,915
But in the end,

816
01:05:14,773 --> 01:05:15,718
they got me.

817
01:05:17,906 --> 01:05:19,759
Took me deep underground,

818
01:05:20,348 --> 01:05:21,355
chained me up,

819
01:05:22,338 --> 01:05:25,383
and left me for 5,000 years.

820
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,307
So you've been a prisoner, too.
Like me.

821
01:05:31,521 --> 01:05:31,873
Yeah.

822
01:05:34,341 --> 01:05:36,626
Six months
in a luxury suite...

823
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:40,442
just like being chained
to a stone slab
for five millennia.

824
01:05:40,986 --> 01:05:42,086
Just like it.

825
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:45,374
Don't talk to her
like that.

826
01:05:45,769 --> 01:05:46,405
Or what?

827
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,793
I'm just messin'
with you, kid.

828
01:05:53,912 --> 01:05:55,147
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

829
01:05:55,459 --> 01:05:57,843
I'm sure it must've been
very difficult for you.

830
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:00,599
I smell food.

831
01:06:00,988 --> 01:06:01,846
What about food?

832
01:06:02,027 --> 01:06:03,528
Who wants to eat?
Want to stop for a bite?

833
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:05,933
Well, we're kind of
on the run right now.

834
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:06,625
You gotta eat.

835
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:09,889
I'm hungry. Who's hungry?
Let's vote.

836
01:06:10,922 --> 01:06:11,737
Me! I'm hungry!

837
01:06:12,188 --> 01:06:13,089
Me, too.

838
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:15,111
I'm starving.

839
01:06:16,568 --> 01:06:17,903
Looks like you lose, chief.

840
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,611
All right, order up.

841
01:06:28,129 --> 01:06:30,536
Oh... my... God.

842
01:06:35,511 --> 01:06:37,122
What are these things
called again?

843
01:06:38,585 --> 01:06:41,437
What?
French fries?

844
01:06:42,366 --> 01:06:44,200
French fries.
I gotta remember that.

845
01:06:44,829 --> 01:06:47,533
Here, try 'em with ketchup.

846
01:06:59,654 --> 01:07:04,820
This is the best food
I've ever had
in the history of ever!

847
01:07:04,894 --> 01:07:07,524
Hey, we get it.
You like French fries.

848
01:07:10,101 --> 01:07:11,861
This is the first meal
I've had in a long time.

849
01:07:11,935 --> 01:07:15,138
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna enjoy it.
All right?

850
01:07:15,619 --> 01:07:18,619
And lighten up...
Redeemer.

851
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:23,711
Why does he keep
calling you that?
Redeemer?

852
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:25,119
'Cause that's what he is.

853
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:28,778
He sends us Fallen
back to Heaven.
Show her your arms.

854
01:07:30,704 --> 01:07:31,982
Show her your arms.

855
01:07:39,804 --> 01:07:41,656
The names of the Redeemed.

856
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,434
These are all angels?

857
01:07:49,124 --> 01:07:50,846
And you send them
back to Heaven?

858
01:07:52,753 --> 01:07:53,698
How?

859
01:07:55,809 --> 01:07:56,790
I don't know.

860
01:07:59,331 --> 01:08:03,146
Um... When I'm around them,
I get this, um...

861
01:08:04,427 --> 01:08:06,724
this weird feeling.

862
01:08:07,764 --> 01:08:09,820
It's hard to explain, really.
Um...

863
01:08:11,616 --> 01:08:12,727
I kinda...

864
01:08:14,783 --> 01:08:16,486
open myself up to them.

865
01:08:18,949 --> 01:08:23,023
And then I usually...
take their hand and, uh...

866
01:08:25,916 --> 01:08:28,305
this weird energy
passes between us.

867
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:35,385
And then they're gone.

868
01:08:40,657 --> 01:08:42,417
Wow. Um...

869
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:44,676
Do it to him.

870
01:08:45,361 --> 01:08:47,972
What?
No, you keep that voodoo to yourself.

871
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:49,935
Don't you want
to go to Heaven?

872
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:51,110
Hell, no.

873
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:54,296
If I liked it,
I wouldn't have rebelled
in the first place,
would I?

874
01:08:56,184 --> 01:08:58,518
Yeah, well, I'm not
really doing it anymore.

875
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:01,780
Not right now.

876
01:09:03,151 --> 01:09:04,188
Why not?

877
01:09:04,303 --> 01:09:07,969
There's just a lot I...
I still don't understand about it.

878
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,006
Plus, I'm not even sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

879
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:18,232
Aaron, how can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

880
01:09:20,102 --> 01:09:20,899
I don't know.

881
01:09:24,161 --> 01:09:25,809
But I've been having these...

882
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:29,791
these weird dreams lately

883
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:32,705
about the end
of the world...

884
01:09:36,946 --> 01:09:38,187
and I'm the cause of it.

885
01:09:40,524 --> 01:09:42,635
Damn, kid, you're a mess,
ain't you?

886
01:09:45,861 --> 01:09:46,713
Look at me.

887
01:09:48,994 --> 01:09:51,865
Look at me.
When we get
to the Light Bringer,

888
01:09:52,031 --> 01:09:56,142
I promise you'll understand
yourself and your destiny

889
01:09:56,588 --> 01:09:58,347
a hell of a lot better.

890
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:01,162
More coffee?

891
01:10:03,273 --> 01:10:05,014
Hello, sweetheart.
What's your name?

892
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,031
Suzie.

893
01:10:08,846 --> 01:10:12,216
Suzie.
That's such a pretty name.

894
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:15,234
Saw you looking
at me earlier, Suzie.

895
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,646
No, no. Don't be embarrassed.
Sometimes I can't stop looking at me.

896
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:23,331
Let me ask you
a question, Suzie.

897
01:10:26,067 --> 01:10:28,975
Is there anywhere near here

898
01:10:30,197 --> 01:10:31,938
where you and I
could go, um...

899
01:10:33,234 --> 01:10:34,012
talk?

900
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:43,230
I'm going on a break.

901
01:10:43,582 --> 01:10:44,878
Yeah, all right.

902
01:10:47,338 --> 01:10:49,319
Catch you losers later.

903
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:21,523
I've told you
everything I know.

904
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:30,958
Hawkins.

905
01:11:32,606 --> 01:11:34,532
No. No teams.

906
01:11:35,236 --> 01:11:36,458
I hunt alone.

907
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:44,992
What do you want me
to do about the girl?

908
01:11:48,232 --> 01:11:49,362
Understood.

909
01:12:05,526 --> 01:12:08,581
Are you going to get
my Vilma back?

910
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:20,517
Go on.

911
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:22,776
I don't care.

912
01:12:25,095 --> 01:12:28,187
I don't want to live
without her anyway.

913
01:12:36,855 --> 01:12:39,078
Do you believe
that things happen
for a reason?

914
01:12:41,744 --> 01:12:42,744
You mean, like fate?

915
01:12:44,118 --> 01:12:47,396
There's really
no other explanation
for all this, is there?

916
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,655
You and me?

917
01:12:50,547 --> 01:12:53,918
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

918
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,537
Everything makes
so much sense now.

919
01:13:02,667 --> 01:13:06,796
The day you left,
people said you'd gone crazy

920
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,111
- and burned your house down.
- People said that?

921
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,066
About me?

922
01:13:22,786 --> 01:13:24,564
You ever think
about going home?

923
01:13:26,951 --> 01:13:28,006
Yeah.

924
01:13:29,414 --> 01:13:30,562
All the time.

925
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:35,562
It's been a year now
and I just...

926
01:13:37,028 --> 01:13:41,436
I feel like I keep getting
further and further away.
You know?

927
01:13:42,235 --> 01:13:45,809
At least you have a family to go back to.
Someday.

928
01:13:49,313 --> 01:13:52,331
I wonder if this Light Bringer
knows anything about me.

929
01:13:52,977 --> 01:13:57,236
You know, maybe...
maybe I have a prophecy, too.

930
01:13:58,921 --> 01:14:00,440
Don't jinx yourself.

931
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:02,143
Still got it.

932
01:14:06,195 --> 01:14:07,770
It's almost too easy,
isn't it?

933
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:11,547
Mortal wenches.
God bless 'em.

934
01:14:12,236 --> 01:14:15,514
You know, you really
shouldn't say that stuff.

935
01:14:16,569 --> 01:14:17,199
Why?

936
01:14:18,406 --> 01:14:20,591
Because it's derogatory
towards women.

937
01:14:22,554 --> 01:14:24,684
No, but I'm saying that
I like that they're easy.

938
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,248
Weird.

939
01:14:29,655 --> 01:14:30,766
You kids ready to go?

940
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:33,655
Come on, Gabe.

941
01:14:34,988 --> 01:14:36,859
I'm riding in back
with Azazel.

942
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:42,186
What is it?

943
01:14:45,519 --> 01:14:47,631
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head over.

944
01:14:48,615 --> 01:14:49,819
Let's go.

945
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:09,244
The aerospace manufacturer
pleaded guilty to two counts

946
01:15:09,307 --> 01:15:11,308
of violating the Federal
Clean Water Act,

947
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:14,135
admitting dumping
industrial discharge
into the river.

948
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:17,137
In addition to being placed
on probation for five years,

949
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:19,863
the company agreed to pay
$1 million in fines

950
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:23,036
and to contribute
another $11 million
for environmental
improvement projects.

951
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:25,839
Good God,
what is happening
to this place?

952
01:15:25,966 --> 01:15:29,005
Human beings used to care
about the Earth, you know?

953
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:31,506
They used to appreciate
just how good they had it.

954
01:15:31,992 --> 01:15:34,419
Guess a lot has changed
in 5,000 years.

955
01:15:41,930 --> 01:15:44,227
Will this Light Bringer
know who my father is?

956
01:15:46,006 --> 01:15:47,673
You sure that's something
you want to find out?

957
01:15:49,549 --> 01:15:51,902
Most Nephilim don't
want anything to do
with their fathers.

958
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:55,182
Human women can't
survive the births.

959
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:59,532
At first, we were like,
whoops, you know?

960
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,182
But it didn't take us long
to figure out that, you know,

961
01:16:02,386 --> 01:16:05,535
getting one pregnant
was like handing down
a death sentence.

962
01:16:06,503 --> 01:16:08,986
So they all die?
All our mothers?

963
01:16:09,709 --> 01:16:11,080
Every one of 'em.

964
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:15,546
Your old man still sound
like someone you wanna
go fishing with?

965
01:16:16,269 --> 01:16:17,677
Play catch?

966
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:19,270
I just want to know
who he is.

967
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,332
We're being followed.

968
01:16:23,443 --> 01:16:24,184
What?

969
01:16:25,444 --> 01:16:26,667
By who?

970
01:16:27,297 --> 01:16:28,298
I don't know.

971
01:16:28,913 --> 01:16:30,896
Pull over.
Let me deal with it.

972
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:36,625
It's time, traitor.

973
01:16:37,422 --> 01:16:40,020
Time for you to say good-bye
to something you hold dear.

974
01:16:43,429 --> 01:16:45,041
Perhaps your eyes.

975
01:16:46,157 --> 01:16:49,770
No. There's a certain
nobility in blindness.

976
01:16:50,585 --> 01:16:54,124
I could cut out your tongue,
but then once you're broken,

977
01:16:54,554 --> 01:16:57,093
you wouldn't
be able to tell me
what I want to know.

978
01:16:58,315 --> 01:16:59,260
Sachael.

979
01:17:00,228 --> 01:17:01,506
I want to see his wings.

980
01:17:01,536 --> 01:17:03,092
Mazarin, no.
You can't...

981
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,198
That wasn't a request.

982
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:06,088
Just do it.

983
01:17:08,516 --> 01:17:09,250
Mazarin.

984
01:17:10,933 --> 01:17:12,506
You are lost.

985
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:17,673
You do not serve
the Creator.

986
01:17:24,126 --> 01:17:25,124
Mazarin.

987
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:42,187
Mazarin.

988
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,963
You are the one who's lost.

989
01:17:48,499 --> 01:17:49,775
And as for the Creator...

990
01:17:50,682 --> 01:17:53,809
what I do now,
I do in his name.

991
01:18:01,495 --> 01:18:05,399
And now, you take
your true place
amongst the Fallen.

992
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:30,523
Looking for something?

993
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:33,372
Anane.

994
01:18:39,827 --> 01:18:41,732
I picked up your scent
just outside of town,

995
01:18:42,398 --> 01:18:44,155
and I've been following you
ever since.

996
01:18:47,375 --> 01:18:48,651
How did you escape?

997
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:51,912
I am so sick of everybody
asking me that question.

998
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,010
Maybe I didn't escape.

999
01:18:53,651 --> 01:18:56,999
Maybe the Creator decided
I was such a perfect specimen
he'd set me free.

1000
01:18:57,698 --> 01:18:58,475
Did he?

1001
01:19:00,491 --> 01:19:02,489
That's not the point.
What do you want?

1002
01:19:04,081 --> 01:19:05,912
I want to know
if I'm worthy
of redemption.

1003
01:19:06,472 --> 01:19:09,303
I can tell that
you want it really bad.

1004
01:19:10,745 --> 01:19:13,409
But I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that right now.

1005
01:19:16,572 --> 01:19:17,422
I see.

1006
01:19:19,532 --> 01:19:21,178
It's nothing personal, okay?

1007
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:22,084
I just...

1008
01:19:24,808 --> 01:19:26,584
I don't know
how much time
I have left.

1009
01:19:31,547 --> 01:19:32,934
Nathaniel did this to me.

1010
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:35,376
He was looking for you.

1011
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:41,333
It's too late for me
to be healed.

1012
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:44,858
The wound is too old,
too deep.

1013
01:19:45,913 --> 01:19:47,208
It's killing me.

1014
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:51,130
You know what happens
to angels when they die
without redemption?

1015
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:55,371
We don't have souls.
Not like you do.

1016
01:19:57,022 --> 01:19:59,297
There's...
There's no Heaven for us.

1017
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,258
No Hell.
Just...

1018
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:03,630
Just nothingness.

1019
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:05,887
Forever.

1020
01:20:09,092 --> 01:20:11,090
And that scares me
more than anything.

1021
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:13,644
Yeah, well,
tough luck, Anane.

1022
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:15,887
Welcome to the yawning
abyss of oblivion.

1023
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:28,440
Aaron.

1024
01:20:30,068 --> 01:20:33,121
You have to help him.
Please?

1025
01:20:34,693 --> 01:20:36,043
I want to.

1026
01:20:37,653 --> 01:20:39,761
I really do.
It's just that...

1027
01:20:40,779 --> 01:20:43,795
Ariel told me not to
until I know
it's the right thing.

1028
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:48,614
He wants to go back to Heaven
and you can do that for him.

1029
01:20:49,798 --> 01:20:51,537
How can you refuse?

1030
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:54,682
Look in your heart.
You know it's right.

1031
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:02,829
Wait a second.
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

1032
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:07,330
With that amount of energy,
you're just going to call
the Powers right to us.

1033
01:21:07,552 --> 01:21:08,607
I know that.

1034
01:21:12,349 --> 01:21:14,551
But Vilma's right.
I can't just...

1035
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:16,586
let him die.

1036
01:21:17,659 --> 01:21:19,231
Aaron, don't.

1037
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:32,062
You ready?

1038
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,242
Yeah.

1039
01:22:11,084 --> 01:22:12,638
Stay with the traitor.

1040
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:13,822
Sachael.

1041
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,272
You.

1042
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:29,757
I need your help.

1043
01:22:44,716 --> 01:22:46,529
Fantastic!

1044
01:22:47,953 --> 01:22:50,655
You are a genius
of epic proportions,
my friend.

1045
01:22:51,399 --> 01:22:53,323
That was great. Yeah.
'Cause, uh...

1046
01:22:53,545 --> 01:22:54,858
we got away

1047
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:57,374
and it was plain sailing
the whole time.

1048
01:22:57,485 --> 01:23:01,122
But now it's brilliant
because they know
exactly where we are.

1049
01:23:01,467 --> 01:23:03,373
I'm really proud of you.
Well done.

1050
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:05,741
Look, just shut up,
all right?

1051
01:23:05,925 --> 01:23:07,868
Hey, I'm trying
to look out for you.

1052
01:23:08,815 --> 01:23:09,944
Trying to keep you alive.

1053
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:12,633
The rest of the Fallen
will be plenty pissed with me

1054
01:23:12,676 --> 01:23:14,304
if you died on my watch.

1055
01:23:15,617 --> 01:23:16,765
I'm just saying...

1056
01:23:17,985 --> 01:23:19,669
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.

1057
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:21,094
You?

1058
01:23:22,926 --> 01:23:24,406
I'm not afraid of anything.

1059
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:27,532
Well, that's good.

1060
01:23:29,997 --> 01:23:31,348
Because here they come.

1061
01:23:36,569 --> 01:23:38,215
I'm gonna put
an end to this.

1062
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:40,903
I'm not running
from them anymore.

1063
01:23:44,049 --> 01:23:52,049

1
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:36,293
Hey, you. Come on. I've seen
that sleepin' act before.

2
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,694
You know your ticket
ran out the last stop.

3
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,328
- How much to San Francisco?
- 2.25.

4
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,759
Yes. Three days.

5
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,662
<i>So it's three days she's gone.</i>

6
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:51,225
<i>Where do you get off keepin' it</i>
<i>from the police 72 hours?</i>

7
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,738
I didn't want it to get around,
Mr. Johnson. That's all.

8
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,106
People talk.
Stella's a good girl. Really she is.

9
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,270
I don't want them
to talk.

10
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,507
Well, we'll find
what took her.

11
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:06,881
Why not give her till morning, Johnson?
Stella'll show up.

12
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:12,549
Okay, till morning. You oughta know,
Mr. Judd. Good night.

13
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,957
- Night, Johnson.
- Good night.

14
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:19,191
- Way down this week, Pop.
- <i>Nobody plays it with Stella not around.</i>

15
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,460
Yeah, I guess not.

16
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,036
You don't think she might
have done something to herself?

17
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:29,803
Not Stella. Back in New York,
I handled 31 suicide cases personally.

18
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,243
Everything from poison to jumping
in front of the Flatbush subway.

19
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,248
Stella's not the type.

20
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,409
- Here's your receipt.
- Thanks, Atkins.

21
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,987
I'll be seeing you.

22
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,249
Cup of coffee, please.

23
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,416
<i>It's after 10:00.</i>
<i>We're closed up.</i>

24
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,086
And a hamburger, well-done,
with onions, mustard, relish--

25
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,096
What else you want on that hamburger,
the whole state of California?

26
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,167
- What's the population?
- I'll fix you something.

27
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,704
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. Never touch them.

28
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,698
I knew you'd be back.

29
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,712
Okay. I'm back.

30
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,679
<i>Well, here you are,</i>
<i>young man.</i>

31
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,717
Stella. You--

32
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,554
- You're okay?
- I'm hungry.

33
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:56,151
Right away, Stella.
Right away.

34
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,526
You don't know what
it's been like since you went.

35
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,361
You won't go away, Stella,
will you, again?

36
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,526
Well, see you tomorrow.

37
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,366
The room's waiting for you.
I paid 'em not to touch a thing.

38
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,373
You wanted it like that, didn't you, Stella?

39
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,000
And you'll come back
to your job here.

40
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:16,207
Everything just like it was,
as if you'd never been away?

41
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:22,016
That's just how it'll be,
after a long rest.

42
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:26,023
- You sure look run out.
- So what?

43
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,060
One look at him and I knew
he wasn't any good. I knew--

44
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,393
You make me sick.

45
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,433
He's finished
his coffee. Go on.

46
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,594
It was the best hamburger
I never ate.

47
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,606
Sorry. Come back later--
I mean tomorrow. I'm closing up.

48
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,006
- How much?
- It's okay.

49
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,012
It's not okay. He got his coffee.
Let him pay for it.

50
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:50,173
Five cents.

51
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,885
- Good evening.
- Uh-huh.

52
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:40,557
- Professor Madley, please.
- Professor Madley?
He won't be here till tomorrow.

53
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,964
- Oh.
- Maybe Mr. Ellis could help you.

54
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,807
- Ellis?
- The professor's assistant.
He registered this morning.

55
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,002
Oh, Ellis. Oh, yes.
Uh, what's his room number?

56
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,680
It's 216,
but he's not in just now.

57
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,481
Of course.
He's getting tuned.

58
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,646
- Tuned?
- To the other world.

59
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,192
- He always does that
before the professor comes in.
- Is that so?

60
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,921
Oh, sure. Well, I'll wait
for Ellis up in his room.

61
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,657
- But that's against the rules.
- Don't worry. It's all right.

62
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,494
Oh. Mr. Ellis,
I presume.

63
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,620
Yes.

64
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:49,297
My name is Stanton.
Eric Stanton.

65
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:53,031
- Never heard of you.
- Professor Madley's an old friend of mine.

66
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,198
- When was that?
- The good old days.

67
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:58,402
- How old?
- Old enough to be good.

68
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:02,743
- Oh. Drink?
- My favorite brand.

69
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,216
Oughta be. I got it
out of your bureau drawer.

70
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,378
Huh. Help yourself to
everything in here...

71
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,582
long as you're a friend
of the professor's.

72
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,558
- From my cradle days.
- Then you'll do the professor a favor.

73
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,390
- Lend-lease him $30.
- $30?

74
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,931
Do him half a favor-- 15.

75
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:24,059
What's so funny? Tell me.
I'd like to laugh too.

76
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,195
I came up to put
the bite on you.

77
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,671
Now let's hear
how you laugh.

78
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,833
- You can't sleep here.
- Wait a minute.

79
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,911
Consult the spirit of
my friend the professor.

80
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,537
- What's he say?
- I know what the manager says:

81
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,584
One more guest, one more dollar.
I haven't got enough to pay my own bill.

82
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,744
Then the extra dollar
wouldn't matter.

83
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,017
Don't take your shoes off.
I've enough to aggravate me.

84
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:50,858
- Don't worry. I'll get you out of it.
- What with? You're broke.

85
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,363
I've gotta have $15
by noon tomorrow...

86
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,525
or lose the hall downstairs
and my deposit...

87
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,899
besides being kicked out of here
and my luggage held.

88
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,063
What about
the professor's spooks?

89
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,640
Don't they generally come through
with an advance sale?

90
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,801
Sure, when there's nobody
to stop them...

91
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,937
but there's a certain woman in this town
who doesn't believe in spooks.

92
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,106
What she says goes
for the rest of the women.

93
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,275
She's not only the daughter
of the former mayor...

94
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,615
who donated a new organ
to the church...

95
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,280
but the president
of the ladies' auxiliary.

96
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,121
Against such a combination,
not even I could sell one ticket.

97
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,286
Go charm her.

98
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,763
Miss Mills'll have no truck with me,
not even on the phone.

99
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,596
- Well, let's sleep on it.
- I said no.

100
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,138
We're in this thing together.
Naturally, I'll sleep here.

101
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,764
- Stands to reason.
- What stands to reason?

102
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,504
You're in trouble, man.
I've got to pull you out of it.

103
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,241
- You got any toothpaste?
- In the bathroom.

104
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,909
Hope you like my brand.

105
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,694
Good morning.

106
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,427
- Your mistress, please.
- Who?

107
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,835
Miss Clara Mills.

108
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,305
I'm Clara Mills, and we're
not buying anything either.

109
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,467
Miss Mills, I'm here to speak
on behalf of the dead.

110
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,636
- Who?
- Walton's respected deceased.

111
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,647
They're having a rendezvous
tonight at the Walton Hotel at 8:00.

112
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,217
There's nothing to discuss.
I told you that over the phone.

113
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,377
Now please don't call again,
Mr. Ellis.

114
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,217
I'm not Mr. Ellis, and I'm not a part of
the spook act down at the hotel.

115
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,814
I'm Eric Stanton.
Now, would you listen to me for a minute?

116
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:28,985
Well, out with it.
I'm busy.

117
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,154
<i>So is Professor Madley.</i>

118
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,322
<i>Appointments with the dead</i>
<i>from coast to coast...</i>

119
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,491
<i>yet this soul of generosity</i>
<i>finds time...</i>

120
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,660
<i>to drop in on Walton</i>
<i>to deliver a message of hope.</i>

121
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,829
<i>For money.</i>
<i>He's a charlatan, a fraud.</i>

122
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,568
- Not the Professor Madley.
- Pretending to commune with the dead.

123
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:48,045
Now, look. He and Ellis are just a couple of
struggling artists trying to make a living...

124
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,581
like fortune-tellers
or a vaudeville team.

125
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,743
I won't let the poor,
gullible people of Walton be fooled.

126
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,084
If my father were alive, these fakers
would never have gotten a license.

127
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,248
- Your father?
- Yes. Abraham Mills was a real mayor.

128
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:02,418
He wouldn't have stood by and let frauds
take advantage of honest people.

129
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,587
Wait a minute.
What if Mayor Mills...

130
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,097
would like to make another speech,
or tell you something?

131
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:10,032
- Suppose he's depending--
- Suppose you leave right now.

132
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,229
Suppose I do.

133
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,801
But don't forget.
The curtain goes up tonight at 8:00.

134
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,947
Birds of a feather.
They won't hatch anything here.

135
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:32,684
Trading on people's
sacred feelings.

136
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,087
Everything that's dear
held up to ridicule...

137
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,724
by frauds in a trance,
rapping on a table.

138
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,326
We won't have any of the cheap,
vulgar tricks of spiritualism here.

139
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,809
- You think I'm wrong?
- I think he's right.

140
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:56,211
But how can he be? June,
don't be taken in by his glib manner.

141
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,113
He meant it. Just two people
trying to make a living.

142
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:04,246
- Why can't they make an honest living?
- Are we to judge?

143
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,587
Well, it's too late now.
There's nothing we can do about it.

144
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,786
- Yes, there is.
- What?

145
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:15,925
We can buy two tickets. If we go,
everybody else will. Shall I call the hotel?

146
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:19,095
I'll think about it.

147
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:22,902
We thank thee, O Lord, for our daily bread
and for our many blessings.

148
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,033
<i>Amen.</i>

149
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,015
- Doughnut?
- No, thanks.

150
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,432
- Like to make a few extra dollars?
- How?

151
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,627
Push these tickets
with your customers.

152
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:54,001
- Give you 20% of all you sell.
- Sure. What are they for?

153
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,667
That spook meeting tonight, featuring
the one and only Professor Madley.

154
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,041
- No.
- Why not?

155
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,707
- If the ladies' auxiliary don't want 'em,
I don't want 'em.
- Don't worry about the women.

156
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,182
- They wouldn't miss hearing
Abraham Mills. - Mills?

157
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,049
The professor's bringing him back,
with a message.

158
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,886
- I don't believe in it.
- What's the difference?
You can still make yourself some money.

159
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,426
No, I don't wanna
get mixed up in anything.

160
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:21,192
- Pop. Coffee, please.
- Right away.

161
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,071
Here he is, Professor.
Your old friend Eric Stanton.

162
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,233
Old friend?
I don't recall.

163
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:33,709
- Buffalo, Schenectady.
- Sorry, I still can't remember.

164
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,374
- Let me see-- - Relax, Professor.
We've never met before.

165
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,815
Last night, in my room,
you said--

166
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,683
- And you never met him?
- Glad to meet you now, Professor.

167
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:47,054
Delighted, Mr. Stanton. Well, all the
signs point to a prosperous association.

168
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,593
- Dollar signs.
- I've sold a batch of tickets already.

169
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,323
- Couple of beers, please.
- <i>Okay. Coming up.</i>

170
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,093
I heard from my assistant here
that you really work wonders.

171
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:57,431
<i>Congratulations</i>
<i>on your success, my boy.</i>

172
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:59,834
We'll have sellout
after sellout.

173
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,998
Well, okay.

174
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,508
You know, I never believed that you
could talk Miss Mills into buying tickets.

175
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,875
I just had a call from her sister
to reserve a couple.

176
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,574
They're coming over to get a message
from their old man.

177
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,844
- Right, Professor?
- Ah, yes.

178
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,943
I had a visitation from him
on U.S. Route 101.

179
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,113
He definitely
arrives tonight.

180
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,623
What do you say, Pop?
Now do you believe it?

181
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,818
He definitely arrives
tonight, sir.

182
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,064
He better arrive tonight.
He's your main attraction.

183
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,361
Uh, dig up
the vital facts, Ellis.

184
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,629
Who is Mills, and what
does he wanna come back for?

185
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,763
- Okay. See you later.
- Wait a minute. Leave me one of these.

186
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,775
Oh, Pop. Let me
hang this up in here...

187
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,744
and I'll give you a couple of tickets
to the best show in town.

188
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:43,781
- All right. Go ahead.
- There you are.

189
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:47,375
Eric, my boy, you got a great calling:
spook promotion.

190
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:51,115
- You like to back that up with a fin?
- Well, gladly.

191
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,282
I hope to see you
in my room later.

192
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,987
I have a fine collection of friendly
spirits there, Scotch ancestry.

193
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,741
There you are, Stella.

194
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,143
Thank you.

195
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:24,980
Have you any idea what the deceased Mr.
Mills is going to say at the séance tonight?

196
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,527
- Why? - They thought a great
deal of him around here.

197
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:33,029
- You wanna be careful.
- Thanks.

198
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:23,673
A beer, please.

199
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,917
That the only record
in that box?

200
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:37,485
- I like it.
- He knows what you like.

201
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,826
That's for his wife
to worry about.

202
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,664
- What does he do?
- He's from New York.

203
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,068
New York.

204
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,369
He came out here to stay,
to get his health back.

205
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:52,706
How'd he lose it?

206
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:57,043
Workin' too hard,
I guess.

207
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,586
He used to be a big man
back there, on the police force.

208
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,623
You like to come
to the show?

209
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,919
You askin' me?

210
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,790
Here.

211
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,369
- Never mind.
- What's the matter?

212
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,963
I don't go places alone.

213
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,908
Okay.

214
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:28,104
- Here.
- Was that four beers?

215
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:31,706
Three beers
and a cup of coffee.

216
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,844
You have just heard the spirits
of citizens of Walton...

217
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,278
who have gone on before us, and who
have returned tonight through me--

218
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:07,011
returned to tell you how happy they are
in their eternal reward.

219
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,852
Now, my good friends of Walton,
we have come to our last and
most difficult experiment...

220
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,016
for which I must have
your undivided attention...

221
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:18,028
<i>and your sincere concentration.</i>

222
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,293
<i>I feel a strange vibration</i>
<i>coming over me.</i>

223
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,335
<i>The vibration of a spirit</i>
<i>who has remained troubled...</i>

224
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,338
<i>who has found no peace or</i>
<i>contentment since he departed:</i>

225
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,466
<i>Abraham Mills.</i>

226
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:37,015
<i>I can feel his troubled spirit</i>
<i>trying to get through from beyond.</i>

227
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,175
<i>Yes, Abraham Mills.</i>

228
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,887
<i>I can hear you.</i>

229
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:45,957
- Would you mind moving over, please?
- <i>Yes, Abraham Mills.</i>

230
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,354
- Like it?
- Oh, yes. Very much.

231
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,398
You're troubled because
your daughter Clara...

232
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,367
has lost practically
everything you left her:

233
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,337
<i>the bonds,</i>
<i>the orange groves.</i>

234
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,901
You can't understand how she could have
trusted that man-- that man--

235
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,503
John Martin. John Martin.

236
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,914
John Martin, who came here
after you passed on...

237
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:16,681
and talked her
into selling everything.

238
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:21,657
Why didn't she ask the police
for help when he ran away with the money?

239
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,853
- Come, Clara.
- <i>You'll find peace...</i>

240
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,898
<i>only when you know that Clara</i>
<i>will guard the last of the inheritance...</i>

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,264
<i>for herself</i>
<i>and her younger sister.</i>

242
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,837
<i>$25,000 in stocks</i>--

243
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:35,099
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have made you come.

244
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,519
Gee, that was awfully mysterious
how he knew everything.

245
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,287
- Say, can I ask you a favor?
- Sure. What?

246
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:58,693
- Well, you know the professor, don't you?
- Sure, I do.

247
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:00,856
I'd love to have
my fortune told.

248
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:04,231
- You think he'd do it if you ask him?
- I can tell it better myself.

249
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:08,033
- Where are we going?
- Your horoscope's up there.

250
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,133
- I'd like a drink.
- Okay, you're on. Where do we go?

251
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,804
I know the place.

252
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,022
I like the way you talk.

253
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:35,857
I like the way you dance.

254
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,838
- Yes, sir. Two bourbons.
- Who ordered them?

255
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,039
- You want them?
- Okay.

256
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,781
- Thanks.
- You said you'd tell my fortune.

257
00:20:54,886 --> 00:21:00,153
Well-- Uh, you don't belong
in a one-armed joint.

258
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,660
- No? - Not a girl like you.
You got style. Beautiful style.

259
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,821
You inherited that.

260
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,867
Your father was a leading citizen, rich.

261
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,596
- He trusted people too much.
- And?

262
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:16,504
Your mother-- Her line
seems to have run out.

263
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,668
Don't scare me. She runs
a boardinghouse in San Diego...

264
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:25,114
and my old man came
from a long line of drunks.

265
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,778
Anyway, there's a man in your life.
You just met him.

266
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,447
Tomorrow he's going
to San Francisco...

267
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,617
and you're gonna lie awake nights,
unable to forget him.

268
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,287
And what can I do
about it?

269
00:22:55,974 --> 00:23:00,809
Listen to that.
The sound of far-off places.

270
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:06,349
You like the sound
of the ocean?

271
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,279
I like the way you talk.

272
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:28,567
No. That's okay for kids,
but not for me. Not anymore.

273
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:33,838
- Where are you from?
- What has that got to do with it?

274
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,311
Okay, don't tell me.

275
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,748
I'm from New York.
Now you know.

276
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:43,412
Uh, what do you do when
you don't tell fortunes?

277
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,990
I help make 'em
for others.

278
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:50,027
I passed actresses, directors,
producers through a publicity mill I ran.

279
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,620
They came out famous,
their names in all the papers.

280
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,791
You know people like that?

281
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:59,997
I know all people in all places,
like 21, the Stork Club--

282
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,768
That's where you belong,
smothered in mink. I can see you there.

283
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:08,039
And do you see me with a ring on my
finger, somebody to give me a home?

284
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:12,606
- Sure. Sure.
- Now, look.

285
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:17,154
Last night I made up my mind.
That's the way I want it.

286
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:21,316
He didn't see it that way,
so I walked home, at night.

287
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:24,623
Miles before I got a ride.

288
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:28,130
Was plenty tired when I got in too.
You saw me.

289
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,793
- But when I make up my mind--
- Forget about last night.

290
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:41,235
You talk different, sure,
but you drive just like the rest.

291
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,747
Well, you've got
the wrong girl.

292
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:50,220
- Yeah?
- No! No!

293
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:54,816
- Tomorrow you're going.
Where does that leave me?
- You'll go with me.

294
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:59,761
What on? You got into town with
one dollar in your pocket. You're a fake!

295
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:04,461
Why, you little gyp. Dealing a buck out of
the cash register and calling--

296
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,163
Go on. Go on back
to your one-armed joint...

297
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,298
and wait for somebody
to come and marry you.

298
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,724
Coming, Eric?

299
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:40,270
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- <i>Professor's waiting.</i>

300
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:45,071
Never felt so good getting out of town,
even with the bills all paid.

301
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,873
Don't smile. Your face
looks better without it.

302
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,608
- See you downstairs.
- Okay.

303
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,253
Ah. Top of the morning,
my boy. Hop in.

304
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,413
- Good morning.
- Get in.

305
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,718
- I'm not going.
- Not going? What's wrong?

306
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,884
Nothing. You go ahead.
I'll meet you.

307
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:05,053
But, Eric, we need you
for the advance publicity.

308
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:07,222
San Francisco's
a tough town on spooks.

309
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,267
- Come on. Hit 'em like the earthquake.
- When I feel like it.

310
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,427
I made it clear to you
when I took this job.

311
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,596
You can't tie me down.
Cramps my style.

312
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,174
I always work best when
a certain feeling comes over me...

313
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:19,436
- and right now, I haven't got it.
- Genius.

314
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:23,071
Eric, my boy, you're an artist. You have
my sympathy and a bus ticket on the firm.

315
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,240
Never mind that.

316
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,251
Well, you'll always find your favorite
brand in my bureau drawer.

317
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,039
It's about time
you showed up.

318
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,228
My bus leaves
in 15 minutes.

319
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,393
Got a nickel?

320
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,775
I... just came back to say I--
I'm sorry about last night.

321
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,288
Save it.

322
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,665
- Nothing else you want to say?
- No.

323
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:31,697
- Don't give me that act.
- What act?

324
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,869
You know what I mean.

325
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:41,175
- Hello.
- So long, for good.

326
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,450
- What bit him?
- Trying to make his bus, I guess.

327
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:10,947
- Well, in or out?
- Skip it.

328
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,932
This finishes it.
You'll never see me again. Good-bye.

329
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,196
Good-bye.

330
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:41,879
- Oh!
- Always leave 'em laughing.

331
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,077
- You again. What do you want?
- I wanna talk to you.

332
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,213
Okay, talk.

333
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,153
Don't give me that smile.

334
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,199
Okay, I don't smile.

335
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,996
I thought you had
something to say.

336
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:09,699
- Doesn't that say it?
- Hmph. I heard that kind
of talk before. Good night.

337
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,810
I never said it before
to anybody, ever.

338
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,850
I'll marry you, Stella,
if that's what you want.

339
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:23,819
- You? You don't kid me.
- I'm not kidding.

340
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,757
- Last night-- - Last night I didn't know you,
what made you tick.

341
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,919
I know you now.

342
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:36,194
I know why I couldn't pull out of here
this morning or get on that bus.

343
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:39,862
I can't get away without you, Stella,
and I'm not going away without you.

344
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,496
- What's in it for me?
- You said you wanted that, didn't you?

345
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:46,168
- A ring on your finger?
- That isn't enough. What goes with it?

346
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:48,871
- I want a home.
- I'll get it for you.

347
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,414
What with?
One dollar in your pocket?

348
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,110
Twelve and a half
thousand dollars.

349
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:58,178
Where would you get
12 and a half thousand dollars?

350
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,224
What's the difference,
as long as I get it?

351
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,294
- How? You gonna murder somebody?
- Talk sense.

352
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:05,419
- You gonna steal it?
- Listen--

353
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,727
- Well, I don't know you.
- You know one thing:

354
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:11,666
We're gonna get married,
once I get the cash.

355
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,473
Maybe you'll get me in trouble.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

356
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:21,067
You won't, not the way
I'll get it.

357
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,238
I'm not even
telling you how.

358
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:25,612
You just sit tight
and wait for me.

359
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,118
That's the deal.
You'll keep it.

360
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,881
Maybe I will.

361
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:57,530
Very good performance, Miss Mills.

362
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,738
Please, go on.
Beethoven never sounded so good before.

363
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:05,680
- I wasn't playing Beethoven.
- No? Sure, it was Brahms.

364
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:09,378
The old boys do sound alike,
don't they? I mean, in spots.

365
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,149
- What spots? - You know,
the way they begin, the way they end...

366
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:14,850
sometimes in the middle,
like the piece you were just playing.

367
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:17,519
- Brahms, uh--
- It wasn't anything. I was just improvising.

368
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:20,062
If Brahms didn't write that,
you went him one better.

369
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:24,260
That was beautiful.
It was classical. It was inspiring.

370
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,769
You know, you belong
in Carnegie Hall.

371
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:31,604
Now look, you can't stay angry at me
forever, not two full days.

372
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:37,670
Wait a minute. What about
living up to the place we're in
and the music you play here...

373
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,875
so when a guy comes around
and says he's sorry...

374
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:42,578
the least you can do
is forgive him.

375
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,882
All right. I forgive you.

376
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,549
- Friends?
- I hardly know you.

377
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:50,559
Well, don't worry about that.
We'll fix it right away.

378
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,892
You know, it's a good thing word didn't
come through from New York this morning.

379
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:57,490
Gives me a chance to stay over another
day, square things with you and your sister.

380
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:03,739
Tell me, what is there to do in a town
like this to make time pass till tomorrow?

381
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:06,275
- That's up to you, isn't it?
- What do you do?

382
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:12,043
Oh, there's plenty to occupy
your time here: the movies, dancing.

383
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,642
The beach isn't far.
They'll tell you at the hotel.

384
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,914
You still think I tried
to hurt your sister.

385
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,719
I didn't mean to, really.
I only meant to help the professor.

386
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:25,557
But that's happened to me before. I try to
help somebody, somebody else gets hurt.

387
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:30,293
- That's the way it's been all my life.
- Of course. You live by impulse...

388
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:34,633
and you never bother to think
if you're following the right
impulse or the wrong one.

389
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,675
- I see you don't stop at music.
You read too. - Don't you?

390
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:42,007
Me? I haven't opened a book
since I left school. They're phony.

391
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:44,741
- So are some people.
- At least they're alive.

392
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,909
- So are books.
- Yeah, you come to a part you don't like...

393
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,615
you can turn the page,
but try it on people, or try it on life.

394
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:55,089
I'll tell you something
about yourself, Miss Mills.

395
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:59,687
You're scared to live. That's why you
bury yourself in books and music.

396
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:04,996
- I think you ought to respect
my ways as I respect yours.
- Only I live and you don't.

397
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,004
All the things you look
down on are the things that make up life.

398
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,973
- What things?
- Little things, like a game of bowling...

399
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:15,512
or a swim at night, or--

400
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:20,710
Or a dance, a kiss,
stuff that bubbles.

401
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:23,844
- Bet you never had a drink.
- That doesn't mean anything.

402
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,014
Not by itself it doesn't...

403
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,685
but you add up all the little things,
that's what makes up life.

404
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,560
- Maybe you're the one that's scared, not I.
- How come?

405
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,326
Well, you don't know what you want.
That's why you're scared.

406
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,301
That's why you keep running
after every little thing.

407
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,304
You know, that's quite
a mind you have there, Miss Mills.

408
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:44,966
You mean, for a girl
in a small town?

409
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,534
- Must be the books, huh?
- Must be.

410
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,342
You know, if you didn't know me so well,
I might ask you something.

411
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:54,247
- You'd probably say no, though.
- Probably.

412
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,547
So there's really no use
in asking, is there?

413
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,179
Well, why don't
you ask me anyway?

414
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,724
Will you have dinner
with me tonight?

415
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,919
Well, I--
I don't think I can.

416
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:07,725
You see? You're afraid
to step out of your tower.

417
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:11,165
- No, no, no. That isn't it.
- Your sister?

418
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,863
- Of course not.
- Then what are you afraid of?

419
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,099
- I'm not afraid. Why should I be?
- Yeah, why should you be?

420
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,939
- I'll pick you up at 7:00.
- At 7:00.

421
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,117
Two, please.

422
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,390
- Don't you ever see anything through
to the end? - When it's worth it.

423
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:43,297
Well, now we've had a dinner that you
didn't like and saw a movie you didn't like.

424
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:46,370
- What's next?
- Dancing?

425
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:51,874
All right. Let's not miss any of the
little things that make up your happy life.

426
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:56,379
Well, here's to your first scotch.

427
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,619
How do you like it?

428
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,088
Tastes like soap.

429
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:12,493
If this is what all your little things add
up to, I-- I don't think it's very much.

430
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,792
Did you learn how to play
Beethoven in one night? No.

431
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,561
Then don't expect to learn
how to play at this in one night.

432
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:20,899
- But I don't think you enjoy it either.
- Because you don't.

433
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:24,566
But I want to.
That's why I came.

434
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:30,170
- Frankly, why did you ask me? - No
special reason. You happen to interest me.

435
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,512
- In what way?
- Well, can't define it.

436
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,485
Maybe it's your charm.
Maybe it's your talent.

437
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,078
Ever think of a career?

438
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,249
- Maybe.
- And?

439
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,850
No. No, I know
my limitations.

440
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,486
One shouldn't set a limit
on what one can do.

441
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:50,829
Mr. Stanton, that sounds
as if it came out of a book...

442
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,994
and not a very good one.

443
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,165
There goes that mind again.
Shall we turn the page and dance?

444
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,334
Well, it's been
an awfully long time.

445
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,502
I'll lead you.

446
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,880
- You're doing fine.
- Thank you.

447
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,004
Hey. Ditch him,
and I'll meet you afterward.

448
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,540
I don't cheat on a date.

449
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,922
There's still
one more little thing.

450
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,433
But don't worry. I'm not going to kiss you
good night and make you unhappy.

451
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:00,868
Unhappy? Don't you take
too much for granted?

452
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,599
No. One kiss goes
a long way with you.

453
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,767
You need a guy who'll
take it the same way...

454
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:08,902
who'll give you a marriage
with all the trimmings, home and kids...

455
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,073
who'll walk to church with you
every Sunday and listen to you play.

456
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,708
Save all your
good-nights for him.

457
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:19,279
- What makes you think I wanted
you to kiss me? - Didn't you?

458
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:41,142
- Short of help this morning, huh?
- Kinda.

459
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:46,740
- She always come in this late?
- Sometimes. Why you want to know?

460
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,581
Oh, just thought maybe
she'd skipped out on you again.

461
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,554
No. She won't do it.
She promised me she won't.

462
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:56,023
Stella! Morning, Stella.

463
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,289
Good morning.

464
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:07,135
Oh. Sure could use
some coffee.

465
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,297
I got something special
for ya.

466
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,650
I waited for you last night
till after 3:00.

467
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,620
- That's nice.
- Where were you?

468
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,352
- Around.
- With that guy?

469
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,655
Leave me alone, will ya?
It's too early.

470
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,754
- Here you are.
- Mmm, thanks.

471
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:39,700
- Where'd you get the watch?
- Like it?

472
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,365
Get me some hash,
good and brown.

473
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,204
I said some hash.

474
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,274
You get this last night?

475
00:40:52,883 --> 00:40:55,351
Wait till we're married
and then ask me.

476
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,785
Till then, I don't have
to tell you a thing.

477
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:01,324
We're as good as married.

478
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,225
You're dropping out
of circulation, from now on.

479
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,559
When you go out,
it'll only be with me.

480
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,896
You got a steady date...
with Miss Mills.

481
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:13,060
I'm only doing that
for you.

482
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,229
Lot of good
I'm gettin' out of it.

483
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,807
You will,
in a couple of days.

484
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,570
Okay, couple days,
but that don't mean forever.

485
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,376
Morning, Mr. Judd.

486
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,886
Good morning, Stella.

487
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,435
Hello.

488
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,529
- With my compliments.
- Thank you.

489
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,371
- Thank you.
- I'm leaving tomorrow,
and I wanted to say good-bye.

490
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:56,742
Good-bye, Mr. Stanton.

491
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:00,010
We were just going to pick up a few
things. Can we take you anywhere?

492
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:02,142
Anywhere you say.

493
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:07,218
- Can three of us get in there?
- I think so. You go ahead.

494
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,349
Thank you.

495
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,698
Nice town.
Hate to leave it.

496
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:24,774
- Expect to go far?
- Maybe.

497
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:29,437
Maybe I'll be back...
and maybe I won't.

498
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,880
- It depends.
- On what?

499
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,178
On what there is
to come back to.

500
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,613
I'll be just a minute.

501
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,617
What would you come
back for, Mr. Stanton?

502
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:46,753
- June. - I gathered as much.
Let's be frank, shall we?

503
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:51,301
- My cards are on the table, Miss Mills.
- I want you to leave June alone.

504
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,962
We don't know who you are
or where you come from.

505
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,972
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

506
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:59,133
That's frank, at least.

507
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,178
And I'm sure you'll be interested to know
I have no bank account either.

508
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,976
- I thought so.
- Your hand is showing, Miss Mills.

509
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:09,450
- You've got a trump card: money.
And because I haven't any--
- That isn't true.

510
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:11,646
It has nothing to do
with money.

511
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,485
June has quite enough for
herself, even without my share.

512
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,356
- Your share?
- Yes, she'll get that too.

513
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,986
I want her to be happy.
That's all I care about.

514
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,258
It's all hers,
whatever I have--

515
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:26,564
In San Francisco, Mr. Stanton,
where no one can touch it.

516
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,763
Not until she meets
the right man.

517
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:34,002
Well, maybe I'm not
the right man after all.

518
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,841
And you won't see her again?

519
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,279
Suppose we leave that up to
the one concerned?

520
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:58,592
- There you are.
- Thank you.

521
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:07,009
- Wonderful. Just wonderful.
- If I've accomplished nothing else...

522
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:11,207
at least I made you like
one of the little things I like.

523
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,478
I have
my little secrets too.

524
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:18,180
Bet you think all I do
is read big, heavy books, don't you?

525
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:22,588
Well, I don't. For years, I've been
saving ads out of magazines.

526
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,995
Sometimes I-- I feel like
I'm the girl in the ads:

527
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,728
softly alluring, full of grace,
gowned by Schiaparelli.

528
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,929
If I had money,
I'd dress you like the ads...

529
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,906
take you to New York,
at least to San Francisco.

530
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,445
- You'd have that Schiaparelli gown.
- Hmm. It isn't that important.

531
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:46,676
It would be, when I took you to the
nightclubs, to the theater, the concerts.

532
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,344
Did you ever hear the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra?

533
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:54,015
- Mm-hmm, on the radio. - What do
you hear on the radio? A lot of noise.

534
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,183
But when you see 'em up
on the stage...

535
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:58,727
all dressed up with their
fiddles and their horns...

536
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,889
people right up to the roof, 10,000
of them, waiting for the music to begin.

537
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,433
That's a concert, particularly
when Toscanini conducts...

538
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,060
like he's going to
tomorrow afternoon.

539
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,799
- Toscanini?
- Yeah.

540
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:13,536
And you know what? After the concert,
I'll get him to listen to you play...

541
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,976
see who's right about
your talent, you or me.

542
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,413
- You know Arturo Toscanini? - I'll make
it my business to meet him, for you.

543
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:23,919
We can leave for San Francisco
in the morning and make it
in plenty of time. All right?

544
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:27,218
- No.
- Your sister?

545
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:31,624
- Yes.
- You gonna do everything she says?

546
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,788
No, but I--

547
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,264
Well, I guess after tonight
it's good-bye.

548
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,733
I guess it is.

549
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,635
Anyway, there are
a few things to remember.

550
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,799
Mm-hmm?

551
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:52,178
- It could have been wonderful--
- Mm-hmm.

552
00:45:52,282 --> 00:45:55,581
if I were another guy,
the right guy.

553
00:45:55,686 --> 00:46:00,180
Could have gone on like this,
night after night, just the two of us.

554
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,159
The fire, hot dogs,
wine, martinis.

555
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,526
Wonderful martinis.

556
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,829
- Could've been a dream.
- A beautiful dream.

557
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:16,531
- You and I together,
New York and San Francisco. - Mm-hmm.

558
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,803
Getting you all those
things in the ads.

559
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,870
Going everywhere together, to the
concerts, to hear the famous people play.

560
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:29,214
Becoming famous yourself.
Great career.

561
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,948
Miss June Mills, the finest
talent of them all.

562
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:35,081
Woman of the year.

563
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,115
<i>Who is it?</i>

564
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,379
Eric. I've got to
see you right away.

565
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,284
- <i>It can wait till tomorrow.</i>
- It's important.

566
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:41,448
<i>Okay. I'm listenin'.</i>

567
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:44,925
- I can't talk to you like this!
- <i>I can hear you.</i>

568
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,292
Come on. Open up the door.
What are you afraid of?

569
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,525
Pipe down, will ya?

570
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:53,865
Quiet! Do you wanna wake everybody up?
What do you want?

571
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,407
I came to tell you I can't go through
with it like I planned.

572
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:01,466
- It'll take too long.
- I knew it. You didn't stand a chance.

573
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,773
That isn't it.

574
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,906
Look, you know
how I feel about ya.

575
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,450
You gotta believe in me,
have confidence in me.

576
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,884
I want you, Stella.
I'm nuts about ya.

577
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,821
- That wasn't the deal.
- What of it?

578
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,392
I'll get you that home and
everything you wanted with it.

579
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:20,429
I can do it. I've got
ideas that work, pay off big.

580
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,589
Come on. Let's get
out of here, tonight.

581
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,758
I'm takin' no chances.

582
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,837
- Listen, Stella--
- I stick to a deal.

583
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,238
<i>Satisfied</i>
<i>there's nobody here?</i>

584
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,805
Now beat it!

585
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,027
- Yeah?
- Eric?

586
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:04,502
- Yeah. - So glad.
I was afraid you might have already left.

587
00:49:04,605 --> 00:49:07,540
- Who is this?
- June.

588
00:49:07,642 --> 00:49:09,701
Eric, I'm going with you.

589
00:49:09,811 --> 00:49:12,712
To San Francisco?

590
00:49:12,814 --> 00:49:16,614
To the concert on the 9:00 train. We'll
pick you up on the way to the station.

591
00:49:16,717 --> 00:49:20,153
- We?
- Yes, Clara's going along too.

592
00:49:20,254 --> 00:49:23,121
She had to go to San Francisco anyway
to take care of some business...

593
00:49:23,224 --> 00:49:26,284
so she thought she might as well do it
a week ahead of time.

594
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:30,194
- Glad to have her along.
- Thank you, Eric. We'll be right over.

595
00:49:56,691 --> 00:49:58,750
- Wanna wait here?
- No, I'll go in with you.

596
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,055
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

597
00:50:10,872 --> 00:50:12,931
Mills, Number 17.

598
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,407
Yes, Miss Mills.
Clara and June Mills, joint ownership.

599
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,911
Either one of you
sign here.

600
00:50:19,013 --> 00:50:22,744
- What's the rent on a box? - Four dollars
and up. There's none available now.

601
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:25,080
We might have
some vacancies next month.

602
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:29,384
- Oh, but I need one now. - You can
put whatever you want in our box.

603
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:32,687
- No, thanks. I might need it when
you're home. - Come on, June.

604
00:50:44,038 --> 00:50:48,202
- Have you... a telephone directory?
- Yes, right around the corner.

605
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:50,368
- This way?
- Yes.

606
00:50:50,478 --> 00:50:52,605
Thanks.

607
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:29,075
- The gentleman went to the phone.
- Thank you.

608
00:51:31,452 --> 00:51:33,750
- That was great luck. I found him in.
- Who?

609
00:51:33,854 --> 00:51:36,823
Somebody very important, might have
a great effect on your career.

610
00:51:36,924 --> 00:51:40,553
- Who is he?
- Wait till you meet him.
I told him we'd be over right away.

611
00:51:42,196 --> 00:51:44,255
Go ahead. I want to
make a call from here.

612
00:51:44,365 --> 00:51:46,424
I'll-- I'll meet you
after the concert.

613
00:51:46,534 --> 00:51:49,128
No, we wouldn't think of it.
Eric asked you to go with us.

614
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,295
- Thanks, but--
- Sure you're going.

615
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:53,930
Meet us at 2:30 sharp
in front of the auditorium.

616
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:58,000
- 2:30. Good luck.
- Thanks. We'll need it.

617
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:26,199
- There is no concert. I suppose you
know that. - He knew it all along.

618
00:52:26,307 --> 00:52:29,708
- Getting us all the way up here
to San Francisco-- - He had to.

619
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,506
- Why?
- Can you think of any better way
of getting June out of Walton?

620
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:34,672
Long as she was there,
we didn't have a chance.

621
00:52:34,782 --> 00:52:36,841
- What chance?
- Get married.

622
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:43,151
- Married? - Sure. Here's the evidence.
Certificate of marriage.

623
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:48,251
June, you don't know
what you've done.

624
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:52,162
- I do.
- I'll have the whole thing annulled.

625
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:54,257
No, you won't, Clara.
I know what I want.

626
00:52:54,368 --> 00:52:56,427
This isn't as sudden
as you think.

627
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,801
Well? What's the verdict?

628
00:53:03,477 --> 00:53:06,469
- I hope you'll be very happy.
- Thank you, Clara.

629
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,777
I suppose the next thing to say is,
shall we be friends?

630
00:53:11,318 --> 00:53:14,446
We could be--
if you'd make June happy.

631
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:17,547
Sure I will.
Right from the start.

632
00:53:17,658 --> 00:53:19,819
What are your plans?

633
00:53:19,927 --> 00:53:23,419
Well, I'd like to go home first
and get a few things together.

634
00:53:23,531 --> 00:53:26,398
Then we'll go someplace for
a little while. All right, Eric?

635
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,958
Okay. Back to Walton. But first
I'd, uh, like to try another bank.

636
00:53:30,071 --> 00:53:32,130
I want to put this
in a safe-deposit box.

637
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,298
Don't want to take any chances
carrying it around.

638
00:53:34,408 --> 00:53:37,434
- I have a few valuables too, you know.
- Why don't you put it in our box?

639
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:41,140
- They wouldn't pass me. It's in your name.
- I'll put it away for you.

640
00:53:47,722 --> 00:53:51,317
- I always thought of it that way,
didn't I, June? - Yes, dear.

641
00:53:51,425 --> 00:53:55,794
I said to myself, "When June gets married,
this will be her home.

642
00:53:55,896 --> 00:54:00,094
I'll give it to her and her husband
to do with as they please.

643
00:54:00,201 --> 00:54:03,466
If I'm to stay on
it'll be as a guest.

644
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:05,596
A guest in June's home."

645
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:09,168
Assuming, of course,
that I'm wanted.

646
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:11,540
- Of course we want you with us.
- Absolutely.

647
00:54:11,645 --> 00:54:13,670
- Here. Have some more.
- No.

648
00:54:15,082 --> 00:54:17,812
It's time for a guest
to say good night.

649
00:54:17,918 --> 00:54:19,943
Good night.

650
00:54:23,891 --> 00:54:25,916
Good night, Clara.

651
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:06,290
I'll be up in a minute.

652
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:34,113
Won't you even
have a drink with me?

653
00:56:34,221 --> 00:56:36,655
I got a date.

654
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:38,748
Can I walk you home?

655
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:40,952
I said I got a date.

656
00:56:41,996 --> 00:56:45,523
Good night, Stella.
Don't forget to lock the door.

657
00:56:54,108 --> 00:56:56,167
- Stella.
- Yeah?

658
00:56:56,277 --> 00:56:58,677
You're going to San Francisco tomorrow.

659
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:00,940
Am I?

660
00:57:01,048 --> 00:57:03,642
Tomorrow I'll have that money--
all of it.

661
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:07,118
- You meet up there, and then we'll--
- How do I know you'll have it?

662
00:57:07,221 --> 00:57:09,985
Because I'm going to
San Francisco with her to get it.

663
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,025
Well, I won't.
And she won't either.

664
00:57:13,127 --> 00:57:15,960
Oh, yes, she will.
It's her honeymoon.

665
00:57:18,132 --> 00:57:21,966
- Her what?
- Yeah. I married her.

666
00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:25,527
This afternoon.
It was the only way.

667
00:57:25,639 --> 00:57:29,541
Congratulations.

668
00:57:29,643 --> 00:57:32,168
Now, listen.
We're really not married.

669
00:57:32,279 --> 00:57:34,338
I mean, we'll be divorced in no time.

670
00:57:34,448 --> 00:57:37,474
I haven't even kissed her. As a matter
of fact, I can have it annulled.

671
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:39,484
Good night.

672
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,577
Now, wait a minute.

673
00:57:41,689 --> 00:57:44,317
What do you want?
She's your wife, not me.

674
00:57:44,425 --> 00:57:46,416
I don't run around
with married men.

675
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:48,927
I did it for you--
to get you what you wanted.

676
00:57:49,029 --> 00:57:51,020
Now you'll keep
your part of the deal.

677
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:56,433
Oh, sure, but she's got the ring
on her finger. She's not so dumb.

678
00:57:56,537 --> 00:57:58,835
Well, I'm not
a dope either.

679
00:58:25,966 --> 00:58:28,025
<i>Good morning.</i>

680
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:38,638
- Sugar? Cream?
- No.

681
00:58:46,453 --> 00:58:51,049
- Go ahead. Say it.
- I have nothing to say, Eric.

682
00:58:51,158 --> 00:58:53,251
I'm waiting for you.

683
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:57,059
Well, I'm sorry.

684
00:58:57,164 --> 00:59:00,497
Maybe I shouldn't have
stayed out that late.

685
00:59:00,601 --> 00:59:03,570
All of a sudden, there I was,
a married man.

686
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,729
I had to go out
for a drink.

687
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,103
By the time I got back in
you were asleep.

688
00:59:08,208 --> 00:59:10,608
Why did you go to see
that girl in the diner?

689
00:59:10,711 --> 00:59:14,613
- What girl?
- Clara saw you.

690
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:18,412
- You mean she went out after me?
- Yes. She told me this morning.

691
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:21,613
Well, that's fine.
Clara told you.

692
00:59:21,722 --> 00:59:25,089
What's she gonna do? Follow me
around everywhere I go, check up on me?

693
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:29,185
That sister of yours has been
running your life up to now, and
she better stay out of mine.

694
00:59:29,296 --> 00:59:31,526
- You tell her.
- I was angry with her too at first...

695
00:59:31,632 --> 00:59:33,623
but she means well.

696
00:59:33,734 --> 00:59:36,726
Yeah? Then why
did she tell you?

697
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:39,101
So you can have
a good time worrying?

698
00:59:39,206 --> 00:59:41,766
I didn't worry.

699
00:59:43,377 --> 00:59:46,778
Until that-- that man
came to see you.

700
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,280
What man?

701
00:59:49,383 --> 00:59:51,613
He's with the police.

702
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,743
Wants to ask you something.

703
00:59:53,854 --> 00:59:56,379
Ask me what?

704
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:00,654
About that girl.
She was found murdered.

705
01:00:02,362 --> 01:00:04,387
Stella?

706
01:00:04,498 --> 01:00:06,659
Yes. Yes.
That was her name.

707
01:00:10,537 --> 01:00:14,029
Eric, what did she
mean to you?

708
01:00:17,344 --> 01:00:19,904
Does Mr. Judd know?

709
01:00:20,013 --> 01:00:22,004
Judd?

710
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:24,710
He's downstairs waiting.

711
01:00:37,798 --> 01:00:41,461
- Mr. Judd.
- <i>Congratulations, Mr. Stanton.</i>
<i>I just heard you were married.</i>

712
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:44,298
- And my very best wishes to you, Mrs.
Stanton. - Thank you.

713
01:00:44,404 --> 01:00:47,168
Well, our church organist
certainly surprised us all.

714
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:50,107
Married in San Francisco
and not in a church.

715
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,371
It certainly saves time,
doesn't it?

716
01:00:52,479 --> 01:00:56,438
Gives one the chance to get back the same
night and have a nice little family dinner.

717
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:58,882
- And after that, where'd you go?
- We retired.

718
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:02,217
- Everybody?
- I locked the door myself.

719
01:01:02,322 --> 01:01:05,155
Mm-hmm.

720
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:07,523
Well, I guess I'll check up
on a few things.

721
01:01:07,628 --> 01:01:09,823
- Uh, mind if I go with you?
- Not a bit.

722
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:11,955
Thank you.

723
01:01:21,508 --> 01:01:24,409
- How did it happen? Who did it?
- I don't know yet.

724
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:28,311
The chief of police called me this morning
and asked me to give them a little help.

725
01:01:28,415 --> 01:01:30,747
He appointed me
special investigator.

726
01:01:30,851 --> 01:01:33,513
- You know, it's strange.
- What is?

727
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:36,589
That a man doesn't spend
his wedding night at home.

728
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,250
- Did Clara tell you?
- No. She didn't say anything.

729
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,418
I saw you around myself.

730
01:01:50,671 --> 01:01:53,071
<i>Out of the way, folks.</i>
<i>One side, please.</i>

731
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:57,500
Hi, Mr. Judd.

732
01:02:01,448 --> 01:02:04,349
One side, please.
One side.

733
01:02:04,451 --> 01:02:06,476
<i>Out of the way.</i>

734
01:02:14,628 --> 01:02:16,653
- Hello, Mr. Judd.
- Johnson.

735
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:37,540
Hello, Pop.

736
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:52,898
You can sit down now.

737
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,059
- Thanks for coming, Mr. Judd.
- Chief.

738
01:02:55,168 --> 01:02:59,571
Coroner was here. He'll send in
his report as soon as possible.

739
01:02:59,673 --> 01:03:02,267
In the meantime, however--

740
01:03:02,376 --> 01:03:04,640
here's what he said.

741
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:08,806
"She was killed by a blow
on the left temple.

742
01:03:08,915 --> 01:03:13,909
Weapon: Undetermined.
Probably a lead pipe.

743
01:03:14,021 --> 01:03:17,923
Time of death:
Between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m."

744
01:03:19,393 --> 01:03:21,861
- Find the weapon?
- It's not in here.

745
01:03:24,731 --> 01:03:28,462
- Who's she?
- She lives downstairs, Mr. Judd.

746
01:03:28,568 --> 01:03:32,629
Says someone ran out of here
late last night.

747
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:36,698
She found the girl's watch
under the step this morning.

748
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:38,937
Guess he must have
dropped it.

749
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,725
- What did he look like?
- Oh, I don't know, mister.

750
01:03:52,826 --> 01:03:54,953
It was so dark
I couldn't see him.

751
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:58,498
Just as I went to close the window,
I-- I saw him running down the street.

752
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:00,623
How do you know
it was a man you saw?

753
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,202
- I didn't say it was a man.
- Then it was a woman?

754
01:04:03,303 --> 01:04:05,328
- No.
- Then it had to be a man.

755
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:08,840
- Well, I guess it was.
A man always took her home. - Who?

756
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:11,240
I don't know.

757
01:04:11,345 --> 01:04:13,438
I saw him come up.

758
01:04:17,751 --> 01:04:19,776
And once I saw him.

759
01:04:21,822 --> 01:04:24,188
Which one did you see
last night?

760
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:28,091
Oh, I can't say
it was them. Honest.

761
01:04:28,195 --> 01:04:31,562
Can I go now, mister?
I should be down in the store.

762
01:04:31,665 --> 01:04:36,500
- Please. I don't like to stay in here.
- You can go.

763
01:04:43,777 --> 01:04:46,371
So can you, Pop.

764
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:48,914
I don't need you
right now.

765
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:52,041
Let me stay, Mr. Judd.
It's her room.

766
01:04:52,152 --> 01:04:54,347
It was her room, Pop.

767
01:04:54,454 --> 01:04:57,082
She was a good girl,
wasn't she, Mr. Judd?

768
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:59,454
She never meant bad.

769
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:02,858
- Everybody liked her.
- Yes.

770
01:05:02,963 --> 01:05:04,988
Everybody.

771
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:09,635
- Your name?
- <i>Atkins.</i>

772
01:05:09,736 --> 01:05:11,727
I gave my statement
to the chief.

773
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:14,932
- What do you do?
- Well, you know me.
I operate jukeboxes around here.

774
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:18,704
- And slot machines.
- Only in Nevada where it's legal.

775
01:05:18,812 --> 01:05:21,872
Now, look. I already said
what I had to to the chief.

776
01:05:21,982 --> 01:05:24,473
I'm not answering
any more questions.

777
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:27,451
What makes you think
I'm going to question you, Mr. Atkins?

778
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:31,320
- I know how cops work.
- How do they work, Mr. Atkins?

779
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:33,655
Well, you're
supposed to show me.

780
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,656
Perhaps we'd better
go in there.

781
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:40,130
- If you don't mind.
- No. I don't mind.

782
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:45,931
<i>Here's his statement, Mr. Judd.</i>

783
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:49,736
Check his alibi. There's a phone
in the store downstairs.

784
01:05:49,843 --> 01:05:51,868
Right away.

785
01:06:07,194 --> 01:06:09,219
Sit down.

786
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:17,096
Now, let's get down
to facts, Mr. Atkins.

787
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:19,195
You've got my alibi
right there.

788
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:22,332
If you don't believe me, why don't
you wait till the chief gets back?

789
01:06:22,442 --> 01:06:24,603
But I'm not interested
in your alibi.

790
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:27,373
I'd like to know when
you gave her this watch.

791
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:31,383
When? Why don't you
ask me <i>if</i> I gave it to her?

792
01:06:31,485 --> 01:06:34,454
- I know you did.
- You don't.

793
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:36,886
I told you I know
how cops work.

794
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,924
I don't believe you know
how I work, Mr. Atkins.

795
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,460
- With kid gloves?
- Certainly.

796
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:53,300
I don't like to mess up
any case I'm on.

797
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:57,968
- You gave her the watch, didn't you?
- No.

798
01:06:58,078 --> 01:06:59,875
- You did.
- No.

799
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,039
You gave it to her.

800
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,139
- <i>You gave her the watch, didn't you?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

801
01:07:04,251 --> 01:07:06,219
<i>You did.</i>

802
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,310
- <i>You gave it to her.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

803
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:14,153
<i>You gave it to her.</i>

804
01:07:29,709 --> 01:07:31,870
All right.
Let's pick it up.

805
01:07:31,978 --> 01:07:34,071
What about you and Stella?

806
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,877
Well, I've known her
for a long time.

807
01:07:37,984 --> 01:07:41,784
I used to board at her mother's home
down in San Diego.

808
01:07:44,658 --> 01:07:47,422
I... didn't have
any money then...

809
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:49,518
so I couldn't marry her.

810
01:07:49,629 --> 01:07:53,963
Skip the romance. Last night
you picked her up at 10:15.

811
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:56,865
You were with her until 2:00.
What happened in between?

812
01:07:56,970 --> 01:07:59,962
<i>We had dinner.</i>

813
01:08:00,073 --> 01:08:02,439
<i>Drove down to the beach.</i>

814
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:04,737
<i>Well? You got there, didn't you?</i>

815
01:08:04,844 --> 01:08:08,610
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>That's when she said she'd marry me.</i>

816
01:08:08,715 --> 01:08:11,809
<i>Then you brought her home.</i>
<i>You came up to kiss the bride.</i>

817
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:15,979
<i>No, no. I didn't come up.</i>
<i>I left right away.</i>

818
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:18,887
<i>You see, when Stella was</i>
<i>murdered...</i>

819
01:08:18,992 --> 01:08:21,893
<i>I was in a motor court</i>
<i>Just outside of Glenolden.</i>

820
01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:23,963
That's a hundred miles away.

821
01:08:24,064 --> 01:08:26,328
How do you know
what time Stella was murdered?

822
01:08:26,433 --> 01:08:28,901
The coroner's report.

823
01:08:29,002 --> 01:08:32,165
It says around 4:00.

824
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:34,604
Oh, you know I couldn't
have murdered her.

825
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:36,733
Sit down.

826
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,280
- You did give her the watch, didn't you?
- No.

827
01:08:43,416 --> 01:08:47,147
- Tell him I went home.
- <i>Come on, Mr. Atkins.</i>

828
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,915
<i>Just for the record.</i>
<i>So we can clear that up.</i>

829
01:08:50,023 --> 01:08:53,652
Doesn't make you any more guilty
if you did give it to her.

830
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:58,197
You quarreled, you took it back,
then you lost it on the way down.

831
01:08:58,298 --> 01:09:00,323
No. I never gave her
any jewelry.

832
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,958
- Come on, Mr. Atkins. Admit it.
- No.

833
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:05,196
- Admit you were generous just once.
- No.

834
01:09:05,305 --> 01:09:07,330
- Admit it.
- No.

835
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:18,607
- Mr. Stanton.
- Look. You don't try that on me.

836
01:09:18,718 --> 01:09:23,155
I wouldn't think of it.
I just happen not to like his face.

837
01:09:23,256 --> 01:09:26,384
<i>Mr. Judd,</i>
<i>his alibi is okay.</i>

838
01:09:26,493 --> 01:09:31,624
The Lido Motor Court in Glenolden
said he checked in at 2:30.

839
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:35,724
All right, Mr. Atkins.
You may go now.

840
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:39,236
- I knew his alibi would hold up.
- You got the watch?

841
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:46,038
I didn't say
you could go, Mr. Stanton.

842
01:09:49,749 --> 01:09:51,717
- Sit down.
- I'm onto the rules.

843
01:09:51,818 --> 01:09:54,685
You can't ask me anything
or hold me without charges.

844
01:09:54,788 --> 01:09:57,018
You seem to be
an expert on loopholes.

845
01:09:57,123 --> 01:09:59,683
Perhaps you could tell us
who might have murdered the girl.

846
01:09:59,793 --> 01:10:02,887
- I don't know. Could have
been anybody. Atkins maybe.
- No. It isn't Atkins.

847
01:10:02,996 --> 01:10:05,487
- Pop. He was stuck on her.
- Perhaps.

848
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:08,396
- Or was it a woman? Clara Mills.
- Or the woman downstairs.

849
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:10,765
- Or you, Mr. Stanton.
- Or you, Mr. Judd.

850
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:13,668
A splendid deduction.
Possibilities are many.

851
01:10:13,773 --> 01:10:15,764
And all quite interesting,
don't you think?

852
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:17,866
In a cold-blooded
sort of way. Sure.

853
01:10:17,977 --> 01:10:20,844
- You still aren't helping us get anywhere.
- It's your case.

854
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:23,177
But you're involved in it.
More than you realize.

855
01:10:23,283 --> 01:10:25,274
- Now, look.
- I'm looking.

856
01:10:25,385 --> 01:10:29,116
The facts--
They're all against you.

857
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:32,385
You came into town
with no obvious reasons--

858
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:34,960
of course,
you were going elsewhere--

859
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,621
meet a young lady,
spend some time with her...

860
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:39,722
then you come up here.

861
01:10:39,833 --> 01:10:42,529
The woman downstairs
saw you.

862
01:10:42,635 --> 01:10:45,695
Then you meet another
young lady and marry her.

863
01:10:45,805 --> 01:10:49,571
On your wedding night you walk the streets
looking for young lady number one.

864
01:10:49,676 --> 01:10:51,974
How do we know you didn't
wait for her until--

865
01:10:52,078 --> 01:10:54,478
I didn't.

866
01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:57,106
You're an expert,
Mr. Stanton.

867
01:10:57,217 --> 01:11:00,618
You know the exact value
of a man's word against facts.

868
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,154
- Are you accusing me?
- Not yet.

869
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:05,781
Perhaps after
we find the weapon.

870
01:11:05,892 --> 01:11:10,226
However, I wouldn't plan on any
out of town honeymoon just yet.

871
01:11:10,330 --> 01:11:13,094
We might need you
any moment.

872
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:15,224
Good day.

873
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:25,435
What are you packing for?
You're not going away now, are you?

874
01:11:25,545 --> 01:11:27,513
Yes, I am.

875
01:11:27,614 --> 01:11:30,845
Oh, June, I won't let you go with him.
Not after that girl was murdered.

876
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:33,510
- I'm going, Clara.
- How can you?

877
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:38,023
Why throw yourself away on someone
who's not worth it? He isn't worth it.

878
01:11:38,124 --> 01:11:42,026
Oh, June, it's no use. There's no happiness
in it. I know. I've been through all this.

879
01:11:42,128 --> 01:11:44,756
It's not the same thing, Clara.
Please try to understand.

880
01:11:44,864 --> 01:11:47,128
I do understand.

881
01:11:47,233 --> 01:11:49,667
Once I believed
in someone too.

882
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:52,704
No matter what people said,
I believed in him.

883
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:54,865
You don't know
what he meant to me--

884
01:11:54,974 --> 01:11:59,035
what all of his lies and broken promises
and dishonesty did to me.

885
01:11:59,145 --> 01:12:02,114
I can't let you
ruin your life too.

886
01:12:02,215 --> 01:12:05,616
June, a man who went out after another
woman the night of your marriage.

887
01:12:05,718 --> 01:12:08,482
Maybe you're right, Clara,
but I can't let it end now.

888
01:12:08,588 --> 01:12:11,216
I must give us every chance.
I hardly know him yet.

889
01:12:11,324 --> 01:12:14,452
We've said so little to each other,
we're practically strangers.

890
01:12:14,561 --> 01:12:17,655
- Together, maybe he'll change.
- He won't change.

891
01:12:17,764 --> 01:12:20,631
Maybe not. But at least
I'll have tried...

892
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:22,792
done everything I could.

893
01:12:22,902 --> 01:12:25,200
Good-bye, Clara.

894
01:12:38,451 --> 01:12:42,319
- Eric, there's a train leaving
in a half hour, and I thought--
- Forget about the honeymoon.

895
01:12:42,422 --> 01:12:44,856
I'm beating it-- alone.
I'll make better time.

896
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:47,483
- You're running away?
- What do you want me to do?

897
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:50,256
Stick around here?
Get framed?

898
01:12:50,363 --> 01:12:53,230
My face punched in.
You bet I'm running away.

899
01:12:53,333 --> 01:12:55,824
Won't it look bad if--
if they want you?

900
01:12:55,935 --> 01:13:01,032
That's for Mr. Judd to figure out. If he wants
to pin it on me, he'll have to find me first.

901
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,735
- Where will you go?
- What do you want to know for?

902
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:07,244
Because I want to
go with you.

903
01:13:07,347 --> 01:13:09,941
You'll need me to get the money
in San Francisco.

904
01:13:10,049 --> 01:13:13,109
- Who asked you for money?
- You'll need it.

905
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:17,282
You mean you're
giving me the money?

906
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,882
No. No, I'm not giving it to you.
It belongs to both of us.

907
01:13:20,994 --> 01:13:24,862
All right. But when this thing blows over
I'll pay it back to you-- every cent.

908
01:13:24,964 --> 01:13:26,932
- Very well. I'll get the car.
- No.

909
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:29,797
And we can't take the train.
Or the bus either.

910
01:13:29,903 --> 01:13:31,928
Judd'll have them
all watched.

911
01:13:32,038 --> 01:13:34,268
We've gotta get on the highway
without being seen.

912
01:13:34,374 --> 01:13:37,138
We'll hitchhike to San Francisco--
and no luggage.

913
01:13:37,243 --> 01:13:40,542
It's gotta look as if we were just out
taking a walk. Come on.

914
01:14:06,072 --> 01:14:08,404
Good evening.

915
01:14:08,508 --> 01:14:10,601
- In and out. Out and in.
- Sorry.

916
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:15,977
One right after the other.
Can't even wait till the room's ready.

917
01:14:16,082 --> 01:14:19,813
I never saw such a rush.
Everybody getting married.

918
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:26,649
What a dump.

919
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:29,250
It isn't so bad.

920
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:37,030
- Tired?
- Maybe I am--

921
01:14:37,136 --> 01:14:39,764
waiting for
something to happen.

922
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,999
Nothing's going to happen.

923
01:15:28,521 --> 01:15:30,580
Shut if off, will you?

924
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:36,154
I just thought
you might like a drink.

925
01:15:36,262 --> 01:15:38,730
I sure would.
But not that.

926
01:15:38,831 --> 01:15:42,198
Well, there's a bar downstairs,
and we still have a little money left.

927
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:45,270
What do you want me to do?
Walk right into his arms?

928
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:48,465
- He probably isn't after you at all.
- Not much.

929
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:53,744
Must have sent a description
of me to all the papers.

930
01:15:56,949 --> 01:15:59,042
Maybe we missed an edition.

931
01:15:59,152 --> 01:16:01,450
Couldn't be in the papers yet.
It's too early.

932
01:16:01,554 --> 01:16:04,717
- There's no reason to be afraid.
- Sure. A murder rap's nothing.

933
01:16:04,824 --> 01:16:07,588
Let's just up and go home
so he can pin it on me.

934
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,752
I didn't say
we ought to go home.

935
01:16:09,862 --> 01:16:11,955
Oh, you didn't say it,
but you meant it.

936
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:14,863
The room's not good enough.
Why don't you go on, tell me?

937
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:19,063
- I got you into this. You're sorry you ever
came. - But I'm not sorry. I wanted to.

938
01:16:19,172 --> 01:16:22,573
What for? So you could drive me nuts
with that quiet way of yours?

939
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:24,870
- Eric.
- Why'd I ever bring you anyway?

940
01:16:24,977 --> 01:16:28,708
I don't need your dough. Wouldn't have to
wait around here, hang around this dump.

941
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:32,046
If I'd been alone I could have
kept right on going.

942
01:16:32,151 --> 01:16:34,176
Maybe I will.

943
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:59,076
Double scotch, please.
Better make it a single.

944
01:16:59,178 --> 01:17:02,636
- I'll settle for a beer.
- Better make up your mind, mister.

945
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:05,114
It is made up. A beer.

946
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:47,317
- <i>Eric?</i>
- Yes.

947
01:17:49,929 --> 01:17:52,864
<i>Would you give me a towel, please?</i>
<i>They're on the bed.</i>

948
01:17:57,136 --> 01:17:59,195
- Here.
- Thank you.

949
01:18:08,347 --> 01:18:11,248
<i>Eric, would you get me my coat?</i>
<i>It's in the closet.</i>

950
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,785
Here.

951
01:18:42,114 --> 01:18:44,082
I, uh...

952
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,310
thought I'd bring you
one of these.

953
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:50,180
Thank you.

954
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:53,781
And this.
Help you pass the time.

955
01:18:54,894 --> 01:18:56,953
That's very sweet of you.

956
01:18:57,063 --> 01:19:00,965
Ah, I thought it would say it
better than I could, that--

957
01:19:01,067 --> 01:19:04,434
- I'm sorry. Just nerves, I guess.
- I understand.

958
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:08,906
All I mean is there's nothing in
it for you, chasing around like
this. You ought to go home.

959
01:19:09,008 --> 01:19:11,704
- No. - Why do you waste your
money on a guy like me?

960
01:19:11,811 --> 01:19:13,779
I'm not wasting my money.

961
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:16,404
It's yours as well.
I don't care what you do with it.

962
01:19:16,515 --> 01:19:19,484
Burn it up, tear it up,
do anything you want with it!

963
01:19:22,321 --> 01:19:25,586
Take it easy.
I only meant it for your sake.

964
01:19:25,725 --> 01:19:29,286
If you had any consideration at all,
you wouldn't even mention the money.

965
01:19:29,395 --> 01:19:32,489
Okay. But any time you want to,
you can always pull out. Remember that.

966
01:19:32,598 --> 01:19:34,964
They'll fix you up with a divorce
just for the asking.

967
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:38,901
Just tell them how I lied, that
I only married you for your
money. I'm wanted for murder--

968
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:41,735
- You didn't murder that girl.
- Maybe I did. You didn't even ask me.

969
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:44,435
- I didn't have to. I knew you didn't.
- What do you know about me?

970
01:19:44,543 --> 01:19:47,944
All I know is that I love you.
I love you, Eric. I love you!

971
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:15,101
I could go on for the rest of the night
telling you about my batting average--

972
01:20:15,207 --> 01:20:17,175
how many times
I've struck out.

973
01:20:17,276 --> 01:20:20,541
Even when I hit a home run,
it isn't any different.

974
01:20:20,646 --> 01:20:23,809
Like the time in New York
just before I came west.

975
01:20:23,916 --> 01:20:26,111
I'd started a publicity office.

976
01:20:26,218 --> 01:20:28,277
Like always, it was
great in the beginning.

977
01:20:28,387 --> 01:20:33,689
Guy comes along, wants to
buy the business, offered
me 8,000 bucks on the line.

978
01:20:33,793 --> 01:20:37,285
I took it. We had
a big celebration that night.

979
01:20:37,396 --> 01:20:40,388
In a couple of hours
I'd lost half of it back--

980
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:42,490
to him and his friends.

981
01:20:42,601 --> 01:20:46,059
I knew the dice were loaded,
but I couldn't prove it.

982
01:20:46,172 --> 01:20:50,199
Anyway, I came west.
Chicago for a while.

983
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:52,539
Then Omaha.

984
01:20:52,645 --> 01:20:57,048
Las Vegas. That's where I dropped
the other half of the dough.

985
01:20:57,149 --> 01:21:02,314
When I was kicked off of that bus
at Walton, I only had one dollar left.

986
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:08,048
And then--
Ah, but why go on?

987
01:21:09,829 --> 01:21:12,093
I want to know
everything about you.

988
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:17,928
It all adds up to
only one thing: a washout.

989
01:21:18,037 --> 01:21:21,268
That's what you're looking at.
A complete washout at 30.

990
01:21:23,376 --> 01:21:25,571
Yeah. I'm finished okay.

991
01:21:25,678 --> 01:21:28,169
- You're not finished, Eric.
- Sure I am.

992
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:32,080
I'm tired-- like I was
a million years old...

993
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:34,516
with a million jobs behind me.

994
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:37,248
And girls.

995
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:39,415
Chances I never followed up.

996
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:41,584
Eric...

997
01:21:41,694 --> 01:21:45,596
did you care
very much for Stella?

998
01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:49,058
I don't know.

999
01:21:49,168 --> 01:21:51,193
I guess I did.

1000
01:21:52,705 --> 01:21:55,765
I even promised her
I'd marry her.

1001
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:59,208
I can't figure it out now.

1002
01:21:59,311 --> 01:22:01,541
Would have lasted
a couple of weeks.

1003
01:22:01,647 --> 01:22:03,672
Maybe less.

1004
01:22:05,818 --> 01:22:08,309
Anyway, that's all gone.

1005
01:22:10,556 --> 01:22:13,116
Just as if it died with her.

1006
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:16,251
Yeah. That's over too.

1007
01:22:16,362 --> 01:22:19,490
Up in smoke,
like everything in my life.

1008
01:22:19,598 --> 01:22:24,558
My school. The publicity game.
Easy come, easy go.

1009
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,936
I got everything by talking fast
in a world that goes for talkin'...

1010
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:31,805
and end up with
exactly nothing.

1011
01:22:35,915 --> 01:22:39,180
Perhaps we can find what you want
when this is all cleared up.

1012
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:41,981
<i>If</i> it's cleared up.

1013
01:22:42,087 --> 01:22:46,183
Eric, wouldn't it look better
not to run away?

1014
01:22:46,292 --> 01:22:49,625
- To go back to Walton?
- Sure. Go back to the chair.

1015
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,821
Or is it the gas chamber
in California?

1016
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:55,458
If you're innocent,
there's nothing to worry about.

1017
01:22:55,568 --> 01:22:58,002
Maybe that's the way
it works in your books...

1018
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:02,335
but even when I was a kid I was always
being beaten up for something I didn't do.

1019
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:06,377
That's when I learned
to run away before it was too late.

1020
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:08,470
You're tired.

1021
01:23:08,581 --> 01:23:10,606
Come. Lie down.

1022
01:23:15,421 --> 01:23:20,415
Tomorrow we'll go
wherever you want to go.

1023
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:25,923
June, why don't you
just go on home?

1024
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:30,564
We're married. Remember?

1025
01:23:30,669 --> 01:23:34,799
Besides, I-- I want to
be with you.

1026
01:23:34,907 --> 01:23:37,205
Why?

1027
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:40,039
I need you, Eric.

1028
01:23:40,145 --> 01:23:43,239
- You need me?
- Yes.

1029
01:23:43,349 --> 01:23:47,479
You're my husband,
and I'm your wife.

1030
01:23:47,586 --> 01:23:51,852
Right out of a book.
Again.

1031
01:23:51,957 --> 01:23:56,223
Yes. Out of a book.

1032
01:23:56,328 --> 01:24:00,196
"We were born to tread
the Earth as angels...

1033
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:04,929
to seek out a heaven
this side of the sky...

1034
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:10,236
but they who race alone shall stumble
in the dark and fall from grace."

1035
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:15,245
Go on. Sounds good.

1036
01:24:15,347 --> 01:24:19,340
"Then love alone can make
the fallen angel rise...

1037
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:24,915
for only two together
can enter paradise."

1038
01:25:54,146 --> 01:25:58,845
Four-and-a-half-minute eggs. I certainly
married a man with a peculiar taste.

1039
01:25:58,951 --> 01:26:01,715
You can still get out of it.

1040
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:04,050
Promise me you'll never
say that again.

1041
01:26:04,156 --> 01:26:06,989
Okay. I promise.

1042
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:09,617
It's 10:00.
The bank just opened.

1043
01:26:09,728 --> 01:26:11,753
Let's go.

1044
01:26:13,932 --> 01:26:15,957
<i>Papers! Get your morning papers!</i>

1045
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:21,162
<i>Get your morning papers here.</i>
<i>Early edition papers.</i>

1046
01:26:21,273 --> 01:26:24,071
<i>Early edition paper.</i>

1047
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:26,770
<i>Papers! Morning papers.</i>
<i>Paper, sir?</i>

1048
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,139
You wait here.
I'll be right back.

1049
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:32,308
- <i>Shine, sir?</i>
- All right.

1050
01:26:32,418 --> 01:26:34,784
Morning papers.
Early edition papers.

1051
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,312
Papers! Early edition papers.

1052
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,585
Morning papers here!
Papers!

1053
01:26:42,695 --> 01:26:45,493
- Mrs. Stanton.
- Yes?

1054
01:26:47,199 --> 01:26:49,326
Will you come with us,
please?

1055
01:27:08,654 --> 01:27:11,680
<i>Get your morning papers!</i>

1056
01:27:17,696 --> 01:27:19,721
Here.

1057
01:27:19,832 --> 01:27:22,528
But I ain't finished yet.

1058
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:25,967
Now let's be sensible.
We've been here for hours.

1059
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:35,007
<i>Tell us where he is.</i>
<i>We're bound to find him soon.</i>

1060
01:27:42,321 --> 01:27:44,551
Mrs. Stanton,
you're not helping him or yourself...

1061
01:27:44,656 --> 01:27:47,648
getting mixed up in this murder
as an accessory after the fact.

1062
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,662
If he doesn't want to come back,
he must have a reason.

1063
01:27:51,764 --> 01:27:55,461
What reason could an innocent man have?
Assuming he's innocent.

1064
01:27:55,567 --> 01:27:58,001
He is.
He could never have done it.

1065
01:27:58,103 --> 01:28:01,436
How can you say that?

1066
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:03,508
You know very little
about him.

1067
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:07,101
He came into town a total stranger,
and within a week he married you.

1068
01:28:07,212 --> 01:28:09,544
All to his credit
of course.

1069
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:12,607
But why this trust in him?

1070
01:28:12,718 --> 01:28:17,985
A man who went out to see another woman
the night of your marriage.

1071
01:28:18,090 --> 01:28:20,524
That's between the two of us.

1072
01:28:24,396 --> 01:28:26,728
Ask Miss Clara Mills
to come in.

1073
01:28:29,067 --> 01:28:31,092
Miss Mills, please.

1074
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:38,668
- June.
- Sit down, Miss Mills.

1075
01:28:46,318 --> 01:28:49,287
In your sworn statement
you identified this envelope...

1076
01:28:49,388 --> 01:28:51,481
which was found in
your safe-deposit box...

1077
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:53,854
as the one
Mr. Stanton gave you.

1078
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:56,393
Would you please
repeat that for your sister?

1079
01:28:56,495 --> 01:28:58,486
Yes.

1080
01:28:58,597 --> 01:29:02,158
This is the envelope he gave me
after they were married in San Francisco.

1081
01:29:02,267 --> 01:29:04,462
Why did he want you
to put it away?

1082
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:06,629
He said it contained
something valuable.

1083
01:29:06,738 --> 01:29:08,899
Mm-hmm.

1084
01:29:09,007 --> 01:29:12,875
Would you care to see your husband's
valuable property, Mrs. Stanton?

1085
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:20,182
A blank piece of paper.

1086
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:25,154
Now, why would a man want to put a blank
piece of paper in your safe-deposit box?

1087
01:29:25,257 --> 01:29:27,418
I'll tell you.

1088
01:29:27,526 --> 01:29:30,723
It gives him the excuse to open the box--
to steal your money--

1089
01:29:30,829 --> 01:29:35,528
No, he wouldn't. Whatever he did,
he-- he did because he was confused.

1090
01:29:35,634 --> 01:29:39,730
He knew what he was doing.
He wanted that money so he
could run away with that girl.

1091
01:29:39,838 --> 01:29:44,537
- But he didn't run away with her.
- No. He made the mistake
of coming back a married man...

1092
01:29:44,643 --> 01:29:47,544
and she didn't want to have
anything to do with married men.

1093
01:29:47,646 --> 01:29:50,740
- They had an argument, and he killed her.
- You're only assuming that.

1094
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:52,840
- You have no proof.
- All right.

1095
01:29:52,951 --> 01:29:56,284
But why shield a man who lied to you,
who wanted to steal from you...

1096
01:29:56,388 --> 01:29:59,585
when you have positive proof
that he married you for your money?

1097
01:29:59,691 --> 01:30:03,525
He didn't lie to me, and he isn't guilty.
I know he isn't.

1098
01:30:03,629 --> 01:30:05,790
He only ran away
because he had to.

1099
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:08,230
He's always had to run away--
all his life--

1100
01:30:08,333 --> 01:30:12,565
even as a child when he was beaten
for things he didn't do.

1101
01:30:12,671 --> 01:30:14,764
But he won't come back
because of you.

1102
01:30:14,873 --> 01:30:18,309
Because you won't give him a chance.
You only think the worst of him.

1103
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:21,208
Trying to make him guilty
of murder when he didn't do it!

1104
01:30:21,313 --> 01:30:23,838
I tell ya! He didn't do it!
He didn't do it!

1105
01:30:27,419 --> 01:30:29,478
Take her home now.

1106
01:30:32,557 --> 01:30:35,151
You're responsible
she doesn't leave the house.

1107
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,570
Not the same, Mr. Judd.

1108
01:30:52,678 --> 01:30:55,078
I think I'll sell the place.

1109
01:31:08,226 --> 01:31:10,922
Hello, Pop.
Some coffee, please.

1110
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:25,043
I knew you'd be back.

1111
01:31:25,143 --> 01:31:27,304
Yeah.

1112
01:31:27,412 --> 01:31:30,813
Well, drink your coffee,
and we'll go down to the chief of police.

1113
01:31:30,916 --> 01:31:32,941
Thanks.

1114
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,945
Enjoy San Francisco?

1115
01:31:38,757 --> 01:31:41,624
Sure. How come
you didn't go after me?

1116
01:31:41,727 --> 01:31:44,161
I didn't have to.

1117
01:31:44,262 --> 01:31:48,631
And how come there wasn't a word
about Stella's murder in the papers?

1118
01:31:48,734 --> 01:31:51,703
- Why are you holding it back?
- Professional reasons.

1119
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:55,569
And was it for professional reasons
you beat up Atkins...

1120
01:31:55,674 --> 01:31:58,666
when all the time
you knew he was innocent?

1121
01:31:58,777 --> 01:32:02,213
You don't seem to appreciate
my methods, Mr. Stanton.

1122
01:32:02,314 --> 01:32:04,373
Frankly, no.

1123
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:06,883
That's what
brought me back.

1124
01:32:06,985 --> 01:32:09,920
You know, I got worrying
about you in San Francisco.

1125
01:32:10,022 --> 01:32:12,582
About me?

1126
01:32:12,691 --> 01:32:17,651
Yes, Mr. Judd. You know, you ought to stay
home nights with your bad health...

1127
01:32:17,763 --> 01:32:19,856
not walk the streets.

1128
01:32:19,965 --> 01:32:24,026
Like the night you said you saw me
looking for Stella.

1129
01:32:24,136 --> 01:32:26,195
More coffee, Pop.

1130
01:32:26,304 --> 01:32:30,001
You know, you weren't strong enough
to keep on working on the New York force.

1131
01:32:30,108 --> 01:32:32,508
Why are you working so hard
on this case?

1132
01:32:32,611 --> 01:32:36,103
- Maybe you better slow down.
- Don't you worry about me.

1133
01:32:36,214 --> 01:32:38,205
I'm okay.

1134
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:41,717
I said I wanted more coffee, Pop.
Get it.

1135
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,914
I don't worry about you, Mr. Judd.
Not anymore.

1136
01:32:45,023 --> 01:32:50,393
Not since I called a friend of mine
in the D.A.'s office in New York.

1137
01:32:50,495 --> 01:32:54,522
He assured me you were in perfect health
when you left there.

1138
01:32:54,633 --> 01:32:59,036
They only retired you from the force
because you ruined another man's health.

1139
01:32:59,137 --> 01:33:02,038
Almost killed him
in a routine investigation.

1140
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:05,632
They would have sent you up
if you hadn't had such a good record.

1141
01:33:05,744 --> 01:33:08,645
That was before you started
to enjoy your work too much.

1142
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:11,443
Wearing gloves, you know.
And what's more, I checked up on--

1143
01:33:11,550 --> 01:33:13,950
That's enough.

1144
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:16,612
Save it for the chief.

1145
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:18,985
There you are, Pop.

1146
01:33:19,091 --> 01:33:21,150
Oh, you remember
that watch?

1147
01:33:21,259 --> 01:33:23,921
The one with the three diamonds
that belonged to Stella.

1148
01:33:24,029 --> 01:33:27,590
- Ever find out who bought it for her?
- Perhaps.

1149
01:33:27,699 --> 01:33:29,929
You know, you made
your fatal mistake, Judd...

1150
01:33:30,035 --> 01:33:32,833
when you had June arrested
up in San Francisco.

1151
01:33:32,938 --> 01:33:35,304
Oh, you scared me
at first all right.

1152
01:33:35,407 --> 01:33:39,138
But then I stopped,
and I began to think.

1153
01:33:39,244 --> 01:33:42,077
And I kept right on thinking
about that watch.

1154
01:33:42,180 --> 01:33:45,479
And I started a little
routine investigation of my own.

1155
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:49,418
The result is the Walton Police
will get a wire from San Francisco.

1156
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:51,989
They'll know who bought
that watch by tomorrow morning.

1157
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:55,321
That is,
unless you admit it tonight.

1158
01:33:55,427 --> 01:33:58,157
Shall we go?
Oh, I came in a police car.

1159
01:33:58,263 --> 01:34:01,562
They're waiting outside.
I thought it would be more convenient.

1160
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:05,560
Sit down.

1161
01:34:07,806 --> 01:34:09,865
You don't mind
if I finish my coffee.

1162
01:34:09,975 --> 01:34:12,967
You're insane, Judd.
The police are waiting right outside.

1163
01:34:13,078 --> 01:34:15,546
Perhaps I am insane.

1164
01:34:19,451 --> 01:34:23,785
Perhaps this might have been the perfect
crime if I hadn't dropped the watch.

1165
01:34:23,889 --> 01:34:25,857
Although I doubt it.

1166
01:34:25,957 --> 01:34:29,017
- There's always some slip.
- Yeah. There always is.

1167
01:34:31,062 --> 01:34:33,724
You understand.

1168
01:34:33,832 --> 01:34:36,460
You know what she was like.

1169
01:34:36,568 --> 01:34:39,696
You couldn't
get away from her either.

1170
01:34:39,804 --> 01:34:42,500
Two years
I came in here and drank coffee...

1171
01:34:42,607 --> 01:34:45,838
just to get
a look at her.

1172
01:34:45,944 --> 01:34:48,435
Day after day
for two years.

1173
01:34:49,614 --> 01:34:52,378
Insane. Perhaps.

1174
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:55,009
Those evenings when
she went out with other men...

1175
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:59,386
while I was waiting for her
in the shadow of the porch.

1176
01:34:59,491 --> 01:35:02,392
Remember three nights ago
when you brought her home...

1177
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:05,190
and kissed her?

1178
01:35:05,297 --> 01:35:07,822
I was standing there.

1179
01:35:08,934 --> 01:35:11,926
Insane. Perhaps.

1180
01:35:12,037 --> 01:35:15,336
Night before last,
when she was out with Atkins.

1181
01:35:16,975 --> 01:35:19,068
After he left,
I went up.

1182
01:35:19,177 --> 01:35:23,011
When she told me she wouldn't wait any
longer for my wife to give me a divorce...

1183
01:35:23,114 --> 01:35:27,175
that she was going to marry that
slot machine operator the next morning...

1184
01:35:27,285 --> 01:35:30,220
I hit her.

1185
01:35:30,322 --> 01:35:33,086
Unfortunately
I didn't remember my ring.

1186
01:35:34,826 --> 01:35:37,351
Get out of the way,
Mr. Stanton! I'm gonna kill him!

1187
01:35:37,462 --> 01:35:40,920
He murdered Stella!
I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill him!

1188
01:35:49,874 --> 01:35:51,933
Let's go.

1189
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:14,924
You gotta forget it, Pop.

1190
01:36:18,003 --> 01:36:20,471
No. I'll never
forget Stella.

1191
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:23,006
You will.

1192
01:36:23,108 --> 01:36:25,804
I felt the same way
myself until--

1193
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:28,936
Ah, you'll find yourself, Pop.

1194
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:38,217
<i>Eric.</i>

1195
01:36:46,531 --> 01:36:48,931
- Where to?
- Home.

in such a hurry to get rid of me?</font>

69
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you rent the room out?
- No, l got other ideas for your room</font>

70
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it rhymes with "home theater."</font>

lt's your little baby booties.</font>

- You see this, Dad? This is how</font>

74
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins</font>

75
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,895
<font face="Comic Sans MS">goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?</font>

76
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!</font>

77
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,568

not just big ones.</font>

78

You'll never know it's us.</font>

83
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,744
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can't do that, Mom.
- Would you let the kid breathe,</font>

84
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,621
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.</font>

85
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,248
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.</font>

86
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:45,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.</font>

87
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,420

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?</font>

90
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,135
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
lt's not a rap video.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's just like a coach thing.</font>

92
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:58,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.</font>

93
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:03,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.</font>

94
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the first Witwicky

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now l'm crying again! This sucks!</font>

96
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be okay, Ma.</font>

97
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's just going to be,</font>

98
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:19,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,</font>

99
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">going out to handle the world
on his own.</font>

100
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,623

- Yeah.</font>

101
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,293
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mojo, no dominating Frankie!</font>

102
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!</font>

103
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll see a lot of that in college, too.</font>

104
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you talking about, Dad?
- There's gonna be a lot of women there.</font>

105
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well,
l'm a one-woman kind of guy.</font>

106
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,221

107
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,932
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?</font>

108
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,268
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're no different
than any other couple your age.</font>

109
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except we discovered
an alien race together.</font>

110
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?</font>

111
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, listen, l know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?</font>

112
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second. Who could that be?</font>

113
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ln 2 weeks, it could be Muffy.</font>

114
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, beautiful.</font>

115
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,544
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?</font>

116
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure?
l'm not hearing a lot of conviction.</font>

117
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, l am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.</font>

118
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.</font>

119
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:22,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guess what? l made you
a long-distance relationship kit.</font>

120
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, l got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.</font>

121
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All Witwicky, all the time.</font>

122
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And l got you a couple souvenirs
from the event</font>

123
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.</font>

124
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,775
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Some mixes and candles and stuff.
- Sounds cute. l can't wait.</font>

125
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?</font>

126
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?</font>

127
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Of course, l kept it, Mikaela.</font>

128
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's like my Super Bowl jersey.
l bled in this thing.</font>

129
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
- No, it's not that.</font>

130
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.</font>

131
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,708
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?</font>

132
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really should come with me.</font>

133
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got cheap apartments
near campus.</font>

134
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's not gonna happen
until l get my man-child father,</font>

135
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fresh out of prison, back on his feet.</font>

136
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?</font>

137
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Next to the camshafts.
- l love it when you say "camshafts."</font>

138
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whisper it to me.</font>

139
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Camshafts.</font>

142
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.</font>

143
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,738
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l guess we're not breaking up.
l'll be over in 20.</font>

144
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,492
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mikaela, l think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.</font>

145

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam?</font>

146

<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a fire!</font>

147
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, we got a fire!</font>

148
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire!</font>

149
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?</font>

150
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just stop?</font>

151
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:18,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, okay, l'll stop. You carry this shit!</font>

152

153
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- l don't want to go anywhere with you.</font>

154

<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't wanna go to France with you.</font>

155
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't wanna go
around the corner with you.</font>

156

<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'll call you from Paris.</font>

158
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:50,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is all the racket?</font>

159
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:51,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam?</font>

160
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad!</font>

161
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What was that?
- That's the whole kitchen!</font>

162

<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.</font>

166

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy Mother!</font>

167
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- Whatever.</font>

168
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get in the garage now!</font>

169
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
- Dogs out! Get the dogs out!</font>

170
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:59,022
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?</font>

171
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My house is on fire!</font>

172
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...very important.
- What happened?</font>

173
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here. Listen, l need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.</font>

174

- Just take it.</font>

175
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,252
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
- Yes, Mom. Yeah.</font>

176
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,504

- Hi.</font>

177
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An old furnace, l think.
- From a waffle iron.</font>

178
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you go, he goes. l cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!</font>

179
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,346
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Judy... National security.</font>

180
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,975
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.</font>

181
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?</font>

182
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine. lf the government's paying,
l want a pool and a hot tub!</font>

183
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,067
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And l'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!</font>

184
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:51,283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
- He still having voice problems?</font>

185
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's playing it up.</font>

186
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bee, l want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?</font>

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm so excited and l just can't hide it</font>

188
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:02,502
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, l'm not taking you with me.</font>

189
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm gonna wait outside, okay?</font>

190
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l meant to tell you about this earlier.</font>

191
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.</font>

192
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.</font>

193
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l know, and if it was up to me,
l'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.</font>

194
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,978
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.</font>

195
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:24,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.</font>

196
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.</font>

197
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just look at me, please?</font>

198
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.</font>

199
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? You did your job.
Look, l'm safe now.</font>

200
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.</font>

201
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why l'm going to college,</font>

202
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and l can't do that with you.</font>

203
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's not the last time l'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.</font>

204
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:51,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.</font>

205
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you'll always be my first car.</font>

206
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love you, Bee.</font>

207
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:05,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

208
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.</font>

209
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop. Stop.</font>

210
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Stop, l'm okay.</font>

211
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,865
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

212
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:17,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?</font>

213
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,538
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.</font>

214
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And?
- And l'll do anything for you.</font>

215
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,543
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And?</font>

216
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l think Sam's about to say the L-word.
- Let's go, kiddo!</font>

217
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:28,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice timing, Dad.</font>

218
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l adore you.</font>

219
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,385
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the word that l want</font>

220
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to hear right now.
- What are you talking about?</font>

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's the same word as the other word.</font>

222
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt's not the same word.
- Look, if l say the other word now</font>

223
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus</font>

224
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.</font>

225
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but l haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.</font>

226
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.</font>

227
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?</font>

228
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:56,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt can be.
- l hate that it's working.</font>

229
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can l have a kiss?</font>

230
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to make it work, l promise.</font>

231
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.</font>

232
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Retrieve it.</font>

233
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.</font>

234
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.</font>

235
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
- No, l don't...</font>

236
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hold up.
- Those are nice.</font>

237
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.</font>

238
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:17,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!</font>

239
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Time to get my sexy on with the green.
- Green? No, green is mine!</font>

240
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l call green!</font>

241
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l got the green.
- That hurt, man.</font>

242
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's supposed to hurt. lt's an ass-kicking.</font>

243
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Present arms!</font>

244
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Director Galloway, what an honor.
l'd love to show you around,</font>

245
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you gotta be
on the classified access list.</font>

246
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,784
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l am now. Presidential order, Major.</font>

247
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,787
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l got a message
for your classified space buddies!</font>

248
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys made a mess of Shanghai.</font>

249
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,337
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS</font>

250
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.</font>

251
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure link to JCS is up, Major.</font>

252
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.</font>

253
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- General?
- Will, I saw the Shanghai op.</font>

254
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We had a rough day out there.
- Yes, sir.</font>

255
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.</font>

256
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now with your permission,
l can't let you see him,</font>

257
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:01,051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but l would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.</font>

258
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,177
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Proceed.</font>

259
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta wonder,</font>

260
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,867
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if God made us in his image,
who made him?</font>

261
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General, our alliance
has countermanded</font>

262
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 Decepticon incursions this year,</font>

263
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">each on a different continent.</font>

264
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're clearly searching
around the world for something,</font>

265
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:41,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but last night's encounter
came with a warning.</font>

266
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Fallen shall rise again."</font>

267
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:46,221
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Fallen." Meaning what?</font>

268
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race</font>

269
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.</font>

270
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me!</font>

271
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,986
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,</font>

272
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:04,614
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?</font>

273
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.</font>

274
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:10,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The President just appointed him liaison.</font>

275
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, l guess l didn't get that memo.</font>

276
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.</font>

277
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,255
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.</font>

278
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all the damage in Shanghai,</font>

279
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.</font>

280
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,</font>

281
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:39,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.</font>

282
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:43,528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.</font>

283
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt would absolutely bring
more harm than good.</font>

284
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:50,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who are you to judge
what's best for us?</font>

285
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side</font>

286
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the field for 2 years.</font>

287
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,292
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.</font>

288
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.</font>

289
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't tempt me.</font>

290
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the newest members of your team.</font>

291
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Easy.
- l understand they arrived here</font>

292
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after you sent a message into space,</font>

293
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.</font>

294
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. lt was vetted right here.</font>

295
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:20,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team</font>

296
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:23,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has always been above reproach.</font>

297
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:26,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President</font>

298
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:31,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.</font>

299
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,163
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, what do we know so far?</font>

300
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:41,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,</font>

301
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:45,340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,</font>

302
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.</font>

303
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark</font>

304
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is locked in an electromagnetic vault</font>

305
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:59,854
<font face="Comic Sans MS">here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the worId.</font>

306
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:04,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Decepticons, we have located the shard.</font>

307
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,</font>

308
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:13,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, there's only one clear conclusion!</font>

309
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:16,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You! The Autobots!</font>

310
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,332
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're here to hunt you!</font>

311
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?</font>

312
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:25,338
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Fallen shall rise again"?</font>

313
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt sounds to me
like something's coming.</font>

314
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served</font>

315
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:36,266
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by denying you further asylum
on our planet,</font>

316
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will you leave peacefully?</font>

317
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:46,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freedom is your right. lf you make
that request, we will honor it.</font>

318
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:52,574
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But before your President decides,
please ask him this.</font>

319
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:57,537
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if we leave and you're wrong?</font>

320
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good question.</font>

321
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!</font>

322
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l feel smarter already.</font>

323
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Ron, can you smell it?
- Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.</font>

324
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:26,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, cheapo!
- Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.</font>

325
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just go ahead and check out your room.</font>

326
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, go.</font>

327
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

328
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:41,206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You must be Sam, right? l'm Leo.
- Hey.</font>

329
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, l already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?</font>

330
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:49,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That side.
- l already chose that side.</font>

331
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.</font>

332
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if l'm a normal guy.</font>

333
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.</font>

334
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.</font>

335
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.</font>

336
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No criminal record, won't steal anything.</font>

337
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lncluding girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.</font>

338
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got a girlfriend?
- l do. You?</font>

339
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not a chance. You a techie?</font>

340
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,735
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?</font>

341
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Server's almost online, Leo.
- Network's up and running.</font>

342
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beautiful, that's what l like to hear.</font>

343
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,659
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my lT gurus.</font>

344
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal.com.</font>

345
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's me, l'm sure you've heard of it.</font>

346
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, l haven't.
- Well, that sucks.</font>

347
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is all this for?
- See where l'm going, bro.</font>

348
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,254
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, call me gross,
l want to be a baby billionaire.</font>

349
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:31,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kitten calendars.
That's where l started. Look at me now.</font>

350
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got to have dreams, bro.</font>

351
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!</font>

352
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!</font>

353
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's "FTJ"?
- "Fuel the Jet."</font>

354
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuel the Jet, bro.</font>

355
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">FTJ. FTJ, legit!</font>

356
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,774
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see that? Did you see that?</font>

357
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."</font>

358
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:54,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't believe the hype, bro.</font>

359
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like the alien robots in L.A.
2 years ago that everyone covered up.</font>

360
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, l saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing</font>

361
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...</font>

362
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt looks fake to me.
- Dude, it's not fake.</font>

363
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:08,501
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lnternet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.</font>

364
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt looks fake.
- No, man, l've seen them.</font>

365
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're, like, these robots...
- Look, look, it's fake.</font>

366
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?</font>

367
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And l wasn't there,</font>

368
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- so l can't comment or speculate.
- No.</font>

369
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?</font>

370
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!</font>

371
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Which sack?
- The ball sack.</font>

372
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:28,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, what kind of tool are you?</font>

373
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?</font>

374
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.</font>

375
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow me.</font>

376
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leo, bad news!</font>

377
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,657
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.</font>

and he stole it!</font>

381

and thieving hits forever.</font>

382
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, l read your file.
l'm poor, you're poor.</font>

383
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,089
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.</font>

384

of just pure champion stuff.</font>

387
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?</font>

388
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me</font>

389
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,021
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause l'll do it!</font>

390
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:13,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can l switch out?</font>

391
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:18,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?</font>

392
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, here we go.

white boys with the dreadlocks.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!</font>

725

with her nasty alien probe?</font>

735
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies</font>

758
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,376

01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.</font>

828
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:04,924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?</font>

829
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One insect among 7 billion!
- Shut up!</font>

830
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:13,057
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could be anywhere.</font>

831
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:16,602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we will force them
to find him for us!</font>

832
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:20,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's time for the world
to know of our presence.</font>

833
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No more disguises. No mercy!</font>

834
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:27,571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The time has come
for my master's arrival.</font>

835
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:36,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Decepticons, mobilize. lt is time.</font>

836
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:56,725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking French is so exciting!</font>

837
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, who is this?</font>

838
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? l mean, bonsoir!</font>

839
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:07,861
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? Who is this?
- Where is the boy?</font>

840
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,866
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Pete's sakes. l'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.</font>

841
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez!</font>

842
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,785
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are invading my space.
l'm gonna have to drop you.</font>

843
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you get out of here?</font>

844
01:05:58,163 --> 01:06:00,414
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.</font>

845
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:01,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l want to try new things.</font>

846
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like Canadian goose poop.</font>

847
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:06,962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's nasty.</font>

848
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:22,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Revenge is mine.</font>

849
01:07:39,723 --> 01:07:41,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

850
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:45,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...definitely not a plane...</font>

851
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, carriers don't just sink.</font>

852
01:07:48,148 --> 01:07:51,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...</font>

853
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Negative. NORAD confirmed,</font>

854
01:07:53,653 --> 01:07:57,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.</font>

855
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:15,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Citizens of the human hive,</font>

856
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,261
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your leaders have withheld the truth.</font>

857
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:22,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are not alone in this universe.</font>

858
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:26,685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have lived among you, hidden,</font>

859
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but no more.</font>

860
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:35,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,</font>

861
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:40,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless you turn over this boy.</font>

862
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:51,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lf you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.</font>

863
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we're hearing
from the German government</font>

864
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:57,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that the worId broadcast
was a satellite hacking.</font>

865
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,</font>

866
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:03,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.</font>

867
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Obama
is being flown to a bunker</font>

868
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">somewhere in the middle
of the United States</font>

869
01:09:07,352 --> 01:09:11,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.</font>

870
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:17,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.</font>

871
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:20,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">WorIdwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,</font>

872
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that number could climb.</font>

873
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's still too early to tell.</font>

874
01:09:23,535 --> 01:09:25,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"</font>

875
01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:28,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The FBl is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.</font>

876
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We believe they have information
about the attacks.</font>

877
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The FBl, ClA and lnterpol</font>

878
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:37,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are all seeking the cooperation
of worIdwide law enforcement.</font>

879
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:39,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.</font>

880
01:09:39,884 --> 01:09:42,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They have a traffic-camera spotting...
- They have a picture of me, man.</font>

881
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:46,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're dead, bro.
FBl, ClA, we are wanted fugitives now!</font>

882
01:09:46,266 --> 01:09:47,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l just need you to focus</font>

883
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:48,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.</font>

884
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,018
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?</font>

885
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.</font>

886
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,814
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you see this?
- What?</font>

887
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,569
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?</font>

888
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:00,612
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, l'm not even with you guys!</font>

889
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, l'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...</font>

890
01:10:03,116 --> 01:10:04,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Enough is...
- Yo, Leo!</font>

891
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, l swear.</font>

892
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?</font>

893
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:10,372
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l think he's scared.</font>

894
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?</font>

895
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:14,418
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk</font>

896
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what l mean?</font>

897
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? l'm hearing you.</font>

898
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:21,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? l'm right here and l can hear you!</font>

899
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?</font>

900
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l've had a hell of a day!</font>

901
01:10:26,306 --> 01:10:28,724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?</font>

902
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:29,933
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go whine to your boyfriend!</font>

903
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:32,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Sam, l know what l'm gonna do,
man. Look, l'm just going to go</font>

904
01:10:32,312 --> 01:10:33,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the authorities and tell them the truth.</font>

905
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, l had nothing to do with this.</font>

906
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:36,064
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, l'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, you wanted this, right?</font>

907
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.</font>

908
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wake up! You're in the middle of it!</font>

909
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.</font>

910
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:43,947
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop complaining.</font>

911
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:21,693
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the meaning of this?</font>

912
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:23,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You dare point a gun at me?</font>

913
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:27,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want a piece of me?
l will tear you apart!</font>

914
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!</font>

915
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,705
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.</font>

916
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:34,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell them to lower their weapons.</font>

917
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major, there's nothing l can do.
Talk to him.</font>

918
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:38,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.</font>

919
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations</font>

920
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:44,299
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.</font>

921
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.</font>

922
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, l'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</font>

923
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,223
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and l will raise you
a President of the United States.</font>

924
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l have operational command now.</font>

925
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:55,060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores</font>

926
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for which our soldiers
are paying the price.</font>

927
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,897
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The secret is out!</font>

928
01:11:58,982 --> 01:12:02,442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,</font>

929
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:04,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a coordinated military strategy.</font>

930
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:07,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fool is terribly misinformed.</font>

931
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:08,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.</font>

932
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,742
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What we need is to draw up battle plans</font>

933
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.</font>

934
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,579
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like what, handing over the kid?</font>

935
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:17,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All options are being considered.</font>

936
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:22,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.</font>

937
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:25,465
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There is no negotiating with them.
- l'm ordering you to stand down.</font>

938
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:29,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!</font>

939
01:12:29,721 --> 01:12:32,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.</font>

940
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go!</font>

941
01:12:36,436 --> 01:12:40,647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.</font>

942
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:43,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Autobots, report to hangar for transport.</font>

943
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:48,655
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lronhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.</font>

944
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing
that you could have done.</font>

945
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You okay?
- Yeah.</font>

946
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:22,564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bee, if you hate me, l understand.</font>

947
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,533
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l messed up. l'm sorry.</font>

948
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young fella, you are the person
l care about most in my life.</font>

949
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,626
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lf there's anything you need,
l won't be far away.</font>

950
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:48,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.</font>

951
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's some things
you just can't change.</font>

952
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:56,014
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!</font>

953
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm gonna make it right.
l'm going to turn myself in.</font>

954
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,853
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We... We've got to stick together.</font>

955
01:14:06,526 --> 01:14:10,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not going to do that.
- Yes, l am.</font>

956
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:18,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!</font>

957
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:22,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You two...
- Huh?</font>

958
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know the glyphs?</font>

959
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,586
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?</font>

960
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:31,383
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.</font>

961
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's some serious stuff, right there.</font>

962
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:36,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.</font>

963
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like a map to an Energon source!</font>

- Read?</font>

965

<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">lf you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.</font>

he's supposed to know.</font>

977

of your alien drawings or whatever.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.</font>

1009
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!</font>

1010
01:16:44,308 --> 01:16:46,101
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?</font>

1011

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt's my dream.
- Help her out.</font>

1012

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You live with your mama?</font>

1013
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:51,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, my mama lives with me.
lt's a big difference.</font>

1014
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:53,441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.</font>

1015
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,902

- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?</font>

1016
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did that happen? Don't answer.</font>

1017
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't know what you're hiding,
but l don't want anything to do with it.</font>

1018
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, good-bye. You never saw me.
l got bagels to schmear. Vanish.</font>

1019
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:05,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you give me 5 seconds?
Look, hold on, l need your help.</font>

1020
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,665

Look, l am slowly losing my mind.</font>

1022
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, l had a little crab-bot,</font>

1023
01:17:13,170 --> 01:17:15,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain</font>

1024
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:18,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!</font>

1025
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,052
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And on top of that, l'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?</font>

1026
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:23,305
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said it projected images
off your brain?</font>

1027
01:17:23,389 --> 01:17:25,974
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- Meat locker, now!</font>

1028
01:17:26,726 --> 01:17:27,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead pigs.</font>

1029
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,228
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're about to see is top secret.</font>

1030
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:33,023
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do not tell my mother.</font>

1031
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Swine flu. Not good.
- Now you know.</font>

1032
01:17:36,235 --> 01:17:39,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.</font>

1033
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sad little story.</font>

1034
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,823
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?</font>

1035
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:42,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?</font>

1036
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:46,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.</font>

1037
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.</font>

1038
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Cube-brain.</font>

1039
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:55,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?</font>

1040
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,504
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd you get these?</font>

1041
01:17:56,589 --> 01:18:00,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before l got fired,
l poached S-7's crown jewel,</font>

1042
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:05,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.</font>

1043
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:09,768
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.</font>

1044
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:11,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do l know?</font>

1045
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Archeologists found
these unexplained markings</font>

1046
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:16,608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in ancient ruins all over the world.</font>

1047
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">China. Egypt. Greece.</font>

1048
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shot in 1932.</font>

1049
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:23,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?</font>

1050
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?</font>

1051
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:31,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?</font>

1052
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Aliens. And l think some of them stayed.</font>

1053
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,129
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check this out. Project Black Knife.</font>

1054
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:43,093
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.</font>

1055
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.</font>

1056
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,058
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,</font>

1057
01:18:50,142 --> 01:18:53,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,</font>

1058
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:56,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that l was obsessed.</font>

1059
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,066
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me. Can you imagine that?</font>

1060
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.</font>

1061
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.</font>

1062
01:19:03,322 --> 01:19:06,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.</font>

1063
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:08,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?</font>

1064
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, the source is before them.</font>

1065
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:11,329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.</font>

1066
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:12,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's before them.</font>

1067
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,582
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.</font>

1068
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:18,044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.</font>

1069
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,213
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean,
l'm not on speaking terms with them.</font>

1070
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, l am.</font>

1071
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:28,054
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me out!</font>

1072
01:19:28,139 --> 01:19:30,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.</font>

1073
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:34,227
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!</font>

1074
01:19:34,311 --> 01:19:35,770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, behave!</font>

1075
01:19:35,855 --> 01:19:37,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.</font>

1076
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:39,566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And you're training him?
- l'm trying to.</font>

1077
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:43,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,</font>

1078
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,573
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.</font>

1079
01:19:47,158 --> 01:19:49,617
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?</font>

1080
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm sorry.
l'm so sorry about your eye, you know,</font>

1081
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:56,082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, if you're a good boy,
then l'm not gonna torch your other eye.</font>

1082
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:57,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? l'm not gonna torch it.</font>

1083
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:01,045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.</font>

1084
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1085
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l know that.
That's the language of the Primes.</font>

1086

<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't read it, but these guys...</font>

1087
01:20:11,265 --> 01:20:13,766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?</font>

1088
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:17,645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ls this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.</font>

1089
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:21,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. l don't know what.</font>

1090
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.</font>

1091
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And l know where to find them.
- Show us.</font>

1092

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1093

1096
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,551

- What is that?</font>

1097
01:20:49,428 --> 01:20:51,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? l wear them when l'm in a funk.</font>

1098
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:56,142
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So does Giambi, Jeter.
lt's a baseball thing. Okay.</font>

1099
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.</font>

1100
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.</font>

1101
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.</font>

1102
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.</font>

1103
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,695
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tricks the polygraph every time.</font>

1104
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:09,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.</font>

1105
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, listen, l can't do this.</font>

1106
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:14,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
l'm not gonna do this.</font>

1107
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,704
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Guards have guns. l don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid.</font>

1108
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,707
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.</font>

1109
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.</font>

1110
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The museum is now closing.</font>

1111
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!</font>

1112
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,092
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.</font>

1113
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:32,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir! l suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!</font>

1114
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:34,681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, man, l understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.</font>

1115
01:21:34,765 --> 01:21:36,683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right? Thumper dumper.
l got to go. All right.</font>

1116
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.</font>

1117
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pull your pants up and exit the building.
- l'm not going anywhere.</font>

1118
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:50,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got that paper, right, sir?
- You should be embarrassed.</font>

1119
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:52,282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a family museum, sir.</font>

1120
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:11,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is going on here?</font>

1121
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:16,347
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?</font>

1122
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:18,641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.</font>

1123
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just downed 5 guards.
5 guards.</font>

1124
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get your stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second here.</font>

1125
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l got to get the tracker, all right.</font>

1126
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,778
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Be good.
- l'm claustrophobic.</font>

1127
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.</font>

1128
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:57,889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He knows something.
- What?</font>

1129
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,015
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows something.</font>

1130
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:05,980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got what l got?</font>

1131
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:07,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Blackbird.</font>

1132
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There he is.</font>

1133
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:16,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!</font>

1134
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:20,328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.</font>

1135
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:29,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. lt's a Decepticon!</font>

1136
01:23:29,755 --> 01:23:31,923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Decepticon?
- Decepticon?</font>

1137
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:34,050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Behind the MiG now!</font>

1138
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:49,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?</font>

1139
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,694
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Answer me, pawns and knaves!</font>

1140
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:56,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!</font>

1141
01:23:57,324 --> 01:24:00,284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You little spinal-cord-based organisms!</font>

1142
01:24:01,412 --> 01:24:02,662
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bugger it!</font>

1143
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:07,667
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!</font>

1144
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prepare for remote systems override!</font>

1145
01:24:10,212 --> 01:24:12,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l tell you, this guy did not age well.
- l don't think he's gonna hurt us.</font>

1146
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l command these doors to open.</font>

1147
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,178
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fire! l said, fire!</font>

1148
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bollocks!</font>

1149
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,059
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Damn these worthless parts.
- Wait a second!</font>

1150
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:28,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ltchy, wretched rust in my arse!</font>

1151
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:32,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.</font>

1152
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:34,485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta catch that plane.</font>

1153
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:41,826
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right. l'm on a mission.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!</font>

1154
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,745
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What do you want?
- Look, we just want to talk!</font>

1155
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:45,580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l have no time to talk. l'm on a mission.</font>

1156
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:48,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am l on?</font>

1157
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Earth.
- Earth?</font>

1158
01:24:50,461 --> 01:24:55,506
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."</font>

1159
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?</font>

1160
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.</font>

1161
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:05,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well, l changed sides to the Autobots.
- What do you mean, "changed sides"?</font>

1162
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:08,811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's a choice.
lt's an intensely personal decision.</font>

1163
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:12,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?</font>

1164
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean you don't have to work</font>

1165
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?</font>

1166
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:19,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lf Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.</font>

1167
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm changing sides. l'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.</font>

1168
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Who's your little Autobot?
- You're cute.</font>

1169
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.</font>

1170
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,624
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?</font>

1171
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:30,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At least he's faithful, Sam.</font>

1172
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:33,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.</font>

1173
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,464
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just... Can you stop?</font>

1174
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:37,965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, what are you doing?
- lt's just something</font>

1175
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to think about. l won't argue with...
What were you saying?</font>

1176
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:44,138
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.</font>

1177
01:25:44,223 --> 01:25:45,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody shit the bed this morning.</font>

1178
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Look at this guy.
- l have issues of my own.</font>

1179
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,893
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it started with my mother!</font>

1180
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My ancestors
have been here for centuries.</font>

1181
01:25:51,522 --> 01:25:54,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.</font>

1182
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:56,818
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.</font>

1183
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:57,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing!</font>

1184
01:25:58,028 --> 01:26:01,697
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!</font>

1185
01:26:08,539 --> 01:26:09,539
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bollocks.</font>

1186
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:12,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My boosters are fried.</font>

1187
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,294
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l think we can help each other.</font>

1188
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:18,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know things l don't know.
l know things you don't know, l do.</font>

1189
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, l don't.</font>

1190
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:24,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l could do this all day.
lt comes in waves, these vivid symbols.</font>

1191
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:27,890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind</font>

1192
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Megatron wants what's in my mind.</font>

1193
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:33,145
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Him and someone called The Fallen.
- The Fallen? l know him.</font>

1194
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:36,482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.</font>

1195
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:40,361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's terrible to work for.
lt's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.</font>

1196
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,</font>

1197
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:43,531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fallen's search.</font>

1198
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:47,201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.</font>

1199
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:49,370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?</font>

1200
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:53,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!</font>

1201
01:27:20,819 --> 01:27:21,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that wasn't so bad.</font>

1202
01:27:21,987 --> 01:27:23,654
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l just hope we're still on the right planet.</font>

1203
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:25,698
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, that freaking hurt!</font>

1204
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:28,326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1205
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:36,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God.</font>

1206
01:27:41,298 --> 01:27:43,257
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.</font>

1207
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:47,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.</font>

1208
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, get off.</font>

1209
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, my balls.</font>

1210
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:54,852
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam!</font>

1211
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:59,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!</font>

1212
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:04,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? lt's Vegas.</font>

1213
01:28:04,196 --> 01:28:06,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You guys okay?
- Yeah.</font>

1214
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, l think we're in Vegas!</font>

1215
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:12,286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that l didn't get hurt!</font>

1216
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:15,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if l would have gotten hurt,</font>

1217
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:17,083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- you would have heard...
- Shut up.</font>

1218
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:21,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l told you l was opening a space bridge.
lt's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.</font>

1219
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:24,382
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.</font>

1220
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:26,217
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?</font>

1221
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!</font>

1222
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?</font>

1223
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:33,891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you tell us why we're in Egypt</font>

1224
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?</font>

1225
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:40,147
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This planet was visited
by our race once before,</font>

1226
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,984
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.</font>

1227
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,987
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,</font>

1228
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:48,656
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the lifeblood of our race.</font>

1229
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:53,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!</font>

1230
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:57,581
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?</font>

1231
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,584
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?</font>

1232
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:06,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.</font>

1233
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:11,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.</font>

1234
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:15,808
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt harvests Energon by destroying suns.</font>

1235
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:17,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?</font>

1236
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. You see, in the beginning,</font>

1237
01:29:19,646 --> 01:29:22,773
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there were 7 Primes,
our original leaders.</font>

1238
01:29:22,858 --> 01:29:26,944
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.</font>

1239
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:33,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,</font>

1240
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">until one of them tried to defy this rule.</font>

1241
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:40,374
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.</font>

1242
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:44,503
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He despised the human race</font>

1243
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:49,884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.</font>

1244
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:54,013
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key</font>

1245
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:57,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">called the Matrix of Leadership.</font>

1246
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:07,860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.</font>

1247
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:15,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,</font>

1248
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:20,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.</font>

1249
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:26,462
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ln the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away</font>

1250
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:29,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,</font>

1251
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:33,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a tomb we cannot find.</font>

1252
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:40,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.</font>

1253
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:42,603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Fallen knows where it is</font>

1254
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:48,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.</font>

1255
01:30:48,693 --> 01:30:50,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so how do we stop him?</font>

1256
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.</font>

1257
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Optimus Prime?</font>

1258
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you've met a Prime?</font>

1259
01:30:59,079 --> 01:31:02,164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, you must have met
a great descendant.</font>

1260
01:31:02,249 --> 01:31:05,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ls he alive, here on this planet?</font>

1261
01:31:06,086 --> 01:31:08,379
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sacrificed himself to save me.</font>

1262
01:31:08,839 --> 01:31:10,297
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, he's dead.</font>

1263
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:14,468
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.</font>

1264
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:18,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,</font>

1265
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,267
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus</font>

1266
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:22,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring him back to life?</font>

1267
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:27,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.</font>

1268
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?</font>

1269
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:34,446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.</font>

1270
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.</font>

1271
01:31:37,242 --> 01:31:42,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!</font>

1272
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,498
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Find the doorway!</font>

1273
01:31:44,583 --> 01:31:46,458
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go now! Go!</font>

1274
01:31:46,543 --> 01:31:49,461
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was my mission.
lt's your mission now.</font>

1275
01:31:49,546 --> 01:31:53,841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.</font>

1276
01:31:59,764 --> 01:32:01,682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, here's what my ClA contact says.</font>

1277
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf ofAqaba the "Dagger's Tip."</font>

1278
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:07,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- lt's part of the Red Sea.</font>

1279
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.</font>

1280
01:32:09,608 --> 01:32:13,444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.</font>

1281
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,905
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.</font>

1282
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?</font>

1283
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:19,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm gonna make a call.</font>

1284
01:32:22,621 --> 01:32:23,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got cops!</font>

1285
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,295
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l can't go to prison, guys.</font>

1286
01:32:35,217 --> 01:32:37,801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.</font>

1287
01:32:48,355 --> 01:32:50,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, stupid cops!</font>

1288
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.</font>

1289
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:56,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shut up or l'll blend my fist in your face.
- They're gone.</font>

1290
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:59,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we're running out of time.
l gotta make the call to Lennox...</font>

1291
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:00,532
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.</font>

1292
01:33:00,617 --> 01:33:03,244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.</font>

1293
01:33:03,328 --> 01:33:05,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ClA is all over this place!
- You're gonna call.</font>

1294
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay. That's a good idea.
- All right.</font>

1295
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:16,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean, l just had my mind
on other things,</font>

1296
01:33:16,675 --> 01:33:18,133
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like winding up in an Egyptian prison.</font>

1297
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:23,180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">NEST departure, 2100 hours.</font>

1298
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:28,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.</font>

1299
01:33:33,692 --> 01:33:35,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Major Lennox, phone call.</font>

1300
01:33:36,695 --> 01:33:39,780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lennox, l'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?</font>

1301
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,448
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need the truck. The truck.</font>

1302
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.</font>

1303
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:48,622
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.</font>

1304
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Back of a $1 bill.</font>

1305
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:57,006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.</font>

1306
01:33:57,090 --> 01:33:59,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. l got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.</font>

1307
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:01,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, who are you?</font>

1308
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,139
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. lt's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.</font>

1309
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,307
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!</font>

1310
01:34:06,391 --> 01:34:08,183
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move, move, move, move.</font>

1311
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:13,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.</font>

1312
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,607

1313
01:34:15,692 --> 01:34:18,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Egypt? Are you serious?</font>

1314
01:34:19,863 --> 01:34:20,946
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir.</font>

1315
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:28,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,</font>

1316
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?</font>

1317
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:34,251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, l don't know,
but we got to trust him.</font>

1318
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:37,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's go over it again.</font>

1319
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:40,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,</font>

1320
01:34:40,258 --> 01:34:42,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- the Three Kings...
- Will reveal the doorway.</font>

1321
01:34:42,635 --> 01:34:44,428
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what he said.
You know what it means?</font>

1322
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,055
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, what does it mean?
- l have no idea.</font>

1323
01:34:46,139 --> 01:34:47,931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.</font>

1324
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:49,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l don't have my passport.</font>

1325
01:34:51,811 --> 01:34:53,187
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Passport!</font>

1326

<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, chill. This is espionage time.
l can handle it.</font>

l'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.</font>

1329
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:17,086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great, a fricking Munchkin.</font>

1330
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.</font>

1331
01:35:28,473 --> 01:35:31,308
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Dagger's Tip? Right?</font>

1332
01:35:31,393 --> 01:35:33,894
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.</font>

1333
01:35:33,978 --> 01:35:37,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,</font>

We're tourists, from New York.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 kilometers.</font>

1337

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.</font>

1338
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l know. l know you from somewhere.
- Go, Yankees!</font>

1339
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:50,536
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it on the wire to the ClA.</font>

1340
01:35:54,916 --> 01:35:59,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Decepticons, boy's location detected.</font>

1341
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:11,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.</font>

1342
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,017
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.</font>

1343
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:25,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Awesome! l think aliens built that.</font>

1344
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:26,572
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah.</font>

1345
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Move it! Move it!</font>

1346
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:31,577
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?</font>

1347
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:34,746
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.</font>

1348
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:59,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.</font>

1349
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:04,401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.</font>

1350
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do they?
- Yeah.</font>

1351
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might as well just say it.</font>

1352
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:12,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies first.</font>

1353
01:37:14,412 --> 01:37:17,122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.</font>

1354
01:37:17,207 --> 01:37:20,334
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're really chivalrous.
- Why are you mad at me?</font>

1355
01:37:20,418 --> 01:37:23,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
Baby, l'm not... l'm not mad.</font>

1356
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:29,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you realize that l just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?</font>

1360

<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars</font>

1361

you love me.</font>

1363

1365
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- change the subject?
- Pyramids and stars.</font>

1366
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,786
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sam?
- Come with me really quick.</font>

1367
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:06,046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Simmons! Leo! Wake up!</font>

1368
01:38:09,342 --> 01:38:11,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?</font>

1369
01:38:11,719 --> 01:38:14,388
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. l was only in college for 2 days.
Remember that?</font>

1370
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:16,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Here. Get up. Up, up.
- What is he talking about?</font>

1371
01:38:21,896 --> 01:38:23,063
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you see those three stars?</font>

1372
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,898
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see
how the last one touches the horizon?</font>

1373
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:27,734
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.</font>

1374
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings</font>

1375
01:38:29,696 --> 01:38:32,489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,</font>

1376
01:38:32,574 --> 01:38:34,408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.</font>

1377
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:37,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.</font>

1378
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:52,259
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've had an engine malfunction.</font>

1379
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.</font>

1380
01:38:54,387 --> 01:38:56,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.</font>

1381
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:59,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?</font>

1382
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:02,019
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- All right, team, grab your chutes!
- Bailout like bailout?</font>

1383
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:07,065
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You familiar with the standard MC-4?
- Of course not!</font>

1384
01:39:07,150 --> 01:39:09,443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l've neverjumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!</font>

1385
01:39:09,527 --> 01:39:10,902
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute, is this really happening?</font>

1386
01:39:10,987 --> 01:39:12,779
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.</font>

1387
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:17,451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?</font>

1388
01:39:17,535 --> 01:39:19,161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.</font>

1389
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:23,123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.</font>

1390
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:26,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm just following orders to the letter.
lsn't that what you said?</font>

1391
01:39:27,003 --> 01:39:30,088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.</font>

1392
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:36,303
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that? What was that?</font>

1393
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:38,722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not good. Come on.</font>

1394
01:39:39,724 --> 01:39:41,224
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right this way!
- l can't jump out of an airplane!</font>

1395
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:43,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l have an ulcer! No, no.
- Come on. lt's okay.</font>

1396
01:39:43,728 --> 01:39:45,979
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l really can't do this.
What are you doing...</font>

1397
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:48,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here! Come here.</font>

1398
01:39:48,650 --> 01:39:52,903
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why aren't you wearing your chute?
- Because l have to secure the VlPs first.</font>

1399
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:57,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, l want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that l say.</font>

1400
01:39:57,283 --> 01:40:00,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.</font>

1401
01:40:00,328 --> 01:40:02,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,</font>

1402
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,665
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.</font>

1403
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, are you listening?
- l can't hear what...</font>

1404
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,335
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop that!
- All right. All right.</font>

1405
01:40:08,419 --> 01:40:10,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,</font>

1406
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:13,131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it pulls the pin and opens the main.</font>

1407
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:15,258
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Red's your backup, blue's your primary.</font>

1408
01:40:15,343 --> 01:40:19,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l want you to pull the blue.
l need you to pull it really hard!</font>

1409
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!</font>

1410
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He say good-bye?
- No, he didn't even say good-bye.</font>

1411
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:30,565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">General, we're loaded and ready.</font>

1412
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in 5 minutes.</font>

1413
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:36,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excellent.
- Sir, you need to see this now.</font>

1414
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have we checked these coordinates?
- Egypt, sir.</font>

1415
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:44,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're airdropping in.
- You've got to be kidding me.</font>

1416
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:45,497
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows something.</font>

1417
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.</font>

1418
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:50,377
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy that.</font>

1419
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:52,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ClA just got a hit on the boy,</font>

1420
01:40:53,464 --> 01:40:55,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">100 miles from the location
on that little note there.</font>

1421
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:56,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's getting hotter.</font>

1422
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:03,807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lt's gotta be around here somewhere.</font>

1423
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:27,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see the size of this?</font>

1424
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You see this?
- Spectacular.</font>

1425
01:41:31,836 --> 01:41:34,296
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing. Look at that.</font>

1426
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- lt's here somewhere, guys.
- Yeah, why?</font>

1427
01:41:46,934 --> 01:41:48,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird</font>

1428
01:41:48,561 --> 01:41:50,061
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?</font>

1429
01:41:50,146 --> 01:41:54,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ln his defense, this is the biggest
doorway l've ever seen in my entire life.</font>

1430
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:58,445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?</font>

1431
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:00,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,</font>

1432
01:42:00,198 --> 01:42:01,615
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that archeologists
have been here before?</font>

1433
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:02,783
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's nothing here.</font>

1434
01:42:02,867 --> 01:42:05,243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.</font>

1435
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,454
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow</font>

1436
01:42:07,538 --> 01:42:09,706
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!</font>

1437
01:42:09,791 --> 01:42:12,167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!</font>

1438

- lt is over. lt's done.</font>

1439
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?</font>

1440
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,174
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?</font>

1441
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:21,218
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Killed Megatron. How about that?</font>

1442
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:22,344
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he didn't get the job done,</font>

1443
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:23,970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know what l mean,
'cause he's back now...</font>

1444
01:42:24,055 --> 01:42:26,973
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you scared?
- Scared? Scared of your ugly face!</font>

1445
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:29,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">l'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!</font>

1446
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it, then! Get off me!</font>

1447
01:42:31,395 --> 01:42:34,481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- l'll change your face around!
- l'll get all up in that ass!</font>

1448
01:42:34,565 --> 01:42:35,982
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring it!</font>

1449
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:37,901
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys!</font>

1450
01:42:39,237 --> 01:42:40,821
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You like the way that feels?
- That didn't hurt.</font>

1451

1452
01:42:42,532 --> 01:42:44,908
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on, Bumblebee!
- Bumblebee, listen.</font>

1453

1454
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. The symbols.</font>

1455
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:09,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bee! Shoot it.</font>

1456
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:38,128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Check this out.

1457
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:40,380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

1458
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.</font>

1459
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:45,427
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The tomb of the Primes.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hear that?</font>

1466
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">US Air Force! C-17s!</font>

1467

- You can't bring him back, Sam.</font>

1468

<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's nothing left.
- Look! Look around you.</font>

1469
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,</font>

1470
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:52,452
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to just have it end like this.</font>

1471
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a reason that we are here.</font>

1472
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:58,166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.</font>

1473
01:45:04,048 --> 01:45:06,341
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's after me
because of what l know,</font>

1474
01:45:08,636 --> 01:45:11,846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and what l know is that
this is going to work.</font>

1475
01:45:12,306 --> 01:45:15,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How do you know it's gonna work?
- Because l believe it.</font>

1476
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:27,737
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You best let me out of this plane.</font>

1477
01:45:39,834 --> 01:45:41,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dropping the big boy. Sam!</font>

1478
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?</font>

1479
01:45:50,845 --> 01:45:52,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely. Let's go.</font>

1480
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:03,732
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go!</font>

1481
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:07,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.</font>

1485
01:46:26,797 --> 01:46:30,925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. Please, God! Please.</font>

1493
01:47:18,641 --> 01:47:20,266

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut this guy up, huh?</font>

1495
01:47:21,852 --> 01:47:24,270

Bumblebee, you're the decoy.</font>

1500
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,470

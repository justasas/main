1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,530
(Engine hums)

2
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,852
(Brakes squeak)

3
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,858
Hey. You.

4
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,329
Come on, l seen
that sleeping act before.

5
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,173
You know your ticket
ran out the last stop.

6
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,058
How much to San Francisco?

7
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,698
2.25.

8
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,176
(Bell tinkles)

9
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,330
Yes, three days.

10
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,096
So it's three days she's gone.

11
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,809
Where do you get off keeping it
from the police 72 hours?

12
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,858
l didn't want it to get around,
Mr Johnson, that's all.

13
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,373
People talk.

14
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,610
Stella's a good girl, really she is.

15
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,295
- l don't want them to talk.
- Well, we'll find what took her.

16
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,848
Why not give it till morning,
Johnson?

17
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,692
Stella'll show up.

18
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,532
OK. Till morning.

19
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,134
You oughta know, Mr Judd. Cood night.

20
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,936
- Cood night, Johnson.
- Cood night.

21
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,499
Way down this week, Pop.

22
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,492
Nobody plays it
when Stella not around.

23
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,332
Yeah, l guess not.

24
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,854
You don't think she might have
done something to herself?

25
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,692
Not Stella.

26
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,534
Back in New York, l handled
31 suicide cases, personally.

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,494
Everything from poison to jumping
in front of the Flatbush subway.

28
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,016
Stella's not the type.

29
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,611
- Here's your receipt.
- Thanks, Atkins.

30
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,452
l'll be seein' ya.

31
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,171
Cup of coffee, please.

32
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,491
lt's after ten, we're closed up.

33
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,094
And a hamburger: well done,
with onions, mustard, relish...

34
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,058
What else you want on that,
the whole state of California?

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,132
- What's the population?
- l'll fix you something.

36
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,373
(Sighs)

37
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,456
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

38
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,496
Never touch them.

39
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,216
(Bell tinkles)

40
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,616
l knew you'd be back.

41
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,932
OK.

42
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,018
- l'm back.
- Well, here y'are, young man.

43
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,618
Stella!

44
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,539
You...

45
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,258
You're OK.

46
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,932
l'm hungry.

47
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,170
Right away, Stella, right away.

48
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,734
You don't know what it's been like
since you went.

49
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,459
You won't go away, Stella,
will you, again?

50
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,178
Well, see you tomorrow.

51
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,978
Room's waiting for you.

52
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,370
l paid him not to touch a thing.
You wanted it like that, didn't you?

53
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,179
- (Bell tinkles)
- And you'll come back to your job,

54
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,935
everything just like it was,
'cept you'd never been away.

55
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,536
That's just how it'll be.

56
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,451
After a long rest.

57
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,852
You sure look run out.

58
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,692
So what?

59
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,654
One look at him
and l knew he wasn't any good.

60
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,300
- l knew...
- You make me sick.

61
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,016
He's finished his coffee. Co on.

62
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,415
That was the best hamburger
l never ate.

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,968
Sorry, come back later...
l mean tomorrow.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,210
- l'm closing up.
- How much?

65
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,336
- lt's OK.
- lt's not OK.

66
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,215
He got his coffee,
let him pay for it.

67
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,858
Five cents.

68
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,936
(Cash register dings)

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,976
(Coins scrape)

70
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,172
(Cash register slams shut)

71
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,016
(Cash register dings)

72
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,415
(Chirruping)

73
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,976
- Cood evening.
- Uh-huh?

74
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,290
- Professor Madley, please.
- Professor Madley?

75
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,496
He won't be here till tomorrow.

76
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,094
- Oh.
- Maybe Mr Ellis could help you.

77
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,735
- Ellis?
- The Professor's assistant.

78
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,572
He registered this morning.

79
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,618
Oh, Ellis! Oh, yes.
What's his room number?

80
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,895
216, but he's not in just now.

81
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,971
Of course, he's getting tuned.

82
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,612
- Tuned?
- To the other world.

83
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,055
He always does that
before the Professor comes in.

84
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,096
- ls that so?
- Oh, sure.

85
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,932
l'll wait for Ellis in his room.

86
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,580
- That's against the rules.
- Don't worry, it's all right.

87
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,896
(Clock chimes)

88
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,498
(Door creaks)

89
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,249
(Croans)

90
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,648
- Mr Ellis, l presume.
- Yes.

91
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,136
My name is Stanton.

92
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,650
- Eric Stanton.
- Never heard of you.

93
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,896
Professor Madley's an old friend.

94
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,936
- When was that?
- The good old days.

95
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,373
How old?

96
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,098
Old enough to be good.

97
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,738
Oh. Drink?

98
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,572
My favourite brand.

99
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,218
Oughta be, l got it
out of your bureau drawer.

100
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,811
(Laughs) Help yourself to everything

101
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,539
as long as you're a friend
of the Professor's.

102
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,500
- From my cradle days.
- Then do the Professor a favour.

103
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,411
Lend-lease him thirty dollars.

104
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,651
- Thirty dollars?
- Do him half a favour. Fifteen.

105
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,855
(Chuckles)

106
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,773
What's so funny?
Tell me, l'd like to laugh too.

107
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,816
l came up to put the bite on you.

108
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,256
Now let's hear how you laugh.

109
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,456
- You can't sleep here.
- Wait a minute.

110
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,213
Consult the spirit of my friend
the Professor. What's <i>he</i> say?

111
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,576
l know what the manager says:
one more guest, one more dollar.

112
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,616
l haven't got enough for my own bill.

113
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,453
- Then the extra dollar won't matter.
- Don't take your shoes off.

114
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,008
l've enough to aggravate me.

115
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,212
Don't worry.

116
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,973
- l'll get you out of it.
- What with? You're broke.

117
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,100
l gotta have fifteen dollars
by noon tomorrow,

118
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,455
or lose the hall downstairs
and my deposit,

119
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,451
besides being kicked out of here.

120
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,292
What about the Professor's spooks?

121
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,940
Don't they come through
with an advance sale?

122
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,976
Sure, if there's nobody to stop them,

123
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,733
but a certain woman in this town
don't believe in spooks,

124
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,175
and what she says goes
for the rest of the women.

125
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,455
She's not only the daughter
of the former mayor,

126
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,690
who donated a new organ
to the church,

127
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,975
but the President
of the Ladies' Auxiliary.

128
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,370
Against such a combination,
not even l could sell one ticket.

129
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,098
Co charm her.

130
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,729
Miss Mills will have no truck
with me, not even on the phone.

131
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,380
- Well, let's sleep on it.
- l said no.

132
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,658
We're in this thing together.
Naturally, l'll sleep here.

133
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,095
- Stands to reason.
- What stands to reason?

134
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,976
You are in trouble, man.
l've got to pull you out of it.

135
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,620
- Have you got any toothpaste?
- ln the bathroom.

136
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,176
Hope you like my brand!

137
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,612
(Birdsong)

138
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,972
Cood morning.

139
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,096
- Your mistress, please.
- Who?

140
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,932
Miss Clara Mills.

141
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,020
l'm Clara Mills, and we're not
buying anything, either.

142
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,250
l am here to speak
on the behalf of the dead.

143
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,093
Walton's respected deceased
are having a rendezvous tonight

144
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,533
at the Walton Hotel.

145
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,373
There's nothing to discuss,
l told you that on the phone.

146
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,020
- Now don't call again, Mr Ellis.
- Oh, l'm not Mr Ellis.

147
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,217
l'm not a part of the spook act
down at the hotel. l'm Eric Stanton.

148
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,291
Would you listen to me for a minute?

149
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,974
- Out with it, l'm busy.
- So is Professor Madley.

150
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,415
Appointments with the dead
from coast to coast.

151
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,058
Yet this soul of generosity

152
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,608
finds time to drop in on Walton
to deliver a message of hope.

153
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,656
For money. He's a charlatan.
A fraud.

154
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,571
Not the Professor Madley.

155
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,571
Pretending to commune with the dead.

156
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,096
Now, look... He and Ellis are just
a couple of struggling artists

157
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,092
like fortune-tellers,
or a vaudeville team.

158
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,217
l won't let the poor, gullible people
of Walton be fooled.

159
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,337
lf my father were alive, these fakers
would never have gotten a licence.

160
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,854
- Your father?
- Abraham Mills was a real mayor.

161
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,613
He wouldn't have let frauds
take advantage of honest people.

162
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,498
What if Mayor Mills would like
to make another speech,

163
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,650
or tell you something?
Suppose he's...

164
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,810
Suppose you leave right now!

165
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,856
Suppose l do.

166
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,614
But don't forget, the curtain goes up
tonight at eight o'clock.

167
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,539
Birds of a feather. Well,
they won't hatch anything here.

168
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,933
Trading on people's sacred feelings.

169
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,209
Everything that's dear held up
to ridicule by frauds in a trance,

170
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,256
rapping on a table.

171
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,299
We won't have any of the cheap,
vulgar tricks of spiritualism here.

172
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,972
You think l'm wrong?

173

l think he's right.

174
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,692
But how can he be?

175
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,340
June, don't be taken in
by his glib manner.

176
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,014
He meant it: just two people
trying to make a living.

177
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,056
Why can't they make an honest living?

178

(Chuckles) Are we to judge?

Well, it's too late now, there's
nothing we can do about it.

- What?

- How?

188
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,216
Push these tickets to your customers.

- Sure. What are they for?

A spook meeting tonight, featuring
the one and only Professor Madley.

191

- No.
- Why not?

lf the Ladies' Auxiliary
don't want 'em, l don't want 'em.

193
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,454
Don't worry about the women. They
wouldn't miss hearing Abraham Mills.

194
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,895
- Mills?
- The Professor's bringing him back.

195
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,335
- With a message.
- l don't believe in it.

196
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,809
What's the difference?
You can still make some money.

197
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,255
No, l don't wanna get mixed up
in anything.

Old friend? l don't recall.

- Sorry, l still can't remember.

- Relax, Professor. We've never met.

Last night in my room, you said...

206

- And you never met him?
- Clad to meet you now, Professor.

207

Delighted, Mr Stanton.

All the signs point to a prosperous
association. Dollar signs.

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,332

- OK, comin' up.

that you really work wonders.

Well, OK.

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,938
l never believed you could talk
Miss Mills into buying tickets.

215
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,580
l just had a call from her sister
to reserve a couple.

216
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,175
They're coming over to get a message
from their old man. Right, Professor?

217
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,252
Ah, yes, l had a visitation from him
on US Route 101 .

218
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,092
He definitely arrives tonight.

219
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,535
What do you say, Pop?
Now do you believe it?

220
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,180
He definitely arrives tonight, sir.

221
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,891
He better arrive tonight,
he's your main attraction.

Who is Mills,
and why does he want to come back?

- Wait, leave me one of these.

- Oh, gladly.

Why?

we come to our last experiment,

for which l must have your undivided
attention and sincere concentration.

coming over me.

since he departed.

- Oh, yes, very much.

You're troubled
because your daughter Clara

everything you left her.

who came here after you passed on and
talked her into selling everything.

Why didn't she ask
the police for help

- when he ran away with the money?
- Come, Clara.

344
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,009
No.

345
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,455
That's OK for kids, but not for me.

346
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,298
Not any more.

347
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,212
Where are you from?

348
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,655
What has that got to do with it?

349
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,458
OK, don't tell me.

350
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,892
l'm from New York.

351
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,616
- Now you know.
- Er...

352
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,134
What do you do
when you don't tell fortunes?

353
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,176
l help make 'em for others.

354
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,854
l passed actresses,
directors, producers,

355
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,898
through a publicity mill l ran:
they came out famous.

356
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,936
Their names in all the papers.

357
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,093
- You know people like that?
- l know all people in all places.

358
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,139
Like 21 , the Stork Club: that's where
you belong, smothered in mink.

359
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,619
l can see you there.

360
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,659
Do you see me with a ring on my
finger? Somebody to give me a home?

361
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,572
Sure. Sure.

362
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,333
Now, look...

363
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,976
last night, l made up my mind.

364
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,051
That's the way l want it.

365
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,337
He didn't see it that way,
so l walked home.

366
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,298
At night. Miles before l got a ride.

367
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,537
Was plenty tired when l got in, too.
You saw me.

368
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,494
- But when l make up my mind...
- Forget about last night.

369
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,131
You talk different, sure,

370
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,975
but you drive just like the rest.

371
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,376
Well, you got the wrong girl.

372
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,089
Yeah?

373
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,329
(Struggles)

374
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,969
No!

375
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,698
Tomorrow, you're going.

376
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,248
- Where does that leave me?
- You'll go with me.

377
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:55,539
What on? You got into town with one
dollar in your pocket. You're a fake!

378
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,251
Why, you little gyp!

379
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,049
Dealing a buck out
of the cash register, and calling...

380
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,495
Co on. Co on back
to your one-armed joint

381
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,333
and wait for somebody
to come and marry you.

382
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,657
(Church bells)

383
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,258
(Window squeaks)

384
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,218
Coming, Eric?

385
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,858
Yeah, l'm coming.

386
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,137
Professor's waiting. lt never
felt so good getting out of town.

387
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,856
Even with the bills all paid.

388
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,932
Don't smile,
your face looks better without it.

389
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,570
- See ya downstairs.
- OK.

390
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,134
Top of the mornin', my boy. Hop in.

391
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,496
- Cood morning.
- Cet in.

392
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,048
- l'm not going.
- Not going? What's wrong?

393
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,892
Nothing. You go ahead, l'll meet you.

394
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,971
We need you for advance publicity.

395
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,016
San Francisco's tough on spooks.

396
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,660
- Hit 'em like the earthquake.
- When l feel like it.

397
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,891
l made it clear when l took this job,
you can't tie me down.

398
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,572
lt cramps my style.

399
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,777
l work best when a certain feeling
comes and right now, l don't have it.

400
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,454
- Cenius.
- Eric, my boy, you're an artist.

401
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,008
- Have a bus ticket on the firm.
- Never mind that.

402
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,173
Well, you'll always find your
favourite brand in my bureau drawer.

403
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,016
(Footsteps)

404
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,100
- lt's about time you showed up.
- (Bell tinkles)

405
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,698
(Bell tinkles)

406
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,450
My bus leaves in fifteen minutes.

407
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,578
You got a nickel?

408
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,049
l... l just came back
to say l'm sorry about last night.

409
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,654
- (? Kay Kyser and his Orchestra)
- Save it.

410
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,658
- Nothing else you want to say?
- No.

411
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,133
- Don't give me that act.
- What act?

412
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,300
- You know what l mean.
- (Bell tinkles)

413
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,169
Hello.

414
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,016
So long... for good!

415
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,858
(Bell tinkles)

416
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,052
What bit him?

417
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,335
Just trying to make his bus, l guess.

418
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,899
? <i>Slowly</i>

419
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,972
? <i>You stirred in my arms</i>

420
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,175
? <i>Thrilling me so...</i> ?

421
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,009
- Well, in or out?
- Skip it.

422
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,176
(Engine hums)

423
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,819
This finishes it.
You'll never see me again.

424
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,369
Coodbye.

425
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,609
Coodbye!

426
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,609
Oh!

427
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,936
Always leave 'em laughing.

428
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,658
You again.

429
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,898
- Whaddya want?
- l wanna talk to you.

430
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,538
OK, talk.

431
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,857
Don't give me that smile.

432
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,292
OK, l don't smile.

433
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,895
l thought you had something to say!

434
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,696
- Doesn't that say it?
- l heard that kinda talk before.

435
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,133
Cood night.

436
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:57,934
l never said it before. To anybody.

437
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,169
Ever.

438
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,368
l'll marry you, Stella,
if that's what you want.

439
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,576
You? You don't kid me.

440
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,218
l'm not kidding.

441
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,655
- Last night, you...
- Last night, l didn't know you.

442
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,012
What made you tick.

443
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,413
l know you now. l know why l couldn't
pull out of here this morning,

444
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,252
or get on that bus.

445
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,689
l can't get away without you,
and l'm not going without you.

446
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,169
- What's in it for me?
- You said you wanted that:

447
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,613
a ring on your finger.

448
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,658
That isn't enough. What goes with it?
l want a home.

449
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,298
l'll get it for you.

450
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,450
What with, one dollar in your pocket?

451
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,816
Twelve and a half thousand dollars.

452
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,530
Where would you get
twelve and a half thousand dollars?

453
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,010
What's the difference,
as long as l get it?

454
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,897
How? You gonna murder somebody?

455
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,379
- Talk sense.
- Steal it?

456
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,212
- Listen.
- Well, l don't know you!

457
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,258
You know one thing.
We're gonna get married.

458
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,498
Once l get the cash.

459
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:57,736
Maybe you'll get me in trouble.
l don't wanna get in trouble.

460
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,129
You won't, not the way l'll get it.

461
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,016
l'm not even telling you how.

462
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,295
You just sit tight and wait for me.

463
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,938
That's the deal.

464
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,452
You'll keep it.

465
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,212
Maybe l will.

466
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,140
(Strains of church organ from within)

467
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,457
(Church organ grows louder)

468
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,852
A very good performance, Miss Mills.
Please, go on.

469
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,976
Beethoven never sounded so good.

470
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,009
- l wasn't playing Beethoven.
- No?

471
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,217
Why, sure, it was Brahms. The old
boys do sound alike, don't they?

472
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,858
l mean, in spots.

473
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,932
- What spots?
- The way they begin and end,

474
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,375
sometimes in the middle,
like the piece you were playing.

475
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,894
lt wasn't anything,
l was just improvising.

476
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,540
lf Brahms didn't write that,
you wrote him one better.

477
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,612
That was beautiful.
lt was classical, it was inspiring.

478
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,649
You know,
you belong in Carnegie Hall.

479
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,131
Now, look, you can't stay angry
at me forever, not two full days.

480
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,815
Wait a minute. What about
living up to the place we're in?

481
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,176
And the music you play here?

482
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,651
So when a guy says he's sorry,
the least you can do is forgive him.

483
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,458
All right, l forgive you.

484
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,449
- Friends?
- l hardly know you.

485
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,896
(Chuckles) Don't worry about that,
we'll fix it right away.

486
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,938
lt's a good thing word didn't come
through from New York this morning.

487
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,738
l get the chance to stay another day,

488
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,175
square things
with you and your sister.

489
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,219
Tell me, what is there to do in this
town to make time pass till tomorrow?

490
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,860
- That's up to you, isn't it?
- What do you do?

491
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,374
Oh, there's plenty
to occupy your time here.

492
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,009
The movies, dancing,
the beach isn't far.

493
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,492
They'll tell you at the hotel.

494
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,175
You still think l tried to hurt your
sister. l didn't mean to, really.

495
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,296
l only meant to help the Professor.

496
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,134
That's happened before. l try to help
somebody, somebody else gets hurt.

497
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,017
That's the way it's been all my life.

498
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,534
Of course. You live by impulse.

499
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,932
You never bother to think if you're
following the right or wrong impulse.

500
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,375
l see you don't stop at music,
you read too.

501
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,813
Don't you?

502
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,858
l haven't opened a book
since l left school. They're phoney.

503
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,613
- So are some people.
- At least they're alive.

504
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,737
- So are books.
- You come to a part you don't like,

505
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,175
you can turn the page,
but try it on people.

506
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,852
Try it on life.

507
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,535
l'll tell you something about
yourself. You're scared to live.

508
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,812
That's why you bury yourself
in books and music.

509
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,858
l think you ought to respect my ways
as l respect yours.

510
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,692
Only l live and you don't.

511
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,738
All the things you look down on
are the things that make up life.

512
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,969
What things?

513
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,733
Little things. A game of bowling,
or a swim at night...

514
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,969
(Bell)

515
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,538
Or a dance.

516
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,374
A kiss. Stuff with bubbles.

517
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,857
l bet you never had a drink.

518
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,659
- That doesn't mean anything.
- Not by itself, it doesn't.

519
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,494
But you add up all the little things,
that's what makes up life.

520
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,935
Maybe you're the one
that's scared, not l.

521
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,373
How come?

522
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,099
You don't know what you want,
that's why you're scared.

523
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,740
That's why you keep running
after every little thing.

524
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,414
That's quite a mind you have there,
Miss Mills.

525
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,850
You mean for a girl in a small town?

526
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,898
Must be the books, huh?

527
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,333
Must be.

528
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,937
lf you didn't know me so well,
l might ask you something.

529
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,329
- You'd probably say no, though.
- Probably.

530
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,376
So there's really no use in asking.

531
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,496
Well, why don't you ask me anyway?

532
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,976
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

533
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,416
Well, l, l don't think l can.

534
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,774
You see?

535
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,215
You're afraid to step out
of your tower.

536
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,938
No, no, no, that isn't it.

537
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,373
Your sister?

538
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,849
- Of course not.
- Then what are you afraid of?

539
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,931
l'm not afraid. Why should l be?

540
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,773
Yeah, why should you be?
l'll pick you up at seven.

541
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,418
At seven.

542
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,018
Two, please.

543
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,056
Don't you ever see anything through?

544
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,653
When it's worth it.

545
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,289
We've had a dinner you didn't like
and saw a movie you didn't like.

546
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,416
- What's next?
- Dancing?

547
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,492
All right. Let's not miss any of the
things that make up your happy life.

548
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,018
(Chattering, music)

549
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,330
Well, here's to your first Scotch.

550
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,053
(Clinking)

551
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,058
How do you like it?

552
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,452
lt tastes like soap.

553
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,775
lf this is what all
your little things add up to, l...

554
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,213
l don't think it's very much.

555
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,860
Did you learn to play Beethoven
in one night? No.

556
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,090
Then don't expect
to learn this in one night.

557
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,136
l don't think you enjoy it either.

558
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:46,815
- Because you don't.
- But l want to, that's why l came.

559
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,851
Frankly, why did you ask me?

560
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,613
No special reason.
You happen to interest me.

561
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,893
ln what way?

562
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,619
l can't define it.
Maybe it's your charm.

563
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,899
Maybe it's your talent.
Ever think of a career?

564
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,852
- Maybe?
- And?

565
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,408
No. No, l know my limitations.

566
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,934
One shouldn't set a limit
on what one can do.

567
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,416
Mr Stanton, that sounds
as if it came out of a book.

568
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,172
And not a very good one!

569
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,296
There goes that mind again.

570
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,336
Shall we turn the page and dance?

571
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,376
Oh, it's been an awfully long time.

572
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,018
l'll lead you.

573
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,056
(? Dance-hall music)

574
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,978
You're doing fine.

575
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,489
Thank you.

576
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,136
(Music stops, applause)

577
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,896
(Whispers) Hey, ditch him
and l'll meet you afterward.

578
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,130
(Whispers) l don't cheat on a date.

579
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,696
(Music starts up again)

580
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,218
(Chirruping)

581
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,571
There's still one more little thing.

582
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,449
Don't worry, l'm not going
to kiss you goodnight

583
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,292
and make you unhappy.

584
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,733
Unhappy?

585
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,776
Don't you take too much for granted?

586
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,215
No. One kiss
goes a long way with you.

587
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,734
You need a guy who will take it
the same way,

588
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,618
who will give you a marriage with
all the trimmings, home and kids.

589
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:31,498
Who'll walk to church with you
every Sunday and listen to you play.

590
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,536
Save all your ''Cood nights'' for him.

591
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,380
What makes you think
l wanted you to kiss me?

592
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,813
Didn't you?

593
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,013
(Door slams)

594
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,418
(Bell tinkles)

595
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,652
(Cash register dings)

596
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,100
- Short of help this morning, huh?
- Kinda.

597
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,020
- She always come in this late?
- Sometimes.

598
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,536
Why d'you want to know?

599
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,658
Just thought maybe
she'd skipped out on you again.

600
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,334
No, she won't do it.
She promised me she won't.

601
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,775
- (Bell tinkles)
- Stella!

602
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,612
Mornin', Stella.

603
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,850
(Sighs) Cood mornin'.

604
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,770
Whew! Sure could use some coffee.

605
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,376
l got something special for you.

606
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,176
l waited for you last night.

607
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,012
Until after three.

608
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,853
That's nice.

609
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,692
Where were you?

610
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,933
Around.

611
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,856
- With that guy?
- Oh, leave me alone, it's too early.

612
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,618
Here y'are.

613
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,449
- Mm, thanks.
- Where d'you get the watch?

614
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,098
You like it?

615
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,380
Cet me some hash. Cood and brown.

616
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,418
l said some hash.

617
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,292
You get this last night?

618
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,575
Wait till we're married, then ask me.

619
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,128
Till then,
l don't have to tell you a thing.

620
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,176
We're as good as married.

621
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,409
(Chuckles)

622
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,376
You're dropping out of circulation.

623
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,418
From now on, when you go out,
it'll only be with me.

624
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,018
You've got a steady date,
with Miss Mills.

625
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,056
l'm only doing that for you.

626
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,369
- Lot of good l'm getting out of it.
- You will in a couple of days.

627
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,020
OK, couple of days,
but that don't mean forever.

628
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,658
(Bell tinkles)

629
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,772
Morning, Mr Judd.

630
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,412
Cood morning, Stella.

631
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,173
(Bell tinkles)

632
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,689
Hello.

633
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,812
With my compliments.

634
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,731
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

635
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,573
l'm leaving tomorrow
and l wanted to say goodbye.

636
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,412
Coodbye, Mr Stanton.

637
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,892
We're going to pick up a few things.
Can we take you anywhere?

638
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,732
Anywhere you say.

639
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,939
- Can three of us get in there?
- l think so. You go ahead.

640
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,373
Thank you.

641
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,452
(Engine starts, revving)

642
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,450
Nice town. Hate to leave it.

643
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,289
- Expect to go far?
- Maybe.

644
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,612
Maybe l'll be back.

645
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,092
And maybe l won't.

646
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,733
lt depends.

647
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,573
On what?

648
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,651
On what there is to come back to.

649
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,211
l... l'll be just a minute.

650
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,891
What would you come back for?

651
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,729
June.

652
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,175
l gathered as much.
Let's be frank, shall we?

653
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,410
My cards are on the table,
Miss Mills.

654
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,252
l want you to leave June alone.

655
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,059
We don't know who you are
or where you come from.

656
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,290
- What do you do?
- Nothing.

657
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,538
That's frank, at least.

658
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,771
l'm sure you'll be interested to know
l have no bank account, either.

659
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,418
l thought so.

660
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,456
Your hand is showing, Miss Mills.

661
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,258
You've got a trump card: money.

662
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,810
- And because l haven't any, you...
- lt has nothing to do with money.

663
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,573
June has quite enough,
even without my share.

664
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,013
Your share?

665
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,809
Yes, she'll get that too. l want her
to be happy, that's all l care about.

666
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,011
lt's all hers, whatever l have.

667
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:37,094
ln San Francisco, Mr Stanton,
where no-one can touch it.

668
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,010
Not until she meets the right man.

669
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,974
Well, maybe l'm not
the right man after all.

670
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,856
And you won't see her again?

671
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,820
Suppose we leave that up
to the one concerned.

672
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,293
(Engine starts)

673
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,536
- There you are.
- Thank you.

674
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,656
Wonderful. Just wonderful.

675
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,015
lf l've accomplished nothing else,

676
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,217
at least l've made you like
one of the little things l like.

677
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,656
l have my little secrets, too.

678
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,136
Bet you think all l do is read
big, heavy books, don't you?

679
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,778
But l don't.

680
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,499
For years, l've been saving
ads out of magazines.

681
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,738
Sometimes, l...

682
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,290
l feel like l'm the girl in the ads,

683
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,049
softly alluring, full of grace,

684
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,298
gowned by Schiaparelli.

685
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,735
lf l had money,
l'd dress you like the ads.

686
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,380
Take you to New York,
at least to San Francisco.

687
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,496
You'd have that Schiaparelli gown.

688
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,652
lt isn't that important.

689
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,891
lt would be when l took you
to the nightclubs, the theatre.

690
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:54,211
The concerts. D'you ever hear
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra?

691
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,733
Mm-hm. On the radio.

692
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,493
Whaddya hear on the radio?
A lot of noise.

693
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,650
But when you see 'em up on the stage,

694
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,459
all dressed up with their fiddles
and their horns,

695
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,533
ten thousand people waiting for
the music to begin. That's a concert.

696
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,976
Particularly when Toscanini conducts,
as he is tomorrow afternoon.

697
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,618
Toscanini?

698
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,849
Yeah.

699
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,489
And you know what? After the concert,
l'll get him to listen to you play,

700
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,935
see who's right about your talent,
you or me.

701
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:23,376
- You know Arturo Toscanini?
- l'll make it my business to.

702
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:27,419
We can leave for San Francisco in the
morning, make it in plenty of time.

703
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,649
No.

704
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,733
Your sister?

705
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,969
Yes.

706
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,290
You gotta do everything she says?

707
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,018
No, but l...

708
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,058
Well, l guess after tonight,
it's goodbye.

709
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,172
l guess it is.

710
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,453
Anyway, there are a few things
to remember.

711
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,056
lt could've been wonderful.

712
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,458
(Softly) Mm-hm.

713
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,214
lf l were another guy, the right guy,

714
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,460
it could've gone on like this,
night after night.

715
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,292
Just the two of us.

716
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,974
A fire, hot dogs, wine.

717
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,773
Martinis.

718
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,177
Wonderful martinis.

719
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,377
Coulda been a dream.

720
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,819
- A beautiful dream.
- You and l together.

721
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,856
New York and San Francisco.

722
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,249
Mm-hm.

723
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,695
Cetting you all those things
in the ads.

724
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,898
Coing everywhere together,

725
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,972
to the concerts,
to hear the famous people play.

726
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,096
Becoming famous yourself.

727
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,132
Creat career.

728
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,537
''Miss June Mills,
the finest talent of them all.''

729
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,976
''Woman Of The Year.''

730
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,373
(Chirruping)

731
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,173
(Knocking)

732
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,812
(Knocks louder)

733
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,858
- (Stella) Who is it?
- Eric. l have to see you right away.

734
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,532
(Stella) lt can wait till tomorrow.

735
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,178
lt's important.

736
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,932
(Stella) OK, l'm listening.

737
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:41,658
l can't talk to you like this.

738
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,492
(Stella) l can hear you.

739
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,491
Open up, what are you afraid of?

740
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,935
- Oh, pipe down, will ya?!
- (Window slides shut)

741
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,134
You wanna wake everybody up?
Whaddya want?

742
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,090
l came to tell you l can't
go through with it like l planned.

743
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,932
lt'll take too long.

744
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,136
l knew it. You didn't stand a chance.

745
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,858
That isn't it.

746
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,410
Look, you know how l feel about you.

747
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,060
You've gotta believe in me,
have confidence in me.

748
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,176
l want you. l'm nuts about you.

749
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,898
That wasn't the deal.

750
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,450
Well, what of it? l'll get you that
home and everything you wanted.

751
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,930
l can do it. l've got ideas
that work and pay off big.

752
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,580
Come on,
let's get out of here, tonight.

753
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,252
l'm taking no chances.

754
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,298
- Now listen to me, Stella...
- l stick to a deal.

755
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,536
Satisfied there's nobody here?

756
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:33,618
Now beat it.

757
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,134
(Ringing)

758
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,052
- Yeah?
- 'Eric?'

759
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,569
Yeah.

760
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:00,413
'l'm so glad. l was afraid
you might have already left.'

761
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,456
- Who is this?
- June.

762
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,818
Eric, l'm going with you.

763
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:07,693
To San Francisco?

764
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,409
To the concert, on the nine o'clock
train. We'll pick you up.

765
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,775
We?

766
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:14,737
Yes, Clara's going along too.

767
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,210
She had to go to San Francisco anyway
to take care of some business,

768
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,575
and thought she might as well
do it a week early.

769
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,059
'Clad to have her along.'

770
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,335
Thank you, Eric. We'll be right over.

771
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,658
(Traffic roars)

772
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,015
- Wanna wait here?
- No, l'll go in with you.

773
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,216
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

774
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,497
Mills, number seventeen.

775
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,095
Yes, Miss Mills. Clara and June
Mills. Joint ownership.

776
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,932
Either one of you sign here.

777
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,692
What's the rent on a box?

778
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,692
Four dollars a month,
but there's none available now.

779
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,975
We might have some vacancies
next month.

780
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,416
- l need one now.
- Put whatever you want in our box.

781
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,377
l might need it when you're home.

782
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,098
Come on, June.

783
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:37,456
Have you a telephone directory?

784
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,532
Yes, right around the corner.

785
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,372
- This way?
- Yes.

786
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,654
Thanks.

787
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:59,496
(Dialling)

788
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,894
- The gentleman went to the phone.
- Thank you.

789
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,489
- Creat luck, l found him in.
- Who?

790
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:26,378
Somebody very important. Might have
a great effect on your career.

791
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,496
- Who is he?
- Wait till you meet him.

792
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,730
l told him we'd be over right away.

793
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,895
Co ahead.
l want to make a call from here.

794
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,938
- l'll meet you after the concert.
- We wouldn't think of it.

795
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,693
- Eric asked you to go with us.
- Sure, you're going.

796
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,852
Meet us at two-thirty sharp
in front of the auditorium.

797
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,293
Two-thirty.

798
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,940
- Cood luck.
- Thanks, we'll need it.

799
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,416
(Traffic)

800
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,732
(Car horns)

801
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,535
There is no concert.
l suppose you know that.

802
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,896
- He knew it all along.
- Cetting us up here, pretending...

803
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,936
- He had to.
- Why?

804
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,409
Any better way of getting June
out of Walton?

805
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,855
- There, we didn't have a chance.
- What chance?

806
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,896
- To get married.
- Married?

807
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,216
Sure. Here's the evidence.

808
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,860
''Certificate Of Marriage.''

809
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,293
June...

810
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:35,171
you don't know what you've done!

811
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,613
l do.

812
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,816
l'll have the whole thing annulled.

813
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,255
No, you won't, Clara.
l know what l want.

814
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,900
This isn't as sudden as you think.

815
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,252
Well, what's the verdict?

816
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,972
l hope you'll be very happy.

817
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:52,209
Thank you.

818
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:55,849
l suppose the next thing to say
is ''Shall we be friends?''

819
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,095
We could be, if you make June happy.

820
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,050
Sure l will. Right from the start.

821
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,012
What are your plans?

822
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,456
Well, l'd like to go home first
and get a few things together.

823
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,293
Then we'll go some place
for a little while, right, Eric?

824
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,733
OK, back to Walton.

825
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,697
First, l'd like to try another bank.

826
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,135
l wanna put this
in a safe deposit box.

827
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,576
Don't wanna take any chances carrying
it around. l've a few valuables too.

828
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,299
- Why don't you put it in our box?
- lt's in your name.

829
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,292
l'll put it away for you.

830
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,055
l always thought of it that way,
didn't l, June?

831
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,289
Yes, dear.

832
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,339
l said to myself ''When June gets
married, this will be her home.''

833
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:43,539
''l'll give it to her and her husband
to do with as they please.''

834
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,532
lf l am to stay on,
it'll be as a guest.

835
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,776
A guest in June's home.

836
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,455
Assuming, of course, that l'm wanted.

837
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,532
- Of course we want you with us.
- Absolutely. Here, have some more.

838
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:56,769
No.

839
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,335
lt's time for a guest
to say good night.

840
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,213
Cood night.

841
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,938
Cood night, Clara.

842
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,092
l'll be up in a minute.

843
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,010
- (? Kay Kyser and his Orchestra)
- ? <i>ls that the smile?</i>

844
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,378
(Car revs)

845
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,373
? <i>Slowly</i>

846
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,451
Won't you even have a drink with me?

847
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,218
l got a date.

848
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:16,098
- ? <i>Smiling above</i>
- Can l walk you home?

849
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:17,932
l said l got a date.

850
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,376
- ? <i>That's when</i>
- Cood night, Stella.

851
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:22,530
Don't forget to lock the door.

852
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,651
- (Bell tinkles)
- ? <i>l was in love</i> ?

853
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,856
- Stella?
- Yeah?

854
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,295
You're going to San Francisco
tomorrow.

855
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,973
Am l?

856
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:40,259
Tomorrow, l'll have that money.
All of it.

857
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,696
- Meet me up there and then...
- How do l know you'll have it?

858
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,135
l'm going to San Francisco
with her to get it.

859
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,609
Well, l won't. And she won't either.

860
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,575
Oh, yes, she will.
lt's her honeymoon.

861
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:56,370
- Her what?
- Yeah.

862
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:59,089
l married her... this afternoon.

863
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,252
lt was the only way.

864
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,296
Congratulations(!)

865
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:07,813
Now, listen,
we're really not married.

866
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,210
- (Music stops)
- We'll be divorced in no time.

867
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,655
l haven't even kissed her.
ln fact, l can have it annulled.

868
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:14,776
- (Sighs) Cood night!
- (Bell tinkles)

869
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,612
Now wait a minute!

870
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,453
What do you want?
<i>She's</i> your wife, not me.

871
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,292
l don't run around with married men.

872
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:24,133
l did it for you,
to get you what you wanted.

873
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,972
Now keep your part of the deal.

874
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,494
Oh, sure, but she's got
the ring on her finger.

875
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,332
She's not so dumb.

876
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,819
- Well, l'm not a dope, either!
- (Engine starts)

877
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,973
Sugar? Cream?

878
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,209
No.

879
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,738
Co ahead, say it.

880
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,896
l have nothing to say, Eric.

881
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,372
l'm waiting for you.

882
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,458
Well, l'm sorry.

883
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,695
Maybe l shouldn't
have stayed out that late.

884
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,015
All of sudden, there l was,
a married man.

885
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,212
l had to go out for a drink.

886
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,535
By the time l got back in,
you were asleep.

887
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,656
Why did you go to that girl
in the diner?

888
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,174
- What girl?
- Clara saw you.

889
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,936
- You mean she went out after me?
- Yes, she told me this morning.

890
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,375
Well, that's fine. Clara told you.

891
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,899
What's she gonna do? Follow me around
everywhere l go? Check up on me?

892
00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,939
She's been running your life up to
now, and she better stay out of mine.

893
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,251
l was angry with her too, at first,
but she means well.

894
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,296
Yeah? Then why did she tell you?

895
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,576
So you could have a good time
worrying?

896
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,292
l didn't worry.

897
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,288
Until that...
that man came to see you.

898
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,738
What man?

899
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,656
He's with the police.

900
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,816
Wants to ask you something.

901
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,492
Ask me what?

902
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,098
About that girl.

903
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,136
She was found murdered.

904
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:33,493
Stella?

905
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,976
Yes. Yes, that was her name.

906
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,929
Eric...

907
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:43,212
what did she mean to you?

908
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,012
Does Mr Judd know?

909
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,249
Judd?

910
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:52,976
He's downstairs waiting.

911
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,930
- Mr Judd.
- Congratulations, Mr Stanton.

912
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:09,578
l just heard you were married.

913
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,015
- My best wishes to you, Mrs Stanton.
- Thank you.

914
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,898
Well, our church organist
certainly surprised us all.

915
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:17,574
Married in San Francisco
and not in the church.

916
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,696
lt certainly saves time, doesn't it?

917
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,489
Cives one the chance to get back the
same night for a nice family dinner.

918
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,219
- And after that, where d'you go?
- We retired.

919
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,449
Everybody?

920
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,292
l locked the door myself.

921
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,018
Mm-hm.

922
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:34,251
Well, l'll check up on a few things.

923
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,570
- Ah, mind if l go with you?
- Not a bit.

924
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,013
Thank you.

925
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,611
How did it happen? Who did it?

926
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,053
l don't know yet.

927
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:54,098
The Chief of Police called me this
morning and asked me to help.

928
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,375
He appointed me Special lnvestigator.

929
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,894
- You know, it's strange.
- What is?

930
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,218
That a man doesn't spend
his wedding night at home.

931
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,689
- Did Clara tell you?
- No, she didn't say anything.

932
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,498
l saw you around myself.

933
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:14,218
(Engine starts)

934
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,770
Out the way, folks. One side, please.

935
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:21,538
Hi, Mr Judd.

936
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,176
One side, please, one side.

937
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,572
Outta the way.

938
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,536
- Hello, Mr Judd.
- Johnson.

939
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,059
Hello, Pop.

940
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,692
You can sit down now.

941
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,531
- Thanks for coming, Mr Judd.
- Chief.

942
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:19,976
Coroner was here. He'll send in
his report as soon as possible.

943
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,335
ln the meantime, however,...

944
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,172
here's what he said.

945
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,616
''She was killed by a blow

946
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,452
on the left temple.''

947
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,850
''Weapon undetermined.''

948
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,931
''Probably a lead pipe.''

949
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,330
''Time of death
between three and four a.m.''

950
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:42,095
- Find the weapon?
- lt's not in here.

951
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,133
Who's she?

952
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,176
She lives downstairs, Mr Judd.

953
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,013
Says someone ran out of here
late last night.

954
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,612
She found the girl's watch
under the step this morning.

955
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,212
Cuess he must've dropped it.

956
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,258
What did he look like?

957
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,889
Oh, l don't know, mister.
lt was so dark, l couldn't see him.

958
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,450
Just as l went to close the window,
l saw him running down the street.

959
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:19,576
How d'you know it was a man you saw?

960
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,651
- l didn't say it was.
- Then it was a woman?

961
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,696
- No!
- Then it had to be a man.

962
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,248
l guess it was.
A man always took her home.

963
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,296
- Who?
- l don't know.

964
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,252
l saw <i>him</i> come up.

965
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,372
And once, l saw him.

966
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,736
Which one did you see last night?

967
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:44,659
Oh, l can't say
if it was them, honest!

968
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:48,778
Can l go now, mister?
l should be down in the store.

969
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:50,209
Please?!

970
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,291
l don't like to stay in here.

971
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,733
You can go.

972
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:02,492
So can you, Pop.

973
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:05,132
l don't need you right now.

974
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:07,292
Let me stay, Mr Judd.

975
01:02:07,820 --> 01:02:10,380
- lt's her room.
- lt <i>was</i> her room, Pop.

976
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,979
She was a good girl, wasn't she,
Mr Judd? She never meant bad.

977
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:17,412
Everybody liked her.

978
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:19,610
Yes. Everybody.

979
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,816
- Your name?
- Atkins.

980
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,856
l gave my statement to the Chief.

981
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,500
- What do you do?
- You know me, l operate jukeboxes...

982
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,538
- And slot machines.
- Only in Nevada, where it's legal.

983
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:36,853
Now, look, l already said
what l had to to the Chief.

984
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,295
l'm not answering any more questions.

985
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:42,300
What makes you think
l'm gonna question you?

986
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,132
l know how cops work.

987
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,256
How do they work, Mr Atkins?

988
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,490
Well, you're supposed to show me.

989
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,336
Perhaps we'd better go in there.

990
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,775
- lf you don't mind.
- No, l don't mind.

991
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,376
Here's his statement, Mr Judd.

992
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,018
Check his alibi.

993
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,058
- There's a phone in the store below.
- Right away.

994
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,133
Sit down.

995
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,249
Now,...
let's get down to facts, Mr Atkins.

996
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,217
You've got my alibi right there.

997
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:35,054
Don't believe me? Why don't you
wait till the Chief gets back?

998
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:37,495
l'm not interested in your alibi.

999
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,140
l'd like to know
when you gave her this watch.

1000
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:41,369
When?

1001
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,016
Why don't you ask <i>if</i> l gave it her?

1002
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:46,250
- l know you did.
- You don't.

1003
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,329
l told you l know how cops work.

1004
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,412
l don't believe you know how l work,
Mr Atkins.

1005
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,450
- Those kid gloves?
- Certainly.

1006
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,014
l don't like to mess up
any case l'm on.

1007
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,932
You gave her the watch, didn't you?

1008
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:10,453
- No.
- You did.

1009
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:12,178
- No.
- You gave her the watch.

1010
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,730
- (Judd) You gave her the watch.
- (Atkins) No.

1011
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:17,890
- You did. You gave her the watch.
- (Smacking)

1012
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:19,936
- (Atkins) No.
- (Smacking)

1013
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,817
(Smacking, Atkins groans)

1014
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,895
- You gave her the watch.
- (Atkins groans)

1015
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:41,652
All right, let's pick it up.

1016
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:43,936
What about you and Stella?

1017
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,615
Well, l've known her for a long time.

1018
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,052
l used to board at her mother's home
down San Diego.

1019
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:58,731
l... didn't have any money then,
so l couldn't marry her.

1020
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,572
Skip the romance.

1021
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:03,095
Last night, you picked her up
at 10.1 5.

1022
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,819
You were with her until two.
What happened in between?

1023
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:07,892
(Atkins) We had dinner...

1024
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:10,976
We drove down to the beach.

1025
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,336
(Judd) You got there, didn't you?

1026
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:17,413
(Atkins) Yeah, yeah.
She said she'd marry me.

1027
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,298
(Judd) Then you brought her home,
came up to kiss the bride.

1028
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:22,655
No, l didn't. l left right away.

1029
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,980
(Atkins) You see,
when Stella was murdered,

1030
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:31,815
l was in a motor court just outside
of Clenolden. That's 100 miles away.

1031
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,255
How do you know what time
Stella was murdered?

1032
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:36,058
The coroner's report.

1033
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,096
lt says around four.

1034
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:42,215
Oh, you know
l couldn't have murdered her.

1035
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,653
Sit down.

1036
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,336
- You gave her the watch, didn't you?
- No.

1037
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:53,012
Time l went home.

1038
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,689
(Judd) Just for the record,
so we can clear that up.

1039
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,170
Doesn't make you any more guilty
if you did give it to her.

1040
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:04,892
You quarrelled, you took it back,
then you lost it on the way down.

1041
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,936
No, l never gave her any jewellery.

1042
01:06:07,020 --> 01:06:09,375
- Come on, Mr Atkins, admit it.
- No.

1043
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:11,610
- Admit you were generous, just once.
- No!

1044
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,418
- Admit it.
- No!

1045
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,456
(Smacking, Atkins groans)

1046
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,412
(Shuffle, thud)

1047
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:23,577
- Mr Stanton.
- Look, you don't try that on me.

1048
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:25,972
l wouldn't think of it.

1049
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,210
l just happen not to like his face.

1050
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:31,179
Mr Judd, his alibi's OK.

1051
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:35,933
The Liddell Motor Court in Clenolden
said he checked in at 2.30.

1052
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,330
All right, Mr Atkins, you may go now.

1053
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,616
l knew his alibi'd hold up.

1054
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,292
You got the watch?

1055
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,535
l didn't say you could go,
Mr Stanton.

1056
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,689
- Sit down.
- You can't ask me anything

1057
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,532
or hold me without charges.

1058
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,375
You seem to be an expert
on loopholes.

1059
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,815
Perhaps you could tell us
who might've murdered the girl.

1060
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,652
Could've been anybody. Atkins, maybe.

1061
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,890
- lt isn't Atkins.
- Pop? He was stuck on her.

1062
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,333
Perhaps.

1063
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:12,173
- Or was it a woman? Clara Mills?
- Or the woman downstairs.

1064
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,296
- Or you, Mr Stanton?
- Or you, Mr Judd?

1065
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,972
A splendid deduction.

1066
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:19,211
The possibilities are many, and all
quite interesting, don't you think?

1067
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,256
ln a cold-blooded sort of way, sure.

1068
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,695
- You still aren't helping us.
- lt's your case.

1069
01:07:23,780 --> 01:07:26,248
But you're involved in it,
more than you realise.

1070
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,296
- Now, look...
- l'm looking.

1071
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,575
The facts, they're all against you.

1072
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:34,608
You came into town
for no obvious reasons.

1073
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:37,370
Of course, you weren't
going elsewhere.

1074
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,413
Meet a young lady,
spend some time with her,

1075
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,218
then you come up here.

1076
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,291
The woman downstairs saw you.

1077
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,413
Then you meet another young lady
and marry her.

1078
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,459
On your wedding night, you walk the
streets looking for lady number one.

1079
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:53,975
How do we know you didn't wait
for her until...

1080
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,618
l didn't.

1081
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,370
You're an expert, Mr Stanton.

1082
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:02,055
You know the exact value
of a man's word against facts.

1083
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,449
- Are you accusing me?
- Not yet.

1084
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,736
Perhaps after we find the weapon.

1085
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:11,179
However, l wouldn't plan on any
out-of-town honeymoon just yet.

1086
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,491
We might need you any moment.

1087
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,653
Cood day.

1088
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,337
What are you packing for?

1089
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:27,378
- You're not going away now, are you?
- Yes, l am.

1090
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,897
June, l won't let you go with him,
not after that girl was murdered.

1091
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,369
- l'm going, Clara.
- How can you?

1092
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,099
Why throw yourself away on someone
who's not worth it?

1093
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,772
He <i>isn't</i> worth it.

1094
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:41,250
lt's no use, there's no happiness
in it. l've been through this.

1095
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:44,218
lt's not the same thing, Clara,
please try to understand.

1096
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,858
l do understand.

1097
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:48,855
Once l believed in someone, too.

1098
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,500
No matter what people said,
l believed in him.

1099
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,016
You don't know what he meant to me.

1100
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,729
What all of his lies and broken
promises and dishonesty did to me.

1101
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,976
l can't let you ruin your life too.

1102
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,212
June, he went out after another woman
the night of your marriage!

1103
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,860
Maybe you're right,
but l can't let it end now.

1104
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:09,374
l must give us every chance.
l hardly know him yet.

1105
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:12,577
We've said so little,
we're practically strangers.

1106
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:15,618
- Together, maybe he'll change.
- He won't change.

1107
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,173
Maybe not,

1108
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:20,411
but at least l'll have tried,
done everything l could.

1109
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,013
(Door opens outside)

1110
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,852
Coodbye, Clara.

1111
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,136
- There's a train in a half-hour...
- Forget about the honeymoon.

1112
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,780
l'm beating it alone.
l'll make better time.

1113
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,418
You're running away?

1114
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,856
What do you want me to do?
Stick around here? Cet framed?

1115
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,091
And my face punched in.
You bet l'm running away.

1116
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:52,250
Won't it look bad if they want you?

1117
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:54,171
That's for Mr Judd to figure out.

1118
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:56,979
lf he wants to pin it on me,
he'll have to find me first.

1119
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,058
Where will you go?

1120
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,096
What do you want to know for?

1121
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,932
Cos l wanna go with you.

1122
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,855
You'll need me to get the money
in San Francisco.

1123
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,692
Who asked you for money?

1124
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,338
You'll need it.

1125
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,610
You mean you're giving me the money?

1126
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,694
No. No, l'm not giving it to you,
it belongs to both of us.

1127
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:20,217
All right, but when this thing
blows over, l'll pay it back to you.

1128
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,417
- Very well. l'll get the car.
- No. And we can't take the train.

1129
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,458
Or the bus, either.
Judd'll have them all watched.

1130
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,494
We've gotta get on the highway
without being seen.

1131
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,935
We'll hitchhike to San Francisco.
And no luggage.

1132
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,376
lt's gotta look as if we were
just out taking a walk. Come on.

1133
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,173
(Train)

1134
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,858
Cood evening.

1135
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:04,056
- ln and out, out and in.
- l'm sorry.

1136
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:08,418
One room right after the other. Can't
even wait till the room's ready.

1137
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:10,932
l never saw such a rush.

1138
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,976
Everybody getting married.

1139
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,178
What a dump!

1140
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,412
lt isn't so bad.

1141
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,729
Tired?

1142
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,772
Maybe l am.

1143
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,816
Waiting for something to happen.

1144
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:34,816
Nothing's going to happen.

1145
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,252
(Tap screeches)

1146
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,412
Shut it off, will you?

1147
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:25,970
l thought you might like a drink.

1148
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,450
l sure would... but not that.

1149
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,773
There's a bar downstairs
and we have a little money left.

1150
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:34,454
Whaddya want me to do,
walk right into his arms?

1151
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:37,737
- He probably isn't after you at all.
- Not much!

1152
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,738
He must've sent a description of me
to all the papers.

1153
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,697
Maybe we missed an edition.

1154
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:51,295
Couldn't be in the papers, it's too
early. There's no need to be afraid.

1155
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:53,371
Sure! Murder rap's nothing(!)

1156
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,135
Let's just go home,
so he can pin it on me.

1157
01:12:56,220 --> 01:12:59,974
- l didn't say we oughta go home.
- You didn't, but you meant it.

1158
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:01,652
The room's not good enough!

1159
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,777
Why don't you go and tell me,
you're sorry you ever came?

1160
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:07,256
But l'm not sorry, l wanted to.

1161
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:10,173
Why? So you could drive me nuts
with that quiet way of yours?

1162
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,330
- Eric...
- Why'd l bring you anyway?

1163
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:14,012
l don't need your dough.

1164
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:16,489
Wouldn't have to hang around
this dump.

1165
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,048
lf l'd been alone,
l could've kept on going.

1166
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:21,172
Maybe l will.

1167
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,050
(Faint dance-hall music)

1168
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:41,336
(Music grows louder)

1169
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,212
Double Scotch, thanks.

1170
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,291
Better make it a single.

1171
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:48,531
- l'll settle for a beer.
- Better make up your mind, mister.

1172
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:50,696
lt is made up. A beer.

1173
01:13:57,460 --> 01:13:59,212
(Cash register dings)

1174
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,652
(Running water)

1175
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,252
(Key turns in lock)

1176
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,255
Eric?

1177
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,296
- Yes.
- (Water stops)

1178
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:36,177
Could you give me a towel, please?
They're on the bed.

1179
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,016
- Here.
- Thank you.

1180
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,051
Eric, would you get me my coat?
lt's in the closet.

1181
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:03,809
Here.

1182
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:26,372
l, er, thought l'd bring you
one of these.

1183
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:29,529
Thank you.

1184
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,618
And this.

1185
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,772
Help you pass the time.

1186
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:37,416
That's very sweet of you.

1187
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:40,811
Ah, l thought it would say it better
than l could that...

1188
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,334
(Sighs) l'm sorry.
Just nerves, l guess.

1189
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:44,773
l understand.

1190
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:48,809
All l mean is there's nothing in it
for you. You oughta go home.

1191
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,368
- No.
- Why do you waste your money on me?

1192
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,611
l'm not wasting my money.

1193
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:56,055
lt's yours, as well. l don't care
what you do with it.

1194
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,495
Burn it, tear it up,
do anything you want.

1195
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,858
You take it easy.
l only meant it for your sake.

1196
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:08,694
lf you had any consideration at all,
you wouldn't even mention money!

1197
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:11,931
OK. But anytime you want to,
you can always pull out.

1198
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:14,375
They'll fix you up with a divorce,
just for the asking.

1199
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:16,815
Tell them how l lied to you,
married you for your money.

1200
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,130
- l'm wanted for murder...
- You didn't murder that girl!

1201
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,780
- Maybe l did. You didn't ask me.
- l knew you didn't.

1202
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,215
- What do you know about me?
- All l know is that l love you!

1203
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:26,256
l love you, Eric, l love you!

1204
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:28,253
(Sobs)

1205
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,291
l could talk for the rest of the
night about my batting average.

1206
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:54,211
How many times l've struck out.

1207
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,053
Even when l hit a home run,
it isn't any different.

1208
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:00,338
Like the time in New York,
just before l came west.

1209
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,776
l'd started a publicity office.

1210
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,455
Like always,
it was great at the beginning.

1211
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,293
A guy comes along,
wants to buy the business.

1212
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,940
Offered me eight thousand bucks.
l took it.

1213
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,850
We had a big celebration that night.

1214
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:16,659
ln a couple of hours,
l'd lost half of it back.

1215
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,698
To him and his friends.

1216
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:21,931
l knew the dice were loaded,
but l couldn't prove it.

1217
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,092
Anyway, l came west.
Chicago for a while.

1218
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:27,652
Then Omaha.

1219
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,496
Las Vegas. That's where l dropped
the other half of the dough.

1220
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,579
When l was kicked off of that bus
at Walton,

1221
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,412
l only had one dollar left.

1222
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,338
And then...

1223
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:43,376
Ah, but why go on?

1224
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:47,209
l want to know everything about you.

1225
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,290
lt all adds up to only one thing.

1226
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:52,733
A washout.

1227
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,176
That's what you're looking at.
A complete washout at 30.

1228
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,736
Yeah, l'm finished OK.

1229
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:02,573
- You're not finished, Eric.
- Sure l am.

1230
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:04,013
l'm tired.

1231
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:06,216
Like l was a million years old.

1232
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:08,177
With a million jobs behind me.

1233
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,173
And girls.

1234
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:13,050
Chances l never followed up.

1235
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,849
Eric...

1236
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,258
did you care very much for... Stella?

1237
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:21,939
l don't know.

1238
01:18:22,620 --> 01:18:24,178
l guess l did.

1239
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:27,816
l even promised her l'd marry her.

1240
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,016
l can't figure it out now.

1241
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,216
Woulda lasted a couple of weeks.

1242
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,013
Maybe less.

1243
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,496
Anyway, that's all gone.

1244
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,016
Just as if it died with her.

1245
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:48,292
Yeah, that's over, too.

1246
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,413
Up in smoke,
like everything in my life.

1247
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:53,736
My school, the publicity game.

1248
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,572
Easy come, easy go.

1249
01:18:56,740 --> 01:19:00,096
l got everything by talking fast
in a world that goes for talk.

1250
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:02,930
And l end up with exactly nothing.

1251
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:10,654
Perhaps we can find what you want
when this has all cleared up.

1252
01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:12,492
<i>lf</i> it's cleared up.

1253
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:14,489
Eric...

1254
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:18,615
wouldn't it look better not to run
away, to go back to Walton?

1255
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,497
Sure, and go back to the chair.

1256
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,810
Or is it the gas chamber
in California?

1257
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:25,460
lf you're innocent,
there's nothing to worry about.

1258
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,933
Maybe that's the way it works
in your books,

1259
01:19:29,020 --> 01:19:32,569
but even as a kid, l always got
beaten up for something l didn't do.

1260
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:36,209
That's when l learned to run away
before it was too late.

1261
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,133
You're tired.

1262
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,452
Come, lie down.

1263
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,449
(Sighs)

1264
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,938
Tomorrow, we'll go
wherever you want to go.

1265
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,219
June,...

1266
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,332
why don't you just go on home?

1267
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,451
We're married. Remember?

1268
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,613
Besides, l... l wanna be with you.

1269
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,089
Why?

1270
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,898
l need you, Eric.

1271
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,338
You need me?

1272
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,088
Yes. You're my husband.

1273
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,738
And l'm your wife.

1274
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:18,170
(Whispers) Right out of a book.

1275
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:19,849
Again.

1276
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,494
Yes.

1277
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,658
Out of a book.

1278
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:27,013
''We were born to tread the earth
as angels,

1279
01:20:28,380 --> 01:20:31,338
to seek out heaven
this side of the sky,

1280
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:35,812
but they who race alone
shall stumble in the dark,

1281
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,652
and fall from grace.''

1282
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,288
Co on. Sounds good.

1283
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:46,215
''Then love alone
can make the fallen angel rise.''

1284
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:51,529
''For only two together
can enter paradise.''

1285
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,172
Four-and-a-half-minute eggs.

1286
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:22,013
l certainly married a man
with a peculiar taste.

1287
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:23,852
You can still get out of it.

1288
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,096
Promise you'll never say that again.

1289
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:28,738
OK, l promise.

1290
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:31,458
lt's ten o'clock.

1291
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:33,895
- The bank just opened.
- Let's go.

1292
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,332
(Man shouts outside)

1293
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:42,934
(Man) Cet your morning papers here!
Cet your papers!

1294
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,536
Early edition papers!

1295
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:48,012
Papers! This morning's papers!

1296
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,658
Paper, sir?

1297
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,772
You wait here, l'll be right back.

1298
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:53,213
Shine, sir?

1299
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,053
- Papers here! This morning's papers!
- All right.

1300
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,856
Papers! Early edition papers!

1301
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:02,617
Morning papers here!

1302
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:03,849
Papers!

1303
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,417
- Mrs Stanton?
- Yes?

1304
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:10,376
Could you come with us, please?

1305
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,776
(Car horns, engine revs)

1306
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:16,253
(Brakes squeak)

1307
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:17,693
(Car horn)

1308
01:23:24,620 --> 01:23:25,973
(Siren)

1309
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,729
Here.

1310
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:41,172
But l ain't finished yet!

1311
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:45,736
Now let's be sensible.
We've been here for hours.

1312
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,409
(Clanging)

1313
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:52,132
Tell us where he is.

1314
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,097
We're bound to find him soon.

1315
01:23:58,300 --> 01:23:59,449
(Clanging)

1316
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:03,459
Mrs Stanton,
you're not helping him or yourself.

1317
01:24:03,660 --> 01:24:06,220
Cetting mixed up in this murder
as an accessory after the fact.

1318
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,372
lf he doesn't wanna come back,
he must have a reason.

1319
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:12,494
What reason
could an innocent man have?

1320
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:15,936
- Assuming he's innocent.
- He is. He could never have done it.

1321
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:18,098
How can you say that?

1322
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:21,132
You know very little about him.

1323
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:25,532
He came into town a total stranger
and within a week, he married you.

1324
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:27,611
All to his credit, of course.

1325
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,011
But why this trust in him?

1326
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:34,619
A man who went out to see another
woman the night of your marriage.

1327
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,216
That's between the two of us.

1328
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,370
Ask Miss Clara Mills to come in.

1329
01:24:45,780 --> 01:24:47,338
Miss Mills, please.

1330
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,729
June.

1331
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:55,378
Sit down, Miss Mills.

1332
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:05,292
ln your sworn statement,
you identified this envelope,

1333
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,336
found in your safe deposit box,

1334
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:09,217
as the one Mr Stanton gave you.

1335
01:25:09,660 --> 01:25:12,015
Would you please repeat that
for your sister?

1336
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,649
Yes.

1337
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:17,490
This is the envelope he gave me
after they were married.

1338
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,650
Why did he want you to put it away?

1339
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,935
He said it contained
something valuable.

1340
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:23,373
Mm-hm.

1341
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,376
Would you care to see your husband's
valuable property?

1342
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:33,492
A blank piece of paper.

1343
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:39,533
Why would a man want to put a blank
piece of paper in your deposit box?

1344
01:25:40,620 --> 01:25:42,019
l'll tell you.

1345
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,092
lt gives him the excuse to open
the box, to steal your money.

1346
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:49,617
No, he wouldn't. Whatever he did,
he did because he was confused.

1347
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,258
He knew what he was doing.

1348
01:25:51,340 --> 01:25:53,854
He wanted that money so he could
run away with that girl.

1349
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:55,498
- But he didn't.
- No.

1350
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,333
He made the mistake
of coming back a married man.

1351
01:25:58,420 --> 01:26:00,729
She didn't want
anything to do with married men.

1352
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,572
They argued and he killed her.

1353
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,015
You're only assuming that.
You have no proof.

1354
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:07,853
All right. But why shield
a man who lied to you

1355
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,737
and wanted to steal from you,

1356
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:12,778
when you have positive proof
that he married you for your money?

1357
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:16,091
He didn't lie to me. And he isn't
guilty, l know he isn't.

1358
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:18,730
He only ran away because he had to.

1359
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:21,175
He's always had to run away,
all his life,

1360
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,411
even as a child, when he was beaten
for things he didn't do.

1361
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,330
He won't come back because of you.

1362
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,571
You won't give him a chance,
you only think the worst of him!

1363
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:33,333
Trying to make him guilty of murder
when he didn't do it!

1364
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:36,253
l tell you he didn't do it!
He didn't do it! (Sobs)

1365
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,412
Take her home now.

1366
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:43,293
(Bawls)

1367
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,900
You're responsible
she doesn't leave the house.

1368
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,538
(Continues to cry)

1369
01:27:01,300 --> 01:27:03,052
lt's not the same, Mr Judd.

1370
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,856
l think l'll sell the place.

1371
01:27:09,020 --> 01:27:10,453
(Bell tinkles)

1372
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:14,133
(Bell tinkles)

1373
01:27:18,180 --> 01:27:19,738
Hello, Pop.

1374
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:21,378
Some coffee, please.

1375
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,138
l knew you'd be back.

1376
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:35,609
Yeah.

1377
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:40,057
Well, drink your coffee and we'll
go down to the Chief of Police.

1378
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:41,493
Thanks.

1379
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:46,016
Enjoy San Francisco?

1380
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:48,854
Sure.

1381
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,616
- How come you didn't go after me?
- l didn't have to.

1382
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,899
And how come there wasn't a word
about Stella's murder in the papers?

1383
01:27:57,340 --> 01:28:00,218
- Why are you holding it back?
- Professional reasons.

1384
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:03,656
And was it for professional reasons
you beat up Atkins?

1385
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,613
When all the time
you knew he was innocent?

1386
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,131
You don't seem to appreciate
my methods, Mr Stanton.

1387
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,778
Frankly, no.

1388
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:14,296
That's what brought me back.

1389
01:28:14,740 --> 01:28:17,698
You know, l got worrying about you
in San Francisco.

1390
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:19,133
About me?

1391
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,698
Yes, Mr Judd.

1392
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,297
You know, you oughta stay home nights
with your bad health.

1393
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,938
Not walk the streets.

1394
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:30,936
Like the night you said you saw me
looking for Stella.

1395
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:32,892
More coffee, Pop.

1396
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:36,734
You weren't strong enough to keep
on working on the New York force.

1397
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:39,380
Why are you working so hard
on this case?

1398
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:42,611
- Maybe you better slow down.
- Don't you worry about me.

1399
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,258
l'm OK.

1400
01:28:44,700 --> 01:28:47,055
l said l wanted more coffee, Pop.
Cet it.

1401
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,779
l don't worry about you, Mr Judd.
Not anymore.

1402
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:55,379
Not since l called a friend of mine
in the DA's office in New York.

1403
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:00,056
He assured me you were in
perfect health when you left there.

1404
01:29:00,660 --> 01:29:04,619
They retired you from the force after
you ruined another man's health.

1405
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,373
Almost killed him,
in a routine investigation.

1406
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:11,009
They would've sent you up,
if you hadn't had such a good record.

1407
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,410
That was before you started
to enjoy your work too much.

1408
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,775
Wearing gloves, you know.
And l checked up on...

1409
01:29:16,860 --> 01:29:18,418
That's enough.

1410
01:29:19,180 --> 01:29:20,852
Save it for the Chief.

1411
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:23,132
There y'are, Pop.

1412
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,856
Oh, you remember that watch?

1413
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:28,693
The one with the three diamonds
that belonged to Stella?

1414
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,931
- Find out who bought it for her?
- Perhaps.

1415
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:36,294
You made your fatal mistake, Judd,
when you had June arrested.

1416
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:39,375
Oh, you scared me at first,
all right,

1417
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:41,052
but then l stopped,

1418
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,937
and l began to think.

1419
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,773
And l kept right on thinking
about that watch,

1420
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:49,296
and l started a little
routine investigation of my own.

1421
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:53,214
The result is the Walton police
will get a wire from San Francisco.

1422
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:55,860
They'll know who bought it
tomorrow morning,

1423
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:57,896
unless you admit it tonight.

1424
01:29:58,900 --> 01:30:00,253
Shall we go?

1425
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:02,649
Oh, l came in a police car,
they're outside.

1426
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,810
l thought it'd be more convenient.

1427
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:07,773
Sit down.

1428
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,777
You don't mind if l finish my coffee?

1429
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:15,693
You're insane.
The police are right outside.

1430
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,611
Perhaps l am insane.

1431
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:24,089
Perhaps this might've been
the perfect crime

1432
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,932
if l hadn't dropped the watch.

1433
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:27,858
But l doubt it.

1434
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:30,818
- There's always some slip.
- Yeah, there always is.

1435
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:34,253
You understand.

1436
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:37,570
You know what she was like.

1437
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,535
You couldn't get away
from her either.

1438
01:30:41,420 --> 01:30:43,980
Two years l came in here
and drank coffee.

1439
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:46,016
Just to get a look at her.

1440
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:49,376
Day after day for two years.

1441
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,652
lnsane, perhaps.

1442
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,408
Those evenings when she went out
with other men,

1443
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,173
while l was waiting for her
in the shadow of the porch...

1444
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:03,252
Remember three nights ago,
when you brought her home,

1445
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:04,898
and kissed her?

1446
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,532
l was standing there.

1447
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:10,858
lnsane, perhaps.

1448
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,412
Night before last,
when she was out with Atkins,

1449
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,210
after he left, l went up.

1450
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:23,054
When she told me she wouldn't wait
any longer for my wife to divorce me,

1451
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:27,019
that she was going to marry that
slot-machine operator the next day,

1452
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:29,011
l hit her.

1453
01:31:29,780 --> 01:31:32,533
Unfortunately,
l didn't remember my ring.

1454
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:36,580
Cet out of the way, Mr Stanton!
l'm gonna kill him!

1455
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:39,128
He murdered Stella!
l'm gonna kill him!

1456
01:31:39,220 --> 01:31:40,573
(Bell tinkles)

1457
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,693
Let's go.

1458
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,938

1459
01:32:00,020 --> 01:32:03,092

1461
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,456
You gotta forget it, Pop.

1462
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:17,376
No, l'll never forget Stella.

1463
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:19,379
You will.

1464
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,650
l felt the same way myself, until...

1465
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:25,336
Well, you'll find yourself, Pop.

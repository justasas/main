1
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:12,810
My name is John Northwood.

2
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:16,810
And this is a story of a girl,

3
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,712
and her gift,

4
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:22,016
a gift that shook the world.

5
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,158
Police have reported the disappearance

6
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,205
of a missing
three-year-old girl in York.

7
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:17,216
The news came when neighbors described
hearing two gunshots from next door.

8
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:20,387
Police are still searching
for the missing girl's parents

9
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:22,243
who've also disappeared.

10
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:29,035
Two bodies were found in a lake on
the outskirts of York this morning

11
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:31,195
around 10 a.m.

12
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:34,174
They're believed to be the parents
of the missing three-year-old

13
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:37,850
who vanished suddenly from
her home a fortnight ago.

14
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:41,223
Police are continuing
the search for her whereabouts.

15
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:49,536
Today marks the 20th anniversary
of the York Angel,

16
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:53,543
whose family was tragically
murdered in 1992.

17
00:01:53,544 --> 00:01:57,449
The world still asks the
question if she is still alive.

18
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,788
And if so, where is she now?

19
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:29,302

Sir.

30
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,260
The gentleman's here to see you.

31
00:03:52,272 --> 00:03:55,274
Ah. Send him in, will you?

32
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,680
Your staff seems a little bit
on edge, eh, Raven?

33
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:08,200
Well, what with today's events,
they have every reason to be.

34
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:11,423
Please, take a seat.

35
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,540
So, tell me...

36
00:04:22,556 --> 00:04:23,938
Why does a wealthy man,

37
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:27,629
who owns one of the most profitable
private hospitals in the country,

38
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,350
want with a man like me?

39
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,435
I need you to locate someone for me.

40
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,181
And I want you
to bring her back unharmed.

41
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:41,014
You know my services don't come cheap?

42
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:43,516
I'm quite aware of your reputation, Max.

43
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,157
And your methods.

44
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,659
You're a nasty piece of work, Max.

45
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:53,097
But you're exactly what I need.

46
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,163
Okay, then.

47
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:58,461
Tell me about her.

48
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:02,170
Her name is Kyra.

49
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:07,128
She's a mentally disturbed
patient of mine

50
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:09,321
and she needs special attention

51
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:12,132
due to her abilities.

52
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:16,076
As a child, she had
incredible psychic skills.

53
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:19,112
She could move small toys
without touching them.

54
00:05:20,184 --> 00:05:22,612
I experimented on her mind.

55
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:29,026
As Kyra grew, so did her abilities.

56
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:32,161
But she became unstable.

57
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:35,070
She began to fail
the psychic tests on purpose.

58
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,347
So we had to take drastic steps,

59
00:05:39,348 --> 00:05:42,485
injecting her with drugs
which suppressed her mind

60
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:45,118
and allowed us to keep her
under control.

61
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:49,327
Of course, there were side effects.

62
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:52,536
The drugs affected her mind
and she began to hallucinate.

63
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:57,411
She spoke of terrible visions
of death and destruction.

64
00:05:57,412 --> 00:06:00,211
Kyra believed that the world
was coming to an end.

65
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:04,289
Her mind was fractured.

66
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,431
But needless to say, she's the
most dangerous girl on Earth.

67
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:11,826
She is not my flesh and blood,

68
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,503
but she is my property.

69
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,251
She could bring down a helicopter
in a matter of seconds.

70
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,329
If she wished.

71
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:24,812
Is that why you wanted her back so soon?

72
00:06:26,927 --> 00:06:29,557
I think I might have to double my price.

73
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:33,203
She was aided by this man, Randall.

74
00:06:33,204 --> 00:06:34,486
I believe you know him.

75
00:06:34,506 --> 00:06:35,586
Yeah, I know him.

76
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,429
He's my old mentor.

77
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,704
Trained me and a few other assassins.

78
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,705
Till I decided to work for myself.

79
00:06:41,718 --> 00:06:45,523
Somehow, he discovered everything
about Kyra and the experiments,

80
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:48,458
which in the eyes of others
would be classed as

81
00:06:48,462 --> 00:06:51,430
illegal and a crime against humanity.

82
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:54,754
She could be anywhere right now.

83
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:58,712
Well, fortunately, Randall
commandeered one of my vehicles

84
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:01,714
and they're all fitted
with a GPS tracker.

85
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:04,517
I'll provide you with
anything you require.

86
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,464
I need two vehicles.
One jeep and one van.

87
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:12,917
And a group of your best men.

88
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,304
If this Kyra's as dangerous
as you say she is,

89
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,345
then we need to be prepared
for whatever she throws at us.

90
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,536
I'll see to it.

91
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:28,447
Oh, and, Max,

92
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,261
if you see Randall on your troubles,

93
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,638
I'll handsomely reward you for his head.

94
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,269
Raven, I'll gladly do it for free.

95
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:14,688
Keep running, Kyra.

96
00:08:17,609 --> 00:08:19,666
Now the hallway should be clear. Go.

97
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,048
When you get to the end, there
should be an elevator on your left.

98
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:29,985
Take it down to the car park
and I'll meet you there.

99
00:08:30,965 --> 00:08:32,313
Why are you helping me?

100
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:35,672
My name is Randall.
I'm here to get you out.

101
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:38,538
We need to get you to safety, Kyra.

102
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:41,047
I'll be sending you to a friend
called John Northwood.

103
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:43,084
He'll be able to help you.

104
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:45,816
Don't worry, Kyra.
Everything will be all right.

105
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:58,018
Excuse me.

106
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:02,573
Do you know a John Northwood?

107
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:05,263
Who?

108
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:06,938
John Northwood?

109
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,303
I was told he'd be here.

110
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,576
Never heard of him.

111
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:48,134
I heard you've been looking for me.

112
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:51,641
Who sent you?

113
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:53,677
Randall.

114
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,383
Follow me.

115
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,841
Apologize for the cloak and dagger.

116
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,147
A lot of people
are still looking for me.

117
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:10,945
All for different reasons.

118
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,181
Please, take a seat.

119
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:20,421
So what's your name?

120
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:22,189
Kyra.

121
00:12:22,212 --> 00:12:23,325
Just "Kyra"?

122
00:12:24,449 --> 00:12:25,798
Yes.

123
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:27,268
Fine.

124
00:12:27,287 --> 00:12:29,783
How well do you know Randall?

125
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,219
Not that well.
I'd never seen him till today.

126
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:35,761
Well, tell me your story.

127
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:39,197
I'm all ears.

128
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:41,971
If never been able
to recall my memories well.

129
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:45,540
I've always had trouble.

130
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,249
Randall helped me escape the hospital.

131
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,413
I've never left before.

132
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,854
He said I'd die if he didn't.

133
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:58,498
None of this makes any sense to me.

134
00:12:58,506 --> 00:13:01,540
Raven has taken care of me
since I was a child.

135
00:13:02,445 --> 00:13:04,299
And now there's men after me.

136
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,169
Chuffin' hell fire.

137
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,208
- The thing is, Tyra...
- Kyra.

138
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:13,162
Whatever. You're not the first
person to come looking for my help.

139
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,287
Randall used to do it all the time.

140
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,221
Whenever he thought
there was gonna be trouble,

141
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:21,475
he's say, "Go find John,
Go find John. He'll help you."

142
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:23,398
He always used to get me into his shit.

143
00:13:24,114 --> 00:13:25,497
What's your point?

144
00:13:25,516 --> 00:13:26,798
I'm old.

145
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:30,315
If you'd walked through
my door ten years ago,

146
00:13:30,324 --> 00:13:32,044
I might've been able to help.

147
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,266
But you're a decade too late.
I don't protect people anymore.

148
00:13:38,972 --> 00:13:41,467
All the answers are on here.

149
00:13:41,476 --> 00:13:43,263
He said you should look at it.

150
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,526
It'll explain everything.

151
00:13:44,547 --> 00:13:47,009
I'm done, Kyra.

152
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:49,616
Can't be involved in this shit again.

153
00:13:49,623 --> 00:13:52,960
I've got a friend who
might be able to help.

154
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:55,221
The best thing for you to do now
is go wait for Randall in the bar

155
00:13:56,033 --> 00:13:57,381
and be on your way.

156
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:38,821
No doubt you've already met Kyra

157
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,299
and tried to figure out
what I've got you into now.

158
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,464
Well,

159
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:48,386
over the past year, I've been trying
to infiltrate a man called Raven

160
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,983
and his secret organization.

161
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:54,830
He portrays himself
as a private hospital owner,

162
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,137
but that's just a smokescreen to
hide all his illegal activities.

163
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:03,243
For nearly 20 years, he's performed
so many unforgivable tests on Kyra

164
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:05,200
to enhance her abilities,

165
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,080
I don't know
what she's fully capable of.

166
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:11,019
But I know
that she needs to be protected.

167
00:15:11,024 --> 00:15:13,890
She cannot return to Raven.

168
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:15,784
If she's captured again,

169
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:19,303
an innocent life will be lost.

170
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:22,171
Now, I bet you're wondering
why you should even care.

171
00:15:22,176 --> 00:15:24,907
And I know you gave up
this life a long time ago.

172
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,787
And we didn't part on very good terms,

173
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:33,058
but I had no one else to turn to.

174
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,264
Kyra's been dealt
a cruel hand in her life.

175
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:39,772
Please help her to start a new one.

176
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:44,111
By doing this, I know
I endangered myself.

177
00:15:44,112 --> 00:15:47,215
This will probably be the last
message I'll send to anyone.

178
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,469
Well,

179
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:51,871
I...

180
00:15:51,891 --> 00:15:53,982
I just wanted you to know, John,

181
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:58,434
that you were my best student,
and I'm very proud of you.

182
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:01,033
And I know you'll make the right choice.

183
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,193
Goodbye.

184
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,169
Move in.

185
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,265
Hands up, civilian.

186
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,577
Let's go.

187
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:29,730
John Northwood.

188
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,743
Get inside.

189
00:18:36,763 --> 00:18:38,246
Now!

190
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,547
Fire!

191
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:13,569
John?

192
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,841
Still alive?

193
00:19:17,463 --> 00:19:19,183
I wanna make a deal with you.

194
00:19:22,304 --> 00:19:23,518
Give us the girl.

195
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,162
And I promise.

196
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,240
You won't come to any more harm.

197
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,824
Unless you wanna beg for your life.

198
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,392
Like that coward, Randall.

199
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,499
I need one of you to go in
there now and take him out!

200
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,502
Report.

201
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,307
Target down.

202
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:38,083
And the girl?

203
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,916
Bringing her out now.

204
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:41,213
Good.

205
00:21:18,328 --> 00:21:20,351
Goodbye, John.

206
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:33,563
Don't shoot!

207
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:35,137
Repeat, don't shoot!

208
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,333
Well done, John!

209
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:17,069
Well done.

210
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:26,221
Nobody's following us.
I think we lost them.

211
00:22:39,362 --> 00:22:40,643
Thank you.

212
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,917
It's all right.

213
00:22:45,037 --> 00:22:46,685
No, really.

214
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:52,182
You could've just left me
to die back there.

215
00:22:52,183 --> 00:22:55,082
But you didn't, so, thanks.

216
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:59,047
Have you got that bit of paper
I gave you earlier?

217
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,281
Ta.

218
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:06,124
Have you got your seat belt on?

219
00:23:17,825 --> 00:23:19,780
Target's name is John Northwood.

220
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,200
Him and I trained together
with the same mentor.

221
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,487
Tell me about him.

222
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,921
He's highly intelligent.

223
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:29,896
Trained in hand to hand combat.

224
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:32,467
And crack shot with a gun.

225
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:35,011
Leave no room for mistakes
on this one, Max.

226
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:37,683
You know how important
it is to get Kyra back.

227
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,696
Let's hope this John Northwood
can be taken care of.

228
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,259
I'm better. I'll find him.

229
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:46,522
And I'll kill him.

230
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,561
See that you do.

231
00:23:48,575 --> 00:23:50,969
Prove to me that you're as good
as you say you are.

232
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:18,407
Is this the place?

233
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,552
You wait here.

234
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,914
Got you now, pal!

235
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,554
John! Thought you were a burglar.
I could've killed you!

236
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:59,039
Good job you didn't.

237
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,575
Good to see you, man.

238
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:01,707
Yeah, you too.

239
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:13,845
Years of bounty hunting and this
is what he does in his spare time.

240
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,999
I like them.

241
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:19,609
I really like them.

242
00:25:19,625 --> 00:25:21,074
Just thought I'd give drawing a go.

243
00:25:21,094 --> 00:25:22,712
Nah, we've got no time for this.

244
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,775
Just a quick one.

245
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:24,878
What is it?

246
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,856
Just taste. Cheers.

247
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:35,608
Ah, that hit the spot. So tell me,

248
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,788
what's a gorgeous girl like you
doing with this fella here?

249
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,441
Billy, I need to tell you something.

250
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:42,675
It's about Randall.

251
00:25:43,464 --> 00:25:45,217
He died a few days ago.

252
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,852
Oh, God, no.

253
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,792
That's why we're here.

254
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:49,987
We need your help.

255
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:53,094
What do you need from me, exactly?

256
00:25:53,113 --> 00:25:56,986
Kyra's being hunted by a man
called Raven and his mercenaries.

257
00:25:56,987 --> 00:25:59,549
We're not quite sure
about their intentions.

258
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,614
But Kyra believes we need
to head to the North.

259
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:08,571
It's very important that
we find it before they do.

260
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:11,641
John tells me you know the
North better than anyone.

261
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,768
I don't know what to say.
You're both nuts!

262
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,028
Billy, we're serious.

263
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,713
No, no, no. You expect
me to believe this?

264
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,811
Kyra, I've just met you.
You're a lovely girl,

265
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:22,556
but, John, are you on something?
We can get you some help.

266
00:26:22,562 --> 00:26:24,517
We're being honest, Billy.

267
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:26,724
Randall risked his life to save Kyra

268
00:26:26,736 --> 00:26:28,185
and he died doing it.

269
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:30,025
He wouldn't have done that for nothing.

270
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,895
We both know that.

271
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,496
They want to use her for her powers.

272
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:37,006
Go on, then. Go on, then. Prove it.

273
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:41,570
Fine.

274
00:26:43,096 --> 00:26:45,658
He wants a demonstration,
I'll give him one.

275
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,583
What a load of pish!

276
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:09,029
I've heard some crap but you...

277
00:27:13,112 --> 00:27:15,742
Holy shit! How did you do that?

278
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:19,321
I'm still learning. I guess I
can only do it when I'm angry.

279
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:21,311
So you can do more
than just move things?

280
00:27:22,027 --> 00:27:23,172
Maybe.

281
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,151
I need your help, Billy.

282
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,089
We need your help.

283
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:31,003
Me and you together, side
by side like the old days.

284
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:32,626
You know I would, pal.

285
00:27:32,644 --> 00:27:34,937
But I'm a family man.

286
00:27:34,948 --> 00:27:37,038
My daughter's turning ten soon.

287
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:38,905
And she needs her dad.

288
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,674
It's not that I don't want to help.

289
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,747
I've got some gear upstairs. A map,

290
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,660
some hunting gear.
You're welcome to take that.

291
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:49,270
Thanks very much. Let's get
this stuff in the car.

292
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,665
You better hurry and tidy up
before your wife gets back.

293
00:27:51,675 --> 00:27:54,946
Ha! And she's gonna do her a nut.
Do me a favor though.

294
00:27:54,947 --> 00:27:58,252
If you find the prick who killed
Randall, give him one from me.

295
00:27:58,252 --> 00:28:01,052
I will. Don't worry, Billy.

296
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,979
Right. I'll go and get the stuff.

297
00:28:11,474 --> 00:28:13,026
I have got one question.

298
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:17,216
What's so important about
this building in the North?

299
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:20,892
I don't know why, but I think my
visions are trying to tell me something.

300
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,212
I'm scared, John. I don't know
what we're going to find.

301
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,194
Well, whatever's waiting for us,
we'll be ready for them.

302
00:29:44,361 --> 00:29:46,249
There's a building close by.

303
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:49,050
Kyra?

304
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:51,116
Kyra!

305
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,997
You're supposed to stick by me.

306
00:30:02,357 --> 00:30:06,156
This is it, John. This is
where I was supposed to come.

307
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:11,065
Be on your guard. Come on.

308
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:44,042
Can you remember anything?

309
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,280
From your visions.

310
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:48,893
It's hard to describe.

311
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,126
I feel like I've been here before.

312
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,271
I can see myself.

313
00:31:03,257 --> 00:31:05,213
But it doesn't feel real.

314
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,488
Kyra, there's nothing here.

315
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:13,032
I've been thinking...

316
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,132
These images might not be
what they seem.

317
00:31:18,249 --> 00:31:19,496
I know it makes no sense, but...

318
00:31:19,518 --> 00:31:21,068
Quiet.

319
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,237
Get behind me.

320
00:31:39,584 --> 00:31:42,652
You know what? I thought this was
going to be a lot more difficult.

321
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,922
Seems age has finally
caught up with you, John.

322
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:51,570
And here he is!
The great John Northwood.

323
00:31:53,106 --> 00:31:55,400
And his little sidekick.

324
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,567
She's more loyal than you, Max.

325
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,177
You betrayed everything we stood for.

326
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,039
Randall trained us to be the best

327
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:04,684
and you murdered him in cold blood.

328
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,647
You know what, Kyra?

329
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,516
Raven wanted me
to bring you back unharmed.

330
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:12,452
But I can't say the same for him!

331
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,060
You're gonna shoot, John?

332
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:18,494
Eh?

333
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:20,100
Still got the nerve?

334
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:22,568
Well, I'm the best!

335
00:32:32,738 --> 00:32:34,357
Well, don't just stand there, then!

336
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,472
Get them!

337
00:33:16,644 --> 00:33:18,229
Main target is hit.

338
00:33:23,622 --> 00:33:25,308
Whoo! Isn't this fun?

339
00:33:25,325 --> 00:33:27,112
You need to get out of here.
No, I'm not leaving you.

340
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,486
Go now. Go. Go!

341
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:18,490
No!

342
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:40,565
Be careful, boys.

343
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:43,538
She's not your average kind of girl.

344
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,781
Sir, she's fighting back.

345
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,607
Keep moving, men.

346
00:37:44,484 --> 00:37:45,731
So,

347
00:37:45,753 --> 00:37:50,092
you're the man who's been
causing me all this grief, eh?

348
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:53,465
I must say, you don't look much
like a bounty hunter to me.

349
00:37:57,072 --> 00:37:58,488
Where's Kyra?

350
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:03,447
In isolation. Away from you.

351
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,248
I know everything about you, John.

352
00:38:06,253 --> 00:38:08,580
I know that Randall
took you in as a child

353
00:38:08,591 --> 00:38:11,423
when your family perished
in a house fire.

354
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:13,654
He trained you to become
a bounty hunter.

355
00:38:14,734 --> 00:38:16,522
Just like him.

356
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,560
I don't need a history lesson.

357
00:38:20,376 --> 00:38:22,670
I have a question for you, John.

358
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,419
Why does a man with
such skills as you have

359
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,185
land yourself in a mess like this?

360
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:31,282
This mess is something you began.

361
00:38:31,294 --> 00:38:33,183
You're the one to blame.

362
00:38:35,601 --> 00:38:37,693
But I believe there are a few
things that you should know

363
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:43,413
before I let our mutual friend,
Max, take care of you.

364
00:38:43,414 --> 00:38:46,078
Kyra has always been gifted,

365
00:38:46,085 --> 00:38:48,749
ever since she was young.

366
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:52,264
Unfortunately, her parents
didn't think the same way.

367
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,292
So I...

368
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,223
Did what I had to do.

369
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:02,444
We conducted tests on her
every single day.

370
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:05,379
And her abilities improved.

371
00:39:06,586 --> 00:39:09,081
Kyra was a miracle.

372
00:39:10,659 --> 00:39:13,222
She was, the miracle.

373
00:39:14,665 --> 00:39:19,139
But over the past few years,
Kyra became unstable.

374
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,313
She began to disobey orders and
accidents became more frequent.

375
00:39:23,314 --> 00:39:28,454
The more enraged she becomes,
the more powerful she can be.

376
00:39:28,455 --> 00:39:33,495
So as a precaution we used drugs
to regain control of her mind.

377
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,202
And it worked for a while.

378
00:39:37,203 --> 00:39:40,306
So we decided the best way
to keep her mind confused

379
00:39:40,308 --> 00:39:43,411
was the use of fabricated memories.

380
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:46,482
A series of images repeated on a loop.

381
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:49,654
Images she could relate to.

382
00:39:49,657 --> 00:39:52,658
The key image was the
structure in the forest.

383
00:39:53,897 --> 00:39:57,369
We knew that if she ever did escape,

384
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:01,214
she would find her way there and
we would be ready for extraction.

385
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:11,425
The only thing I didn't
count on was you.

386
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:15,530
Kyra is a threat to the world.

387
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:19,243
And you've been protecting her
all this time.

388
00:40:20,741 --> 00:40:22,191
She was afraid.

389
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:26,448
I did what I had to do to protect her.

390
00:40:26,451 --> 00:40:29,316
And let me tell you right now,
I am her protector.

391
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:32,953
And I'll do anything to make her safe.

392
00:40:32,961 --> 00:40:35,490
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

393
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:41,680
The time has come
to set everything right.

394
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:44,229
What are you gonna do?

395
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:48,640
Correct my mistake.

396
00:41:21,374 --> 00:41:22,993
Begin the procedure.

397
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:12,870
What the hell?

398
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:18,487
The patient's escaping, sir.

399
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,765
Bring her down!

400
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,872
Bring her down, you imbeciles!

401
00:42:27,884 --> 00:42:30,750
You hear me? Bring her down!

402
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,395
Down here.

403
00:43:07,215 --> 00:43:10,048
Sir, the patient...

404
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,045
She's gone.

405
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,992
Repeat, the patient has gone.

406
00:43:28,751 --> 00:43:30,605
Go ahead, John!

407
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:31,969
Pull the trigger.

408
00:43:33,692 --> 00:43:35,986
Do it.

409
00:43:35,996 --> 00:43:38,255
Killing me won't do you any good, John.

410
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:41,152
You got what you wanted.

411
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,591
You got your miracle.

412
00:43:44,644 --> 00:43:48,850
Look, I need you, and I need you both.

413
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:51,987
To stop Kyra from killing anyone else.

414
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:10,717
We're following her path on the GPS.

415
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,710
She's heading for the Scottish border.

416
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:15,677
Where would she go?

417
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,224
Somewhere where she's been before.

418
00:44:21,337 --> 00:44:23,968
Somewhere with a high population.

419
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:27,364
A city, most likely.

420
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,674
Nah, city's too big.

421
00:44:34,326 --> 00:44:35,977
Get your helicopter ready.

422
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:38,210
Where are we going?

423
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:39,878
Gretna.

424
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:11,281
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
On behalf of Karl and Aliscia,

425
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:15,524
I'd like to welcome to this, their
wedding day, here at Anvil Hall.

426
00:46:15,525 --> 00:46:18,863
I'm sure they'll join with me in wishing
them every happiness and success

427
00:46:18,864 --> 00:46:21,326
as they begin their married
life together today.

428
00:46:46,443 --> 00:46:51,316
So, Karl and Aliscia, I now
pronounce you husband and wife.

429
00:46:51,317 --> 00:46:52,903
You may kiss the bride.

430
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:04,122
You two, come with me.

431
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,549
John!

432
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:24,726
What's going on down there?

433
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:28,143
We're under attack.
Kyra's created these monsters.

434
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:30,336
Billy's with me, but we need help.

435
00:48:30,347 --> 00:48:32,540
We can't let these things
leave this church.

436
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:34,137
We're outnumbered.

437
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:36,043
Max! Max!

438
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:38,340
Send our weapons down!

439
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:51,731
I've got the package.

440
00:48:53,352 --> 00:48:55,004
Good luck, John.

441
00:49:53,652 --> 00:49:55,236
Excuse me.

442
00:49:57,391 --> 00:49:59,144
No one leaves my service

443
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:01,578
until I say so.

444
00:51:44,801 --> 00:51:48,679
Just go. I'll be fine. I'm gonna
take care of the rest of these guys.

445
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:52,701
Guys, we got a problem. Kyra's not here.

446
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:53,894
Those things are heading to town.

447
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,838
We've got to get to town quick.

448
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,935
Get moving, John.

449
00:51:59,258 --> 00:52:02,394
What's going on? The road's
been blocked by these things.

450
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:04,554
We need to get to town, fast.

451
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,522
We can't go that way. It's blocked.

452
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:11,532
Looks like that way's blocked too.

453
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,366
We'll have to try and
make it round that way now!

454
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:13,103
Aaron, clean up on aisle two.

455
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:23,674
Aaron?

456
00:53:25,066 --> 00:53:26,449
Aaron!

457
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:31,051
You all right?

458
00:54:31,074 --> 00:54:32,322
Yeah, thanks for that.

459
00:54:33,178 --> 00:54:35,606
Here, can you handle a gun?

460
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:36,897
I don't know.

461
00:54:41,892 --> 00:54:43,342
But I've never shot anybody before.

462
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:46,093
There's a first time for
everything. Come on, let's go.

463
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:50,255
Come on.

464
00:54:55,749 --> 00:54:56,963
Good job.

465
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:02,853
Raven, I've got a man on the ground.

466
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:04,985
But I'm still searching for Kyra.

467
00:56:46,531 --> 00:56:48,925
Maurice, it's not a premier package.

468
00:57:53,307 --> 00:57:54,926
There you are.

469
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,280
Shoot her! Shoot her!

470
00:58:02,522 --> 00:58:04,276
Take the bloody shot!

471
01:01:41,483 --> 01:01:42,866
Stop right there, Kyra.

472
01:01:45,456 --> 01:01:47,042
Isn't this what you wanted?

473
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:51,088
Was I too strong?

474
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:53,628
Too powerful beyond your control?

475
01:01:58,044 --> 01:02:00,438
Were you afraid of me?

476
01:02:00,448 --> 01:02:02,370
Afraid of what I might do?

477
01:03:08,193 --> 01:03:10,418
I'm not done yet, old man.

478
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,759
That one's for Randall.

479
01:04:31,129 --> 01:04:32,073
Kyra!

480
01:04:32,098 --> 01:04:34,930
Don't stand in my way.
I need to do this.

481
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:36,183
No, you don't.

482
01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:39,059
He took everything from me.

483
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:41,133
Everything I had in this world!

484
01:04:41,146 --> 01:04:43,338
You have no idea what that feels like!

485
01:04:44,919 --> 01:04:47,009
More than you know, Kyra.

486
01:04:47,022 --> 01:04:48,708
You don't know the life I've lived.

487
01:04:50,128 --> 01:04:54,039
I was in a dark, miserable
existence before you arrived.

488
01:04:57,272 --> 01:04:58,959
You saved me.

489
01:05:00,244 --> 01:05:01,997
Let me help you.

490
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,280
Don't need to run away anymore,

491
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,314
you can start a new life.

492
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:12,654
I can be the father you never had.

493
01:05:43,215 --> 01:05:44,698
Kyra!

494
01:05:58,273 --> 01:05:59,823
I'm sorry, John.

495
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:10,680
John? I'm sorry.

496
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,074
John, I'm so sorry.

497
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:14,048
It's fine, it's fine. We can fix this.

498
01:08:14,063 --> 01:08:15,344
No, no, no!

499
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,720
John...

500
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:22,336
if you truly care about me,

501
01:08:23,178 --> 01:08:25,168
you have to let me go.

502
01:08:35,098 --> 01:08:37,020
Will you stay with me?

503
01:08:38,169 --> 01:08:39,990
I don't wanna be alone.

504
01:11:06,581 --> 01:11:07,693
Hey, Billy. How's it going, mate?

505
01:11:07,716 --> 01:11:10,212
Hey, pal. Just thought
to check up on you.

506
01:11:10,821 --> 01:11:12,305
If just been thinking,

507
01:11:12,323 --> 01:11:14,346
I'm thinking of continuing
Randall's work.

508
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:16,619
There's people out there
who need to be protected.

509
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:19,159
I'm starting a new league
of bounty hunters.

510
01:11:19,168 --> 01:11:20,820
Ah, well. If you think that's best.

511
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:24,176
And listen, Billy.
Thank you for all your help.

512
01:11:24,177 --> 01:11:25,660
I really appreciate it.

513
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:26,960
I'm here if you need me, pal.

514
01:11:26,981 --> 01:11:29,139
I'll speak to you later, mate.
Speak to you soon, mate.

515
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,466
Bye for now. Bye.

516
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:11,598
Hello?

517
01:12:11,621 --> 01:12:13,644
Is this John Northwood?

518
01:12:13,658 --> 01:12:15,176
Yeah. Who's calling?

519
01:12:15,194 --> 01:12:16,982
That doesn't matter.

520
01:12:16,997 --> 01:12:19,324
I have a client
who wants to speak to you.

521
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:21,964
I'm a bit busy just now. I can
give you somebody else's number...

522
01:12:21,972 --> 01:12:25,108
I insist that you speak to her.

523
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:26,595
What's her name?

524
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:28,097
I'll put her on.

525
01:12:31,554 --> 01:12:33,004
John?

526
01:14:20,568 --> 01:14:22,523
What's been going on in here?

1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,200
When God created man
a jealous Lucifer

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,000
mounted a great
rebellion in heaven.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
His army of angels
was defeated

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,100
and forever banished
from paradise.

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,100
These angels the fallen
abandoned Lucifer

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,700
choosing to live on earth
among the pleasures of humans.

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,500
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,700
children called Nephilim:
by the power of angels

9
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,800
with the souls of man.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
Angry the Creator
flooded the earth

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,600
killing the Nephilim and driving
the fallen into hiding.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,300
He sent the Powers
fierce warrior angels

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,200
to hunt those who
survived the flood.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
but there was hope
for the fallenn a prcy.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
A Nephilim would be born
who would redeem them

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,800
and return them
to paradise.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,700
So the fallen watched...
and waited.

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,200
Tom?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,900
Lori?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,100
Tom? Lori?

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,300
Come Nephilim!

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,700
Meet your death!

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,900
Huh.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,900
Oh man that was wicked.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,400
Oh...

26
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,400
Hey buddy.

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh hey hey
stop come on.

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
All right come on come on.

29
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Hey a little lighter
on the noise okay?

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,900
I got
a killer headache.

31
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,900
Surprise.

32
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,600
Hey
Happy Birthday!

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,700
Happy Birthday!

34
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,200
Don't let it go out.
I got it.

35
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,500
Okay.
We got it.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Here it is.
There you go.
Make a wish.

37
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,400
Yay.
Nice.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,200
Thank you Lori.
Thanks Tom.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,300
Wow. Um you guys
didn't have to do this.

40
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,700
Didn't have to?
It's your 18th birthday.

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,800
It's like the start
of a whole new life.

42
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah. And we'll
have a party tonight

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
but we just wanted
to uh to--

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,800
how happy we are
that you were born

45
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,400
that last three years
you've been with us

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
have been just wonderful.

47
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,300
Yeah.

48
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,400
Thank you.

49
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,400
I mean yeah.
Thanks a lot.

50
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
Now you know
the Corbett tradition.

51
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,800
Birthday boy gets
to pick dinner

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,700
so what'll it be?

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,300
Um well if it's
not too much trouble

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,600
maybe Tom can make
his spaghetti sauce?

55
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,200
Yeah. Yeah?

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,500
Of course not.
It's no trouble.

57
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,200
I'll make it
extra-special.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,700
It already is hon.

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Okay. All right.

60
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000
Well um I got to get
to work so...

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,500
we'll see you
and save your appetite.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,100
Maybe after the party
we can work on the Caddy.

63
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,300
Cool.
All right.

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,700
That was very nice of you
and brave.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
I can talk him out of it.

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,200
I'll tell him we're
out of the ingredients.

67
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,500
No no I'm actually uh...

68
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm beginning to like
Tom's sauce.

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,300
Or at least
get used to it.

70
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
How'd you get to be
such a good kid huh?

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
I got to get Stevie up.

72
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
So enjoy your breakfast

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,700
and happy birthday.

74
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,700
How's it taste?

75
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,000
this just arrived

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
he said it wa urgent

77
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,200
it's late You may go now

78
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,700
But you have another meeting

79
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,000
it's no t neccessary for you to be here

80
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
I'll see you tomorrow

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
what was that

82
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,300
just the wind

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,600
we're on the eighty-first floor

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,800
Hello Fallen.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,400
Verchiel.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,000
You look like you were
expecting someone.

87
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,000
Who was coming
to visit you Samchial?

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,500
No one Your Worship.

89
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
Look we find you

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,500
lying to us.

91
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,400
What's that in your hair?

92
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Is it gray?

93
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
I think you've been
hanging around these monkeys
for too long.

94
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,300
Did you really think

95
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,600
that you could hide yourself
behind all this magic?

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,300
I mean what good are runes

97
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,300
when you show yourself
by your actions?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,500
It's very sloppy.

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,100
Maybe you're sick
of this realm.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Or maybe you actually feel
remorse for your actions

101
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,100
and you've decided
to turn yourself in.

102
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I have paid for my transgressions.
You've paid?

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,000
Being exiled to this planet
is far from payment

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
for what you did my friend.

105
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,100
Your kind has yet
to be punished.

106
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,900
By whom? You and your
fanatic followers?

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,600
You're not enacting
the will of the Creator.

108
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
You're on your own crusade
to destroy those

109
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,200
whom you know were loved
more by the Creator.

110
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Silence!

111
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,800
Prepare yourself
for your judgment Fallen.

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
Yaah!

113
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,700
Only the Creator can judge.

114
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,700
Wait!

115
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,900
Oh! You fool!

116
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,200
He was hiding something
and you destroyed it!

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,100
Mom let it go.

118
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
There are plenty
of kids out there

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,800
who call their parents
by their first names.

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,700
Besides Dr. Jonas says

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,200
that it's common
for older adopted children

122
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,900
and it doesn't mean

123
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,600
that Aaron's
not bonding with us.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,800
No Mom Tom and I don't
need a second opinion.

125
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
We're happy working
with Dr. Jonas.

126
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,200
Besides Aaron trusts him.

127
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,100
Oh! It's okay Stevie. Sorry.

128
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I-- No it's okay.

129
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
I just touched Stevie
without telling him.

130
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,900
And I think you're wrong

131
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,200
about forcing Aaron
to call us Mom and Dad.

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
You know
he's been through more

133
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,800
than you or I
could ever understand.

134
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,600
Oh here he is now Mom.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,700
Yeah.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,400
She wants to wish you
a Happy Birthday.

137
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey Marge--

138
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,000
Grandma.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,100
A white button-down shirt
slacks and loafers.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay. I will.

142
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,100
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

143
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,200
She wanted to make sure
I was dressed right

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
to meet
the school recruiters.

145
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,300
Oh well I officially
apologize for my mother again.

146
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,400
It's no big deal.
Don't sweat it.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
So you're legal now.

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,000
Are you sure you don't
want to play hooky today?

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
We could go and vote
enlist in the Army

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
or--ooh--you could see
an "R"-rated movie.

151
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,000
No thanks anyway.
I got a big test in math

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,100
and I got to practice
for the meet on Saturday.

153
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,300
Oh. Headache.

154
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,000
You're not doing
any dumb jock stuff

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
like starving yourself
for the wrestling meet?

156
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,300
Uh with my metabolism
I don't have to.

157
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,200
Lucky dog.

158
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,500
Hey bro.
How's it going?

159
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Hey.

160
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,600
You're the only one
that--

161
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,700
- he does that with.
- He does that with.

162
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,100
Well Stevie and I have
an understanding. Right bro?

163
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,600
Oh hey Stevie leave
Aaron's ring alone.

164
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
That's okay.
He can play with it.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey Stevie
I got to get going.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm gonna hand you over
now okay?

167
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey Stevie Mama's gonna
take you from Aaron okay?

168
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,400
Oh no. It's okay.

169
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,600
We got to let Aaron
get to school right?

170
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,100
Yeah we're gonna have
some fun today

171
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,000
aren't we? Hmm?

172
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
Hey no
it's a good thing

173
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,300
that he responds so well
to you right kiddo?

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,900
Yeah. You go to school.
We're fine.

175
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,300
I told you. I don't know what
you're talking about

176
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,700
we know youre master
was part of a system

177
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,700
that protects the fallen angels
and their offspring

178
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,800
where are the records?

179
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,700
She knows nothing.
Dispose of her.

180
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,900
wait wait

181
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
sometimes I woould see hime

182
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,700
he would stand in front of the
markings. on the wall

183
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,100
show me where

184
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,400
here

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,300
He has hidden them
behind the runes.

186
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
You have done well.

187
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,900
We have no more
need of you.

188
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
Very clever Samchial.

189
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
The abominations--we can
track them down and des--

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's that?

191
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
It's North America.

192
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,300
It looks
like Massachusetts.

193
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,700
Damn him!

194
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,000
He rigged it.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
You think?

196
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,800
Samchial's
not alone in this.

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,300
He was expecting
someone else.

198
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,000
Find out who it is

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,100
and let me know
before the others do.

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,700
Corbett-hole.

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,900
Lay off Lockhart.
I got a headache.

202
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,800
You weren't at weigh-in
this morning.

203
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,500
Yeah I got in late.

204
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I was 162.

205
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,300
What are you losing weight?

206
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,500
Better bulk up if you want
to compete in the 166 class.

207
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
No I'm good.
I'm shooting for your level.

208
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,900
I mean I'm good at 166

209
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
but I'm gonna be great
at 157

210
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,700
so you watch your butt
"Corbutt"

211
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,300
'cause I'm coming for you.
I'll eat you alive.

212
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,100
Someone screw
with your locker Brady?

213
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,800
Yeah real funny.

214
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,100
You think they'd get
tired of the same joke.

215
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,100
Here.

216
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,600
For a jock
you're almost human.

217
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,300
And for a geek
you're almost uh...

218
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,500
Ah you're just a geek.

219
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
Why do you put up
with that nose wipe?

220
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,900
Ah leave him alone
Peter.

221
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Just trying
to help you out.

222
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
It's bad enough
you're a foster kid

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
but hanging out
with losers like that

224
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
it's bad for your rep.

225
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,900
Catch my drift Corbett?

226
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
Corbot.

227
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,900
Don't even think it.

228
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,000
That is way
out of your league.

229
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,200
Hey.
Hi.

230
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Ouch. That had
to hurt huh?

231
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,200
I got to get to class.

232
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
Wrestling is
the art of strategy.

233
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,600
Do not think
about your first move.

234
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,500
Think about how you're gonna
get to your fifth move.

235
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,900
Okay mat time.
Situational drills.

236
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,700
Pinning combinations.
Partner up.

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Wrestling is
the art of leaders.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,700
Genghis Khan
chose his generals

239
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,400
by their wrestling skill.

240
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
And at the regionals

241
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,500
we're gonna show everybody
what kind of leaders we are.

242
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,100
Uh Corbett partner up
with Lockhart.

243
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,300
You're gunning
for state champ.

244
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,700
Gotta give you a challenge.

245
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,200
Got what it takes
Corbett-hole?

246
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,300
How's the headache?

247
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,000
Still there.

248
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,700
Good. Make it easier
to take you down.

249
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
Thanks for the love.

250
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,200
Couldn't hold
the half nelson.

251
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,500
Weak Corbett weak.

252
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,200
You're gonna have to do
much better on Saturday.

253
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,100
Mat work.
Pinning combinations.

254
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,800
Partner up.

255
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
Hey Brady.

256
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,800
Saw you in the shower
today buddy.

257
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,500
Doesn't look good.

258
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,100
Yeah shouldn't you be
in the girls' locker room?

259
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,200
Come on Peter
let me go.

260
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
"Come on Peter
let me go."

261
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,900
"Peter oh please
don't hurt me."

262
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,900
Can we be intelligent
about this?

263
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Whoa! You're saying
Peter's not intelligent?

264
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,700
Aren't you guys tired of
kicking the crap out of me?

265
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,600
Not yet.
Lay off Lockhart.

266
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,900
Whoa it's
the orphan boy.

267
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,800
Yeah poster boy here
for birth control.

268
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,000
You challenging Lockhart
after he trounced you today?

269
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,400
Didn't you learn your
lesson in gym today

270
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,800
Corbett-hole.

271
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,500
I guess not.

272
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,200
Aaron
what are you doing?

273
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,900
Lay off Corbett!
You're choking him!

274
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
He's choking him.

275
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,600
Let him loose Corbett!
You're choking him!

276
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,500
Lay off him!

277
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,100
Aaron come on let him go.
He's just a jerk.

278
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,700
Man lay off!
You're choking him!

279
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Come on let him go.

280
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Lay off him!

281
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,000
It's your birthday?

282
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I heard what you did
for David Brady in the gym.

284
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,400
I think it's cool.

285
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,300
It was stupid.
I uh I lost control.

286
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,600
I could have hurt him.

287
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,900
Well it's just
I promised Tom and Lori

288
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,400
that I wouldn't
fight anymore.

289
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,900
Who?

290
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,300
Oh they're my parents.

291
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Oh!

292
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,200
I'm sorry. They're-- Yeah.
They're my parents.

293
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,500
They're-- Actually they're
my adoptive parents.

294
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,300
Yeah. I heard
you're adopted.

295
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,000
So am I.

296
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
You are?
Yeah.

297
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,600
My mom died
when I was born

298
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,500
and my aunt
raised me.

299
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,000
And when she died
I moved up here

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,900
to live with my
other aunt.

301
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,500
Wow.

302
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,200
That's--
That's so cool.

303
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
What?

304
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,000
No no no.
Not that you're an orphan.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
That's not what I meant.
I'm an orphan too.

306
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,900
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,400
I didn't mean it
that way.

308
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,500
It's okay.

309
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,700
It's just
uh you uh--

310
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,800
You know
your biological family.

311
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
You don't?
No.

312
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,700
I was uh placed
in foster care

313
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,400
when I was born.

314
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,300
Sorry.

315
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
What are you gonna do
for your birthday?

316
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,300
You having a big party?

317
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,400
No I'll probably
just uh

318
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,500
hang out
with Tom and Lori

319
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,800
and Stevie.
He's their son.

320
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,100
That probably sounds
really uh dorky

321
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,000
spending my 18th birthday
with my family.

322
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,200
No. It sounds
really wonderful.

323
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,400
Vilma come here.

324
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
I got to go.

325
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Happy birthday.

326
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,900
So water conservation.

327
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,500
Three basic goals:

328
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,600
Increase the amount
of groundwater

329
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,900
keep the unpolluted
waters clean

330
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,800
and clean up
the polluted waters

331
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,200
and decrease our own
personal use.

332
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,700
Americans use 60 gallons
of water each per day.

333
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,900
That's five times more
than any European.

334
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,100
Now when you're
brushing your teeth

335
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,000
do you let
the water run

336
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,900
or do you turn the shower on
before you get into it

337
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,100
let it run getting warm

338
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,500
or run the water
for a while

339
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,900
before you get
a glass of water

340
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,300
wash just a few things
in the laundry machine?

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,100
Okay this material will
be on next week's test.

342
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,100
Homework tonight Chapter 3

343
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,600
and answer the questions
in the back.

344
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,100
Mr. Corbett
before you go

345
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,700
I know you have a--

346
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,900
a lot of offers
from colleges

347
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,600
based upon
your wrestling

348
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
but I don't want you

349
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,900
to neglect your
academic achievements.

350
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,700
I have a friend who's
recruiting for Cornell.

351
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,100
He's looked
at your records.

352
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,500
He's impressed and he
wants to meet with you.

353
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Now I know it may
be as much money

354
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,800
as a sports scholarship

355
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,000
but I think you should
listen to his offer.

356
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,900
Okay. I will.
Thank you Mrs. Baker.

357
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,300
Aaron you're a smart boy.
You're talented.

358
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
Kids like you
they're destined for a fate

359
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,100
greater than being
an ex-wrestling champ.

360
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,400
Make something of yourself.

361
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,300
Can I help you?

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The boy
the one who just left.

363
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Aaron Corbett?

364
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes. Thank you.

365
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,400
Is there a problem?

366
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,800
Not anymore.

367
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,100
He's really mean.

368
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
He's nice to me.

369
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,500
Yeah like a spider
and you're the fly.

370
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,400
Maybe I'm the spider
and he's the fly.

371
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,700
I think he's cute.

372
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,100
Come on class.
Take your seats.

373
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
Open up your textbooks
to Chapter 5.

374
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,800
Run. Disappear.

375
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,100
Run!

376
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,900
They come! Run!

377
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,400
Run! Danger.

378
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,700
Leave this place.

379
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,600
Run.

380
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,200
Danger. Run.

381
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,900
Run!
Run!
Run!

382
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,700
Danger!

383
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,700
Get home...

384
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
get some sleep...

385
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,100
and everything
will be okay.

386
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Ah kids today.

387
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,700
Drink drugs.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
Shouldn't be driving.

389
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,700
Angels?

390
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Nephilim.

391
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,900
Come on
come on come on.

392
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,000
Hey.

393
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,000
Hey you.

394
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,400
Hold it hold it.
Stop stop stop!

395
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,500
Hold it! Now wait a minute

396
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,700
wait a minute
wait a minute!

397
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,300
Oh my.

398
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,600
He's come.

399
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,300
The Punisher.

400
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
what shall we do?
They've come to kill us

401
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,500
don't worry my beloved

402
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,800
I'll proctect you.

403
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,200
They won't find you

404
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,300
But the signs show...

405
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,800
You must come with me

406
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,600
Father no. What are you doing?
No please.

407
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
You have your Nephilim.

408
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,200
I've kept my part
of the bargain.

409
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Please father. No.

410
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
How could you do this?

411
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,900
Then you will live
Grigori.

412
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,700
For now.

413
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,800
Papa?

414
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,900
Papa!

415
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,600
Lori?

416
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Aaron!

417
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,300
Stevie?

418
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,300
Aaron Aaron Aaron.

419
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
Love you love you
love you.

420
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,300
Okay play now with Gabriel?

421
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,900
Aaron scared?
Aaron okay?

422
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,200
I swear if I hear
one more word from you

423
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,400
I'm gonna scream.

424
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,800
Aaron?
Hey you're home early.

425
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,600
Everything all right?

426
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah are you okay?

427
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,600
Yeah yeah I think
I'm just uh...

428
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,000
I think I'm coming
down with something.

429
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Oh you're pale.
Oh and you're feverish.

430
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,300
Yeah I just uh...

431
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,400
I just need to rest.

432
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,300
Are you sure?
Can I make you something?

433
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,000
No no. I'm fine.

434
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,500
I'm just gonna
um go upstairs.

435
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,200
Okay.

436
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,700
Hey wait for Gabriel!

437
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,500
Gabe is not talking to me.

438
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,100
Gabe is not talking to me

439
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,700
Aaron angry at Gabriel?

440
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,700
Gabe is not talking to me

441
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
Gabriel did
something wrong?

442
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,800
Shut up.

443
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Please just shut up.

444
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,400
I'm losing it.

445
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,700
This can't be happening.

446
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,300
Aaron angry.

447
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,700
Gabriel knows why.

448
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,900
It's a...dream.

449
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,500
It's...hallucinations
from a fever.

450
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
Maybe I...hit my head
too hard in gym class.

451
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
Gabriel took chewed up

452
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,700
couldn't stop.

453
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Gabriel sorry.

454
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,500
Aaron please forgive.
Please.

455
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,700
Gabe will never
chew socks.

456
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,600
It's not about
the damn sock.

457
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,400
I know but I promise
I will never chew socks.

458
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,700
Please be quiet
for a second.

459
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,000
Is everything okay up there?

460
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,900
Gabriel fine.
Aaron act funny.

461
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,600
We're good--
I mean I'm good.

462
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Okay.

463
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,800
Inside.

464
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah but I thought maybe
a quick game of fetch.

465
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,900
Animals and people aren't
supposed to talk to each other.

466
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,700
Dogs are dogs
and humans are humans.

467
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,400
Aaron talk to Gabe
all the time.

468
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,500
Gabe talk
to Aaron all the time.

469
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
I know that
but there's a difference

470
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,500
between talking to
and understanding Gabe.

471
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,300
I'm--I'm arguing with a dog.

472
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,700
This is crazy.
I'm--I'm crazy.

473
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,400
They're uh...

474
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,200
They're gonna lock
me away Gabe.

475
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
Aaron scared
Gabriel talk?

476
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,000
Gabriel no talk.

477
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,900
No talk?

478
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,000
No talk.

479
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,100
Okay. Okay.

480
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,900
I'm gonna sleep this off.

481
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,200
When I wake up
everything's gonna be fine.

482
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,900
Yeah and we'll celebrate
your birthday tomorrow.

483
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,800
Okay.

484
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,700
Can't wait.

485
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,500
We're gonna have
cake and ice cream.

486
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,700
It's gonna be
a lot of fun.

487
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,500
Stop talking.

488
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,500
there is no mercy
for abominations!

489
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,600
There is no mercy for Nephilim!
Aah!

490
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,300
Hello.

491
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,800
No more talking?

492
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,100
Okay.

493
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Good boy.

494
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,900
All right buddy
let's get you some food.

495
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,500
Good.
Love love love food.

496
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,100
Oops.

497
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,300
Gabriel talked.

498
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,100
I think
I'm going crazy.

499
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,700
Have you told
Tom and Lori?

500
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,500
No. No. Um...

501
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,100
You know they've been
so nice to me

502
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,000
and uh...

503
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,800
now I've got to tell them
that they've adopted a schizo.

504
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
There are a lot of other
things besides schizophrenia

505
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,900
that would explain
these symptoms.

506
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,800
You and I have been
meeting for seven years.

507
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,700
We've gone through some
pretty tough situations in foster care

508
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:22,000
so I--I think we can get
through this one all right okay?

509
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,500
Good.

510
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,600
All right then.

511
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,000
Reality check.

512
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,600
Out of the Heavens rained down
who angrily were saying:

513
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,600
"Who is this...
that without death goes through
the Kingdom of the people dead"

514
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,500
So what did I just say?

515
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,700
It's from Dante's Inferno.

516
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,300
We read it last year
in Language Arts.

517
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,600
The fallen angels are angry

518
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,200
because Dante's in hell
but he's not dead.

519
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,800
Did you um read
this book in Italian?

520
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
No.

521
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,400
Non conosco l'italiano.

522
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,400
But you're speaking it now.

523
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
No. Ora non sto parl--

524
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,600
parlando.

525
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Holy crap.

526
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,600
D-Do you see
what I mean?

527
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,100
Amazing.

528
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,900
Wait a minute.

529
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,800
..."whose fire in his eyes

530
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,900
"reaches further
than her heart.

531
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,400
"Will the flame
of the heart die

532
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
in the flames
of the fire?"

533
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,900
The woman thinks
of the living

534
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,000
whose fire in his eyes
reaches further
than her heart.

535
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,700
Will the flame
of the heart die

536
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,600
in the flames of the fire?

537
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
Or something like that.

538
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
Hey you live
like an onion

539
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
with your head
in the ground.

540
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
An onion?
What does that mean?

541
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,900
Um...it means...

542
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,700
It means holy crap.

543
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,400
What?

544
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,400
I--I don't know Aaron.
I don't know.

545
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,600
I've heard of people

546
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,200
who have suffered
a head trauma.

547
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,100
Others get brain lesions.

548
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,000
Well I did have
a bad headache.

549
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
And suddenly they--they
understand other languages.

550
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,900
I always just thought
it was urban myth.

551
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,500
Repeat this string
of numbers to me backwards:

552
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
11 5 8 12 14.

553
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,600
14 12 8 5 11.
Adds up to 50.

554
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,100
That's right.

555
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,200
And you understand
animals as well.

556
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,100
So is Gabe
saying anything?

557
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,900
Gabe?

558
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,700
A lady poodle
peed right here.

559
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Um...

560
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,400
A poodle
peed on your carpet.

561
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,800
Well now
that's impossible.

562
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,500
The label said the odor
will be gone in a week

563
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,900
and absolutely no one--

564
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,900
Gabe told you that?

565
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,000
Damn.

566
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,000
Aaron are you...

567
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
having any other symptoms?

568
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,300
I mean are you
experiencing nausea vomiting?

569
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,400
No.

570
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,300
I'm fine.

571
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,500
Just...weird.

572
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,900
Weird.

573
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,000
Yeah well that--

574
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,500
That is the word
for it.

575
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,600
I'm gonna get you in
to see my friend

576
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
at Stanford
Medical Center.

577
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,800
I'm gonna clear
my book tomorrow.

578
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,500
Can you be here
around 10 A.M.?

579
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,400
I want you to use
the emergency line

580
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
if you need anything
or you feel sick all right?

581
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,800
And take notes.
Take notes Aaron.

582
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,900
I want to know everything
that's going on.

583
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,800
And tell your folks.

584
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,200
I mean that's
what parents are for.

585
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,600
Maybe I had a stroke
or something.

586
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Or maybe it's genetic.

587
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,500
My father was a...
genius

588
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,800
or my mother was part
of a medical experiment

589
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,900
and died
while giving birth.

590
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,200
It's hard not knowing
who your parents are.

591
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
You're kind of an orphan
too huh?

592
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,600
Aaron Gabriel's family.

593
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
What the--

594
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,300
Something's coming.

595
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,700
Ah.

596
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,100
Hello young Nephilim

597
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,800
Do you understand the
tongue of the message

598
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,200
The Messenger?

599
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,100
What you are is obvious.
You are in danger...

600
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,300
Nephilim.

601
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,200
Aaron?

602
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,800
Aaron! Wait for Gabriel!

603
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,200
Oh this is not good.

604
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,700
This is not good.

605
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,800
Play now?

606
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,500
Oh. Oh good yeah.

607
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,200
Play now?

608
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
No play.

609
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,600
Must work. No play.

610
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,400
All work no play makes
Aaron talk to himself.

611
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,000
How are you?

612
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
You speak Portuguese?

613
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,100
I didn't know.

614
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,400
No...no...I don't speak Portuguese.

615
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:13,400
Well kind of.
Not really.

616
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,700
Just a little bit.

617
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,300
But your accent is perfect.

618
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,300
Yeah I've-- I've been
studying it some.

619
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,400
It's a pretty language.

620
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
You weren't in class today.

621
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,000
No no I uh--

622
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Some say you didn't want
to go to wrestling

623
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,700
that you're chicken.

624
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,900
Would that "some"
be Peter Lockhart?

625
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,900
Yeah. He's a loser.

626
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,200
I thought you were sick
but here you are

627
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,500
talking to yourself.

628
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,000
Oh I was uh
I was talking to Gabe.

629
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Oh hi poochie.
Not Poochie Gabriel.

630
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,400
What a pretty dog.

631
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
Yeah Gabriel very pretty.

632
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
Uh...

633
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,900
Oh uh
I'm doing research

634
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,000
for uh for school.

635
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,300
It's a book report.

636
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,200
I love angels.

637
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
Uh...

638
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,000
See?

639
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,100
Um I have all kinds
of books on them.

640
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,100
Do you know
about um Nephilim?

641
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
Sure yeah. There's all
kinds of angels.

642
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,200
There's the Cherubim
the Seraphim

643
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,100
the Nephilim
who were the children

644
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,400
of an angel and a human.

645
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,700
You see they had
the powers of angels

646
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,500
but the souls of man.

647
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,900
Here let me
show you a site.

648
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,500
"From the root 'nephel'

649
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,600
"meaning 'unnaturally
begotten men' or 'bastards.'

650
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,600
"They are the biblical
half-breeds:

651
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
half-human half-angel."

652
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Isn't this site great?

653
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,600
Yeah yeah this is--
This is really cool.

654
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,400
I think angels are here
all around us.

655
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,500
What you mean like
you can see 'em?

656
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,400
Well not see 'em but...

657
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,500
don't you ever feel

658
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,500
like you're in the presence
of something special?

659
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,100
Yeah.

660
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,600
I--I know
what you mean.

661
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,200
When's your
book report due?

662
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Maybe I can help
with research.

663
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,300
Wow. Yeah.
That would be--

664
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
That would be fantastic
yeah.

665
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,900
Um I got to get the bus.

666
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,600
Uh we both have study hall
second period tomorrow.

667
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,900
You want to meet
at the library?

668
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Sure I'd love to.
Yeah.

669
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,100
"Nephilim had the gift
of tongues

670
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
"understanding all languages

671
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:58,300
including that of the animals
and the plants."

672
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,400
We got to find that bum.

673
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,500
He's right over there.

674
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,300
Hey! Hey!

675
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,400
Ohh...

676
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
Hey you come here
come here come here.

677
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,000
Listen to me. Why did you
call me that name?

678
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't want
to hurt you.

679
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,100
I'm not gonna let go of you

680
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,700
until you tell me
what's going on okay?

681
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,800
Okay.

682
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,000
Go easy with the threads.

683
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,200
Huh?

684
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,900
It's my best outfit.

685
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:31,800
Why did you call me
Nephilim?

686
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,700
'Cause that's what you are.

687
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,000
You're half-angel
half-human.

688
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,800
You some sort of cult
person is that it?

689
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,900
I'm an angel.

690
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,500
Name is Ezekiel
Zeke for short.

691
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,100
Okay okay I got it.

692
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,400
I'm talking
to a nut case.

693
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,000
Well ha ha--

694
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
You're crazier than me.

695
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Have it your way.
Come on Gabe.

696
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,000
Well Happy 18th Birthday
to you nonetheless.

697
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,800
Yep.

698
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,900
How did you know
it was my birthday?

699
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,500
Nephilim come of age
when they're 18

700
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,600
and you can smell 'em
a mile away

701
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,300
when they're turning.

702
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,300
Ahh...

703
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,900
And boy you do
smell of angel.

704
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
This is a bunch of bull.

705
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,300
Well you're taking it
a lot better than most.

706
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,900
What do you mean?

707
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,600
Well angel nature
and human nature

708
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,400
don't live well
together.

709
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,200
Nephilim when they
experience both

710
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,300
they hmmm
they go wackadoodle

711
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,900
and you you're just
a little wonka-wonka.

712
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,300
Huh wonka-wonka--hoo.
Wonka-wonka. Wonka.

713
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,300
I have done your bidding.

714
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,800
I have sought out
the abominations

715
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
and destroyed them.

716
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,900
But it has been a long time
since I have heard your words

717
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,100
a sign that my work
is pleasing in your sight.

718
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,600
I know it is not
for me to ask

719
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,000
but...a sign.

720
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,400
if you could just show me--

721
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,200
Your lordship.

722
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,100
What?

723
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,200
Your lordship I thought
you might want these:

724
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,300
the remains of Samshial.

725
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,500
What would I want
with his ashes?

726
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,400
Do you think
I'm like these humans

727
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,100
needing their remains
to make themselves feel better?

728
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,900
Huh!

729
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,400
Wait!

730
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,600
A sign.

731
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,100
Thank you.

732
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,400
You have done well.

733
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,100
For this you may have
the next kill.

734
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,200
Thank you my lord.

735
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,500
We must send Kolazonta
to Massachusetts

736
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,700
to find someone named Corbett.

737
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,900
If you're an angel
show me your wings.

738
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,500
I'm a Grigori

739
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,900
one of the highest
orders of angels.

740
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,000
I uh hate to break it
to you bud

741
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,900
but uh those
aren't wings.

742
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,300
Uh yeah I had 'em
clipped in the fall.

743
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,400
Oh yeah?

744
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,500
So they'll grow back
in the spring?

745
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,800
Uh that's fall
not as in autumn

746
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,700
uh as in fallen.

747
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,300
I'm a fallen angel
so they clipped my wings.

748
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,500
Those scars you got
they could be from anything:

749
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,600
an accident surgery.

750
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah well
believe it or not

751
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,600
I am an angel.

752
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,900
Heh heh heh.

753
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,300
You are Nephilim

754
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
which means that
uh--ha ha--

755
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,100
I want to be
out of here

756
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,900
when they come
looking for you.

757
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,900
Who's "they"?

758
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,900
The Powers.
They uh their gig is

759
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,500
to get rid of creatures
they're not pleased with

760
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,500
and uh usually
they find 'em

761
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,000
within two days
after their 18th birthday.

762
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,100
Now you've got
maybe a day

763
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,900
something like that
I think yeah.

764
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,000
So you're telling me that
because I'm a Nephilim

765
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,900
God has sent killer
angels after me.

766
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,000
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

767
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,100
God God
is such a limiting term.

768
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:50,000
The Creator
is so much more:

769
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,200
Allah Shiva
the Tao Jehovah--

770
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,700
Can you please
stick to the point?

771
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,800
The point.
Oh yes well

772
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,200
uh humans and angels
are not supposed to uh

773
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,000
canoodle uh fraternize
socialize that sort of thing.

774
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Well anyway...

775
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,200
the result
of our dalliances...

776
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,500
are beings like you
Nephilim.

777
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,300
That's it here we go.
Aha! My prize yes.

778
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,100
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah here we go.

779
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,800
Play ball!
Yes! Play ball!

780
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,200
No no no no no no.
This is not to play with.

781
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,500
This is mine. I caught this
is straightaway center field

782
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,000
from Babe Ruth
and it's signed by him.

783
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Wait wait wait wait.
You can hear my dog?

784
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,800
Oh yes I can hear
your dog absolutely.

785
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,600
That's what talking
in tongues is.

786
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,100
It's an angel thing.

787
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,400
And we're really good
dancers too--woo-hoo!

788
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,500
Uh the Powers think

789
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,500
that they are the Creator's
personal storm troopers

790
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,200
and their whole goal
is to get rid of Nephilim

791
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,600
and they absolutely
hate the Fallen.

792
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,100
Why? Why do they
hate the Fallen?

793
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,100
The important thing is that
Camael leader of the Powers

794
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,900
is here and he's probably
looking for you.

795
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,800
What is that?

796
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,300
Wait a minute.
That's my name.

797
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,600
This is just a bruise.
That ain't no bruise.

798
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
That's a mark.
That's ancient writing.

799
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,500
This is getting weird!
I wanna get--

800
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:26,400
That--That's uh--
That's ancient writing.

801
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,800
That's uh--
I'm out of here.

802
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,700
Wait wait!

803
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,000
Whoa-ho-ho!

804
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,100
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

805
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,400
So you tell me some Camel
guy's looking for me?

806
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,700
Whoa! Hold it!

807
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,300
Gabe! Ball!
Gabe! No!

808
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,400
Ball! Oh yeah!
Play ball!

809
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,500
Gabe.

810
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,400
He came out of nowhere.
I didn't even--

811
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,400
Just get help quick.

812
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,600
Gabe you okay?

813
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,900
Gabriel hurt bad.

814
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,000
Gabe no. Gabe
no no no no no.

815
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,900
Please please
Gabe Gabe Gabe Gabe.

816
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:05,600
Gabe.

817
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,900
Aaron?

818
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,900
All right all right.
Move aside move aside.

819
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,100
Let me show you
how a real angel heals.

820
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,300
Come on move aside.

821
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,800
All right.

822
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,000
Easy boy.
Easy big fella.

823
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,800
I'm gonna take you
for a little ride.

824
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,500
There you are.

825
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,900
It...hurts.

826
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,700
What is that?
What's happening?

827
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,500
Did you see that?

828
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,400
That's his soul
leaving the body.

829
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,900
Whoo. That means
I lost my touch.

830
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,200
Sorry kid. You know
what they say:

831
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,000
use it or lose it.

832
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,200
No. No no no no
no no no.

833
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,000
There's got to be
something.

834
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,300
No. No no no no no.

835
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:05,700
Please.

836
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,900
That's something you're not
supposed to be able to do

837
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,400
unless--

838
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
Now look here now if you
are what I think you are

839
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,100
then we can--we can
still save this dog.

840
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,600
Please you've done
enough damage.

841
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,100
Look you either believe me
and he lives

842
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,300
or you don't
and he dies.

843
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,000
Now it's your choice.

844
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
You put your hands on him.

845
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,300
Animal Control's
on their way.

846
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,900
Now.

847
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,500
This is crazy.

848
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,000
You got to tap into
your angel nature.

849
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,800
It's like everything's
speeding up inside ya.

850
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,100
See it in the darkness.
Look hard.

851
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,000
You see it?

852
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,400
You see it.

853
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,000
I see something.

854
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,400
Hear it. Call to it.
Let it fill you.

855
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:08,600
What is it?

856
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,900
No no no.
You got to control it.

857
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,800
You got to control it.
You got to--

858
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,100
If you're gonna
save this dog

859
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,100
you've got to accept
your angel nature.

860
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,700
You've got to open
yourself to it.

861
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:20,900
You've got
to let it fill you.

862
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:23,400
You've got to accept it
as part of you

863
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,200
and if you doubt it
if you question it

864
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
it'll destroy you
or you will destroy it.

865
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,400
You understand?

866
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,100
Okay.

867
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,500
This is a part of me.

868
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,000
This is a part of who I am.

869
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,500
Aaron?

870
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,200
Where's the ball?

871
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Gabe.

872
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,200
Hey hey hey hey.

873
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,300
Oh I'm free at last.

874
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,700
Where's the ball?
Where'd the ball go?

875
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,100
I'm free at last!

876
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,900
This is impossible.

877
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,700
I'm not half an angel.

878
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,800
Oh sorry to tell you kid

879
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,300
but you're probably
more than that.

880
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,900
Ah!

881
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,700
He bears the names
of the Fallen

882
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,100
he has the touch
of the angels.

883
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,500
No more exile.

884
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,800
Gabe stay away
from the birds.

885
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,900
Don't worry Aaron.
Gabriel won't hurtrt.

886
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,500
Honing hunting skills.

887
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,400
Honing? Who uses words
like "honing"?

888
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,900
I don't even
words like "honing."

889
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,400
So if you are
what I think you are

890
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,600
we've got some business
to tend to.

891
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,400
No we don't.

892
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,700
We have no business
to attend to okay?

893
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,500
My dog almost died.

894
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,200
There you are.

895
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,700
And I just brought him
back to life.

896
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,400
Exact--
That's crazy.
That's insane.

897
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,000
I got to talk to Jonas.

898
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,100
No no no no no no.

899
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,300
Go easy with this.
You're quite a find.

900
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,400
No I'm not.
Yes you are.

901
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
Whatever just happened's
never gonna happen again.

902
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,500
Great! I can help you!
I can make it all go away.

903
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,500
Yes I can. There's just
one little thing
you have to do for me:

904
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:14,400
Redeem me.
What?

905
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,600
You can restore me
to an angel

906
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,000
and send me home.

907
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,400
Then I can call off
the Powers

908
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,900
and you can be
a normal boy again.

909
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,400
Okay I'm--
I'm out of here.

910
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,000
Oh no no no
no no no.

911
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,400
Listen. Listen to me.
Just stay here.

912
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
Just listen to me please.
Just listen for a moment.

913
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,300
Now there is a chance
that you can redeem me

914
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,800
and clear me
of my transgressions.

915
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,200
How can I redeem you?

916
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,600
I don't know
what that means.

917
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,800
I don't know
if you're real.

918
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,600
You know I'm real.
Come over here.

919
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,000
Let me give you
something here.

920
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,500
Babe Ruth signed this.
It's yours. Here.

921
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,100
It's not about the payment.
Do you understand?

922
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,700
This is just--This is--
This is too weird.

923
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,000
All right all right
all right.

924
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,600
The prophesy
said you would come

925
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,000
and here you are

926
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,300
so all I'm asking you to do
is to redeem me.

927
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:10,600
Just uh touch me
to wave your hands over me

928
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,100
have redeeming thoughts.

929
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,600
I don't even know

930
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,800
Please just do it
do it

931
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,300
and I won't ask you
anything more.

932
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,600
Just--I promise.

933
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,300
All right fine.

934
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,600
You're--You're saved.
You're redeemed. Whatever.

935
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,500
That's it?

936
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,700
No. See? You got
the wrong guy.

937
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,300
Oh no no no.
Please try again.

938
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,700
Try like you did
with the dog.

939
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,700
Look what you did with the dog.
Huh?

940
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,100
Come on.

941
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,500
Are you satisfied?

942
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,900
All right go on
go on damn it.

943
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,100
Just go on.
Don't redeem me.

944
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,200
Let me give you
a little advice Mister!

945
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
You better get
your butt out of here

946
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,900
because if the Powers
find you

947
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,100
your ass is grass
you understand that?

948
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,300
I'm getting out of here.
I've had enough of you.

949
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,700
Super sauce comin' at ya.

950
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,200
Hey! Happy Birthday!

951
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,600
Hey Happy
Belated Birthday!

952
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,500
Ready for some of that
special spaghetti sauce?

953
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,700
Aaron?

954
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,800
It's okay.

955
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,600
Hey is everything okay?

956
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,700
What's wrong?

957
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,500
Aaron?

958
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,400
What's wrong?

959
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,900
You can tell us.

960
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,400
Um I just um...

961
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,400
Thank you.

962
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,000
Thank you for--
for everything.

963
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,400
I just want you guys
to know

964
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
that I can never repay you.

965
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,300
Repay us?
Buddy we're family.

966
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,400
We don't repay.

967
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,100
Hey
we love you.

968
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,700
I love you too
Mom and Dad.

969
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,600
Please don't
forget that.

970
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,000
Um don't worry.
We won't.

971
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,600
Come on let's eat.

972
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,500
Oh my God.
Look what he's doing.

973
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:21,100
Stevie did you
do that sweetie?

974
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,300
Angel.

975
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,600
Oh my God
you're speaking!

976
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,200
Stevie
you're talking!

977
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,900
Hey!

978
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:28,800
Hey hi Stevie!

979
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:29,600
Hi sweetheart.

980
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,800
Where's
the video camera?

981
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,000
Uh...
We got to get this
on tape.

982
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,600
Go go go go.
Baby it's me Mommy.

983
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,900
Hey can you say "Mommy"?

984
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,900
Aaron.

985
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,500
He's--
Stevie's speaking.

986
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,300
Hey can you say
something for me?

987
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,800
Aaron.

988
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,500
Angels.

989
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,600
Angels come.

990
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,000
He knows who
you are Aaron.

991
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
This is amazing.
He knows who you are.

992
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,900
I think I'll call in
sick tomorrow

993
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,600
and come with you
and Stevie to the clinic.

994
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,900
What if he's
getting better?

995
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,200
What if this
is all a mistake?

996
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Take it easy.
One step at a time.

997
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:30,800
Yeah.

998
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,200
You missed weigh-in
this morning.

999
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,200
Hmm?

1000
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,400
Coach Chaney called.

1001
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,800
Tell her what
Dr. Jonas said.

1002
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,400
I uh was doing
a report for school.

1003
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
Dr. Jonas said that you
should tell Tom and--

1004
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,300
Oh cake!

1005
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,500
That's good. Can't make it
on brawn alone.

1006
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,000
I got to get
this one to bed.

1007
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,600
I'm gonna uh go
get some fresh air.

1008
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh there we go.
You're a big boy.

1009
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,700
The Studebaker parts
finally came.

1010
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,200
Water's stuck
in the pit again.

1011
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,200
Oh yeah. We're gonna
have to get that fixed
one of these days.

1012
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,100
Here you go.

1013
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,100
Quite a day huh?

1014
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,500
I mean with uh Stevie

1015
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,000
and plus it being
your birthday.

1016
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,500
Yeah.

1017
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,100
You know Stevie talking...

1018
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:02,200
We've been hoping
for something like that
for...years.

1019
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:02,800
Yeah I know.

1020
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:13,200
Well Lori and I uh--
your mom and I--

1021
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,900
Look I remember
turning 18.

1022
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,900
I was still in foster care

1023
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:20,700
and I waited my whole life
for that birthday

1024
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,800
so I could get out
on my own

1025
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,700
and stop bouncing
from place to place.

1026
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,800
Look just because
you've turned 18

1027
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,500
and legally
you're an adult

1028
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,800
that doesn't mean
we're not family.

1029
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,600
Tom--

1030
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,900
Uh Dad

1031
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,800
there's stuff going on.

1032
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,700
I'm really scared.

1033
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,400
I think there's
something wrong with me.

1034
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,600
I mean um...

1035
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,700
I'm afraid my parents
weren't normal.

1036
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,900
Aaron you and I have talked
about how I was at your age.

1037
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,900
You know
I stole and I lied

1038
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,300
and I got kicked out
of every foster home

1039
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,700
within a few months.

1040
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,600
I know but--

1041
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,400
Wait wait.
It's because I thought

1042
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,900
my biological parents
were bad people.

1043
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,000
And I thought I was bad

1044
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,600
you know like I didn't
have a choice.

1045
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,700
I was--I was a victim
of my own fear.

1046
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,500
You understand
what I'm saying?

1047
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:22,300
Yeah but--

1048
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,800
But then I started to see

1049
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,900
that I was taking
the easy way:

1050
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,400
you know blaming others
for how my life was going.

1051
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,900
But the only person
in charge of my life was me

1052
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,300
and I had a choice.

1053
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,100
You know I could be
angry and resentful

1054
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,100
or I could work

1055
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,500
and create a life
that I could be proud of.

1056
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,500
But I think there's
something wrong with me.

1057
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:50,000
Aaron there's nothing
wrong with you.

1058
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,700
You're human
like all of us.

1059
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,900
You're a good kid.

1060
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,200
I mean
you're a good man.

1061
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,700
You have refused to let
what happened to you

1062
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,500
define who you are.

1063
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,100
I'm proud to have you
as my son.

1064
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Come here.

1065
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,100
Hello.

1066
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,800
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1067
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,900
I'm looking
for someone.

1068
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,600
Well
I'm the only one here.

1069
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,500
How did you get in here?

1070
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,700
A boy. Just turned 18.

1071
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,300
An orphan.

1072
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,800
He has...abilities.

1073
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,300
I think you'd better leave.
There's no one here.

1074
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,300
It's the damnedest thing.

1075
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,100
I haven't seen
anything like it

1076
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,000
not in my entire life.

1077
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,500
You know
I never believed

1078
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,300
in spontaneous human
combustion before

1079
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,100
but there's
no other explanation.

1080
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,900
The guy was completely
incinerated.

1081
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,800
Just him and the phone.

1082
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,500
Fire doesn't work that way.

1083
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,800
It's the damnedest thing.

1084
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,300
Excuse me.

1085
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,200
The doctor who works here
is he okay?

1086
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,800
You family?

1087
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,400
He's my friend.

1088
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,400
I'm sorry kid. I can't
say anything officially.

1089
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,300
We see Dr. Jonas?

1090
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,500
No.

1091
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:38,900
We don't.

1092
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,300
This is so screwed up.

1093
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,900
Who's gonna
believe me huh?

1094
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,200
All right I'll be
right back okay?

1095
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,600
Brady have you seen
Vilma Rodriguez?

1096
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,500
You mean the girl you've
been pining over all year?

1097
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,300
If you see her tell her
I can't make study hall.

1098
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,000
Here let me.

1099
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,900
Geez Corbett you ripped
the whole door off.

1100
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,900
What's with you?

1101
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,300
Hey Corbett-hole surprised
to see you at school.

1102
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,900
You been hiding or what?

1103
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,300
Not now Lockhart.

1104
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,200
Find Vilma
and tell her I'll
talk to her later.

1105
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,300
Don't turn
your back on me.

1106
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,600
I'm just gonna get
the vice-principal.

1107
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,500
No. Brady you intervene
and you're next.

1108
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,000
Peter don't do this
okay?

1109
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,600
You're dead.

1110
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,600
You're a freak Corbett.

1111
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:09,800
How did you do that?

1112
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,300
Honestly I--

1113
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:16,900
I have no clue man.

1114
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,000
Things
are really screwed up.

1115
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,100
I can't even...

1116
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,000
begin to explain.

1117
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:24,700
Aaron.

1118
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,200
There you are.

1119
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,700
Hi.
Hi.

1120
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,600
Um listen I got to cancel
our study date.

1121
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,900
I know. I figured you were
already in there.

1122
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,300
What? In where?

1123
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,700
In the counselor's office.
They were looking for you.

1124
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,300
There's a guy here
from Cornell.

1125
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:43,000
Oh no no no.
Now is not a good time.

1126
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,300
Don't be silly.
You'll be fine.

1127
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:45,600
Just be yourself.

1128
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,500
New York can you imagine?
That is so cool.

1129
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,100
I want to hear what happens
with the interview.

1130
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,700
I'm gonna be by the cafe
around 4 P.M.

1131
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:54,900
You can tell me
all about it.

1132
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:30,800
Tree.

1133
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Bird.

1134
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:33,900
"Significant improvement."

1135
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,200
That's what he said.

1136
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,700
I'll get out of work
and go with you.

1137
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,300
I'd like to check out
this new doctor.

1138
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,300
Aaron! Help Aaron!

1139
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,300
Oh! Hey Stevie
you're okay.

1140
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,800
If you're gonna
kill me...

1141
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:54,200
just do it.

1142
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:04,500
What are you waiting for?

1143
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,700
Just do it.

1144
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,300
Kill me.

1145
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,100
Kill you?

1146
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,600
I've been looking for you
for centuries.

1147
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,000
I'm here to protect you.

1148
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:23,200
There was a great battle.

1149
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,400
A mighty angel
convinced many followers

1150
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,900
to rebel against the teachings
of the Creator.

1151
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,100
Although these rebels
were strong

1152
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,000
they did not win their fight.

1153
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,900
They were banished
to the Earth.

1154
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,800
Their wings were clipped.

1155
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:36,700
The Fallen.

1156
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,800
You killed them.

1157
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,300
In the past.

1158
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,900
I thought it was
my holy mission

1159
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:46,700
to eradicate the Fallen
and their offspring.

1160
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,000
You've eradicated
others like me?

1161
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:49,900
Yes I have.

1162
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Then why are you
so set on saving me?

1163
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,200
I mean aren't I one
of your abominations?

1164
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,400
A prophet once said
that a Nephilim would be born

1165
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,300
who could forgive the Fallen
of their sins

1166
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,800
so that they may
return to the Source.

1167
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,100
I saw that the Creator
had a plan

1168
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,700
much greater
than I could comprehend.

1169
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,100
After that I could no longer
be a part of the killing

1170
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,700
and I realized
that I had to save those

1171
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,000
the Powers
wished to destroy.

1172
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,700
This is ridiculous.

1173
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,700
What are you
like part

1174
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:24,900
of the Angelic Witness
Protection Agency or something?

1175
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,300
I don't understand.

1176
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,900
So basically
I'm screwed.

1177
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:30,800
I either go into hiding

1178
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,100
or I'm killed
by fanatic angels.

1179
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,300
That's--That's great.

1180
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:37,000
There is another thing.
I don't want to hear it.

1181
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,900
We have studied the signs
foretold by the prophet.

1182
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,200
A child would be born
when the Sun was in Virgo.

1183
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,700
The footprint of the father
would mark his birthplace

1184
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,200
and he would be called
as a Messenger.

1185
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,300
Get toto the point.

1186
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,200
These signs
have led us to you.

1187
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,500
It is possible

1188
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,400
that you are the one that
I have been searching for.

1189
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,600
Okay well I hate
to break your bubble

1190
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,900
but I'm not okay?

1191
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,200
Zeke fed me that whole
redeeming line too and--

1192
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,900
You've met Ezekiel?

1193
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,500
Yeah. I tried the whole
redeeming thing on him

1194
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,500
and it didn't work.
I'm not your guy.

1195
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,200
So why don't you
leave me alone okay?

1196
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,800
Ezekiel is not
to be trusted.

1197
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,500
According to Zeke
neither are you.

1198
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,100
If Ezekiel knows
that you're here

1199
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,500
he will tell the Powers.

1200
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,900
Whether you are
the Redeemer or not

1201
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,300
your life
is in grave danger.

1202
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:26,100
I can protect you.
I can hide you.

1203
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,300
There's no way.
They've killed
your friend Dr. Jonas.

1204
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,100
Stop it.

1205
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,500
They have killed
my friend Samchial.

1206
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,600
They will kill your family.
They will kill you.

1207
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,500
Stop it.

1208
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:36,300
Look I've been
kicked around

1209
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,500
since I was a baby

1210
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,000
one foster home
to another.

1211
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,300
and all I ever wanted
was a normal life.

1212
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,800
And now I'm graduating
high school

1213
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,200
and colleges
are interested in me

1214
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,700
and I have a family
that loves me

1215
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,700
and you know there's
this girl I just met--

1216
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,700
And all this angel stuff
I--I just--

1217
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:54,000
I can't take it.

1218
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,900
I don't want
any part of it.

1219
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,500
You have no choice.

1220
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:01,400
I have no choice?

1221
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,900
Screw you.
I have a choice

1222
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,800
and I'm choosing
to be rid of you

1223
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,000
and all this angel crap

1224
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,100
so why don't you go
back to Heaven

1225
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,600
and leave me
the hell alone?

1226
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:14,200
As you wish.

1227
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,700
Ezekiel my old friend

1228
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,200
and always as-- fragrant as ever.

1229
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,400
I thought I'd
stop by and say "hi"

1230
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:38,600
talk over old times.

1231
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,800
Oh by the way

1232
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,800
have you seen any Nephilim
in these parts?

1233
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,900
Oh-ho-ho...

1234
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,800
They must have passed
right on by.

1235
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,800
Sorry.

1236
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,500
Come on Ezekiel.

1237
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,500
We have always had
such a good arrangement.

1238
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,400
Mutually beneficial
wouldn't you say?

1239
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,800
You tell us
where the Nephilim are

1240
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,700
and we let you live.

1241
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:05,000
Ohh...

1242
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,400
I...know nothing.

1243
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,000
Oh that's funny

1244
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
because his scent
is all over the place.

1245
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,700
And I find it
very interesting

1246
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,600
that you gave up
your own child

1247
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,400
but this one
you protect.

1248
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,000
I haven't seen him.

1249
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:23,700
Hmm...

1250
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,000
I haven't seen him.

1251
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:28,600
Hmm.

1252
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:30,900
I...

1253
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,400
Non s'il vous plaît!

1254
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,100
Nephilim.

1255
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,700
Papa! Papa!

1256
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Aaah!

1257
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,200
It's him or it's you.

1258
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Ohh...

1259
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,400
I'll tell Tom and Lori.

1260
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,200
They'll think I'm crazy
but I have to.

1261
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:54,900
Aaron look out!

1262
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:56,900
Oh-ho-ho. Whoa!

1263
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,600
What's wrong with you?

1264
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,200
Uh look I'm uh--

1265
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,200
Stupid idiot!

1266
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,000
Yeah well
nevertheless

1267
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,700
uh the Powers
are looking for you

1268
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:12,700
and I had to uh well
tell 'em where you live so--

1269
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:16,600
You sent killer angels
to my house?

1270
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,800
What about my family?

1271
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,200
That's a good point
That's a good point.

1272
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:20,900
Now if you're lucky

1273
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,800
Verchiel will spend time
questioning and...

1274
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:26,400
killing 'em--
nicely I'm sure--

1275
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,800
and then you'll have time to escape.
What?

1276
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,200
Yes. Well they're
not your family anyway.

1277
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,300
I love them.
Oh that's sweet.

1278
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,400
I'm sure they appreciate it
but you better run right now.

1279
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,400
I'm not gonna run.
I'm not a coward like you.

1280
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,700
Courage
is vastly overrated.

1281
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:44,100
Why are you doing this?

1282
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,700
I am not
your precious Redeemer.

1283
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,800
I'm doing this
to help you out.

1284
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,000
Now just run.
You disgust me.

1285
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,300
I'd rather love and die
than live and hate myself.

1286
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,000
Oh that's beautiful.

1287
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,800
If it's me they want
it's me they'll get.

1288
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:58,300
I'm not gonna let them
hurt my family.

1289
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,600
come on ?

1290
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,800
Wait a minute. Wait!

1291
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:01,900
Hey hold on just a second.

1292
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,500
Now what about--

1293
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:05,300
What about me?

1294
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:14,800
Lori?

1295
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,600
Tom?

1296
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,000
Aaron we get out of here.

1297
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,300
Lori! Tom!

1298
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,800
Aaron what's going on?

1299
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,500
What is this slamming?
What is going on?

1300
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,500
Listen! Go back
into the basement!

1301
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,000
Angels! Angels! Angels!
Lock the door!

1302
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,200
Don't come out
no matter what you hear.

1303
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:41,000
But Aaron--

1304
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,300
Just do this for me
please.

1305
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,100
okay okay

1306
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:47,900
Wait.

1307
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,200
Just go.
Just go please.

1308
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:53,800
Okay.

1309
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,800
Protect them.
Don't let them get hurt.

1310
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,700
Come Nephilim!

1311
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,700
Gabriel protect.

1312
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,500
Aaron's fine.

1313
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:07,600
It's okay.

1314
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:22,100
Come Nephilim!

1315
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:28,000
Meet your death!

1316
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,500
Kid go back!

1317
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,400
Run for it!
Go now!

1318
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,900
You want a piece of me?
You got it!

1319
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:40,800
Grrr!

1320
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,400
Aah!

1321
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,900
Kushiel kill Ezekiel!

1322
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:17,200
Leave him alone.

1323
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:19,400
It's me you want.

1324
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:20,900
Yes it is!

1325
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:24,300
Look I don't want
anything to do

1326
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,700
with angels or prophesies.

1327
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,500
So just leave me
and my family alone

1328
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,600
and we won't bother you.
I promise.

1329
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh you promise!

1330
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,200
Ha ha ha!
The abomination bargains!

1331
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,200
How amusing!

1332
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,500
He's yours.

1333
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,600
Must save Aaron.

1334
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,400
Raah!

1335
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,500
Traitor!

1336
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,800
You deserve to die!

1337
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,400
He is the Redeemer.

1338
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,000
The Redeemer?
You can't be serious!

1339
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,900
Ha! Ha! Haah!

1340
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:19,000
Aah!

1341
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:26,700
Peniel!

1342
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
Raah!

1343
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,800
Aah! Aah! Aahr!

1344
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,900
Go. Go get a weapon.

1345
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,900
How?

1346
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:45,000
See it in your mind.

1347
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:49,900
Your turn.

1348
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,500
Raah! Ha! Ha! Aah!

1349
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,400
Aahhh...

1350
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:12,800
Ooohh...

1351
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,400
Aaarh!

1352
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:29,800
Aarh! Aah! Aah!

1353
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:33,700
Aargh!

1354
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:37,500
Raah! Aah!

1355
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,400
Aah!

1356
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:10,100
Mama's gonna
touch you baby.

1357
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,100
There we go.

1358
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,500
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1359
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:26,300
Aah!

1360
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,100
Stop! You can't
kill the Redeemer!

1361
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,300
He's part of the Creator's
divine plan!

1362
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,900
Him? You're not
just a traitor

1363
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,100
you're also a fool.

1364
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,400
Look at him! Has anyone
ever fought back before?

1365
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:17,100
Can't you feel
his presence?

1366
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:18,900
Tell me this
isn't different.

1367
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,700
You almost had me.

1368
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:27,500
No!

1369
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,200
Oh!

1370
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,900
Oh my God! Aaron!

1371
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:50,400
Aaron! Angel!
Aaron! Angel!

1372
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,900
Aaron!

1373
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,000
Aaron! Angel!

1374
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,600
Aaron! Aaron!

1375
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,500
So much for your prophesy.

1376
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,100
What have you done?

1377
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,400
Aaron!

1378
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,300
Angel! Aaron!

1379
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,200
Aaron! Trapped!

1380
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,800
Open up!

1381
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,000
Aaron!

1382
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,600
Aaron!
We're trapped!

1383
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,700
Aaron!

1384
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,500
Uh...

1385
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,100
Thank you.

1386
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,000
I misjudged you.

1387
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,600
I was waiting for a sign.

1388
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,300
I--I understand now.

1389
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:17,600
Fine. You go ahead
and you get rid of me

1390
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,700
but that is not gonna
solve your problem.

1391
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,800
The Powers will never
let you roam this planet.

1392
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,400
They will hunt you down.

1393
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,700
And you will have to leave.

1394
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:29,600
Your family will never
be safe with you here.

1395
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,900
Aaron!

1396
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:37,600
Aaron look out!

1397
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,500
Agrrr!

1398
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,800
He stood you up.

1399
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,400
Something
could have happened.

1400
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,600
I'll give him
ten more minutes.

1401
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,700
It's almost 5.

1402
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,500
I'll wait for him
a little longer.

1403
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,000
Zeke.

1404
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,800
You came back.
You surprised me.

1405
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,800
Yeah...

1406
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,400
I surprised myself.

1407
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,700
Oh no. Don't touch me.

1408
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,500
If you use your powers
it's like a beacon.

1409
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:31,800
They may send someone
back to look for you.

1410
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,100
It is true.

1411
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:37,800
But don't they
already know?

1412
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,600
If you forsake your powers

1413
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,000
you can save the life
you have here.

1414
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,400
If not you will become
what you were born to be:

1415
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:46,500
the Redeemer.

1416
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,200
Zeke.

1417
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,100
I want the truth.

1418
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,200
Do you regret letting others
die so you could live?

1419
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,200
Yes.

1420
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,200
So would I.

1421
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:52,300
Hey.

1422
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,900
Open up! Aaron!

1423
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Come back!

1424
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,300
I'm going away now.

1425
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,300
No.

1426
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,400
But I'll always
be with you okay?

1427
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:07,800
Aaron.

1428
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,100
Aaron! Angel.

1429
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,900
Aaron!

1430
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:14,500
Here.

1431
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:21,600
Aaron. Angel.

1432
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,300
Aaron! The longer you stay

1433
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,500
the greater the danger.

1434
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,400
I'll come back.

1435
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,400
I promise.

1436
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Gabe? Gabe?

1437
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,700
Can you hear me?
Come here boy.

1438
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,300
Tell Mom and Dad
that I love them okay?

1439
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,000
Lori!

1440
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:15,700
Lori.

1441
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,200
Hey hey it's Aaron.

1442
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:25,100
There's something horrible
that's happening.

1443
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,900
What is going on?
Where's Aaron?

1444
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,700
I don't know--

1445
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,000
Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!

1446
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,500
Aaron!

1447
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,500
Hey.

1448
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,100
It has been said
they walk among us...

1449
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:40,200
that they guide us.

1450
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:42,900
It could be the banker...

1451
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:45,800
the girl next door...

1452
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,300
or the cop on the beat.

1453
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,900
But I know now
that some tempt us.

1454
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,800
They even destroy
what we believe in.

1455
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,400
My future is not my own.

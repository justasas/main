1
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:04,288
When God created man,
a jealous Lucifer

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:06,088
mounted a great
rebellion in heaven.

3
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:08,288
His army of angels
was defeated

4
00:00:08,288 --> 00:00:10,188
and forever banished
from paradise.

5
00:00:10,788 --> 00:00:14,188
These angels, the fallen,
abandoned Lucifer,

6
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:16,788
choosing to live on earth
among the pleasures of humans.

7
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:20,588
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

8
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:23,788
children called Nephilim:
by the power of angels

9
00:00:23,788 --> 00:00:24,888
with the souls of man.

10
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:27,988
Angry, the Creator
flooded the earth,

11
00:00:28,288 --> 00:00:30,688
killing the Nephilim and driving
the fallen into hiding.

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,388
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

13
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,288
to hunt those who
survived the flood.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,788
but there was hope
for the fallenn a prophecy.

15
00:00:40,288 --> 00:00:42,088
A Nephilim would be born
who would redeem them

16
00:00:42,088 --> 00:00:43,888
and return them
to paradise.

17
00:00:44,888 --> 00:00:47,788
So the fallen watched...
and waited.

18
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:13,288
Tom?

19
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:14,988
Lori?

20
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:27,188
Tom? Lori?

21
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:34,388
Come, Nephilim!

22
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,788
Meet your death!

23
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:51,988
Huh.

24
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:55,988
Oh, man, that was wicked.

25
00:01:59,588 --> 00:02:00,488
Oh...

26
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,488
Hey, buddy.

27
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,088
Oh, hey, hey,
stop, come on.

28
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:05,688
All right, come on, come on.

29
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,788
Hey, a little lighter
on the noise, okay?

30
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:11,988
I got
a killer headache.

31
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:13,988
Surprise.

32
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:15,688
Hey,
Happy Birthday!

33
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:16,788
Happy Birthday!

34
00:02:16,788 --> 00:02:18,288
Don't let it go out.
I got it.

35
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:19,588
Okay.
We got it.

36
00:02:20,688 --> 00:02:22,488
Here it is.
There you go.
Make a wish.

37
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,488
Yay.
Nice.

38
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:29,288
Thank you, Lori.
Thanks, Tom.

39
00:02:29,888 --> 00:02:32,388
Wow. Um, you guys
didn't have to do this.

40
00:02:32,388 --> 00:02:34,788
Didn't have to?
It's your 18th birthday.

41
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,888
It's like the start
of a whole new life.

42
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,088
Yeah. And we'll
have a party tonight,

43
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:42,088
but we just wanted
to, uh, to--

44
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:45,888
how happy we are
that you were born,

45
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:48,488
that last three years
you've been with us

46
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:50,788
have been just wonderful.

47
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:51,388
Yeah.

48
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:53,488
Thank you.

49
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,488
I mean, yeah.
Thanks a lot.

50
00:02:58,288 --> 00:03:00,288
Now, you know
the Corbett tradition.

51
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,888
Birthday boy gets
to pick dinner,

52
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,788
so what'll it be?

53
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:06,388
Um, well, if it's
not too much trouble,

54
00:03:06,388 --> 00:03:08,688
maybe Tom can make
his spaghetti sauce?

55
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:11,288
Yeah. Yeah?

56
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:13,588
Of course not.
It's no trouble.

57
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:15,288
I'll make it
extra-special.

58
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:16,788
It already is, hon.

59
00:03:18,288 --> 00:03:19,788
Okay. All right.

60
00:03:19,788 --> 00:03:22,088
Well, um, I got to get
to work, so...

61
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,588
we'll see you,
and save your appetite.

62
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:27,188
Maybe after the party,
we can work on the Caddy.

63
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:28,388
Cool.
All right.

64
00:03:29,488 --> 00:03:32,788
That was very nice of you,
and brave.

65
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:35,388
I can talk him out of it.

66
00:03:35,388 --> 00:03:37,288
I'll tell him we're
out of the ingredients.

67
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,588
No, no, I'm actually, uh...

68
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,088
I'm beginning to like
Tom's sauce.

69
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,388
Or at least
get used to it.

70
00:03:47,688 --> 00:03:49,388
How'd you get to be
such a good kid, huh?

71
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:52,688
I got to get Stevie up.

72
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:55,088
So enjoy your breakfast,

73
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,788
and happy birthday.

74
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,788
How's it taste?

75
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:23,088
this just arrived

76
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:24,488
he said it wa urgent

77
00:04:27,588 --> 00:04:29,288
it's late You may go now

78
00:04:29,288 --> 00:04:30,788
But you have another meeting

79
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,088
it's no t neccessary for you to be here

80
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:34,988
I'll see you tomorrow

81
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:36,488
what was that

82
00:04:36,488 --> 00:04:37,388
just the wind

83
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:38,688
we're on the eighty-first floor

84
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:43,888
Hello, Fallen.

85
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,488
Verchiel.

86
00:04:46,488 --> 00:04:48,088
You look like you were
expecting someone.

87
00:04:50,188 --> 00:04:52,088
Who was coming
to visit you, Samchial?

88
00:04:52,288 --> 00:04:53,588
No one, Your Worship.

89
00:04:55,488 --> 00:04:57,688
Look we find you,

90
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:58,588
lying to us.

91
00:05:00,888 --> 00:05:02,488
What's that in your hair?

92
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:03,488
Is it gray?

93
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:07,188
I think you've been
hanging around these monkeys
for too long.

94
00:05:09,488 --> 00:05:10,388
Did you really think

95
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,688
that you could hide yourself
behind all this magic?

96
00:05:13,488 --> 00:05:15,388
I mean, what good are runes

97
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,388
when you show yourself
by your actions?

98
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,588
It's very sloppy.

99
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:27,188
Maybe you're sick
of this realm.

100
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:34,288
Or maybe you actually feel
remorse for your actions,

101
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:37,188
and you've decided
to turn yourself in.

102
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:40,188
I have paid for my transgressions.
You've paid?

103
00:05:41,188 --> 00:05:44,088
Being exiled to this planet
is far from payment

104
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:45,588
for what you did, my friend.

105
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,188
Your kind has yet
to be punished.

106
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:52,988
By whom? You and your
fanatic followers?

107
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,688
You're not enacting
the will of the Creator.

108
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,688
You're on your own crusade
to destroy those

109
00:05:57,688 --> 00:05:59,288
whom you know were loved
more by the Creator.

110
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:00,188
Silence!

111
00:06:03,588 --> 00:06:05,888
Prepare yourself
for your judgment, Fallen.

112
00:06:12,888 --> 00:06:13,888
Yaah!

113
00:06:18,888 --> 00:06:20,788
Only the Creator can judge.

114
00:06:57,988 --> 00:06:58,788
Wait!

115
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,988
Oh! You fool!

116
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:11,288
He was hiding something,
and you destroyed it!

117
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:17,188
Mom, let it go.

118
00:07:17,288 --> 00:07:18,988
There are plenty
of kids out there

119
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,888
who call their parents
by their first names.

120
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,788
Besides, Dr. Jonas says

121
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:25,288
that it's common
for older adopted children,

122
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:26,988
and it doesn't mean

123
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,688
that Aaron's
not bonding with us.

124
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:32,888
No, Mom, Tom and I don't
need a second opinion.

125
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,488
We're happy working
with Dr. Jonas.

126
00:07:36,888 --> 00:07:39,288
Besides, Aaron trusts him.

127
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:42,188
Oh! It's okay, Stevie. Sorry.

128
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,488
I-- No, it's okay.

129
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,488
I just touched Stevie
without telling him.

130
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,988
And I think you're wrong

131
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:51,288
about forcing Aaron
to call us Mom and Dad.

132
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,588
You know,
he's been through more

133
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:55,888
than you or I
could ever understand.

134
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,688
Oh, here he is now, Mom.

135
00:07:59,088 --> 00:07:59,788
Yeah.

136
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,488
She wants to wish you
a Happy Birthday.

137
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:04,088
Hey, Marge--

138
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:06,088
Grandma.

139
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:14,188
A white button-down shirt,
slacks, and loafers.

140
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:18,488
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

141
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,288
Okay. I will.

142
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,188
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

143
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,288
She wanted to make sure
I was dressed right

144
00:08:27,288 --> 00:08:29,488
to meet
the school recruiters.

145
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:32,388
Oh, well, I officially
apologize for my mother again.

146
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,488
It's no big deal.
Don't sweat it.

147
00:08:35,488 --> 00:08:37,488
So, you're legal now.

148
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,088
Are you sure you don't
want to play hooky today?

149
00:08:39,088 --> 00:08:43,088
We could go and vote,
enlist in the Army,

150
00:08:43,088 --> 00:08:45,288
or--ooh--you could see
an "R"-rated movie.

151
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:49,088
No, thanks anyway.
I got a big test in math,

152
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:51,188
and I got to practice
for the meet on Saturday.

153
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:54,388
Oh. Headache.

154
00:08:55,288 --> 00:08:57,088
You're not doing
any dumb jock stuff

155
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:59,088
like starving yourself
for the wrestling meet?

156
00:08:59,588 --> 00:09:01,388
Uh, with my metabolism,
I don't have to.

157
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:03,288
Lucky dog.

158
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:07,588
Hey, bro.
How's it going?

159
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:09,788
Hey.

160
00:09:12,488 --> 00:09:13,688
You're the only one
that--

161
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,788
- he does that with.
- He does that with.

162
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,188
Well, Stevie and I have
an understanding. Right, bro?

163
00:09:20,888 --> 00:09:22,688
Oh, hey, Stevie, leave
Aaron's ring alone.

164
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,888
That's okay.
He can play with it.

165
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,088
Hey, Stevie,
I got to get going.

166
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,288
I'm gonna hand you over
now, okay?

167
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:31,088
Hey, Stevie, Mama's gonna
take you from Aaron, okay?

168
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,488
Oh, no. It's okay.

169
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:35,688
We got to let Aaron
get to school, right?

170
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:37,188
Yeah, we're gonna have
some fun today,

171
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:39,088
aren't we? Hmm?

172
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,488
Hey, no,
it's a good thing

173
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,388
that he responds so well
to you, right, kiddo?

174
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,988
Yeah. You go to school.
We're fine.

175
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:57,388
I told you. I don't know what
you're talking about

176
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,788
we know youre master
was part of a system

177
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,788
that protects the fallen angels
and their offspring

178
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,888
where are the records?

179
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:08,788
She knows nothing.
Dispose of her.

180
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:10,988
wait wait

181
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:14,688
sometimes I woould see hime

182
00:10:14,688 --> 00:10:18,788
he would stand in front of the
markings. on the wall

183
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,188
show me where

184
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,488
here

185
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,388
He has hidden them
behind the runes.

186
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:39,288
You have done well.

187
00:10:40,688 --> 00:10:41,988
We have no more
need of you.

188
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,188
Very clever, Samchial.

189
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:03,388
The abominations--we can
track them down and des--

190
00:11:05,088 --> 00:11:06,088
What's that?

191
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,788
It's North America.

192
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:11,388
It looks
like Massachusetts.

193
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:14,788
Damn him!

194
00:11:14,788 --> 00:11:16,088
He rigged it.

195
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:16,988
You think?

196
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,888
Samchial's
not alone in this.

197
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:24,388
He was expecting
someone else.

198
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:27,088
Find out who it is,

199
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,188
and let me know
before the others do.

200
00:11:38,888 --> 00:11:39,788
Corbett-hole.

201
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:41,988
Lay off, Lockhart.
I got a headache.

202
00:11:42,288 --> 00:11:43,888
You weren't at weigh-in
this morning.

203
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,588
Yeah, I got in late.

204
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:46,588
I was 162.

205
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:49,388
What, are you losing weight?

206
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,588
Better bulk up if you want
to compete in the 166 class.

207
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:54,688
No, I'm good.
I'm shooting for your level.

208
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,988
I mean, I'm good at 166,

209
00:11:56,988 --> 00:11:58,988
but I'm gonna be great
at 157,

210
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:00,788
so you watch your butt,
"Corbutt,"

211
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:03,388
'cause I'm coming for you.
I'll eat you alive.

212
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,188
Someone screw
with your locker, Brady?

213
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,888
Yeah, real funny.

214
00:12:06,888 --> 00:12:09,188
You think they'd get
tired of the same joke.

215
00:12:13,288 --> 00:12:14,188
Here.

216
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:26,688
For a jock,
you're almost human.

217
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:30,388
And for a geek,
you're almost, uh...

218
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:32,588
Ah, you're just a geek.

219
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:41,888
Why do you put up
with that nose wipe?

220
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,988
Ah, leave him alone,
Peter.

221
00:12:43,988 --> 00:12:45,588
Just trying
to help you out.

222
00:12:45,588 --> 00:12:47,088
It's bad enough
you're a foster kid,

223
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,488
but hanging out
with losers like that,

224
00:12:48,488 --> 00:12:49,888
it's bad for your rep.

225
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:50,988
Catch my drift, Corbett?

226
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:53,088
Corbot.

227
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,988
Don't even think it.

228
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,088
That is way
out of your league.

229
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,288
Hey.
Hi.

230
00:13:12,888 --> 00:13:15,288
Ouch. That had
to hurt, huh?

231
00:13:16,188 --> 00:13:17,288
I got to get to class.

232
00:13:20,488 --> 00:13:22,888
Wrestling is
the art of strategy.

233
00:13:23,588 --> 00:13:25,688
Do not think
about your first move.

234
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,588
Think about how you're gonna
get to your fifth move.

235
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,988
Okay, mat time.
Situational drills.

236
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:34,788
Pinning combinations.
Partner up.

237
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:38,088
Wrestling is
the art of leaders.

238
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:39,788
Genghis Khan
chose his generals

239
00:13:39,788 --> 00:13:41,488
by their wrestling skill.

240
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,488
And at the regionals,

241
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,588
we're gonna show everybody
what kind of leaders we are.

242
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:48,188
Uh, Corbett, partner up
with Lockhart.

243
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:49,388
You're gunning
for state champ.

244
00:13:49,388 --> 00:13:50,788
Gotta give you a challenge.

245
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,288
Got what it takes,
Corbett-hole?

246
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:53,388
How's the headache?

247
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,088
Still there.

248
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:56,788
Good. Make it easier
to take you down.

249
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:57,788
Thanks for the love.

250
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,288
Couldn't hold
the half nelson.

251
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:23,588
Weak, Corbett, weak.

252
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:25,288
You're gonna have to do
much better on Saturday.

253
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:30,188
Mat work.
Pinning combinations.

254
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:30,888
Partner up.

255
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,897
Hey, Brady.

256
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:43,597
Saw you in the shower
today, buddy.

257
00:14:43,597 --> 00:14:44,297
Doesn't look good.

258
00:14:44,297 --> 00:14:46,897
Yeah, shouldn't you be
in the girls' locker room?

259
00:14:46,897 --> 00:14:47,997
Come on, Peter,
let me go.

260
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:49,497
"Come on, Peter,
let me go."

261
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,697
"Peter, oh, please,
don't hurt me."

262
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:53,697
Can we be intelligent
about this?

263
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:56,597
Whoa! You're saying
Peter's not intelligent?

264
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:59,497
Aren't you guys tired of
kicking the crap out of me?

265
00:14:59,497 --> 00:15:02,397
Not yet.
Lay off, Lockhart.

266
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,697
Whoa, it's
the orphan boy.

267
00:15:04,697 --> 00:15:07,597
Yeah, poster boy here
for birth control.

268
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:09,797
You challenging Lockhart
after he trounced you today?

269
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:13,197
Didn't you learn your
lesson in gym today,

270
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:14,597
Corbett-hole.

271
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,297
I guess not.

272
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:23,997
Aaron,
what are you doing?

273
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,697
Lay off, Corbett!
You're choking him!

274
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:26,697
He's choking him.

275
00:15:26,697 --> 00:15:28,397
Let him loose, Corbett!
You're choking him!

276
00:15:28,397 --> 00:15:29,297
Lay off him!

277
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,897
Aaron, come on, let him go.
He's just a jerk.

278
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,497
Man, lay off!
You're choking him!

279
00:15:34,497 --> 00:15:36,097
Come on, let him go.

280
00:15:36,097 --> 00:15:37,097
Lay off him!

281
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:20,797
It's your birthday?

282
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,797
Yeah. Yeah.

283
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:28,597
I heard what you did
for David Brady in the gym.

284
00:16:29,297 --> 00:16:31,197
I think it's cool.

285
00:16:31,197 --> 00:16:34,097
It was stupid.
I, uh, I lost control.

286
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:35,397
I could have hurt him.

287
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,697
Well, it's just
I promised Tom and Lori

288
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,197
that I wouldn't
fight anymore.

289
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:42,697
Who?

290
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,097
Oh, they're my parents.

291
00:16:44,097 --> 00:16:45,097
Oh!

292
00:16:45,097 --> 00:16:46,997
I'm sorry. They're-- Yeah.
They're my parents.

293
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:49,297
They're-- Actually, they're
my adoptive parents.

294
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:52,097
Yeah. I heard
you're adopted.

295
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:52,797
So am I.

296
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,997
You are?
Yeah.

297
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,397
My mom died
when I was born,

298
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:00,297
and my aunt
raised me.

299
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:01,797
And when she died,
I moved up here

300
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,697
to live with my
other aunt.

301
00:17:05,397 --> 00:17:07,297
Wow.

302
00:17:07,297 --> 00:17:09,997
That's--
That's so cool.

303
00:17:09,997 --> 00:17:11,197
What?

304
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,797
No, no, no.
Not that you're an orphan.

305
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:15,297
That's not what I meant.
I'm an orphan too.

306
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:16,697
I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.

307
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:18,197
I didn't mean it
that way.

308
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:19,297
It's okay.

309
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,497
It's just,
uh, you, uh--

310
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:23,597
You know
your biological family.

311
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,997
You don't?
No.

312
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:28,497
I was, uh, placed
in foster care

313
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:29,197
when I was born.

314
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:31,097
Sorry.

315
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:38,197
What are you gonna do
for your birthday?

316
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:41,097
You having a big party?

317
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,197
No, I'll probably
just, uh,

318
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,297
hang out
with Tom and Lori,

319
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:47,597
and Stevie.
He's their son.

320
00:17:47,597 --> 00:17:49,897
That probably sounds
really, uh, dorky,

321
00:17:49,897 --> 00:17:52,797
spending my 18th birthday
with my family.

322
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,997
No. It sounds
really wonderful.

323
00:17:58,997 --> 00:18:01,197
Vilma, come here.

324
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:02,197
I got to go.

325
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:05,397
Happy birthday.

326
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:11,697
So, water conservation.

327
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:13,297
Three basic goals:

328
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,397
Increase the amount
of groundwater,

329
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,697
keep the unpolluted
waters clean

330
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,597
and clean up
the polluted waters,

331
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:21,997
and decrease our own
personal use.

332
00:18:21,997 --> 00:18:25,497
Americans use 60 gallons
of water each per day.

333
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,697
That's five times more
than any European.

334
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:30,897
Now, when you're
brushing your teeth,

335
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:31,797
do you let
the water run,

336
00:18:31,797 --> 00:18:34,697
or do you turn the shower on
before you get into it,

337
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,897
let it run, getting warm,

338
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:39,297
or run the water
for a while

339
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,697
before you get
a glass of water,

340
00:18:40,697 --> 00:18:43,097
wash just a few things
in the laundry machine?

341
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,897
Okay, this material will
be on next week's test.

342
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:49,897
Homework tonight, Chapter 3,

343
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,397
and answer the questions
in the back.

344
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,897
Mr. Corbett,
before you go,

345
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,497
I know you have a--

346
00:18:58,497 --> 00:19:00,697
a lot of offers
from colleges,

347
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,397
based upon
your wrestling,

348
00:19:02,397 --> 00:19:03,597
but I don't want you

349
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,697
to neglect your
academic achievements.

350
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:07,497
I have a friend who's
recruiting for Cornell.

351
00:19:07,497 --> 00:19:09,897
He's looked
at your records.

352
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:12,297
He's impressed, and he
wants to meet with you.

353
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,297
Now, I know it may
be as much money

354
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:15,597
as a sports scholarship,

355
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:17,797
but I think you should
listen to his offer.

356
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:20,697
Okay. I will.
Thank you, Mrs. Baker.

357
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:25,097
Aaron, you're a smart boy.
You're talented.

358
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,097
Kids like you,
they're destined for a fate

359
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,897
greater than being
an ex-wrestling champ.

360
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:31,197
Make something of yourself.

361
00:19:44,397 --> 00:19:45,097
Can I help you?

362
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:48,797
The boy,
the one who just left.

363
00:19:49,597 --> 00:19:50,597
Aaron Corbett?

364
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,597
Yes. Thank you.

365
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:54,197
Is there a problem?

366
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:55,597
Not anymore.

367
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,897
He's really mean.

368
00:20:41,597 --> 00:20:42,597
He's nice to me.

369
00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:45,297
Yeah, like a spider,
and you're the fly.

370
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,197
Maybe I'm the spider,
and he's the fly.

371
00:20:49,197 --> 00:20:50,497
I think he's cute.

372
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:10,897
Come on, class.
Take your seats.

373
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:13,197
Open up your textbooks
to Chapter 5.

374
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:14,597
Run. Disappear.

375
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:17,897
Run!

376
00:21:20,397 --> 00:21:21,697
They come! Run!

377
00:21:22,397 --> 00:21:24,197
Run! Danger.

378
00:21:24,197 --> 00:21:25,497
Leave this place.

379
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:26,397
Run.

380
00:21:27,597 --> 00:21:28,997
Danger. Run.

381
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,697
Run!
Run!
Run!

382
00:21:31,697 --> 00:21:32,497
Danger!

383
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,497
Get home...

384
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:38,497
get some sleep...

385
00:21:39,697 --> 00:21:40,897
and everything
will be okay.

386
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:48,697
Ah, kids today.

387
00:21:49,297 --> 00:21:50,497
Drink, drugs.

388
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:52,997
Shouldn't be driving.

389
00:22:06,397 --> 00:22:07,497
Angels?

390
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:22,697
Nephilim.

391
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:24,697
Come on,
come on, come on.

392
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,797
Hey.

393
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:33,797
Hey, you.

394
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,197
Hold, it, hold it.
Stop, stop, stop!

395
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:36,297
Hold it! Now wait a minute,

396
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:37,497
wait a minute,
wait a minute!

397
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:39,097
Oh, my.

398
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:50,397
He's come.

399
00:22:53,197 --> 00:22:54,097
The Punisher.

400
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:01,997
what shall we do?
They've come to kill us

401
00:23:01,997 --> 00:23:04,297
don't worry my beloved

402
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,597
I'll proctect you.

403
00:23:07,497 --> 00:23:08,997
They won't find you

404
00:23:08,997 --> 00:23:11,097
But the signs show...

405
00:23:12,497 --> 00:23:13,597
You must come with me

406
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:18,397
Father, no. What are you doing?
No please.

407
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,597
You have your Nephilim.

408
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:20,997
I've kept my part
of the bargain.

409
00:23:20,997 --> 00:23:22,397
Please, father. No.

410
00:23:22,997 --> 00:23:23,997
How could you do this?

411
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:25,697
Then you will live,
Grigori.

412
00:23:26,697 --> 00:23:27,497
For now.

413
00:23:29,797 --> 00:23:31,597
Papa?

414
00:23:31,597 --> 00:23:32,697
Papa!

415
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:25,800
Lori?

416
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Aaron!

417
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,500
Stevie?

418
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron.

419
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,100
Love you, love you,
love you.

420
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
Okay, play now with Gabriel?

421
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Aaron scared?
Aaron okay?

422
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,400
I swear, if I hear
one more word from you,

423
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,600
I'm gonna scream.

424
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,000
Aaron?
Hey, you're home early.

425
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,800
Everything all right?

426
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,100
Yeah, are you okay?

427
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,800
Yeah, yeah, I think
I'm just, uh...

428
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
I think I'm coming
down with something.

429
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh, you're pale.
Oh, and you're feverish.

430
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,500
Yeah, I just, uh...

431
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,600
I just need to rest.

432
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,500
Are you sure?
Can I make you something?

433
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,200
No, no. I'm fine.

434
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,700
I'm just gonna,
um, go upstairs.

435
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,400
Okay.

436
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,900
Hey, wait for Gabriel!

437
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,700
Gabe is not talking to me.

438
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,300
Gabe is not talking to me

439
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,900
Aaron angry at Gabriel?

440
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Gabe is not talking to me

441
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,900
Gabriel did
something wrong?

442
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,000
Shut up.

443
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Please, just shut up.

444
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,600
I'm losing it.

445
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,900
This can't be happening.

446
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,500
Aaron angry.

447
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,900
Gabriel knows why.

448
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,100
It's a...dream.

449
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:44,700
It's...hallucinations
from a fever.

450
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,700
Maybe I...hit my head
too hard in gym class.

451
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,200
Gabriel took, chewed up

452
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,900
couldn't stop.

453
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Gabriel sorry.

454
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,700
Aaron, please forgive.
Please.

455
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,900
Gabe will never
chew socks.

456
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,800
It's not about
the damn sock.

457
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,600
I know, but I promise
I will never chew socks.

458
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,900
Please be quiet
for a second.

459
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,200
Is everything okay up there?

460
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,100
Gabriel fine.
Aaron act funny.

461
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,800
We're good--
I mean, I'm good.

462
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,600
Okay.

463
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,000
Inside.

464
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,400
Yeah, but I thought maybe
a quick game of fetch.

465
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,100
Animals and people aren't
supposed to talk to each other.

466
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,900
Dogs are dogs,
and humans are humans.

467
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,600
Aaron talk to Gabe
all the time.

468
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,700
Gabe talk
to Aaron all the time.

469
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,500
I know that,
but there's a difference

470
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,700
between talking to
and understanding, Gabe.

471
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:44,500
I'm--I'm arguing with a dog.

472
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,900
This is crazy.
I'm--I'm crazy.

473
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,600
They're, uh...

474
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,400
They're gonna lock
me away, Gabe.

475
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,400
Aaron scared
Gabriel talk?

476
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,200
Gabriel no talk.

477
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,100
No talk?

478
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,200
No talk.

479
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,300
Okay. Okay.

480
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,100
I'm gonna sleep this off.

481
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,400
When I wake up,
everything's gonna be fine.

482
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,100
Yeah, and we'll celebrate
your birthday tomorrow.

483
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,000
Okay.

484
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,900
Can't wait.

485
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,700
We're gonna have
cake and ice cream.

486
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,900
It's gonna be
a lot of fun.

487
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,700
Stop talking.

488
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,700
there is no mercy
for abominations!

489
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,800
There is no mercy for Nephilim!
Aah!

490
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,500
Hello.

491
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,000
No more talking?

492
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,300
Okay.

493
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,800
Good boy.

494
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,100
All right, buddy,
let's get you some food.

495
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,700
Good.
Love, love, love food.

496
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Oops.

497
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,500
Gabriel talked.

498
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,300
I think
I'm going crazy.

499
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,900
Have you told
Tom and Lori?

500
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,700
No. No. Um...

501
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,300
You know, they've been
so nice to me,

502
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,200
and, uh...

503
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,000
now I've got to tell them
that they've adopted a schizo.

504
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
There are a lot of other
things besides schizophrenia

505
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,100
that would explain
these symptoms.

506
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,000
You and I have been
meeting for seven years.

507
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,900
We've gone through some
pretty tough situations in foster care,

508
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,200
so I--I think we can get
through this one all right, okay?

509
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Good.

510
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,800
All right, then.

511
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,200
Reality check.

512
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Out of the Heavens rained down,
who angrily were saying:

513
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,800
"Who is this...
that without death goes through
the Kingdom of the people, dead"

514
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,700
So what did I just say?

515
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,900
It's from Dante's Inferno.

516
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,500
We read it last year
in Language Arts.

517
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,800
The fallen angels are angry

518
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,400
because Dante's in hell
but he's not dead.

519
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,000
Did you, um, read
this book in Italian?

520
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
No.

521
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Non conosco l'italiano.

522
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,600
But you're speaking it now.

523
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,600
No. Ora non sto parl--

524
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,800
parlando.

525
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Holy crap.

526
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,800
D-Do you see
what I mean?

527
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,300
Amazing.

528
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,100
Wait a minute.

529
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,000
..."whose fire in his eyes

530
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,100
"reaches further
than her heart.

531
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,600
"Will the flame
of the heart die

532
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
in the flames
of the fire?"

533
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,100
The woman thinks
of the living,

534
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,200
whose fire in his eyes
reaches further
than her heart.

535
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,900
Will the flame
of the heart die

536
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,800
in the flames of the fire?

537
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Or something like that.

538
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,000
Hey, you live
like an onion,

539
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
with your head
in the ground.

540
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
An onion?
What does that mean?

541
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,100
Um...it means...

542
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,900
It means holy crap.

543
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,600
What?

544
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,600
I--I don't know, Aaron.
I don't know.

545
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,800
I've heard of people

546
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,400
who have suffered
a head trauma.

547
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,300
Others get brain lesions.

548
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,200
Well, I did have
a bad headache.

549
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,200
And suddenly, they--they
understand other languages.

550
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,100
I always just thought
it was urban myth.

551
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,700
Repeat this string
of numbers to me backwards:

552
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,500
11, 5, 8, 12, 14.

553
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,800
14, 12, 8, 5, 11.
Adds up to 50.

554
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,300
That's right.

555
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,400
And you understand
animals as well.

556
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,300
So, is Gabe
saying anything?

557
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,100
Gabe?

558
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
A lady poodle
peed right here.

559
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,000
Um...

560
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,600
A poodle
peed on your carpet.

561
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, now,
that's impossible.

562
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,700
The label said the odor
will be gone in a week,

563
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,100
and absolutely no one--

564
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,100
Gabe told you that?

565
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Damn.

566
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,200
Aaron, are you...

567
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
having any other symptoms?

568
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,500
I mean, are you
experiencing nausea, vomiting?

569
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,600
No.

570
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,500
I'm fine.

571
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,700
Just...weird.

572
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,100
Weird.

573
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,200
Yeah, well, that--

574
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,700
That is the word
for it.

575
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm gonna get you in
to see my friend

576
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
at Stanford
Medical Center.

577
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm gonna clear
my book tomorrow.

578
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,700
Can you be here
around 10 A.M.?

579
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,600
I want you to use
the emergency line

580
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,600
if you need anything,
or you feel sick, all right?

581
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,000
And take notes.
Take notes, Aaron.

582
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,100
I want to know everything
that's going on.

583
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,000
And tell your folks.

584
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,400
I mean, that's
what parents are for.

585
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,800
Maybe I had a stroke
or something.

586
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,200
Or maybe it's genetic.

587
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,700
My father was a...
genius,

588
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,000
or my mother was part
of a medical experiment,

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,100
and died
while giving birth.

590
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,400
It's hard not knowing
who your parents are.

591
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,400
You're kind of an orphan
too, huh?

592
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,800
Aaron Gabriel's family.

593
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
What the--

594
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,500
Something's coming.

595
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
Ah.

596
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,300
Hello young Nephilim

597
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,000
Do you understand the
tongue of the message

598
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,400
The Messenger?

599
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
What you are is obvious.
You are in danger...

600
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,500
Nephilim.

601
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,400
Aaron?

602
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,000
Aaron! Wait for Gabriel!

603
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,400
Oh, this is not good.

604
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,900
This is not good.

605
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:31,986
Play now?

606
00:34:33,486 --> 00:34:34,686
Oh. Oh, good, yeah.

607
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:50,386
Play now?

608
00:34:50,986 --> 00:34:51,986
No play.

609
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:54,786
Must work. No play.

610
00:34:55,786 --> 00:34:58,586
All work, no play, makes
Aaron talk to himself.

611
00:34:58,986 --> 00:35:01,186
How are you?

612
00:35:01,186 --> 00:35:02,886
You speak Portuguese?

613
00:35:02,886 --> 00:35:04,286
I didn't know.

614
00:35:04,286 --> 00:35:06,586
No...no...I don't speak Portuguese.

615
00:35:07,286 --> 00:35:12,586
Well, kind of.
Not really.

616
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:13,886
Just a little bit.

617
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:15,486
But your accent is perfect.

618
00:35:15,486 --> 00:35:18,486
Yeah, I've-- I've been
studying it some.

619
00:35:18,486 --> 00:35:21,586
It's a pretty language.

620
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,986
You weren't in class today.

621
00:35:22,986 --> 00:35:24,186
No, no, I, uh--

622
00:35:24,186 --> 00:35:27,186
Some say you didn't want
to go to wrestling,

623
00:35:27,186 --> 00:35:28,886
that you're chicken.

624
00:35:28,886 --> 00:35:31,086
Would that "some"
be Peter Lockhart?

625
00:35:31,086 --> 00:35:33,086
Yeah. He's a loser.

626
00:35:33,086 --> 00:35:36,386
I thought you were sick,
but here you are,

627
00:35:36,986 --> 00:35:38,686
talking to yourself.

628
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:41,186
Oh, I was, uh,
I was talking to Gabe.

629
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,386
Oh, hi, poochie.
Not Poochie, Gabriel.

630
00:35:44,386 --> 00:35:45,586
What a pretty dog.

631
00:35:45,586 --> 00:35:47,186
Yeah, Gabriel very pretty.

632
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,586
Uh...

633
00:35:50,586 --> 00:35:53,086
Oh, uh,
I'm doing research

634
00:35:53,886 --> 00:35:55,186
for, uh, for school.

635
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:56,486
It's a book report.

636
00:35:56,486 --> 00:35:58,386
I love angels.

637
00:35:58,386 --> 00:35:59,386
Uh...

638
00:36:01,486 --> 00:36:02,186
See?

639
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:10,286
Um, I have all kinds
of books on them.

640
00:36:11,986 --> 00:36:14,286
Do you know
about, um, Nephilim?

641
00:36:15,186 --> 00:36:17,586
Sure, yeah. There's all
kinds of angels.

642
00:36:17,586 --> 00:36:20,386
There's the Cherubim,
the Seraphim,

643
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,286
the Nephilim,
who were the children

644
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:23,586
of an angel and a human.

645
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:25,886
You see, they had
the powers of angels,

646
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:28,686
but the souls of man.

647
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,086
Here, let me
show you a site.

648
00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:36,686
"From the root 'nephel,'

649
00:36:36,686 --> 00:36:38,786
"meaning 'unnaturally
begotten men,' or 'bastards.'

650
00:36:38,786 --> 00:36:40,786
"They are the biblical
half-breeds:

651
00:36:40,786 --> 00:36:42,186
half-human, half-angel."

652
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:46,986
Isn't this site great?

653
00:36:48,486 --> 00:36:51,786
Yeah, yeah, this is--
This is really cool.

654
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:55,586
I think angels are here,
all around us.

655
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:59,686
What, you mean, like,
you can see 'em?

656
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,586
Well, not see 'em, but...

657
00:37:03,686 --> 00:37:04,686
don't you ever feel

658
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:07,686
like you're in the presence
of something special?

659
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:08,286
Yeah.

660
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:12,786
I--I know
what you mean.

661
00:37:12,786 --> 00:37:14,386
When's your
book report due?

662
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:16,386
Maybe I can help
with research.

663
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:18,486
Wow. Yeah.
That would be--

664
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,486
That would be fantastic,
yeah.

665
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:23,086
Um, I got to get the bus.

666
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:25,786
Uh, we both have study hall
second period tomorrow.

667
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,086
You want to meet
at the library?

668
00:37:27,086 --> 00:37:29,086
Sure, I'd love to.
Yeah.

669
00:37:39,486 --> 00:37:41,286
"Nephilim had the gift
of tongues,

670
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:43,786
"understanding all languages,

671
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:57,486
including that of the animals
and the plants."

672
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:58,586
We got to find that bum.

673
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,686
He's right over there.

674
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:04,486
Hey! Hey!

675
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:05,586
Ohh...

676
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:08,386
Hey, you, come here,
come here, come here.

677
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,186
Listen to me. Why did you
call me that name?

678
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:14,186
I don't want
to hurt you.

679
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:15,286
I'm not gonna let go of you

680
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:16,886
until you tell me
what's going on, okay?

681
00:38:18,486 --> 00:38:18,986
Okay.

682
00:38:20,986 --> 00:38:22,186
Go easy with the threads.

683
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:25,386
Huh?

684
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,086
It's my best outfit.

685
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:30,986
Why did you call me
Nephilim?

686
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:31,886
'Cause that's what you are.

687
00:38:31,886 --> 00:38:33,186
You're half-angel,
half-human.

688
00:38:37,486 --> 00:38:38,986
You some sort of cult
person, is that it?

689
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,086
I'm an angel.

690
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:43,686
Name is Ezekiel,
Zeke for short.

691
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:48,286
Okay, okay, I got it.

692
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,586
I'm talking
to a nut case.

693
00:38:50,586 --> 00:38:52,186
Well, ha ha--

694
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,186
You're crazier than me.

695
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:54,986
Have it your way.
Come on, Gabe.

696
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:58,186
Well, Happy 18th Birthday
to you, nonetheless.

697
00:39:01,386 --> 00:39:01,986
Yep.

698
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,086
How did you know
it was my birthday?

699
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:11,686
Nephilim come of age
when they're 18,

700
00:39:12,486 --> 00:39:14,786
and you can smell 'em
a mile away

701
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,486
when they're turning.

702
00:39:18,086 --> 00:39:19,486
Ahh...

703
00:39:19,486 --> 00:39:22,086
And boy, you do
smell of angel.

704
00:39:24,486 --> 00:39:25,486
This is a bunch of bull.

705
00:39:27,286 --> 00:39:29,486
Well, you're taking it
a lot better than most.

706
00:39:31,186 --> 00:39:32,086
What do you mean?

707
00:39:32,086 --> 00:39:34,786
Well, angel nature
and human nature

708
00:39:34,786 --> 00:39:37,586
don't live well
together.

709
00:39:39,786 --> 00:39:42,386
Nephilim, when they
experience both,

710
00:39:42,386 --> 00:39:45,486
they, hmmm,
they go wackadoodle,

711
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:48,086
and you, you're just
a little wonka-wonka.

712
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:52,486
Huh, wonka-wonka--hoo.
Wonka-wonka. Wonka.

713
00:39:54,086 --> 00:39:56,486
I have done your bidding.

714
00:39:56,486 --> 00:39:57,986
I have sought out
the abominations

715
00:39:57,986 --> 00:39:59,186
and destroyed them.

716
00:40:01,786 --> 00:40:05,086
But it has been a long time
since I have heard your words,

717
00:40:06,386 --> 00:40:09,286
a sign that my work
is pleasing in your sight.

718
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:12,786
I know it is not
for me to ask,

719
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,186
but...a sign.

720
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:18,586
if you could just show me--

721
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:20,386
Your lordship.

722
00:40:20,386 --> 00:40:21,286
What?

723
00:40:25,486 --> 00:40:28,386
Your lordship, I thought
you might want these:

724
00:40:30,086 --> 00:40:31,486
the remains of Samshial.

725
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,686
What would I want
with his ashes?

726
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:42,586
Do you think
I'm like these humans,

727
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:45,286
needing their remains
to make themselves feel better?

728
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:48,086
Huh!

729
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:48,586
Wait!

730
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:02,786
A sign.

731
00:41:02,786 --> 00:41:03,286
Thank you.

732
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:09,586
You have done well.

733
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:11,286
For this, you may have
the next kill.

734
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:14,386
Thank you, my lord.

735
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,686
We must send Kolazonta
to Massachusetts

736
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:19,886
to find someone named Corbett.

737
00:41:26,486 --> 00:41:29,086
If you're an angel,
show me your wings.

738
00:41:30,786 --> 00:41:33,686
I'm a Grigori,

739
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:36,086
one of the highest
orders of angels.

740
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:42,186
I, uh, hate to break it
to you, bud,

741
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:44,086
but, uh, those
aren't wings.

742
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:46,486
Uh, yeah, I had 'em
clipped in the fall.

743
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:48,586
Oh, yeah?

744
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:50,686
So they'll grow back
in the spring?

745
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,986
Uh, that's fall,
not as in autumn,

746
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:53,886
uh, as in fallen.

747
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,486
I'm a fallen angel,
so they clipped my wings.

748
00:41:56,986 --> 00:41:58,686
Those scars you got,
they could be from anything:

749
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:00,786
an accident, surgery.

750
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:04,386
Yeah, well,
believe it or not,

751
00:42:04,386 --> 00:42:05,786
I am an angel.

752
00:42:09,186 --> 00:42:11,086
Heh heh heh.

753
00:42:11,086 --> 00:42:12,486
You are Nephilim,

754
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:15,386
which means that,
uh--ha ha--

755
00:42:15,386 --> 00:42:16,286
I want to be
out of here

756
00:42:16,286 --> 00:42:19,086
when they come
looking for you.

757
00:42:19,086 --> 00:42:20,086
Who's "they"?

758
00:42:20,086 --> 00:42:23,086
The Powers.
They, uh, their gig is

759
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:26,686
to get rid of creatures
they're not pleased with,

760
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:29,686
and, uh, usually,
they find 'em

761
00:42:29,686 --> 00:42:32,186
within two days
after their 18th birthday.

762
00:42:32,186 --> 00:42:34,286
Now, you've got,
maybe, a day,

763
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:36,086
something like that,
I think, yeah.

764
00:42:36,086 --> 00:42:40,186
So you're telling me that
because I'm a Nephilim,

765
00:42:40,986 --> 00:42:43,086
God has sent killer
angels after me.

766
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:44,186
Is that what you're
trying to tell me?

767
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,286
God, God
is such a limiting term.

768
00:42:46,286 --> 00:42:49,186
The Creator
is so much more:

769
00:42:49,186 --> 00:42:53,386
Allah, Shiva,
the Tao, Jehovah--

770
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:56,886
Can you please
stick to the point?

771
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:58,986
The point.
Oh, yes, well,

772
00:42:58,986 --> 00:43:03,386
uh, humans and angels
are not supposed to, uh,

773
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:07,186
canoodle, uh, fraternize,
socialize, that sort of thing.

774
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,186
Well, anyway...

775
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:12,386
the result
of our dalliances...

776
00:43:12,386 --> 00:43:15,686
are beings like you,
Nephilim.

777
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:20,486
That's it, here we go.
Aha! My prize, yes.

778
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:23,286
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah, here we go.

779
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:24,986
Play ball!
Yes! Play ball!

780
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:27,386
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not to play with.

781
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:30,686
This is mine. I caught this
is straightaway center field

782
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,186
from Babe Ruth,
and it's signed by him.

783
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:35,386
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can hear my dog?

784
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:38,986
Oh, yes, I can hear
your dog, absolutely.

785
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,786
That's what talking
in tongues is.

786
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:43,286
It's an angel thing.

787
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,586
And we're really good
dancers too--woo-hoo!

788
00:43:49,186 --> 00:43:50,686
Uh, the Powers think

789
00:43:50,686 --> 00:43:54,686
that they are the Creator's
personal storm troopers,

790
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:59,386
and their whole goal
is to get rid of Nephilim,

791
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:03,786
and they absolutely
hate the Fallen.

792
00:44:03,986 --> 00:44:06,286
Why? Why do they
hate the Fallen?

793
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:09,286
The important thing is that
Camael, leader of the Powers,

794
00:44:09,286 --> 00:44:13,086
is here, and he's probably
looking for you.

795
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:13,986
What is that?

796
00:44:13,986 --> 00:44:15,486
Wait a minute.
That's my name.

797
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,786
This is just a bruise.
That ain't no bruise.

798
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:19,386
That's a mark.
That's ancient writing.

799
00:44:19,386 --> 00:44:21,686
This is getting weird!
I wanna get--

800
00:44:21,686 --> 00:44:25,586
That--That's, uh--
That's ancient writing.

801
00:44:25,586 --> 00:44:26,986
That's, uh--
I'm out of here.

802
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:27,886
Wait, wait!

803
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:29,186
Whoa-ho-ho!

804
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:30,286
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

805
00:44:30,286 --> 00:44:32,586
So you tell me some Camel
guy's looking for me?

806
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,886
Whoa! Hold it!

807
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:37,486
Gabe! Ball!
Gabe! No!

808
00:44:37,486 --> 00:44:39,586
Ball! Oh, yeah!
Play ball!

809
00:44:45,072 --> 00:44:45,672
Gabe.

810
00:44:48,772 --> 00:44:50,572
He came out of nowhere.
I didn't even--

811
00:44:50,872 --> 00:44:52,572
Just get help, quick.

812
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:56,772
Gabe, you okay?

813
00:44:56,772 --> 00:44:58,072
Gabriel hurt bad.

814
00:44:58,872 --> 00:45:01,172
Gabe, no. Gabe,
no, no, no, no, no.

815
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:03,072
Please, please,
Gabe, Gabe, Gabe, Gabe.

816
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:03,772
Gabe.

817
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,072
Aaron?

818
00:45:10,672 --> 00:45:13,072
All right, all right.
Move aside, move aside.

819
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:15,272
Let me show you
how a real angel heals.

820
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:17,472
Come on, move aside.

821
00:45:17,472 --> 00:45:17,972
All right.

822
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:20,172
Easy, boy.
Easy, big fella.

823
00:45:20,172 --> 00:45:21,972
I'm gonna take you
for a little ride.

824
00:45:21,972 --> 00:45:22,672
There you are.

825
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:33,072
It...hurts.

826
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:36,872
What is that?
What's happening?

827
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:39,672
Did you see that?

828
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,572
That's his soul
leaving the body.

829
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:48,072
Whoo. That means
I lost my touch.

830
00:45:49,472 --> 00:45:51,372
Sorry, kid. You know
what they say:

831
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:52,172
use it or lose it.

832
00:45:53,372 --> 00:45:55,372
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

833
00:45:55,372 --> 00:45:57,172
There's got to be
something.

834
00:45:57,172 --> 00:45:59,472
No. No, no, no, no, no.

835
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:03,872
Please.

836
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:09,072
That's something you're not
supposed to be able to do,

837
00:46:09,072 --> 00:46:10,572
unless--

838
00:46:10,572 --> 00:46:12,972
Now, look here, now, if you
are what I think you are,

839
00:46:12,972 --> 00:46:16,272
then we can--we can
still save this dog.

840
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:17,772
Please, you've done
enough damage.

841
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:21,272
Look, you either believe me,
and he lives,

842
00:46:21,272 --> 00:46:22,472
or you don't,
and he dies.

843
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,172
Now, it's your choice.

844
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:27,172
You put your hands on him.

845
00:46:27,172 --> 00:46:28,472
Animal Control's
on their way.

846
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:29,072
Now.

847
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:32,672
This is crazy.

848
00:46:34,372 --> 00:46:37,172
You got to tap into
your angel nature.

849
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,972
It's like everything's
speeding up inside ya.

850
00:46:41,072 --> 00:46:44,272
See it in the darkness.
Look hard.

851
00:46:46,572 --> 00:46:47,172
You see it?

852
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:50,572
You see it.

853
00:47:00,272 --> 00:47:01,172
I see something.

854
00:47:02,772 --> 00:47:04,572
Hear it. Call to it.
Let it fill you.

855
00:47:06,372 --> 00:47:06,772
What is it?

856
00:47:06,772 --> 00:47:08,072
No, no, no.
You got to control it.

857
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:10,972
You got to control it.
You got to--

858
00:47:10,972 --> 00:47:12,272
If you're gonna
save this dog,

859
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:14,272
you've got to accept
your angel nature.

860
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:15,872
You've got to open
yourself to it.

861
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:19,072
You've got
to let it fill you.

862
00:47:19,072 --> 00:47:21,572
You've got to accept it
as part of you,

863
00:47:21,572 --> 00:47:24,372
and if you doubt it,
if you question it,

864
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:27,172
it'll destroy you,
or you will destroy it.

865
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:29,572
You understand?

866
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:30,272
Okay.

867
00:47:32,872 --> 00:47:33,672
This is a part of me.

868
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:37,172
This is a part of who I am.

869
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:54,672
Aaron?

870
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:55,372
Where's the ball?

871
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,672
Gabe.

872
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,372
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

873
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,472
Oh, I'm free at last.

874
00:48:06,472 --> 00:48:07,872
Where's the ball?
Where'd the ball go?

875
00:48:07,872 --> 00:48:09,272
I'm free at last!

876
00:48:09,272 --> 00:48:11,072
This is impossible.

877
00:48:11,072 --> 00:48:12,872
I'm not half an angel.

878
00:48:12,872 --> 00:48:13,972
Oh, sorry to tell you, kid,

879
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:15,472
but you're probably
more than that.

880
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:17,072
Ah!

881
00:48:17,972 --> 00:48:20,872
He bears the names
of the Fallen,

882
00:48:20,872 --> 00:48:23,272
he has the touch
of the angels.

883
00:48:25,372 --> 00:48:26,672
No more exile.

884
00:48:26,672 --> 00:48:28,972
Gabe, stay away
from the birds.

885
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:31,072
Don't worry, Aaron.
Gabriel won't hurtrt.

886
00:48:31,072 --> 00:48:32,672
Honing hunting skills.

887
00:48:32,672 --> 00:48:34,572
Honing? Who uses words
like "honing"?

888
00:48:34,572 --> 00:48:36,072
I don't even
words like "honing."

889
00:48:36,072 --> 00:48:39,572
So, if you are
what I think you are,

890
00:48:39,572 --> 00:48:41,772
we've got some business
to tend to.

891
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:42,572
No, we don't.

892
00:48:42,972 --> 00:48:45,872
We have no business
to attend to, okay?

893
00:48:45,872 --> 00:48:47,672
My dog almost died.

894
00:48:47,672 --> 00:48:48,372
There you are.

895
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:49,872
And I just brought him
back to life.

896
00:48:49,872 --> 00:48:53,572
Exact--
That's crazy.
That's insane.

897
00:48:53,572 --> 00:48:55,172
I got to talk to Jonas.

898
00:48:55,172 --> 00:48:56,272
No, no, no, no, no, no.

899
00:48:56,272 --> 00:48:59,472
Go easy with this.
You're quite a find.

900
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:00,572
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

901
00:49:00,572 --> 00:49:02,172
Whatever just happened's
never gonna happen again.

902
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,672
Great! I can help you!
I can make it all go away.

903
00:49:06,272 --> 00:49:09,672
Yes, I can. There's just
one little thing
you have to do for me:

904
00:49:10,272 --> 00:49:12,572
Redeem me.
What?

905
00:49:12,572 --> 00:49:14,772
You can restore me
to an angel

906
00:49:14,772 --> 00:49:16,172
and send me home.

907
00:49:16,172 --> 00:49:19,572
Then I can call off
the Powers,

908
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:23,072
and you can be
a normal boy again.

909
00:49:23,072 --> 00:49:25,572
Okay, I'm--
I'm out of here.

910
00:49:25,572 --> 00:49:27,172
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

911
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,572
Listen. Listen to me.
Just stay here.

912
00:49:28,572 --> 00:49:30,972
Just listen to me, please.
Just listen for a moment.

913
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:34,472
Now, there is a chance
that you can redeem me,

914
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,972
and clear me
of my transgressions.

915
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:39,372
How can I redeem you?

916
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:40,772
I don't know
what that means.

917
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:41,972
I don't know
if you're real.

918
00:49:41,972 --> 00:49:43,772
You know I'm real.
Come over here.

919
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,172
Let me give you
something here.

920
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:47,672
Babe Ruth signed this.
It's yours. Here.

921
00:49:47,672 --> 00:49:50,272
It's not about the payment.
Do you understand?

922
00:49:50,272 --> 00:49:52,872
This is just--This is--
This is too weird.

923
00:49:52,872 --> 00:49:55,172
All right, all right,
all right.

924
00:49:55,172 --> 00:49:56,772
The prophesy
said you would come,

925
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:58,172
and here you are,

926
00:49:58,172 --> 00:50:01,472
so all I'm asking you to do
is to redeem me.

927
00:50:01,472 --> 00:50:08,772
Just, uh, touch me,
to wave your hands over me,

928
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,272
have redeeming thoughts.

929
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:11,772
I don't even know

930
00:50:11,772 --> 00:50:12,972
Please, just do it,
do it,

931
00:50:12,972 --> 00:50:14,472
and I won't ask you
anything more.

932
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,772
Just--I promise.

933
00:50:16,772 --> 00:50:19,472
All right, fine.

934
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:22,772
You're--You're saved.
You're redeemed. Whatever.

935
00:50:22,772 --> 00:50:23,672
That's it?

936
00:50:23,672 --> 00:50:25,872
No. See? You got
the wrong guy.

937
00:50:25,872 --> 00:50:27,472
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, try again.

938
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:28,872
Try like you did
with the dog.

939
00:50:28,872 --> 00:50:30,872
Look what you did with the dog.
Huh?

940
00:50:32,772 --> 00:50:33,272
Come on.

941
00:50:46,072 --> 00:50:46,672
Are you satisfied?

942
00:50:48,472 --> 00:50:50,072
All right, go on,
go on, damn it.

943
00:50:50,072 --> 00:50:52,272
Just go on.
Don't redeem me.

944
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:54,372
Let me give you
a little advice, Mister!

945
00:50:54,372 --> 00:50:56,372
You better get
your butt out of here

946
00:50:56,372 --> 00:50:58,072
because if the Powers
find you,

947
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:00,272
your ass is grass,
you understand that?

948
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:02,472
I'm getting out of here.
I've had enough of you.

949
00:51:12,072 --> 00:51:13,872
Super sauce comin' at ya.

950
00:51:13,872 --> 00:51:15,372
Hey! Happy Birthday!

951
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,772
Hey, Happy
Belated Birthday!

952
00:51:17,772 --> 00:51:19,672
Ready for some of that
special spaghetti sauce?

953
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:26,872
Aaron?

954
00:51:26,872 --> 00:51:27,972
It's okay.

955
00:51:27,972 --> 00:51:28,772
Hey, is everything okay?

956
00:51:28,772 --> 00:51:30,872
What's wrong?

957
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:32,672
Aaron?

958
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,572
What's wrong?

959
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:36,072
You can tell us.

960
00:51:36,072 --> 00:51:37,572
Um, I just, um...

961
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:40,572
Thank you.

962
00:51:42,772 --> 00:51:45,172
Thank you for--
for everything.

963
00:51:45,172 --> 00:51:46,572
I just want you guys
to know

964
00:51:46,572 --> 00:51:48,572
that I can never repay you.

965
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:51,472
Repay us?
Buddy, we're family.

966
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:52,572
We don't repay.

967
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:54,272
Hey,
we love you.

968
00:51:54,272 --> 00:51:55,872
I love you too,
Mom and Dad.

969
00:51:58,472 --> 00:52:00,772
Please don't
forget that.

970
00:52:00,772 --> 00:52:03,172
Um, don't worry.
We won't.

971
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,772
Come on, let's eat.

972
00:52:11,472 --> 00:52:13,672
Oh, my God.
Look what he's doing.

973
00:52:16,272 --> 00:52:19,272
Stevie, did you
do that, sweetie?

974
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,472
Angel.

975
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:23,772
Oh, my God,
you're speaking!

976
00:52:23,772 --> 00:52:25,372
Stevie,
you're talking!

977
00:52:25,372 --> 00:52:26,072
Hey!

978
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:26,972
Hey, hi, Stevie!

979
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:27,772
Hi, sweetheart.

980
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:30,972
Where's
the video camera?

981
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,172
Uh...
We got to get this
on tape.

982
00:52:32,172 --> 00:52:34,772
Go, go, go, go.
Baby, it's me, Mommy.

983
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:37,072
Hey, can you say "Mommy"?

984
00:52:38,272 --> 00:52:40,072
Aaron.

985
00:52:40,072 --> 00:52:41,672
He's--
Stevie's speaking.

986
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:45,472
Hey, can you say
something for me?

987
00:52:45,472 --> 00:52:46,972
Aaron.

988
00:52:46,972 --> 00:52:48,672
Angels.

989
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:50,772
Angels come.

990
00:52:50,772 --> 00:52:52,172
He knows who
you are, Aaron.

991
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,572
This is amazing.
He knows who you are.

992
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,310
I think I'll call in
sick tomorrow

993
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,010
and come with you
and Stevie to the clinic.

994
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:22,310
What if he's
getting better?

995
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:24,610
What if this
is all a mistake?

996
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:27,410
Take it easy.
One step at a time.

997
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,210
Yeah.

998
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,610
You missed weigh-in
this morning.

999
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,610
Hmm?

1000
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:34,810
Coach Chaney called.

1001
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,210
Tell her what
Dr. Jonas said.

1002
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:40,810
I, uh, was doing
a report for school.

1003
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:42,810
Dr. Jonas said that you
should tell Tom and--

1004
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,710
Oh, cake!

1005
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,910
That's good. Can't make it
on brawn alone.

1006
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,410
I got to get
this one to bed.

1007
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,010
I'm gonna, uh, go
get some fresh air.

1008
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:57,610
Oh, there we go.
You're a big boy.

1009
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,110
The Studebaker parts
finally came.

1010
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,610
Water's stuck
in the pit again.

1011
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,610
Oh, yeah. We're gonna
have to get that fixed
one of these days.

1012
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,510
Here you go.

1013
00:54:42,010 --> 00:54:43,510
Quite a day, huh?

1014
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,910
I mean, with, uh, Stevie,

1015
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,410
and plus it being
your birthday.

1016
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:47,910
Yeah.

1017
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,510
You know, Stevie talking...

1018
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:59,610
We've been hoping
for something like that
for...years.

1019
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,210
Yeah, I know.

1020
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:10,610
Well, Lori and I, uh--
your mom and I--

1021
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:13,310
Look, I remember
turning 18.

1022
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,310
I was still in foster care,

1023
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:18,110
and I waited my whole life
for that birthday

1024
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:20,210
so I could get out
on my own

1025
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:22,110
and stop bouncing
from place to place.

1026
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,210
Look, just because
you've turned 18,

1027
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,910
and legally
you're an adult,

1028
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,210
that doesn't mean
we're not family.

1029
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,010
Tom--

1030
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,310
Uh, Dad,

1031
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,210
there's stuff going on.

1032
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,110
I'm really scared.

1033
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,810
I think there's
something wrong with me.

1034
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:50,010
I mean, um...

1035
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,110
I'm afraid my parents
weren't normal.

1036
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:56,310
Aaron, you and I have talked
about how I was at your age.

1037
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:00,310
You know,
I stole, and I lied,

1038
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:01,710
and I got kicked out
of every foster home

1039
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,110
within a few months.

1040
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,010
I know, but--

1041
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,810
Wait, wait.
It's because I thought

1042
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:08,310
my biological parents
were bad people.

1043
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:10,410
And I thought I was bad,

1044
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:13,010
you know, like I didn't
have a choice.

1045
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,110
I was--I was a victim
of my own fear.

1046
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,910
You understand
what I'm saying?

1047
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:19,710
Yeah, but--

1048
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,210
But then I started to see

1049
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,310
that I was taking
the easy way:

1050
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,810
you know, blaming others
for how my life was going.

1051
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,310
But the only person
in charge of my life was me,

1052
00:56:31,310 --> 00:56:33,710
and I had a choice.

1053
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,510
You know, I could be
angry and resentful,

1054
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,510
or I could work,

1055
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:39,910
and create a life
that I could be proud of.

1056
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,910
But I think there's
something wrong with me.

1057
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,410
Aaron, there's nothing
wrong with you.

1058
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:51,110
You're human,
like all of us.

1059
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:55,310
You're a good kid.

1060
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:58,610
I mean,
you're a good man.

1061
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:01,110
You have refused to let
what happened to you

1062
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:01,910
define who you are.

1063
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:07,510
I'm proud to have you
as my son.

1064
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:12,410
Come here.

1065
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,510
Hello.

1066
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,210
I was wondering
if you could help me.

1067
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:30,310
I'm looking
for someone.

1068
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:32,010
Well,
I'm the only one here.

1069
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:33,910
How did you get in here?

1070
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,110
A boy. Just turned 18.

1071
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:37,710
An orphan.

1072
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:40,210
He has...abilities.

1073
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:43,710
I think you'd better leave.
There's no one here.

1074
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,710
It's the damnedest thing.

1075
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,510
I haven't seen
anything like it,

1076
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,410
not in my entire life.

1077
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:03,910
You know,
I never believed

1078
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:06,710
in spontaneous human
combustion before,

1079
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:08,510
but there's
no other explanation.

1080
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,310
The guy was completely
incinerated.

1081
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:12,210
Just him and the phone.

1082
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:15,910
Fire doesn't work that way.

1083
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,210
It's the damnedest thing.

1084
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,710
Excuse me.

1085
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:21,610
The doctor who works here,
is he okay?

1086
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:23,210
You family?

1087
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:25,810
He's my friend.

1088
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,810
I'm sorry, kid. I can't
say anything officially.

1089
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:31,710
We see Dr. Jonas?

1090
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,910
No.

1091
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:36,310
We don't.

1092
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,710
This is so screwed up.

1093
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,310
Who's gonna
believe me, huh?

1094
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:51,610
All right, I'll be
right back, okay?

1095
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:04,010
Brady, have you seen
Vilma Rodriguez?

1096
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,910
You mean the girl you've
been pining over all year?

1097
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,710
If you see her, tell her
I can't make study hall.

1098
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:10,410
Here, let me.

1099
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:17,310
Geez, Corbett, you ripped
the whole door off.

1100
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,310
What's with you?

1101
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:20,710
Hey, Corbett-hole, surprised
to see you at school.

1102
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:22,310
You been hiding or what?

1103
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:23,710
Not now, Lockhart.

1104
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,610
Find Vilma,
and tell her I'll
talk to her later.

1105
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,710
Don't turn
your back on me.

1106
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:29,010
I'm just gonna get
the vice-principal.

1107
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,910
No. Brady, you intervene,
and you're next.

1108
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,410
Peter, don't do this,
okay?

1109
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,010
You're dead.

1110
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:05,010
You're a freak, Corbett.

1111
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,210
How did you do that?

1112
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:11,710
Honestly, I--

1113
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,310
I have no clue, man.

1114
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:17,410
Things
are really screwed up.

1115
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,510
I can't even...

1116
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,410
begin to explain.

1117
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,110
Aaron.

1118
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:24,610
There you are.

1119
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:26,110
Hi.
Hi.

1120
01:00:26,110 --> 01:00:29,010
Um, listen, I got to cancel
our study date.

1121
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,310
I know. I figured you were
already in there.

1122
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,710
What? In where?

1123
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:35,110
In the counselor's office.
They were looking for you.

1124
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,710
There's a guy here
from Cornell.

1125
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,410
Oh, no, no, no.
Now is not a good time.

1126
01:00:40,410 --> 01:00:41,710
Don't be silly.
You'll be fine.

1127
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,010
Just be yourself.

1128
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,910
New York, can you imagine?
That is so cool.

1129
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,510
I want to hear what happens
with the interview.

1130
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,110
I'm gonna be by the cafe
around 4 P.M.

1131
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,310
You can tell me
all about it.

1132
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,210
Tree.

1133
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,210
Bird.

1134
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,310
"Significant improvement."

1135
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:32,610
That's what he said.

1136
01:01:32,610 --> 01:01:35,110
I'll get out of work
and go with you.

1137
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:36,710
I'd like to check out
this new doctor.

1138
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:38,710
Aaron! Help Aaron!

1139
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:39,710
Oh! Hey, Stevie,
you're okay.

1140
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:51,210
If you're gonna
kill me...

1141
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:51,610
just do it.

1142
01:02:01,538 --> 01:02:02,238
What are you waiting for?

1143
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,438
Just do it.

1144
01:02:05,438 --> 01:02:06,038
Kill me.

1145
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:06,838
Kill you?

1146
01:02:07,738 --> 01:02:10,338
I've been looking for you
for centuries.

1147
01:02:10,338 --> 01:02:11,738
I'm here to protect you.

1148
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:20,938
There was a great battle.

1149
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:23,138
A mighty angel
convinced many followers

1150
01:02:23,138 --> 01:02:26,638
to rebel against the teachings
of the Creator.

1151
01:02:26,638 --> 01:02:27,838
Although these rebels
were strong,

1152
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:29,738
they did not win their fight.

1153
01:02:29,738 --> 01:02:31,638
They were banished
to the Earth.

1154
01:02:31,638 --> 01:02:32,538
Their wings were clipped.

1155
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:34,438
The Fallen.

1156
01:02:36,038 --> 01:02:37,538
You killed them.

1157
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:38,038
In the past.

1158
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,638
I thought it was
my holy mission

1159
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:44,438
to eradicate the Fallen
and their offspring.

1160
01:02:44,438 --> 01:02:46,738
You've eradicated
others like me?

1161
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:47,638
Yes, I have.

1162
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:50,338
Then why are you
so set on saving me?

1163
01:02:50,338 --> 01:02:53,938
I mean, aren't I one
of your abominations?

1164
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:57,138
A prophet once said
that a Nephilim would be born

1165
01:02:57,138 --> 01:03:00,038
who could forgive the Fallen
of their sins

1166
01:03:00,038 --> 01:03:03,538
so that they may
return to the Source.

1167
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:05,838
I saw that the Creator
had a plan

1168
01:03:05,838 --> 01:03:08,438
much greater
than I could comprehend.

1169
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:10,838
After that, I could no longer
be a part of the killing,

1170
01:03:10,838 --> 01:03:13,438
and I realized
that I had to save those

1171
01:03:13,438 --> 01:03:14,738
the Powers
wished to destroy.

1172
01:03:16,738 --> 01:03:18,438
This is ridiculous.

1173
01:03:19,638 --> 01:03:20,438
What are you,
like, part

1174
01:03:20,438 --> 01:03:22,638
of the Angelic Witness
Protection Agency or something?

1175
01:03:23,638 --> 01:03:25,038
I don't understand.

1176
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:26,638
So basically,
I'm screwed.

1177
01:03:26,638 --> 01:03:28,538
I either go into hiding,

1178
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:30,838
or I'm killed
by fanatic angels.

1179
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:32,038
That's--That's great.

1180
01:03:32,038 --> 01:03:34,738
There is another thing.
I don't want to hear it.

1181
01:03:34,738 --> 01:03:37,638
We have studied the signs
foretold by the prophet.

1182
01:03:37,638 --> 01:03:40,938
A child would be born
when the Sun was in Virgo.

1183
01:03:40,938 --> 01:03:43,438
The footprint of the father
would mark his birthplace

1184
01:03:43,438 --> 01:03:45,938
and he would be called
as a Messenger.

1185
01:03:45,938 --> 01:03:47,038
Get toto the point.

1186
01:03:47,038 --> 01:03:48,938
These signs
have led us to you.

1187
01:03:51,438 --> 01:03:53,238
It is possible

1188
01:03:53,238 --> 01:03:55,138
that you are the one that
I have been searching for.

1189
01:03:57,738 --> 01:04:00,338
Okay, well, I hate
to break your bubble,

1190
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,638
but I'm not, okay?

1191
01:04:01,638 --> 01:04:03,938
Zeke fed me that whole
redeeming line too, and--

1192
01:04:03,938 --> 01:04:05,638
You've met Ezekiel?

1193
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:08,238
Yeah. I tried the whole
redeeming thing on him,

1194
01:04:08,238 --> 01:04:10,238
and it didn't work.
I'm not your guy.

1195
01:04:10,238 --> 01:04:11,938
So why don't you
leave me alone, okay?

1196
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:13,538
Ezekiel is not
to be trusted.

1197
01:04:13,538 --> 01:04:15,238
According to Zeke,
neither are you.

1198
01:04:15,238 --> 01:04:16,838
If Ezekiel knows
that you're here,

1199
01:04:16,838 --> 01:04:18,238
he will tell the Powers.

1200
01:04:18,238 --> 01:04:19,638
Whether you are
the Redeemer or not,

1201
01:04:19,638 --> 01:04:21,038
your life
is in grave danger.

1202
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:23,838
I can protect you.
I can hide you.

1203
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:26,038
There's no way.
They've killed
your friend Dr. Jonas.

1204
01:04:26,038 --> 01:04:26,838
Stop it.

1205
01:04:26,838 --> 01:04:28,238
They have killed
my friend Samchial.

1206
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:30,338
They will kill your family.
They will kill you.

1207
01:04:30,338 --> 01:04:32,238
Stop it.

1208
01:04:32,238 --> 01:04:34,038
Look, I've been
kicked around

1209
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:35,238
since I was a baby,

1210
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:36,738
one foster home
to another.

1211
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:39,038
and all I ever wanted
was a normal life.

1212
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:41,538
And now I'm graduating
high school,

1213
01:04:41,538 --> 01:04:42,938
and colleges
are interested in me,

1214
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:44,438
and I have a family
that loves me,

1215
01:04:44,438 --> 01:04:48,438
and, you know, there's
this girl I just met--

1216
01:04:48,438 --> 01:04:50,438
And all this angel stuff,
I--I just--

1217
01:04:50,438 --> 01:04:51,738
I can't take it.

1218
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:53,638
I don't want
any part of it.

1219
01:04:54,738 --> 01:04:57,238
You have no choice.

1220
01:04:57,238 --> 01:04:59,138
I have no choice?

1221
01:04:59,138 --> 01:05:00,638
Screw you.
I have a choice,

1222
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:02,538
and I'm choosing
to be rid of you

1223
01:05:02,538 --> 01:05:03,738
and all this angel crap,

1224
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:05,838
so why don't you go
back to Heaven

1225
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:07,338
and leave me
the hell alone?

1226
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:11,938
As you wish.

1227
01:05:27,238 --> 01:05:29,438
Ezekiel, my old friend,

1228
01:05:29,438 --> 01:05:32,938
and always as-- fragrant as ever.

1229
01:05:32,938 --> 01:05:35,138
I thought I'd
stop by and say "hi,"

1230
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:36,338
talk over old times.

1231
01:05:37,138 --> 01:05:38,538
Oh, by the way,

1232
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:41,538
have you seen any Nephilim
in these parts?

1233
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:44,638
Oh-ho-ho...

1234
01:05:44,638 --> 01:05:46,538
They must have passed
right on by.

1235
01:05:47,738 --> 01:05:49,538
Sorry.

1236
01:05:49,538 --> 01:05:51,238
Come on, Ezekiel.

1237
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,238
We have always had
such a good arrangement.

1238
01:05:54,238 --> 01:05:57,138
Mutually beneficial,
wouldn't you say?

1239
01:05:57,138 --> 01:05:59,538
You tell us
where the Nephilim are,

1240
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:01,438
and we let you live.

1241
01:06:01,438 --> 01:06:02,738
Ohh...

1242
01:06:03,538 --> 01:06:06,138
I...know nothing.

1243
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:08,738
Oh, that's funny,

1244
01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:10,738
because his scent
is all over the place.

1245
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:13,438
And I find it
very interesting

1246
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:16,338
that you gave up
your own child,

1247
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:19,138
but this one
you protect.

1248
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:20,738
I haven't seen him.

1249
01:06:20,738 --> 01:06:21,438
Hmm...

1250
01:06:23,538 --> 01:06:25,738
I haven't seen him.

1251
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:26,338
Hmm.

1252
01:06:28,038 --> 01:06:28,638
I...

1253
01:06:28,638 --> 01:06:30,138
Non, s'il vous plat!

1254
01:06:30,138 --> 01:06:31,838
Nephilim.

1255
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:33,438
Papa! Papa!

1256
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,338
Aaah!

1257
01:06:39,338 --> 01:06:41,938
It's him, or it's you.

1258
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:42,938
Ohh...

1259
01:06:47,738 --> 01:06:50,138
I'll tell Tom and Lori.

1260
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:51,938
They'll think I'm crazy,
but I have to.

1261
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:52,638
Aaron, look out!

1262
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:54,638
Oh-ho-ho. Whoa!

1263
01:06:56,038 --> 01:06:58,338
What's wrong with you?

1264
01:06:58,338 --> 01:07:00,938
Uh, look, I'm, uh--

1265
01:07:00,938 --> 01:07:01,938
Stupid idiot!

1266
01:07:01,938 --> 01:07:03,738
Yeah, well,
nevertheless,

1267
01:07:03,738 --> 01:07:05,438
uh, the Powers
are looking for you,

1268
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:10,438
and I had to, uh, well,
tell 'em where you live, so--

1269
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:14,338
You sent killer angels
to my house?

1270
01:07:14,338 --> 01:07:15,538
What about my family?

1271
01:07:15,538 --> 01:07:16,938
That's a good point,
That's a good point.

1272
01:07:16,938 --> 01:07:18,638
Now, if you're lucky,

1273
01:07:18,638 --> 01:07:22,538
Verchiel will spend time
questioning and...

1274
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,138
killing 'em--
nicely, I'm sure--

1275
01:07:24,138 --> 01:07:26,538
and then you'll have time to escape.
What?

1276
01:07:26,538 --> 01:07:29,938
Yes. Well, they're
not your family anyway.

1277
01:07:29,938 --> 01:07:32,038
I love them.
Oh, that's sweet.

1278
01:07:32,038 --> 01:07:35,138
I'm sure they appreciate it,
but you better run right now.

1279
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,138
I'm not gonna run.
I'm not a coward like you.

1280
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:40,438
Courage
is vastly overrated.

1281
01:07:40,438 --> 01:07:41,838
Why are you doing this?

1282
01:07:41,838 --> 01:07:43,438
I am not
your precious Redeemer.

1283
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:46,538
I'm doing this
to help you out.

1284
01:07:46,538 --> 01:07:48,738
Now just run.
You disgust me.

1285
01:07:48,738 --> 01:07:51,038
I'd rather love and die
than live and hate myself.

1286
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:51,738
Oh, that's beautiful.

1287
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:54,538
If it's me they want,
it's me they'll get.

1288
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,038
I'm not gonna let them
hurt my family.

1289
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,338
come on ?

1290
01:07:57,338 --> 01:07:58,538
Wait a minute. Wait!

1291
01:07:58,538 --> 01:07:59,638
Hey, hold on just a second.

1292
01:07:59,638 --> 01:08:02,238
Now, what about--

1293
01:08:02,238 --> 01:08:03,038
What about me?

1294
01:08:12,138 --> 01:08:12,538
Lori?

1295
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:14,338
Tom?

1296
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:23,738
Aaron, we get out of here.

1297
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:25,038
Lori! Tom!

1298
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:31,538
Aaron, what's going on?

1299
01:08:31,538 --> 01:08:33,238
What is this slamming?
What is going on?

1300
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,238
Listen! Go back
into the basement!

1301
01:08:35,238 --> 01:08:36,738
Angels! Angels! Angels!
Lock the door!

1302
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:37,938
Don't come out,
no matter what you hear.

1303
01:08:37,938 --> 01:08:38,738
But, Aaron--

1304
01:08:41,138 --> 01:08:43,038
Just do this for me,
please.

1305
01:08:43,038 --> 01:08:43,838
okay okay

1306
01:08:45,138 --> 01:08:45,638
Wait.

1307
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:50,938
Just go.
Just go, please.

1308
01:08:50,938 --> 01:08:51,538
Okay.

1309
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,538
Protect them.
Don't let them get hurt.

1310
01:08:56,538 --> 01:08:58,438
Come, Nephilim!

1311
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:02,438
Gabriel protect.

1312
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,238
Aaron's fine.

1313
01:09:04,738 --> 01:09:05,338
It's okay.

1314
01:09:18,638 --> 01:09:19,838
Come, Nephilim!

1315
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:25,738
Meet your death!

1316
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:29,238
Kid, go back!

1317
01:09:29,238 --> 01:09:31,138
Run for it!
Go now!

1318
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:37,638
You want a piece of me?
You got it!

1319
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:38,538
Grrr!

1320
01:09:42,438 --> 01:09:43,138
Aah!

1321
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,791
Kushiel, kill Ezekiel!

1322
01:10:13,491 --> 01:10:14,091
Leave him alone.

1323
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:16,291
It's me you want.

1324
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:17,791
Yes, it is!

1325
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:21,191
Look, I don't want
anything to do

1326
01:10:21,191 --> 01:10:23,591
with angels or prophesies.

1327
01:10:23,591 --> 01:10:25,391
So just leave me
and my family alone,

1328
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:28,491
and we won't bother you.
I promise.

1329
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,891
Oh, you promise!

1330
01:10:30,091 --> 01:10:33,091
Ha ha ha!
The abomination bargains!

1331
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:34,091
How amusing!

1332
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:36,391
He's yours.

1333
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:40,491
Must save Aaron.

1334
01:10:43,091 --> 01:10:44,291
Raah!

1335
01:10:54,691 --> 01:10:57,391
Traitor!

1336
01:10:57,391 --> 01:10:58,691
You deserve to die!

1337
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:02,291
He is the Redeemer.

1338
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,891
The Redeemer?
You can't be serious!

1339
01:11:12,991 --> 01:11:14,791
Ha! Ha! Haah!

1340
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:15,891
Aah!

1341
01:11:22,791 --> 01:11:23,591
Peniel!

1342
01:11:25,891 --> 01:11:26,891
Raah!

1343
01:11:30,391 --> 01:11:31,691
Aah! Aah! Aahr!

1344
01:11:37,291 --> 01:11:38,791
Go. Go get a weapon.

1345
01:11:39,391 --> 01:11:40,791
How?

1346
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:41,891
See it in your mind.

1347
01:11:46,191 --> 01:11:46,791
Your turn.

1348
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:53,391
Raah! Ha! Ha! Aah!

1349
01:11:56,591 --> 01:11:57,291
Aahhh...

1350
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,691
Ooohh...

1351
01:12:15,191 --> 01:12:16,291
Aaarh!

1352
01:12:25,391 --> 01:12:26,691
Aarh! Aah! Aah!

1353
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:30,591
Aargh!

1354
01:12:33,491 --> 01:12:34,391
Raah! Aah!

1355
01:12:36,491 --> 01:12:37,291
Aah!

1356
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:06,991
Mama's gonna
touch you, baby.

1357
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:07,991
There we go.

1358
01:13:09,891 --> 01:13:12,391
Ha ha! Ha ha!

1359
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:23,191
Aah!

1360
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,991
Stop! You can't
kill the Redeemer!

1361
01:14:02,591 --> 01:14:05,191
He's part of the Creator's
divine plan!

1362
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:07,791
Him? You're not
just a traitor,

1363
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:08,991
you're also a fool.

1364
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:12,291
Look at him! Has anyone
ever fought back before?

1365
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,991
Can't you feel
his presence?

1366
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,791
Tell me this
isn't different.

1367
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:22,591
You almost had me.

1368
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:24,391
No!

1369
01:14:28,491 --> 01:14:29,091
Oh!

1370
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:42,791
Oh, my God! Aaron!

1371
01:14:43,591 --> 01:14:47,291
Aaron! Angel!
Aaron! Angel!

1372
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:48,791
Aaron!

1373
01:14:48,791 --> 01:14:49,891
Aaron! Angel!

1374
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:52,491
Aaron! Aaron!

1375
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,391
So much for your prophesy.

1376
01:14:58,391 --> 01:14:58,991
What have you done?

1377
01:15:02,391 --> 01:15:03,291
Aaron!

1378
01:15:04,491 --> 01:15:06,191
Angel! Aaron!

1379
01:15:06,591 --> 01:15:08,091
Aaron! Trapped!

1380
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,691
Open up!

1381
01:15:09,691 --> 01:15:10,891
Aaron!

1382
01:15:10,891 --> 01:15:12,491
Aaron!
We're trapped!

1383
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:13,591
Aaron!

1384
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,391
Uh...

1385
01:15:36,891 --> 01:15:37,991
Thank you.

1386
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:03,891
I misjudged you.

1387
01:16:03,891 --> 01:16:05,491
I was waiting for a sign.

1388
01:16:05,491 --> 01:16:07,191
I--I understand now.

1389
01:16:11,791 --> 01:16:14,491
Fine. You go ahead,
and you get rid of me,

1390
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:16,591
but that is not gonna
solve your problem.

1391
01:16:16,591 --> 01:16:18,691
The Powers will never
let you roam this planet.

1392
01:16:18,691 --> 01:16:20,291
They will hunt you down.

1393
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,591
And you will have to leave.

1394
01:16:24,591 --> 01:16:26,491
Your family will never
be safe with you here.

1395
01:16:32,591 --> 01:16:33,791
Aaron!

1396
01:16:33,791 --> 01:16:34,491
Aaron, look out!

1397
01:16:38,191 --> 01:16:39,391
Agrrr!

1398
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:50,691
He stood you up.

1399
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:52,291
Something
could have happened.

1400
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,491
I'll give him
ten more minutes.

1401
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:55,591
It's almost 5.

1402
01:16:57,191 --> 01:16:58,391
I'll wait for him
a little longer.

1403
01:17:08,591 --> 01:17:09,891
Zeke.

1404
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,691
You came back.
You surprised me.

1405
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:13,691
Yeah...

1406
01:17:13,691 --> 01:17:15,291
I surprised myself.

1407
01:17:19,391 --> 01:17:21,591
Oh, no. Don't touch me.

1408
01:17:23,091 --> 01:17:26,391
If you use your powers,
it's like a beacon.

1409
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:28,691
They may send someone
back to look for you.

1410
01:17:30,191 --> 01:17:32,991
It is true.

1411
01:17:32,991 --> 01:17:34,691
But don't they
already know?

1412
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:36,491
If you forsake your powers,

1413
01:17:36,491 --> 01:17:38,891
you can save the life
you have here.

1414
01:17:38,891 --> 01:17:42,291
If not, you will become
what you were born to be:

1415
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:43,391
the Redeemer.

1416
01:17:49,691 --> 01:17:51,091
Zeke.

1417
01:17:51,091 --> 01:17:51,991
I want the truth.

1418
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,091
Do you regret letting others
die so you could live?

1419
01:17:59,491 --> 01:18:00,091
Yes.

1420
01:18:06,191 --> 01:18:07,091
So would I.

1421
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:49,191
Hey.

1422
01:18:51,591 --> 01:18:53,791
Open up! Aaron!

1423
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:55,891
Come back!

1424
01:18:55,891 --> 01:18:57,191
I'm going away now.

1425
01:18:58,491 --> 01:18:59,191
No.

1426
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:02,291
But I'll always
be with you, okay?

1427
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:04,691
Aaron.

1428
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:05,991
Aaron! Angel.

1429
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,791
Aaron!

1430
01:19:10,791 --> 01:19:11,391
Here.

1431
01:19:16,391 --> 01:19:18,491
Aaron. Angel.

1432
01:19:20,891 --> 01:19:22,191
Aaron! The longer you stay,

1433
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,391
the greater the danger.

1434
01:19:25,491 --> 01:19:26,291
I'll come back.

1435
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:29,291
I promise.

1436
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:33,391
Gabe? Gabe?

1437
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:34,591
Can you hear me?
Come here, boy.

1438
01:19:35,391 --> 01:19:37,191
Tell Mom and Dad
that I love them, okay?

1439
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:01,891
Lori!

1440
01:20:11,991 --> 01:20:12,591
Lori.

1441
01:20:18,891 --> 01:20:20,091
Hey, hey, it's Aaron.

1442
01:20:20,091 --> 01:20:21,991
There's something horrible
that's happening.

1443
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:23,791
What is going on?
Where's Aaron?

1444
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:24,591
I don't know--

1445
01:20:24,591 --> 01:20:26,891
Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!

1446
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:30,391
Aaron!

1447
01:20:35,791 --> 01:20:36,391
Hey.

1448
01:21:32,391 --> 01:21:33,991
It has been said
they walk among us...

1449
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:37,091
that they guide us.

1450
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:39,791
It could be the banker...

1451
01:21:41,891 --> 01:21:42,691
the girl next door...

1452
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:46,191
or the cop on the beat.

1453
01:21:48,991 --> 01:21:50,791
But I know now
that some tempt us.

1454
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:54,691
They even destroy
what we believe in.

1455
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:58,291
My future is not my own.

1456
01:22:01,012 --> 01:22:03,008
My destiny has been re-written.

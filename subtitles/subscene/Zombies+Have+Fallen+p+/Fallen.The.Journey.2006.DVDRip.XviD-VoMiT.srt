1
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:04,021
Previously on Fallen...

2
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,581
When God created man,

3
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:35,501
a jealous Lucifer mounted
a great rebellion in Heaven.

4
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,581
His army of angels
was defeated

5
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:39,581
and forever banished
from paradise.

6
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:41,701
These angels, the Fallen,

7
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:44,181
abandoned Lucifer,
choosing to live on Earth

8
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:45,741
among the pleasures of humans.

9
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:48,981
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

10
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,741
children called Nephilim.

11
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:53,741
They have the powers
of angels
but the souls of men.

12
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:56,141
Angry, the Creator
flooded the Earth,

13
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,221
killing the Nephilim
and driving the Fallen
into hiding.

14
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,981
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

15
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:03,901
to hunt those
that survived the flood.

16
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:07,621
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy.

17
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,421
A Nephilim would be born

18
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:11,741
who would redeem them
and return them to paradise.

19
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:15,061
So the Fallen watched...
and waited.

20
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,941
Sometimes I...

21
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,781
wonder what it would be like
if Lucifer had won|the war.

22
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,141
I mean, it's not like
he got us on his side

23
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:38,501
with promises of an evil empire
and

24
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,221
eternal suffering.

25
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,181
All that came later...
after the Fall.

26
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,541
I've tried my best
to make up
for what I've done.

27
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,501
To help the humans
defend themselves

28
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:52,541
against what I helped to create.
But...

29
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,421
I mean, there's just
as much hate in the world,
just as much suffering.

30
00:02:56,621 --> 00:03:00,221
More, even.
So have I atoned
for what I have done?

31
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,501
I don't know.

32
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,541
I just know
I wanna go home.

33
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,661
Then that's where you'll go.

34
00:04:11,781 --> 00:04:13,901
It's been one year since I found out
that I have the power

35
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:16,061
to send Fallen angels
back to Heaven.

36
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:19,541
But the Powers can sense
every redemption.

37
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:23,621
And we always risk
the possibility of an attack.

38
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,341
So we never stop running.

39
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,621
So many Fallen...

40
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,901
yet to be redeemed.

41
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,941
Be patient.

42
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,581
Stay here.

43
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:05,541
I'm fighting with you this time.
No, you're not.

44
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:24,181
I'm not gonna just sit here.

45
00:05:26,461 --> 00:05:27,221
Aaron!

46
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:39,381
Most Nephilim
don't put up a fight.

47
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:41,261
Well, I'm not like
most Nephilim.

48
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,221
You'll die like them,|though.

49
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:03,301
I don't know what just happened to me.
I told you to stay in the car.

50
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:05,181
It's like I almost
wasn't even there.

51
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,501
I remember fighting, but it's
like remembering a dream.

52
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,141
I felt like I could take on
the Powers all by myself.

53
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:15,061
- I almost felt like I was invincible.
- You are far from it.

54
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:19,261
When you lose control like that,
you are losing the very thing

55
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:21,981
that gives you the advantage
over your opponent.

56
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,941
You are as powerful
as any angel there is,|Aaron.

57
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,301
But your humanity
makes you stronger.

58
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,901
In time, you will learn
to master this duality,

59
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:34,941
but until then you will focus
on returning the Fallen|to Heaven,

60
00:06:35,021 --> 00:06:36,101
and you will leave
the fighting to me.

61
00:06:36,101 --> 00:06:39,421
If I hadn't fought,
you'd be dead right now,|Camael.

62
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:46,221
Your journey...
has just begun.

63
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:50,541
You must be patient.

64
00:07:04,301 --> 00:07:05,461
You all right?

65
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,661
I could heal you.

66
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:10,621
He did heal me,|Camael.

67
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:16,581
A wound...
caused by angelfire is much different.

68
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,501
You cannot heal it.

69
00:07:21,581 --> 00:07:23,101
What are we
gonna do, then?

70
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:26,181
Find someone who can.

71
00:07:58,621 --> 00:08:00,101
She's gone, Ariel.

72
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:02,421
Get the paddles, Clarence.

73
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:06,861
Get the paddles.

74
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:21,061
Nobody dies on my watch.

75
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:37,661
Welcome back.

76
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,301
Drop me off here.

77
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,901
This may take some time.

78
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,701
Camael.

79
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:54,021
Could we check out|the school?

80
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:57,181
Fine.
But stay close.

81
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,341
And that's the long history of division,
as nation after nation suffered the effects...

82
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,421
Aaron, this is bigger
than your old school.

83
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,141
Well, this is college.
It's different.

84
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:09,821
...and every freethinking
individual is a lost prophet.

85
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:12,421
And every poetic prophecy
is a conscious conspiracy

86
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:14,861
to emancipate ourselves
from mental slavery.

87
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,661
And we will get free or die.

88
00:09:18,381 --> 00:09:20,181
Because the numbers
don't lie.

89
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:23,221
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:26,901
I wasn't even watching where I was going.
No, I wasn't watching where I was going.

91
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:27,661
Hi.

92
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:30,501
Paradise Lost.
I know, it, uh...

93
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:31,501
Yawn.

94
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:37,621
So, uh,
what's your major?

95
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:40,021
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't, uh...

96
00:09:40,341 --> 00:09:42,141
I don't... I don't go
to school here.

97
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,301
Uh, just...
just visiting.

98
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:45,501
Yeah.

99
00:09:46,581 --> 00:09:47,421
Right.

100
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,501
Looks pretty cool,|though.

101
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,861
Yeah, it's okay.

102
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:55,141
- I'm Chloe.
- Aaron.

103
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:57,461
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

104
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:03,861
Excuse me,
is there something
I can help you with?

105
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,061
Hey, you're not supposed|to be in here.

106
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,221
He's right...

107
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:12,221
you're notsupposed to be here.

108
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:14,981
- Ariel.
- Punisher.

109
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,181
Punisher?

110
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:18,541
Yeah, that's what we called
him in high school.

111
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,621
Linebacker.

112
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,381
Wow. This is great.

113
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:33,301
What's it like,
going to college?

114
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,621
I don't know.
It's pretty fun,|I guess.

115
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:37,221
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

116
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:40,061
I mean, it's true what they say,
you know.

117
00:10:40,341 --> 00:10:42,901
Being away from your parents
in a different environment,

118
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,861
you really do learn
a lot about yourself.

119
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,301
What have you learned?

120
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:52,301
that I like partying
almost as much as I hate hangovers.

121
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:57,581
Uh, how come
you don't go?

122
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,261
I... I want to.|I do.

123
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,221
I guess I just...

124
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,781
I got a lot going on|in my...
in my life right now.

125
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:13,781
Well, if you're interested,
you can come to class with me.

126
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:15,341
Help me stay awake.

127
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,501
You can do that?

128
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:18,941
Well, they won't let any random
person come in off the street,

129
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:21,461
but if you're accompanied
by an actual student...

130
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,621
I suppose I could vouch
for you.

131
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:25,581
Thanks.

132
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,781
Well, I'd love to
i'd do something like that.

133
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,741
I would, um...
I just, uh...

134
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:33,781
I don't know|if I can.

135
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,461
Why not?
You need Gabe's permission or something?

136
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:38,101
I like her, Aaron.

137
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:41,301
Come on, 9:00 tomorrow
in that building right over there.

138
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,581
I'm gonna meet you|out front.

139
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,941
I'll see you there.

140
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:22,021
Hello?

141
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:24,581
Who's there?

142
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:30,581
Don't tell me it's judgment day already.

143
00:12:32,021 --> 00:12:36,621
I was just getting comfortable.

144
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:38,541
No, Azazel.

145
00:12:39,781 --> 00:12:40,741
Not yet.

146
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,741
But soon.
Before you know it,

147
00:12:45,621 --> 00:12:47,621
Gabriel's horn
will sound,

148
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:52,461
and you will be cast
into the fires of Hell for all eternity.

149
00:12:53,581 --> 00:12:57,461
I doubt you'll find that
environment any more hospitable.

150
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,221
Well, at least it will be
a change of scenery.

151
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:07,981
What...

152
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:11,381
is this language
we're speaking?

153
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:13,341
It's called English.

154
00:13:14,341 --> 00:13:16,981
It's been very popular|on Earth
for quite some time.

155
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:20,701
How long have
I been here?

156
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,301
5,000 years.

157
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,301
Give or take a century.

158
00:13:27,381 --> 00:13:28,581
I'm curious.

159
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:32,501
Did you think more time had passed,
or less?

160
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,981
What do you want?

161
00:13:38,381 --> 00:13:41,741
To give you...
what you desire most.

162
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:45,381
You'd give me my freedom?

163
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:49,301
If you agree to help me.

164
00:13:50,301 --> 00:13:52,941
It is the time
of the Redeemer, Azazel.

165
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,621
As the prophecy
has foretold,

166
00:13:56,221 --> 00:14:00,941
a Nephilim has been born
with the power to return fallen angels to Heaven.

167
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:06,181
And I need you...
to help him fulfill his destiny.

168
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:09,261
So...

169
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:12,381
do we have an agreement?

170
00:14:14,661 --> 00:14:16,541
We most certainly do.

171
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,788
How are you, Gadreel?

172
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:07,308
How did you get out?

173
00:15:07,468 --> 00:15:09,148
Don't concern yourself
with such things.

174
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,028
You know, you got to learn
how to blend in.

175
00:15:18,828 --> 00:15:21,028
That's how I stayed alive for so long.

176
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:23,748
Fine, but there's something
I should rather do first.

177
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:26,668
I'll bet there is.
But you waited 5,000 years.

178
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,788
You can wait
a few more hours.

179
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:30,428
Can you?

180
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,988
Thousands have taken to the streets

181
00:15:33,988 --> 00:15:37,228
in protests of the arrests of
anti-Russian activists this morning.

182
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:40,028
Cars were set on fire
and storefronts smashed,

183
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:42,908
as an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy
in the capital of Rome.

184
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,668
So who is
this woman, anyway?

185
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,988
Over in the Middle East
oil fires were still burning...

186
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,828
Ariel took over
the underground

187
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:51,388
after the death
of Samchial last year.

188
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:56,268
She's the one who has been giving me
the locations of those you have redeemed.

189
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,908
She's in charge
of the Fallen?

190
00:15:59,188 --> 00:15:59,788
Yes.

191
00:16:05,348 --> 00:16:06,188
Aaron.

192
00:16:10,468 --> 00:16:12,508
It is so good
to finally meet you.

193
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:16,228
God, I feel like I already know you.
Camael's told me so much about you.

194
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,508
He did not tell me how good-looking
you were, though.

195
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:20,028
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

196
00:16:20,348 --> 00:16:22,068
I'm not exactly his type.

197
00:16:26,668 --> 00:16:27,548
What?

198
00:16:28,308 --> 00:16:30,988
It's just... Usually when I'm
around the Fallen, I get this...

199
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,428
weird feeling.

200
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:38,708
Um, it's how I know
they need redemption.

201
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:42,788
I don't feel that need
from you.

202
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:51,108
You're picking up
on their desire|for forgiveness,

203
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:54,028
their beliefs
that they're ready.

204
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:59,108
You know, and whether they're worthy
of redemption or not is a whole other story.

205
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:02,228
But you're not picking it up from me,
because it's not my time yet.

206
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:06,108
I'll be the last Fallen
you'll redeem, Aaron.

207
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,028
Comes with the gig.

208
00:17:11,508 --> 00:17:14,508
Welcome.
There's a bedroom for you upstairs.

209
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:20,788
Come on, Gabe,

210
00:17:31,028 --> 00:17:32,828
The Nephilim
has escaped us again.

211
00:17:34,148 --> 00:17:36,668
You have disgraced us
with your incompetence.

212
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:40,428
You're the mightiest angels
on Heaven and Earth.

213
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,308
And you can't dispose
of one simple half-breed.

214
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,948
The Nephilim we could handle.
It's Camael that's the problem.

215
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:51,028
Mazarin, the energy signature
that drew us here,

216
00:17:51,348 --> 00:17:53,428
there's something different
about it.

217
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:55,868
What if the traitor
is right?

218
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,468
What is this Nephilim he's been dragging
all over the country really is the Redeemer?

219
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:01,028
There is no Reedemer,|Sachael.

220
00:18:03,548 --> 00:18:06,028
It is the Powers' mission
to eradicate all of the Nephilim.

221
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,268
This one is no different
from the rest.

222
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:10,948
Now, when we catch up
with the little bastard,
and we will,

223
00:18:12,268 --> 00:18:14,148
the prophecy will become
a dead issue.

224
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:21,508
You've been killing a lot
of your old friends lately.

225
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:24,348
I take no pleasure in it.

226
00:18:24,428 --> 00:18:27,908
Yeah, that's what you used to say
when you used to kill us Fallen.

227
00:18:28,268 --> 00:18:30,228
It was true then, as well.

228
00:18:32,348 --> 00:18:33,508
So how's he doing?

229
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:36,988
He's struggling.

230
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:41,348
His angelic and human desires
are at constant odds.

231
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:46,428
Yeah, well...
all Nephilim are like that the first few years.

232
00:18:47,348 --> 00:18:48,628
It'll get better.

233
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:50,468
It's getting worse.

234
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,148
Maybe you're just
working him too hard.

235
00:19:07,908 --> 00:19:09,268
You're new here,|ain'tcha?

236
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:10,908
Er... Yeah.

237
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:15,308
Then he went out back
with Gina for, like, 15 minutes.

238
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:16,388
Gina?

239
00:19:18,188 --> 00:19:19,188
The barmaid.

240
00:19:20,188 --> 00:19:21,668
He doesn't
even know her name.

241
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,228
Damn, man.

242
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:26,988
You're all right.
What's with the threads,|though?

243
00:19:27,228 --> 00:19:28,068
Threads?

244
00:19:29,148 --> 00:19:30,788
Oh, you mean my clothes.

245
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:32,988
I like the way you talk.

246
00:19:33,388 --> 00:19:35,188
- The way I what?
- The way I what?

247
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,708
So, you're
a gambling man, huh?

248
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:47,868
You up for a game?

249
00:19:50,908 --> 00:19:52,508
So how does one
play this game?

250
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:56,348
Hold your horses, chief.
We only play for money.

251
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:58,268
I have neither money
nor horses.

252
00:19:58,748 --> 00:20:01,508
- But I'll wager you a night with Gina...
- We could do that.

253
00:20:01,988 --> 00:20:03,588
for your mode
of transportation.

254
00:20:04,148 --> 00:20:05,148
My bike?

255
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,628
Okay, here.

256
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:11,588
I smell a fight.

257
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:14,868
You better come through
once you lose.

258
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:18,788
Teach him
some manners, buddy!

259
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:22,468
It's goin' down.

260
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,348
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

261
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:40,628
Wait a minute now!

262
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,428
You don't mean
my bike, man!

263
00:20:43,268 --> 00:20:44,788
We had a deal,
didn't we...

264
00:20:45,468 --> 00:20:46,388
man?

265
00:20:47,148 --> 00:20:50,548
You want my bike?
Come take it.

266
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,567
Bad dreams again?

267
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,407
You ever have nightmares?

268
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,167
Sometimes.

269
00:21:35,647 --> 00:21:36,647
You know how to stop them?

270
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:38,807
All you have to do is wake up.

271
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:47,407
Morning.

272
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:48,487
Good morning.

273
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:04,527
I've never seen
him sleep before.

274
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:05,967
He's not sleeping.

275
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:07,527
He's healing.

276
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,127
Angelfire wounds
can be bad news.

277
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:12,807
In time,
even a little nick
would have killed him.

278
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:14,447
Don't worry.

279
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,407
By tonight,
he'll be good as new.

280
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:27,727
Mmm, I love waffles.

281
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,327
Thanks.

282
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:42,727
I haven't had a...
real breakfast
in what seems like forever.

283
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:45,887
You miss
your parents, huh?

284
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,127
I just haven't seen them
in a really long time.

285
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:51,607
I wish there was
a way I could...

286
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,167
get a hold of them|and just
tell them that
I'm okay, you know?

287
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:55,967
I know.

288
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,567
But it's safer
for them this way.

289
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,727
Do you know who
my real father
and mother are?

290
00:23:09,007 --> 00:23:12,207
The Fallen don't
exactly advertise it
when one of them
becomes a daddy.

291
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:14,407
It's a good way
to get the Powers
all over your ass.

292
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:17,207
Yeah.

293
00:23:17,847 --> 00:23:19,367
Camael pretty much
said the same thing.

294
00:23:20,047 --> 00:23:20,407
Yeah.

295
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,727
Hey, um...
Do you think it would
be all right if I...

296
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:28,527
went by the, uh,|college
and, uh,

297
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:31,407
just checked out
a couple of the classes?

298
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:34,207
Well, you're a big boy.
You don't need
my permission.

299
00:23:34,567 --> 00:23:36,327
It's just that Camael
never lets me

300
00:23:36,847 --> 00:23:39,487
go anywhere
or do anything.

301
00:23:41,447 --> 00:23:44,327
You're in Ariel's house now.
And I say you can do
whatever you want.

302
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:46,647
Just no angel stuff.

303
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:53,407
Angels.
Warring amongst themselves
because of mankind.

304
00:23:55,127 --> 00:23:58,527
Lucifer's ambition
sprang from envy
that angels

305
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:01,647
were no longer God's
favorite creation.

306
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,367
At the beginning
of Milton's epic,

307
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:07,567
he has suffered
a crushing defeat.

308
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,967
Lucifer and his followers

309
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:13,647
had been banished
from Heaven forever.

310
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:18,287
We see him struggling
with self-doubt.

311
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,287
We see he has hopes|and fears,

312
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:23,687
just like us.

313
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,927
We identify with him.

314
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:29,367
Yes?

315
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:32,607
So, the devil...
he's a good guy?

316
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:38,487
Well...
he's certainly sympathetic.

317
00:24:40,087 --> 00:24:42,247
Lucifer sees himself|as a victim.

318
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:46,927
And it's fair to question
whether the Rebellion

319
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:51,727
was his design,
or pre-ordained destiny.

320
00:24:52,447 --> 00:24:52,967
Wait a second.

321
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:56,967
Are you saying that Lucifer was

322
00:24:57,687 --> 00:24:59,607
created to rebel?

323
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:01,847
Is that so hard to believe?

324
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,367
What is good without evil?

325
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,047
Does doing the right thing

326
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,047
have any meaning

327
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:14,967
if there is
no alternative?

328
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,727
But that doesn't make
any sense.

329
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:22,807
Even if Lucifer
was destined to become
the epitome of evil,

330
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:27,887
he made the choice
to follow that path.

331
00:25:42,047 --> 00:25:44,287
o/~ It's never gonna be o/~

332
00:25:44,927 --> 00:25:47,447
o/~ Normal o/~
o/~ You and me o/~

333
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:51,887
o/~ What you're signing up for
is a storm at sea o/~

334
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,047
You have no idea
how much I miss you,|Azazel.

335
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,487
I'm so glad
you got back.

336
00:26:00,007 --> 00:26:00,647
I know.

337
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:06,767
Well, gotta go.

338
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:12,887
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

339
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:14,927
- You just got here.
- Yep.

340
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,407
I've got something
I need to take care of.

341
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:19,847
What things?

342
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:21,887
The Redeemer's arrived.

343
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,607
Ariel contacted me
a few months ago.

344
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:35,647
Really?

345
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:37,847
Where is she?

346
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,487
Where is she?

347
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:53,327
She lives in this college town
200 miles from here.

348
00:26:53,327 --> 00:26:54,847
Good, then that's
where I'm going.

349
00:26:56,567 --> 00:27:00,287
You know,
your speech has improved,
but your clothes suck.

350
00:27:00,807 --> 00:27:01,927
You need real ones.

351
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,167
Angelic robes aren't
as stylish
as they used to be.

352
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:08,767
I'm sure I'll find you
something that fits.

353
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:16,127
Whose are these?

354
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:19,887
I don't know.
An old boyfriend.
Or a husband, maybe.

355
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:22,567
You've been locked up
for 5,000 years.

356
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,367
I have my needs.

357
00:27:25,927 --> 00:27:28,247
It's not like fidelity
was ever your strong suit.

358
00:27:31,967 --> 00:27:33,167
Oh, wow, okay.

359
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:37,327
Thanks for letting me
sit in, though.
That was really cool.

360
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:38,487
It's not a problem.

361
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:41,967
- I don't know, I just kind of thought you might like
to sit in on it.
- |Hey, um...

362
00:27:42,087 --> 00:27:45,007
I don't mean to be rude.
Can I just...
Can I catch up with you in,
like, one second?

363
00:27:45,007 --> 00:27:45,927
- Of course.|
- Sorry.

364
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:49,727
Excuse me.

365
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,767
I just wanted to apologize
for talking out of turn
back there.

366
00:27:55,607 --> 00:28:00,247
Not at all.
I admire your passion
on the subject,
Mr. Corbett.

367
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:01,727
- Correct?
- Yes. Yes.

368
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:05,247
Um, and thank you
for letting me sit in
on your class, Dr. Grasic.

369
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:09,007
So...
are you a religious zealot,

370
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:12,007
or just a die-hard
Milton fan?

371
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:15,167
Uh, neither.
Um, I've actually

372
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:17,967
- never read Paradise Lost.
- Shame on you.

373
00:28:20,087 --> 00:28:21,287
Anyway, I was thinking about

374
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:25,167
what you said about Lucifer
and his destiny,
and it goes against...

375
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,207
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I have
no time.

376
00:28:29,087 --> 00:28:32,647
But I spend
most of my evenings
at the library.

377
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:36,807
If you'd like to come by,
I'd be happy to continue
our discussion.

378
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,950
Hi.

379
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,870
Come here.

380
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,390
- How was work?
- It was great.

381
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,590
I didn't even have
to use my healing magic
on anyone today.

382
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,110
You use your healing magic
on the job?

383
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,270
- Aren't you worried about the Powers?
- Oh, I'm always worried about the Powers.

384
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,350
But if I have a chance
at saving a life, to me it's worth it.

385
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,470
Besides,
I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

386
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,070
It's a protective rune.

387
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:32,390
It's not strong enough
to mask a redemption
but

388
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,350
it's good for
a little interference.

389
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,150
You know, in a pinch.

390
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,590
Keep it.
I've got dozens of them.

391
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,150
Thanks.

392
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,950
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

393
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,430
What do you mean?

394
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,750
By redeeming the Fallen?

395
00:29:58,710 --> 00:29:59,510
I don't know.

396
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,350
What do you think?

397
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,030
I don't know.

398
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:10,630
Camael's always drilled it|into my head
that it's my destiny.

399
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,270
But just because
I'm meant to do something,
does that

400
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,550
make it
the right thing to do?

401
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:25,550
What if the Earth...
I don't know,
needs angels?

402
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,070
And I'm just...
taking them away?

403
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,550
Aaron...

404
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,950
this is your mission.

405
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,390
Now, whether
it's right or wrong
is for you to decide.

406
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,110
And I think,
until you know,

407
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,070
you should keep your gift
to yourself.

408
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,950
Because what you're doing
is far too important.

409
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,350
You have to believe|in it.

410
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,670
That's my two cents.

411
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,990
See your I.D.?

412
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:09,590
- Can you hold these?
- Yeah.

413
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,430
There you go.

414
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,550
- You got that?
- Yeah.

415
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:15,750
- You're 21?
- No, but my sister is.

416
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,670
One for you. Yep.

417
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:23,190
There you go.|Okay.
You guys ready?

418
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,230
Yeah!
Okay, let's do this!|Woo!
Yep!
Cheers.
Cheers.

419
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:35,230
Yo, aren't you drinking?

420
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,390
I'm not really much
of a drinker.

421
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,630
He's the designated driver.

422
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,030
Didn't you guys|walk here?
Yeah.

423
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,270
Don't you guys
have classes
in the morning?

424
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,430
Does that make
any difference? Class?|Class?

425
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,550
You guys...
Take one drink!
It's right there!|Come on!

426
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,390
One shot won't hurt you.|Man up.
You can't waste|alcohol, man. Man up.

427
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,430
Drink it.
Do it! Woo!
Leave it.
Yeah!

428
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,590
Just one shot!
He's got it|right there.
One shot. One shot.

429
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,710
Ooh, you're not
gonna puke, are you?

430
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,430
Okay, we're gonna
grab some air.

431
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:24,470
Ten bucks says
we don't see
either one of them
again tonight.

432
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,630
So, how was
your first day
of college?

433
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,630
It was great.
Thanks.

434
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,790
- Chloe.
- What is it?

435
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,990
Just...

436
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,670
You don't want
to get involved with me.

437
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,430
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

438
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,510
- Nothing.
- Then is something wrong with me?

439
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,470
'Cause I've been
practically throwing
myself at you all day.

440
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:47,590
Aaron!

441
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,710
No!

442
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,630
Wait, dude. Chill.

443
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:05,430
We were just
messing around.

444
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:07,950
Chloe.

Oh, Mr. Corbett.

455
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,390
- I wasn't sure
you'd still be here.
- The library doesn't close
until midnight.

456
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:38,430
The staff always
has to chase me out.

457
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,390
Yeah.

458
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,670
What can you tell me
about the Nephilim?

459
00:35:55,791 --> 00:36:00,711
It's widely accepted
that the Nephilim
were killed
in the Great Flood.

460
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:04,591
They were powerful beings,

461
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:07,951
very often portrayed
as giants.
Monsters.

462
00:36:09,391 --> 00:36:14,071
Have you ever...
heard of a Nephilim
called the Redeemer?

463
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:18,591
I have.

464
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:23,271
I'm surprised that
you know of him, though.

465
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:29,791
It's quite
an obscure prophecy.
Very controversial.

466
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,911
The Redeemer was a vehicle
for forgiveness.

467
00:36:36,631 --> 00:36:42,591
He or she has the power
to pardon anyone
of any sin,

468
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:44,631
no matter how great.

469
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:51,591
But there are clues
to something else
in the prophecy,

470
00:36:52,431 --> 00:36:58,111
hints that he may serve
another, darker purpose.

471
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:02,791
What purpose?
We don't know.

472
00:37:04,631 --> 00:37:09,271
All we know is
that for every claim
that praises his arrival,

473
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:14,551
there is another
that speaks of it
in terror.

474
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:19,591
We are not even sure
if he is a force of good...

475
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,031
or evil.

476
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:40,511
Aaron.

477
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:44,791
Ariel.

478
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:47,991
How you feeling?

479
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,391
Much better. Thank you.

480
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:02,151
I'm glad you're up.
I got called in to work,
and somebody's
gotta walk Gabriel.

481
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:05,951
Oh, and I promised him
some ice cream.

482
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,351
Where's Aaron?

483
00:38:09,471 --> 00:38:11,391
He's hanging with
his friends from college.

484
00:38:11,911 --> 00:38:13,351
His friends?
Mm-hmm.

485
00:38:15,951 --> 00:38:17,071
How long have I been out?

486
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:21,631
Don't worry.
He's fine.
You can't protect him
all the time, you know?

487
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:24,311
Yes, I can.
I must.

488
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:28,231
- He's an irresponsible child. And that temper will get someone...
- He's 19,

489
00:38:28,671 --> 00:38:31,271
he's a good kid,
and he needs some normalcy
in his life.

490
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:34,551
You gotta remember,
he's human.

491
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:38,711
Half human.
That's more than you are.

492
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:43,271
Who are you to talk?

493
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:48,591
The Nephilim are monsters.

494
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:51,551
Why?

495
00:38:53,151 --> 00:38:53,911
What did they do?

496
00:38:58,191 --> 00:38:58,951
What is that?

497
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:03,751
It's nothing.

498
00:39:05,631 --> 00:39:06,471
Where did you get it?

499
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:09,471
My friend gave it to me.

500
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,631
What are you doing?
I know what this is.

501
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,031
Protective rune
used to hide yourself.

502
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:23,031
To hide yourself?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

503
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:26,751
You hide yourself|from angels.

504
00:39:31,631 --> 00:39:35,511
Yes.
It all makes sense now.

505
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,031
I don't know what
you're talking about.

506
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:42,871
Of course you don't.
You never know
who might be listening.

507
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,311
But I know what you are.

508
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,591
And I'm just like you.
We are brothers, Aaron.

509
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,071
Brothers in the Order.

510
00:39:57,911 --> 00:40:00,471
The Order?
Yeah.

511
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:03,631
I know why you're here.

512
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,711
You do?|Yes.

513
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:12,231
We both know that
the angels are real.

514
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:18,151
We know that
they walk among us.

515
00:40:22,951 --> 00:40:27,151
Tell me...
would you like to see one?

516
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:29,511
Yes?

517
00:40:38,671 --> 00:40:40,231
All this
on a teacher's salary?

518
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:46,151
My family
has a long history
of dealing
in ancient artifacts.

519
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:56,471
What I'm about|to show you,

520
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:00,031
you can never
breathe a word about,
for your own safety.

521
00:41:05,271 --> 00:41:07,151
You have nothing
to fear from me.

522
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:12,111
But as I'm sure|you know,
some of our members

523
00:41:12,231 --> 00:41:13,831
are overly cautious.

524
00:41:17,591 --> 00:41:19,431
Do I have your word?

525
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:23,471
Come.

526
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,551
There she is.
Come.

527
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:45,431
Child?

528
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:49,231
We have a guest.

529
00:41:50,871 --> 00:41:52,871
Show us your wings.

530
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,271
Your beautiful wings.

531
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:15,911
Breathtaking...isn't it?

532
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:23,351
Now turn around.
Show us your pretty face.

533
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,831
Isn't she beautiful?

534
00:42:47,111 --> 00:42:47,911
Vilma!

535
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:56,478
How do you know her name?

536
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,198
That's impossible... what is she doing here?

537
00:43:00,398 --> 00:43:02,238
She's quite comfortable here.

538
00:43:02,638 --> 00:43:04,558
I've taken excellent care.

539
00:43:05,078 --> 00:43:06,198
She's a prisoner.

540
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,118
She's the only living Nephilim.

541
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:13,718
Would you rather her

542
00:43:13,798 --> 00:43:18,078
be strapped to a table in a laboratory somewhere?

543
00:43:19,518 --> 00:43:20,558
I'm taking her out of here.

544
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:21,838
No.

545
00:43:22,998 --> 00:43:24,598
You'll do no such thing

546
00:43:31,278 --> 00:43:34,158
It's time for you to leave my house.

547
00:43:39,238 --> 00:43:39,998
Right now.

548
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:42,878
Lukas...

549
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:46,438
God!

550
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,518
Those markings.

551
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:13,478
Wipe away those runes.

552
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:15,158
I don't want to.

553
00:44:15,238 --> 00:44:15,838
Do it.

554
00:44:19,478 --> 00:44:20,718
Do it now!

555
00:44:38,198 --> 00:44:40,918
You are... the Redeemer.

556
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,398
Wipe away those runes.

557
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:46,158
Do it!

558
00:44:55,678 --> 00:44:56,158
Vilma.

559
00:44:58,198 --> 00:44:58,798
It's me.

560
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:02,998
Vilma, it's Aaron.

561
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:05,278
We're going to get out of here.

562
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:16,758
It's okay.

563
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:17,918
You're safe now.

564
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:19,598
I promise.

565
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:11,878
You all right?

566
00:46:13,198 --> 00:46:13,638
Yeah.

567
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:14,998
Vilma, say something, please.

568
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:17,878
You're like me.

569
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:20,238
How is that possible?

570
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:21,398
I don't know.

571
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:22,878
I don't know what the hell's going on.

572
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:23,998
Aaron!

573
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:28,398
Camael. It's okay.

574
00:46:29,278 --> 00:46:30,678
This is Camael.
He's my friend.

575
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:32,118
Hey! I rember you.

576
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:33,198
This girl is Nephilim.

577
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:34,918
Where did she come from?

578
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:37,478
It's a long story.

579
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:39,038
You lost control.

580
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,718
The Powers are coming.
You must leave now.

581
00:46:43,038 --> 00:46:46,038
No. I'm going to stay,
and I'm going to fight.

582
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:49,638
If you don't leave now,
they will kill all of us.

583
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:51,638
And if I do, they'll kill you?

584
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:54,758
I have pledged to lay down my life for you.

585
00:46:55,238 --> 00:46:56,518
That is what I intend to do.

586
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:57,758
What is going on?

587
00:46:59,038 --> 00:47:02,118
Aaron, you must protect
this child, as you once
need my help.

588
00:47:03,678 --> 00:47:04,238
Run!

589
00:47:12,118 --> 00:47:13,238
Take care of the traitor.

590
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:14,918
I'm going after the Nephilim.

591
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,198
Well, I'll be damned.

592
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,678
Two for the price of one.
It must be my lucky day.

593
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:00,798
I got to admit, kid.

594
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:02,998
You gave us a run for our money.

595
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,518
But this is how it ends.

596
00:48:12,118 --> 00:48:13,998
Leave the children alone, Nathaniel.

597
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:16,118
Azazel.

598
00:48:18,558 --> 00:48:20,798
Don't you have some puppies to go kick or something?

599
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:24,238
This can't be you.
This isn't real.

600
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:25,678
Oh, it's real.

601
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:30,038
What could I possibly do to convince you?

602
00:48:33,318 --> 00:48:35,078
Oh. Aren't I?

603
00:48:52,278 --> 00:48:53,038
You guys all right?

604
00:48:55,798 --> 00:48:56,878
What, are you scared of me?

605
00:48:57,718 --> 00:48:58,838
I just saved your asses.

606
00:49:32,838 --> 00:49:33,358
Who are you?

607
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:34,718
I'm Azazel.

608
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:36,758
Glad to meet you.

609
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:39,718
Are you one of the Fallen?

610
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:41,318
I'm Azazel.

611
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:43,318
You never heard of me?

612
00:49:44,758 --> 00:49:46,478
Yeah, I'm one of the Fallen.
I'm the Fallen.

613
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:50,718
Your girl looks a little
freaked out, man.

614
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:53,798
Yeah, well,
it's been a rough night.

615
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:56,558
Yeah, well you know what?
It's only going to get worse.

616
00:49:56,638 --> 00:49:58,918
We need to get off these streets,
go underground. Let's go.

617
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:05,558
Let's go! They can smell you.
They can feel you. Come on.

618
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:07,678
We got to go.

619
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,598
Aaron. He just killed that man.

620
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,838
Vilma, I know what you're
going through right now.

621
00:50:13,158 --> 00:50:15,318
But he's one of the Fallen.
He's on our side.

622
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:16,358
On our side?

623
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:19,358
Whose side are we on?
Are we the good guys
or the bad guys?

624
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:25,078
If we survive this night, I promise you
I will tell you everything I know.

625
00:50:26,038 --> 00:50:27,198
But right now,
we've got to go.

626
00:50:28,198 --> 00:50:28,598
Okay?

627
00:50:30,158 --> 00:50:30,958
- Yeah.
- Okay.

628
00:50:49,518 --> 00:50:50,678
Hey, could I ask
you something?

629
00:50:53,638 --> 00:50:56,838
How did you end up
in that nutjob's attic?

630
00:51:00,238 --> 00:51:02,118
Well, it all started
on my 18th birthday.

631
00:51:03,718 --> 00:51:06,078
Strange things started
happening to me.

632
00:51:07,078 --> 00:51:08,478
I was getting these headaches,

633
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:10,638
and I was hearing voices.

634
00:51:12,998 --> 00:51:15,638
And then...
And the angels came.

635
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,358
They're so majestic
at first, you know.

636
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:20,878
So beautiful.

637
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:23,438
Real angels from Heaven.

638
00:51:26,158 --> 00:51:27,038
Then they attacked.

639
00:51:30,038 --> 00:51:31,238
They killed my aunt.

640
00:51:32,598 --> 00:51:33,518
Burned down the house.

641
00:51:34,878 --> 00:51:36,118
Somehow, I got away.

642
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:38,678
The angels who did that
to you,

643
00:51:39,598 --> 00:51:40,878
they're calledthe Powers.

644
00:51:42,758 --> 00:51:44,198
They are the same angels

645
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:47,598
that are chasing us right now.

646
00:51:48,078 --> 00:51:50,158
I just ran.
Hid in the woods.

647
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,118
I thought I was dead,
for sure.

648
00:51:53,478 --> 00:51:57,238
I stopped this man in the woods
and asked him for help, but...

649
00:51:57,678 --> 00:52:00,838
he pulled out a gun
and shot me with a tranquilizer.

650
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,718
Lukas didn't hurt me or
anything, though, he, uh...

651
00:52:05,958 --> 00:52:06,918
He was kind.

652
00:52:08,758 --> 00:52:11,878
You probably won't understand.
It's not like I had anywhere else to go.

653
00:52:14,238 --> 00:52:15,238
Until you came.

654
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:20,038
So, thanks for coming
to my rescue.

655
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,078
Maybe you can tell me now why angels
are trying to kill us?

656
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:26,278
What did we do?

657
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:29,118
It's because we were
born Nephilim.

658
00:52:30,478 --> 00:52:33,678
They're on a mission from
the Creator to cleanse
the Earth of...

659
00:52:34,078 --> 00:52:36,958
our kind.
We're abominations.

660
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:39,678
Abominations.

661
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:43,518
Yeah, you're freaks. It sucks.
Can we all stop feeling sorry for ourselves now?

662
00:52:43,918 --> 00:52:44,678
We're alive,

663
00:52:45,638 --> 00:52:47,278
which is more than can
be said for Nathaniel.

664
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:48,878
Hey, listen. Um...

665
00:52:49,678 --> 00:52:51,918
I want to thank you
for what you did back there.

666
00:52:52,198 --> 00:52:53,398
If you hadn't shown up,
we might have been...

667
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,358
Hey.
You're the Redeemer.

668
00:52:55,598 --> 00:52:57,678
What kind of Fallen would I be
if I didn't look out for you?

669
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:02,278
Hey, we got to find out
what happened to Camael.

670
00:53:03,478 --> 00:53:05,558
Camael? Ah, I wouldn't
worry about him.

671
00:53:06,838 --> 00:53:07,318
What do you mean?

672
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:09,078
Camael's dead.

673
00:53:19,832 --> 00:53:21,752
I can't believe
Camael's dead.

674
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:29,552
What is the big deal?

675
00:53:30,432 --> 00:53:33,232
So Camael's troops finally turned on him.
That's a good thing.

676
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,672
He wasn't with the Powers anymore.
He...

677
00:53:39,112 --> 00:53:40,752
He's been protecting me,

678
00:53:41,592 --> 00:53:42,912
ever since I turned.

679
00:53:46,112 --> 00:53:47,592
He was my friend.

680
00:53:48,432 --> 00:53:49,352
Your friend?

681
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:51,992
We are talking about
the same Camael, right?

682
00:53:51,992 --> 00:53:53,512
Tall, bald,
no sense of humor?

683
00:54:02,512 --> 00:54:03,912
This is all my fault.

684
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:06,792
No, Aaron,

685
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:08,552
you were trying
to help me.

686
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,872
That's what Camael
would've wanted.

687
00:54:12,352 --> 00:54:13,872
I didn't have to
do it like that.

688
00:54:16,272 --> 00:54:17,552
I lost control.

689
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,992
And I don't know
what we're going
to do now.

690
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,072
Look, I've got an idea.

691
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:32,792
Why don't we get
out of town?

692
00:54:34,072 --> 00:54:35,192
Lay low for a while.

693
00:54:36,672 --> 00:54:38,432
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

694
00:54:40,192 --> 00:54:40,832
Where is that?

695
00:54:43,272 --> 00:54:45,592
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

696
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:50,792
It's about time
you met him.

697
00:55:05,752 --> 00:55:08,312
Hey!
Don't move!
Stay right there!

698
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:09,352
Don't move!

699
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:11,592
Get back here!

700
00:55:11,992 --> 00:55:13,712
Come back here and get down on your knees!

701
00:55:14,072 --> 00:55:15,672
Give me your wallet.
Your wallet! All right.

702
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:17,112
Hurry up!
All right!

703
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:19,952
And your watch.
Your watch, too!
Hurry!
Come on!

704
00:55:38,472 --> 00:55:41,152
It's not nice
to steal from people.

705
00:55:50,152 --> 00:55:50,552
Hey.

706
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:52,992
What is wrong with you?

707
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:54,512
It's kinda harsh, isn't it?

708
00:55:56,992 --> 00:55:58,632
I'm not a guardian angel.

709
00:56:00,032 --> 00:56:01,632
I'm an avenging angel.

710
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:03,552
This is who I am.

711
00:56:05,032 --> 00:56:06,152
The world needs both.

712
00:56:08,152 --> 00:56:10,152
Got us a car.
Wanna drive?

713
00:56:12,392 --> 00:56:14,552
We're not seriously going
off with this guy, are we?

714
00:56:17,952 --> 00:56:19,192
He can protect us.

715
00:56:20,632 --> 00:56:21,352
We need him.

716
00:56:22,632 --> 00:56:23,912
We need somebody.

717
00:56:25,952 --> 00:56:26,832
Any day now.

718
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:33,112
Just hold on.

719
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:40,352
What is the Light Bringer?

720
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:42,112
Not what. Who.

721
00:56:42,712 --> 00:56:44,352
He's a fallen angel,
just like me.

722
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:47,792
And his name
is the Light Bringer?

723
00:56:48,032 --> 00:56:49,112
Is your name the Redeemer?

724
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:50,432
Don't be an idiot.

725
00:56:52,512 --> 00:56:54,912
He doesn't have a name
in a traditional sense.

726
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,912
We call him "the Light Bringer"
because that's what he does.

727
00:56:58,112 --> 00:57:02,112
He brings us light.
He's an oracle. He's a seer.

728
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:05,232
Are you sure
that he can help us?

729
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:08,552
He can't help me,
but he can help you.

730
00:57:09,232 --> 00:57:11,752
Remember that prophecY about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

731
00:57:14,152 --> 00:57:14,912
He wrote it.

732
00:57:43,032 --> 00:57:45,072
You'll find that
quite impossible, traitor.

733
00:57:50,272 --> 00:57:50,992
Aaron?

734
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:55,432
I suspect we'll have him
or his remains within the hour.

735
00:57:56,752 --> 00:57:59,192
He can't last long
without your protection.

736
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:02,512
Mazarin.

737
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:07,632
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

738
00:58:09,192 --> 00:58:11,072
The prophecy is real.

739
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:14,032
No, Camael.
It's a lie.

740
00:58:15,512 --> 00:58:17,992
I do hope Nathaniel
brings the boy back alive.

741
00:58:19,152 --> 00:58:21,552
I'd love to make you watch
while I slit his throat

742
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,552
so that when you die,

743
00:58:24,272 --> 00:58:26,872
you'll know for certain
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

744
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:31,752
Mazarin.

745
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:35,752
This is not what
the Powers stand for.

746
00:58:36,632 --> 00:58:39,552
You dare tell me
the Powers' mission?

747
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:42,992
Are you under the misconception
that you're still one of us?

748
00:58:43,472 --> 00:58:46,832
You turned your back on us, Camael.
You turned your back on the Creator.

749
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:50,112
And you'll pay
for your sins, traitor.

750
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:57,552
What I want to know is...

751
00:58:59,192 --> 00:59:03,072
what in the hell were you thinking
showing her to anyone?

752
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:05,912
But he was Nephilim.

753
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:10,272
You didn't know that
when you brought him
up here, did you?

754
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,752
I thought
he was one of us.

755
00:59:13,152 --> 00:59:16,072
Oh, right.
Of course.

756
00:59:17,832 --> 00:59:21,872
Because the Order is just teeming
with teenage members, isn't it?

757
00:59:24,112 --> 00:59:25,912
Please, put that down.

758
00:59:27,072 --> 00:59:28,912
It's 4th century.

759
00:59:29,072 --> 00:59:30,232
Really?

760
00:59:31,352 --> 00:59:32,552
It's exquisite.

761
00:59:38,112 --> 00:59:41,352
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that precious to you?

762
00:59:42,432 --> 00:59:43,592
What about this?

763
00:59:46,872 --> 00:59:49,152
Haven't I lost
enough tonight?

764
00:59:50,752 --> 00:59:53,592
It's not about what you've lost,
Dr. Grasic.

765
00:59:54,352 --> 00:59:57,032
You've lost nothing.
We let you keep her.

766
00:59:58,232 --> 00:59:59,752
She was never yours.He's the Redeemer!

767
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:05,712
What?

768
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:07,432
Yes.

769
01:00:15,232 --> 01:00:17,632
The boy who freed her...

770
01:00:20,352 --> 01:00:24,352
he has the markings
of the Redeemer.

771
01:00:36,592 --> 01:00:38,352
Start from the beginning.

772
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:43,592
Is that look in your eye
meant to intimidate me?

773
01:00:45,992 --> 01:00:48,712
Now, I admit there was a time
when it might have,

774
01:00:49,992 --> 01:00:51,672
but those days are over,
old friend.

775
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:53,752
Mazarin.

776
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:55,592
What is it, Sachael?

777
01:00:56,512 --> 01:00:57,632
It's Nathaniel.

778
01:01:09,872 --> 01:01:13,432
He's not coming back.
He's dead.

779
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,672
That half-breed
killed Nathaniel?

780
01:01:18,672 --> 01:01:19,832
Somebody did.

781
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:33,632
Where is he now, Camael?
Tell me.

782
01:01:38,912 --> 01:01:41,672
You know,
over the millennia
we served together,

783
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,592
many of the Fallen
said they would never
give up their children.

784
01:01:46,792 --> 01:01:50,272
But they always did,
thanks to us.

785
01:01:51,512 --> 01:01:52,752
No, thanks to you.

786
01:01:54,832 --> 01:01:56,192
Where is the Nephilim?

787
01:02:29,173 --> 01:02:31,573
So who is this
Jesus character anyway?

788
01:02:34,693 --> 01:02:36,453
Seriously, I've been
seeing his name everywhere.

789
01:02:41,693 --> 01:02:47,253
Well, um, a lot of people
think that he was the son of God.

790
01:02:52,373 --> 01:02:53,213
What's so funny?

791
01:02:55,493 --> 01:02:57,413
The Creator had a kid.

792
01:02:58,093 --> 01:02:59,973
Well, do as I say,
not as I do, eh?

793
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:02,453
Did you seriously
not know that?

794
01:03:04,613 --> 01:03:06,213
Been out of the picture
for a while.

795
01:03:09,493 --> 01:03:10,213
How so?

796
01:03:11,493 --> 01:03:13,613
Well, you probably heard
about what happened
in the old days.

797
01:03:14,013 --> 01:03:17,013
About how the Creator
flooded the planet
because we contaminated

798
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:19,093
his precious Earth
with half-breeds like you.

799
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:21,453
A bit of an overreaction,
if you ask me.

800
01:03:21,493 --> 01:03:23,613
But, hey, mysterious ways
and all that.

801
01:03:24,573 --> 01:03:27,653
Wait. You mean,
like, Noah's Ark?

802
01:03:28,573 --> 01:03:29,253
That flood?

803
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:30,733
Yeah, that's right.

804
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:31,973
Noah.

805
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:35,853
That guy could
really throw it down,
let me tell you.

806
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:38,533
Anyways.

807
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:42,933
Afterwards, your buddy Camael

808
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,533
and a few other half-wits
from the Powers

809
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:48,053
decided they were going
to come down and tell us
things had to change.

810
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,533
I guess to prove
a point,

811
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,373
they decided to make
an example of someone.

812
01:03:56,093 --> 01:03:57,093
I fought.

813
01:03:59,173 --> 01:04:00,453
Killed one of them.

814
01:04:01,413 --> 01:04:04,053
Slashed this son of a bitch
Mazarin across the face.

815
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:05,373
It was beautiful.

816
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,413
But in the end,

817
01:04:09,253 --> 01:04:10,133
they got me.

818
01:04:12,253 --> 01:04:14,013
Took me deep underground,

819
01:04:14,573 --> 01:04:15,573
chained me up,

820
01:04:16,493 --> 01:04:19,413
and left me for 5,000 years.

821
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:23,173
So you've been a prisoner, too.
Like me.

822
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:25,653
Yeah.

823
01:04:28,013 --> 01:04:30,213
Six months
in a luxury suite...

824
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:33,853
just like being chained
to a stone slab
for five millennia.

825
01:04:34,373 --> 01:04:35,453
Just like it.

826
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,573
Don't talk to her
like that.

827
01:04:38,973 --> 01:04:39,573
Or what?

828
01:04:45,093 --> 01:04:46,653
I'm just messin'
with you, kid.

829
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:47,973
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

830
01:04:48,253 --> 01:04:50,533
I'm sure it must've been
very difficult for you.

831
01:04:52,373 --> 01:04:53,173
I smell food.

832
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:54,373
What about food?

833
01:04:54,573 --> 01:04:56,013
Who wants to eat?
Want to stop for a bite?

834
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:58,293
Well, we're kind of
on the run right now.

835
01:04:58,413 --> 01:04:58,973
You gotta eat.

836
01:04:59,973 --> 01:05:02,093
I'm hungry. Who's hungry?
Let's vote.

837
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:03,893
Me! I'm hungry!

838
01:05:04,293 --> 01:05:05,173
Me, too.

839
01:05:06,093 --> 01:05:07,093
I'm starving.

840
01:05:08,493 --> 01:05:09,773
Looks like you lose, chief.

841
01:05:17,773 --> 01:05:19,093
All right, order up.

842
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:21,893
Oh... my... God.

843
01:05:26,693 --> 01:05:28,213
What are these things
called again?

844
01:05:29,613 --> 01:05:32,373
What?
French fries?

845
01:05:33,253 --> 01:05:35,013
French fries.
I gotta remember that.

846
01:05:35,613 --> 01:05:38,213
Here, try 'em with ketchup.

847
01:05:49,813 --> 01:05:54,773
This is the best food
I've ever had
in the history of ever!

848
01:05:54,853 --> 01:05:57,373
Hey, we get it.
You like French fries.

849
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:01,533
This is the first meal
I've had in a long time.

850
01:06:01,613 --> 01:06:04,693
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna enjoy it.
All right?

851
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:08,013
And lighten up...
Redeemer.

852
01:06:10,293 --> 01:06:12,893
Why does he keep
calling you that?
Redeemer?

853
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:14,253
'Cause that's what he is.

854
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:17,773
He sends us Fallen
back to Heaven.
Show her your arms.

855
01:06:19,613 --> 01:06:20,813
Show her your arms.

856
01:06:28,333 --> 01:06:30,093
The names of the Redeemed.

857
01:06:34,373 --> 01:06:35,653
These are all angels?

858
01:06:37,253 --> 01:06:38,933
And you send them
back to Heaven?

859
01:06:40,733 --> 01:06:41,653
How?

860
01:06:43,693 --> 01:06:44,613
I don't know.

861
01:06:47,053 --> 01:06:50,733
Um... When I'm around them,
I get this, um...

862
01:06:51,933 --> 01:06:54,133
this weird feeling.

863
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,133
It's hard to explain, really.
Um...

864
01:06:58,853 --> 01:06:59,893
I kinda...

865
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,533
open myself up to them.

866
01:07:05,893 --> 01:07:09,773
And then I usually...
take their hand and, uh...

867
01:07:12,573 --> 01:07:14,853
this weird energy
passes between us.

868
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:21,653
And then they're gone.

869
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:28,373
Wow. Um...

870
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:30,533
Do it to him.

871
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,693
What?
No, you keep that voodoo to yourself.

872
01:07:34,173 --> 01:07:35,573
Don't you want
to go to Heaven?

873
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:36,733
Hell, no.

874
01:07:37,213 --> 01:07:39,773
If I liked it,
I wouldn't have rebelled
in the first place,
would I?

875
01:07:41,573 --> 01:07:43,813
Yeah, well, I'm not
really doing it anymore.

876
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:46,933
Not right now.

877
01:07:48,253 --> 01:07:49,253
Why not?

878
01:07:49,373 --> 01:07:52,893
There's just a lot I...
I still don't understand about it.

879
01:07:55,373 --> 01:07:57,733
Plus, I'm not even sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

880
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:02,733
Aaron, how can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

881
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:05,293
I don't know.

882
01:08:08,413 --> 01:08:10,013
But I've been having these...

883
01:08:11,733 --> 01:08:13,813
these weird dreams lately

884
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:16,613
about the end
of the world...

885
01:08:20,693 --> 01:08:21,853
and I'm the cause of it.

886
01:08:24,093 --> 01:08:26,133
Damn, kid, you're a mess,
ain't you?

887
01:08:29,213 --> 01:08:30,053
Look at me.

888
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:34,973
Look at me.
When we get
to the Light Bringer,

889
01:08:35,133 --> 01:08:39,093
I promise you'll understand
yourself and your destiny

890
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:41,213
a hell of a lot better.

891
01:08:42,973 --> 01:08:43,893
More coffee?

892
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:47,613
Hello, sweetheart.
What's your name?

893
01:08:49,413 --> 01:08:50,493
Suzie.

894
01:08:51,253 --> 01:08:54,493
Suzie.
That's such a pretty name.

895
01:08:55,813 --> 01:08:57,413
Saw you looking
at me earlier, Suzie.

896
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:01,613
No, no. Don't be embarrassed.
Sometimes I can't stop looking at me.

897
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,173
Let me ask you
a question, Suzie.

898
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,573
Is there anywhere near here

899
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:13,413
where you and I
could go, um...

900
01:09:14,653 --> 01:09:15,413
talk?

901
01:09:22,653 --> 01:09:24,253
I'm going on a break.

902
01:09:24,573 --> 01:09:25,813
Yeah, all right.

903
01:09:28,173 --> 01:09:30,093
Catch you losers later.

904
01:09:58,373 --> 01:10:00,973
I've told you
everything I know.

905
01:10:09,173 --> 01:10:10,013
Hawkins.

906
01:10:11,613 --> 01:10:13,453
No. No teams.

907
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:15,293
I hunt alone.

908
01:10:21,813 --> 01:10:23,493
What do you want me
to do about the girl?

909
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:27,653
Understood.

910
01:10:43,173 --> 01:10:46,093
Are you going to get
my Vilma back?

911
01:10:56,733 --> 01:10:57,533
Go on.

912
01:10:58,413 --> 01:10:59,733
I don't care.

913
01:11:01,933 --> 01:11:04,893
I don't want to live
without her anyway.

914
01:11:13,888 --> 01:11:16,008
Do you believe
that things happen
for a reason?

915
01:11:18,568 --> 01:11:19,528
You mean, like fate?

916
01:11:20,848 --> 01:11:23,968
There's really
no other explanation
for all this, is there?

917
01:11:24,888 --> 01:11:26,128
You and me?

918
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:30,248
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

919
01:11:35,728 --> 01:11:38,488
Everything makes
so much sense now.

920
01:11:38,608 --> 01:11:42,568
The day you left,
people said you'd gone crazy

921
01:11:42,768 --> 01:11:44,808
- and burned your house down.
- People said that?

922
01:11:45,808 --> 01:11:46,688
About me?

923
01:11:57,928 --> 01:11:59,608
You ever think
about going home?

924
01:12:01,928 --> 01:12:02,928
Yeah.

925
01:12:04,288 --> 01:12:05,368
All the time.

926
01:12:07,688 --> 01:12:10,168
It's been a year now
and I just...

927
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:15,808
I feel like I keep getting
further and further away.
You know?

928
01:12:16,568 --> 01:12:20,008
At least you have a family to go back to.
Someday.

929
01:12:23,368 --> 01:12:26,248
I wonder if this Light Bringer
knows anything about me.

930
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:30,968
You know, maybe...
maybe I have a prophecy, too.

931
01:12:32,568 --> 01:12:34,048
Don't jinx yourself.

932
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:35,648
Still got it.

933
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,048
It's almost too easy,
isn't it?

934
01:12:42,128 --> 01:12:44,688
Mortal wenches.
God bless 'em.

935
01:12:45,328 --> 01:12:48,488
You know, you really
shouldn't say that stuff.

936
01:12:49,488 --> 01:12:50,088
Why?

937
01:12:51,248 --> 01:12:53,368
Because it's derogatory
towards women.

938
01:12:55,248 --> 01:12:57,288
No, but I'm saying that
I like that they're easy.

939
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:00,688
Weird.

940
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:03,128
You kids ready to go?

941
01:13:05,088 --> 01:13:05,888
Come on, Gabe.

942
01:13:07,168 --> 01:13:08,968
I'm riding in back
with Azazel.

943
01:13:13,328 --> 01:13:14,048
What is it?

944
01:13:17,248 --> 01:13:19,288
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head over.

945
01:13:20,248 --> 01:13:21,368
Let's go.

946
01:13:37,088 --> 01:13:40,008
The aerospace manufacturer
pleaded guilty to two counts

947
01:13:40,088 --> 01:13:42,008
of violating the Federal
Clean Water Act,

948
01:13:42,008 --> 01:13:44,688
admitting dumping
industrial discharge
into the river.

949
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:47,568
In addition to being placed
on probation for five years,

950
01:13:47,608 --> 01:13:50,208
the company agreed to pay
$1 million in fines

951
01:13:50,248 --> 01:13:53,248
and to contribute
another $11 million
for environmental
improvement projects.

952
01:13:53,288 --> 01:13:55,928
Good God,
what is happening
to this place?

953
01:13:56,048 --> 01:13:58,968
Human beings used to care
about the Earth, you know?

954
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:01,368
They used to appreciate
just how good they had it.

955
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:04,168
Guess a lot has changed
in 5,000 years.

956
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:13,568
Will this Light Bringer
know who my father is?

957
01:14:15,288 --> 01:14:16,888
You sure that's something
you want to find out?

958
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:20,928
Most Nephilim don't
want anything to do
with their fathers.

959
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:24,088
Human women can't
survive the births.

960
01:14:25,648 --> 01:14:28,248
At first, we were like,
whoops, you know?

961
01:14:28,648 --> 01:14:30,768
But it didn't take us long
to figure out that, you know,

962
01:14:30,968 --> 01:14:34,008
getting one pregnant
was like handing down
a death sentence.

963
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:37,328
So they all die?
All our mothers?

964
01:14:38,008 --> 01:14:39,328
Every one of 'em.

965
01:14:41,288 --> 01:14:43,608
Your old man still sound
like someone you wanna
go fishing with?

966
01:14:44,288 --> 01:14:45,648
Play catch?

967
01:14:45,768 --> 01:14:47,168
I just want to know
who he is.

968
01:14:50,008 --> 01:14:51,088
We're being followed.

969
01:14:51,168 --> 01:14:51,888
What?

970
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:54,288
By who?

971
01:14:54,888 --> 01:14:55,848
I don't know.

972
01:14:56,408 --> 01:14:58,328
Pull over.
Let me deal with it.

973
01:15:02,328 --> 01:15:03,808
It's time, traitor.

974
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:07,088
Time for you to say good-bye
to something you hold dear.

975
01:15:10,328 --> 01:15:11,888
Perhaps your eyes.

976
01:15:12,968 --> 01:15:16,408
No. There's a certain
nobility in blindness.

977
01:15:17,208 --> 01:15:20,608
I could cut out your tongue,
but then once you're broken,

978
01:15:21,008 --> 01:15:23,448
you wouldn't
be able to tell me
what I want to know.

979
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:25,528
Sachael.

980
01:15:26,448 --> 01:15:27,688
I want to see his wings.

981
01:15:27,728 --> 01:15:29,208
Mazarin, no.
You can't...

982
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:30,248
That wasn't a request.

983
01:15:31,328 --> 01:15:32,088
Just do it.

984
01:15:34,408 --> 01:15:35,088
Mazarin.

985
01:15:36,728 --> 01:15:38,248
You are lost.

986
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:43,168
You do not serve
the Creator.

987
01:15:49,368 --> 01:15:50,328
Mazarin.

988
01:16:05,608 --> 01:16:06,688
Mazarin.

989
01:16:10,448 --> 01:16:12,248
You are the one who's lost.

990
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:13,968
And as for the Creator...

991
01:16:14,848 --> 01:16:17,848
what I do now,
I do in his name.

992
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:28,968
And now, you take
your true place
amongst the Fallen.

993
01:16:52,684 --> 01:16:53,804
Looking for something?

994
01:16:55,604 --> 01:16:56,524
Anane.

995
01:17:02,724 --> 01:17:04,564
I picked up your scent
just outside of town,

996
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:06,884
and I've been following you
ever since.

997
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:11,204
How did you escape?

998
01:17:12,204 --> 01:17:14,324
I am so sick of everybody
asking me that question.

999
01:17:14,324 --> 01:17:15,364
Maybe I didn't escape.

1000
01:17:15,964 --> 01:17:19,204
Maybe the Creator decided
I was such a perfect specimen
he'd set me free.

1001
01:17:19,844 --> 01:17:20,604
Did he?

1002
01:17:22,524 --> 01:17:24,444
That's not the point.
What do you want?

1003
01:17:25,964 --> 01:17:27,724
I want to know
if I'm worthy
of redemption.

1004
01:17:28,284 --> 01:17:31,004
I can tell that
you want it really bad.

1005
01:17:32,364 --> 01:17:34,924
But I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that right now.

1006
01:17:37,964 --> 01:17:38,764
I see.

1007
01:17:40,804 --> 01:17:42,364
It's nothing personal, okay?

1008
01:17:42,484 --> 01:17:43,244
I just...

1009
01:17:45,844 --> 01:17:47,564
I don't know
how much time
I have left.

1010
01:17:52,324 --> 01:17:53,644
Nathaniel did this to me.

1011
01:17:54,844 --> 01:17:56,004
He was looking for you.

1012
01:18:00,124 --> 01:18:01,724
It's too late for me
to be healed.

1013
01:18:02,484 --> 01:18:05,084
The wound is too old,
too deep.

1014
01:18:06,084 --> 01:18:07,364
It's killing me.

1015
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:11,124
You know what happens
to angels when they die
without redemption?

1016
01:18:12,084 --> 01:18:15,164
We don't have souls.
Not like you do.

1017
01:18:16,764 --> 01:18:18,924
There's...
There's no Heaven for us.

1018
01:18:19,484 --> 01:18:20,804
No Hell.
Just...

1019
01:18:21,804 --> 01:18:23,084
Just nothingness.

1020
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:25,244
Forever.

1021
01:18:28,324 --> 01:18:30,244
And that scares me
more than anything.

1022
01:18:30,964 --> 01:18:32,684
Yeah, well,
tough luck, Anane.

1023
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:34,844
Welcome to the yawning
abyss of oblivion.

1024
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:46,884
Aaron.

1025
01:18:48,444 --> 01:18:51,364
You have to help him.
Please?

1026
01:18:52,884 --> 01:18:54,164
I want to.

1027
01:18:55,724 --> 01:18:57,764
I really do.
It's just that...

1028
01:18:58,724 --> 01:19:01,604
Ariel told me not to
until I know
it's the right thing.

1029
01:19:03,204 --> 01:19:06,244
He wants to go back to Heaven
and you can do that for him.

1030
01:19:07,364 --> 01:19:09,044
How can you refuse?

1031
01:19:09,564 --> 01:19:12,044
Look in your heart.
You know it's right.

1032
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:19,884
Wait a second.
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

1033
01:19:21,404 --> 01:19:24,204
With that amount of energy,
you're just going to call
the Powers right to us.

1034
01:19:24,404 --> 01:19:25,404
I know that.

1035
01:19:29,004 --> 01:19:31,124
But Vilma's right.
I can't just...

1036
01:19:31,884 --> 01:19:33,044
let him die.

1037
01:19:34,084 --> 01:19:35,604
Aaron, don't.

1038
01:19:46,804 --> 01:19:47,884
You ready?

1039
01:19:50,964 --> 01:19:51,924
Yeah.

1040
01:20:25,324 --> 01:20:26,804
Stay with the traitor.

1041
01:20:27,044 --> 01:20:27,964
Sachael.

1042
01:20:38,604 --> 01:20:39,884
You.

1043
01:20:41,924 --> 01:20:43,244
I need your help.

1044
01:20:57,564 --> 01:20:59,324
Fantastic!

1045
01:21:00,684 --> 01:21:03,284
You are a genius
of epic proportions,
my friend.

1046
01:21:04,004 --> 01:21:05,844
That was great. Yeah.
'Cause, uh...

1047
01:21:06,044 --> 01:21:07,324
we got away

1048
01:21:08,044 --> 01:21:09,724
and it was plain sailing
the whole time.

1049
01:21:09,844 --> 01:21:13,324
But now it's brilliant
because they know
exactly where we are.

1050
01:21:13,644 --> 01:21:15,484
I'm really proud of you.
Well done.

1051
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:17,764
Look, just shut up,
all right?

1052
01:21:17,924 --> 01:21:19,804
Hey, I'm trying
to look out for you.

1053
01:21:20,684 --> 01:21:21,764
Trying to keep you alive.

1054
01:21:21,804 --> 01:21:24,364
The rest of the Fallen
will be plenty pissed with me

1055
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:25,964
if you died on my watch.

1056
01:21:27,204 --> 01:21:28,324
I'm just saying...

1057
01:21:29,484 --> 01:21:31,084
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.

1058
01:21:32,004 --> 01:21:32,484
You?

1059
01:21:34,244 --> 01:21:35,644
I'm not afraid of anything.

1060
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:38,644
Well, that's good.

1061
01:21:41,004 --> 01:21:42,284
Because here they come.

1062
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,884
I'm gonna put
an end to this.

1063
01:21:49,964 --> 01:21:51,484
I'm not running
from them anymore.

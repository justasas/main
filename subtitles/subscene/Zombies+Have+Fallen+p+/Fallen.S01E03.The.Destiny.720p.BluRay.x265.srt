1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,280
<i>Previously on</i> Fallen...

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,400
Show us your wings
your beautiful wings.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,270
I'm taking her out of here.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,610
I'm not even sure if
I'm doing the right thing.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,570
How can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,850
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,290
The prophecy is real.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,950
As the prophecy has foretold
a Nephilim has been born

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,110
with the power to return
fallen angels to Heaven.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,800
I need you to help him
fulfill his destiny.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,450
Who are you?
I'm Azazel.

13
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,490
Where is the Nephilim?

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,110
Camael's dead.

15
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,860
Why don't we get
out of town?

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,440
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

17
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,010
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

18
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,040
What is the Light Bringer?
Not what. Who.

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,770
Remember that prophecy about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

20
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,530
He wrote it.

21
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,790
- He's the Redeemer!
- What?

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,560
Do it. I don't want to
live without her anyway.

23
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,760
When God created Man a jealous Lucifer
mounted a great rebellion|in Heaven.

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,910
His army of angels was defeated
and forever banished from Paradise.

25
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,630
These angels the Fallen
abandoned Lucifer

26
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,520
choosing to live on Earth
among the pleasures of humans.

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,990
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations...

28
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,790
children called Nephilim.

29
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,840
They have the powers|of angels
but the souls of men.

30
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,470
Angry the Creator flooded the Earth

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,300
killing the Nephilim and
driving the Fallen into hiding.

32
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,360
He sent the Powers fierce warrior angels
to hunt those that survived the Flood.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,350
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy:

34
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,580
A Nephilim would be born
who would redeem them

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,680
So the fallen watched...

36
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,380
and waited.

37
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,540
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.You?

38
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm not afraid
of anything.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,670
I'm going to put
an end to this.
I'm not running
from them anymore.

40
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,360
Nephilim...
you face warriors of Heaven.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,030
We fought in the greatest war
in the history of creation...
and won.

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,340
Do you really think
you stand a chance against us?

43
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,810
Hello Mazarin.

44
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,480
So who wants
to die first?

45
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,240
This can't be.

46
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,350
That's exactly what Nathaniel said moments
before I was dusting him off my boots.

47
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,950
Your uh scar's healing up.
Looks good... ish.

48
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,230
It is our mission to cleanse
the Earth of your kind

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,680
and those that spawned you.
We will not abandon it.

50
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,530
We don't have to fight.
Just turn around and leave.

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,170
- If you do that no one has to die.
- Oh come on. Someone always has to die.

52
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,360
That's part of the fun.

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,310
Kill him.

54
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,040
Kill him!

55
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,030
I yield.

56
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,600
Duly noted.

57
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,210
What the hell
did you just do?

58
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,810
- He yielded.
- And?

59
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,950
There's a line that
I'm not going to cross.

60
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,520
And as long as you're with me
you're not going to cross it either.

61
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,980
I'm not with you.
You're with me.

62
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:20,260
Listen to me. This Light Bringer
he better be everything that you promised

63
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,340
because I am running out of reasons
to hang around you.

64
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,890
Let go of me.
Come on.

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,030
The Light Bringer knows
everything about you Aaron.

66
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,610
Who you are where you came from.
You can learn it all.

67
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,780
We just have to get to him first
and I'm just trying to do

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,880
everything I can
to make sure you do.

69
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,780
<i>You're free now.
Hurry someone's coming.</i>

70
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,170
Still out Camael?

71
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,220
How did I make fire come
out of me like that?

72
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,420
- It just happened. I wasn't even trying.
- You don't need to sweet cheeks.

73
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,740
It's instinct.

74
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,820
You don't have to be taught
how to use your powers.

75
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,780
The angel side of you already knows.

76
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,520
But your feeble little human mind
gets in the way.

77
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,850
You just got to let go let
the angel side take over.

78
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,860
You can't just let it take over.

79
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,760
That's like freeing a wild animal
that has no sense of..

80
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,360
good or evil right or wrong.

81
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,070
You are so dramatic.
Well what about you huh?

82
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,650
You just do whatever you feel like?

83
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,120
You don't care about
what you say who you hurt?

84
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,780
It's just how the good Lord made me.
I'm being true to my nature.

85
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,610
You should try it sometime.

86
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,610
What is that noise?

87
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,640
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

88
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,400
I think the car is about done.
What'd you do to it?

89
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,710
Human-made
piece of crap!

90
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,710
Well never mind we're going
to have to foot now anyway.

91
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,660
Where are we going?
Yeah see those mountains over there?

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,170
That is where we're going
to find the Light Bringer.

93
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,010
This is turning out
to be a really bad day.

94
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:32,860
Leave me.
I need to speak to the Creator.

95
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:55,890
Nothing in the year since I've taken over
the Powers is what I've accomplished.

96
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,130
Under my command
we've remained faithful.

97
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,860
We've continued and will continue
to pursue the abominations

98
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,190
until they stain your planet no longer.

99
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,070
Is that what you perceive
your mission to be Mazarin?

100
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,090
Michael.

101
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,380
Camael?

102
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,540
Oh God. What have they done to you?

103
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,580
- Hold still Camael.
- No.

104
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:28,250
Yes you have to take
the healing you have to.

105
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,590
- What?
- Aaron...

106
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,640
We must find Aaron.

107
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,190
What?

108
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,890
It would be a whole lot easier
if we could just fly there.

109
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,420
But I don't have any wings genius.

110
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,800
I don't know how to fly.
Hey guys can I help you with anything?

111
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,820
You bet you can.

112
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,670
We wanted to see if we
could get some camping gear.

113
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,870
You headed up to the mountains?

114
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,560
You seem like an outdoorsy kind of a gal.

115
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,330
Do you ever play
any... indoor sports?

116
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,270
Sorry he doesn't
get out much.

117
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,600
You might need something
warmer than that. Come on.

118
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:27,310
Listen I don't how we're going to pay
for this stuff. I'm running out of cash.

119
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,260
- Where did you get that?
- Remember that waitress from the diner?

120
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,510
Yeah.

121
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,220
Remember that line
you told me not to cross?

122
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,220
- Yeah.
- I crossed it.

123
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,330
But in my defense it was
before you told me not to.

124
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,170
Is that your boyfriend? Not the guy with
the French fries the other one.

125
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,480
Why?

126
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,780
No reason. He's cute.

127
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,120
Yeah. I know.

128
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,660
So is he your boyfriend or not?

129
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,050
I'm not sure.

130
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,250
Lesbian.
Had to be.

131
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,920
Will you get over it?
Everybody gets rejected sometimes.

132
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,260
Not me. Nobody rejects me ever.

133
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,360
Well I know you think you're
God's gift to women but

134
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,120
I just don't see it. Sorry.

135
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh you don't do you?

136
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,630
If I turned it on sweetheart you
wouldn't know what to do with yourself.

137
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:44,860
The only reason I haven't is because
the Redeemer's sweet on you.

138
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,630
- Ignore him.
- You can't ignore me. It's impossible.

139
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,300
They lose a little something when
they get cold don't they?

140
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,490
<i>Hey guys come on let's go.</i>

141
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,660
How much further?

142
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,790
We won't get there
till tomorrow morning.

143
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,130
Ariel...

144
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,290
I'm dying.

145
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,490
- Don't say that. I can...
- You can give me

146
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,660
a little more time.

147
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,570
More strength.
That is all.

148
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,910
Perhaps this is what I deserve.
I clipped many an angel's wings

149
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,840
when I led the Powers.
I clipped yours.

150
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,790
At least you didn't use angelfire.
Not on you Ariel.

151
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:44,470
Sorry I haven't seen her.
Are you sure?

152
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:51,050
Take another look she's probably
traveling with a boy around her age.

153
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,420
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

154
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,140
Look if she was in here
I don't remember her all right?

155
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,590
Sorry I couldn't have been more help.

156
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,480
Hey Scott it's Deborah. Would you mind
coming by the store for a little while?

157
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,220
There's this guy...

158
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,800
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you nicely.

159
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,780
When was the girl here
and where did she go?

160
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,170
Lord Michael
mightiest of angels

161
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,660
he who cast the rebels from Heaven.

162
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,030
That'll be enough of that Mazarin.
On your feet. Let's speak as equals.

163
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,290
The Powers need guidance Michael.

164
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,150
Aren't you meant to guide them?
Isn't that your charge?

165
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,630
I'm not sure I'm worthy.

166
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,950
The Powers were instrumental
in squashing Lucifer's rebellion.

167
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,100
You and your clan killed more rebels
than the rest of the clans combined.

168
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,930
That was not a compliment.
The rebellion tested us all.

169
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,330
For the first time
we were given free will

170
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,880
the ability to chose not only who
we fought for but how we fought.

171
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,280
Do you understand what I'm saying?

172
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,780
I'm trying to tell you that the Powers
earned an exile as well.

173
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,190
Not so different from the Fallen.

174
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,440
Exile?
But...

175
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,670
But we remained faithful.

176
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,230
Which is why you were
given a noble mission...

177
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,670
to protect Earth against
threats to the Divine Plan.

178
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,620
And are we wrong?

179
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,960
Are we not meant
to destroy the Nephilim?

180
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,230
Is this boy really
who Camael says he is?

181
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,680
That's for you to decide.

182
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,150
There's at least one threat to the
planet of which you are certain.

183
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,660
Azazel.

184
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,650
To defeat him...

185
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,580
you may very well need the help of the
boy you've been trying so hard to kill.

186
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,700
<i>You know Azazel
you're not doing that right.</i>

187
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,290
Yes I know I'm not
doing it right Gabe.

188
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,060
<i>You sure that doesn't go over there?</i>

189
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,610
Gabe I've just realized what
I'm supposed to do with this

190
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,410
and you're not going
to like it.

191
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,120
Can't we just play
with these sticks instead?

192
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,250
Why am I doing this?
I don't even sleep.

193
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,830
<i>You're no fun.</i>

194
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,950
Try it.

195
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,630
- I don't know how.
- You did it earlier.

196
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,010
Look the angel inside of you
already knows how to do it.

197
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,770
The trick is to tap into that
knowledge without letting it take over.

198
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,180
- Go on give it a shot.
- No.

199
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,300
Come on just try it.

200
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,250
Picture it in your mind okay?

201
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,770
- I can't.
- Yes you can. Hey...

202
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,660
Focus.

203
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,730
Okay.

204
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,920
Okay great. Now just picture the flame

205
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,190
jumping from your hand into the fire.

206
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,930
All it takes is just a little nudge.

207
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,780
- I did it.
- Told you.

208
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,200
So you really don't
want to be redeemed?

209
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,190
Ever?

210
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,100
Heaven's just not for me. That's all.

211
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,820
It's not all sitting around on clouds
playing harps and all that crap you know?

212
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,430
So how much further to this Day Lighter
or whatever you call him?

213
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,730
Light Bringer.

214
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,200
I don't know how much
further sweetheart.

215
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,560
I didn't get the most
precise directions.

216
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:20,500
- So you don't even know where we're going.
- We're in the right general area.

217
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,790
And from what I understand it's damn
near impossible to miss the place.

218
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,320
Why were you imprisoned?

219
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,110
None of the other Fallen
were right? Just you.

220
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm not just any other
Fallen sweetheart.

221
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,120
- I used to lead them.
- You led them?

222
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,680
Almost straight to Hell. It was my idea
to come to Earth you know?

223
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,810
We made a decent team

224
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,320
Lucifer and me but it was a
temporary alliance from the start.

225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,550
I never wanted to take over
Heaven like he did.

226
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,190
I was fighting for the right to leave it.

227
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,480
- Where are you going?
- To take a leak.

228
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,300
To take a leak?

229
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,430
- I thought angels didn't take leaks.
- I'll figure something out.

230
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,910
Aaron are you sure we can trust him?

231
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,590
Azazel? Yeah.

232
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,670
- I mean he saved our lives twice.
- Yeah but...

233
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,380
Yeah.

234
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,440
But it doesn't seem like
he's fighting to protect us

235
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,200
as much as he just likes to fight.

236
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,680
Well at least
he's on our side.

237
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,880
You sure about that?

238
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,610
Yeah.

239
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I just hope you're not looking for answers
so hard you can't see anything else.

240
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,750
<i>waffles whipped cream syrup.</i>

241
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,200
- He's dreaming.
- Yeah I know.

242
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,590
Sounds like his dreams
are a lot better than mine.

243
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,390
What are they like
your dreams?

244
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,510
It's the same one...

245
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,710
over and over again.

246
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,070
I'm fighting some kind of war

247
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,280
except I don't even know...

248
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:03,160
whose side I'm on.

249
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,070
I'm just kind
of walking around

250
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,370
and cutting down everyone
in front of me.

251
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,900
It's like I'm some kind
of monster or something.

252
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,100
You're not a monster.

253
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,950
- It's just a dream.
- What if it's not a dream?

254
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,410
What if that's the real me?

255
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,200
That's all of this
that's the dream.

256
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,940
Funny I've been afraid that
I'm the one who's dreaming.

257
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,320
Like I'm going to wake up any minute
and find myself back in Lukas' attic.

258
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,870
You know

259
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,450
I thought about you all the time.

260
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,470
I still can't even
believe that you're here

261
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,750
Right next to me.

262
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,160
I'm sorry.

263
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,460
No you're beautiful.

264
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,160
Vanity is a sin
Azazel.

265
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,880
If the Creator hadn't wanted
me to admire myself

266
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,670
he wouldn't have made me so pretty.

267
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,320
- How are we  progressing?
- You'll have him tomorrow.

268
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,520
Good. I knew if anyone could
come through for me it would be you.

269
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm the only one who would
and the only one who could.

270
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,620
Which brings us to your
part of the bargain.

271
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,990
When this is over I want my freedom.

272
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,180
- I'm never going back  to that pit again.
- I see.

273
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,140
You're concerned that I'm going to
renege on my agreement

274
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,530
and imprison you again.

275
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,570
You should learn to be
more trusting Azazel.

276
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,360
- It's good for the soul.
- Too bad I don't have one.

277
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,580
<i>Azazel is that you?</i>

278
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,290
Gabe come on wake up boy.

279
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,690
- Oh thank God I found you.
- Found me?

280
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,790
I'm lost I walked off the trail two
days ago. I have no idea where I am.

281
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,310
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah I am now.

282
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,410
Hey look I haven't eaten in a
long time you got any extra food?

283
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,050
Yeah we have plenty of food.

284
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,720
Thanks. I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

285
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,060
Nephilim may have the powers of angels
but your biology is mostly human

286
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,460
unfortunately for you.

287
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,570
Ariel this is the sight [SITE?]
of Anane's redemption.

288
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,630
- I was wondering when you'd show up.
- Azazel is free.

289
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,890
And he's with your Nephilim.

290
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,530
You're not taking me back there.

291
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,090
Grasic's dead. It's the Redeemer I want.

292
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,760
Naughty.

293
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,180
You're okay.

294
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,000
- Who is that guy?
- That's the man who kidnapped me.

295
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,310
Look at all this stuff.

296
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,890
These are pretty cool.

297
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,760
You know if I hadn't have come galloping
to your rescue both your heads

298
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:53,170
would be mounted on a
wall somewhere by now.

299
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
No.

300
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,500
He said he wanted Aaron alive.
He knows that you're the Redeemer.

301
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:09,950
Wake up.

302
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,420
Who are you?

303
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,600
You with the Order huh?
Answer me!

304
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,560
Aaron stop it!

305
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,630
What do you people want from me?
What do you think we want?

306
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,270
We want redemption.

307
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,830
Did you really think your powers
can only be used on the Fallen?

308
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,730
His power wasn't meant for you.
It was meant for us.

309
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,660
That's not true. You can send
anyone you want to Heaven

310
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,980
whether they deserve it or not.

311
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,240
Yeah.

312
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,860
Yeah whether they worship
graven images or not

313
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:57,270
whether they covet their neighbor's
wife if they repent or not.

314
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,210
I would never use my powers like that.

315
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,940
The stench of death
is all over you my friend.

316
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:19,360
You don't have
long left do you?

317
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,270
I have a brain tumor

318
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
that's why I need you.

319
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,270
I've done a lot of bad things in my life

320
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,470
things that can never be forgiven
but you can pardon me

321
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,690
you can keep me from going to Hell.
You can wash me clean of my sins.

322
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,170
Please please.

323
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,660
Sorry.

324
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,110
- I can't do that.
- No.

325
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,850
No. You're going to have
to pay for what you've done.

326
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,820
You just killed him.

327
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,110
- Why would you do that?
- He was dying anyway.

328
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,830
He kidnapped your girlfriend sold her

329
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,320
he was trying to use you to get a
bunch of sinners into Heaven.

330
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,550
Leave him.

331
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,650
He's nothing to us.

332
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,020
Aaron...

333
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:59,070
- this is wrong.
- I know.

334
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,210
I don't know why Azazel is free

335
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,810
or what he's doing
with the Redeemer.

336
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,420
I served under Azazel.

337
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,420
Locking him up was the only
good thing you Powers ever did.

338
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:23,660
Mazarin take to the sky. Scout ahead.
Look for any traces of angel activity.

339
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,480
Sachael come with us.

340
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,900
We don't take orders
from you anymore Camael.

341
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,770
You will. That is the only way
we're going to do this.

342
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,640
Is it always going to be like this?
I don't know if I can do this Aaron

343
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,520
all this running
and fighting and killing.

344
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,600
I don't like it either.

345
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,610
Part of you must.

346
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,870
I've seen it... when you fight.

347
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,480
Sometimes it looks
like you're enjoying it.

348
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,060
Just like Azazel.

349
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:12,650
I'm nothing like Azazel.

350
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,560
Why are we doing this anyway? What is it
you want to learn from this Light Bringer?

351
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,930
Maybe he can tell me

352
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,490
more about where I come from.

353
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,930
Why I have all these visions and

354
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,840
all these dreams and why I have all
this anger inside of me

355
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,770
and just what it means to be the Redeemer.

356
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,080
Maybe he can tell me who I am.

357
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,100
Aaron no one can
tell you that.

358
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,740
You need to decide
for yourself who you are.

359
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,120
Then you should try to ve up to that.

360
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,450
- There it is.
- This is it?

361
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,170
Yeah that's where |you're going.

362
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,070
- You sure this is the place?
- Have I ever lied to you?

363
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,530
- This isn't for you.
- Why can't you come?

364
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,630
This isn't about us Aaron.

365
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,110
Aaron this doesn't feel right.

366
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,250
Don't go in there.

367
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,260
I have to.

368
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,020
Hello?

369
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,750
Anybody here?

370
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,770
You'll have to forgive me.

371
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,170
I wasn't expecting
you so soon.

372
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,540
I've waited a long
time to meet you.

373
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:44,770
- Are you the Light Bringer?
- I am.

374
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:51,640
- And you're Aaron Corbett the Redeemer.
- How do you know|my name?

375
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:57,380
This meeting like your birth
was foretold to me long ago.

376
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,480
So it is true.

377
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,730
You did write
the prophecy about me.

378
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,190
Yes.

379
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,840
You've come here
looking for answers

380
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:16,270
to learn where you come from so that you
can better understand where you're going.

381
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,500
I have so much
to tell you Aaron.

382
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,920
I can help you learn the truth
if you're strong enough to face it.

383
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:29,630
Are you?

384
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,120
Yes...

385
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,810
I am.

386
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,760
How are you doing
back there?

387
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,220
I would not have had
your wings removed Camael.

388
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,040
That was Mazarin's
doing not mine.

389
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,860
I remember Sachael.

390
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,960
He's a good soldier
you know that

391
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,760
but your desertion broke his heart.

392
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,080
Might want to get comfortable love.
This might take a while.

393
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,880
What is this place?

394
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,280
It's a monastery
or rather it was.

395
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,530
It hasn't been
used in decades.

396
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:52,760
In fact you're the first living soul
I've seen here in years.

397
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,820
People don't often
find their way here.

398
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,850
Not unless they're
seeking me out.

399
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,660
Now you must be very tired.
Maybe you'd like to sit down?

400
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,180
So do you really
know everything about me?

401
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,330
Hardly.

402
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,260
But I am very curious to hear
what you know about yourself

403
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,500
or what you believe you know.

404
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,770
Well I know that
my father is an angel.

405
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,950
And my mother is dead.

406
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,690
Does that disturb you knowing that
your father allowed your mother to die?

407
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,740
He didn't allow|her to die.

408
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,720
He killed her.

409
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,650
Is that how you view your conception?
As murder?

410
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,130
Isn't that what it is?

411
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,900
The Fallen know that a human
can't survive a Nephilim's birth.

412
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,480
Our mothers die
the second we're born

413
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:47,710
and we're left alone to spend the rest
of our lives running from the Powers.

414
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,220
It's selfish
and it's cruel

415
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,800
and the truth is

416
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:00,640
I don't know if any of the Fallen
are truly worthy of redemption.

417
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,440
We should have
left him behind.

418
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,950
He's a liability.

419
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:26,700
The Nephilim won't trust us without
Ariel and Camael. We need them.

420
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,430
I don't blame you for being angry

421
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,900
but the way you look
at your mother's death

422
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:44,530
it does her a great disservice.

423
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,140
What do you mean?

424
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:53,980
You paint her as a... a victim instead
of the martyr she truly was.

425
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,530
I loved her very much.

426
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,120
You... You loved her?

427
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,030
Yes Aaron.

428
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm your father.

429
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,110
I know how
you must be feeling.

430
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,610
There were times when
I really need a father.

431
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,750
Where were you?

432
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,290
I was here
waiting for you.

433
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,220
I couldn't have
raised you Aaron.

434
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,560
For your own protection you need to
remain hidden until you came of age.

435
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
You have no idea how sorry.

436
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,510
I just hope that you can
find it in your heart to forgive me.

437
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,130
To forgive you?

438
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,860
I can feel it when a Fallen

439
00:44:58,150 --> 00:44:59,530
wants redemption

440
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,220
and I have never
felt it as strongly

441
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:05,610
as I do right now.

442
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,550
Is that what you want?

443
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,630
From me to send you
back to Heaven?

444
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,750
You are the Redeemer.

445
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,200
And when the time is right
when you

446
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,760
are absolutely certain that I have
atoned for my sins

447
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:26,970
yes perhaps you will
return me to Paradise.

448
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,950
And that is when you will have
fulfilled your destiny.

449
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,830
So that's what
all of this is about?

450
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,190
That's why I have
all this power?

451
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,840
Just so I can redeem you?

452
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,100
All the Fallen must return
to Heaven Aaron.

453
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:47,690
That's the prophecy.

454
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,530
But if I don't return
to Heaven myself then...

455
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,660
then it was... all for nothing.

456
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,130
From the moment I took up arms
against the Creator

457
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,660
to the day that I had my vision that
foretold your coming...

458
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,590
Oh I denied it at first

459
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:29,880
but after I thought about it
it made perfect sense...

460
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,800
that this Redeemer

461
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,560
would come from a Fallen
that needed forgiveness most.

462
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,070
The one who started it all.

463
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,720
Who are you?

464
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:45,980
Who am I?

465
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,440
I am nothing but what you see
before you Aaron.

466
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,180
A fallen angel

467
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:57,040
the Bringer of Light...

468
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,890
Your father.

469
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,720
I want to know your name.

470
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,960
I have so many names.

471
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,220
More than I can even
remember myself.

472
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,520
But the one
the Creator gave me...

473
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:19,840
is Lucifer.

474
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,700
No.

475
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,340
Yes Aaron.

476
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:29,500
I am Lucifer Morningstar first of
the Fallen and you are my son.

477
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,220
I don't believe you.

478
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:35,350
Yes you do.

479
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:39,100
You know it's true.
You can feel it.

480
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,100
- My blood has been crying out to you.
- Get away from me!

481
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:44,980
Stay away!

482
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:54,390
Aaron.

483
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,380
Don't come any closer.

484
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:05,500
I am not the son
of the Devil.

485
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,680
And I am not what
you believe me to be.

486
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,400
Please let me
make you understand.

487
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:13,920
I do understand.

488
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:19,350
I finally understand what all of these
dreams have been trying to tell me.

489
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,920
Dreams?

490
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,520
I see myself as evil.

491
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,200
I see myself as a monster

492
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,070
like you.

493
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,690
Whatever you think I am

494
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:36,520
please give me the chance
to convince you otherwise.

495
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,950
Or strike me down now.

496
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,900
I shall make no move
to stop you.

497
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:43,830
My fate is entirely
in your hands.

498
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,450
I knew you would make
the right decision.

499
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:07,600
You always do.

500
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,010
Ariel.

501
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,780
Azazel did this.

502
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,870
I can smell him.

503
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:17,390
Azazel is a force
of nature.

504
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,010
He will never change.

505
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:21,150
But realigning with Lucifer?

506
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,600
After all it's cost us?

507
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,490
Lucifer?

508
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,180
Lucifer is involved
in this?

509
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:32,300
He wants the Redeemer.

510
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:36,070
He used Azazel to get him.

511
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,640
Can Lucifer use this boy
to return to Heaven?

512
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,210
Why do you think I've been trying
so very hard to protect him?

513
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,180
I've been trying to prevent
this very thing from happening.

514
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,510
Azazel got to Aaron
because of you.

515
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,570
He's in Lucifer's hands now
because of you.

516
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,310
The world as we know it

517
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,500
may be about to end...

518
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,640
because of you.

519
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,530
Do you know why
I rebelled Aaron?

520
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,930
It's because you wanted
to take over Heaven

521
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:53,020
steal it from the Creator.

522
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:57,570
As they say history is written
by the winners.

523
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,860
You know the truth is...

524
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,390
I only wanted the freedom
to choose my own destiny.

525
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,480
But it is not better to reign in Hell
than it is to serve in Heaven.

526
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,200
I didn't construct Hell

527
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:16,100
to be a haven
for the Creator's rejects.

528
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,330
But when more of them started to come
to me instead of Heaven...

529
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,220
You assumed the Creator gave up on them.

530
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,120
Yes.

531
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,430
Humans love to disobey.

532
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,670
None of it's true then?

533
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,990
All of the horrible things you're
supposed to be responsible for?

534
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:40,560
They're all lies?

535
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,270
No.

536
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,360
No I'm not saying
I'm perfect.

537
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:53,070
But your arrival tells me
that I have atoned.

538
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:56,060
More than that
I know it in my heart.

539
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:59,670
When all the angels
have reunited in Heaven

540
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:05,240
then we can restore the Earth to the
reflection of Paradise it was meant to be.

541
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:10,820
You could bring us all
back together.

542
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,800
And what if I don't?

543
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:22,250
Well you've seen the signs...

544
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:29,160
war famine pestilence death.
It's all around us.

545
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,730
These are the End Times Aaron.

546
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,480
The Day of Judgment is coming.

547
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,870
And only you can stop it.

548
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,940
How long is he going
to be in there for?

549
00:53:58,250 --> 00:53:59,740
As long as it takes.

550
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,980
As long as what takes?

551
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,880
For him to accept the truth.

552
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:06,800
What truth?
Is he going to be all right?

553
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,530
The truth hurts.

554
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,500
Sometimes it hurts more than others.

555
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,390
I'm going in there.

556
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,230
I wouldn't do that
if I were you sweetheart.

557
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,130
No of course you wouldn't.

558
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,710
You wouldn't do anything
unless there's something in it for you.

559
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,530
Is this Light Bringer
the one who freed you?

560
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,280
Is this why you brought
Aaron over here?

561
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,490
You've got me all figured out
don't you sweetcheeks?

562
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:45,280
Yeah I made a deal with him.

563
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,450
And deals with him don't come cheap.

564
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:51,390
What are you talking about?

565
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,450
You can speak every
conceivable language.

566
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:58,520
You don't even understand what you know.

567
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,840
What is "Light Bringer" in Latin?

568
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,710
Lucifer.

569
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:11,840
Right.

570
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,920
Aaron put his faith in you.

571
00:55:16,670 --> 00:55:17,790
He's a fool.

572
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,040
<i>I'm coming too.</i>

573
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,000
<i>I can smell him Vilma.</i>

574
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,460
Hello?

575
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:16,800
Aaron?

576
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:36,140
<i>Aaron?</i>

577
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,430
<i>Who's that?</i>

578
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,140
Lucifer.

579
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,910
So you're telling me that

580
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,890
in order to save Earth

581
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,610
I have to send the Devil
back to Heaven?

582
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,790
I told you I haven't
been the Devil in ages.

583
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:58,710
It was my vision of you

584
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:02,510
that inspired me to leave Hell

585
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,930
and serve my penance on Earth.

586
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,380
Just like any of the Fallen.

587
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,990
Just like the ones
you've already redeemed.

588
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,910
Their sin was the same as mine
and you found them worthy.

589
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,090
Aaron...

590
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,730
we all deserve forgiveness

591
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,700
if we truly want it.

592
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:38,680
You can't deny what your body
is telling you.

593
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:48,760
Ok.

594
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,580
Ok?

595
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,060
I'll do it.

596
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,410
Oh thank you son.

597
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:02,730
Thank you.

598
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:10,800
Give me your hand.

599
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:56,290
I saw you. I saw the things
you've done.

600
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,690
I saw what you really are.

601
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:01,700
No. No you...
you saw me as I was.

602
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,470
I want to trust you.

603
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,970
I do.

604
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,190
But I can't.

605
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,940
Please Aaron.
I'm your father.

606
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,110
I came here...

607
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,900
looking for answers.

608
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,220
Like you were just going to say some
magic words

609
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,310
and all of a sudden my life would just
make sense.

610
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,720
But I don't care what the prophecy says.

611
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:37,060
I don't care what anybody
tells me to do.

612
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,490
I know what feels right
and I know what doesn't.

613
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,190
And this feels wrong.

614
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,330
I can't redeem you.

615
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,200
I won't.

616
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,210
Il gran rifiuto.

617
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:13,310
I'm going home now.

618
01:01:17,490 --> 01:01:18,500
No Aaron.

619
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:22,580
You're not going anywhere.

620
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,300
Where are we?

621
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,810
No! No! No!

622
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,690
Just finished.

623
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,820
You're safe now.

624
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,690
This was my punishment...

625
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,230
an eternity without you.

626
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,100
But you came back to me
thank God.

627
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,790
No! No!

628
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,390
Lukas you can't do this to me.

629
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:16,500
Maybe this is Heaven after all.

630
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:42,500
Where are we?

631
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,630
The monastery

632
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,610
is where I broke through Aaron.

633
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,440
My portal to Earth.

634
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,430
I'm not able to leave
its grounds but...

635
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,140
I am allowed certain
comforts of home here.

636
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,140
To enter these walls

637
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,780
is to enter Hell itself.

638
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,730
This is Hell?

639
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:16,750
Yes.

640
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:21,150
This is my dominion.

641
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,300
And you

642
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,490
like these poor souls

643
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:29,920
are now a prisoner here.

644
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,450
But I am offering you

645
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:38,320
something that the rest of my guests
would do anything to have.

646
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,160
A way out.

647
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:48,350
Send me home son

648
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,140
to Paradise.

649
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,460
So you can take over?

650
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,590
Is that what you want?

651
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:00,890
 No.

652
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,290
I won't let you.

653
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:08,090
And if I have to spend
an eternity in Hell

654
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:10,810
to make sure that you never get there

655
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:15,740
that's a sacrifice
that I'm willing to make.

656
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,440
How noble of you.

657
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:24,770
But...

658
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,180
what of the lovely
Ms. Rodriguez?

659
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:31,390
She entered the monastery
looking for you.

660
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:33,340
But she found...

661
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:36,060
something else.

662
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,220
Where is she?

663
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,120
She's in my care.

664
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,480
And she will remain there

665
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,580
until you do
what you were born to do.

666
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:49,370
I don't believe you.

667
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,500
This is another one
of your lies.

668
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:57,180
Is it?

669
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:04,030
Look down there.

670
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,480
I knew Vilma.

671
01:05:12,170 --> 01:05:13,120
Vilma!

672
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,720
I always knew

673
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:17,870
that we'd end up together.

674
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,490
It's not the Redeemer
you belong with.

675
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,930
It's me Vilma.

676
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,960
There were times

677
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:34,440
when you were happy with me.

678
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,710
Do you rember?

679
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,920
You'll be happy again.

680
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,500
She can't hear
or see you Aaron.

681
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,450
Just look at her.

682
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:53,180
An eternity as a prisoner
of that twisted old man.

683
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:56,250
It's one thing
to sacrifice yourself Aaron.

684
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:59,990
But are you willing to damn
the woman you love?

685
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,710
Wipe these runes away.

686
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:07,330
If I brush away
those markings

687
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,360
then I'll condemn myself

688
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,810
to eternal torment.

689
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:19,710
If I don't...

690
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,150
I'll condemn you.

691
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:48,220
Go.

692
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,010
Thank you.

693
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,870
Just go.

694
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,220
Well...

695
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,500
the esteemed Dr. Grasic
just earned himself

696
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:09,040
an upgrade in his damnation.

697
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,840
You couldn't
keep her here.

698
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:22,740
You can't keep anyone here.

699
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,300
You don't have
that kind of power.

700
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:29,290
Hell is a choice that we make.

701
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:34,450
The only real
prisoner here is you.

702
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,250
You're so smart.

703
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:45,570
I tried to be nice

704
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,090
I tried intimidation and now

705
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,560
I have to resort to force.

706
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,860
Then go ahead.

707
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:54,630
Kill me.

708
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,010
I'm not afraid.

709
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,020
I didn't expect to see you again.

710
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,940
Did you find
what you were looking for?

711
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:20,020
You sent Aaron to his doom.

712
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:22,100
You knew!

713
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,420
He trusted you.

714
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:26,400
You can help him.

715
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:29,400
You have to Azazel.
I know you can.

716
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:30,660
Why would I?

717
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:34,580
You know what it's like
to be held against your will.

718
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:36,630
This is your chance

719
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,690
to make up for everything
that you've done wrong.

720
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:41,310
Take it.

721
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,830
Please Azazel.|Please.

722
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:47,430
Do it!

723
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,720
Do it or what?

724
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:53,500
Or I'll kill you.

725
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,120
I was thinking about it!

726
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,750
I was on the fence!

727
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,850
But then you had to go
and ask me so politely.

728
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:08,060
I think I have
some time to kill.

729
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:14,080
You're right Aaron
I can't keep you here in Hell.

730
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:18,440
But I can persuade you
to be reasonable.

731
01:09:19,310 --> 01:09:22,800
And this time don't expect Azazel
to come to your rescue.

732
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:25,290
Azazel knew what you wanted.

733
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,090
He was in on this.

734
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,960
Of course he was.

735
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:30,340
So

736
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,840
it comes down to this.

737
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,140
If you stand against me

738
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:38,990
you stand alone.

739
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:55,790
I am the most powerful angel
that was ever created.

740
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,590
Do you really believe
that you can beat me?

741
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:15,710
The angel in me is just as powerful
as you are.

742
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,230
But my humanity
makes me stronger.

743
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:20,870
Really?

744
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,860
You've been defeated before.

745
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:25,170
And once is enough.

746
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,330
Not bad for a girl.

747
01:11:05,490 --> 01:11:07,800
You know I hate
hurting pretty girls!

748
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,230
But something about you
really pisses me off.

749
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,810
Run!

750
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,920
Camael.
I thought you were dead.

751
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,130
Let's see if we can fix that.

752
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:26,830
This is where it ends.

753
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:46,920
Azazel no!

754
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,320
Azazel.

755
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:06,800
Mazarin!

756
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:11,860
5000 years ago
I put you in chains.

757
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:14,200
Will you return willingly?

758
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,550
Never!

759
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,550
Then you leave me no choice
but to fight you to the death.

760
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,520
Now you're speaking
my language!

761
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,790
Let's do this!
Man to man!

762
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,490
You are my son!

763
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:20,040
You were born to help me
destroy the Creator

764
01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:23,040
and by God you are going
to live up to that!

765
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,120
Surrender my son.

766
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,760
The prophecy.

767
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:39,180
I don't care
about the prophecy.

768
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,240
I care about my destiny!

769
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,830
This is my life!

770
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,010
I'm taking control of it.

771
01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:05,330
I'm sorry son.

772
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:08,320
I never meant for it
to end like this.

773
01:14:15,530 --> 01:14:17,520
Go ahead!
Say it!

774
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,230
Go to Hell!

775
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,830
<i>Aaron!</i>

776
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:45,500
Gabe.

777
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,670
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

778
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,490
Go ahead.

779
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,830
Kill me.

780
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:15,230
Kill me!

781
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,520
Give me a warrior's death.

782
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,890
You know you want to.

783
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:24,430
No Azazel.

784
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,490
I follow the Creator's orders.
Not yours.

785
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,220
Ariel.

786
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:43,790
Ariel...

787
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,290
Long time no see.

788
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:50,030
Don't do it.

789
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,630
No you're going back.

790
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,550
Then how about
a kiss good-night?

791
01:16:17,630 --> 01:16:19,650
I'm so glad
you're all right.

792
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:27,140
Camael!

793
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:33,500
You're alive?

794
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:39,030
What happened to you?

795
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:42,370
Did you...
Did you see him?

796
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:45,480
Aaron...

797
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:50,380
did you meet... Lucifer?

798
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,170
I sent him back to Hell...

799
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:56,900
where he belongs.

800
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:05,070
It's too late for me.

801
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:08,170
I'm not going
to let you die.

802
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,130
I'd never considered...

803
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:15,840
that your powers

804
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:18,550
would apply to me.

805
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,220
I've taken
so many lives Aaron.

806
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,560
I've killed so many.

807
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,900
I... I have not earned

808
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,270
my redemption.

809
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:45,090
If anyone's earned
their redemption Camael

810
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:48,950
it's you.

811
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,530
And I'm going
to send you home now.

812
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,440
Good-bye Camael.

813
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:13,890
Good-bye...

814
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,890
my friend.

815
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:21,940
I'll be watching you...

816
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:24,640
Nephilim.

817
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:18,800
Forgive me.

818
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:22,260
You are indeed the Redeemer
of the prophecy.

819
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,140
It's over.

820
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,350
All of it.

821
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:35,560
You're going to stop
killing the Fallen

822
01:19:36,050 --> 01:19:37,280
the Nephilim.

823
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:40,760
Find yourself
a new mission.

824
01:19:58,670 --> 01:19:59,820
Noooo!

825
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,340
No!

826
01:20:03,740 --> 01:20:07,390
Your sentence was to remain here
until Judgment Day Azazel.

827
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:10,460
But the Redeemer
has defeated Lucifer.

828
01:20:11,230 --> 01:20:13,200
So that day may never come.

829
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:21,640
Well I'm nothing
if not patient Mazarin!

830
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:26,580
We'll just have to wait
and see won't we?

831
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,610
So what happens now?

832
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,920
Well Aaron
that's really up to you.

833
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,350
There are still a lot of Fallen
who need redemption right?

834
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:10,500
Yes but everything's different now.
They can come out of hiding.

835
01:21:10,580 --> 01:21:14,320
You no longer have to risk your life
trying to track them down.

836
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,750
They can come to you.

837
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:20,790
So you can do whatever you want.

838
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,310
So...

839
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,610
what do you want to do?

840
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:32,160
<i>Yeah what's next?</i>

841
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,100
I want to go home.

842
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:42,920
Will you come with me?

843
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,710
Anywhere.

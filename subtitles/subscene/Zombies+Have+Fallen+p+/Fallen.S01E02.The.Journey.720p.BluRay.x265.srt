1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,254
<i>Previously on Fallen...</i>

2
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:06,916
I think angels are here.

3
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:10,485
Don't you ever feel like you're
in the presence of something special?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,968
I'm really scared.

5
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:14,531
I'm afraid there's something
wrong with me.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:15,623
Aaron scared?

7
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,071
Aaron okay?

8
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:19,501
A dog is not talking
to me.

9
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:20,915
But you are in danger...

10
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:22,879
Nephilim.

11
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:24,427
Why did you call me
Nephilim?

12
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:26,689
'Cause that's what
you are.
You're half angel, half human.

13
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:29,319
The Nephilim have
the powers of angels,

14
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,083
but the souls of man.

15
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,247
They are
the biblical half-breeds.

16
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:34,728
The prophecy said
you would come,

17
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,259
and here you are.

18
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,571
He bears the names
of the Fallen.

19
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,550
He has the touch
of the angels.

20
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:44,229
Uh, the Powers

21
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:48,040
think that they are the Creator's
personal storm troopers.

22
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:51,519
And their whole goal
is to get rid of Nephilim.

23
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,298
And they absolutely

24
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:55,561
hate the Fallen.

25
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,742
The important thing is
that Camael,

26
00:00:57,825 --> 00:01:00,687
leader of the powers, is here,
and he's probably looking for you.

27
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:02,884
I've been looking for you
for centuries.

28
00:01:02,885 --> 00:01:04,913
Look, I've been kicked around
since I was a baby.

29
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:06,661
one foster home to another.

30
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,958
and all I ever wanted
was a normal life.

31
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,404
your life is in grave danger.
e devi venire con me adesso.

32
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:12,837
I can protect you.
I can hide you.

33
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:14,509
why don't you go back to Heaven

34
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,307
and leave me the hell alone?

35
00:01:16,788 --> 00:01:20,067
You tell us where the Nephilim are,
and we let you live.

36
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:21,997
Sent killer angels
to my house?

37
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,161
What about my family?

38
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:25,459
Well, they're not
your family anyway.

39
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:29,069
If you forsake your powers,
You can save the life
you have here.

40
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:32,198
If not, you will become
what you were born to be...

41
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,195
the Redeemer.

42
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:36,606
When God created man,

43
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:39,669
a jealous Lucifer mounted
a great rebellion in Heaven.

44
00:01:40,002 --> 00:01:41,833
His army of angels
was defeated

45
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:43,896
and forever banished
from paradise.

46
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,142
These angels, the Fallen,

47
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,722
abandoned Lucifer,
choosing to live on Earth

48
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:50,319
among the pleasures of humans.

49
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:53,731
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

50
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,554
children called Nephilim.

51
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:58,683
They have the powers
of angels
but the souls of men.

52
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,196
Angry, the Creator
flooded the Earth,

53
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,375
killing the Nephilim
and driving the Fallen
into hiding.

54
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:07,274
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

55
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:09,271
to hunt those
that survived the flood.

56
00:02:10,852 --> 00:02:13,132
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy.

57
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,029
A Nephilim would be born

58
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,441
who would redeem them
and return them to paradise.

59
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:20,903
So the Fallen watched...
and waited.

60
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:36,431
Sometimes I...

61
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,442
wonder what it would be like
if Lucifer had won
the war.

62
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,889
I mean, it's not like
he got us on his side

63
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,355
with promises of an evil empire
and

64
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,127
eternal suffering.

65
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:51,271
All that came later...
after the Fall.

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,766
I've tried my best
to make up
for what I've done.

67
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:57,877
To help the humans
defend themselves

68
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:00,007
against what I helped to create.
But...

69
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:04,027
I mean, there's just
as much hate in the world,
just as much suffering.

70
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:07,997
More, even.
So have I atoned
for what I have done?

71
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:11,409
I don't know.

72
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,745
I just know
I wanna go home.

73
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,778
Then that's where you'll go.

74
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,812
It's been one year since I found out
that I have the power

75
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:27,083
to send Fallen angels
back to Heaven.

76
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:30,710
But the Powers can sense
every redemption.

77
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:34,970
And we always risk
the possibility of an attack.

78
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:37,800
So we never stop running.

79
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,359
So many Fallen...

80
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,754
yet to be redeemed.

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,896
Be patient.

82
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:15,590
Stay here.

83
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:18,669
I'm fighting with you this time.
No, you're not.

84
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,101
I'm not gonna just sit here.

85
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,296
Aaron!

86
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:53,939
Most Nephilim
don't put up a fight.

87
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,903
Well, I'm not like
most Nephilim.

88
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:03,187
You'll die like them,
though.

89
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:18,901
I don't know what just happened to me.
I told you to stay in the car.

90
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,865
It's like I almost
wasn't even there.

91
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:24,325
I remember fighting, but it's
like remembering a dream.

92
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:27,079
I felt like I could take on
the Powers all by myself.

93
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,172
- I almost felt like I was invincible.
- You are far from it.

94
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:35,549
When you lose control like that,
you are losing the very thing

95
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,364
that gives you the advantage
over your opponent.

96
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:41,457
You are as powerful
as any angel there is,
Aaron.

97
00:06:41,573 --> 00:06:43,920
But your humanity
makes you stronger.

98
00:06:45,546 --> 00:06:47,659
In time, you will learn
to master this duality,

99
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,870
but until then you will focus
on returning the Fallen
to Heaven,

100
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,085
and you will leave
the fighting to me.

101
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:56,564
If I hadn't fought,
you'd be dead right now,
Camael.

102
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:03,665
Your journey...
has just begun.

103
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:08,174
You must be patient.

104
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:23,710
You all right?

105
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,054
I could heal you.

106
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:29,084
He did heal me,
Camael.

107
00:07:31,497 --> 00:07:35,292
A wound...
caused by angelfire is much different.

108
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,353
You cannot heal it.

109
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,097
What are we
gonna do, then?

110
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:45,326
Find someone who can.

111
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:20,699
She's gone, Ariel.

112
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,121
Get the paddles, Clarence.

113
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:27,719
Get the paddles.

114
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:42,527
Nobody dies on my watch.

115
00:08:58,694 --> 00:08:59,843
Welcome back.

116
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,628
Drop me off here.

117
00:09:05,892 --> 00:09:07,394
This may take some time.

118
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,443
Camael.

119
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:16,926
Could we check out
the school?

120
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:20,187
Fine.
But stay close.

121
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:24,530
And that's the long history of division,
as nation after nation suffered the effects...

122
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,712
Aaron, this is bigger
than your old school.

123
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,515
Well, this is college.
It's different.

124
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:33,383
...and every freethinking
individual is a lost prophet.

125
00:09:33,524 --> 00:09:36,092
And every poetic prophecy
is a conscious conspiracy

126
00:09:36,257 --> 00:09:38,638
to emancipate ourselves
from mental slavery.

127
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,572
And we will get free or die.

128
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,171
Because the numbers
don't lie.

129
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:47,338
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:51,181
I wasn't even watching where I was going.
No, I wasn't watching where I was going.

131
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:51,979
Hi.

132
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,935
Paradise Lost.
I know, it, uh...

133
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:55,991
Yawn.

134
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:02,354
So, uh,
what's your major?

135
00:10:03,152 --> 00:10:04,853
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't, uh...

136
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:07,070
I don't... I don't go
to school here.

137
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,330
Uh, just...
just visiting.

138
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:10,597
Yeah.

139
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:12,602
Right.

140
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:13,729
Looks pretty cool,
though.

141
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,212
Yeah, it's okay.

142
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,648
- I'm Chloe.
- Aaron.

143
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:23,051
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

144
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:29,719
Excuse me,
is there something
I can help you with?

145
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,053
Hey, you're not supposed
to be in here.

146
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:35,317
He's right...

147
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,445
you're notsupposed to be here.

148
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,307
- Ariel.
- Punisher.

149
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:42,567
Punisher?

150
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:45,042
Yeah, that's what we called
him in high school.

151
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,189
Linebacker.

152
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,379
Wow. This is great.

153
00:10:58,153 --> 00:11:00,441
What's it like,
going to college?

154
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:02,858
I don't know.
It's pretty fun,
I guess.

155
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,479
I mean, it's true what they say,
you know.

157
00:11:07,761 --> 00:11:10,455
Being away from your parents
in a different environment,

158
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:12,473
you really do learn
a lot about yourself.

159
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,030
What have you learned?

160
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:20,244
that I like partying
almost as much as I hate hangovers.

161
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,737
Uh, how come
you don't go?

162
00:11:27,484 --> 00:11:29,584
I... I want to.
I do.

163
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,657
I guess I just...

164
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,387
I got a lot going on
in my...
in my life right now.

165
00:11:39,461 --> 00:11:42,628
Well, if you're interested,
you can come to class with me.

166
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:44,282
Help me stay awake.

167
00:11:44,364 --> 00:11:45,467
You can do that?

168
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:48,032
Well, they won't let any random
person come in off the street,

169
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,636
but if you're accompanied
by an actual student...

170
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,912
I suppose I could vouch
for you.

171
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:54,941
Thanks.

172
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,320
Well, I'd love to
i'd do something like that.

173
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,349
I would, um...
I just, uh...

174
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:03,508
I don't know
if I can.

175
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,300
Why not?
You need Gabe's permission or something?

176
00:12:06,719 --> 00:12:07,997
I like her, Aaron.

177
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,341
Come on, 9:00 tomorrow
in that building right over there.

178
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:13,698
I'm gonna meet you
out front.

179
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,272
I'll see you there.

180
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:53,795
Hello?

181
00:12:55,472 --> 00:12:56,481
Who's there?

182
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:02,706
Don't tell me it's judgment day already.

183
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:08,999
I was just getting comfortable.

184
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:11,026
No, Azazel.

185
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,290
Not yet.

186
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:17,501
But soon.
Before you know it,

187
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,477
Gabriel's horn
will sound,

188
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:25,545
and you will be cast
into the fires of Hell for all eternity.

189
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:30,756
I doubt you'll find that
environment any more hospitable.

190
00:13:34,515 --> 00:13:36,767
Well, at least it will be
a change of scenery.

191
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,709
What...

192
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:45,263
is this language
we're speaking?

193
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,316
It's called English.

194
00:13:48,337 --> 00:13:51,094
It's been very popular
on Earth
for quite some time.

195
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:54,965
How long have
I been here?

196
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,670
5,000 years.

197
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:00,837
Give or take a century.

198
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:03,195
I'm curious.

199
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:07,271
Did you think more time had passed,
or less?

200
00:14:09,303 --> 00:14:10,898
What do you want?

201
00:14:13,421 --> 00:14:16,916
To give you...
what you desire most.

202
00:14:19,262 --> 00:14:20,728
You'd give me my freedom?

203
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,811
If you agree to help me.

204
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,581
It is the time
of the Redeemer, Azazel.

205
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:31,385
As the prophecy
has foretold,

206
00:14:32,018 --> 00:14:36,918
a Nephilim has been born
with the power to return fallen angels to Heaven.

207
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:42,396
And I need you...
to help him fulfill his destiny.

208
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:45,593
So...

209
00:14:47,294 --> 00:14:48,866
do we have an agreement?

210
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:53,182
We most certainly do.

211
00:15:36,461 --> 00:15:38,142
How are you, Gadreel?

212
00:15:43,386 --> 00:15:44,934
How did you get out?

213
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,870
Don't concern yourself
with such things.

214
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:56,133
You know, you got to learn
how to blend in.

215
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:59,262
That's how I stayed alive for so long.

216
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:02,077
Fine, but there's something
I should rather do first.

217
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,112
I'll bet there is.
But you waited 5,000 years.

218
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:07,329
You can wait
a few more hours.

219
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,030
Can you?

220
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:12,768
Thousands have taken to the streets

221
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:16,147
<i>in protests of the arrests of
anti-Russian activists this morning.</i>

222
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:19,040
<i>Cars were set on fire
and storefronts smashed,</i>

223
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,061
<i>as an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy
in the capital of Rome.</i>

224
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,890
So who is
this woman, anyway?

225
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:26,313
<i>Over in the Middle East
oil fires were still burning...</i>

226
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:28,225
Ariel took over
the underground

227
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,900
after the death
of Samchial last year.

228
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:35,977
She's the one who has been giving me
the locations of those you have redeemed.

229
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,713
She's in charge
of the Fallen?

230
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:39,648
Yes.

231
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,342
Aaron.

232
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:52,922
It is so good
to finally meet you.

233
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:56,793
God, I feel like I already know you.
Camael's told me so much about you.

234
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,175
He did not tell me how good-looking
you were, though.

235
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:00,782
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

236
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,870
I'm not exactly his type.

237
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,584
What?

238
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:12,208
It's just... Usually when I'm
around the Fallen, I get this...

239
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:15,759
weird feeling.

240
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:20,240
Um, it's how I know
they need redemption.

241
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,496
I don't feel that need
from you.

242
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:33,177
You're picking up
on their desire
for forgiveness,

243
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:36,218
their beliefs
that they're ready.

244
00:17:36,863 --> 00:17:41,508
You know, and whether they're worthy
of redemption or not is a whole other story.

245
00:17:41,774 --> 00:17:44,760
But you're not picking it up from me,
because it's not my time yet.

246
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:48,812
I'll be the last Fallen
you'll redeem, Aaron.

247
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:52,902
Comes with the gig.

248
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,559
Welcome.
There's a bedroom for you upstairs.

249
00:18:02,889 --> 00:18:04,097
Come on, Gabe,

250
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,668
The Nephilim
has escaped us again.

251
00:18:18,052 --> 00:18:20,657
You have disgraced us
with your incompetence.

252
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,611
You're the mightiest angels
on Heaven and Earth.

253
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,579
And you can't dispose
of one simple half-breed.

254
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:31,391
The Nephilim we could handle.
It's Camael that's the problem.

255
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:35,669
Mazarin, the energy signature
that drew us here,

256
00:18:35,974 --> 00:18:38,155
there's something different
about it.

257
00:18:38,812 --> 00:18:40,701
What if the traitor
is right?

258
00:18:41,346 --> 00:18:44,431
What is this Nephilim he's been dragging
all over the country really is the Redeemer?

259
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:46,061
There is no Reedemer,
Sachael.

260
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,304
It is the Powers' mission
to eradicate all of the Nephilim.

261
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:53,612
This one is no different
from the rest.

262
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,404
Now, when we catch up
with the little bastard,
and we will,

263
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,770
the prophecy will become
a dead issue.

264
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:07,440
You've been killing a lot
of your old friends lately.

265
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,408
I take no pleasure in it.

266
00:19:10,478 --> 00:19:14,119
Yeah, that's what you used to say
when you used to kill us Fallen.

267
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:16,535
It was true then, as well.

268
00:19:18,752 --> 00:19:19,937
So how's he doing?

269
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,559
He's struggling.

270
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:28,122
His angelic and human desires
are at constant odds.

271
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:33,412
Yeah, well...
all Nephilim are like that the first few years.

272
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:35,708
It'll get better.

273
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,631
It's getting worse.

274
00:19:41,197 --> 00:19:43,532
Maybe you're just
working him too hard.

275
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:57,234
You're new here,
ain'tcha?

276
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:58,946
Er... Yeah.

277
00:19:59,744 --> 00:20:03,509
Then he went out back
with Gina for, like, 15 minutes.

278
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,635
Gina?

279
00:20:06,512 --> 00:20:07,571
The barmaid.

280
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,163
He doesn't
even know her name.

281
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,805
Damn, man.

282
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:15,688
You're all right.
What's with the threads,
though?

283
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:16,838
Threads?

284
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,679
Oh, you mean my clothes.

285
00:20:20,629 --> 00:20:21,966
I like the way you talk.

286
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,265
- The way I what?
- The way I what?

287
00:20:24,664 --> 00:20:26,905
So, you're
a gambling man, huh?

288
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:37,468
You up for a game?

289
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,314
So how does one
play this game?

290
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:46,337
Hold your horses, chief.
We only play for money.

291
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,331
I have neither money
nor horses.

292
00:20:48,812 --> 00:20:51,694
- But I'll wager you a night with Gina...
- We could do that.

293
00:20:52,222 --> 00:20:53,864
for your mode
of transportation.

294
00:20:54,439 --> 00:20:55,518
My bike?

295
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,192
Okay, here.

296
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,232
I smell a fight.

297
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,634
You better come through
once you lose.

298
00:21:07,885 --> 00:21:09,715
Teach him
some manners, buddy!

299
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:13,554
It's goin' down.

300
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,122
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

301
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:32,484
Wait a minute now!

302
00:21:32,601 --> 00:21:34,384
You don't mean
my bike, man!

303
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,812
We had a deal,
didn't we...

304
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,501
man?

305
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,846
You want my bike?
Come take it.

306
00:22:21,814 --> 00:22:22,866
Bad dreams again?

307
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,771
You ever have nightmares?

308
00:22:25,736 --> 00:22:26,585
Sometimes.

309
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:30,242
You know how to stop them?

310
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,466
All you have to do is wake up.

311
00:22:40,786 --> 00:22:41,446
Morning.

312
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:42,581
Good morning.

313
00:22:57,946 --> 00:22:59,287
I've never seen
him sleep before.

314
00:22:59,781 --> 00:23:00,813
He's not sleeping.

315
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:02,442
He's healing.

316
00:23:03,267 --> 00:23:05,164
Angelfire wounds
can be bad news.

317
00:23:05,947 --> 00:23:07,948
In time,
even a little nick
would have killed him.

318
00:23:09,103 --> 00:23:09,639
Don't worry.

319
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:11,682
By tonight,
he'll be good as new.

320
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:23,478
Mmm, I love waffles.

321
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,252
Thanks.

322
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:39,116
I haven't had a...
real breakfast
in what seems like forever.

323
00:23:41,034 --> 00:23:42,436
You miss
your parents, huh?

324
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,818
I just haven't seen them
in a really long time.

325
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:48,382
I wish there was
a way I could...

326
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:52,114
get a hold of them
and just
tell them that
I'm okay, you know?

327
00:23:52,506 --> 00:23:52,960
I know.

328
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:55,640
But it's safer
for them this way.

329
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,209
Do you know who
my real father
and mother are?

330
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,869
The Fallen don't
exactly advertise it
when one of them
becomes a daddy.

331
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:12,179
It's a good way
to get the Powers
all over your ass.

332
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:15,107
Yeah.

333
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,334
Camael pretty much
said the same thing.

334
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:18,407
Yeah.

335
00:24:20,428 --> 00:24:23,954
Hey, um...
Do you think it would
be all right if I...

336
00:24:24,924 --> 00:24:26,904
went by the, uh,
college
and, uh,

337
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,894
just checked out
a couple of the classes?

338
00:24:30,162 --> 00:24:32,801
Well, you're a big boy.
You don't need
my permission.

339
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:35,018
It's just that Camael
never lets me

340
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,317
go anywhere
or do anything.

341
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,373
You're in Ariel's house now.
And I say you can do
whatever you want.

342
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:45,777
Just no angel stuff.

343
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:52,824
Angels.
Warring amongst themselves
because of mankind.

344
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:58,182
Lucifer's ambition
sprang from envy
that angels

345
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:01,443
were no longer God's
favorite creation.

346
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,270
At the beginning
of Milton's epic,

347
00:25:05,228 --> 00:25:07,609
he has suffered
a crushing defeat.

348
00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:10,107
Lucifer and his followers

349
00:25:11,198 --> 00:25:13,943
had been banished
from Heaven forever.

350
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,787
We see him struggling
with self-doubt.

351
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:21,908
We see he has hopes
and fears,

352
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:24,406
just like us.

353
00:25:25,407 --> 00:25:27,765
We identify with him.

354
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,322
Yes?

355
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:33,700
So, the devil...
he's a good guy?

356
00:25:35,828 --> 00:25:39,840
Well...
he's certainly sympathetic.

357
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:43,758
Lucifer sees himself
as a victim.

358
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,634
And it's fair to question
whether the Rebellion

359
00:25:49,232 --> 00:25:53,642
was his design,
or pre-ordained destiny.

360
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:54,921
Wait a second.

361
00:25:56,593 --> 00:25:59,092
Are you saying that Lucifer was

362
00:25:59,878 --> 00:26:01,848
created to rebel?

363
00:26:02,857 --> 00:26:04,218
Is that so hard to believe?

364
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:07,886
What is good without evil?

365
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:11,698
Does doing the right thing

366
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:14,826
have any meaning

367
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:17,888
if there is
no alternative?

368
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:20,773
But that doesn't make
any sense.

369
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:26,072
Even if Lucifer
was destined to become
the epitome of evil,

370
00:26:28,594 --> 00:26:31,363
he made the choice
to follow that path.

371
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:48,452
♫ It's never gonna be ♫

372
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,725
♫ Normal ♫
♫ You and me ♫

373
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:56,367
♫ What you're signing up for
is a storm at sea ♫

374
00:26:57,704 --> 00:27:00,719
You have no idea
how much I miss you,
Azazel.

375
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,283
I'm so glad
you got back.

376
00:27:04,846 --> 00:27:05,503
I know.

377
00:27:09,652 --> 00:27:11,904
Well, gotta go.

378
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,270
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

379
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,393
- You just got here.
- Yep.

380
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:24,041
I've got something
I need to take care of.

381
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:25,515
What things?

382
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,639
The Redeemer's arrived.

383
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,877
Ariel contacted me
a few months ago.

384
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:42,012
Really?

385
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:44,299
Where is she?

386
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:50,192
Where is she?

387
00:27:57,096 --> 00:28:00,439
She lives in this college town
200 miles from here.

388
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,035
Good, then that's
where I'm going.

389
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,712
You know,
your speech has improved,
but your clothes suck.

390
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,413
You need real ones.

391
00:28:09,987 --> 00:28:12,791
Angelic robes aren't
as stylish
as they used to be.

392
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:16,556
I'm sure I'll find you
something that fits.

393
00:28:23,388 --> 00:28:24,233
Whose are these?

394
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:28,116
I don't know.
An old boyfriend.
Or a husband, maybe.

395
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:30,908
You've been locked up
for 5,000 years.

396
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:32,797
I have my needs.

397
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:36,867
It's not like fidelity
was ever your strong suit.

398
00:28:40,738 --> 00:28:41,969
Oh, wow, okay.

399
00:28:43,858 --> 00:28:46,333
Thanks for letting me
sit in, though.
That was really cool.

400
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:47,515
It's not a problem.

401
00:28:48,171 --> 00:28:51,174
- I don't know, I just kind of thought you might like
to sit in on it.
-
Hey, um...

402
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:54,311
I don't mean to be rude.
Can I just...
Can I catch up with you in,
like, one second?

403
00:28:54,312 --> 00:28:55,270
- Of course.
- Sorry.

404
00:28:58,472 --> 00:28:59,235
Excuse me.

405
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:04,502
I just wanted to apologize
for talking out of turn
back there.

406
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:10,198
Not at all.
I admire your passion
on the subject,
Mr. Corbett.

407
00:29:10,199 --> 00:29:11,770
- Correct?
- Yes. Yes.

408
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:15,430
Um, and thank you
for letting me sit in
on your class, Dr. Grasic.

409
00:29:16,625 --> 00:29:19,359
So...
are you a religious zealot,

410
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,479
or just a die-hard
Milton fan?

411
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,787
Uh, neither.
Um, I've actually

412
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:28,677
- never read Paradise Lost.
- Shame on you.

413
00:29:30,906 --> 00:29:32,161
Anyway, I was thinking about

414
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,208
what you said about Lucifer
and his destiny,
and it goes against...

415
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,353
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I have
no time.

416
00:29:40,303 --> 00:29:43,998
But I spend
most of my evenings
at the library.

417
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:48,340
If you'd like to come by,
I'd be happy to continue
our discussion.

418
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,639
Hi.

419
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:08,689
Come here.

420
00:30:15,878 --> 00:30:17,579
- How was work?
- It was great.

421
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,910
I didn't even have
to use my healing magic
on anyone today.

422
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:23,549
You use your healing magic
on the job?

423
00:30:24,707 --> 00:30:27,886
- Aren't you worried about the Powers?
- Oh, I'm always worried about the Powers.

424
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:32,144
But if I have a chance
at saving a life, to me it's worth it.

425
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:35,390
Besides,
I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

426
00:30:40,736 --> 00:30:42,261
It's a protective rune.

427
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,721
It's not strong enough
to mask a redemption
but

428
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,797
it's good for
a little interference.

429
00:30:48,184 --> 00:30:49,662
You know, in a pinch.

430
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:53,225
Keep it.
I've got dozens of them.

431
00:30:54,597 --> 00:30:54,879
Thanks.

432
00:31:03,812 --> 00:31:05,079
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

433
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:06,616
What do you mean?

434
00:31:08,891 --> 00:31:10,100
By redeeming the Fallen?

435
00:31:13,185 --> 00:31:14,006
I don't know.

436
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:16,962
What do you think?

437
00:31:18,105 --> 00:31:18,715
I don't know.

438
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:25,605
Camael's always drilled it
into my head
that it's my destiny.

439
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,418
But just because
I'm meant to do something,
does that

440
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:31,799
make it
the right thing to do?

441
00:31:35,542 --> 00:31:41,149
What if the Earth...
I don't know,
needs angels?

442
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:45,861
And I'm just...
taking them away?

443
00:31:48,911 --> 00:31:49,498
Aaron...

444
00:31:51,738 --> 00:31:53,052
this is your mission.

445
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,629
Now, whether
it's right or wrong
is for you to decide.

446
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:00,500
And I think,
until you know,

447
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,593
you should keep your gift
to yourself.

448
00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:06,619
Because what you're doing
is far too important.

449
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:09,130
You have to believe
in it.

450
00:32:13,788 --> 00:32:15,688
That's my two cents.

451
00:32:20,193 --> 00:32:21,260
See your I.D.?

452
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:27,084
- Can you hold these?
- Yeah.

453
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:27,964
There you go.

454
00:32:28,773 --> 00:32:30,157
- You got that?
- Yeah.

455
00:32:30,822 --> 00:32:33,520
- You're 21?
- No, but my sister is.

456
00:32:37,215 --> 00:32:38,646
One for you. Yep.

457
00:32:38,846 --> 00:32:41,251
There you go.
Okay.
You guys ready?

458
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:45,463
Yeah!
Okay, let's do this!
Woo!
Yep!
Cheers.
Cheers.

459
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:53,833
Yo, aren't you drinking?

460
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:56,073
I'm not really much
of a drinker.

461
00:32:57,692 --> 00:32:59,451
He's the designated driver.

462
00:33:00,132 --> 00:33:01,973
Didn't you guys
walk here?
Yeah.

463
00:33:05,618 --> 00:33:07,413
Don't you guys
have classes
in the morning?

464
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,777
Does that make
any difference? Class?
Class?

465
00:33:11,778 --> 00:33:15,001
You guys...
Take one drink!
It's right there!
Come on!

466
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,954
One shot won't hurt you.
Man up.
You can't waste
alcohol, man. Man up.

467
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,101
Drink it.
Do it! Woo!
Leave it.
Yeah!

468
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,398
Just one shot!
He's got it
right there.
One shot. One shot.

469
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:31,842
Ooh, you're not
gonna puke, are you?

470
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,801
Okay, we're gonna
grab some air.

471
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,184
Ten bucks says
we don't see
either one of them
again tonight.

472
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:50,545
So, how was
your first day
of college?

473
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,685
It was great.
Thanks.

474
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:20,933
- Chloe.
- What is it?

475
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:26,385
Just...

476
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:30,198
You don't want
to get involved with me.

477
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,068
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

478
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:39,449
- Nothing.
- Then is something wrong with me?

479
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:43,566
'Cause I've been
practically throwing
myself at you all day.

480
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:11,849
Aaron!

481
00:35:17,277 --> 00:35:18,227
No!

482
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,578
Wait, dude. Chill.

483
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,420
We were just
messing around.

484
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:33,071
Chloe.

Oh, Mr. Corbett.

495
00:36:59,353 --> 00:37:03,201
- I wasn't sure
you'd still be here.
- The library doesn't close
until midnight.

496
00:37:04,452 --> 00:37:07,396
The staff always
has to chase me out.

497
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:12,593
Yeah.

498
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:16,015
What can you tell me
about the Nephilim?

499
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:29,875
It's widely accepted
that the Nephilim
were killed
in the Great Flood.

500
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:33,930
They were powerful beings,

501
00:37:33,931 --> 00:37:37,438
very often portrayed
as giants.
Monsters.

502
00:37:38,912 --> 00:37:43,815
Have you ever...
heard of a Nephilim
called the Redeemer?

503
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:48,496
I have.

504
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,417
I'm surprised that
you know of him, though.

505
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,174
It's quite
an obscure prophecy.
Very controversial.

506
00:38:04,008 --> 00:38:06,566
The Redeemer was a vehicle
for forgiveness.

507
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:13,561
He or she has the power
to pardon anyone
of any sin,

508
00:38:13,562 --> 00:38:15,684
no matter how great.

509
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:22,907
But there are clues
to something else
in the prophecy,

510
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:29,743
hints that he may serve
another, darker purpose.

511
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,595
What purpose?
We don't know.

512
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:41,364
All we know is
that for every claim
that praises his arrival,

513
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:46,847
there is another
that speaks of it
in terror.

514
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:52,137
We are not even sure
if he is a force of good...

515
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:54,661
or evil.

516
00:39:13,502 --> 00:39:13,948
Aaron.

517
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:18,416
Ariel.

518
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:21,736
How you feeling?

519
00:39:28,522 --> 00:39:30,493
Much better. Thank you.

520
00:39:31,865 --> 00:39:36,499
I'm glad you're up.
I got called in to work,
and somebody's
gotta walk Gabriel.

521
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:40,450
Oh, and I promised him
some ice cream.

522
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,948
Where's Aaron?

523
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:46,139
He's hanging with
his friends from college.

524
00:39:46,687 --> 00:39:48,189
His friends?
Mm-hmm.

525
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:52,048
How long have I been out?

526
00:39:52,822 --> 00:39:56,810
Don't worry.
He's fine.
You can't protect him
all the time, you know?

527
00:39:57,464 --> 00:39:59,611
Yes, I can.
I must.

528
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,705
- He's an irresponsible child. And that temper will get someone...
- He's 19,

529
00:40:04,162 --> 00:40:06,860
he's a good kid,
and he needs some normalcy
in his life.

530
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,296
You gotta remember,
he's human.

531
00:40:11,633 --> 00:40:14,601
Half human.
That's more than you are.

532
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,360
Who are you to talk?

533
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:24,905
The Nephilim are monsters.

534
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:28,001
Why?

535
00:40:29,687 --> 00:40:30,461
What did they do?

536
00:40:34,942 --> 00:40:35,740
What is that?

537
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:40,740
It's nothing.

538
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:43,567
Where did you get it?

539
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,688
My friend gave it to me.

540
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:52,091
What are you doing?
I know what this is.

541
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,710
Protective rune
used to hide yourself.

542
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:00,851
To hide yourself?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

543
00:41:01,203 --> 00:41:04,733
You hide yourself
from angels.

544
00:41:09,795 --> 00:41:13,842
Yes.
It all makes sense now.

545
00:41:14,546 --> 00:41:16,493
I don't know what
you're talking about.

546
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:21,521
Of course you don't.
You never know
who might be listening.

547
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:25,111
But I know what you are.

548
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:32,683
And I'm just like you.
We are brothers, Aaron.

549
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:35,287
Brothers in the Order.

550
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,858
The Order?
Yeah.

551
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,166
I know why you're here.

552
00:41:44,386 --> 00:41:46,369
You do?
Yes.

553
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:52,145
We both know that
the angels are real.

554
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:58,300
We know that
they walk among us.

555
00:42:03,322 --> 00:42:07,674
Tell me...
would you like to see one?

556
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:10,149
Yes?

557
00:42:19,695 --> 00:42:21,337
All this
on a teacher's salary?

558
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:27,504
My family
has a long history
of dealing
in ancient artifacts.

559
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,270
What I'm about
to show you,

560
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:41,977
you can never
breathe a word about,
for your own safety.

561
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:49,415
You have nothing
to fear from me.

562
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,564
But as I'm sure
you know,
some of our members

563
00:42:54,694 --> 00:42:56,348
are overly cautious.

564
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,190
Do I have your word?

565
00:43:05,913 --> 00:43:06,406
Come.

566
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:22,146
There she is.
Come.

567
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:29,304
Child?

568
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:33,292
We have a guest.

569
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,054
Show us your wings.

570
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,608
Your beautiful wings.

571
00:43:57,489 --> 00:44:01,102
Breathtaking...isn't it?

572
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:08,840
Now turn around.
Show us your pretty face.

573
00:44:26,154 --> 00:44:28,113
Isn't she beautiful?

574
00:44:33,636 --> 00:44:34,472
Vilma!

575
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,880
How do you know her name?

576
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:45,725
That's impossible... what is she doing here?

577
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:48,894
She's quite comfortable here.

578
00:44:49,336 --> 00:44:51,312
I've taken excellent care.

579
00:44:51,857 --> 00:44:53,019
She's a prisoner.

580
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:57,137
She's the only living Nephilim.

581
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:00,891
Would you rather her

582
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,435
be strapped to a table in a laboratory somewhere?

583
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,008
I'm taking her out of here.

584
00:45:08,645 --> 00:45:09,348
No.

585
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,205
You'll do no such thing

586
00:45:19,188 --> 00:45:22,164
It's time for you to leave my house.

587
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,289
Right now.

588
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:31,294
Lukas...

589
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,002
God!

590
00:45:38,624 --> 00:45:40,290
Those markings.

591
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,168
Wipe away those runes.

592
00:46:03,731 --> 00:46:04,930
I don't want to.

593
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:05,663
Do it.

594
00:46:09,459 --> 00:46:10,747
Do it now!

595
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:31,808
You are... the Redeemer.

596
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:34,378
Wipe away those runes.

597
00:46:36,635 --> 00:46:37,265
Do it!

598
00:46:47,194 --> 00:46:47,690
Vilma.

599
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:50,421
It's me.

600
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:54,808
Vilma, it's Aaron.

601
00:46:55,911 --> 00:46:57,192
We're going to get out of here.

602
00:47:08,178 --> 00:47:09,166
It's okay.

603
00:47:09,418 --> 00:47:10,395
You're safe now.

604
00:47:11,266 --> 00:47:12,147
I promise.

605
00:48:06,032 --> 00:48:06,654
You all right?

606
00:48:08,007 --> 00:48:08,488
Yeah.

607
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:09,902
Vilma, say something, please.

608
00:48:12,128 --> 00:48:12,913
You're like me.

609
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,363
How is that possible?

610
00:48:15,992 --> 00:48:16,562
I don't know.

611
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:18,101
I don't know what the hell's going on.

612
00:48:18,464 --> 00:48:19,293
Aaron!

613
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,853
Camael. It's okay.

614
00:48:24,775 --> 00:48:26,255
This is Camael.
He's my friend.

615
00:48:26,359 --> 00:48:27,758
Hey! I rember you.

616
00:48:27,795 --> 00:48:28,853
This girl is Nephilim.

617
00:48:29,564 --> 00:48:30,659
Where did she come from?

618
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:33,339
It's a long story.

619
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,960
You lost control.

620
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:38,800
The Powers are coming.
You must leave now.

621
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:42,257
No. I'm going to stay,
and I'm going to fight.

622
00:48:42,745 --> 00:48:46,032
If you don't leave now,
they will kill all of us.

623
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:48,097
And if I do, they'll kill you?

624
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,359
I have pledged to lay down my life for you.

625
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,173
That is what I intend to do.

626
00:48:53,454 --> 00:48:54,498
What is going on?

627
00:48:55,802 --> 00:48:59,007
Aaron, you must protect
this child, as you once
need my help.

628
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:01,227
Run!

629
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:10,615
Take care of the traitor.

630
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,392
I'm going after the Nephilim.

631
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,356
Well, I'll be damned.

632
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:58,006
Two for the price of one.
It must be my lucky day.

633
00:49:59,012 --> 00:50:00,219
I got to admit, kid.

634
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,521
You gave us a run for our money.

635
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:07,219
But this is how it ends.

636
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:13,963
Leave the children alone, Nathaniel.

637
00:50:15,517 --> 00:50:16,169
Azazel.

638
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,045
Don't you have some puppies to go kick or something?

639
00:50:22,571 --> 00:50:24,644
This can't be you.
This isn't real.

640
00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:26,174
Oh, it's real.

641
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,719
What could I possibly do to convince you?

642
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:35,968
Oh. Aren't I?

643
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:54,683
You guys all right?

644
00:50:57,565 --> 00:50:58,690
What, are you scared of me?

645
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:00,748
I just saved your asses.

646
00:51:36,203 --> 00:51:36,736
Who are you?

647
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,142
I'm Azazel.

648
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:40,289
Glad to meet you.

649
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:43,367
Are you one of the Fallen?

650
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,025
I'm Azazel.

651
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,128
You never heard of me?

652
00:51:48,618 --> 00:51:50,417
Yeah, I'm one of the Fallen.
I'm the Fallen.

653
00:51:53,209 --> 00:51:54,808
Your girl looks a little
freaked out, man.

654
00:51:55,703 --> 00:51:58,034
Yeah, well,
it's been a rough night.

655
00:51:58,721 --> 00:52:00,920
Yeah, well you know what?
It's only going to get worse.

656
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:03,372
We need to get off these streets,
go underground. Let's go.

657
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:10,299
Let's go! They can smell you.
They can feel you. Come on.

658
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:12,531
We got to go.

659
00:52:12,686 --> 00:52:15,572
Aaron. He just killed that man.

660
00:52:15,728 --> 00:52:17,874
Vilma, I know what you're
going through right now.

661
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,466
But he's one of the Fallen.
He's on our side.

662
00:52:20,577 --> 00:52:21,576
On our side?

663
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:24,674
Whose side are we on?
Are we the good guys
or the bad guys?

664
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:30,650
If we survive this night, I promise you
I will tell you everything I know.

665
00:52:31,675 --> 00:52:32,874
But right now,
we've got to go.

666
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:34,343
Okay?

667
00:52:35,942 --> 00:52:36,801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

668
00:52:56,141 --> 00:52:57,355
Hey, could I ask
you something?

669
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:03,762
How did you end up
in that nutjob's attic?

670
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:09,288
Well, it all started
on my 18th birthday.

671
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:13,423
Strange things started
happening to me.

672
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:15,891
I was getting these headaches,

673
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,177
and I was hearing voices.

674
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,366
And then...
And the angels came.

675
00:53:24,813 --> 00:53:27,248
They're so majestic
at first, you know.

676
00:53:27,752 --> 00:53:28,825
So beautiful.

677
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:31,494
Real angels from Heaven.

678
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:35,245
Then they attacked.

679
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,649
They killed my aunt.

680
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:42,008
Burned down the house.

681
00:53:43,414 --> 00:53:44,710
Somehow, I got away.

682
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,384
The angels who did that
to you,

683
00:53:48,354 --> 00:53:49,709
they're calledthe Powers.

684
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:53,173
They are the same angels

685
00:53:54,305 --> 00:53:56,704
that are chasing us right now.

686
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:59,368
I just ran.
Hid in the woods.

687
00:54:00,865 --> 00:54:02,441
I thought I was dead,
for sure.

688
00:54:02,841 --> 00:54:06,749
I stopped this man in the woods
and asked him for help, but...

689
00:54:07,216 --> 00:54:10,502
he pulled out a gun
and shot me with a tranquilizer.

690
00:54:11,621 --> 00:54:14,552
Lukas didn't hurt me or
anything, though, he, uh...

691
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,862
He was kind.

692
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:22,035
You probably won't understand.
It's not like I had anywhere else to go.

693
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:25,527
Until you came.

694
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:30,516
So, thanks for coming
to my rescue.

695
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:35,795
Maybe you can tell me now why angels
are trying to kill us?

696
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:37,021
What did we do?

697
00:54:38,057 --> 00:54:40,002
It's because we were
born Nephilim.

698
00:54:41,392 --> 00:54:44,752
They're on a mission from
the Creator to cleanse
the Earth of...

699
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:48,162
our kind.
We're abominations.

700
00:54:49,897 --> 00:54:51,009
Abominations.

701
00:54:51,337 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah, you're freaks. It sucks.
Can we all stop feeling sorry for ourselves now?

702
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:56,226
We're alive,

703
00:54:57,236 --> 00:54:58,929
which is more than can
be said for Nathaniel.

704
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:00,616
Hey, listen. Um...

705
00:55:01,425 --> 00:55:03,774
I want to thank you
for what you did back there.

706
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,313
If you hadn't shown up,
we might have been...

707
00:55:05,425 --> 00:55:07,369
Hey.
You're the Redeemer.

708
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:09,776
What kind of Fallen would I be
if I didn't look out for you?

709
00:55:11,946 --> 00:55:14,561
Hey, we got to find out
what happened to Camael.

710
00:55:15,837 --> 00:55:17,997
Camael? Ah, I wouldn't
worry about him.

711
00:55:19,307 --> 00:55:19,825
What do you mean?

712
00:55:20,836 --> 00:55:21,657
Camael's dead.

713
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:34,252
I can't believe
Camael's dead.

714
00:55:41,146 --> 00:55:42,384
What is the big deal?

715
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,211
So Camael's troops finally turned on him.
That's a good thing.

716
00:55:47,765 --> 00:55:49,824
He wasn't with the Powers anymore.
He...

717
00:55:52,367 --> 00:55:54,085
He's been protecting me,

718
00:55:54,944 --> 00:55:56,308
ever since I turned.

719
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,209
He was my friend.

720
00:56:02,081 --> 00:56:03,015
Your friend?

721
00:56:03,975 --> 00:56:05,769
We are talking about
the same Camael, right?

722
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,390
Tall, bald,
no sense of humor?

723
00:56:16,752 --> 00:56:18,205
This is all my fault.

724
00:56:19,632 --> 00:56:21,236
No, Aaron,

725
00:56:21,691 --> 00:56:23,055
you were trying
to help me.

726
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,480
That's what Camael
would've wanted.

727
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:28,613
I didn't have to
do it like that.

728
00:56:31,116 --> 00:56:32,455
I lost control.

729
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:38,127
And I don't know
what we're going
to do now.

730
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:42,371
Look, I've got an idea.

731
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,315
Why don't we get
out of town?

732
00:56:49,654 --> 00:56:50,829
Lay low for a while.

733
00:56:52,383 --> 00:56:54,214
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

734
00:56:56,033 --> 00:56:56,715
Where is that?

735
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,660
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

736
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:07,092
It's about time
you met him.

737
00:57:22,702 --> 00:57:25,367
Hey!
Don't move!
Stay right there!

738
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:26,441
Don't move!

739
00:57:28,298 --> 00:57:28,765
Get back here!

740
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:31,001
Come back here and get down on your knees!

741
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:33,022
Give me your wallet.
Your wallet! All right.

742
00:57:33,603 --> 00:57:34,525
Hurry up!
All right!

743
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:37,519
And your watch.
Your watch, too!
Hurry!
Come on!

744
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,621
It's not nice
to steal from people.

745
00:58:08,978 --> 00:58:09,420
Hey.

746
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:11,972
What is wrong with you?

747
00:58:12,313 --> 00:58:13,551
It's kinda harsh, isn't it?

748
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,833
I'm not a guardian angel.

749
00:58:19,301 --> 00:58:20,956
I'm an avenging angel.

750
00:58:21,777 --> 00:58:22,977
This is who I am.

751
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,680
The world needs both.

752
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,851
Got us a car.
Wanna drive?

753
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,449
We're not seriously going
off with this guy, are we?

754
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,287
He can protect us.

755
00:58:40,778 --> 00:58:41,523
We need him.

756
00:58:42,862 --> 00:58:44,175
We need somebody.

757
00:58:46,304 --> 00:58:47,252
Any day now.

758
00:58:53,012 --> 00:58:53,770
Just hold on.

759
00:59:00,025 --> 00:59:01,326
What is the Light Bringer?

760
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:03,158
Not what. Who.

761
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:05,520
He's a fallen angel,
just like me.

762
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:09,077
And his name
is the Light Bringer?

763
00:59:09,355 --> 00:59:10,479
Is your name the Redeemer?

764
00:59:11,035 --> 00:59:11,830
Don't be an idiot.

765
00:59:14,015 --> 00:59:16,503
He doesn't have a name
in a traditional sense.

766
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:19,648
We call him "the Light Bringer"
because that's what he does.

767
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:24,044
He brings us light.
He's an oracle. He's a seer.

768
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,270
Are you sure
that he can help us?

769
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:30,757
He can't help me,
but he can help you.

770
00:59:31,451 --> 00:59:34,091
Remember that prophecY about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

771
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:37,378
He wrote it.

772
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:08,801
You'll find that
quite impossible, traitor.

773
01:00:14,245 --> 01:00:14,978
Aaron?

774
01:00:16,102 --> 01:00:19,626
I suspect we'll have him
or his remains within the hour.

775
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:23,529
He can't last long
without your protection.

776
01:00:26,012 --> 01:00:26,985
Mazarin.

777
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:32,353
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

778
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:35,915
The prophecy is real.

779
01:00:36,546 --> 01:00:39,010
No, Camael.
It's a lie.

780
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,165
I do hope Nathaniel
brings the boy back alive.

781
01:00:44,352 --> 01:00:46,878
I'd love to make you watch
while I slit his throat

782
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:48,925
so that when you die,

783
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:52,386
you'll know for certain
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

784
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,485
Mazarin.

785
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:01,679
This is not what
the Powers stand for.

786
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,607
You dare tell me
the Powers' mission?

787
01:01:06,087 --> 01:01:09,195
Are you under the misconception
that you're still one of us?

788
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,212
You turned your back on us, Camael.
You turned your back on the Creator.

789
01:01:14,702 --> 01:01:16,635
And you'll pay
for your sins, traitor.

790
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,399
What I want to know is...

791
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:30,168
what in the hell were you thinking
showing her to anyone?

792
01:01:31,451 --> 01:01:33,105
But he was Nephilim.

793
01:01:34,735 --> 01:01:37,653
You didn't know that
when you brought him
up here, did you?

794
01:01:38,209 --> 01:01:40,255
I thought
he was one of us.

795
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:43,716
Oh, right.
Of course.

796
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:49,741
Because the Order is just teeming
with teenage members, isn't it?

797
01:01:52,094 --> 01:01:53,963
Please, put that down.

798
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:57,096
It's 4th century.

799
01:01:57,273 --> 01:01:58,485
Really?

800
01:01:59,658 --> 01:02:00,870
It's exquisite.

801
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:10,066
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that precious to you?

802
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:12,409
What about this?

803
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:18,182
Haven't I lost
enough tonight?

804
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,843
It's not about what you've lost,
Dr. Grasic.

805
01:02:23,626 --> 01:02:26,418
You've lost nothing.
We let you keep her.

806
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:29,258
She was never yours.He's the Redeemer!

807
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:35,483
What?

808
01:02:36,224 --> 01:02:37,243
Yes.

809
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:47,898
The boy who freed her...

810
01:02:50,736 --> 01:02:54,902
he has the markings
of the Redeemer.

811
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,516
Start from the beginning.

812
01:03:12,412 --> 01:03:14,968
Is that look in your eye
meant to intimidate me?

813
01:03:17,468 --> 01:03:20,283
Now, I admit there was a time
when it might have,

814
01:03:21,657 --> 01:03:23,379
but those days are over,
old friend.

815
01:03:24,768 --> 01:03:25,564
Mazarin.

816
01:03:26,194 --> 01:03:27,472
What is it, Sachael?

817
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,623
It's Nathaniel.

818
01:03:42,370 --> 01:03:46,092
He's not coming back.
He's dead.

819
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:50,485
That half-breed
killed Nathaniel?

820
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:52,748
Somebody did.

821
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:07,142
Where is he now, Camael?
Tell me.

822
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:15,544
You know,
over the millennia
we served together,

823
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:19,618
many of the Fallen
said they would never
give up their children.

824
01:04:20,879 --> 01:04:24,471
But they always did,
thanks to us.

825
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:27,082
No, thanks to you.

826
01:04:29,231 --> 01:04:30,675
Where is the Nephilim?

827
01:05:04,644 --> 01:05:07,144
So who is this
Jesus character anyway?

828
01:05:10,388 --> 01:05:12,203
Seriously, I've been
seeing his name everywhere.

829
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:23,475
Well, um, a lot of people
think that he was the son of God.

830
01:05:28,808 --> 01:05:29,679
What's so funny?

831
01:05:32,086 --> 01:05:34,086
The Creator had a kid.

832
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:36,738
Well, do as I say,
not as I do, eh?

833
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,349
Did you seriously
not know that?

834
01:05:41,593 --> 01:05:43,260
Been out of the picture
for a while.

835
01:05:46,686 --> 01:05:47,427
How so?

836
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,986
Well, you probably heard
about what happened
in the old days.

837
01:05:51,375 --> 01:05:54,518
About how the Creator
flooded the planet
because we contaminated

838
01:05:54,532 --> 01:05:56,664
his precious Earth
with half-breeds like you.

839
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:59,155
A bit of an overreaction,
if you ask me.

840
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:01,392
But, hey, mysterious ways
and all that.

841
01:06:02,403 --> 01:06:05,615
Wait. You mean,
like, Noah's Ark?

842
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:07,254
That flood?

843
01:06:07,927 --> 01:06:08,817
Yeah, that's right.

844
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,121
Noah.

845
01:06:11,905 --> 01:06:14,141
That guy could
really throw it down,
let me tell you.

846
01:06:16,183 --> 01:06:16,955
Anyways.

847
01:06:18,593 --> 01:06:21,545
Afterwards, your buddy Camael

848
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,268
and a few other half-wits
from the Powers

849
01:06:24,284 --> 01:06:26,861
decided they were going
to come down and tell us
things had to change.

850
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:29,443
I guess to prove
a point,

851
01:06:30,458 --> 01:06:32,440
they decided to make
an example of someone.

852
01:06:35,274 --> 01:06:36,324
I fought.

853
01:06:38,491 --> 01:06:39,800
Killed one of them.

854
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:43,571
Slashed this son of a bitch
Mazarin across the face.

855
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:44,930
It was beautiful.

856
01:06:46,731 --> 01:06:48,115
But in the end,

857
01:06:48,973 --> 01:06:49,918
they got me.

858
01:06:52,106 --> 01:06:53,959
Took me deep underground,

859
01:06:54,548 --> 01:06:55,555
chained me up,

860
01:06:56,538 --> 01:06:59,583
and left me for 5,000 years.

861
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:03,507
So you've been a prisoner, too.
Like me.

862
01:07:05,721 --> 01:07:06,073
Yeah.

863
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:10,826
Six months
in a luxury suite...

864
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:14,642
just like being chained
to a stone slab
for five millennia.

865
01:07:15,186 --> 01:07:16,286
Just like it.

866
01:07:17,874 --> 01:07:19,574
Don't talk to her
like that.

867
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:20,605
Or what?

868
01:07:26,350 --> 01:07:27,993
I'm just messin'
with you, kid.

869
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:29,347
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

870
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:32,043
I'm sure it must've been
very difficult for you.

871
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:34,799
I smell food.

872
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:36,046
What about food?

873
01:07:36,227 --> 01:07:37,728
Who wants to eat?
Want to stop for a bite?

874
01:07:38,594 --> 01:07:40,133
Well, we're kind of
on the run right now.

875
01:07:40,263 --> 01:07:40,825
You gotta eat.

876
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:44,089
I'm hungry. Who's hungry?
Let's vote.

877
01:07:45,122 --> 01:07:45,937
Me! I'm hungry!

878
01:07:46,388 --> 01:07:47,289
Me, too.

879
01:07:48,241 --> 01:07:49,311
I'm starving.

880
01:07:50,768 --> 01:07:52,103
Looks like you lose, chief.

881
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:01,811
All right, order up.

882
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,736
Oh... my... God.

883
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,322
What are these things
called again?

884
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:15,637
What?
French fries?

885
01:08:16,566 --> 01:08:18,400
French fries.
I gotta remember that.

886
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:21,733
Here, try 'em with ketchup.

887
01:08:33,854 --> 01:08:39,020
This is the best food
I've ever had
in the history of ever!

888
01:08:39,094 --> 01:08:41,724
Hey, we get it.
You like French fries.

889
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:46,061
This is the first meal
I've had in a long time.

890
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:49,338
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna enjoy it.
All right?

891
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:52,819
And lighten up...
Redeemer.

892
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:57,911
Why does he keep
calling you that?
Redeemer?

893
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,319
'Cause that's what he is.

894
01:09:00,775 --> 01:09:02,978
He sends us Fallen
back to Heaven.
Show her your arms.

895
01:09:04,904 --> 01:09:06,182
Show her your arms.

896
01:09:14,004 --> 01:09:15,856
The names of the Redeemed.

897
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,634
These are all angels?

898
01:09:23,324 --> 01:09:25,046
And you send them
back to Heaven?

899
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:27,898
How?

900
01:09:30,009 --> 01:09:30,990
I don't know.

901
01:09:33,531 --> 01:09:37,346
Um... When I'm around them,
I get this, um...

902
01:09:38,627 --> 01:09:40,924
this weird feeling.

903
01:09:41,964 --> 01:09:44,020
It's hard to explain, really.
Um...

904
01:09:45,816 --> 01:09:46,927
I kinda...

905
01:09:48,983 --> 01:09:50,686
open myself up to them.

906
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:57,223
And then I usually...
take their hand and, uh...

907
01:10:00,116 --> 01:10:02,505
this weird energy
passes between us.

908
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,585
And then they're gone.

909
01:10:14,857 --> 01:10:16,617
Wow. Um...

910
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:18,876
Do it to him.

911
01:10:19,561 --> 01:10:22,172
What?
No, you keep that voodoo to yourself.

912
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,135
Don't you want
to go to Heaven?

913
01:10:24,551 --> 01:10:25,310
Hell, no.

914
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:28,496
If I liked it,
I wouldn't have rebelled
in the first place,
would I?

915
01:10:30,384 --> 01:10:32,718
Yeah, well, I'm not
really doing it anymore.

916
01:10:34,851 --> 01:10:35,980
Not right now.

917
01:10:37,351 --> 01:10:38,388
Why not?

918
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:42,169
There's just a lot I...
I still don't understand about it.

919
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,206
Plus, I'm not even sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

920
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:52,432
Aaron, how can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

921
01:10:54,302 --> 01:10:55,099
I don't know.

922
01:10:58,361 --> 01:11:00,009
But I've been having these...

923
01:11:01,806 --> 01:11:03,991
these weird dreams lately

924
01:11:05,628 --> 01:11:06,905
about the end
of the world...

925
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:12,387
and I'm the cause of it.

926
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:16,835
Damn, kid, you're a mess,
ain't you?

927
01:11:20,061 --> 01:11:20,913
Look at me.

928
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:26,065
Look at me.
When we get
to the Light Bringer,

929
01:11:26,231 --> 01:11:30,342
I promise you'll understand
yourself and your destiny

930
01:11:30,788 --> 01:11:32,547
a hell of a lot better.

931
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,362
More coffee?

932
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:39,214
Hello, sweetheart.
What's your name?

933
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,231
Suzie.

934
01:11:43,046 --> 01:11:46,416
Suzie.
That's such a pretty name.

935
01:11:47,768 --> 01:11:49,434
Saw you looking
at me earlier, Suzie.

936
01:11:50,512 --> 01:11:53,846
No, no. Don't be embarrassed.
Sometimes I can't stop looking at me.

937
01:11:55,735 --> 01:11:57,531
Let me ask you
a question, Suzie.

938
01:12:00,267 --> 01:12:03,175
Is there anywhere near here

939
01:12:04,397 --> 01:12:06,138
where you and I
could go, um...

940
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:08,212
talk?

941
01:12:15,782 --> 01:12:17,430
I'm going on a break.

942
01:12:17,782 --> 01:12:19,078
Yeah, all right.

943
01:12:21,538 --> 01:12:23,519
Catch you losers later.

944
01:12:53,031 --> 01:12:55,723
I've told you
everything I know.

945
01:13:04,287 --> 01:13:05,158
Hawkins.

946
01:13:06,806 --> 01:13:08,732
No. No teams.

947
01:13:09,436 --> 01:13:10,658
I hunt alone.

948
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:19,192
What do you want me
to do about the girl?

949
01:13:22,432 --> 01:13:23,562
Understood.

950
01:13:39,726 --> 01:13:42,781
Are you going to get
my Vilma back?

951
01:13:53,865 --> 01:13:54,717
Go on.

952
01:13:55,605 --> 01:13:56,976
I don't care.

953
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,387
I don't want to live
without her anyway.

954
01:14:11,055 --> 01:14:13,278
Do you believe
that things happen
for a reason?

955
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:16,944
You mean, like fate?

956
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:21,596
There's really
no other explanation
for all this, is there?

957
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,855
You and me?

958
01:14:24,747 --> 01:14:28,118
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

959
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:36,737
Everything makes
so much sense now.

960
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:40,996
The day you left,
people said you'd gone crazy

961
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:43,311
- and burned your house down.
- People said that?

962
01:14:44,377 --> 01:14:45,266
About me?

963
01:14:56,986 --> 01:14:58,764
You ever think
about going home?

964
01:15:01,151 --> 01:15:02,206
Yeah.

965
01:15:03,614 --> 01:15:04,762
All the time.

966
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,762
It's been a year now
and I just...

967
01:15:11,228 --> 01:15:15,636
I feel like I keep getting
further and further away.
You know?

968
01:15:16,435 --> 01:15:20,009
At least you have a family to go back to.
Someday.

969
01:15:23,513 --> 01:15:26,531
I wonder if this Light Bringer
knows anything about me.

970
01:15:27,177 --> 01:15:31,436
You know, maybe...
maybe I have a prophecy, too.

971
01:15:33,121 --> 01:15:34,640
Don't jinx yourself.

972
01:15:35,343 --> 01:15:36,343
Still got it.

973
01:15:40,395 --> 01:15:41,970
It's almost too easy,
isn't it?

974
01:15:43,062 --> 01:15:45,747
Mortal wenches.
God bless 'em.

975
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:49,714
You know, you really
shouldn't say that stuff.

976
01:15:50,769 --> 01:15:51,399
Why?

977
01:15:52,606 --> 01:15:54,791
Because it's derogatory
towards women.

978
01:15:56,754 --> 01:15:58,884
No, but I'm saying that
I like that they're easy.

979
01:16:01,596 --> 01:16:02,448
Weird.

980
01:16:03,855 --> 01:16:04,966
You kids ready to go?

981
01:16:07,003 --> 01:16:07,855
Come on, Gabe.

982
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:11,059
I'm riding in back
with Azazel.

983
01:16:15,608 --> 01:16:16,386
What is it?

984
01:16:19,719 --> 01:16:21,831
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head over.

985
01:16:22,815 --> 01:16:24,019
Let's go.

986
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:43,444
The aerospace manufacturer
pleaded guilty to two counts

987
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:45,508
of violating the Federal
Clean Water Act,

988
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:48,335
admitting dumping
industrial discharge
into the river.

989
01:16:48,780 --> 01:16:51,337
In addition to being placed
on probation for five years,

990
01:16:51,379 --> 01:16:54,063
the company agreed to pay
$1 million in fines

991
01:16:54,095 --> 01:16:57,236
and to contribute
another $11 million
for environmental
improvement projects.

992
01:16:57,290 --> 01:17:00,039
Good God,
what is happening
to this place?

993
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,205
Human beings used to care
about the Earth, you know?

994
01:17:03,612 --> 01:17:05,706
They used to appreciate
just how good they had it.

995
01:17:06,192 --> 01:17:08,619
Guess a lot has changed
in 5,000 years.

996
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:18,427
Will this Light Bringer
know who my father is?

997
01:17:20,206 --> 01:17:21,873
You sure that's something
you want to find out?

998
01:17:23,749 --> 01:17:26,102
Most Nephilim don't
want anything to do
with their fathers.

999
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,382
Human women can't
survive the births.

1000
01:17:31,027 --> 01:17:33,732
At first, we were like,
whoops, you know?

1001
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,382
But it didn't take us long
to figure out that, you know,

1002
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:39,735
getting one pregnant
was like handing down
a death sentence.

1003
01:17:40,703 --> 01:17:43,186
So they all die?
All our mothers?

1004
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:45,280
Every one of 'em.

1005
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:49,746
Your old man still sound
like someone you wanna
go fishing with?

1006
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:51,877
Play catch?

1007
01:17:51,988 --> 01:17:53,470
I just want to know
who he is.

1008
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,532
We're being followed.

1009
01:17:57,643 --> 01:17:58,384
What?

1010
01:17:59,644 --> 01:18:00,867
By who?

1011
01:18:01,497 --> 01:18:02,498
I don't know.

1012
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:05,096
Pull over.
Let me deal with it.

1013
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:10,825
It's time, traitor.

1014
01:18:11,622 --> 01:18:14,220
Time for you to say good-bye
to something you hold dear.

1015
01:18:17,629 --> 01:18:19,241
Perhaps your eyes.

1016
01:18:20,357 --> 01:18:23,970
No. There's a certain
nobility in blindness.

1017
01:18:24,785 --> 01:18:28,324
I could cut out your tongue,
but then once you're broken,

1018
01:18:28,754 --> 01:18:31,293
you wouldn't
be able to tell me
what I want to know.

1019
01:18:32,515 --> 01:18:33,460
Sachael.

1020
01:18:34,428 --> 01:18:35,706
I want to see his wings.

1021
01:18:35,736 --> 01:18:37,292
Mazarin, no.
You can't...

1022
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:38,398
That wasn't a request.

1023
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:40,288
Just do it.

1024
01:18:42,716 --> 01:18:43,450
Mazarin.

1025
01:18:45,133 --> 01:18:46,706
You are lost.

1026
01:18:47,539 --> 01:18:51,873
You do not serve
the Creator.

1027
01:18:58,326 --> 01:18:59,324
Mazarin.

1028
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:16,387
Mazarin.

1029
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:22,163
You are the one who's lost.

1030
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:23,975
And as for the Creator...

1031
01:19:24,882 --> 01:19:28,009
what I do now,
I do in his name.

1032
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:39,599
And now, you take
your true place
amongst the Fallen.

1033
01:20:03,576 --> 01:20:04,723
Looking for something?

1034
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:07,572
Anane.

1035
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:15,932
I picked up your scent
just outside of town,

1036
01:20:16,598 --> 01:20:18,355
and I've been following you
ever since.

1037
01:20:21,575 --> 01:20:22,851
How did you escape?

1038
01:20:23,892 --> 01:20:26,112
I am so sick of everybody
asking me that question.

1039
01:20:26,137 --> 01:20:27,210
Maybe I didn't escape.

1040
01:20:27,851 --> 01:20:31,199
Maybe the Creator decided
I was such a perfect specimen
he'd set me free.

1041
01:20:31,898 --> 01:20:32,675
Did he?

1042
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:36,689
That's not the point.
What do you want?

1043
01:20:38,281 --> 01:20:40,112
I want to know
if I'm worthy
of redemption.

1044
01:20:40,672 --> 01:20:43,503
I can tell that
you want it really bad.

1045
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:47,609
But I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that right now.

1046
01:20:50,772 --> 01:20:51,622
I see.

1047
01:20:53,732 --> 01:20:55,378
It's nothing personal, okay?

1048
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:56,284
I just...

1049
01:20:59,008 --> 01:21:00,784
I don't know
how much time
I have left.

1050
01:21:05,747 --> 01:21:07,134
Nathaniel did this to me.

1051
01:21:08,392 --> 01:21:09,576
He was looking for you.

1052
01:21:13,887 --> 01:21:15,533
It's too late for me
to be healed.

1053
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,058
The wound is too old,
too deep.

1054
01:21:20,113 --> 01:21:21,408
It's killing me.

1055
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,330
You know what happens
to angels when they die
without redemption?

1056
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:29,571
We don't have souls.
Not like you do.

1057
01:21:31,222 --> 01:21:33,497
There's...
There's no Heaven for us.

1058
01:21:34,070 --> 01:21:35,458
No Hell.
Just...

1059
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,830
Just nothingness.

1060
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:40,087
Forever.

1061
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:45,290
And that scares me
more than anything.

1062
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:47,844
Yeah, well,
tough luck, Anane.

1063
01:21:47,973 --> 01:21:50,087
Welcome to the yawning
abyss of oblivion.

1064
01:22:01,771 --> 01:22:02,640
Aaron.

1065
01:22:04,268 --> 01:22:07,321
You have to help him.
Please?

1066
01:22:08,893 --> 01:22:10,243
I want to.

1067
01:22:11,853 --> 01:22:13,961
I really do.
It's just that...

1068
01:22:14,979 --> 01:22:17,995
Ariel told me not to
until I know
it's the right thing.

1069
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:22,814
He wants to go back to Heaven
and you can do that for him.

1070
01:22:23,998 --> 01:22:25,737
How can you refuse?

1071
01:22:26,292 --> 01:22:28,882
Look in your heart.
You know it's right.

1072
01:22:34,255 --> 01:22:37,029
Wait a second.
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

1073
01:22:38,644 --> 01:22:41,530
With that amount of energy,
you're just going to call
the Powers right to us.

1074
01:22:41,752 --> 01:22:42,807
I know that.

1075
01:22:46,549 --> 01:22:48,751
But Vilma's right.
I can't just...

1076
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:50,786
let him die.

1077
01:22:51,859 --> 01:22:53,431
Aaron, don't.

1078
01:23:05,133 --> 01:23:06,262
You ready?

1079
01:23:09,462 --> 01:23:10,442
Yeah.

1080
01:23:45,284 --> 01:23:46,838
Stay with the traitor.

1081
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:48,022
Sachael.

1082
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,472
You.

1083
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,957
I need your help.

1084
01:24:18,916 --> 01:24:20,729
Fantastic!

1085
01:24:22,153 --> 01:24:24,855
You are a genius
of epic proportions,
my friend.

1086
01:24:25,599 --> 01:24:27,523
That was great. Yeah.
'Cause, uh...

1087
01:24:27,745 --> 01:24:29,058
we got away

1088
01:24:29,835 --> 01:24:31,574
and it was plain sailing
the whole time.

1089
01:24:31,685 --> 01:24:35,322
But now it's brilliant
because they know
exactly where we are.

1090
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,573
I'm really proud of you.
Well done.

1091
01:24:38,645 --> 01:24:39,941
Look, just shut up,
all right?

1092
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:42,068
Hey, I'm trying
to look out for you.

1093
01:24:43,015 --> 01:24:44,144
Trying to keep you alive.

1094
01:24:44,169 --> 01:24:46,833
The rest of the Fallen
will be plenty pissed with me

1095
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:48,504
if you died on my watch.

1096
01:24:49,817 --> 01:24:50,965
I'm just saying...

1097
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:53,869
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.

1098
01:24:54,795 --> 01:24:55,294
You?

1099
01:24:57,126 --> 01:24:58,606
I'm not afraid of anything.

1100
01:25:00,715 --> 01:25:01,732
Well, that's good.

1101
01:25:04,197 --> 01:25:05,548
Because here they come.

1102
01:25:10,769 --> 01:25:12,415
I'm gonna put
an end to this.

1103
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,103
I'm not running
from them anymore.

1104
01:25:18,249 --> 01:25:26,249

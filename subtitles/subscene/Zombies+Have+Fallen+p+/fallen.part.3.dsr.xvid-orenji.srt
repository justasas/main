1
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,284
<i>Previously on</i> Fallen...

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,409
Show us your wings,
your beautiful wings.

3
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:20,274
I'm taking her out of here.

4
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,276
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

5
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:29,616
I'm not even sure if
I'm doing the right thing.

6
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:33,571
How can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

7
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:36,859
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

8
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,292
The prophecy is real.

9
00:00:39,412 --> 00:00:42,953
As the prophecy has foretold,
a Nephilim has been born

10
00:00:42,954 --> 00:00:46,114
with the power to return
fallen angels to Heaven.

11
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:49,801
I need you to help him
fulfill his destiny.

12
00:00:56,462 --> 00:00:58,457
Who are you?
I'm Azazel.

13
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:00,491
Where is the Nephilim?

14
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,117
Camael's dead.

15
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,863
Why don't we get
out of town?

16
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,441
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

17
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:15,014
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

18
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:18,045
What is the Light Bringer?
Not what. Who.

19
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:21,779
Remember that prophecy about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

20
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:22,532
He wrote it.

21
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,798
- He's the Redeemer!
- What?

22
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,565
Do it. I don't want to
live without her anyway.

23
00:01:32,057 --> 00:01:36,763
When God created Man, a jealous Lucifer
mounted a great rebellion|in Heaven.

24
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:40,911
His army of angels was defeated,
and forever banished from Paradise.

25
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,635
These angels, the Fallen,
abandoned Lucifer,

26
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:47,526
choosing to live on Earth
among the pleasures of humans.

27
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:50,996
They took mortal wives,
and fathered abominations...

28
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:52,791
children called Nephilim.

29
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,842
They have the powers|of angels,
but the souls of men.

30
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,479
Angry, the Creator flooded the Earth,

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,300
killing the Nephilim and
driving the Fallen into hiding.

32
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,365
He sent the Powers, fierce warrior angels,
to hunt those that survived the Flood.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,353
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy:

34
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:14,583
A Nephilim would be born,
who would redeem them

35
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,688
So the fallen watched...

36
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,381
and waited.

37
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,542
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.You?

38
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,967
I'm not afraid
of anything.

39
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:34,670
I'm going to put
an end to this.
I'm not running
from them anymore.

40
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:49,368
Nephilim...
you face warriors of Heaven.

41
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:54,034
We fought in the greatest war
in the history of creation...
and won.

42
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,342
Do you really think
you stand a chance against us?

43
00:03:04,737 --> 00:03:05,814
Hello, Mazarin.

44
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:10,480
So, who wants
to die first?

45
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:14,245
This can't be.

46
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:18,351
That's exactly what Nathaniel said, moments
before I was dusting him off my boots.

47
00:03:19,268 --> 00:03:24,951
Your, uh, scar's healing up.
Looks good... ish.

48
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:28,239
It is our mission to cleanse
the Earth of your kind,

49
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,686
and those that spawned you.
We will not abandon it.

50
00:03:32,763 --> 00:03:36,532
We don't have to fight.
Just turn around and leave.

51
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:43,172
- If you do that, no one has to die.
- Oh, come on. Someone always has to die.

52
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:45,360
That's part of the fun.

53
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:37,318
Kill him.

54
00:04:40,223 --> 00:04:41,040
Kill him!

55
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,036
I yield.

56
00:04:57,152 --> 00:04:58,608
Duly noted.

57
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,214
What the hell
did you just do?

58
00:05:03,892 --> 00:05:05,813
- He yielded.
- And?

59
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:08,957
There's a line that
I'm not going to cross.

60
00:05:10,313 --> 00:05:13,522
And as long as you're with me,
you're not going to cross it either.

61
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,987
I'm not with you.
You're with me.

62
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:25,263
Listen to me. This Light Bringer,
he better be everything that you promised,

63
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:29,345
because I am running out of reasons
to hang around you.

64
00:05:30,223 --> 00:05:32,895
Let go of me.
Come on.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,033
The Light Bringer knows
everything about you, Aaron.

66
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:50,617
Who you are, where you came from.
You can learn it all.

67
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:55,781
We just have to get to him first
and I'm just trying to do

68
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,889
everything I can
to make sure you do.

69
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>You're free now.
Hurry, someone's coming.</i>

70
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:26,179
Still out, Camael?

71
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:50,224
How did I make fire come
out of me like that?

72
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:55,428
- It just happened. I wasn't even trying.
- You don't need to, sweet cheeks.

73
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:56,747
It's instinct.

74
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:58,823
You don't have to be taught
how to use your powers.

75
00:06:58,824 --> 00:07:00,783
The angel side of you already knows.

76
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,528
But your feeble, little human mind
gets in the way.

77
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,858
You just got to let go, let
the angel side take over.

78
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,863
You can't just let it take over.

79
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,760
That's like freeing a wild animal
that has no sense of..

80
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,369
good or evil, right or wrong.

81
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:21,075
You are so dramatic.
Well what about you, huh?

82
00:07:21,913 --> 00:07:23,659
You just do whatever you feel like?

83
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:26,129
You don't care about
what you say who you hurt?

84
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,789
It's just how the good Lord made me.
I'm being true to my nature.

85
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,616
You should try it sometime.

86
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:39,615
What is that noise?

87
00:07:42,566 --> 00:07:43,643
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

88
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,400
I think the car is about done.
What'd you do to it?

89
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:52,710
Human-made
piece of crap!

90
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,716
Well, never mind, we're going
to have to foot now, anyway.

91
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,664
Where are we going?
Yeah, see those mountains over there?

92
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:05,178
That is where we're going
to find the Light Bringer.

93
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:31,010
This is turning out
to be a really bad day.

94
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:37,869
Leave me.
I need to speak to the Creator.

95
00:08:54,034 --> 00:09:00,893
Nothing in the year since I've taken over
the Powers is what I've accomplished.

96
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:06,134
Under my command,
we've remained faithful.

97
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:09,862
We've continued and will continue
to pursue the abominations,

98
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:12,196
until they stain your planet no longer.

99
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:16,075
Is that what you perceive
your mission to be, Mazarin?

100
00:09:16,113 --> 00:09:17,099
Michael.

101
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:21,383
Camael?

102
00:09:23,636 --> 00:09:26,548
Oh, God. What have they done to you?

103
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,584
- Hold still, Camael.
- No.

104
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,251
Yes, you have to take
the healing, you have to.

105
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,596
- What?
- Aaron...

106
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:45,641
We must find Aaron.

107
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,193
What?

108
00:09:51,553 --> 00:09:53,892
It would be a whole lot easier
if we could just fly there.

109
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:55,423
But I don't have any wings, genius.

110
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:59,800
I don't know how to fly.
Hey, guys, can I help you with anything?

111
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:03,823
You bet you can.

112
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:07,674
We wanted to see if we
could get some camping gear.

113
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,871
You headed up to the mountains?

114
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:12,566
You seem like an outdoorsy kind of a gal.

115
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:16,331
Do you ever play
any... indoor sports?

116
00:10:17,188 --> 00:10:20,279
Sorry, he doesn't
get out much.

117
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:24,607
You might need something
warmer than that. Come on.

118
00:10:28,813 --> 00:10:32,318
Listen, I don't how we're going to pay
for this stuff. I'm running out of cash.

119
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:36,266
- Where did you get that?
- Remember that waitress from the diner?

120
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,516
Yeah.

121
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,220
Remember that line
you told me not to cross?

122
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,225
- Yeah.
- I crossed it.

123
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,336
But, in my defense, it was
before you told me not to.

124
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:55,170
Is that your boyfriend? Not the guy with
the French fries, the other one.

125
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:56,483
Why?

126
00:10:57,732 --> 00:10:59,788
No reason. He's cute.

127
00:11:02,455 --> 00:11:04,125
Yeah. I know.

128
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,666
So, is he your boyfriend or not?

129
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,053
I'm not sure.

130
00:11:16,664 --> 00:11:19,253
Lesbian.
Had to be.

131
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:24,929
Will you get over it?
Everybody gets rejected sometimes.

132
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:28,267
Not me. Nobody rejects me, ever.

133
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:32,368
Well, I know you think you're
God's gift to women, but,

134
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,124
I just don't see it. Sorry.

135
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,708
Oh, you don't, do you?

136
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:45,638
If I turned it on, sweetheart, you
wouldn't know what to do with yourself.

137
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,863
The only reason I haven't is because
the Redeemer's sweet on you.

138
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:54,636
- Ignore him.
- You can't ignore me. It's impossible.

139
00:12:03,896 --> 00:12:07,302
They lose a little something when
they get cold, don't they?

140
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:09,491
<i>Hey guys, come on, let's go.</i>

141
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:24,663
How much further?

142
00:12:25,264 --> 00:12:27,790
We won't get there
till tomorrow morning.

143
00:12:28,175 --> 00:12:29,133
Ariel...

144
00:12:31,152 --> 00:12:32,297
I'm dying.

145
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,495
- Don't say that. I can...
- You can give me

146
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,669
a little more time.

147
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,578
More strength.
That is all.

148
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:49,919
Perhaps this is what I deserve.
I clipped many an angel's wings

149
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,848
when I led the Powers.
I clipped yours.

150
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:58,793
At least you didn't use angelfire.
Not on you, Ariel.

151
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,473
Sorry, I haven't seen her.
Are you sure?

152
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:56,054
Take another look, she's probably
traveling with a boy around her age.

153
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,427
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

154
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:01,145
Look, if she was in here,
I don't remember her, all right?

155
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:04,591
Sorry I couldn't have been more help.

156
00:14:20,329 --> 00:14:25,484
Hey, Scott, it's Deborah. Would you mind
coming by the store for a little while?

157
00:14:26,716 --> 00:14:28,228
There's this guy...

158
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:35,805
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you nicely.

159
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,786
When was the girl here
and where did she go?

160
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,174
Lord Michael,
mightiest of angels,

161
00:14:48,772 --> 00:14:50,666
he who cast the rebels from Heaven.

162
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:56,030
That'll be enough of that, Mazarin.
On your feet. Let's speak as equals.

163
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:01,295
The Powers need guidance, Michael.

164
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,159
Aren't you meant to guide them?
Isn't that your charge?

165
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,632
I'm not sure I'm worthy.

166
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:09,954
The Powers were instrumental
in squashing Lucifer's rebellion.

167
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:15,109
You and your clan killed more rebels
than the rest of the clans combined.

168
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:20,931
That was not a compliment.
The rebellion tested us all.

169
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:24,331
For the first time,
we were given free will,

170
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:28,887
the ability to chose not only who
we fought for, but how we fought.

171
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,280
Do you understand what I'm saying?

172
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,786
I'm trying to tell you that the Powers
earned an exile as well.

173
00:15:38,115 --> 00:15:40,199
Not so different from the Fallen.

174
00:15:41,486 --> 00:15:44,447
Exile?
But...

175
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,673
But we remained faithful.

176
00:15:46,964 --> 00:15:49,236
Which is why you were
given a noble mission...

177
00:15:50,551 --> 00:15:53,677
to protect Earth against
threats to the Divine Plan.

178
00:15:54,243 --> 00:15:55,621
And are we wrong?

179
00:15:57,394 --> 00:15:59,968
Are we not meant
to destroy the Nephilim?

180
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:04,233
Is this boy really
who Camael says he is?

181
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,684
That's for you to decide.

182
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:12,158
There's at least one threat to the
planet of which you are certain.

183
00:16:13,576 --> 00:16:14,665
Azazel.

184
00:16:17,684 --> 00:16:18,659
To defeat him...

185
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:24,586
you may very well need the help of the
boy you've been trying so hard to kill.

186
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,700
<i>You know, Azazel,
you're not doing that right.</i>

187
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,291
Yes, I know I'm not
doing it right, Gabe.

188
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,061
<i>You sure that doesn't go over there?</i>

189
00:16:37,136 --> 00:16:39,615
Gabe, I've just realized what
I'm supposed to do with this,

190
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:41,418
and you're not going
to like it.

191
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,124
Can't we just play
with these sticks instead?

192
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:48,255
Why am I doing this?
I don't even sleep.

193
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:52,836
<i>You're no fun.</i>

194
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:36,950
Try it.

195
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:39,631
- I don't know how.
- You did it earlier.

196
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,014
Look, the angel inside of you
already knows how to do it.

197
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,779
The trick is to tap into that
knowledge without letting it take over.

198
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,188
- Go on, give it a shot.
- No.

199
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:54,307
Come on, just try it.

200
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:57,253
Picture it in your mind, okay?

201
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:07,779
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Hey...

202
00:18:10,633 --> 00:18:11,666
Focus.

203
00:18:13,703 --> 00:18:14,736
Okay.

204
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:22,921
Okay, great. Now just picture the flame

205
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,191
jumping from your hand into the fire.

206
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:28,934
All it takes is just a little nudge.

207
00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:40,781
- I did it.
- Told you.

208
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,208
So you really don't
want to be redeemed?

209
00:18:58,193 --> 00:18:59,198
Ever?

210
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:02,109
Heaven's just not for me. That's all.

211
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,823
It's not all sitting around on clouds,
playing harps and all that crap, you know?

212
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:13,434
So how much further to this Day Lighter,
or whatever you call him?

213
00:19:13,556 --> 00:19:14,730
Light Bringer.

214
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:19,209
I don't know how much
further, sweetheart.

215
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,563
I didn't get the most
precise directions.

216
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,503
- So you don't even know where we're going.
- We're in the right general area.

217
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:29,794
And from what I understand, it's damn
near impossible to miss the place.

218
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,325
Why were you imprisoned?

219
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:38,112
None of the other Fallen
were, right? Just you.

220
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:42,263
I'm not just any other
Fallen, sweetheart.

221
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,122
- I used to lead them.
- You led them?

222
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:50,685
Almost straight to Hell. It was my idea
to come to Earth, you know?

223
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,816
We made a decent team,

224
00:19:56,764 --> 00:20:00,323
Lucifer and me, but it was a
temporary alliance from the start.

225
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,559
I never wanted to take over
Heaven like he did.

226
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,194
I was fighting for the right to leave it.

227
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:14,486
- Where are you going?
- To take a leak.

228
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,307
To take a leak?

229
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:21,436
- I thought angels didn't take leaks.
- I'll figure something out.

230
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,917
Aaron, are you sure we can trust him?

231
00:20:31,386 --> 00:20:33,594
Azazel? Yeah.

232
00:20:36,212 --> 00:20:41,670
- I mean, he saved our lives twice.
- Yeah, but...

233
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,384
Yeah.

234
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:49,441
But it doesn't seem like
he's fighting to protect us,

235
00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:53,209
as much as he just likes to fight.

236
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,688
Well, at least
he's on our side.

237
00:21:00,428 --> 00:21:01,883
You sure about that?

238
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,611
Yeah.

239
00:21:06,925 --> 00:21:11,925
I just hope you're not looking for answers
so hard, you can't see anything else.

240
00:21:31,737 --> 00:21:33,757
<i>waffles, whipped cream, syrup.</i>

241
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:38,203
- He's dreaming.
- Yeah, I know.

242
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,598
Sounds like his dreams
are a lot better than mine.

243
00:21:47,537 --> 00:21:50,390
What are they like,
your dreams?

244
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:52,512
It's the same one...

245
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:56,719
over and over again.

246
00:21:57,554 --> 00:22:01,074
I'm fighting some kind of war,

247
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,281
except I don't even know...

248
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:08,168
whose side I'm on.

249
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:13,077
I'm just kind
of walking around,

250
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:17,376
and cutting down everyone
in front of me.

251
00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:22,904
It's like I'm some kind
of monster or something.

252
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,101
You're not a monster.

253
00:22:32,691 --> 00:22:35,950
- It's just a dream.
- What if it's not a dream?

254
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:41,414
What if that's the real me?

255
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:47,201
That's all of this,
that's the dream.

256
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:52,947
Funny, I've been afraid that
I'm the one who's dreaming.

257
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:59,326
Like, I'm going to wake up any minute
and find myself back in Lukas' attic.

258
00:23:01,879 --> 00:23:02,875
You know,

259
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:07,457
I thought about you all the time.

260
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:14,477
I still can't even
believe that you're here

261
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,754
Right next to me.

262
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,166
I'm sorry.

263
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,462
No, you're beautiful.

264
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:08,169
Vanity is a sin,
Azazel.

265
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:13,885
If the Creator hadn't wanted
me to admire myself,

266
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:16,674
he wouldn't have made me so pretty.

267
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:24,322
- How are we  progressing?
- You'll have him tomorrow.

268
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:28,520
Good. I knew if anyone could
come through for me, it would be you.

269
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,609
I'm the only one who would
and the only one who could.

270
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:34,623
Which brings us to your
part of the bargain.

271
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,996
When this is over, I want my freedom.

272
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:46,183
- I'm never going back  to that pit again.
- I see.

273
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,141
You're concerned that I'm going to
renege on my agreement

274
00:24:50,743 --> 00:24:52,537
and imprison you again.

275
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,572
You should learn to be
more trusting, Azazel.

276
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,367
- It's good for the soul.
- Too bad I don't have one.

277
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:04,586
<i>Azazel, is that you?</i>

278
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:50,292
Gabe, come on, wake up, boy.

279
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,692
- Oh, thank God I found you.
- Found me?

280
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,795
I'm lost, I walked off the trail two
days ago. I have no idea where I am.

281
00:26:05,214 --> 00:26:08,316
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am now.

282
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:13,410
Hey, look, I haven't eaten in a
long time, you got any extra food?

283
00:26:13,703 --> 00:26:15,052
Yeah, we have plenty of food.

284
00:26:16,263 --> 00:26:19,723
Thanks. I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

285
00:26:37,652 --> 00:26:42,062
Nephilim may have the powers of angels,
but your biology is mostly human,

286
00:26:42,872 --> 00:26:44,467
unfortunately for you.

287
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:54,578
Ariel, this is the sight [SITE?]
of Anane's redemption.

288
00:27:10,804 --> 00:27:13,631
- I was wondering when you'd show up.
- Azazel is free.

289
00:27:13,971 --> 00:27:15,895
And he's with your Nephilim.

290
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,537
You're not taking me back there.

291
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,094
Grasic's dead. It's the Redeemer I want.

292
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:56,767
Naughty.

293
00:28:44,428 --> 00:28:45,680
You're okay.

294
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:53,504
- Who is that guy?
- That's the man who kidnapped me.

295
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,812
Look at all this stuff.

296
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:01,395
These are pretty cool.

297
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:04,269
You know, if I hadn't have come galloping
to your rescue, both your heads

298
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:06,674
would be mounted on a
wall somewhere by now.

299
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:08,703
No.

300
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:15,002
He said he wanted Aaron alive.
He knows that you're the Redeemer.

301
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,455
Wake up.

302
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:27,924
Who are you?

303
00:29:29,414 --> 00:29:32,109
You with the Order, huh?
Answer me!

304
00:29:34,877 --> 00:29:36,062
Aaron, stop it!

305
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,133
What do you people want from me?
What do you think we want?

306
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:42,776
We want redemption.

307
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,339
Did you really think your powers
can only be used on the Fallen?

308
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:53,233
His power wasn't meant for you.
It was meant for us.

309
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:57,165
That's not true. You can send
anyone you want to Heaven,

310
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,487
whether they deserve it or not.

311
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:00,748
Yeah.

312
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,361
Yeah, whether they worship
graven images or not,

313
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:10,773
whether they covet their neighbor's
wife, if they repent or not.

314
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:14,715
I would never use my powers like that.

315
00:30:26,582 --> 00:30:29,444
The stench of death
is all over you, my friend.

316
00:30:30,711 --> 00:30:32,869
You don't have
long left, do you?

317
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,778
I have a brain tumor,

318
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:39,002
that's why I need you.

319
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,776
I've done a lot of bad things in my life,

320
00:30:45,454 --> 00:30:48,974
things that can never be forgiven,
but you can pardon me,

321
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,197
you can keep me from going to Hell.
You can wash me clean of my sins.

322
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:01,677
Please, please.

323
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,163
Sorry.

324
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:07,612
- I can't do that.
- No.

325
00:31:10,846 --> 00:31:14,353
No. You're going to have
to pay for what you've done.

326
00:31:29,584 --> 00:31:31,321
You just killed him.

327
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:38,617
- Why would you do that?
- He was dying anyway.

328
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,335
He kidnapped your girlfriend, sold her,

329
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:53,828
he was trying to use you to get a
bunch of sinners into Heaven.

330
00:31:55,928 --> 00:31:57,054
Leave him.

331
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,150
He's nothing to us.

332
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:05,520
Aaron...

333
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:12,570
- this is wrong.
- I know.

334
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,717
I don't know why Azazel is free,

335
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:23,318
or what he's doing
with the Redeemer.

336
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,927
I served under Azazel.

337
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:31,925
Locking him up was the only
good thing you Powers ever did.

338
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:37,167
Mazarin, take to the sky. Scout ahead.
Look for any traces of angel activity.

339
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:38,985
Sachael, come with us.

340
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,402
We don't take orders
from you anymore, Camael.

341
00:32:41,484 --> 00:32:45,277
You will. That is the only way
we're going to do this.

342
00:32:49,739 --> 00:32:54,142
Is it always going to be like this?
I don't know if I can do this, Aaron,

343
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,022
all this running
and fighting and killing.

344
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:03,101
I don't like it either.

345
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:07,112
Part of you must.

346
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:11,379
I've seen it... when you fight.

347
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:15,989
Sometimes it looks
like you're enjoying it.

348
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,562
Just like Azazel.

349
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,155
I'm nothing like Azazel.

350
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:37,067
Why are we doing this anyway? What is it
you want to learn from this Light Bringer?

351
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:43,435
Maybe he can tell me

352
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:46,997
more about where I come from.

353
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,434
Why I have all these visions and

354
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:53,343
all these dreams, and why I have all
this anger inside of me,

355
00:33:53,355 --> 00:33:55,279
and just what it means to be the Redeemer.

356
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,585
Maybe he can tell me who I am.

357
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,609
Aaron, no one can
tell you that.

358
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,247
You need to decide
for yourself who you are.

359
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,626
Then you should try to ve up to that.

360
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:38,950
- There it is.
- This is it?

361
00:34:39,459 --> 00:34:41,676
Yeah, that's where |you're going.

362
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,579
- You sure this is the place?
- Have I ever lied to you?

363
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:41,033
- This isn't for you.
- Why can't you come?

364
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:44,130
This isn't about us, Aaron.

365
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,610
Aaron, this doesn't feel right.

366
00:35:49,487 --> 00:35:50,754
Don't go in there.

367
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:53,768
I have to.

368
00:37:35,407 --> 00:37:36,522
Hello?

369
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,258
Anybody here?

370
00:38:36,334 --> 00:38:38,270
You'll have to forgive me.

371
00:38:42,493 --> 00:38:44,675
I wasn't expecting
you so soon.

372
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:51,041
I've waited a long
time to meet you.

373
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:56,273
- Are you the Light Bringer?
- I am.

374
00:38:57,809 --> 00:39:03,146
- And you're Aaron Corbett, the Redeemer.
- How do you know|my name?

375
00:39:03,756 --> 00:39:08,883
This meeting, like your birth,
was foretold to me long ago.

376
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:10,983
So it is true.

377
00:39:14,303 --> 00:39:16,238
You did write
the prophecy about me.

378
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:18,698
Yes.

379
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,346
You've come here
looking for answers,

380
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:27,777
to learn where you come from, so that you
can better understand where you're going.

381
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:31,000
I have so much
to tell you, Aaron.

382
00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:37,428
I can help you learn the truth,
if you're strong enough to face it.

383
00:39:40,152 --> 00:39:41,137
Are you?

384
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,621
Yes...

385
00:39:47,342 --> 00:39:48,316
I am.

386
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,263
How are you doing
back there?

387
00:40:01,709 --> 00:40:04,724
I would not have had
your wings removed, Camael.

388
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,546
That was Mazarin's
doing, not mine.

389
00:40:08,895 --> 00:40:10,369
I remember, Sachael.

390
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:14,463
He's a good soldier,
you know that,

391
00:40:16,012 --> 00:40:18,264
but your desertion broke his heart.

392
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:33,580
Might want to get comfortable, love.
This might take a while.

393
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,388
What is this place?

394
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,781
It's a monastery,
or rather, it was.

395
00:40:56,948 --> 00:40:59,036
It hasn't been
used in decades.

396
00:40:59,811 --> 00:41:04,261
In fact, you're the first living soul
I've seen here in years.

397
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:12,320
People don't often
find their way here.

398
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,354
Not unless they're
seeking me out.

399
00:41:20,556 --> 00:41:24,169
Now you must be very tired.
Maybe you'd like to sit down?

400
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:55,682
So do you really
know everything about me?

401
00:41:58,613 --> 00:41:59,833
Hardly.

402
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:05,769
But I am very curious to hear
what you know about yourself,

403
00:42:05,851 --> 00:42:08,006
or what you believe you know.

404
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,276
Well, I know that
my father is an angel.

405
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:16,452
And my mother is dead.

406
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:24,194
Does that disturb you, knowing that
your father allowed your mother to die?

407
00:42:27,375 --> 00:42:29,240
He didn't allow|her to die.

408
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:33,228
He killed her.

409
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:40,159
Is that how you view your conception?
As murder?

410
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:44,633
Isn't that what it is?

411
00:42:45,572 --> 00:42:48,403
The Fallen know that a human
can't survive a Nephilim's birth.

412
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:52,986
Our mothers die
the second we're born,

413
00:42:54,828 --> 00:42:59,215
and we're left alone, to spend the rest
of our lives running from the Powers.

414
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,723
It's selfish
and it's cruel,

415
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:06,300
and the truth is,

416
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,142
I don't know if any of the Fallen
are truly worthy of redemption.

417
00:43:27,525 --> 00:43:28,945
We should have
left him behind.

418
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:32,452
He's a liability.

419
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,200
The Nephilim won't trust us without
Ariel and Camael. We need them.

420
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,937
I don't blame you for being angry,

421
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:52,400
but the way you look
at your mother's death,

422
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,036
it does her a great disservice.

423
00:43:57,174 --> 00:43:58,641
What do you mean?

424
00:43:59,872 --> 00:44:05,483
You paint her as a... a victim instead
of the martyr she truly was.

425
00:44:06,937 --> 00:44:09,037
I loved her very much.

426
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:12,626
You... You loved her?

427
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:15,533
Yes, Aaron.

428
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:18,348
I'm your father.

429
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,217
I know how
you must be feeling.

430
00:44:47,607 --> 00:44:49,710
There were times when
I really need a father.

431
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:51,851
Where were you?

432
00:44:52,868 --> 00:44:55,392
I was here,
waiting for you.

433
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:58,327
I couldn't have
raised you, Aaron.

434
00:44:59,454 --> 00:45:03,668
For your own protection you need to
remain hidden until you came of age.

435
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:08,100
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
You have no idea how sorry.

436
00:45:09,025 --> 00:45:12,612
I just hope that you can
find it in your heart to forgive me.

437
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:14,239
To forgive you?

438
00:45:15,794 --> 00:45:17,968
I can feel it when a Fallen

439
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,630
wants redemption,

440
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:24,327
and I have never
felt it as strongly

441
00:45:25,494 --> 00:45:26,713
as I do right now.

442
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:29,655
Is that what you want?

443
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,735
From me to send you
back to Heaven?

444
00:45:34,237 --> 00:45:35,852
You are the Redeemer.

445
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,304
And when the time is right,
when you

446
00:45:40,313 --> 00:45:43,862
are absolutely certain that I have
atoned for my sins,

447
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:48,072
yes, perhaps you will
return me to Paradise.

448
00:45:49,062 --> 00:45:53,058
And that is when you will have
fulfilled your destiny.

449
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,935
So that's what
all of this is about?

450
00:45:58,123 --> 00:46:00,294
That's why I have
all this power?

451
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:03,947
Just so I can redeem you?

452
00:46:04,548 --> 00:46:07,205
All the Fallen must return
to Heaven, Aaron.

453
00:46:07,252 --> 00:46:08,792
That's the prophecy.

454
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:12,639
But if I don't return
to Heaven myself, then...

455
00:46:14,113 --> 00:46:16,766
then it was... all for nothing.

456
00:46:35,138 --> 00:46:38,234
From the moment I took up arms
against the Creator

457
00:46:39,182 --> 00:46:42,769
to the day that I had my vision that
foretold your coming...

458
00:46:46,112 --> 00:46:47,693
Oh, I denied it at first,

459
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:50,988
but after I thought about it,
it made perfect sense...

460
00:46:52,491 --> 00:46:53,909
that this Redeemer

461
00:46:54,387 --> 00:46:57,665
would come from a Fallen
that needed forgiveness most.

462
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,178
The one who started it all.

463
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:04,821
Who are you?

464
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:07,084
Who am I?

465
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:12,548
I am nothing but what you see
before you, Aaron.

466
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:15,281
A fallen angel,

467
00:47:16,474 --> 00:47:18,145
the Bringer of Light...

468
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:21,995
Your father.

469
00:47:24,051 --> 00:47:25,826
I want to know your name.

470
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,068
I have so many names.

471
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:32,323
More than I can even
remember myself.

472
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:36,624
But the one
the Creator gave me...

473
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:40,943
is Lucifer.

474
00:47:43,825 --> 00:47:44,802
No.

475
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,447
Yes, Aaron.

476
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:50,605
I am Lucifer Morningstar, first of
the Fallen, and you are my son.

477
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:55,320
I don't believe you.

478
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:56,456
Yes, you do.

479
00:47:57,842 --> 00:48:00,209
You know it's true.
You can feel it.

480
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,209
- My blood has been crying out to you.
- Get away from me!

481
00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:06,087
Stay away!

482
00:48:14,376 --> 00:48:15,494
Aaron.

483
00:48:21,927 --> 00:48:23,486
Don't come any closer.

484
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,605
I am not the son
of the Devil.

485
00:48:27,234 --> 00:48:29,785
And I am not what
you believe me to be.

486
00:48:31,093 --> 00:48:33,506
Please, let me
make you understand.

487
00:48:33,731 --> 00:48:35,027
I do understand.

488
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:40,458
I finally understand what all of these
dreams have been trying to tell me.

489
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:43,022
Dreams?

490
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:45,623
I see myself as evil.

491
00:48:46,476 --> 00:48:48,309
I see myself as a monster,

492
00:48:49,189 --> 00:48:50,175
like you.

493
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:53,790
Whatever you think I am,

494
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:57,628
please give me the chance
to convince you otherwise.

495
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,056
Or strike me down now.

496
00:48:59,208 --> 00:49:01,008
I shall make no move
to stop you.

497
00:49:02,654 --> 00:49:04,936
My fate is entirely
in your hands.

498
00:49:21,977 --> 00:49:24,559
I knew you would make
the right decision.

499
00:49:27,508 --> 00:49:28,700
You always do.

500
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:27,113
Ariel.

501
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:29,889
Azazel did this.

502
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:31,977
I can smell him.

503
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,495
Azazel is a force
of nature.

504
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:40,119
He will never change.

505
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:42,254
But realigning with Lucifer?

506
00:50:44,038 --> 00:50:45,704
After all it's cost us?

507
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,597
Lucifer?

508
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:50,284
Lucifer is involved
in this?

509
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:53,401
He wants the Redeemer.

510
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:57,176
He used Azazel to get him.

511
00:51:12,943 --> 00:51:15,741
Can Lucifer use this boy
to return to Heaven?

512
00:51:18,783 --> 00:51:22,316
Why do you think I've been trying
so very hard to protect him?

513
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:25,284
I've been trying to prevent
this very thing from happening.

514
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:28,617
Azazel got to Aaron
because of you.

515
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:33,673
He's in Lucifer's hands now
because of you.

516
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:36,411
The world as we know it

517
00:51:36,922 --> 00:51:38,605
may be about to end...

518
00:51:41,457 --> 00:51:42,747
because of you.

519
00:52:05,337 --> 00:52:07,638
Do you know why
I rebelled, Aaron?

520
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:12,032
It's because you wanted
to take over Heaven,

521
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,126
steal it from the Creator.

522
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:18,675
As they say, history is written
by the winners.

523
00:52:20,194 --> 00:52:21,960
You know, the truth is...

524
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:25,493
I only wanted the freedom
to choose my own destiny.

525
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:29,584
But it is not better to reign in Hell
than it is to serve in Heaven.

526
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,307
I didn't construct Hell

527
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:37,201
to be a haven
for the Creator's rejects.

528
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,431
But when more of them started to come
to me instead of Heaven...

529
00:52:41,604 --> 00:52:45,320
You assumed the Creator gave up on them.

530
00:52:46,223 --> 00:52:47,221
Yes.

531
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,536
Humans love to disobey.

532
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:55,775
None of it's true, then?

533
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,095
All of the horrible things you're
supposed to be responsible for?

534
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:01,663
They're all lies?

535
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:04,377
No.

536
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:09,466
No, I'm not saying
I'm perfect.

537
00:53:11,003 --> 00:53:14,172
But your arrival tells me
that I have atoned.

538
00:53:14,712 --> 00:53:17,162
More than that,
I know it in my heart.

539
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,772
When all the angels
have reunited in Heaven,

540
00:53:21,317 --> 00:53:26,349
then we can restore the Earth to the
reflection of Paradise it was meant to be.

541
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:31,925
You could bring us all
back together.

542
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:38,901
And what if I don't?

543
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,351
Well, you've seen the signs...

544
00:53:45,738 --> 00:53:50,264
war, famine, pestilence, death.
It's all around us.

545
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,832
These are the End Times, Aaron.

546
00:53:56,549 --> 00:53:58,586
The Day of Judgment is coming.

547
00:54:01,178 --> 00:54:02,977
And only you can stop it.

548
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:18,040
How long is he going
to be in there for?

549
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:20,848
As long as it takes.

550
00:54:21,665 --> 00:54:23,080
As long as what takes?

551
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:24,986
For him to accept the truth.

552
00:54:25,935 --> 00:54:27,904
What truth?
Is he going to be all right?

553
00:54:29,343 --> 00:54:30,639
The truth hurts.

554
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:33,601
Sometimes it hurts more than others.

555
00:54:42,334 --> 00:54:43,493
I'm going in there.

556
00:54:43,508 --> 00:54:46,338
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, sweetheart.

557
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:50,234
No, of course you wouldn't.

558
00:54:50,828 --> 00:54:53,814
You wouldn't do anything
unless there's something in it for you.

559
00:54:53,852 --> 00:54:56,631
Is this Light Bringer
the one who freed you?

560
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,381
Is this why you brought
Aaron over here?

561
00:54:59,409 --> 00:55:02,593
You've got me all figured out,
don't you, sweetcheeks?

562
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:06,386
Yeah, I made a deal with him.

563
00:55:07,353 --> 00:55:09,557
And deals with him don't come cheap.

564
00:55:10,646 --> 00:55:12,496
What are you talking about?

565
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:16,555
You can speak every
conceivable language.

566
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,623
You don't even understand what you know.

567
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:22,943
What is "Light Bringer" in Latin?

568
00:55:29,565 --> 00:55:30,813
Lucifer.

569
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:32,944
Right.

570
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,024
Aaron put his faith in you.

571
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:38,897
He's a fool.

572
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,143
<i>I'm coming, too.</i>

573
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:12,102
<i>I can smell him, Vilma.</i>

574
00:56:32,543 --> 00:56:33,567
Hello?

575
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,902
Aaron?

576
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,248
<i>Aaron?</i>

577
00:57:04,434 --> 00:57:05,532
<i>Who's that?</i>

578
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:11,245
Lucifer.

579
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,011
So you're telling me that

580
00:57:57,025 --> 00:57:58,996
in order to save Earth

581
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:02,712
I have to send the Devil
back to Heaven?

582
00:58:05,939 --> 00:58:09,892
I told you, I haven't
been the Devil in ages.

583
00:58:18,017 --> 00:58:19,817
It was my vision of you

584
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,616
that inspired me to leave Hell

585
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,031
and serve my penance on Earth.

586
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:33,488
Just like any of the Fallen.

587
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:39,090
Just like the ones
you've already redeemed.

588
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:45,016
Their sin was the same as mine
and you found them worthy.

589
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:48,190
Aaron...

590
00:58:51,147 --> 00:58:53,833
we all deserve forgiveness

591
00:58:55,335 --> 00:58:56,800
if we truly want it.

592
00:58:57,019 --> 00:58:59,789
You can't deny what your body
is telling you.

593
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:09,866
Ok.

594
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:14,688
Ok?

595
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,167
I'll do it.

596
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:21,516
Oh, thank you, son.

597
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:23,832
Thank you.

598
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:31,900
Give me your hand.

599
01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:17,398
I saw you. I saw the things
you've done.

600
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,794
I saw what you really are.

601
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:22,802
No. No, you...
you saw me as I was.

602
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,572
I want to trust you.

603
01:00:27,084 --> 01:00:28,070
I do.

604
01:00:30,164 --> 01:00:31,290
But I can't.

605
01:00:34,707 --> 01:00:38,041
Please, Aaron.
I'm your father.

606
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:41,216
I came here...

607
01:00:42,538 --> 01:00:44,006
looking for answers.

608
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:47,320
Like you were just going to say some
magic words

609
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:50,419
and all of a sudden, my life would just
make sense.

610
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,820
But I don't care what the prophecy says.

611
01:00:55,554 --> 01:00:58,164
I don't care what anybody
tells me to do.

612
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,593
I know what feels right
and I know what doesn't.

613
01:01:05,101 --> 01:01:06,296
And this feels wrong.

614
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:12,435
I can't redeem you.

615
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,303
I won't.

616
01:01:25,672 --> 01:01:28,311
Il gran rifiuto.

617
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,418
I'm going home now.

618
01:01:38,597 --> 01:01:39,604
No, Aaron.

619
01:01:41,923 --> 01:01:43,688
You're not going anywhere.

620
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:57,402
Where are we?

621
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:14,316
No! No! No!

622
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,196
Just finished.

623
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,327
You're safe now.

624
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:22,194
This was my punishment...

625
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,734
an eternity without you.

626
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:28,603
But you came back to me,
thank God.

627
01:02:28,685 --> 01:02:30,291
No! No!

628
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,890
Lukas, you can't do this to me.

629
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:37,001
Maybe this is Heaven after all.

630
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:03,004
Where are we?

631
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:07,131
The monastery

632
01:03:07,948 --> 01:03:10,118
is where I broke through, Aaron.

633
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:13,941
My portal to Earth.

634
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:18,936
I'm not able to leave
its grounds, but...

635
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:22,641
I am allowed certain
comforts of home here.

636
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:26,641
To enter these walls

637
01:03:28,444 --> 01:03:30,288
is to enter Hell itself.

638
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:33,233
This is Hell?

639
01:03:36,275 --> 01:03:37,251
Yes.

640
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:41,651
This is my dominion.

641
01:03:43,655 --> 01:03:44,807
And you,

642
01:03:45,261 --> 01:03:46,991
like these poor souls,

643
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,428
are now a prisoner here.

644
01:03:52,193 --> 01:03:53,959
But I am offering you

645
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:58,825
something that the rest of my guests
would do anything to have.

646
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:01,661
A way out.

647
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:08,854
Send me home, son,

648
01:04:09,184 --> 01:04:10,649
to Paradise.

649
01:04:12,302 --> 01:04:13,964
So you can take over?

650
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:18,093
Is that what you want?

651
01:04:20,325 --> 01:04:21,395
 No.

652
01:04:22,315 --> 01:04:23,799
I won't let you.

653
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:28,596
And if I have to spend
an eternity in Hell

654
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:31,318
to make sure that you never get there,

655
01:04:33,478 --> 01:04:36,248
that's a sacrifice
that I'm willing to make.

656
01:04:40,194 --> 01:04:41,940
How noble of you.

657
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,275
But...

658
01:04:46,438 --> 01:04:48,682
what of the lovely
Ms. Rodriguez?

659
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:51,899
She entered the monastery
looking for you.

660
01:04:52,137 --> 01:04:53,846
But she found...

661
01:04:55,198 --> 01:04:56,560
something else.

662
01:04:57,377 --> 01:04:58,724
Where is she?

663
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:00,628
She's in my care.

664
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,980
And she will remain there

665
01:05:04,097 --> 01:05:07,083
until you do
what you were born to do.

666
01:05:08,370 --> 01:05:09,872
I don't believe you.

667
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:13,008
This is another one
of your lies.

668
01:05:16,651 --> 01:05:17,684
Is it?

669
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,537
Look down there.

670
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:31,988
I knew, Vilma.

671
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,627
Vilma!

672
01:05:33,628 --> 01:05:35,224
I always knew

673
01:05:36,192 --> 01:05:38,379
that we'd end up together.

674
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,990
It's not the Redeemer
you belong with.

675
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:48,431
It's me, Vilma.

676
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,460
There were times

677
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:54,943
when you were happy with me.

678
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:58,211
Do you rember?

679
01:05:59,601 --> 01:06:01,422
You'll be happy again.

680
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:07,003
She can't hear
or see you, Aaron.

681
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,954
Just look at her.

682
01:06:10,647 --> 01:06:13,686
An eternity as a prisoner
of that twisted old man.

683
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:16,754
It's one thing
to sacrifice yourself, Aaron.

684
01:06:17,477 --> 01:06:20,491
But are you willing to damn
the woman you love?

685
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,214
Wipe these runes away.

686
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:27,833
If I brush away
those markings,

687
01:06:28,538 --> 01:06:30,866
then I'll condemn myself

688
01:06:33,204 --> 01:06:35,311
to eternal torment.

689
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,212
If I don't...

690
01:06:43,517 --> 01:06:45,659
I'll condemn you.

691
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:08,725
Go.

692
01:07:09,214 --> 01:07:10,519
Thank you.

693
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:14,378
Just go.

694
01:07:21,924 --> 01:07:23,720
Well...

695
01:07:24,328 --> 01:07:27,008
the esteemed Dr. Grasic
just earned himself

696
01:07:27,135 --> 01:07:29,541
an upgrade in his damnation.

697
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,348
You couldn't
keep her here.

698
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:43,244
You can't keep anyone here.

699
01:07:44,512 --> 01:07:46,803
You don't have
that kind of power.

700
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:49,791
Hell is a choice that we make.

701
01:07:52,298 --> 01:07:54,955
The only real
prisoner here is you.

702
01:07:59,182 --> 01:08:00,750
You're so smart.

703
01:08:04,468 --> 01:08:06,074
I tried to be nice,

704
01:08:06,402 --> 01:08:08,594
I tried intimidation, and now

705
01:08:09,111 --> 01:08:11,064
I have to resort to force.

706
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:12,369
Then go ahead.

707
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:15,139
Kill me.

708
01:08:17,252 --> 01:08:18,519
I'm not afraid.

709
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,421
I didn't expect to see you again.

710
01:08:45,223 --> 01:08:47,345
Did you find
what you were looking for?

711
01:08:47,411 --> 01:08:49,429
You sent Aaron to his doom.

712
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:51,505
You knew!

713
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:53,824
He trusted you.

714
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:55,806
You can help him.

715
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:58,801
You have to, Azazel.
I know you can.

716
01:08:58,876 --> 01:09:00,069
Why would I?

717
01:09:00,876 --> 01:09:03,984
You know what it's like
to be held against your will.

718
01:09:04,519 --> 01:09:06,039
This is your chance

719
01:09:06,161 --> 01:09:09,091
to make up for everything
that you've done wrong.

720
01:09:09,636 --> 01:09:10,715
Take it.

721
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:13,231
Please, Azazel.|Please.

722
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:16,837
Do it!

723
01:09:18,715 --> 01:09:20,123
Do it or what?

724
01:09:21,335 --> 01:09:22,906
Or I'll kill you.

725
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:26,523
I was thinking about it!

726
01:09:27,516 --> 01:09:29,150
I was on the fence!

727
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:33,251
But then you had to go
and ask me so politely.

728
01:09:35,265 --> 01:09:37,462
I think I have
some time to kill.

729
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:43,488
You're right, Aaron,
I can't keep you here in Hell.

730
01:09:44,023 --> 01:09:47,845
But I can persuade you
to be reasonable.

731
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:52,202
And this time, don't expect Azazel
to come to your rescue.

732
01:09:52,775 --> 01:09:54,699
Azazel knew what you wanted.

733
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,493
He was in on this.

734
01:09:56,803 --> 01:09:58,366
Of course he was.

735
01:09:58,662 --> 01:09:59,742
So,

736
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:02,247
it comes down to this.

737
01:10:03,759 --> 01:10:05,543
If you stand against me,

738
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:08,392
you stand alone.

739
01:10:22,413 --> 01:10:25,191
I am the most powerful angel
that was ever created.

740
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,992
Do you really believe
that you can beat me?

741
01:10:41,731 --> 01:10:45,117
The angel in me is just as powerful
as you are.

742
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,637
But my humanity
makes me stronger.

743
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:50,275
Really?

744
01:10:50,407 --> 01:10:52,266
You've been defeated before.

745
01:10:52,398 --> 01:10:54,576
And once is enough.

746
01:11:19,183 --> 01:11:20,733
Not bad for a girl.

747
01:11:34,894 --> 01:11:37,204
You know, I hate
hurting pretty girls!

748
01:11:38,348 --> 01:11:41,634
But something about you
really pisses me off.

749
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:49,217
Run!

750
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,325
Camael.
I thought you were dead.

751
01:11:52,983 --> 01:11:54,534
Let's see if we can fix that.

752
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:56,234
This is where it ends.

753
01:12:14,903 --> 01:12:16,323
Azazel, no!

754
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:34,721
Azazel.

755
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:36,209
Mazarin!

756
01:12:38,838 --> 01:12:41,261
5,000 years ago,
I put you in chains.

757
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:43,608
Will you return willingly?

758
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:45,959
Never!

759
01:12:46,307 --> 01:12:48,955
Then you leave me no choice
but to fight you to the death.

760
01:12:48,974 --> 01:12:50,926
Now you're speaking
my language!

761
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:53,190
Let's do this!
Man to man!

762
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:45,897
You are my son!

763
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:49,448
You were born to help me
destroy the Creator,

764
01:13:49,699 --> 01:13:52,448
and by God you are going
to live up to that!

765
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,522
Surrender, my son.

766
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:04,164
The prophecy.

767
01:14:06,641 --> 01:14:08,583
I don't care
about the prophecy.

768
01:14:08,941 --> 01:14:10,641
I care about my destiny!

769
01:14:12,763 --> 01:14:14,235
This is my life!

770
01:14:14,638 --> 01:14:16,413
I'm taking control of it.

771
01:14:33,258 --> 01:14:34,732
I'm sorry, son.

772
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:37,724
I never meant for it
to end like this.

773
01:14:44,935 --> 01:14:46,927
Go ahead!
Say it!

774
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:53,632
Go to Hell!

775
01:15:12,249 --> 01:15:13,235
<i>Aaron!</i>

776
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:14,907
Gabe.

777
01:15:16,446 --> 01:15:18,078
<i>Let's get out of here.</i>

778
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:38,897
Go ahead.

779
01:15:40,164 --> 01:15:41,235
Kill me.

780
01:15:43,178 --> 01:15:44,634
Kill me!

781
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,927
Give me a warrior's death.

782
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,291
You know you want to.

783
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:53,833
No, Azazel.

784
01:15:54,668 --> 01:15:57,898
I follow the Creator's orders.
Not yours.

785
01:16:02,619 --> 01:16:03,623
Ariel.

786
01:16:12,213 --> 01:16:13,199
Ariel...

787
01:16:16,082 --> 01:16:17,697
Long time no see.

788
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:19,434
Don't do it.

789
01:16:22,251 --> 01:16:24,035
No, you're going back.

790
01:16:26,739 --> 01:16:28,955
Then how about
a kiss good-night?

791
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:49,058
I'm so glad
you're all right.

792
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:56,544
Camael!

793
01:17:01,595 --> 01:17:02,901
You're alive?

794
01:17:06,913 --> 01:17:08,434
What happened to you?

795
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:11,777
Did you...
Did you see him?

796
01:17:13,889 --> 01:17:14,885
Aaron...

797
01:17:16,422 --> 01:17:19,784
did you meet... Lucifer?

798
01:17:20,741 --> 01:17:22,572
I sent him back to Hell...

799
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,303
where he belongs.

800
01:17:32,678 --> 01:17:34,472
It's too late for me.

801
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:37,570
I'm not going
to let you die.

802
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:41,532
I'd never considered...

803
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:45,241
that your powers

804
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,954
would apply to me.

805
01:17:50,705 --> 01:17:53,625
I've taken
so many lives, Aaron.

806
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,968
I've killed so many.

807
01:18:00,229 --> 01:18:03,309
I... I have not earned

808
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:06,670
my redemption.

809
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:14,494
If anyone's earned
their redemption, Camael,

810
01:18:17,263 --> 01:18:18,353
it's you.

811
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,934
And I'm going
to send you home now.

812
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:37,845
Good-bye, Camael.

813
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:43,297
Good-bye...

814
01:18:46,114 --> 01:18:47,297
my friend.

815
01:18:49,682 --> 01:18:51,344
I'll be watching you...

816
01:18:53,016 --> 01:18:54,046
Nephilim.

817
01:19:47,068 --> 01:19:48,207
Forgive me.

818
01:19:48,864 --> 01:19:51,662
You are indeed the Redeemer
of the prophecy.

819
01:19:58,310 --> 01:19:59,544
It's over.

820
01:20:00,446 --> 01:20:01,751
All of it.

821
01:20:02,652 --> 01:20:04,962
You're going to stop
killing the Fallen,

822
01:20:05,451 --> 01:20:06,681
the Nephilim.

823
01:20:08,192 --> 01:20:10,169
Find yourself
a new mission.

824
01:20:28,072 --> 01:20:29,226
Noooo!

825
01:20:30,691 --> 01:20:31,740
No!

826
01:20:33,149 --> 01:20:36,792
Your sentence was to remain here
until Judgment Day, Azazel.

827
01:20:37,336 --> 01:20:39,862
But the Redeemer
has defeated Lucifer.

828
01:20:40,632 --> 01:20:42,608
So that day may never come.

829
01:20:48,233 --> 01:20:51,040
Well, I'm nothing
if not patient, Mazarin!

830
01:20:53,278 --> 01:20:55,982
We'll just have to wait
and see, won't we?

831
01:21:22,426 --> 01:21:24,012
So what happens now?

832
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,327
Well, Aaron,
that's really up to you.

833
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:36,753
There are still a lot of Fallen
who need redemption, right?

834
01:21:36,782 --> 01:21:39,908
Yes, but everything's different now.
They can come out of hiding.

835
01:21:39,983 --> 01:21:43,721
You no longer have to risk your life
trying to track them down.

836
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:46,152
They can come to you.

837
01:21:48,134 --> 01:21:50,190
So you can do whatever you want.

838
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:56,711
So...

839
01:21:58,326 --> 01:22:00,016
what do you want to do?

840
01:22:00,279 --> 01:22:01,565
<i>Yeah, what's next?</i>

841
01:22:04,701 --> 01:22:06,507
I want to go home.

842
01:22:10,506 --> 01:22:12,327
Will you come with me?

843
01:22:14,008 --> 01:22:15,112
Anywhere.

1
00:00:02,447 --> 00:00:03,687
Previously on Fallen...

2
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:24,687
When God created Man, a jealous Lucifer
mounted a great rebellion|in Heaven.

3
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:28,647
His army of angels was defeated,
and forever banished from Paradise.

4
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:32,247
These angels, the Fallen,
abandoned Lucifer,

5
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:35,007
choosing to live on Earth
among the pleasures of humans.

6
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:38,327
They took mortal wives,
and fathered abominations...

7
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:40,047
children called Nephilim.

8
00:01:40,207 --> 00:01:42,967
They have the powers|of angels,
but the souls of men.

9
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:45,527
Angry, the Creator flooded the Earth,

10
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:48,207
killing the Nephilim and
driving the Fallen into hiding.

11
00:01:48,527 --> 00:01:53,087
He sent the Powers, fierce warrior angels,
to hunt those that survived the Flood.

12
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,887
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy:

13
00:01:57,087 --> 00:02:00,967
A Nephilim would be born,
who would redeem them

14
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,967
So the fallen watched...

15
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:04,607
and waited.

16
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,487
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.You?

17
00:02:13,407 --> 00:02:14,767
I'm not afraid
of anything.

18
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:20,207
I'm going to put
an end to this.
I'm not running
from them anymore.

19
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:34,327
Nephilim...
you face warriors of Heaven.

20
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:38,807
We fought in the greatest war
in the history of creation...
and won.

21
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,927
Do you really think
you stand a chance against us?

22
00:02:49,047 --> 00:02:50,087
Hello, Mazarin.

23
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,567
So, who wants
to die first?

24
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:58,167
This can't be.

25
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:02,127
That's exactly what Nathaniel said, moments
before I was dusting him off my boots.

26
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:08,447
Your, uh, scar's healing up.
Looks good... ish.

27
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:11,607
It is our mission to cleanse
the Earth of your kind,

28
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:14,887
and those that spawned you.
We will not abandon it.

29
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:19,567
We don't have to fight.
Just turn around and leave.

30
00:03:20,527 --> 00:03:25,927
- If you do that, no one has to die.
- Oh, come on. Someone always has to die.

31
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,007
That's part of the fun.

32
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:17,847
Kill him.

33
00:04:20,647 --> 00:04:21,407
Kill him!

34
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,807
I yield.

35
00:04:36,887 --> 00:04:38,247
Duly noted.

36
00:04:41,327 --> 00:04:42,687
What the hell
did you just do?

37
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,167
- He yielded.
- And?

38
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,207
There's a line that
I'm not going to cross.

39
00:04:49,487 --> 00:04:52,567
And as long as you're with me,
you're not going to cross it either.

40
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,887
I'm not with you.
You're with me.

41
00:04:56,527 --> 00:05:03,847
Listen to me. This Light Bringer,
he better be everything that you promised,

42
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,727
because I am running out of reasons
to hang around you.

43
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:11,127
Let go of me.
Come on.

44
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,807
The Light Bringer knows
everything about you, Aaron.

45
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:28,127
Who you are, where you came from.
You can learn it all.

46
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:33,087
We just have to get to him first
and I'm just trying to do

47
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,047
everything I can
to make sure you do.

48
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:48,447
You're free now.
Hurry, someone's coming.

49
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:02,247
Still out, Camael?

50
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:25,327
How did I make fire come
out of me like that?

51
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:30,287
- It just happened. I wasn't even trying.
- You don't need to, sweet cheeks.

52
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,567
It's instinct.

53
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,567
You don't have to be taught
how to use your powers.

54
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,447
The angel side of you already knows.

55
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:38,087
But your feeble, little human mind
gets in the way.

56
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:41,247
You just got to let go, let
the angel side take over.

57
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:44,127
You can't just let it take over.

58
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:46,927
That's like freeing a wild animal
that has no sense of..

59
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:50,367
good or evil, right or wrong.

60
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:54,887
You are so dramatic.
Well what about you, huh?

61
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,367
You just do whatever you feel like?

62
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,727
You don't care about
what you say who you hurt?

63
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,247
It's just how the good Lord made me.
I'm being true to my nature.

64
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,967
You should try it sometime.

65
00:07:11,567 --> 00:07:12,687
What is that noise?

66
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:16,527
Is something wrong?

67
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:22,047
I think the car is about done.
What'd you do to it?

68
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,247
Human-made
piece of crap!

69
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:30,047
Well, never mind, we're going
to have to foot now, anyway.

70
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:33,807
Where are we going?
Yeah, see those mountains over there?

71
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:37,207
That is where we're going
to find the Light Bringer.

72
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,967
This is turning out
to be a really bad day.

73
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:08,527
Leave me.
I need to speak to the Creator.

74
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:30,607
Nothing in the year since I've taken over
the Powers is what I've accomplished.

75
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,647
Under my command,
we've remained faithful.

76
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,207
We've continued and will continue
to pursue the abominations,

77
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,447
until they stain your planet no longer.

78
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:45,167
Is that what you perceive
your mission to be, Mazarin?

79
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:46,167
Michael.

80
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,287
Camael?

81
00:08:52,447 --> 00:08:55,247
Oh, God. What have they done to you?

82
00:08:57,567 --> 00:08:59,087
- Hold still, Camael.
- No.

83
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,647
Yes, you have to take
the healing, you have to.

84
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,687
- What?
- Aaron...

85
00:09:10,127 --> 00:09:13,527
We must find Aaron.

86
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:17,887
What?

87
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,447
It would be a whole lot easier
if we could just fly there.

88
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:22,927
But I don't have any wings, genius.

89
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:27,127
I don't know how to fly.
Hey, guys, can I help you with anything?

90
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:30,967
You bet you can.

91
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,687
We wanted to see if we
could get some camping gear.

92
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,767
You headed up to the mountains?

93
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,367
You seem like an outdoorsy kind of a gal.

94
00:09:39,767 --> 00:09:42,967
Do you ever play
any... indoor sports?

95
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,767
Sorry, he doesn't
get out much.

96
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,927
You might need something
warmer than that. Come on.

97
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,287
Listen, I don't how we're going to pay
for this stuff. I'm running out of cash.

98
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:02,087
- Where did you get that?
- Remember that waitress from the diner?

99
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,287
Yeah.

100
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,887
Remember that line
you told me not to cross?

101
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:08,767
- Yeah.
- I crossed it.

102
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,767
But, in my defense, it was
before you told me not to.

103
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:20,207
Is that your boyfriend? Not the guy with
the French fries, the other one.

104
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:21,487
Why?

105
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:24,647
No reason. He's cute.

106
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,807
Yeah. I know.

107
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,207
So, is he your boyfriend or not?

108
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,407
I'm not sure.

109
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:43,327
Lesbian.
Had to be.

110
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:48,767
Will you get over it?
Everybody gets rejected sometimes.

111
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,967
Not me. Nobody rejects me, ever.

112
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,887
Well, I know you think you're
God's gift to women, but,

113
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,527
I just don't see it. Sorry.

114
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:01,007
Oh, you don't, do you?

115
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:08,607
If I turned it on, sweetheart, you
wouldn't know what to do with yourself.

116
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:12,687
The only reason I haven't is because
the Redeemer's sweet on you.

117
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,247
- Ignore him.
- You can't ignore me. It's impossible.

118
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:29,407
They lose a little something when
they get cold, don't they?

119
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:31,487
Hey guys, come on, let's go.

120
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,047
How much further?

121
00:11:46,607 --> 00:11:49,047
We won't get there
till tomorrow morning.

122
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,327
Ariel...

123
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:53,367
I'm dying.

124
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,487
- Don't say that. I can...
- You can give me

125
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:58,527
a little more time.

126
00:12:01,727 --> 00:12:04,207
More strength.
That is all.

127
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:10,287
Perhaps this is what I deserve.
I clipped many an angel's wings

128
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:14,047
when I led the Powers.
I clipped yours.

129
00:12:14,687 --> 00:12:18,767
At least you didn't use angelfire.
Not on you, Ariel.

130
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:07,367
Sorry, I haven't seen her.
Are you sure?

131
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:13,687
Take another look, she's probably
traveling with a boy around her age.

132
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,967
Are you sure you haven't seen her?

133
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,567
Look, if she was in here,
I don't remember her, all right?

134
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:21,887
Sorry I couldn't have been more help.

135
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:41,927
Hey, Scott, it's Deborah. Would you mind
coming by the store for a little while?

136
00:13:43,087 --> 00:13:44,567
There's this guy...

137
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:51,807
This is the last time
I'm going to ask you nicely.

138
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,647
When was the girl here
and where did she go?

139
00:14:00,995 --> 00:14:04,315
Lord Michael,
mightiest of angels,

140
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,715
he who cast the rebels from Heaven.

141
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:11,835
That'll be enough of that, Mazarin.
On your feet. Let's speak as equals.

142
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:16,875
The Powers need guidance, Michael.

143
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,635
Aren't you meant to guide them?
Isn't that your charge?

144
00:14:19,755 --> 00:14:21,035
I'm not sure I'm worthy.

145
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:25,195
The Powers were instrumental
in squashing Lucifer's rebellion.

146
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:30,155
You and your clan killed more rebels
than the rest of the clans combined.

147
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:35,715
That was not a compliment.
The rebellion tested us all.

148
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:38,995
For the first time,
we were given free will,

149
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:43,355
the ability to chose not only who
we fought for, but how we fought.

150
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,595
Do you understand what I'm saying?

151
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,875
I'm trying to tell you that the Powers
earned an exile as well.

152
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,195
Not so different from the Fallen.

153
00:14:55,435 --> 00:14:58,275
Exile?
But...

154
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,395
But we remained faithful.

155
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:02,875
Which is why you were
given a noble mission...

156
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:07,115
to protect Earth against
threats to the Divine Plan.

157
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:08,995
And are we wrong?

158
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:13,155
Are we not meant
to destroy the Nephilim?

159
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,235
Is this boy really
who Camael says he is?

160
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,595
That's for you to decide.

161
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:24,835
There's at least one threat to the
planet of which you are certain.

162
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,275
Azazel.

163
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:31,075
To defeat him...

164
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:36,755
you may very well need the help of the
boy you've been trying so hard to kill.

165
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,555
You know, Azazel,
you're not doing that right.

166
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:47,035
Yes, I know I'm not
doing it right, Gabe.

167
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:48,755
You sure that doesn't go over there?

168
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:51,195
Gabe, I've just realized what
I'm supposed to do with this,

169
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:52,915
and you're not going
to like it.

170
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,515
Can't we just play
with these sticks instead?

171
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:59,475
Why am I doing this?
I don't even sleep.

172
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:03,875
You're no fun.

173
00:16:45,235 --> 00:16:46,155
Try it.

174
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,755
- I don't know how.
- You did it earlier.

175
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,955
Look, the angel inside of you
already knows how to do it.

176
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,555
The trick is to tap into that
knowledge without letting it take over.

177
00:16:57,595 --> 00:16:59,835
- Go on, give it a shot.
- No.

178
00:17:01,115 --> 00:17:02,835
Come on, just try it.

179
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,635
Picture it in your mind, okay?

180
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,755
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. Hey...

181
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:19,475
Focus.

182
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,395
Okay.

183
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:30,275
Okay, great. Now just picture the flame

184
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,395
jumping from your hand into the fire.

185
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,035
All it takes is just a little nudge.

186
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,395
- I did it.
- Told you.

187
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:03,155
So you really don't
want to be redeemed?

188
00:18:04,075 --> 00:18:05,035
Ever?

189
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:07,835
Heaven's just not for me. That's all.

190
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:14,275
It's not all sitting around on clouds,
playing harps and all that crap, you know?

191
00:18:14,435 --> 00:18:18,715
So how much further to this Day Lighter,
or whatever you call him?

192
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:19,955
Light Bringer.

193
00:18:21,755 --> 00:18:24,235
I don't know how much
further, sweetheart.

194
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:26,515
I didn't get the most
precise directions.

195
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:30,275
- So you don't even know where we're going.
- We're in the right general area.

196
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:34,395
And from what I understand, it's damn
near impossible to miss the place.

197
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,795
Why were you imprisoned?

198
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:42,355
None of the other Fallen
were, right? Just you.

199
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,355
I'm not just any other
Fallen, sweetheart.

200
00:18:47,955 --> 00:18:50,035
- I used to lead them.
- You led them?

201
00:18:50,675 --> 00:18:54,435
Almost straight to Hell. It was my idea
to come to Earth, you know?

202
00:18:58,395 --> 00:18:59,355
We made a decent team,

203
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:03,675
Lucifer and me, but it was a
temporary alliance from the start.

204
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,835
I never wanted to take over
Heaven like he did.

205
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:09,315
I was fighting for the right to leave it.

206
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:17,275
- Where are you going?
- To take a leak.

207
00:19:17,795 --> 00:19:18,995
To take a leak?

208
00:19:19,715 --> 00:19:23,915
- I thought angels didn't take leaks.
- I'll figure something out.

209
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,155
Aaron, are you sure we can trust him?

210
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,595
Azazel? Yeah.

211
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:43,315
- I mean, he saved our lives twice.
- Yeah, but...

212
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:45,915
Yeah.

213
00:19:47,515 --> 00:19:50,795
But it doesn't seem like
he's fighting to protect us,

214
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,395
as much as he just likes to fight.

215
00:19:56,715 --> 00:19:58,675
Well, at least
he's on our side.

216
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:02,715
You sure about that?

217
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:06,275
Yeah.

218
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:12,355
I just hope you're not looking for answers
so hard, you can't see anything else.

219
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:34,486
waffles, whipped cream, syrup.

220
00:20:35,726 --> 00:20:38,766
- He's dreaming.
- Yeah, I know.

221
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:44,886
Sounds like his dreams
are a lot better than mine.

222
00:20:47,726 --> 00:20:50,446
What are they like,
your dreams?

223
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:52,486
It's the same one...

224
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,526
over and over again.

225
00:20:57,326 --> 00:21:00,686
I'm fighting some kind of war,

226
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:03,766
except I don't even know...

227
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,486
whose side I'm on.

228
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:12,206
I'm just kind
of walking around,

229
00:21:13,846 --> 00:21:16,326
and cutting down everyone
in front of me.

230
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:21,606
It's like I'm some kind
of monster or something.

231
00:21:26,046 --> 00:21:27,566
You're not a monster.

232
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:34,126
- It's just a dream.
- What if it's not a dream?

233
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:39,366
What if that's the real me?

234
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,926
That's all of this,
that's the dream.

235
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:50,446
Funny, I've been afraid that
I'm the one who's dreaming.

236
00:21:51,446 --> 00:21:56,566
Like, I'm going to wake up any minute
and find myself back in Lukas' attic.

237
00:21:59,006 --> 00:21:59,966
You know,

238
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:04,366
I thought about you all the time.

239
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:11,086
I still can't even
believe that you're here

240
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,246
Right next to me.

241
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:37,646
I'm sorry.

242
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:43,686
No, you're beautiful.

243
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,566
Vanity is a sin,
Azazel.

244
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:08,046
If the Creator hadn't wanted
me to admire myself,

245
00:23:08,726 --> 00:23:10,726
he wouldn't have made me so pretty.

246
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:18,086
- How are we  progressing?
- You'll have him tomorrow.

247
00:23:18,526 --> 00:23:22,086
Good. I knew if anyone could
come through for me, it would be you.

248
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:25,046
I'm the only one who would
and the only one who could.

249
00:23:25,286 --> 00:23:27,966
Which brings us to your
part of the bargain.

250
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:35,006
When this is over, I want my freedom.

251
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,046
- I'm never going back  to that pit again.
- I see.

252
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,846
You're concerned that I'm going to
renege on my agreement

253
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,126
and imprison you again.

254
00:23:45,526 --> 00:23:48,046
You should learn to be
more trusting, Azazel.

255
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,686
- It's good for the soul.
- Too bad I don't have one.

256
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:56,686
Azazel, is that you?

257
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:40,526
Gabe, come on, wake up, boy.

258
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,566
- Oh, thank God I found you.
- Found me?

259
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:53,486
I'm lost, I walked off the trail two
days ago. I have no idea where I am.

260
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:57,806
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am now.

261
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:02,686
Hey, look, I haven't eaten in a
long time, you got any extra food?

262
00:25:02,966 --> 00:25:04,246
Yeah, we have plenty of food.

263
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:08,726
Thanks. I can't tell you how
much I appreciate this.

264
00:25:25,926 --> 00:25:30,166
Nephilim may have the powers of angels,
but your biology is mostly human,

265
00:25:30,926 --> 00:25:32,486
unfortunately for you.

266
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:42,166
Ariel, this is the site
of Anane's redemption.

267
00:25:57,726 --> 00:26:00,446
- I was wondering when you'd show up.
- Azazel is free.

268
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,606
And he's with your Nephilim.

269
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,166
You're not taking me back there.

270
00:26:28,246 --> 00:26:30,606
Grasic's dead. It's the Redeemer I want.

271
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:41,806
Naughty.

272
00:27:18,742 --> 00:27:19,942
You're okay.

273
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:27,422
- Who is that guy?
- That's the man who kidnapped me.

274
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,662
Look at all this stuff.

275
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:35,022
These are pretty cool.

276
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,782
You know, if I hadn't have come galloping
to your rescue, both your heads

277
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:40,062
would be mounted on a
wall somewhere by now.

278
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:42,022
No.

279
00:27:43,942 --> 00:27:48,062
He said he wanted Aaron alive.
He knows that you're the Redeemer.

280
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:56,182
Wake up.

281
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:00,462
Who are you?

282
00:28:01,862 --> 00:28:04,462
You with the Order, huh?
Answer me!

283
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,262
Aaron, stop it!

284
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:12,142
What do you people want from me?
What do you think we want?

285
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:14,702
We want redemption.

286
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:19,062
Did you really think your powers
can only be used on the Fallen?

287
00:28:21,302 --> 00:28:24,742
His power wasn't meant for you.
It was meant for us.

288
00:28:25,262 --> 00:28:28,502
That's not true. You can send
anyone you want to Heaven,

289
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:30,742
whether they deserve it or not.

290
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:31,942
Yeah.

291
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,382
Yeah, whether they worship
graven images or not,

292
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:41,542
whether they covet their neighbor's
wife, if they repent or not.

293
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,342
I would never use my powers like that.

294
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,462
The stench of death
is all over you, my friend.

295
00:29:00,662 --> 00:29:02,742
You don't have
long left, do you?

296
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:05,542
I have a brain tumor,

297
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:08,622
that's why I need you.

298
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:13,182
I've done a lot of bad things in my life,

299
00:29:14,822 --> 00:29:18,182
things that can never be forgiven,
but you can pardon me,

300
00:29:20,102 --> 00:29:26,062
you can keep me from going to Hell.
You can wash me clean of my sins.

301
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:30,382
Please, please.

302
00:29:31,782 --> 00:29:32,742
Sorry.

303
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,062
- I can't do that.
- No.

304
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:42,502
No. You're going to have
to pay for what you've done.

305
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:58,782
You just killed him.

306
00:30:02,582 --> 00:30:05,782
- Why would you do that?
- He was dying anyway.

307
00:30:12,022 --> 00:30:15,102
He kidnapped your girlfriend, sold her,

308
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:20,382
he was trying to use you to get a
bunch of sinners into Heaven.

309
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:23,462
Leave him.

310
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:26,462
He's nothing to us.

311
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,582
Aaron...

312
00:30:33,902 --> 00:30:38,342
- this is wrong.
- I know.

313
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:45,222
I don't know why Azazel is free,

314
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:48,662
or what he's doing
with the Redeemer.

315
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:52,142
I served under Azazel.

316
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,902
Locking him up was the only
good thing you Powers ever did.

317
00:30:57,302 --> 00:31:01,942
Mazarin, take to the sky. Scout ahead.
Look for any traces of angel activity.

318
00:31:02,222 --> 00:31:03,702
Sachael, come with us.

319
00:31:04,182 --> 00:31:06,022
We don't take orders
from you anymore, Camael.

320
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:09,702
You will. That is the only way
we're going to do this.

321
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:18,222
Is it always going to be like this?
I don't know if I can do this, Aaron,

322
00:31:19,782 --> 00:31:22,902
all this running
and fighting and killing.

323
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,822
I don't like it either.

324
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:30,662
Part of you must.

325
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,742
I've seen it... when you fight.

326
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,182
Sometimes it looks
like you're enjoying it.

327
00:31:41,262 --> 00:31:42,582
Just like Azazel.

328
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:48,942
I'm nothing like Azazel.

329
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:59,382
Why are we doing this anyway? What is it
you want to learn from this Light Bringer?

330
00:32:04,062 --> 00:32:05,502
Maybe he can tell me

331
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,902
more about where I come from.

332
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:12,222
Why I have all these visions and

333
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:14,982
all these dreams, and why I have all
this anger inside of me,

334
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:16,862
and just what it means to be the Redeemer.

335
00:32:19,462 --> 00:32:20,982
Maybe he can tell me who I am.

336
00:32:22,262 --> 00:32:24,862
Aaron, no one can
tell you that.

337
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,342
You need to decide
for yourself who you are.

338
00:32:29,702 --> 00:32:31,582
Then you should try to ve up to that.

339
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:58,742
- There it is.
- This is it?

340
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:01,342
Yeah, that's where |you're going.

341
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,782
- You sure this is the place?
- Have I ever lied to you?

342
00:33:54,662 --> 00:33:58,262
- This isn't for you.
- Why can't you come?

343
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:01,262
This isn't about us, Aaron.

344
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:04,582
Aaron, this doesn't feel right.

345
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:07,582
Don't go in there.

346
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:10,502
I have to.

347
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:51,182
Hello?

348
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:03,422
Anybody here?

349
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:50,422
You'll have to forgive me.

350
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,542
I wasn't expecting
you so soon.

351
00:37:00,462 --> 00:37:02,662
I've waited a long
time to meet you.

352
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:07,662
- Are you the Light Bringer?
- I am.

353
00:37:09,142 --> 00:37:14,262
- And you're Aaron Corbett, the Redeemer.
- How do you know|my name?

354
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:19,782
This meeting, like your birth,
was foretold to me long ago.

355
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:21,782
So it is true.

356
00:37:24,982 --> 00:37:26,822
You did write
the prophecy about me.

357
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:29,182
Yes.

358
00:37:30,622 --> 00:37:32,702
You've come here
looking for answers,

359
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:37,902
to learn where you come from, so that you
can better understand where you're going.

360
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:40,982
I have so much
to tell you, Aaron.

361
00:37:42,942 --> 00:37:47,142
I can help you learn the truth,
if you're strong enough to face it.

362
00:37:49,782 --> 00:37:50,702
Are you?

363
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,062
Yes...

364
00:37:56,662 --> 00:37:57,582
I am.

365
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:08,102
How are you doing
back there?

366
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:13,342
I would not have had
your wings removed, Camael.

367
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:16,022
That was Mazarin's
doing, not mine.

368
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:18,742
I remember, Sachael.

369
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:22,662
He's a good soldier,
you know that,

370
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:26,302
but your desertion broke his heart.

371
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:41,022
Might want to get comfortable, love.
This might take a while.

372
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:54,262
What is this place?

373
00:38:56,422 --> 00:39:00,382
It's a monastery,
or rather, it was.

374
00:39:03,422 --> 00:39:05,422
It hasn't been
used in decades.

375
00:39:06,142 --> 00:39:10,422
In fact, you're the first living soul
I've seen here in years.

376
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:18,142
People don't often
find their way here.

377
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:22,982
Not unless they're
seeking me out.

378
00:39:26,062 --> 00:39:29,502
Now you must be very tired.
Maybe you'd like to sit down?

379
00:39:57,982 --> 00:39:59,742
So do you really
know everything about me?

380
00:40:02,542 --> 00:40:03,742
Hardly.

381
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:09,422
But I am very curious to hear
what you know about yourself,

382
00:40:09,502 --> 00:40:11,542
or what you believe you know.

383
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:15,662
Well, I know that
my father is an angel.

384
00:40:18,622 --> 00:40:19,662
And my mother is dead.

385
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:27,102
Does that disturb you, knowing that
your father allowed your mother to die?

386
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:31,942
He didn't allow|her to die.

387
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,742
He killed her.

388
00:40:38,222 --> 00:40:42,382
Is that how you view your conception?
As murder?

389
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:46,702
Isn't that what it is?

390
00:40:47,582 --> 00:40:50,302
The Fallen know that a human
can't survive a Nephilim's birth.

391
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:54,702
Our mothers die
the second we're born,

392
00:40:56,462 --> 00:41:00,662
and we're left alone, to spend the rest
of our lives running from the Powers.

393
00:41:01,982 --> 00:41:04,022
It's selfish
and it's cruel,

394
00:41:06,062 --> 00:41:07,462
and the truth is,

395
00:41:09,382 --> 00:41:13,062
I don't know if any of the Fallen
are truly worthy of redemption.

396
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,182
We should have
left him behind.

397
00:41:31,102 --> 00:41:32,542
He's a liability.

398
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:38,062
The Nephilim won't trust us without
Ariel and Camael. We need them.

399
00:41:45,422 --> 00:41:47,382
I don't blame you for being angry,

400
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:51,662
but the way you look
at your mother's death,

401
00:41:52,942 --> 00:41:55,182
it does her a great disservice.

402
00:41:56,262 --> 00:41:57,662
What do you mean?

403
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:04,222
You paint her as a... a victim instead
of the martyr she truly was.

404
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:07,622
I loved her very much.

405
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:11,062
You... You loved her?

406
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:13,862
Yes, Aaron.

407
00:42:15,262 --> 00:42:16,582
I'm your father.

408
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:35,095
I know how
you must be feeling.

409
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,415
There were times when
I really need a father.

410
00:42:39,215 --> 00:42:40,495
Where were you?

411
00:42:41,455 --> 00:42:43,895
I was here,
waiting for you.

412
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,695
I couldn't have
raised you, Aaron.

413
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:51,815
For your own protection you need to
remain hidden until you came of age.

414
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:56,055
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.
You have no idea how sorry.

415
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,415
I just hope that you can
find it in your heart to forgive me.

416
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:01,975
To forgive you?

417
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,535
I can feel it when a Fallen

418
00:43:06,775 --> 00:43:08,095
wants redemption,

419
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:11,615
and I have never
felt it as strongly

420
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:13,935
as I do right now.

421
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:16,735
Is that what you want?

422
00:43:17,535 --> 00:43:19,695
From me to send you
back to Heaven?

423
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:22,695
You are the Redeemer.

424
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:26,975
And when the time is right,
when you

425
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:30,375
are absolutely certain that I have
atoned for my sins,

426
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:34,415
yes, perhaps you will
return me to Paradise.

427
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:39,175
And that is when you will have
fulfilled your destiny.

428
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,935
So that's what
all of this is about?

429
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:46,135
That's why I have
all this power?

430
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,615
Just so I can redeem you?

431
00:43:50,215 --> 00:43:52,775
All the Fallen must return
to Heaven, Aaron.

432
00:43:52,815 --> 00:43:54,295
That's the prophecy.

433
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:57,975
But if I don't return
to Heaven myself, then...

434
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,935
then it was... all for nothing.

435
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:22,495
From the moment I took up arms
against the Creator

436
00:44:23,415 --> 00:44:26,855
to the day that I had my vision that
foretold your coming...

437
00:44:30,055 --> 00:44:31,575
Oh, I denied it at first,

438
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,735
but after I thought about it,
it made perfect sense...

439
00:44:36,175 --> 00:44:37,535
that this Redeemer

440
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,135
would come from a Fallen
that needed forgiveness most.

441
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,535
The one who started it all.

442
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:48,015
Who are you?

443
00:44:49,135 --> 00:44:50,175
Who am I?

444
00:44:52,535 --> 00:44:55,415
I am nothing but what you see
before you, Aaron.

445
00:44:56,815 --> 00:44:58,055
A fallen angel,

446
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:00,775
the Bringer of Light...

447
00:45:03,455 --> 00:45:04,495
Your father.

448
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:08,175
I want to know your name.

449
00:45:09,575 --> 00:45:11,255
I have so many names.

450
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:14,375
More than I can even
remember myself.

451
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:18,495
But the one
the Creator gave me...

452
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:22,655
is Lucifer.

453
00:45:25,415 --> 00:45:26,335
No.

454
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:27,935
Yes, Aaron.

455
00:45:28,095 --> 00:45:31,935
I am Lucifer Morningstar, first of
the Fallen, and you are my son.

456
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,455
I don't believe you.

457
00:45:36,495 --> 00:45:37,535
Yes, you do.

458
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:41,135
You know it's true.
You can feel it.

459
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,975
- My blood has been crying out to you.
- Get away from me!

460
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:46,775
Stay away!

461
00:45:54,735 --> 00:45:55,775
Aaron.

462
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:03,455
Don't come any closer.

463
00:46:04,255 --> 00:46:06,455
I am not the son
of the Devil.

464
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,495
And I am not what
you believe me to be.

465
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:13,055
Please, let me
make you understand.

466
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:14,535
I do understand.

467
00:46:15,615 --> 00:46:19,735
I finally understand what all of these
dreams have been trying to tell me.

468
00:46:21,255 --> 00:46:22,175
Dreams?

469
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:24,695
I see myself as evil.

470
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:27,255
I see myself as a monster,

471
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,055
like you.

472
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:32,535
Whatever you think I am,

473
00:46:33,055 --> 00:46:36,215
please give me the chance
to convince you otherwise.

474
00:46:36,415 --> 00:46:37,575
Or strike me down now.

475
00:46:37,695 --> 00:46:39,455
I shall make no move
to stop you.

476
00:46:41,015 --> 00:46:43,215
My fate is entirely
in your hands.

477
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:02,015
I knew you would make
the right decision.

478
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,015
You always do.

479
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:02,015
Ariel.

480
00:48:03,335 --> 00:48:04,695
Azazel did this.

481
00:48:05,455 --> 00:48:06,695
I can smell him.

482
00:48:11,095 --> 00:48:12,935
Azazel is a force
of nature.

483
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,495
He will never change.

484
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:16,535
But realigning with Lucifer?

485
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:19,855
After all it's cost us?

486
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,655
Lucifer?

487
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:24,255
Lucifer is involved
in this?

488
00:48:25,695 --> 00:48:27,215
He wants the Redeemer.

489
00:48:28,975 --> 00:48:30,855
He used Azazel to get him.

490
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:48,655
Can Lucifer use this boy
to return to Heaven?

491
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:54,975
Why do you think I've been trying
so very hard to protect him?

492
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,815
I've been trying to prevent
this very thing from happening.

493
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,015
Azazel got to Aaron
because of you.

494
00:49:02,575 --> 00:49:05,855
He's in Lucifer's hands now
because of you.

495
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,495
The world as we know it

496
00:49:08,975 --> 00:49:10,575
may be about to end...

497
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:14,535
because of you.

498
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:38,415
Do you know why
I rebelled, Aaron?

499
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,655
It's because you wanted
to take over Heaven,

500
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:44,655
steal it from the Creator.

501
00:49:46,375 --> 00:49:49,015
As they say, history is written
by the winners.

502
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:52,175
You know, the truth is...

503
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:55,535
I only wanted the freedom
to choose my own destiny.

504
00:49:56,135 --> 00:49:59,455
But it is not better to reign in Hell
than it is to serve in Heaven.

505
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:03,055
I didn't construct Hell

506
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:06,775
to be a haven
for the Creator's rejects.

507
00:50:07,095 --> 00:50:09,855
But when more of them started to come
to me instead of Heaven...

508
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:14,575
You assumed the Creator gave up on them.

509
00:50:15,415 --> 00:50:16,375
Yes.

510
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,575
Humans love to disobey.

511
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:24,575
None of it's true, then?

512
00:50:25,095 --> 00:50:28,735
All of the horrible things you're
supposed to be responsible for?

513
00:50:28,935 --> 00:50:30,255
They're all lies?

514
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:32,855
No.

515
00:50:35,855 --> 00:50:37,735
No, I'm not saying
I'm perfect.

516
00:50:39,175 --> 00:50:42,215
But your arrival tells me
that I have atoned.

517
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:45,095
More than that,
I know it in my heart.

518
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:48,575
When all the angels
have reunited in Heaven,

519
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:53,895
then we can restore the Earth to the
reflection of Paradise it was meant to be.

520
00:50:56,975 --> 00:50:59,255
You could bring us all
back together.

521
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,935
And what if I don't?

522
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:10,215
Well, you've seen the signs...

523
00:51:12,495 --> 00:51:16,855
war, famine, pestilence, death.
It's all around us.

524
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,255
These are the End Times, Aaron.

525
00:51:22,855 --> 00:51:24,815
The Day of Judgment is coming.

526
00:51:27,295 --> 00:51:29,055
And only you can stop it.

527
00:51:41,055 --> 00:51:43,495
How long is he going
to be in there for?

528
00:51:44,735 --> 00:51:46,175
As long as it takes.

529
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:48,335
As long as what takes?

530
00:51:48,335 --> 00:51:50,135
For him to accept the truth.

531
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:52,935
What truth?
Is he going to be all right?

532
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:55,575
The truth hurts.

533
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,415
Sometimes it hurts more than others.

534
00:52:06,775 --> 00:52:07,895
I'm going in there.

535
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,615
I wouldn't do that
if I were you, sweetheart.

536
00:52:12,055 --> 00:52:14,375
No, of course you wouldn't.

537
00:52:14,935 --> 00:52:17,775
You wouldn't do anything
unless there's something in it for you.

538
00:52:17,815 --> 00:52:20,495
Is this Light Bringer
the one who freed you?

539
00:52:21,415 --> 00:52:23,135
Is this why you brought
Aaron over here?

540
00:52:23,175 --> 00:52:26,215
You've got me all figured out,
don't you, sweetcheeks?

541
00:52:27,935 --> 00:52:29,855
Yeah, I made a deal with him.

542
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:32,895
And deals with him don't come cheap.

543
00:52:33,935 --> 00:52:35,695
What are you talking about?

544
00:52:35,895 --> 00:52:39,615
You can speak every
conceivable language.

545
00:52:39,935 --> 00:52:42,535
You don't even understand what you know.

546
00:52:43,375 --> 00:52:45,735
What is "Light Bringer" in Latin?

547
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,295
Lucifer.

548
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:55,335
Right.

549
00:52:56,495 --> 00:52:58,295
Aaron put his faith in you.

550
00:52:59,935 --> 00:53:01,015
He's a fool.

551
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,055
I'm coming, too.

552
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,859
I can smell him, Vilma.

553
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:54,419
Hello?

554
00:53:57,579 --> 00:53:58,579
Aaron?

555
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,139
Aaron?

556
00:54:24,019 --> 00:54:25,099
Who's that?

557
00:54:29,539 --> 00:54:30,579
Lucifer.

558
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:12,539
So you're telling me that

559
00:55:14,459 --> 00:55:16,339
in order to save Earth

560
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:19,939
I have to send the Devil
back to Heaven?

561
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:26,819
I told you, I haven't
been the Devil in ages.

562
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:36,339
It was my vision of you

563
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:39,979
that inspired me to leave Hell

564
00:55:40,299 --> 00:55:42,299
and serve my penance on Earth.

565
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:49,419
Just like any of the Fallen.

566
00:55:52,259 --> 00:55:54,819
Just like the ones
you've already redeemed.

567
00:55:57,139 --> 00:56:00,499
Their sin was the same as mine
and you found them worthy.

568
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:03,539
Aaron...

569
00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:08,939
we all deserve forgiveness

570
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:11,779
if we truly want it.

571
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:14,659
You can't deny what your body
is telling you.

572
00:56:23,379 --> 00:56:24,339
Ok.

573
00:56:27,979 --> 00:56:28,939
Ok?

574
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:33,259
I'll do it.

575
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,499
Oh, thank you, son.

576
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:37,699
Thank you.

577
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:45,459
Give me your hand.

578
00:57:26,019 --> 00:57:29,099
I saw you. I saw the things
you've done.

579
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:31,379
I saw what you really are.

580
00:57:31,539 --> 00:57:34,259
No. No, you...
you saw me as I was.

581
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:36,939
I want to trust you.

582
00:57:38,379 --> 00:57:39,339
I do.

583
00:57:41,339 --> 00:57:42,419
But I can't.

584
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:48,899
Please, Aaron.
I'm your father.

585
00:57:50,659 --> 00:57:51,939
I came here...

586
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,619
looking for answers.

587
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,779
Like you were just going to say some
magic words

588
00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:00,739
and all of a sudden, my life would just
make sense.

589
00:58:02,219 --> 00:58:04,979
But I don't care what the prophecy says.

590
00:58:05,699 --> 00:58:08,179
I don't care what anybody
tells me to do.

591
00:58:09,579 --> 00:58:12,419
I know what feels right
and I know what doesn't.

592
00:58:14,819 --> 00:58:15,979
And this feels wrong.

593
00:58:20,419 --> 00:58:21,859
I can't redeem you.

594
00:58:24,619 --> 00:58:25,579
I won't.

595
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:37,099
Il gran rifiuto.

596
00:58:41,499 --> 00:58:42,939
I'm going home now.

597
00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:47,939
No, Aaron.

598
00:58:50,139 --> 00:58:51,859
You're not going anywhere.

599
00:59:03,859 --> 00:59:04,979
Where are we?

600
00:59:19,397 --> 00:59:22,117
No! No! No!

601
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:23,917
Just finished.

602
00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:25,957
You're safe now.

603
00:59:27,677 --> 00:59:29,677
This was my punishment...

604
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:32,117
an eternity without you.

605
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:35,837
But you came back to me,
thank God.

606
00:59:35,877 --> 00:59:37,437
No! No!

607
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:40,877
Lukas, you can't do this to me.

608
00:59:41,357 --> 00:59:43,877
Maybe this is Heaven after all.

609
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:08,797
Where are we?

610
01:00:11,437 --> 01:00:12,757
The monastery

611
01:00:13,557 --> 01:00:15,637
is where I broke through, Aaron.

612
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:19,317
My portal to Earth.

613
01:00:21,597 --> 01:00:24,077
I'm not able to leave
its grounds, but...

614
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:27,637
I am allowed certain
comforts of home here.

615
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:31,477
To enter these walls

616
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:34,957
is to enter Hell itself.

617
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:37,797
This is Hell?

618
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:41,637
Yes.

619
01:00:43,837 --> 01:00:45,877
This is my dominion.

620
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:48,917
And you,

621
01:00:49,317 --> 01:00:50,997
like these poor souls,

622
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:54,277
are now a prisoner here.

623
01:00:55,997 --> 01:00:57,677
But I am offering you

624
01:00:58,397 --> 01:01:02,357
something that the rest of my guests
would do anything to have.

625
01:01:03,517 --> 01:01:05,077
A way out.

626
01:01:10,117 --> 01:01:11,957
Send me home, son,

627
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:13,677
to Paradise.

628
01:01:15,277 --> 01:01:16,877
So you can take over?

629
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,837
Is that what you want?

630
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:23,997
No.

631
01:01:24,877 --> 01:01:26,277
I won't let you.

632
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:30,877
And if I have to spend
an eternity in Hell

633
01:01:31,237 --> 01:01:33,517
to make sure that you never get there,

634
01:01:35,597 --> 01:01:38,237
that's a sacrifice
that I'm willing to make.

635
01:01:42,037 --> 01:01:43,677
How noble of you.

636
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:46,877
But...

637
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:50,157
what of the lovely
Ms. Rodriguez?

638
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:53,237
She entered the monastery
looking for you.

639
01:01:53,477 --> 01:01:55,117
But she found...

640
01:01:56,397 --> 01:01:57,717
something else.

641
01:01:58,517 --> 01:01:59,797
Where is she?

642
01:02:00,357 --> 01:02:01,597
She's in my care.

643
01:02:02,117 --> 01:02:03,877
And she will remain there

644
01:02:04,957 --> 01:02:07,797
until you do
what you were born to do.

645
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,477
I don't believe you.

646
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,477
This is another one
of your lies.

647
01:02:16,997 --> 01:02:17,957
Is it?

648
01:02:23,037 --> 01:02:24,557
Look down there.

649
01:02:30,277 --> 01:02:31,677
I knew, Vilma.

650
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,277
Vilma!

651
01:02:33,277 --> 01:02:34,797
I always knew

652
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,837
that we'd end up together.

653
01:02:39,877 --> 01:02:43,197
It's not the Redeemer
you belong with.

654
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:47,477
It's me, Vilma.

655
01:02:49,877 --> 01:02:51,317
There were times

656
01:02:51,677 --> 01:02:53,717
when you were happy with me.

657
01:02:55,357 --> 01:02:56,837
Do you rember?

658
01:02:58,157 --> 01:02:59,917
You'll be happy again.

659
01:03:02,757 --> 01:03:05,277
She can't hear
or see you, Aaron.

660
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:08,117
Just look at her.

661
01:03:08,757 --> 01:03:11,677
An eternity as a prisoner
of that twisted old man.

662
01:03:11,957 --> 01:03:14,637
It's one thing
to sacrifice yourself, Aaron.

663
01:03:15,317 --> 01:03:18,197
But are you willing to damn
the woman you love?

664
01:03:21,157 --> 01:03:22,717
Wipe these runes away.

665
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:25,237
If I brush away
those markings,

666
01:03:25,917 --> 01:03:28,157
then I'll condemn myself

667
01:03:30,397 --> 01:03:32,437
to eternal torment.

668
01:03:35,677 --> 01:03:37,117
If I don't...

669
01:03:40,277 --> 01:03:42,357
I'll condemn you.

670
01:04:03,277 --> 01:04:04,477
Go.

671
01:04:04,917 --> 01:04:06,197
Thank you.

672
01:04:08,237 --> 01:04:09,877
Just go.

673
01:04:17,117 --> 01:04:18,837
Well...

674
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:21,997
the esteemed Dr. Grasic
just earned himself

675
01:04:22,117 --> 01:04:24,437
an upgrade in his damnation.

676
01:04:29,597 --> 01:04:30,957
You couldn't
keep her here.

677
01:04:35,717 --> 01:04:37,557
You can't keep anyone here.

678
01:04:38,797 --> 01:04:40,997
You don't have
that kind of power.

679
01:04:41,357 --> 01:04:43,837
Hell is a choice that we make.

680
01:04:46,237 --> 01:04:48,797
The only real
prisoner here is you.

681
01:04:52,837 --> 01:04:54,357
You're so smart.

682
01:04:57,917 --> 01:04:59,477
I tried to be nice,

683
01:04:59,797 --> 01:05:01,877
I tried intimidation, and now

684
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:04,237
I have to resort to force.

685
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:05,517
Then go ahead.

686
01:05:07,197 --> 01:05:08,157
Kill me.

687
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,397
I'm not afraid.

688
01:05:22,534 --> 01:05:24,614
I didn't expect to see you again.

689
01:05:28,254 --> 01:05:30,294
Did you find
what you were looking for?

690
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:32,294
You sent Aaron to his doom.

691
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:34,294
You knew!

692
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,534
He trusted you.

693
01:05:37,094 --> 01:05:38,414
You can help him.

694
01:05:39,094 --> 01:05:41,294
You have to, Azazel.
I know you can.

695
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:42,494
Why would I?

696
01:05:43,294 --> 01:05:46,254
You know what it's like
to be held against your will.

697
01:05:46,774 --> 01:05:48,214
This is your chance

698
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:51,174
to make up for everything
that you've done wrong.

699
01:05:51,694 --> 01:05:52,734
Take it.

700
01:05:53,454 --> 01:05:55,134
Please, Azazel.|Please.

701
01:05:57,614 --> 01:05:58,574
Do it!

702
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,734
Do it or what?

703
01:06:02,894 --> 01:06:04,414
Or I'll kill you.

704
01:06:06,134 --> 01:06:07,894
I was thinking about it!

705
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,414
I was on the fence!

706
01:06:11,174 --> 01:06:14,334
But then you had to go
and ask me so politely.

707
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:18,374
I think I have
some time to kill.

708
01:06:21,134 --> 01:06:24,134
You're right, Aaron,
I can't keep you here in Hell.

709
01:06:24,654 --> 01:06:28,334
But I can persuade you
to be reasonable.

710
01:06:29,174 --> 01:06:32,494
And this time, don't expect Azazel
to come to your rescue.

711
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:34,894
Azazel knew what you wanted.

712
01:06:35,214 --> 01:06:36,614
He was in on this.

713
01:06:36,934 --> 01:06:38,414
Of course he was.

714
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:39,734
So,

715
01:06:40,534 --> 01:06:42,134
it comes down to this.

716
01:06:43,574 --> 01:06:45,294
If you stand against me,

717
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:48,014
you stand alone.

718
01:07:01,494 --> 01:07:04,134
I am the most powerful angel
that was ever created.

719
01:07:04,214 --> 01:07:06,814
Do you really believe
that you can beat me?

720
01:07:20,014 --> 01:07:23,254
The angel in me is just as powerful
as you are.

721
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:25,654
But my humanity
makes me stronger.

722
01:07:27,094 --> 01:07:28,214
Really?

723
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,094
You've been defeated before.

724
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:32,334
And once is enough.

725
01:07:55,934 --> 01:07:57,414
Not bad for a girl.

726
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:13,214
You know, I hate
hurting pretty girls!

727
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:17,454
But something about you
really pisses me off.

728
01:08:23,774 --> 01:08:24,734
Run!

729
01:08:25,574 --> 01:08:27,694
Camael.
I thought you were dead.

730
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:29,814
Let's see if we can fix that.

731
01:08:29,974 --> 01:08:31,454
This is where it ends.

732
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:50,734
Azazel, no!

733
01:09:07,374 --> 01:09:08,374
Azazel.

734
01:09:08,774 --> 01:09:09,774
Mazarin!

735
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:14,654
5,000 years ago,
I put you in chains.

736
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:16,894
Will you return willingly?

737
01:09:17,734 --> 01:09:19,134
Never!

738
01:09:19,494 --> 01:09:22,014
Then you leave me no choice
but to fight you to the death.

739
01:09:22,054 --> 01:09:23,894
Now you're speaking
my language!

740
01:09:24,094 --> 01:09:26,094
Let's do this!
Man to man!

741
01:10:14,694 --> 01:10:16,614
You are my son!

742
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:20,014
You were born to help me
destroy the Creator,

743
01:10:20,254 --> 01:10:22,894
and by God you are going
to live up to that!

744
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:27,774
Surrender, my son.

745
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:34,134
The prophecy.

746
01:10:36,534 --> 01:10:38,374
I don't care
about the prophecy.

747
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,374
I care about my destiny!

748
01:10:42,374 --> 01:10:43,814
This is my life!

749
01:10:44,174 --> 01:10:45,894
I'm taking control of it.

750
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:03,454
I'm sorry, son.

751
01:11:03,894 --> 01:11:06,334
I never meant for it
to end like this.

752
01:11:13,254 --> 01:11:15,174
Go ahead!
Say it!

753
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:21,574
Go to Hell!

754
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:40,374
Aaron!

755
01:11:40,974 --> 01:11:41,974
Gabe.

756
01:11:43,454 --> 01:11:45,014
Let's get out of here.

757
01:12:05,063 --> 01:12:06,183
Go ahead.

758
01:12:07,383 --> 01:12:08,423
Kill me.

759
01:12:10,263 --> 01:12:11,663
Kill me!

760
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:15,783
Give me a warrior's death.

761
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:19,023
You know you want to.

762
01:12:19,343 --> 01:12:20,503
No, Azazel.

763
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:24,383
I follow the Creator's orders.
Not yours.

764
01:12:28,903 --> 01:12:29,863
Ariel.

765
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,063
Ariel...

766
01:12:41,823 --> 01:12:43,383
Long time no see.

767
01:12:43,783 --> 01:12:45,063
Don't do it.

768
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:49,463
No, you're going back.

769
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:54,183
Then how about
a kiss good-night?

770
01:13:11,503 --> 01:13:13,463
I'm so glad
you're all right.

771
01:13:19,623 --> 01:13:20,623
Camael!

772
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:26,743
You're alive?

773
01:13:30,583 --> 01:13:32,023
What happened to you?

774
01:13:32,263 --> 01:13:35,223
Did you...
Did you see him?

775
01:13:37,263 --> 01:13:38,223
Aaron...

776
01:13:39,703 --> 01:13:42,903
did you meet... Lucifer?

777
01:13:43,823 --> 01:13:45,583
I sent him back to Hell...

778
01:13:47,703 --> 01:13:49,183
where he belongs.

779
01:13:55,303 --> 01:13:57,023
It's too late for me.

780
01:13:57,943 --> 01:13:59,983
I'm not going
to let you die.

781
01:14:02,183 --> 01:14:03,783
I'd never considered...

782
01:14:05,823 --> 01:14:07,343
that your powers

783
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:09,943
would apply to me.

784
01:14:12,583 --> 01:14:15,383
I've taken
so many lives, Aaron.

785
01:14:16,903 --> 01:14:18,583
I've killed so many.

786
01:14:21,703 --> 01:14:24,663
I... I have not earned

787
01:14:26,543 --> 01:14:27,903
my redemption.

788
01:14:32,543 --> 01:14:35,383
If anyone's earned
their redemption, Camael,

789
01:14:38,063 --> 01:14:39,103
it's you.

790
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:46,343
And I'm going
to send you home now.

791
01:14:56,423 --> 01:14:57,783
Good-bye, Camael.

792
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:03,023
Good-bye...

793
01:15:05,703 --> 01:15:06,863
my friend.

794
01:15:09,143 --> 01:15:10,743
I'll be watching you...

795
01:15:12,343 --> 01:15:13,303
Nephilim.

796
01:16:04,183 --> 01:16:05,263
Forgive me.

797
01:16:05,903 --> 01:16:08,583
You are indeed the Redeemer
of the prophecy.

798
01:16:14,943 --> 01:16:16,143
It's over.

799
01:16:16,983 --> 01:16:18,263
All of it.

800
01:16:19,103 --> 01:16:21,343
You're going to stop
killing the Fallen,

801
01:16:21,783 --> 01:16:22,983
the Nephilim.

802
01:16:24,423 --> 01:16:26,343
Find yourself
a new mission.

803
01:16:43,503 --> 01:16:44,623
Noooo!

804
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:47,023
No!

805
01:16:48,383 --> 01:16:51,863
Your sentence was to remain here
until Judgment Day, Azazel.

806
01:16:52,383 --> 01:16:54,823
But the Redeemer
has defeated Lucifer.

807
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:57,423
So that day may never come.

808
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:05,543
Well, I'm nothing
if not patient, Mazarin!

809
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:10,263
We'll just have to wait
and see, won't we?

810
01:17:35,623 --> 01:17:37,143
So what happens now?

811
01:17:40,103 --> 01:17:42,263
Well, Aaron,
that's really up to you.

812
01:17:46,743 --> 01:17:49,383
There are still a lot of Fallen
who need redemption, right?

813
01:17:49,383 --> 01:17:52,383
Yes, but everything's different now.
They can come out of hiding.

814
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:56,063
You no longer have to risk your life
trying to track them down.

815
01:17:56,783 --> 01:17:58,383
They can come to you.

816
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:02,263
So you can do whatever you want.

817
01:18:07,543 --> 01:18:08,503
So...

818
01:18:10,063 --> 01:18:11,663
what do you want to do?

819
01:18:11,943 --> 01:18:13,143
Yeah, what's next?

820
01:18:16,183 --> 01:18:17,903
I want to go home.

821
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:23,463
Will you come with me?

822
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:26,143
Anywhere.

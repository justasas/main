1
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,454
<i>Previously on</i> Fallen...

2
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:16,116
I think angels are here.

3
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,685
Don't you ever feel like you're
in the presence of something special?

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,168
I'm really scared.

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,731
I'm afraid there's something
wrong with me.

6
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:24,823
Aaron scared?

7
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:26,271
Aaron okay?

8
00:00:26,272 --> 00:00:28,701
A dog is not talking|to me.

9
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:30,115
But you are in danger...

10
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,079
Nephilim.

11
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:33,627
Why did you call me
Nephilim?

12
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:35,889
'Cause that's what|you are.
You're half angel, half human.

13
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,519
The Nephilim have
the powers of angels,

14
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,283
but the souls of man.

15
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:42,447
They are
the biblical half-breeds.

16
00:00:42,448 --> 00:00:43,928
The prophecy said
you would come,

17
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:45,459
and here you are.

18
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:48,771
He bears the names
of the Fallen.

19
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:51,750
He has the touch
of the angels.

20
00:00:52,016 --> 00:00:53,429
Uh, the Powers

21
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:57,240
think that they are the Creator's
personal storm troopers.

22
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,719
And their whole goal
is to get rid of Nephilim.

23
00:01:00,835 --> 00:01:02,498
And they absolutely

24
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:04,761
hate the Fallen.

25
00:01:05,111 --> 00:01:06,942
The important thing is
that Camael,

26
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,887
leader of the powers, is here,
and he's probably looking for you.

27
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,084
Sono secoli che ti sto cercando.

28
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,113
Sono stato sballottato in giro
sin da bambino.

29
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:15,861
Da una famiglia adottiva all'altra

30
00:01:15,911 --> 00:01:18,158
e tutto quel che volevo
era una vita normale.

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,604
la tua vita e' seriamente in pericolo,
e devi venire con me adesso.

32
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,037
Posso proteggerti.
Posso nasconderti.

33
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:23,709
perche' non te ne torni in paradiso

34
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,507
e mi lasci da solo all'inferno?

35
00:01:25,988 --> 00:01:29,267
You tell us where the Nephilim are,
and we let you live.

36
00:01:29,268 --> 00:01:31,197
Sent killer angels
to my house?

37
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,361
What about my family?

38
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:34,659
Well, they're not
your family anyway.

39
00:01:34,842 --> 00:01:38,269
If you forsake your powers,
You can save the life
you have here.

40
00:01:38,402 --> 00:01:41,398
If not, you will become
what you were born to be...

41
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,395
the Redeemer.

42
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:45,806
When God created man,

43
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,869
a jealous Lucifer mounted
a great rebellion in Heaven.

44
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,033
His army of angels
was defeated

45
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,096
and forever banished
from paradise.

46
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,342
These angels, the Fallen,

47
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:57,922
abandoned Lucifer,
choosing to live on Earth

48
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,519
among the pleasures of humans.

49
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:02,931
They took mortal wives
and fathered abominations,

50
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,754
children called Nephilim.

51
00:02:05,003 --> 00:02:07,883
They have the powers
of angels
but the souls of men.

52
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,396
Angry, the Creator
flooded the Earth,

53
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:13,575
killing the Nephilim
and driving the Fallen
into hiding.

54
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,474
He sent the Powers,
fierce warrior angels,

55
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:18,471
to hunt those
that survived the flood.

56
00:02:20,052 --> 00:02:22,332
But there was hope
for the Fallen in a prophecy.

57
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:24,229
A Nephilim would be born

58
00:02:24,396 --> 00:02:26,641
who would redeem them
and return them to paradise.

59
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:30,103
So the Fallen watched...
and waited.

60
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,631
Sometimes I...

61
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,642
wonder what it would be like
if Lucifer had won|the war.

62
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:52,089
I mean, it's not like
he got us on his side

63
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,555
with promises of an evil empire
and

64
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,327
eternal suffering.

65
00:02:57,508 --> 00:03:00,471
All that came later...
after the Fall.

66
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,966
I've tried my best
to make up
for what I've done.

67
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:07,077
To help the humans
defend themselves

68
00:03:07,078 --> 00:03:09,207
against what I helped to create.
But...

69
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:13,227
I mean, there's just
as much hate in the world,
just as much suffering.

70
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:17,197
More, even.
So have I atoned
for what I have done?

71
00:03:19,444 --> 00:03:20,609
I don't know.

72
00:03:26,181 --> 00:03:27,945
I just know
I wanna go home.

73
00:03:48,114 --> 00:03:49,978
Then that's where you'll go.

74
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,012
It's been one year since I found out
that I have the power

75
00:04:34,013 --> 00:04:36,283
to send Fallen angels
back to Heaven.

76
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,910
But the Powers can sense
every redemption.

77
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:44,170
And we always risk
the possibility of an attack.

78
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,000
So we never stop running.

79
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:53,559
So many Fallen...

80
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:56,954
yet to be redeemed.

81
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,096
Be patient.

82
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:24,790
Stay here.

83
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,869
I'm fighting with you this time.
No, you're not.

84
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,301
I'm not gonna just sit here.

85
00:05:49,681 --> 00:05:50,496
Aaron!

86
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:03,139
Most Nephilim
don't put up a fight.

87
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:05,103
Well, I'm not like
most Nephilim.

88
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,387
You'll die like them,|though.

89
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,101
I don't know what just happened to me.
I told you to stay in the car.

90
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:30,065
It's like I almost
wasn't even there.

91
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,525
I remember fighting, but it's
like remembering a dream.

92
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,279
I felt like I could take on
the Powers all by myself.

93
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,372
- I almost felt like I was invincible.
- You are far from it.

94
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:44,749
When you lose control like that,
you are losing the very thing

95
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,564
that gives you the advantage
over your opponent.

96
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:50,657
You are as powerful
as any angel there is,|Aaron.

97
00:06:50,773 --> 00:06:53,120
But your humanity
makes you stronger.

98
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:56,859
In time, you will learn
to master this duality,

99
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,070
but until then you will focus
on returning the Fallen|to Heaven,

100
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,285
and you will leave
the fighting to me.

101
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:05,764
If I hadn't fought,
you'd be dead right now,|Camael.

102
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,865
Your journey...
has just begun.

103
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,374
You must be patient.

104
00:07:31,695 --> 00:07:32,910
You all right?

105
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,254
I could heal you.

106
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:38,284
He did heal me,|Camael.

107
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:44,492
A wound...
caused by angelfire is much different.

108
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,553
You cannot heal it.

109
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,297
What are we
gonna do, then?

110
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,526
Find someone who can.

111
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:29,899
She's gone, Ariel.

112
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,321
Get the paddles, Clarence.

113
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:36,919
Get the paddles.

114
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,727
Nobody dies on my watch.

115
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,043
Welcome back.

116
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:12,828
Drop me off here.

117
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:16,594
This may take some time.

118
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,643
Camael.

119
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:26,126
Could we check out|the school?

120
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:29,387
Fine.
But stay close.

121
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:33,730
And that's the long history of division,
as nation after nation suffered the effects...

122
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,912
Aaron, this is bigger
than your old school.

123
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,715
Well, this is college.
It's different.

124
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:42,583
...and every freethinking
individual is a lost prophet.

125
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:45,292
And every poetic prophecy
is a conscious conspiracy

126
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,838
to emancipate ourselves
from mental slavery.

127
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,772
And we will get free or die.

128
00:09:51,506 --> 00:09:53,371
Because the numbers
don't lie.

129
00:09:54,638 --> 00:09:56,538
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:00,381
I wasn't even watching where I was going.
No, I wasn't watching where I was going.

131
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,179
Hi.

132
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,135
Paradise Lost.
I know, it, uh...

133
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,191
Yawn.

134
00:10:09,056 --> 00:10:11,554
So, uh,
what's your major?

135
00:10:12,352 --> 00:10:14,053
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't, uh...

136
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:16,270
I don't... I don't go
to school here.

137
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:18,530
Uh, just...
just visiting.

138
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:19,797
Yeah.

139
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:21,802
Right.

140
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,929
Looks pretty cool,|though.

141
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,412
Yeah, it's okay.

142
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,848
- I'm Chloe.
- Aaron.

143
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,251
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

144
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,919
Excuse me,
is there something
I can help you with?

145
00:10:40,165 --> 00:10:42,253
Hey, you're not supposed|to be in here.

146
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:44,517
He's right...

147
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,645
you're notsupposed to be here.

148
00:10:48,454 --> 00:10:50,507
- Ariel.
- Punisher.

149
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:51,767
Punisher?

150
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:54,242
Yeah, that's what we called
him in high school.

151
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:56,389
Linebacker.

152
00:11:04,584 --> 00:11:06,579
Wow. This is great.

153
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,641
What's it like,
going to college?

154
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,058
I don't know.
It's pretty fun,|I guess.

155
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:13,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

156
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,679
I mean, it's true what they say,
you know.

157
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,655
Being away from your parents
in a different environment,

158
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:21,673
you really do learn
a lot about yourself.

159
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,230
What have you learned?

160
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,444
that I like partying
almost as much as I hate hangovers.

161
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,937
Uh, how come
you don't go?

162
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,784
I... I want to.|I do.

163
00:11:40,403 --> 00:11:41,857
I guess I just...

164
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,587
I got a lot going on|in my...
in my life right now.

165
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,828
Well, if you're interested,
you can come to class with me.

166
00:11:52,004 --> 00:11:53,482
Help me stay awake.

167
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:54,667
You can do that?

168
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:57,232
Well, they won't let any random
person come in off the street,

169
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,836
but if you're accompanied
by an actual student...

170
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,112
I suppose I could vouch
for you.

171
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,141
Thanks.

172
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,520
Well, I'd love to
i'd do something like that.

173
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:10,549
I would, um...
I just, uh...

174
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,708
I don't know|if I can.

175
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Why not?
You need Gabe's permission or something?

176
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,197
I like her, Aaron.

177
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:20,541
Come on, 9:00 tomorrow
in that building right over there.

178
00:12:21,796 --> 00:12:22,898
I'm gonna meet you|out front.

179
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,472
I'll see you there.

180
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:02,995
Hello?

181
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:05,681
Who's there?

182
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,906
Don't tell me it's judgment day already.

183
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:18,199
I was just getting comfortable.

184
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,226
No, Azazel.

185
00:13:21,517 --> 00:13:22,490
Not yet.

186
00:13:23,323 --> 00:13:26,701
But soon.
Before you know it,

187
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,677
Gabriel's horn
will sound,

188
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:34,745
and you will be cast
into the fires of Hell for all eternity.

189
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:39,956
I doubt you'll find that
environment any more hospitable.

190
00:13:43,715 --> 00:13:45,967
Well, at least it will be
a change of scenery.

191
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,909
What...

192
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:54,463
is this language
we're speaking?

193
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,516
It's called English.

194
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,294
It's been very popular|on Earth
for quite some time.

195
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,165
How long have
I been here?

196
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:06,870
5,000 years.

197
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,037
Give or take a century.

198
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:12,395
I'm curious.

199
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:16,471
Did you think more time had passed,
or less?

200
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:20,098
What do you want?

201
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:26,116
To give you...
what you desire most.

202
00:14:28,462 --> 00:14:29,928
You'd give me my freedom?

203
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,011
If you agree to help me.

204
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,781
It is the time
of the Redeemer, Azazel.

205
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,585
As the prophecy
has foretold,

206
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:46,118
a Nephilim has been born
with the power to return fallen angels to Heaven.

207
00:14:47,044 --> 00:14:51,596
And I need you...
to help him fulfill his destiny.

208
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:54,793
So...

209
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,066
do we have an agreement?

210
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,382
We most certainly do.

211
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:46,742
How are you, Gadreel?

212
00:15:51,986 --> 00:15:53,534
How did you get out?

213
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,470
Don't concern yourself
with such things.

214
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:04,733
You know, you got to learn
how to blend in.

215
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,862
That's how I stayed alive for so long.

216
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:10,677
Fine, but there's something
I should rather do first.

217
00:16:10,865 --> 00:16:13,712
I'll bet there is.
But you waited 5,000 years.

218
00:16:13,713 --> 00:16:15,929
You can wait
a few more hours.

219
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:17,630
Can you?

220
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:21,368
Thousands have taken to the streets

221
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:24,747
<i>in protests of the arrests of
anti-Russian activists this morning.</i>

222
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:27,640
<i>Cars were set on fire
and storefronts smashed,</i>

223
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,661
<i>as an angry mob stormed the Russian embassy
in the capital of Rome.</i>

224
00:16:30,662 --> 00:16:32,490
So who is
this woman, anyway?

225
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,913
<i>Over in the Middle East
oil fires were still burning...</i>

226
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:36,825
Ariel took over
the underground

227
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:39,500
after the death
of Samchial last year.

228
00:16:40,706 --> 00:16:44,577
She's the one who has been giving me
the locations of those you have redeemed.

229
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,313
She's in charge
of the Fallen?

230
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,248
Yes.

231
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:54,942
Aaron.

232
00:16:59,412 --> 00:17:01,522
It is so good
to finally meet you.

233
00:17:02,414 --> 00:17:05,393
God, I feel like I already know you.
Camael's told me so much about you.

234
00:17:06,144 --> 00:17:07,775
He did not tell me how good-looking
you were, though.

235
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,382
You didn't tell me how cute he was.

236
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,470
I'm not exactly his type.

237
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,184
What?

238
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,808
It's just... Usually when I'm
around the Fallen, I get this...

239
00:17:22,729 --> 00:17:24,359
weird feeling.

240
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,840
Um, it's how I know
they need redemption.

241
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:33,096
I don't feel that need
from you.

242
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:41,777
You're picking up
on their desire|for forgiveness,

243
00:17:43,093 --> 00:17:44,818
their beliefs
that they're ready.

244
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:50,108
You know, and whether they're worthy
of redemption or not is a whole other story.

245
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:53,360
But you're not picking it up from me,
because it's not my time yet.

246
00:17:55,113 --> 00:17:57,412
I'll be the last Fallen
you'll redeem, Aaron.

247
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:01,502
Comes with the gig.

248
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:06,159
Welcome.
There's a bedroom for you upstairs.

249
00:18:11,489 --> 00:18:12,697
Come on, Gabe,

250
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:25,268
The Nephilim
has escaped us again.

251
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:29,257
You have disgraced us
with your incompetence.

252
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,211
You're the mightiest angels
on Heaven and Earth.

253
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,179
And you can't dispose
of one simple half-breed.

254
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:39,991
The Nephilim we could handle.
It's Camael that's the problem.

255
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:44,269
Mazarin, the energy signature
that drew us here,

256
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:46,755
there's something different
about it.

257
00:18:47,412 --> 00:18:49,301
What if the traitor
is right?

258
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:53,031
What is this Nephilim he's been dragging
all over the country really is the Redeemer?

259
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,661
There is no Reedemer,|Sachael.

260
00:18:57,324 --> 00:18:59,904
It is the Powers' mission
to eradicate all of the Nephilim.

261
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,212
This one is no different
from the rest.

262
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,004
Now, when we catch up
with the little bastard,
and we will,

263
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,370
the prophecy will become
a dead issue.

264
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,040
You've been killing a lot
of your old friends lately.

265
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,008
I take no pleasure in it.

266
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:22,719
Yeah, that's what you used to say
when you used to kill us Fallen.

267
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:25,135
It was true then, as well.

268
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:28,537
So how's he doing?

269
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:32,159
He's struggling.

270
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:36,722
His angelic and human desires
are at constant odds.

271
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:42,012
Yeah, well...
all Nephilim are like that the first few years.

272
00:19:42,994 --> 00:19:44,308
It'll get better.

273
00:19:44,871 --> 00:19:46,231
It's getting worse.

274
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,132
Maybe you're just
working him too hard.

275
00:20:04,392 --> 00:20:05,834
You're new here,|ain'tcha?

276
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,546
Er... Yeah.

277
00:20:08,344 --> 00:20:12,109
Then he went out back
with Gina for, like, 15 minutes.

278
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,235
Gina?

279
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,171
The barmaid.

280
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,763
He doesn't
even know her name.

281
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:20,405
Damn, man.

282
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:24,288
You're all right.
What's with the threads,|though?

283
00:20:24,546 --> 00:20:25,438
Threads?

284
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:28,279
Oh, you mean my clothes.

285
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,566
I like the way you talk.

286
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:32,865
- The way I what?
- The way I what?

287
00:20:33,264 --> 00:20:35,505
So, you're
a gambling man, huh?

288
00:20:44,707 --> 00:20:46,068
You up for a game?

289
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,914
So how does one
play this game?

290
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:54,937
Hold your horses, chief.
We only play for money.

291
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:56,931
I have neither money
nor horses.

292
00:20:57,412 --> 00:21:00,294
- But I'll wager you a night with Gina...
- We could do that.

293
00:21:00,822 --> 00:21:02,464
for your mode
of transportation.

294
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,118
My bike?

295
00:21:08,161 --> 00:21:09,792
Okay, here.

296
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:10,832
I smell a fight.

297
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:14,234
You better come through
once you lose.

298
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:18,315
Teach him
some manners, buddy!

299
00:21:20,852 --> 00:21:22,154
It's goin' down.

300
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:38,722
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

301
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:41,084
Wait a minute now!

302
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,984
You don't mean
my bike, man!

303
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,412
We had a deal,
didn't we...

304
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,101
man?

305
00:21:47,911 --> 00:21:51,446
You want my bike?
Come take it.

306
00:22:29,814 --> 00:22:30,866
Bad dreams again?

307
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:32,771
You ever have nightmares?

308
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:34,585
Sometimes.

309
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,242
You know how to stop them?

310
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,466
All you have to do is wake up.

311
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:49,446
Morning.

312
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:50,581
Good morning.

313
00:23:05,946 --> 00:23:07,287
I've never seen
him sleep before.

314
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:08,813
He's not sleeping.

315
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:10,442
He's healing.

316
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:13,164
Angelfire wounds
can be bad news.

317
00:23:13,947 --> 00:23:15,948
In time,
even a little nick
would have killed him.

318
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:17,639
Don't worry.

319
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,682
By tonight,
he'll be good as new.

320
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:31,478
Mmm, I love waffles.

321
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:35,252
Thanks.

322
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:47,116
I haven't had a...
real breakfast
in what seems like forever.

323
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,436
You miss
your parents, huh?

324
00:23:51,756 --> 00:23:53,818
I just haven't seen them
in a really long time.

325
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,382
I wish there was
a way I could...

326
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,114
get a hold of them|and just
tell them that
I'm okay, you know?

327
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:00,960
I know.

328
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:03,640
But it's safer
for them this way.

329
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:13,209
Do you know who
my real father
and mother are?

330
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:17,869
The Fallen don't
exactly advertise it
when one of them
becomes a daddy.

331
00:24:18,344 --> 00:24:20,179
It's a good way
to get the Powers
all over your ass.

332
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,107
Yeah.

333
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,334
Camael pretty much
said the same thing.

334
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:26,407
Yeah.

335
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:31,954
Hey, um...
Do you think it would
be all right if I...

336
00:24:32,924 --> 00:24:34,904
went by the, uh,|college
and, uh,

337
00:24:35,398 --> 00:24:37,894
just checked out
a couple of the classes?

338
00:24:38,162 --> 00:24:40,801
Well, you're a big boy.
You don't need
my permission.

339
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,018
It's just that Camael
never lets me

340
00:24:43,557 --> 00:24:46,317
go anywhere
or do anything.

341
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,373
You're in Ariel's house now.
And I say you can do
whatever you want.

342
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:53,777
Just no angel stuff.

343
00:24:55,721 --> 00:25:00,824
Angels.
Warring amongst themselves
because of mankind.

344
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:06,182
Lucifer's ambition
sprang from envy
that angels

345
00:25:06,183 --> 00:25:09,443
were no longer God's
favorite creation.

346
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,270
At the beginning
of Milton's epic,

347
00:25:13,228 --> 00:25:15,609
he has suffered
a crushing defeat.

348
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:18,107
Lucifer and his followers

349
00:25:19,198 --> 00:25:21,943
had been banished
from Heaven forever.

350
00:25:23,515 --> 00:25:26,787
We see him struggling
with self-doubt.

351
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,908
We see he has hopes|and fears,

352
00:25:31,327 --> 00:25:32,406
just like us.

353
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,765
We identify with him.

354
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,322
Yes?

355
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,700
So, the devil...
he's a good guy?

356
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:47,840
Well...
he's certainly sympathetic.

357
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:51,758
Lucifer sees himself|as a victim.

358
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:56,634
And it's fair to question
whether the Rebellion

359
00:25:57,232 --> 00:26:01,642
was his design,
or pre-ordained destiny.

360
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:02,921
Wait a second.

361
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:07,092
Are you saying that Lucifer was

362
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,848
created to rebel?

363
00:26:10,857 --> 00:26:12,218
Is that so hard to believe?

364
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,886
What is good without evil?

365
00:26:18,114 --> 00:26:19,698
Does doing the right thing

366
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:22,826
have any meaning

367
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:25,888
if there is
no alternative?

368
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:28,773
But that doesn't make
any sense.

369
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:34,072
Even if Lucifer
was destined to become
the epitome of evil,

370
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:39,363
he made the choice
to follow that path.

371
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:56,452
o/~ It's never gonna be o/~

372
00:26:57,109 --> 00:26:59,725

374
00:27:05,704 --> 00:27:08,719
You have no idea
how much I miss you,|Azazel.

375
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,283
I'm so glad
you got back.

376
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:13,503
I know.

377
00:27:17,652 --> 00:27:19,904
Well, gotta go.

378
00:27:25,097 --> 00:27:26,270
What do you mean,
you gotta go?

379
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,393
- You just got here.
- Yep.

380
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,041
I've got something
I need to take care of.

381
00:27:32,354 --> 00:27:33,515
What things?

382
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:35,639
The Redeemer's arrived.

383
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,877
Ariel contacted me
a few months ago.

384
00:27:48,979 --> 00:27:50,012
Really?

385
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,299
Where is she?

386
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:58,192
Where is she?

387
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:08,439
She lives in this college town
200 miles from here.

388
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,035
Good, then that's
where I'm going.

389
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,712
You know,
your speech has improved,
but your clothes suck.

390
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:17,413
You need real ones.

391
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,791
Angelic robes aren't
as stylish
as they used to be.

392
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:24,556
I'm sure I'll find you
something that fits.

393
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:32,233
Whose are these?

394
00:28:33,394 --> 00:28:36,116
I don't know.
An old boyfriend.
Or a husband, maybe.

395
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:38,908
You've been locked up
for 5,000 years.

396
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:40,797
I have my needs.

397
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:44,867
It's not like fidelity
was ever your strong suit.

398
00:28:48,738 --> 00:28:49,969
Oh, wow, okay.

399
00:28:51,858 --> 00:28:54,333
Thanks for letting me
sit in, though.
That was really cool.

400
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,515
It's not a problem.

401
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:59,174
- I don't know, I just kind of thought you might like
to sit in on it.
- |Hey, um...

402
00:28:59,297 --> 00:29:02,311
I don't mean to be rude.
Can I just...
Can I catch up with you in,
like, one second?

403
00:29:02,312 --> 00:29:03,270
- Of course.|
- Sorry.

404
00:29:06,472 --> 00:29:07,235
Excuse me.

405
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:12,502
I just wanted to apologize
for talking out of turn
back there.

406
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:18,198
Not at all.
I admire your passion
on the subject,
Mr. Corbett.

407
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,770
- Correct?
- Yes. Yes.

408
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:23,430
Um, and thank you
for letting me sit in
on your class, Dr. Grasic.

409
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:27,359
So...
are you a religious zealot,

410
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,479
or just a die-hard
Milton fan?

411
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,787
Uh, neither.
Um, I've actually

412
00:29:33,788 --> 00:29:36,677
- never read Paradise Lost.
- Shame on you.

413
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:40,161
Anyway, I was thinking about

414
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,208
what you said about Lucifer
and his destiny,
and it goes against...

415
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:47,353
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I have
no time.

416
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:51,998
But I spend
most of my evenings
at the library.

417
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:56,340
If you'd like to come by,
I'd be happy to continue
our discussion.

418
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:12,839
Hi.

419
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:15,889
Come here.

420
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:24,779
- How was work?
- It was great.

421
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,110
I didn't even have
to use my healing magic
on anyone today.

422
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:30,749
You use your healing magic
on the job?

423
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:35,086
- Aren't you worried about the Powers?
- Oh, I'm always worried about the Powers.

424
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:39,344
But if I have a chance
at saving a life, to me it's worth it.

425
00:30:40,244 --> 00:30:42,590
Besides,
I got a few tricks
up my sleeve.

426
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:49,461
It's a protective rune.

427
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,921
It's not strong enough
to mask a redemption
but

428
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:54,997
it's good for
a little interference.

429
00:30:55,384 --> 00:30:56,862
You know, in a pinch.

430
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,425
Keep it.
I've got dozens of them.

431
00:31:01,797 --> 00:31:02,079
Thanks.

432
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:12,279
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

433
00:31:12,995 --> 00:31:13,816
What do you mean?

434
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,300
By redeeming the Fallen?

435
00:31:20,385 --> 00:31:21,206
I don't know.

436
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,162
What do you think?

437
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:25,915
I don't know.

438
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,805
Camael's always drilled it|into my head
that it's my destiny.

439
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:36,618
But just because
I'm meant to do something,
does that

440
00:31:37,626 --> 00:31:38,999
make it
the right thing to do?

441
00:31:42,742 --> 00:31:48,349
What if the Earth...
I don't know,
needs angels?

442
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:53,061
And I'm just...
taking them away?

443
00:31:56,111 --> 00:31:56,698
Aaron...

444
00:31:58,938 --> 00:32:00,252
this is your mission.

445
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,829
Now, whether
it's right or wrong
is for you to decide.

446
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:07,700
And I think,
until you know,

447
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,793
you should keep your gift
to yourself.

448
00:32:11,438 --> 00:32:13,819
Because what you're doing
is far too important.

449
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:16,330
You have to believe|in it.

450
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,888
That's my two cents.

451
00:32:27,393 --> 00:32:28,460
See your I.D.?

452
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,284
- Can you hold these?
- Yeah.

453
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:35,164
There you go.

454
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:37,357
- You got that?
- Yeah.

455
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,720
- You're 21?
- No, but my sister is.

456
00:32:44,415 --> 00:32:45,846
One for you. Yep.

457
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:48,451
There you go.|Okay.
You guys ready?

458
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:52,663
Yeah!
Okay, let's do this!|Woo!
Yep!
Cheers.
Cheers.

459
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,033
Yo, aren't you drinking?

460
00:33:01,678 --> 00:33:03,273
I'm not really much
of a drinker.

461
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,651
He's the designated driver.

462
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:09,173
Didn't you guys|walk here?
Yeah.

463
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,613
Don't you guys
have classes
in the morning?

464
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,977
Does that make
any difference? Class?|Class?

465
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:22,201
You guys...
Take one drink!
It's right there!|Come on!

466
00:33:22,202 --> 00:33:25,154
One shot won't hurt you.|Man up.
You can't waste|alcohol, man. Man up.

467
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:27,301
Drink it.
Do it! Woo!
Leave it.
Yeah!

468
00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:30,598
Just one shot!
He's got it|right there.
One shot. One shot.

469
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,042
Ooh, you're not
gonna puke, are you?

470
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,001
Okay, we're gonna
grab some air.

471
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:52,384
Ten bucks says
we don't see
either one of them
again tonight.

472
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,745
So, how was
your first day
of college?

473
00:33:58,316 --> 00:34:00,885
It was great.
Thanks.

474
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,133
- Chloe.
- What is it?

475
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:33,585
Just...

476
00:34:35,568 --> 00:34:37,398
You don't want
to get involved with me.

477
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:40,268
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

478
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:46,649
- Nothing.
- Then is something wrong with me?

479
00:34:48,103 --> 00:34:50,766
'Cause I've been
practically throwing
myself at you all day.

480
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:19,049
Aaron!

481
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:25,427
No!

482
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,778
Wait, dude. Chill.

483
00:35:35,779 --> 00:35:37,620
We were just
messing around.

484
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:40,271

Oh, Mr. Corbett.

495
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:10,401
- I wasn't sure
you'd still be here.
- The library doesn't close
until midnight.

496
00:37:11,652 --> 00:37:14,596
The staff always
has to chase me out.

497
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:19,793
Yeah.

498
00:37:21,514 --> 00:37:23,215
What can you tell me
about the Nephilim?

499
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:36,175
It's widely accepted
that the Nephilim
were killed
in the Great Flood.

500
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,230
They were powerful beings,

501
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,738
very often portrayed
as giants.
Monsters.

502
00:37:45,212 --> 00:37:50,115
Have you ever...
heard of a Nephilim
called the Redeemer?

503
00:37:54,127 --> 00:37:54,796
I have.

504
00:37:57,207 --> 00:37:59,717
I'm surprised that
you know of him, though.

505
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:06,474
It's quite
an obscure prophecy.
Very controversial.

506
00:38:10,308 --> 00:38:12,866
The Redeemer was a vehicle
for forgiveness.

507
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:19,861
He or she has the power
to pardon anyone
of any sin,

508
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,984
no matter how great.

509
00:38:24,832 --> 00:38:29,207
But there are clues
to something else
in the prophecy,

510
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:36,043
hints that he may serve
another, darker purpose.

511
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,895
What purpose?
We don't know.

512
00:38:42,831 --> 00:38:47,664
All we know is
that for every claim
that praises his arrival,

513
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:53,147
there is another
that speaks of it
in terror.

514
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:58,437
We are not even sure
if he is a force of good...

515
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,961
or evil.

516
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:20,248
Aaron.

517
00:39:24,188 --> 00:39:24,716
Ariel.

518
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,036
How you feeling?

519
00:39:34,822 --> 00:39:36,793
Much better. Thank you.

520
00:39:38,165 --> 00:39:42,799
I'm glad you're up.
I got called in to work,
and somebody's
gotta walk Gabriel.

521
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,750
Oh, and I promised him
some ice cream.

522
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,248
Where's Aaron?

523
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:52,439
He's hanging with
his friends from college.

524
00:39:52,987 --> 00:39:54,489
His friends?
Mm-hmm.

525
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:58,348
How long have I been out?

526
00:39:59,122 --> 00:40:03,110
Don't worry.
He's fine.
You can't protect him
all the time, you know?

527
00:40:03,764 --> 00:40:05,911
Yes, I can.
I must.

528
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:10,005
- He's an irresponsible child. And that temper will get someone...
- He's 19,

529
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:13,160
he's a good kid,
and he needs some normalcy
in his life.

530
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:16,596
You gotta remember,
he's human.

531
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,901
Half human.
That's more than you are.

532
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,660
Who are you to talk?

533
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:31,205
The Nephilim are monsters.

534
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:34,301
Why?

535
00:40:35,987 --> 00:40:36,761
What did they do?

536
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:42,040
What is that?

537
00:40:46,043 --> 00:40:47,040
It's nothing.

538
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:49,867
Where did you get it?

539
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:52,988
My friend gave it to me.

540
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,391
What are you doing?
I know what this is.

541
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:04,010
Protective rune
used to hide yourself.

542
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,151
To hide yourself?
I don't know what
you're talking about.

543
00:41:07,503 --> 00:41:11,033
You hide yourself|from angels.

544
00:41:16,095 --> 00:41:20,142
Yes.
It all makes sense now.

545
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,793
I don't know what
you're talking about.

546
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:27,821
Of course you don't.
You never know
who might be listening.

547
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,411
But I know what you are.

548
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:38,983
And I'm just like you.
We are brothers, Aaron.

549
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:41,587
Brothers in the Order.

550
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:46,158
The Order?
Yeah.

551
00:41:47,566 --> 00:41:49,466
I know why you're here.

552
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:52,669
You do?|Yes.

553
00:41:53,682 --> 00:41:58,445
We both know that
the angels are real.

554
00:41:59,204 --> 00:42:04,600
We know that
they walk among us.

555
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:13,974
Tell me...
would you like to see one?

556
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:16,449
Yes?

557
00:42:25,995 --> 00:42:27,637
All this
on a teacher's salary?

558
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:33,804
My family
has a long history
of dealing
in ancient artifacts.

559
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,570
What I'm about|to show you,

560
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:48,277
you can never
breathe a word about,
for your own safety.

561
00:42:53,744 --> 00:42:55,715
You have nothing
to fear from me.

562
00:42:56,618 --> 00:43:00,864
But as I'm sure|you know,
some of our members

563
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:02,648
are overly cautious.

564
00:43:06,601 --> 00:43:08,490
Do I have your word?

565
00:43:12,213 --> 00:43:12,706
Come.

566
00:43:24,915 --> 00:43:28,446
There she is.
Come.

567
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:35,604
Child?

568
00:43:38,384 --> 00:43:39,592
We have a guest.

569
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:43,354
Show us your wings.

570
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,908
Your beautiful wings.

571
00:44:03,789 --> 00:44:07,402
Breathtaking...isn't it?

572
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:15,140
Now turn around.
Show us your pretty face.

573
00:44:32,454 --> 00:44:34,413
Isn't she beautiful?

574
00:44:39,936 --> 00:44:40,772
Vilma!

575
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:45,880
How do you know her name?

576
00:44:45,918 --> 00:44:48,725
That's impossible... what is she doing here?

577
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:51,894
She's quite comfortable here.

578
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,312
I've taken excellent care.

579
00:44:54,857 --> 00:44:56,019
She's a prisoner.

580
00:44:57,621 --> 00:45:00,137
She's the only living Nephilim.

581
00:45:02,396 --> 00:45:03,891
Would you rather her

582
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,435
be strapped to a table in a laboratory somewhere?

583
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:11,008
I'm taking her out of here.

584
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:12,348
No.

585
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:15,205
You'll do no such thing

586
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:25,164
It's time for you to leave my house.

587
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,289
Right now.

588
00:45:33,628 --> 00:45:34,294
Lukas...

589
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,002
God!

590
00:45:41,624 --> 00:45:43,290
Those markings.

591
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,168
Wipe away those runes.

592
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:07,930
I don't want to.

593
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:08,663
Do it.

594
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:13,747
Do it now!

595
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:34,808
You are... the Redeemer.

596
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:37,378
Wipe away those runes.

597
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:40,265
Do it!

598
00:46:50,194 --> 00:46:50,690
Vilma.

599
00:46:52,822 --> 00:46:53,421
It's me.

600
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:57,808
Vilma, it's Aaron.

601
00:46:58,911 --> 00:47:00,192
We're going to get out of here.

602
00:47:11,178 --> 00:47:12,166
It's okay.

603
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:13,395
You're safe now.

604
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:15,147
I promise.

605
00:48:09,032 --> 00:48:09,654
You all right?

606
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,488
Yeah.

607
00:48:11,621 --> 00:48:12,902
Vilma, say something, please.

608
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:15,913
You're like me.

609
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:18,363
How is that possible?

610
00:48:18,992 --> 00:48:19,562
I don't know.

611
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:21,101
I don't know what the hell's going on.

612
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:22,293
Aaron!

613
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:26,853
Camael. It's okay.

614
00:48:27,775 --> 00:48:29,255
This is Camael.
He's my friend.

615
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,758
Hey! I rember you.

616
00:48:30,795 --> 00:48:31,853
This girl is Nephilim.

617
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:33,659
Where did she come from?

618
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:36,339
It's a long story.

619
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,960
You lost control.

620
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:41,800
The Powers are coming.
You must leave now.

621
00:48:42,126 --> 00:48:45,257
No. I'm going to stay,
and I'm going to fight.

622
00:48:45,745 --> 00:48:49,032
If you don't leave now,
they will kill all of us.

623
00:48:49,624 --> 00:48:51,097
And if I do, they'll kill you?

624
00:48:52,294 --> 00:48:54,359
I have pledged to lay down my life for you.

625
00:48:54,863 --> 00:48:56,173
That is what I intend to do.

626
00:48:56,454 --> 00:48:57,498
What is going on?

627
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,007
Aaron, you must protect
this child, as you once
need my help.

628
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,227
Run!

629
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:13,615
Take care of the traitor.

630
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:15,392
I'm going after the Nephilim.

631
00:49:56,083 --> 00:49:57,356
Well, I'll be damned.

632
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,006
Two for the price of one.
It must be my lucky day.

633
00:50:02,012 --> 00:50:03,219
I got to admit, kid.

634
00:50:03,915 --> 00:50:05,521
You gave us a run for our money.

635
00:50:09,027 --> 00:50:10,219
But this is how it ends.

636
00:50:15,001 --> 00:50:16,963
Leave the children alone, Nathaniel.

637
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:19,169
Azazel.

638
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,045
Don't you have some puppies to go kick or something?

639
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:27,644
This can't be you.
This isn't real.

640
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,174
Oh, it's real.

641
00:50:31,225 --> 00:50:33,719
What could I possibly do to convince you?

642
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,968
Oh. Aren't I?

643
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:57,683
You guys all right?

644
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:01,690
What, are you scared of me?

645
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:03,748
I just saved your asses.

646
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:39,736
Who are you?

647
00:51:40,195 --> 00:51:41,142
I'm Azazel.

648
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:43,289
Glad to meet you.

649
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,367
Are you one of the Fallen?

650
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,025
I'm Azazel.

651
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,128
You never heard of me?

652
00:51:51,618 --> 00:51:53,417
Yeah, I'm one of the Fallen.
I'm the Fallen.

653
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:57,808
Your girl looks a little
freaked out, man.

654
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:01,034
Yeah, well,
it's been a rough night.

655
00:52:01,721 --> 00:52:03,920
Yeah, well you know what?
It's only going to get worse.

656
00:52:04,018 --> 00:52:06,372
We need to get off these streets,
go underground. Let's go.

657
00:52:09,368 --> 00:52:13,299
Let's go! They can smell you.
They can feel you. Come on.

658
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:15,531
We got to go.

659
00:52:15,686 --> 00:52:18,572
Aaron. He just killed that man.

660
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:20,874
Vilma, I know what you're
going through right now.

661
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,466
But he's one of the Fallen.
He's on our side.

662
00:52:23,577 --> 00:52:24,576
On our side?

663
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:27,674
Whose side are we on?
Are we the good guys
or the bad guys?

664
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:33,650
If we survive this night, I promise you
I will tell you everything I know.

665
00:52:34,675 --> 00:52:35,874
But right now,
we've got to go.

666
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:37,343
Okay?

667
00:52:38,942 --> 00:52:39,801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

668
00:52:59,141 --> 00:53:00,355
Hey, could I ask
you something?

669
00:53:03,439 --> 00:53:06,762
How did you end up
in that nutjob's attic?

670
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:12,288
Well, it all started
on my 18th birthday.

671
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,423
Strange things started
happening to me.

672
00:53:17,432 --> 00:53:18,891
I was getting these headaches,

673
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:21,177
and I was hearing voices.

674
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,366
And then...
And the angels came.

675
00:53:27,813 --> 00:53:30,248
They're so majestic
at first, you know.

676
00:53:30,752 --> 00:53:31,825
So beautiful.

677
00:53:32,836 --> 00:53:34,494
Real angels from Heaven.

678
00:53:37,357 --> 00:53:38,245
Then they attacked.

679
00:53:41,376 --> 00:53:42,649
They killed my aunt.

680
00:53:44,075 --> 00:53:45,008
Burned down the house.

681
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:47,710
Somehow, I got away.

682
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:50,384
The angels who did that
to you,

683
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:52,709
they're calledthe Powers.

684
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:56,173
They are the same angels

685
00:53:57,305 --> 00:53:59,704
that are chasing us right now.

686
00:54:00,192 --> 00:54:02,368
I just ran.
Hid in the woods.

687
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:05,441
I thought I was dead,
for sure.

688
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:09,749
I stopped this man in the woods
and asked him for help, but...

689
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:13,502
he pulled out a gun
and shot me with a tranquilizer.

690
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:17,552
Lukas didn't hurt me or
anything, though, he, uh...

691
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,862
He was kind.

692
00:54:21,776 --> 00:54:25,035
You probably won't understand.
It's not like I had anywhere else to go.

693
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,527
Until you came.

694
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,516
So, thanks for coming
to my rescue.

695
00:54:36,181 --> 00:54:38,795
Maybe you can tell me now why angels
are trying to kill us?

696
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:40,021
What did we do?

697
00:54:41,057 --> 00:54:43,002
It's because we were
born Nephilim.

698
00:54:44,392 --> 00:54:47,752
They're on a mission from
the Creator to cleanse
the Earth of...

699
00:54:48,143 --> 00:54:51,162
our kind.
We're abominations.

700
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:54,009
Abominations.

701
00:54:54,337 --> 00:54:58,000
Yeah, you're freaks. It sucks.
Can we all stop feeling sorry for ourselves now?

702
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,226
We're alive,

703
00:55:00,236 --> 00:55:01,929
which is more than can
be said for Nathaniel.

704
00:55:02,037 --> 00:55:03,616
Hey, listen. Um...

705
00:55:04,425 --> 00:55:06,774
I want to thank you
for what you did back there.

706
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,313
If you hadn't shown up,
we might have been...

707
00:55:08,425 --> 00:55:10,369
Hey.
You're the Redeemer.

708
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:12,776
What kind of Fallen would I be
if I didn't look out for you?

709
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:17,561
Hey, we got to find out
what happened to Camael.

710
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,997
Camael? Ah, I wouldn't
worry about him.

711
00:55:22,307 --> 00:55:22,825
What do you mean?

712
00:55:23,836 --> 00:55:24,657
Camael's dead.

713
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:36,252
I can't believe
Camael's dead.

714
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:44,384
What is the big deal?

715
00:55:45,306 --> 00:55:48,211
So Camael's troops finally turned on him.
That's a good thing.

716
00:55:49,765 --> 00:55:51,824
He wasn't with the Powers anymore.
He...

717
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,085
He's been protecting me,

718
00:55:56,944 --> 00:55:58,308
ever since I turned.

719
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:03,209
He was my friend.

720
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:05,015
Your friend?

721
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:07,769
We are talking about
the same Camael, right?

722
00:56:07,802 --> 00:56:09,390
Tall, bald,
no sense of humor?

723
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:20,205
This is all my fault.

724
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,236
No, Aaron,

725
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:25,055
you were trying
to help me.

726
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,480
That's what Camael
would've wanted.

727
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:30,613
I didn't have to
do it like that.

728
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:34,455
I lost control.

729
00:56:38,219 --> 00:56:40,127
And I don't know
what we're going
to do now.

730
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,371
Look, I've got an idea.

731
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,315
Why don't we get
out of town?

732
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:52,829
Lay low for a while.

733
00:56:54,383 --> 00:56:56,214
Somewhere where
the Powers won't find us.

734
00:56:58,033 --> 00:56:58,715
Where is that?

735
00:57:01,248 --> 00:57:03,660
Has anyone ever told you
about the Light Bringer?

736
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,092
It's about time
you met him.

737
00:57:24,702 --> 00:57:27,367
Hey!
Don't move!
Stay right there!

738
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:28,441
Don't move!

739
00:57:30,298 --> 00:57:30,765
Get back here!

740
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:33,001
Come back here and get down on your knees!

741
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,022
Give me your wallet.
Your wallet! All right.

742
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:36,525
Hurry up!
All right!

743
00:57:36,955 --> 00:57:39,519
And your watch.
Your watch, too!
Hurry!
Come on!

744
00:57:58,817 --> 00:58:01,621
It's not nice
to steal from people.

745
00:58:10,978 --> 00:58:11,420
Hey.

746
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:13,972
What is wrong with you?

747
00:58:14,313 --> 00:58:15,551
It's kinda harsh, isn't it?

748
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,833
I'm not a guardian angel.

749
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:22,956
I'm an avenging angel.

750
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:24,977
This is who I am.

751
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:27,680
The world needs both.

752
00:58:29,754 --> 00:58:31,851
Got us a car.
Wanna drive?

753
00:58:34,175 --> 00:58:36,449
We're not seriously going
off with this guy, are we?

754
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:41,287
He can protect us.

755
00:58:42,778 --> 00:58:43,523
We need him.

756
00:58:44,862 --> 00:58:46,175
We need somebody.

757
00:58:48,304 --> 00:58:49,252
Any day now.

758
00:58:55,012 --> 00:58:55,770
Just hold on.

759
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:03,326
What is the Light Bringer?

760
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:05,158
Not what. Who.

761
00:59:05,802 --> 00:59:07,520
He's a fallen angel,
just like me.

762
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:11,077
And his name
is the Light Bringer?

763
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:12,479
Is your name the Redeemer?

764
00:59:13,035 --> 00:59:13,830
Don't be an idiot.

765
00:59:16,015 --> 00:59:18,503
He doesn't have a name
in a traditional sense.

766
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,648
We call him "the Light Bringer"
because that's what he does.

767
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:26,044
He brings us light.
He's an oracle. He's a seer.

768
00:59:27,729 --> 00:59:29,270
Are you sure
that he can help us?

769
00:59:30,673 --> 00:59:32,757
He can't help me,
but he can help you.

770
00:59:33,451 --> 00:59:36,091
Remember that prophecY about you?
The one that foretold your coming?

771
00:59:38,595 --> 00:59:39,378
He wrote it.

772
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,801
You'll find that
quite impossible, traitor.

773
01:00:16,245 --> 01:00:16,978
Aaron?

774
01:00:18,102 --> 01:00:21,626
I suspect we'll have him
or his remains within the hour.

775
01:00:23,003 --> 01:00:25,529
He can't last long
without your protection.

776
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:28,985
Mazarin.

777
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,353
Aaron Corbett is the Redeemer.

778
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,915
The prophecy is real.

779
01:00:38,546 --> 01:00:41,010
No, Camael.
It's a lie.

780
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:45,165
I do hope Nathaniel
brings the boy back alive.

781
01:00:46,352 --> 01:00:48,878
I'd love to make you watch
while I slit his throat

782
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:50,925
so that when you die,

783
01:00:51,683 --> 01:00:54,386
you'll know for certain
that your sacrifice was for nothing.

784
01:00:58,500 --> 01:00:59,485
Mazarin.

785
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:03,679
This is not what
the Powers stand for.

786
01:01:04,576 --> 01:01:07,607
You dare tell me
the Powers' mission?

787
01:01:08,087 --> 01:01:11,195
Are you under the misconception
that you're still one of us?

788
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,212
You turned your back on us, Camael.
You turned your back on the Creator.

789
01:01:16,702 --> 01:01:18,635
And you'll pay
for your sins, traitor.

790
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:26,399
What I want to know is...

791
01:01:28,105 --> 01:01:32,168
what in the hell were you thinking
showing her to anyone?

792
01:01:33,451 --> 01:01:35,105
But he was Nephilim.

793
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:39,653
You didn't know that
when you brought him
up here, did you?

794
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:42,255
I thought
he was one of us.

795
01:01:42,672 --> 01:01:45,716
Oh, right.
Of course.

796
01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:51,741
Because the Order is just teeming
with teenage members, isn't it?

797
01:01:54,094 --> 01:01:55,963
Please, put that down.

798
01:01:57,188 --> 01:01:59,096
It's 4th century.

799
01:01:59,273 --> 01:02:00,485
Really?

800
01:02:01,658 --> 01:02:02,870
It's exquisite.

801
01:02:08,681 --> 01:02:12,066
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that precious to you?

802
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:14,409
What about this?

803
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:20,182
Haven't I lost
enough tonight?

804
01:02:21,862 --> 01:02:24,843
It's not about what you've lost,
Dr. Grasic.

805
01:02:25,626 --> 01:02:28,418
You've lost nothing.
We let you keep her.

806
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,258
She was never yours.He's the Redeemer!

807
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,483
What?

808
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:39,243
Yes.

809
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:49,898
The boy who freed her...

810
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:56,902
he has the markings
of the Redeemer.

811
01:03:09,664 --> 01:03:11,516
Start from the beginning.

812
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:16,968
Is that look in your eye
meant to intimidate me?

813
01:03:19,468 --> 01:03:22,283
Now, I admit there was a time
when it might have,

814
01:03:23,657 --> 01:03:25,379
but those days are over,
old friend.

815
01:03:26,768 --> 01:03:27,564
Mazarin.

816
01:03:28,194 --> 01:03:29,472
What is it, Sachael?

817
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:31,623
It's Nathaniel.

818
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:48,092
He's not coming back.
He's dead.

819
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:52,485
That half-breed
killed Nathaniel?

820
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:54,748
Somebody did.

821
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:09,142
Where is he now, Camael?
Tell me.

822
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:17,544
You know,
over the millennia
we served together,

823
01:04:18,674 --> 01:04:21,618
many of the Fallen
said they would never
give up their children.

824
01:04:22,879 --> 01:04:26,471
But they always did,
thanks to us.

825
01:04:27,786 --> 01:04:29,082
No, thanks to you.

826
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,675
Where is the Nephilim?

827
01:05:03,544 --> 01:05:06,044
So who is this
Jesus character anyway?

828
01:05:09,288 --> 01:05:11,103
Seriously, I've been
seeing his name everywhere.

829
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:22,375
Well, um, a lot of people
think that he was the son of God.

830
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:28,579
What's so funny?

831
01:05:30,986 --> 01:05:32,986
The Creator had a kid.

832
01:05:33,693 --> 01:05:35,638
Well, do as I say,
not as I do, eh?

833
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:38,249
Did you seriously
not know that?

834
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:42,160
Been out of the picture
for a while.

835
01:05:45,586 --> 01:05:46,327
How so?

836
01:05:47,645 --> 01:05:49,886
Well, you probably heard
about what happened
in the old days.

837
01:05:50,275 --> 01:05:53,418
About how the Creator
flooded the planet
because we contaminated

838
01:05:53,432 --> 01:05:55,564
his precious Earth
with half-breeds like you.

839
01:05:56,363 --> 01:05:58,055
A bit of an overreaction,
if you ask me.

840
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,292
But, hey, mysterious ways
and all that.

841
01:06:01,303 --> 01:06:04,515
Wait. You mean,
like, Noah's Ark?

842
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,154
That flood?

843
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:07,717
Yeah, that's right.

844
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,021
Noah.

845
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:13,041
That guy could
really throw it down,
let me tell you.

846
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:15,855
Anyways.

847
01:06:17,493 --> 01:06:20,445
Afterwards, your buddy Camael

848
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,168
and a few other half-wits
from the Powers

849
01:06:23,184 --> 01:06:25,761
decided they were going
to come down and tell us
things had to change.

850
01:06:27,101 --> 01:06:28,343
I guess to prove
a point,

851
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:31,340
they decided to make
an example of someone.

852
01:06:34,174 --> 01:06:35,224
I fought.

853
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:38,700
Killed one of them.

854
01:06:39,712 --> 01:06:42,471
Slashed this son of a bitch
Mazarin across the face.

855
01:06:42,479 --> 01:06:43,830
It was beautiful.

856
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,015
But in the end,

857
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:48,818
they got me.

858
01:06:51,006 --> 01:06:52,859
Took me deep underground,

859
01:06:53,448 --> 01:06:54,455
chained me up,

860
01:06:55,438 --> 01:06:58,483
and left me for 5,000 years.

861
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,407
So you've been a prisoner, too.
Like me.

862
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:04,973
Yeah.

863
01:07:07,441 --> 01:07:09,726
Six months
in a luxury suite...

864
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:13,542
just like being chained
to a stone slab
for five millennia.

865
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:15,186
Just like it.

866
01:07:16,774 --> 01:07:18,474
Don't talk to her
like that.

867
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:19,505
Or what?

868
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,893
I'm just messin'
with you, kid.

869
01:07:27,012 --> 01:07:28,247
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

870
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,943
I'm sure it must've been
very difficult for you.

871
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:33,699
I smell food.

872
01:07:34,088 --> 01:07:34,946
What about food?

873
01:07:35,127 --> 01:07:36,628
Who wants to eat?
Want to stop for a bite?

874
01:07:37,494 --> 01:07:39,033
Well, we're kind of
on the run right now.

875
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:39,725
You gotta eat.

876
01:07:40,758 --> 01:07:42,989
I'm hungry. Who's hungry?
Let's vote.

877
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:44,837
Me! I'm hungry!

878
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:46,189
Me, too.

879
01:07:47,141 --> 01:07:48,211
I'm starving.

880
01:07:49,668 --> 01:07:51,003
Looks like you lose, chief.

881
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,711
All right, order up.

882
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:03,636
Oh... my... God.

883
01:08:08,611 --> 01:08:10,222
What are these things
called again?

884
01:08:11,685 --> 01:08:14,537
What?
French fries?

885
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,300
French fries.
I gotta remember that.

886
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:20,633
Here, try 'em with ketchup.

887
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:37,920
This is the best food
I've ever had
in the history of ever!

888
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:40,624
Hey, we get it.
You like French fries.

889
01:08:43,201 --> 01:08:44,961
This is the first meal
I've had in a long time.

890
01:08:45,035 --> 01:08:48,238
So if you don't mind,
I'm gonna enjoy it.
All right?

891
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,719
And lighten up...
Redeemer.

892
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,811
Why does he keep
calling you that?
Redeemer?

893
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,219
'Cause that's what he is.

894
01:08:59,675 --> 01:09:01,878
He sends us Fallen
back to Heaven.
Show her your arms.

895
01:09:03,804 --> 01:09:05,082
Show her your arms.

896
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:14,756
The names of the Redeemed.

897
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,534
These are all angels?

898
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:23,946
And you send them
back to Heaven?

899
01:09:25,853 --> 01:09:26,798
How?

900
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:29,890
I don't know.

901
01:09:32,431 --> 01:09:36,246
Um... When I'm around them,
I get this, um...

902
01:09:37,527 --> 01:09:39,824
this weird feeling.

903
01:09:40,864 --> 01:09:42,920
It's hard to explain, really.
Um...

904
01:09:44,716 --> 01:09:45,827
I kinda...

905
01:09:47,883 --> 01:09:49,586
open myself up to them.

906
01:09:52,049 --> 01:09:56,123
And then I usually...
take their hand and, uh...

907
01:09:59,016 --> 01:10:01,405
this weird energy
passes between us.

908
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:08,485
And then they're gone.

909
01:10:13,757 --> 01:10:15,517
Wow. Um...

910
01:10:16,609 --> 01:10:17,776
Do it to him.

911
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:21,072
What?
No, you keep that voodoo to yourself.

912
01:10:21,535 --> 01:10:23,035
Don't you want
to go to Heaven?

913
01:10:23,451 --> 01:10:24,210
Hell, no.

914
01:10:24,729 --> 01:10:27,396
If I liked it,
I wouldn't have rebelled
in the first place,
would I?

915
01:10:29,284 --> 01:10:31,618
Yeah, well, I'm not
really doing it anymore.

916
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:34,880
Not right now.

917
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:37,288
Why not?

918
01:10:37,403 --> 01:10:41,069
There's just a lot I...
I still don't understand about it.

919
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,106
Plus, I'm not even sure
if I'm doing the right thing.

920
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:51,332
Aaron, how can sending angels
back to Heaven be wrong?

921
01:10:53,202 --> 01:10:53,999
I don't know.

922
01:10:57,261 --> 01:10:58,909
But I've been having these...

923
01:11:00,706 --> 01:11:02,891
these weird dreams lately

924
01:11:04,528 --> 01:11:05,805
about the end
of the world...

925
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:11,287
and I'm the cause of it.

926
01:11:13,624 --> 01:11:15,735
Damn, kid, you're a mess,
ain't you?

927
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:19,813
Look at me.

928
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:24,965
Look at me.
When we get
to the Light Bringer,

929
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:29,242
I promise you'll understand
yourself and your destiny

930
01:11:29,688 --> 01:11:31,447
a hell of a lot better.

931
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:34,262
More coffee?

932
01:11:36,373 --> 01:11:38,114
Hello, sweetheart.
What's your name?

933
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:41,131
Suzie.

934
01:11:41,946 --> 01:11:45,316
Suzie.
That's such a pretty name.

935
01:11:46,668 --> 01:11:48,334
Saw you looking
at me earlier, Suzie.

936
01:11:49,412 --> 01:11:52,746
No, no. Don't be embarrassed.
Sometimes I can't stop looking at me.

937
01:11:54,635 --> 01:11:56,431
Let me ask you
a question, Suzie.

938
01:11:59,167 --> 01:12:02,075
Is there anywhere near here

939
01:12:03,297 --> 01:12:05,038
where you and I
could go, um...

940
01:12:06,334 --> 01:12:07,112
talk?

941
01:12:14,682 --> 01:12:16,330
I'm going on a break.

942
01:12:16,682 --> 01:12:17,978
Yeah, all right.

943
01:12:20,438 --> 01:12:22,419
Catch you losers later.

944
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:54,623
I've told you
everything I know.

945
01:13:03,187 --> 01:13:04,058
Hawkins.

946
01:13:05,706 --> 01:13:07,632
No. No teams.

947
01:13:08,336 --> 01:13:09,558
I hunt alone.

948
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,092
What do you want me
to do about the girl?

949
01:13:21,332 --> 01:13:22,462
Understood.

950
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:41,681
Are you going to get
my Vilma back?

951
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:53,617
Go on.

952
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:55,876
I don't care.

953
01:13:58,195 --> 01:14:01,287
I don't want to live
without her anyway.

954
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:11,278
Do you believe
that things happen
for a reason?

955
01:14:13,944 --> 01:14:14,944
You mean, like fate?

956
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:19,596
There's really
no other explanation
for all this, is there?

957
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,855
You and me?

958
01:14:22,747 --> 01:14:26,118
I'm just...
happy to see you again.

959
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,737
Everything makes
so much sense now.

960
01:14:34,867 --> 01:14:38,996
The day you left,
people said you'd gone crazy

961
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:41,311
- and burned your house down.
- People said that?

962
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:43,266
About me?

963
01:14:54,986 --> 01:14:56,764
You ever think
about going home?

964
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:00,206
Yeah.

965
01:15:01,614 --> 01:15:02,762
All the time.

966
01:15:05,169 --> 01:15:07,762
It's been a year now
and I just...

967
01:15:09,228 --> 01:15:13,636
I feel like I keep getting
further and further away.
You know?

968
01:15:14,435 --> 01:15:18,009
At least you have a family to go back to.
Someday.

969
01:15:21,513 --> 01:15:24,531
I wonder if this Light Bringer
knows anything about me.

970
01:15:25,177 --> 01:15:29,436
You know, maybe...
maybe I have a prophecy, too.

971
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:32,640
Don't jinx yourself.

972
01:15:33,343 --> 01:15:34,343
Still got it.

973
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:39,970
It's almost too easy,
isn't it?

974
01:15:41,062 --> 01:15:43,747
Mortal wenches.
God bless 'em.

975
01:15:44,436 --> 01:15:47,714
You know, you really
shouldn't say that stuff.

976
01:15:48,769 --> 01:15:49,399
Why?

977
01:15:50,606 --> 01:15:52,791
Because it's derogatory
towards women.

978
01:15:54,754 --> 01:15:56,884
No, but I'm saying that
I like that they're easy.

979
01:15:59,596 --> 01:16:00,448
Weird.

980
01:16:01,855 --> 01:16:02,966
You kids ready to go?

981
01:16:05,003 --> 01:16:05,855
Come on, Gabe.

982
01:16:07,188 --> 01:16:09,059
I'm riding in back
with Azazel.

983
01:16:13,608 --> 01:16:14,386
What is it?

984
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:19,831
Nothing to worry
your pretty little head over.

985
01:16:20,815 --> 01:16:22,019
Let's go.

986
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:41,444
The aerospace manufacturer
pleaded guilty to two counts

987
01:16:41,507 --> 01:16:43,508
of violating the Federal
Clean Water Act,

988
01:16:43,534 --> 01:16:46,335
admitting dumping
industrial discharge
into the river.

989
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:49,337
In addition to being placed
on probation for five years,

990
01:16:49,379 --> 01:16:52,063
the company agreed to pay
$1 million in fines

991
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,236
and to contribute
another $11 million
for environmental
improvement projects.

992
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:58,039
Good God,
what is happening
to this place?

993
01:16:58,166 --> 01:17:01,205
Human beings used to care
about the Earth, you know?

994
01:17:01,612 --> 01:17:03,706
They used to appreciate
just how good they had it.

995
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,619
Guess a lot has changed
in 5,000 years.

996
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:16,427
Will this Light Bringer
know who my father is?

997
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:19,873
You sure that's something
you want to find out?

998
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:24,102
Most Nephilim don't
want anything to do
with their fathers.

999
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,382
Human women can't
survive the births.

1000
01:17:29,027 --> 01:17:31,732
At first, we were like,
whoops, you know?

1001
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,382
But it didn't take us long
to figure out that, you know,

1002
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:37,735
getting one pregnant
was like handing down
a death sentence.

1003
01:17:38,703 --> 01:17:41,186
So they all die?
All our mothers?

1004
01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:43,280
Every one of 'em.

1005
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:47,746
Your old man still sound
like someone you wanna
go fishing with?

1006
01:17:48,469 --> 01:17:49,877
Play catch?

1007
01:17:49,988 --> 01:17:51,470
I just want to know
who he is.

1008
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,532
We're being followed.

1009
01:17:55,643 --> 01:17:56,384
What?

1010
01:17:57,644 --> 01:17:58,867
By who?

1011
01:17:59,497 --> 01:18:00,498
I don't know.

1012
01:18:01,113 --> 01:18:03,096
Pull over.
Let me deal with it.

1013
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,825
It's time, traitor.

1014
01:18:09,622 --> 01:18:12,220
Time for you to say good-bye
to something you hold dear.

1015
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:17,241
Perhaps your eyes.

1016
01:18:18,357 --> 01:18:21,970
No. There's a certain
nobility in blindness.

1017
01:18:22,785 --> 01:18:26,324
I could cut out your tongue,
but then once you're broken,

1018
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:29,293
you wouldn't
be able to tell me
what I want to know.

1019
01:18:30,515 --> 01:18:31,460
Sachael.

1020
01:18:32,428 --> 01:18:33,706
I want to see his wings.

1021
01:18:33,736 --> 01:18:35,292
Mazarin, no.
You can't...

1022
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:36,398
That wasn't a request.

1023
01:18:37,529 --> 01:18:38,288
Just do it.

1024
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:41,450
Mazarin.

1025
01:18:43,133 --> 01:18:44,706
You are lost.

1026
01:18:45,539 --> 01:18:49,873
You do not serve
the Creator.

1027
01:18:56,326 --> 01:18:57,324
Mazarin.

1028
01:19:13,239 --> 01:19:14,387
Mazarin.

1029
01:19:18,294 --> 01:19:20,163
You are the one who's lost.

1030
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:21,975
And as for the Creator...

1031
01:19:22,882 --> 01:19:26,009
what I do now,
I do in his name.

1032
01:19:33,695 --> 01:19:37,599
And now, you take
your true place
amongst the Fallen.

1033
01:20:00,776 --> 01:20:01,923
Looking for something?

1034
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:04,772
Anane.

1035
01:20:11,227 --> 01:20:13,132
I picked up your scent
just outside of town,

1036
01:20:13,798 --> 01:20:15,555
and I've been following you
ever since.

1037
01:20:18,775 --> 01:20:20,051
How did you escape?

1038
01:20:21,092 --> 01:20:23,312
I am so sick of everybody
asking me that question.

1039
01:20:23,337 --> 01:20:24,410
Maybe I didn't escape.

1040
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:28,399
Maybe the Creator decided
I was such a perfect specimen
he'd set me free.

1041
01:20:29,098 --> 01:20:29,875
Did he?

1042
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,889
That's not the point.
What do you want?

1043
01:20:35,481 --> 01:20:37,312
I want to know
if I'm worthy
of redemption.

1044
01:20:37,872 --> 01:20:40,703
I can tell that
you want it really bad.

1045
01:20:42,145 --> 01:20:44,809
But I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that right now.

1046
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:48,822
I see.

1047
01:20:50,932 --> 01:20:52,578
It's nothing personal, okay?

1048
01:20:52,670 --> 01:20:53,484
I just...

1049
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,984
I don't know
how much time
I have left.

1050
01:21:02,947 --> 01:21:04,334
Nathaniel did this to me.

1051
01:21:05,592 --> 01:21:06,776
He was looking for you.

1052
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:12,733
It's too late for me
to be healed.

1053
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,258
The wound is too old,
too deep.

1054
01:21:17,313 --> 01:21:18,608
It's killing me.

1055
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:22,530
You know what happens
to angels when they die
without redemption?

1056
01:21:23,570 --> 01:21:26,771
We don't have souls.
Not like you do.

1057
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:30,697
There's...
There's no Heaven for us.

1058
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:32,658
No Hell.
Just...

1059
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,030
Just nothingness.

1060
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:37,287
Forever.

1061
01:21:40,492 --> 01:21:42,490
And that scares me
more than anything.

1062
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,044
Yeah, well,
tough luck, Anane.

1063
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:47,287
Welcome to the yawning
abyss of oblivion.

1064
01:21:58,971 --> 01:21:59,840
Aaron.

1065
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:04,521
You have to help him.
Please?

1066
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:07,443
I want to.

1067
01:22:09,053 --> 01:22:11,161
I really do.
It's just that...

1068
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:15,195
Ariel told me not to
until I know
it's the right thing.

1069
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:20,014
He wants to go back to Heaven
and you can do that for him.

1070
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:22,937
How can you refuse?

1071
01:22:23,492 --> 01:22:26,082
Look in your heart.
You know it's right.

1072
01:22:31,455 --> 01:22:34,229
Wait a second.
You're not actually
considering this, are you?

1073
01:22:35,844 --> 01:22:38,730
With that amount of energy,
you're just going to call
the Powers right to us.

1074
01:22:38,952 --> 01:22:40,007
I know that.

1075
01:22:43,749 --> 01:22:45,951
But Vilma's right.
I can't just...

1076
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:47,986
let him die.

1077
01:22:49,059 --> 01:22:50,631
Aaron, don't.

1078
01:23:02,333 --> 01:23:03,462
You ready?

1079
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:07,642
Yeah.

1080
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:44,038
Stay with the traitor.

1081
01:23:44,260 --> 01:23:45,222
Sachael.

1082
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,672
You.

1083
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:01,157
I need your help.

1084
01:24:16,116 --> 01:24:17,929
Fantastic!

1085
01:24:19,353 --> 01:24:22,055
You are a genius
of epic proportions,
my friend.

1086
01:24:22,799 --> 01:24:24,723
That was great. Yeah.
'Cause, uh...

1087
01:24:24,945 --> 01:24:26,258
we got away

1088
01:24:27,035 --> 01:24:28,774
and it was plain sailing
the whole time.

1089
01:24:28,885 --> 01:24:32,522
But now it's brilliant
because they know
exactly where we are.

1090
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,773
I'm really proud of you.
Well done.

1091
01:24:35,845 --> 01:24:37,141
Look, just shut up,
all right?

1092
01:24:37,325 --> 01:24:39,268
Hey, I'm trying
to look out for you.

1093
01:24:40,215 --> 01:24:41,344
Trying to keep you alive.

1094
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:44,033
The rest of the Fallen
will be plenty pissed with me

1095
01:24:44,076 --> 01:24:45,704
if you died on my watch.

1096
01:24:47,017 --> 01:24:48,165
I'm just saying...

1097
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:51,069
I'm not afraid
of the Powers.

1098
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:52,494
You?

1099
01:24:54,326 --> 01:24:55,806
I'm not afraid of anything.

1100
01:24:57,915 --> 01:24:58,932
Well, that's good.

1101
01:25:01,397 --> 01:25:02,748
Because here they come.

1102
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:09,615
I'm gonna put
an end to this.

1103
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,303
I'm not running
from them anymore.

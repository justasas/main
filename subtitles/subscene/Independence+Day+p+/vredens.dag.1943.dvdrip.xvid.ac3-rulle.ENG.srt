1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,018
DAY OF WRATH

2
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:10,628
Day of Wrath, dreadful night,

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:14,592
Heaven and earth in ashes burning,

4
00:00:14,902 --> 00:00:18,303
And the sun beset by dead of night.

5
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:21,835
That Day of Wrath, that sulfurous day

6
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:24,972
When flaming heavens together roll,

7
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,871
And earth's beautiful castle
shall pass away.

8
00:00:29,216 --> 00:00:32,185
Day of Wrath, when we shall

9
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,554
Awake from clay to judgment

10
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:38,856
And be brought to our enchanted hour.

11
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:42,660
Day of Wrath, the mighty trumpet's tone

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,990
Calls forth the living and the dead

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,269
And shall rend
each tomb's sepulchral stone.

14
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,267
Day of Wrath, by God unleashed,

15
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,541
Behold Satan's ghastly abacus

16
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:00,573
Shown before the Judge's gaze.

17
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,778
The Day of Wrath, that judgment day,

18
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,120
Then shall be heard with universal dread

19
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,987
The sins revealed as they are read.

20
00:01:10,357 --> 00:01:13,155
Day of Wrath, O, see them stand

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,958
Before His Throne, small and grim,

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,798
Clad in shame and rancid sin.

23
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:21,667
Day of Wrath, for pity take

24
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:24,832
My sins away from Satan's grasp

25
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,339
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

26
00:01:32,179 --> 00:01:34,670
And whereas the said Herlof's Marte

27
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:37,214
is denounced as a witch

28
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:40,113
by three respected and worthy citizens,

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,050
we rule that she be seized

30
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:46,590
and brought before the Court.

31
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:06,212
If only it helps!

32
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:10,342
It is sure to.
They're herbs from under the gallows!

33
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:14,913
It's strange they have so much power.

34
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:17,715
There is power in Evil!

35
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,726
Who are they hunting now?

36
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:21,845
<i>She'll be put on the stake,</i>

37
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,216
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

38
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,449
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

39
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,628
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

40
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,319
<i>She'll be put on the stake,</i>

41
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,464
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

42
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:35,032
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

43
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,793
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

44
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:57,520
<i>Open up. Open up, Herlof's Marte</i>

45
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,090
Put these away.

46
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:53,109
Absalon, Martin should be here soon.

47
00:04:54,314 --> 00:04:55,906
The ship has just come in.

48
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,942
I'll be there right away.

49
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:09,792
Have you the key to the loft?

50
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,459
May I have it?

51
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:21,400
In this house

52
00:05:21,675 --> 00:05:23,540
I carry the keys.

53
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,243
I am Absalon's wife.

54
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:28,110
But I am his mother.

55
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,986
It is not easy for an old dog
to learn new tricks.

56
00:05:41,895 --> 00:05:44,523
Nor is it easy for a young wife

57
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:46,995
to come into an old household.

58
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,772
You are too hard on her.

59
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,005
I want her to be a good wife to you.

60
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:03,341
She is.

61
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:08,446
When your first wife was alive...

62
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:11,215
She is not alive anymore.

63
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:15,127
No, but her son is alive.

64
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:21,024
And now he's coming home...

65
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,026
home to a new mother

66
00:06:24,871 --> 00:06:28,568
many years younger than he.

67
00:06:28,775 --> 00:06:30,299
What does it matter?

68
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,134
Matter?

69
00:06:33,013 --> 00:06:36,278
<i>I think it is... scandalous.</i>

70
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:41,477
I'm going out to meet Martin.

71
00:07:24,764 --> 00:07:26,197
Is Master Absalon at home?

72
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,527
No, he has gone to meet his son.

73
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,668
I am his son.

74
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:36,940
Are you his son?

75
00:07:38,211 --> 00:07:39,769
<i>Are you his wife?</i>

76
00:07:56,363 --> 00:07:58,888
It seems I've seen your face before.

77
00:07:59,165 --> 00:08:01,065
Where would that have been?

78
00:08:03,236 --> 00:08:05,204
Perhaps in my thoughts.

79
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,932
I have thought about you
many, many times...

80
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:15,308
wondering what you would say
to so young a mother.

81
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,581
I promise to be a good son to you!

82
00:08:19,786 --> 00:08:22,653
Yes... you are my son now.

83
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,815
And you, my mother.

84
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:28,289
My grown son.

85
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:43,837
What is keeping father?

86
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:50,872
Here comes father now.

87
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:53,014
Anne, shall we surprise him?
I'll hide.

88
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:57,184
Didn't Martin come with you?

89
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,982
Hasn't he come yet?

90
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,057
He'll be here soon.

91
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:03,023
Yes, he probably will.

92
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:22,209
What's this?
It's Martin's songbook.

93
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:29,255
Here is the song of
the Maiden and the Apple Tree.

94
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,081
A Maiden

95
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:35,250
sat in an apple tree high.
A lad chanced to pass by.

96
00:09:35,495 --> 00:09:37,793
She stretched, the bough it bent.

97
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,091
Within his arms she landed.

98
00:09:54,414 --> 00:10:00,910
This is so nice. Don't you want
to give your mother a kiss?

99
00:10:08,995 --> 00:10:10,690
Shall we go to my study?

100
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,023
Yes, father.

101
00:10:58,545 --> 00:10:59,739
You're bleeding!

102
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,773
It's nothing.

103
00:11:05,085 --> 00:11:09,522
You must help me, hide me!

104
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,953
They will burn me if they catch me!

105
00:11:15,328 --> 00:11:17,228
Have they denounced you as a witch?

106
00:11:24,404 --> 00:11:26,065
I helped your mother.

107
00:11:29,542 --> 00:11:31,567
She too was denounced as a witch.

108
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:34,580
My mother? It's not true.

109
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:38,506
It is true! She was set free

110
00:11:38,718 --> 00:11:40,811
<i>only because you were her daughter.</i>

111
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,484
You cannot send me out to my death...

112
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,621
<i>Get firewood for the oven.</i>

113
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:54,391
<i>And Bente, clean the fish.</i>

114
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:09,036
Where are you going?

115
00:12:09,282 --> 00:12:10,271
Nowhere.

116
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,652
Is that cupboard to remain open?

117
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,977
Grandmother. Grandmother.

118
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,791
Why are you so quiet, Anne?

119
00:13:13,646 --> 00:13:15,773
We are looking for Herlof's Marte.

120
00:13:16,082 --> 00:13:17,413
Here?

121
00:13:17,617 --> 00:13:19,050
In the rectory?

122
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,750
Some children saw her come in here.

123
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:25,757
But that is impossible... then we must...

124
00:13:27,927 --> 00:13:30,020
Have you seen Herlof's Marte?

125
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,304
If she is here, she must have sneaked in...
Yes, look for her.

126
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,560
Bloodstains... Over here.

127
00:14:08,868 --> 00:14:10,733
Is there another entrance to the loft?

128
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:12,937
Yes, by the other staircase.

129
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:15,500
Tell Hans and Henrik to go up that way.

130
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:56,043
The Lord have mercy upon us!

131
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:12,587
And this should have been a day of joy!

132
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,668
I order that the Notary of the Chapter

133
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:26,140
the Reverend Absalon Pederssøn

134
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,042
take the said Herlof's Marte
to confession.

135
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:32,411
He shall diligently exhort her
to confess the full truth

136
00:15:32,618 --> 00:15:36,384
that she may not die without
penance, but her soul be saved.

137
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:53,898
Help me, Absalon.
Save me from the stake.

138
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,168
Only God can help you.

139
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:00,633
You can. If you want.

140
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:12,818
I ask only that you do for me
what you did for Anne's mother.

141
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,411
What do you mean?

142
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,449
<i>You spared her.</i>

143
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:19,156
Do not say more than you can answer for.

144
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,926
I know what I say.

145
00:17:21,794 --> 00:17:25,161
You knew she was a witch,
but you kept silent...

146
00:17:26,065 --> 00:17:26,861
You lie!

147
00:17:27,066 --> 00:17:29,762
You kept silent for Anne's sake.

148
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:49,445
Come here.

149
00:17:58,531 --> 00:17:59,259
Kneel.

150
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,525
I'm begging for my life.

151
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:09,106
You shall not beg for your life.
You should pray for your soul.

152
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:17,948
Confess the truth.

153
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:21,185
What shall I confess?

154
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:23,283
That you are a witch.

155
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:31,755
A witch? I knew of one...

156
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:36,328
She was Anne's mother,
and you set her free.

157
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:39,536
Be quiet.

158
00:19:02,295 --> 00:19:06,527
I am so terribly afraid... to die.

159
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:09,865
Come with me.

160
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:32,152
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning.</i>

161
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:37,995
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning</i>

162
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,298
You're here.

163
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:44,761
I came to listen to the singing.

164
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:48,837
<i>Day of Wrath that...</i>

165
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,908
<i>Day of Wrath...</i>

166
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,178
Why are they learning that?

167
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:57,109
To sing when Herlof's Marte is burned.

168
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:02,111
I hear her screams all the time.

169
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:06,081
Come, let's go.

170
00:20:06,959 --> 00:20:12,056
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders</i>

171
00:20:12,965 --> 00:20:18,631
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends.</i>

172
00:20:21,807 --> 00:20:23,297
The old one's giving in.

173
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,578
Will you confess?

174
00:20:29,181 --> 00:20:30,705
Yes.

175
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:33,116
Finally.

176
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:37,313
Release her.

177
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:57,374
Thereafter she consented
to a confession.

178
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:23,497
Tell us how you entered
the service of the Evil One?

179
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:27,497
Answer!

180
00:21:30,543 --> 00:21:32,010
So you will not confess...

181
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:35,172
She hasn't had enough.

182
00:21:35,181 --> 00:21:37,308
I have.

183
00:21:37,516 --> 00:21:38,915
Answer me then.

184
00:21:39,118 --> 00:21:41,018
Where did you first meet the Devil?

185
00:21:42,888 --> 00:21:44,321
Under the gallows?

186
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,149
You had to trample on the cross?

187
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,851
He forbade you
to receive the Sacrament?

188
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:53,596
You had to abjure God and Christ

189
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,763
and sell your soul
to the Devil for eternity.

190
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,769
Have you anything more to confess?

191
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,700
No.

192
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:13,016
A fine confession!

193
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:18,222
She is difficult.

194
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:29,596
Ask her if she knows of others.

195
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,747
We haven't finished yet.
Do you know any other witches?

196
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:44,049
No.

197
00:22:44,583 --> 00:22:45,743
Have you known any?

198
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:50,980
Is there anyone you can denounce?

199
00:22:52,758 --> 00:22:53,782
She is dead now.

200
00:22:53,993 --> 00:22:54,925
Who was she?

201
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:04,595
Who she was... who she was?

202
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:10,808
Well, who was she?
Give me her name.

203
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,577
I do not remember.

204
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,809
But I'll remember you!

205
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:18,842
How's that?

206
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:21,682
Send me to my death...

207
00:23:21,887 --> 00:23:23,514
and yours will follow!

208
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,751
Your threats don't move me.

209
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,158
You'd better tell me her name.

210
00:23:41,173 --> 00:23:43,107
I'll say no more.

211
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,539
I have said enough.

212
00:23:54,887 --> 00:23:56,787
You better loosen your tongue...

213
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:05,260
That's enough.
I will speak to her myself.

214
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:31,449
Save me from the stake!

215
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,887
I know... you will stand by me.

216
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:41,598
I beseech Thee, O Lord,

217
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,893
that this woman may repent

218
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,198
and that she may turn to Thee

219
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:49,540
and seek her salvation.

220
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:58,049
Take courage... be strong.

221
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:04,284
Take her away.

222
00:25:07,226 --> 00:25:08,591
Come with me.

223
00:25:54,073 --> 00:25:55,404
She named no one?

224
00:25:57,109 --> 00:25:59,407
Perhaps, put to the question again.

225
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,138
All will be made known
in God's own good time!

226
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:09,549
Herlof's Marte was subjected
to painful interrogation

227
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:14,124
after which she made
a full voluntary confession

228
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:17,261
in the presence of
the assembled clergy.

229
00:26:17,463 --> 00:26:20,694
June 14, 1623
Absalon Pederssøn - Jørgen Ravn

230
00:27:54,626 --> 00:27:55,854
Gathering firewood already?

231
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:57,619
No, wood for the stake.

232
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:28,956
I have come to prepare you...
for death.

233
00:28:30,095 --> 00:28:31,960
So you have failed me.

234
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:35,065
No, I have not failed you.

235
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:39,401
I have thought of you
these many days.

236
00:28:40,272 --> 00:28:44,766
How I could secure for you...
Life Eternal.

237
00:28:45,477 --> 00:28:47,502
Stop all your prattle.

238
00:28:47,713 --> 00:28:51,774
I fear neither Heaven nor Hell.
I am only afraid to die.

239
00:28:55,888 --> 00:28:57,378
I spared Anne.

240
00:28:58,023 --> 00:28:59,615
And you fail me.

241
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:01,884
No, Marte.

242
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:04,252
But it is not too late.

243
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:08,390
Anne shall suffer as I suffer.

244
00:29:10,636 --> 00:29:14,834
If I burn at the stake, so shall Anne.

245
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:22,113
No, no...

246
00:29:23,682 --> 00:29:27,948
If they burn me...
If they burn me...

247
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:33,515
I don't want to be burned.
I don't want to.

248
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:42,666
I don't want to.

249
00:29:53,011 --> 00:29:54,603
Go.

250
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,915
Go! Get out!

251
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,207
<i>She'll be put on the stake,</i>

252
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,504
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

253
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,579
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

254
00:30:30,782 --> 00:30:33,012
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

255
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:37,454
<i>She'll be put on the stake,</i>

256
00:30:37,656 --> 00:30:39,749
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

257
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:42,290
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

258
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:45,486
<i>With smoldering flesh.</i>

259
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:15,721
Are you leaving?

260
00:31:16,028 --> 00:31:17,689
I cannot stand this.

261
00:32:18,123 --> 00:32:19,681
Stay here with me.

262
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,496
I want to speak to Absalon!

263
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:30,099
What for?

264
00:32:30,702 --> 00:32:32,329
I want to speak to Absalon!

265
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:34,402
Do you want to denounce someone?

266
00:32:34,606 --> 00:32:36,369
I want to speak to Absalon.

267
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,757
The condemned would like
to speak to you.

268
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:21,809
Free me from the stake.
Otherwise...

269
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,116
Have no fear.
The Lord is merciful.

270
00:33:26,324 --> 00:33:30,090
He will open your eyes
and turn your soul from sin.

271
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:33,463
I will denounce Anne,
do you hear me!

272
00:33:34,332 --> 00:33:35,959
You'll suffer for this!

273
00:33:51,716 --> 00:33:56,653
The Devil will get you,
you hypocrite, you liar!

274
00:33:56,855 --> 00:34:01,189
You liar. You liar. You liar.

275
00:34:05,864 --> 00:34:11,166
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning</i>

276
00:34:11,736 --> 00:34:16,935
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning</i>

277
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:23,104
<i>Heaven and earth in ashes burning</i>

278
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,246
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders</i>

279
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:37,693
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends</i>

280
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:44,493
<i>On whose sentence all depends</i>

281
00:34:46,071 --> 00:34:49,438
<i>Wondrous sounds the trumpet sings</i>

282
00:34:52,978 --> 00:34:56,175
On this beauteous day,
Herlof's Marte was successfully

283
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:58,941
burned at the stake.
Glory be to God.

284
00:35:23,175 --> 00:35:27,339
<i>Lord, I beseech Thee with all my heart,</i>

285
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:30,740
<i>help me in my hour of need!</i>

286
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:37,578
<i>I have been a faithful servant,
and have kept Thy commandments.</i>

287
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:41,225
<i>Yet now my innermost soul
is shaken by gnawing doubt.</i>

288
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:44,224
<i>O Lord,
let thy light shine upon me...</i>

289
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:52,598
<i>that I may find my way out
of this terrible darkness.</i>

290
00:36:10,522 --> 00:36:11,682
Do you want something?

291
00:36:12,991 --> 00:36:13,958
Yes.

292
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,465
Something is tormenting you.

293
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:33,833
What is it? Tell your mother.

294
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:41,417
Mother, I have sinned.

295
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:45,656
Sinned against God.

296
00:36:47,859 --> 00:36:49,918
I have lied to Him.

297
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:58,964
How? Tell me.
I'm your mother, aren't I?

298
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,502
Yes.

299
00:37:03,408 --> 00:37:07,003
But this is a fight I must fight alone.

300
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:41,608
You've changed since
Herlof's Marte was arrested.

301
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,282
And now she has burned at the
stake. You've become so strange.

302
00:37:58,496 --> 00:38:00,430
Did she...

303
00:38:00,632 --> 00:38:02,623
denounce another?

304
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:05,568
And you're keeping it secret?

305
00:38:07,339 --> 00:38:09,933
She denounced no living person.

306
00:38:10,175 --> 00:38:15,670
No living person?
No one living.

307
00:38:28,026 --> 00:38:31,621
Have you ever looked into
Anne's eyes?

308
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:35,923
Have you seen how they burn?

309
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,933
I am thinking of her mother.

310
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:45,876
Her eyes burned in the same way.

311
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,642
Why are you saying this?

312
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,841
The day may come when you must
choose between...

313
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:54,348
Between what?

314
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:57,453
Between God and Anne.

315
00:38:59,524 --> 00:39:02,015
You say that because you hate Anne.

316
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:08,461
No, out of love to you!

317
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:54,472
Goodnight, Grandmother.

318
00:39:56,014 --> 00:39:57,379
Goodnight, Martin.

319
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:05,156
Goodnight.

320
00:40:26,678 --> 00:40:28,145
Goodnight, father.

321
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,411
Goodnight, my son.

322
00:40:48,566 --> 00:40:55,096
Anne, there is something
we must discuss.

323
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:58,799
It concerns your mother.

324
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:00,867
My mother?

325
00:41:16,628 --> 00:41:18,994
Is it that... that mother?

326
00:41:19,197 --> 00:41:20,186
You know?

327
00:41:20,398 --> 00:41:22,958
Yes... But is it true?

328
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:24,701
She confessed it.

329
00:41:26,538 --> 00:41:27,903
What did she confess?

330
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:31,707
That she had the power of invocation.

331
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,581
She could call up
the Living and the Dead.

332
00:41:38,783 --> 00:41:40,375
And they had to come.

333
00:41:40,852 --> 00:41:42,945
If she wished someone dead,

334
00:41:43,154 --> 00:41:44,485
he died.

335
00:41:58,937 --> 00:42:01,405
Is it true you spared her
to marry me?

336
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:03,596
Do you blame me for that?

337
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,010
For being kind to mother? No.

338
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:08,812
But?

339
00:42:09,714 --> 00:42:11,705
Were you also kind to me?

340
00:42:12,684 --> 00:42:14,447
Have I not been a kind husband?

341
00:42:14,686 --> 00:42:18,122
Yes, you have.
Did you ever ask me if I loved you?

342
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:22,591
You were so young,
just a child.

343
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,418
But did I love you?

344
00:42:25,563 --> 00:42:27,121
It is strange...

345
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:29,963
I never thought of that.

346
00:42:30,535 --> 00:42:33,197
No, I suppose you haven't.

347
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:59,857
Absalon, hold me.
Hold me and make me happy.

348
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:15,743
I must look into myself.
I have much to speak to God about.

349
00:43:22,954 --> 00:43:24,319
Goodnight, Anne.

350
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:30,923
Look into my eyes.

351
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,863
Your wonderful eyes.

352
00:43:36,367 --> 00:43:38,699
So childlike.

353
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,931
Pure and clear...

354
00:43:52,183 --> 00:43:53,514
Goodnight.

355
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,618
How was it with my mother?

356
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:08,996
She could call
the Living and the Dead.

357
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:12,768
And they had to come.
Was that it?

358
00:44:13,471 --> 00:44:14,995
Why do you ask?

359
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:19,639
I think it strange that...
with the power mother had...

360
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:26,574
A human being can have such power...

361
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:35,910
I can do it. I can do it.

362
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:51,668
Anne, you're crying.

363
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,668
I see you through my tears.

364
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:02,238
Tears that I wipe away.

365
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,920
No one has eyes like yours.

366
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,159
What are they like?

367
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:19,594
Childlike?

368
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:22,260
Pure and clear?

369
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,527
No, deep and mysterious.

370
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:30,366
But in their depths I see

371
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:36,574
a trembling, quivering flame

372
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:39,440
<i>which you have kindled.</i>

373
00:46:42,453 --> 00:46:45,013
Let's go to the birches.

374
00:47:24,262 --> 00:47:26,025
How happy I am!

375
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:31,265
Just to say "I love you".

376
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:34,136
And to know...

377
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:36,833
That you and I...

378
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:43,106
You were always in my thoughts.

379
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:45,679
And you in my dreams.

380
00:48:19,984 --> 00:48:21,576
Here's the spring.

381
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:25,182
Come here.

382
00:48:41,872 --> 00:48:42,998
More?

383
00:48:43,207 --> 00:48:44,572
Water? No.

384
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:46,071
Of what then?

385
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:49,438
Drink.

386
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:42,659
Hear how they whisper.

387
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:44,332
It's the grass humming.

388
00:49:45,169 --> 00:49:46,602
Humming what?

389
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,071
A song about the two of us.

390
00:49:49,673 --> 00:49:51,971
The song of your love.

391
00:49:52,476 --> 00:49:53,966
And of yours.

392
00:49:55,246 --> 00:50:03,210
Hold me tight. Make me happy.

393
00:50:08,392 --> 00:50:13,193
...so that we may wander decently

394
00:50:13,397 --> 00:50:18,198
and securely in the sight of God.

395
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:24,807
Through this Your most Holy Name. Amen.

396
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:31,678
May I read a little
from the Song of Songs?

397
00:50:31,882 --> 00:50:33,611
Yes, please do.

398
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:40,782
I am the rose of Sharon,
and the lily of the valleys.

399
00:50:40,991 --> 00:50:44,449
As the lily among thorns,
so is my love among the daughters.

400
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:49,259
As the apple tree among the trees
of the wood, so is my beloved.

401
00:50:50,367 --> 00:50:51,664
I sat down under his shadow.

402
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:53,764
We have heard enough.

403
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:54,064
Will you stop it!

404
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,614
Wretched woman.

405
00:52:21,492 --> 00:52:22,516
Grandmother?

406
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:26,025
I meant it.

407
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:31,801
Martin, what have we done to you?

408
00:52:32,269 --> 00:52:35,727
You seem so far apart from us now.

409
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,568
Both from me and your father.

410
00:52:43,047 --> 00:52:45,572
Promise me to think of your father

411
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,510
and do not cause him grief.

412
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,036
Martin, would you help me?

413
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:14,768
Yes, of course.

414
00:53:34,498 --> 00:53:35,829
Grandmother does not like you.

415
00:53:36,267 --> 00:53:38,792
What does it matter -
if you like me?

416
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:42,202
If you love me.

417
00:53:43,073 --> 00:53:45,268
Anne, how will this all end?

418
00:53:56,186 --> 00:53:57,153
Kiss me.

419
00:53:59,123 --> 00:54:00,784
<i>Then I'll kiss you.</i>

420
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:39,987
There you are.

421
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:54,903
Shut the door.

422
00:54:59,116 --> 00:55:03,348
It's the first time I hear Anne laugh.

423
00:55:08,025 --> 00:55:09,890
How she's changed.

424
00:55:10,928 --> 00:55:13,692
Even her voice is different.

425
00:55:15,366 --> 00:55:18,358
<i>Yes... she is changed.</i>

426
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,529
When I see those two together

427
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:27,604
I feel for the first time how old I am...
And how young she is.

428
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:38,281
It is good Martin came home.

429
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:45,184
I will join them
and be young with the young.

430
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,372
It was nice to hear you laugh.

431
00:56:06,116 --> 00:56:08,880
We were just going.

432
00:56:09,953 --> 00:56:10,783
Where to?

433
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:12,080
To the river.

434
00:56:14,224 --> 00:56:17,387
I wanted to ask you to read
through my sermon.

435
00:56:17,594 --> 00:56:18,788
With pleasure, father.

436
00:56:18,996 --> 00:56:21,931
Oh, can't it wait,
I had so looked forward to this.

437
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:26,870
I would be the last
to deprive you of any pleasure.

438
00:56:27,204 --> 00:56:28,228
Go now.

439
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:07,240
It's the chaplain.

440
00:57:13,317 --> 00:57:15,785
A message from Master Laurentius.

441
00:57:16,453 --> 00:57:17,317
He is dying!

442
00:57:20,724 --> 00:57:23,318
He asks you to come and prepare him.

443
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:24,323
I've brought the Holy Vessels.

444
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:25,961
I'm going.

445
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:01,555
How alive your hands are.

446
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:04,025
Your fingers.

447
00:58:10,607 --> 00:58:11,767
Your wrist.

448
00:58:15,078 --> 00:58:16,602
I can feel your pulse beating.

449
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,479
Beating for you.

450
00:58:21,051 --> 00:58:24,282
The sun is coloring your cheeks.

451
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:27,116
Not the sun, happiness.

452
00:58:29,393 --> 00:58:32,487
Happiness?
How long will it last?

453
00:58:32,696 --> 00:58:34,163
Forever!

454
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:37,693
Anne, where will we end up?

455
00:58:37,901 --> 00:58:40,096
Wherever the stream leads us!

456
00:58:41,538 --> 00:58:42,300
One day.

457
00:58:42,506 --> 00:58:45,031
Don't think about it.
So much can happen.

458
00:58:46,577 --> 00:58:49,171
I see my father before me all the time.

459
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:51,580
I see only you.

460
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:07,347
Here I lie.

461
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:11,057
Soft and snug as in a mother's arms.

462
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:18,830
Herlof's Marte did not forget me.

463
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:20,760
What do you mean?

464
01:00:22,105 --> 01:00:24,096
She promised me death.

465
01:00:25,676 --> 01:00:28,770
She deserved her punishment.

466
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:32,470
I suppose so.

467
01:00:46,663 --> 01:00:49,131
Anne, let me go away.

468
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:51,666
Go away?

469
01:00:51,868 --> 01:00:54,428
Yes, let's separate for a bit.

470
01:00:54,638 --> 01:00:55,969
Separate?

471
01:00:59,342 --> 01:01:00,400
Separate.

472
01:01:01,678 --> 01:01:03,908
How could we two separate?

473
01:01:07,317 --> 01:01:10,514
Think of all we've given to each other.

474
01:01:11,688 --> 01:01:13,053
Look at that tree.

475
01:01:14,491 --> 01:01:15,651
Yes, it bows in sorrow.

476
01:01:15,859 --> 01:01:17,588
No, in longing.

477
01:01:18,929 --> 01:01:20,419
It grieves over us.

478
01:01:21,898 --> 01:01:24,526
It yearns after its own
reflection in the water.

479
01:01:26,103 --> 01:01:28,571
As those two can never
be torn asunder.

480
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,131
Nor can we ever separate.

481
01:01:56,032 --> 01:01:59,024
My body... is of this Earth.

482
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,402
And to the Earth I again submit it.

483
01:02:02,706 --> 01:02:05,800
My soul... I have from God.

484
01:02:06,276 --> 01:02:08,141
And unto God I surrender it.

485
01:02:16,353 --> 01:02:17,718
Give me your hands.

486
01:02:19,089 --> 01:02:20,750
Here, you have them.

487
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:23,917
That I may hold them

488
01:02:24,761 --> 01:02:26,456
till mine grow cold.

489
01:02:27,864 --> 01:02:31,197
It will not be long before I follow you.

490
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:32,766
You seek to comfort me.

491
01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:37,804
I often feel Death approaching.

492
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:42,773
But I go to meet it with courage.

493
01:02:42,979 --> 01:02:44,276
And hope!

494
01:02:46,883 --> 01:02:52,116
"Whosoever believeth shall live,
though he die."

495
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:57,126
If we could die... together, here.

496
01:03:02,032 --> 01:03:04,899
Die? Die?

497
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:06,794
Why?

498
01:03:07,103 --> 01:03:08,730
To atone for our sin.

499
01:03:09,172 --> 01:03:12,437
Sin? Is it a sin to love?

500
01:03:13,076 --> 01:03:18,605
Don't speak,
don't think anything except...

501
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:21,784
That we two belong together!

502
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:28,920
"As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood,

503
01:03:29,125 --> 01:03:30,956
"so is my beloved..."

504
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:34,890
"I sat down under his shadow..."

505
01:03:42,105 --> 01:03:43,663
What weather!

506
01:03:44,507 --> 01:03:46,998
We will hear of some misfortune
after such a storm.

507
01:03:47,477 --> 01:03:50,241
Does one hear of anything else
these days?

508
01:03:56,052 --> 01:03:58,077
Did you remember Absalon's beer?

509
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:00,949
No, I forgot.

510
01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:36,749
Accept this body of Jesus
who gave you life

511
01:04:37,027 --> 01:04:38,688
for you and your sins,

512
01:04:38,895 --> 01:04:42,956
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

513
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:52,871
Accept this cup poured for you
as the covenant in his blood,

514
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:58,506
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

515
01:05:13,863 --> 01:05:14,989
No, you can't look.

516
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:16,997
Oh, let me.

517
01:05:18,902 --> 01:05:20,392
Can you make it out?

518
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:22,701
A pear tree.

519
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:25,867
A pear tree!
Anyone can see it is an apple tree!

520
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,675
And here is an apple blossom.

521
01:05:29,412 --> 01:05:30,237
Only one?

522
01:05:30,246 --> 01:05:33,147
Yes, my apple tree has only
one blossom.

523
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:51,733
I hope Absalon won't come
across the bog.

524
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:54,563
If I knew the way he was coming,
I'd meet him.

525
01:05:56,306 --> 01:05:58,604
If you go through the bog,
he may go around it.

526
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:01,708
And if you go round it,
he may walk through it.

527
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,782
You must understand. Anne
wants you to stay at home.

528
01:06:08,018 --> 01:06:11,954
But Anne is right.
It is no use wandering about in the dark.

529
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:14,648
It is better to wait here for father.

530
01:06:18,728 --> 01:06:20,059
<i>Then we'll all wait.</i>

531
01:06:26,302 --> 01:06:27,269
You too?

532
01:06:31,341 --> 01:06:32,569
Then I will go to bed.

533
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:42,083
God have mercy on those at sea!

534
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:45,016
And on those not at sea!

535
01:06:46,289 --> 01:06:47,756
You are thinking of Absalon?

536
01:06:48,892 --> 01:06:51,383
Yes. And of you!

537
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:25,394
There is nothing so quiet as
a heart that has ceased to beat.

538
01:07:45,448 --> 01:07:47,882
You should get yourself a wife.

539
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:51,318
There's no hurry.

540
01:07:57,026 --> 01:08:01,258
There is no one in the world whom
I love as much as your father.

541
01:08:01,698 --> 01:08:07,000
In him God gave me the son
I had longed for.

542
01:08:07,203 --> 01:08:10,036
And I shall defend him until
the day I lie in my grave.

543
01:08:17,313 --> 01:08:20,714
Grandmother, why don't you like Anne?

544
01:08:22,118 --> 01:08:25,087
I have never done her any harm
that I know of.

545
01:08:25,288 --> 01:08:26,585
But you don't like her?

546
01:08:32,896 --> 01:08:36,263
<i>No, I do not like her.</i>

547
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:38,896
<i>I hate her.</i>

548
01:08:39,235 --> 01:08:40,566
Father's wife.

549
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:43,267
The only grief your father ever
caused me

550
01:08:43,473 --> 01:08:45,441
<i>was bringing her into this house.</i>

551
01:08:46,676 --> 01:08:48,007
How can you talk like that?

552
01:08:48,344 --> 01:08:50,904
Because it is the truth.

553
01:08:52,715 --> 01:08:54,580
A small, innocent woman.

554
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:56,812
Innocent?

555
01:09:06,729 --> 01:09:08,788
I've had my say.

556
01:09:15,905 --> 01:09:17,202
I shall go to bed.

557
01:09:22,045 --> 01:09:23,137
Goodnight, Martin.

558
01:09:25,415 --> 01:09:28,543
May the Lord have you in His keeping!

559
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:13,615
My Anne.

560
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:15,818
Yes, yours.

561
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:19,355
Yes... But my father's wife!

562
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,157
Wife, yes - I never loved him.

563
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:25,857
Nor he me.

564
01:11:27,837 --> 01:11:29,327
Do you never think of him?

565
01:11:31,974 --> 01:11:35,307
I often think, if he were dead...

566
01:11:36,312 --> 01:11:37,244
Do you wish him dead?

567
01:11:37,447 --> 01:11:41,349
<i>I think only if he were dead.</i>

568
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:49,748
Are you ill, Master Absalon?

569
01:11:50,326 --> 01:11:54,126
I felt
as if Death had just brushed by me.

570
01:11:55,832 --> 01:11:57,060
Death?

571
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:59,725
Yes, let's just go.

572
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:05,302
We will have a small house by the sea.

573
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:08,040
Every morning I shall wake...

574
01:12:08,244 --> 01:12:12,340
my head on your shoulder.

575
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:16,580
With a kiss I'll wake you.

576
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,750
Then we hear from his cradle

577
01:12:19,956 --> 01:12:21,981
a little Martin crying.

578
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,587
I pick him up.

579
01:12:27,463 --> 01:12:30,489
And as I found life at your breast

580
01:12:31,267 --> 01:12:33,599
he'll find life at mine.

581
01:12:35,471 --> 01:12:38,065
The tenderness you gave to me

582
01:12:38,341 --> 01:12:40,332
I give back to him.

583
01:12:41,811 --> 01:12:43,540
While I hum for him

584
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:46,477
a song about us two.

585
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:52,153
Isn't it lovely to think about?

586
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:56,552
Yes. It is only a dream.

587
01:12:58,361 --> 01:12:59,658
What does it matter?

588
01:13:00,363 --> 01:13:02,593
So long as it is a beautiful dream?

589
01:13:26,756 --> 01:13:28,747
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

590
01:13:29,025 --> 01:13:31,755
No, we waited up for you,
Martin and I.

591
01:13:35,031 --> 01:13:36,259
Good evening, Father.

592
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:37,797
Good evening, Martin.

593
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,476
You were away a long time.

594
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:51,606
How is Master Laurentius?

595
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:55,048
God gave him a mild death.

596
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:05,283
Would you like some beer?
It's been near the fire.

597
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:11,634
Thank you for waiting up,
both of you.

598
01:14:22,411 --> 01:14:25,141
Father, you are tired. You should rest.

599
01:14:25,982 --> 01:14:27,381
I am tired.

600
01:14:28,117 --> 01:14:30,176
But I don't think I can rest.

601
01:14:32,855 --> 01:14:34,550
I come from a man

602
01:14:34,957 --> 01:14:37,323
who died in piety.

603
01:14:40,129 --> 01:14:41,460
But otherwise,

604
01:14:41,864 --> 01:14:44,059
if I think of all the sighs

605
01:14:44,267 --> 01:14:46,701
from other deathbeds I have sat by,

606
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:52,173
I see only sin... and sin... and sin.

607
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,843
The pleasure of the moment.

608
01:14:55,177 --> 01:14:56,906
The secret sin.

609
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:00,044
Oh, Lord...

610
01:15:00,249 --> 01:15:03,514
What lives men lead.

611
01:15:03,853 --> 01:15:05,616
You speak so strangely.

612
01:15:08,658 --> 01:15:11,957
That is because I felt
a strange uneasiness.

613
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:15,897
Out there, earlier.

614
01:15:16,098 --> 01:15:18,828
I felt as if Death held me by the hand.

615
01:15:19,835 --> 01:15:21,769
I heard nothing.

616
01:15:22,038 --> 01:15:23,903
I saw nothing.

617
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:28,843
But in my innermost soul I felt

618
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:32,308
my death had been decided.

619
01:15:33,149 --> 01:15:35,413
You are tired.
You are ill.

620
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:40,116
I am not ill.
But I am tired.

621
01:15:41,424 --> 01:15:42,948
Go to bed now.

622
01:15:46,596 --> 01:15:48,826
Goodnight, my son. Sleep well.

623
01:15:56,238 --> 01:15:59,002
I wish I could ease your heavy thoughts.

624
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:02,241
You have yours to think about.

625
01:16:24,567 --> 01:16:26,592
You should not think so much of death.

626
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:31,633
You are right, Anne,
but I cannot get away from the thought.

627
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:36,737
My death has been decided!

628
01:16:37,313 --> 01:16:38,940
Who would want you dead?

629
01:16:39,682 --> 01:16:42,310
Who would?

630
01:16:45,254 --> 01:16:48,553
Anne, have you never wished me dead?

631
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:51,117
Why should I?

632
01:16:52,495 --> 01:16:53,792
Because

633
01:16:54,630 --> 01:16:56,564
I did you a great wrong.

634
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,835
I never asked you if you wished
to be mine... I took you.

635
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:06,731
I took your youth.

636
01:17:08,678 --> 01:17:12,705
That is a wrong for which
I can never make amends.

637
01:17:14,116 --> 01:17:15,981
Yes, it is true.

638
01:17:16,652 --> 01:17:18,449
You took my youth.

639
01:17:19,021 --> 01:17:20,784
My joy.

640
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:25,449
I burned for someone to love.

641
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:31,798
I dreamed

642
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:35,595
of a little child to hold in my arms.

643
01:17:39,508 --> 01:17:41,738
Not even that did you give me.

644
01:17:45,347 --> 01:17:48,111
You asked if I ever wished you were dead.

645
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:51,611
I have wished it hundreds of times.

646
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:57,685
I wished it when you were with me.

647
01:17:58,527 --> 01:18:01,360
I wished it when you left me.

648
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:09,236
But never did I wish it so hard
as since Martin and I...

649
01:18:09,472 --> 01:18:10,905
Martin? And you.

650
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:13,575
Yes. Martin and I.

651
01:18:14,543 --> 01:18:15,840
Now you know.

652
01:18:17,313 --> 01:18:20,544
Therefore, I now wish you dead.

653
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:22,647
<i>Dead!</i>

654
01:18:40,669 --> 01:18:43,467
Father. Father.

655
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:45,733
What is it?

656
01:19:56,145 --> 01:19:58,010
Shall I keep vigil now?

657
01:19:58,781 --> 01:20:02,182
No. Martin will keep vigil tonight.

658
01:20:10,192 --> 01:20:11,716
Why are you so quiet?

659
01:20:12,995 --> 01:20:14,155
Say something.

660
01:20:15,431 --> 01:20:16,455
Did he know?

661
01:20:16,966 --> 01:20:18,297
What do you mean?

662
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:20,894
Did he know that you and I...

663
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:25,204
You told him.

664
01:20:25,908 --> 01:20:28,900
He knew.
That's why he called out to me.

665
01:20:29,311 --> 01:20:32,337
I am cold! Keep me warm!

666
01:20:32,815 --> 01:20:34,749
I still hear his voice.

667
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,144
Father. Father.

668
01:20:45,728 --> 01:20:47,559
Are you weeping for him?

669
01:20:48,664 --> 01:20:49,653
Or me?

670
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:52,427
For myself.

671
01:20:53,168 --> 01:20:54,328
Why?

672
01:20:56,805 --> 01:20:58,864
I wish I were dead.

673
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:03,375
Everything, everything is over now.

674
01:21:04,246 --> 01:21:07,272
No, Martin. It's only the beginning.

675
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:09,081
Not for me.

676
01:21:09,285 --> 01:21:10,411
For us.

677
01:21:11,954 --> 01:21:13,478
Why should he die?

678
01:21:15,457 --> 01:21:17,925
I believe he died for our sake.

679
01:21:21,163 --> 01:21:24,496
I am afraid for you.

680
01:21:26,435 --> 01:21:28,130
I am afraid for the one I love.

681
01:21:28,337 --> 01:21:29,531
Are you going?

682
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:33,435
Have you no thought for me?

683
01:21:35,377 --> 01:21:37,868
<i>My only thought now is for him.</i>

684
01:22:09,511 --> 01:22:11,411
I'll stay and keep vigil.

685
01:22:48,117 --> 01:22:49,744
Shall I keep vigil with you?

686
01:22:51,653 --> 01:22:53,678
No, I'd like to be alone.

687
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:01,557
You shun me.

688
01:23:03,632 --> 01:23:05,156
I shun mostly myself.

689
01:23:08,837 --> 01:23:12,466
We should be on our knees

690
01:23:13,609 --> 01:23:15,270
asking his forgiveness.

691
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:19,805
I don't need to ask
forgiveness for anything.

692
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:23,645
But I know he would have forgiven us.

693
01:23:26,188 --> 01:23:28,122
He stands before God

694
01:23:28,323 --> 01:23:29,483
and accuses us.

695
01:23:29,691 --> 01:23:32,956
No, Martin.
He is interceding for us.

696
01:23:33,929 --> 01:23:35,794
For he sees how we suffer.

697
01:24:00,589 --> 01:24:02,420
Do you remember what you said:

698
01:24:02,958 --> 01:24:04,482
"If he were dead..."

699
01:24:06,829 --> 01:24:08,490
<i>You wished him dead.</i>

700
01:24:08,831 --> 01:24:09,991
<i>I only thought if.</i>

701
01:24:10,199 --> 01:24:11,860
<i>You did wish him dead.</i>

702
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:15,693
<i>But did you wish,
compel him to die?</i>

703
01:24:21,143 --> 01:24:23,441
Have you the power
to wish his death?

704
01:24:25,114 --> 01:24:26,012
Answer me.

705
01:24:26,782 --> 01:24:29,751
You are driving me to the stake.

706
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:33,213
Had you the power to wish his death?

707
01:24:33,589 --> 01:24:36,752
Come to your senses. Martin!
I love you.

708
01:24:36,959 --> 01:24:39,587
I love you.
That's my only crime.

709
01:24:41,864 --> 01:24:43,161
You wished him dead.

710
01:24:43,365 --> 01:24:46,766
Don't make me crazy, Martin!
You must believe me!

711
01:24:47,202 --> 01:24:49,102
I am not the cause of his death.

712
01:24:54,843 --> 01:24:57,004
Say it before his coffin.

713
01:25:04,052 --> 01:25:08,148
I am not the cause of his death.

714
01:25:13,295 --> 01:25:14,853
Do you believe me now?

715
01:25:15,731 --> 01:25:16,663
Yes.

716
01:25:37,519 --> 01:25:41,114
Shall we ever find each other again?

717
01:25:42,057 --> 01:25:43,684
Who could prevent it?

718
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,258
The dead.

719
01:25:47,162 --> 01:25:49,494
It's not the dead we should fear.

720
01:25:50,999 --> 01:25:52,626
You mean Marte.

721
01:26:07,382 --> 01:26:08,781
I love you.

722
01:26:09,484 --> 01:26:11,349
And you love me.

723
01:26:12,321 --> 01:26:14,084
We have sinned together.

724
01:26:14,556 --> 01:26:16,615
And we must also stand together.

725
01:26:19,428 --> 01:26:21,191
If Marte accuses me,

726
01:26:22,164 --> 01:26:23,893
will you stand by me?

727
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:27,534
I promise.

728
01:26:28,403 --> 01:26:30,337
You'll not let go of me?

729
01:26:32,174 --> 01:26:36,167
We are tied together so closely,
we can never be parted now.

730
01:26:39,514 --> 01:26:43,109
I believe happy days will come again.

731
01:26:43,452 --> 01:26:45,977
Even if we cannot see them now.

732
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:56,845
As the son and
heir of the dearly departed.

733
01:28:57,986 --> 01:29:00,477
I stand here, by his coffin

734
01:29:01,556 --> 01:29:03,080
and offer you

735
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:08,729
his mother's, his wife's and my
own thanks for coming here today.

736
01:29:11,099 --> 01:29:14,262
My heart is so full of grief that

737
01:29:16,938 --> 01:29:19,771
God gave me a father

738
01:29:20,675 --> 01:29:24,304
greater and better than most men.

739
01:29:26,448 --> 01:29:27,312
Father.

740
01:29:28,216 --> 01:29:30,241
You were such to me

741
01:29:30,919 --> 01:29:32,784
that all my days

742
01:29:34,122 --> 01:29:37,819
I ought to express it
in word and in deed.

743
01:29:39,594 --> 01:29:41,721
Now that you have passed away,

744
01:29:42,864 --> 01:29:45,298
I am tormented by the grief I caused you.

745
01:29:47,436 --> 01:29:49,301
If you were alive now

746
01:29:49,971 --> 01:29:52,462
I would be a much better son to you.

747
01:29:57,446 --> 01:29:58,572
Forgive me

748
01:29:59,648 --> 01:30:03,550
for letting my feelings
have the better of me.

749
01:30:09,524 --> 01:30:11,617
One word more.

750
01:30:11,893 --> 01:30:14,919
A word, on behalf of the relatives.

751
01:30:19,901 --> 01:30:25,032
According to custom,
I bear witness before God and man

752
01:30:25,807 --> 01:30:28,332
that my father's sudden death

753
01:30:28,543 --> 01:30:31,205
can be laid at the door
of no man or woman.

754
01:30:45,494 --> 01:30:49,931
His wife was with him
when Death came for him.

755
01:30:50,999 --> 01:30:56,027
And his mother and I were
with him when he expired.

756
01:31:14,422 --> 01:31:19,121
Let us bless him who lies here.

757
01:31:21,129 --> 01:31:25,964
Wait. I will speak now!

758
01:31:31,273 --> 01:31:37,178
If his son will not tell the truth,
then his mother must.

759
01:31:47,856 --> 01:31:51,587
My son lies on his coffin murdered.

760
01:31:52,327 --> 01:31:55,296
And she who murdered him

761
01:31:55,497 --> 01:31:57,488
sits there!

762
01:31:58,934 --> 01:32:02,665
I claim a life for a life.

763
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,903
Don't believe her. I answer for his wife.
She is not responsible.

764
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:13,680
Every word I have said is true.

765
01:32:16,718 --> 01:32:19,152
Believe me. Would I let my father
lie unavenged if...

766
01:32:19,354 --> 01:32:22,152
Yes, you would.

767
01:32:23,992 --> 01:32:27,257
For you are under her spell yourself.

768
01:32:28,597 --> 01:32:31,623
With the aid of
the Evil One she ensnared you.

769
01:32:32,267 --> 01:32:36,431
With the aid of the Evil One
she killed her husband.

770
01:32:36,838 --> 01:32:39,398
I denounce her as a witch.

771
01:32:39,874 --> 01:32:42,968
Let her deny it if she dares.

772
01:32:46,081 --> 01:32:50,177
<i>Gentlemen,
let's look into this matter.</i>

773
01:32:58,493 --> 01:33:00,723
<i>With the aid of the Evil One?</i>

774
01:33:28,189 --> 01:33:29,918
You heard the accusation.

775
01:33:34,095 --> 01:33:36,586
So that the full truth may be known.

776
01:33:36,798 --> 01:33:38,060
I demand...

777
01:33:38,466 --> 01:33:41,162
That you lay your hand upon the dead

778
01:33:41,503 --> 01:33:42,970
and take an oath.

779
01:33:57,852 --> 01:34:01,982
Are you ready and willing
for such a test?

780
01:34:24,045 --> 01:34:25,069
I swear.

781
01:34:27,348 --> 01:34:31,910
I testify... I testify...

782
01:34:45,433 --> 01:34:47,628
So you have your revenge.

783
01:34:49,871 --> 01:34:52,840
I killed you

784
01:34:53,608 --> 01:34:55,701
with the Evil One's help.

785
01:34:57,345 --> 01:34:59,677
And with the Evil One's help

786
01:35:00,615 --> 01:35:01,843
I lured

787
01:35:02,217 --> 01:35:05,015
your son into my power.

788
01:35:09,157 --> 01:35:13,355
Now you know. Now you know.

789
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:28,776
I see through my tears,

790
01:35:31,045 --> 01:35:33,445
but no one comes

791
01:35:33,982 --> 01:35:35,973
to wipe them away.

792
01:36:08,650 --> 01:36:11,244
Day of Wrath, for pity take

793
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:16,118
My sins away from Satan's grasp

794
01:36:16,524 --> 01:36:20,153
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

795
01:36:20,662 --> 01:36:23,654
Day of Wrath, hear our bidding,

796
01:36:24,365 --> 01:36:27,766
Sorrowful, heavenly flood of tears,

797
01:36:28,269 --> 01:36:32,137
Save us, Jesus, with your blood.

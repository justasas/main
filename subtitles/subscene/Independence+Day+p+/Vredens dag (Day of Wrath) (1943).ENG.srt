1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:21,854
DAY OF WRATH

2
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,576
Day of Wrath, dreadful night,

3
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:28,494
Heaven and earth in ashes burning,

4
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,265
And the sun beset by dead of night.

5
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:35,835
That Day of Wrath, that sulfurous day

6
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,971
When flaming heavens together roll,

7
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,809
And earth's beautiful castle shall pass away.

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,212
Day of Wrath, when we shall

9
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:49,588
Awake from clay to judgment

10
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:52,852
And be brought to our enchanted hour.

11
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,522
Day of Wrath, the mighty trumpet's tone

12
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:59,992
Calls forth the living and the dead

13
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:05,198
And shall rend each tomb's sepulchral stone.

14
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,260
Day of Wrath, by God unleashed,

15
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,504
Behold Satan's ghastly abacus

16
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,566
Shown before the Judge's gaze.

17
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,743
The Day of Wrath, that judgment day,

18
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,158
Then shall be heard with universal dread

19
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,936
The sins revealed as they are read.

20
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:27,169
Day of Wrath, O, see them stand

21
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,897
Before His Throne, small and grim,

22
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,761
Clad in shame and rancid sin.

23
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,625
Day of Wrath, for pity take

24
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:38,836
My sins away from Satan's grasp

25
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,217
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

26
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,474
And whereas the said Herlof's Marte

27
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:51,010
is denounced as a witch

28
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:53,913
by three respected and worthy citizens,

29
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,849
we rule that she be seized

30
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,683
and brought before the Court.

31
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,101
If only it helps!

32
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,474
It is sure to.
They're herbs from under the gallows!

33
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:29,046
It's strange they have so much power.

34
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,623
There is power in Evil!

35
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,619
Who are they hunting now?

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,648
She'll be put on the stake,

37
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,017
She'll be put on the stake

38
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,252
And shall burn. And burn

39
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,421
With smoldering flesh

40
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,123
She'll be put on the stake,

41
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:46,258
She'll be put on the stake

42
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,828
And shall burn. And burn

43
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,621
With smoldering flesh

44
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,388
Open up. Open up, Herlof's Marte

45
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,862
Put these away.

46
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,203
Absalon, Martin should be here soon.

47
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:09,739
The ship has just come in.

48
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,774
I'll be there right away.

49
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:23,731
Have you the key to the loft?

50
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,232
May I have it?

51
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,237
In this house

52
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,413
I carry the keys.

53
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,046
I am Absalon's wife.

54
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:42,049
But I am his mother.

55
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:55,194
It is not easy for an old dog
to learn new tricks.

56
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,324
Nor is it easy for a young wife

57
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,929
to come into an old household.

58
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,571
You are too hard on her.

59
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,808
I want her to be a good wife to you.

60
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,104
She is.

61
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:22,248
When your first wife was alive...

62
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:25,193
She is not alive anymore.

63
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:29,236
No, but her son is alive.

64
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,071
And now he's coming home...

65
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,999
home to a new mother

66
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:42,368
many years younger than he.

67
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,122
What does it matter?

68
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,957
Matter?

69
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:50,361
I think it is... scandalous.

70
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,519
I'm going out to meet Martin.

71
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,006
Is Master Absalon at home?

72
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,440
No, he has gone to meet his son.

73
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,457
I am his son.

74
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,739
Are you his son?

75
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,597
Are you his wife?

76
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,758
It seems I've seen your face before.

77
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,944
Where would that have been?

78
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,093
Perhaps in my thoughts.

79
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,974
I have thought about you
many, many times...

80
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:29,457
wondering what you would say
to so young a mother.

81
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:33,379
I promise to be a good son to you!

82
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,677
Yes... you are my son now.

83
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,637
And you, my mother.

84
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,147
My grown son.

85
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,690
What is keeping father?

86
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,843
Here comes father now.

87
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,871
Anne, shall we surprise him?
I'll hide.

88
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,967
Didn't Martin come with you?

89
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,785
Hasn't he come yet?

90
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,887
He'll be here soon.

91
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:16,876
Yes, he probably will.

92
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:36,363
What's this?
It's Martin's songbook.

93
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,363
Here is the song of
the Maiden and the Apple Tree.

94
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,833
A Maiden

95
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:49,088
sat in an apple tree high.
A lad chanced to pass by.

96
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,590
She stretched, the bough it bent.

97
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,998
Within his arms she landed.

98
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:15,478
This is so nice. Don't you want
to give your mother a kiss?

99
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,490
Shall we go to my study?

100
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,786
Yes, father.

101
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,511
You're bleeding!

102
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,670
It's nothing.

103
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,781
You must help me, hide me!

104
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,945
They will burn me if they catch me!

105
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,107
Have they denounced you as a witch?

106
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,907
I helped your mother.

107
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,465
She too was denounced as a witch.

108
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,543
My mother? It's not true.

109
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,311
It is true! She was set free

110
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:54,719
only because you were her daughter.

111
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:00,617
You cannot send me out to my death...

112
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:04,379
Get firewood for the oven.

113
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,299
And Bente, clean the fish.

114
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,778
Where are you going?

115
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,013
Nowhere.

116
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,461
Is that cupboard to remain open?

117
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,025
Grandmother. Grandmother.

118
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:15,688
Why are you so quiet, Anne?

119
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,675
We are looking for Herlof's Marte.

120
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,207
Here?

121
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,859
In the rectory?

122
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:35,689
Some children saw her come in here.

123
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,791
But that is impossible... then we must...

124
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,928
Have you seen Herlof's Marte?

125
00:13:53,833 --> 00:14:00,807
If she is here, she must have sneaked in...
Yes, look for her.

126
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,562
Bloodstains... Over here.

127
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,607
Is there another entrance to the loft?

128
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,816
Yes, by the other staircase.

129
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,418
Tell Hans and Henrik to go up that way.

130
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,046
The Lord have mercy upon us!

131
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,780
And this should have been a day of joy!

132
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,469
I order that the Notary of the Chapter

133
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,938
the Reverend Absalon Pederssøn

134
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,841
take the said Herlof's Marte
to confession.

135
00:15:42,842 --> 00:15:46,211
He shall diligently exhort her
to confess the full truth

136
00:15:46,212 --> 00:15:50,543
that she may not die without
penance, but her soul be saved.

137
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,793
Help me, Absalon.
Save me from the stake.

138
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:10,057
Only God can help you.

139
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,555
You can. If you want.

140
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:26,912
I ask only that you do for me
what you did for Anne's mother.

141
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:28,169
What do you mean?

142
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,302
You spared her.

143
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,051
Do not say more than you can answer for.

144
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,739
I know what I say.

145
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,260
You knew she was a witch,
but you kept silent...

146
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:40,574
You lie!

147
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,760
You kept silent for Anne's sake.

148
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,198
Come here.

149
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:12,961
Kneel.

150
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,330
I'm begging for my life.

151
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:23,355
You shall not beg for your life.
You should pray for your soul.

152
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,827
Confess the truth.

153
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,994
What shall I confess?

154
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,135
That you are a witch.

155
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:45,790
A witch? I knew of one...

156
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:50,540
She was Anne's mother,
and you set her free.

157
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,270
Be quiet.

158
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,755
I am so terribly afraid... to die.

159
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,653
Come with me.

160
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:46,217
Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning.

161
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:52,394
See fulfilled the prophet's warning

162
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:56,027
You're here.

163
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,663
I came to listen to the singing.

164
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:02,634
Day of Wrath that...

165
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,932
Day of Wrath...

166
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,976
Why are they learning that?

167
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,957
To sing when Herlof's Marte is burned.

168
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:16,014
I hear her screams all the time.

169
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,979
Come, let's go.

170
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:26,415
Oh what fear man's soul renders

171
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:33,075
When from Heaven the Judge descends.

172
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,114
The old one's giving in.

173
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,382
Will you confess?

174
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,528
Yes.

175
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:46,850
Finally.

176
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,140
Release her.

177
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:11,623
Thereafter she consented
to a confession.

178
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:37,725
Tell us how you entered
the service of the Evil One?

179
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,249
Answer!

180
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,823
So you will not confess...

181
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,659
She hasn't had enough.

182
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,109
I have.

183
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,711
Answer me then.

184
00:21:52,712 --> 00:21:54,897
Where did you first meet the Devil?

185
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,130
Under the gallows?

186
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,977
You had to trample on the cross?

187
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:03,668
He forbade you
to receive the Sacrament?

188
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,469
You had to abjure God and Christ

189
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:10,772
and sell your soul
to the Devil for eternity.

190
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,621
Have you anything more to confess?

191
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,447
No.

192
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:26,820
A fine confession!

193
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:32,030
She is difficult.

194
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,448
Ask her if she knows of others.

195
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:56,674
We haven't finished yet.
Do you know any other witches?

196
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,787
No.

197
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,511
Have you known any?

198
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,883
Is there anyone you can denounce?

199
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,530
She is dead now.

200
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:08,658
Who was she?

201
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,884
Who she was... who she was?

202
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,702
Well, who was she?
Give me her name.

203
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,390
I do not remember.

204
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:30,662
But I'll remember you!

205
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,605
How's that?

206
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:35,480
Send me to my death...

207
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,352
and yours will follow!

208
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,594
Your threats don't move me.

209
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,096
You'd better tell me her name.

210
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,901
I'll say no more.

211
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:59,466
I have said enough.

212
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,665
You better loosen your tongue...

213
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:19,718
That's enough.
I will speak to her myself.

214
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,367
Save me from the stake!

215
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:51,020
I know... you will stand by me.

216
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,393
I beseech Thee, O Lord,

217
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,801
that this woman may repent

218
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,185
and that she may turn to Thee

219
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,424
and seek her salvation.

220
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:12,232
Take courage... be strong.

221
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,066
Take her away.

222
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,389
Come with me.

223
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,197
She named no one?

224
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:13,346
Perhaps, put to the question again.

225
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:18,325
All will be made known
in God's own good time!

226
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,348
Herlof's Marte was subjected
to painful interrogation

227
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,919
after which she made
a full voluntary confession

228
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,055
in the presence of
the assembled clergy.

229
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:34,772
June 14, 1623
Absalon Pederssøn - Jørgen Ravn

230
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,632
Gathering firewood already?

231
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,447
No, wood for the stake.

232
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:43,259
I have come to prepare you...
for death.

233
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,756
So you have failed me.

234
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,093
No, I have not failed you.

235
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:53,570
I have thought of you
these many days.

236
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:59,034
How I could secure for you...
Life Eternal.

237
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,305
Stop all your prattle.

238
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,976
I fear neither Heaven nor Hell.
I am only afraid to die.

239
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,194
I spared Anne.

240
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:13,417
And you fail me.

241
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,786
No, Marte.

242
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:18,144
But it is not too late.

243
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:22,513
Anne shall suffer as I suffer.

244
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:29,057
If I burn at the stake, so shall Anne.

245
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,996
No, no...

246
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:42,182
If they burn me...
If they burn me...

247
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:47,712
I don't want to be burned.
I don't want to.

248
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:56,850
I don't want to.

249
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,436
Go.

250
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:12,874
Go! Get out!

251
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,004
She'll be put on the stake,

252
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,306
She'll be put on the stake

253
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,375
And shall burn. And burn

254
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,940
With smoldering flesh

255
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:51,249
She'll be put on the stake,

256
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,551
She'll be put on the stake

257
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,087
And shall burn. And burn

258
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:59,529
With smoldering flesh.

259
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,504
Are you leaving?

260
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,531
I cannot stand this.

261
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,509
Stay here with me.

262
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:42,654
I want to speak to Absalon!

263
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:43,833
What for?

264
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,167
I want to speak to Absalon!

265
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,196
Do you want to denounce someone?

266
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,227
I want to speak to Absalon.

267
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,631
The condemned would like
to speak to you.

268
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,613
Free me from the stake.
Otherwise...

269
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:39,917
Have no fear.
The Lord is merciful.

270
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:44,249
He will open your eyes
and turn your soul from sin.

271
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,422
I will denounce Anne,
do you hear me!

272
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,797
You'll suffer for this!

273
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:10,448
The Devil will get you,
you hypocrite, you liar!

274
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,433
You liar. You liar. You liar.

275
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:25,329
Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning

276
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,202
See fulfilled the prophet's warning

277
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:37,522
Heaven and earth in ashes burning

278
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,453
Oh what fear man's soul renders

279
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:52,089
When from Heaven the Judge descends

280
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:58,985
On whose sentence all depends

281
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,536
Wondrous sounds the trumpet sings

282
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:09,974
On this beauteous day,
Herlof's Marte was successfully

283
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,919
burned at the stake.
Glory be to God.

284
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:41,205
Lord, I beseech Thee with all my heart,

285
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,675
help me in my hour of need!

286
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:51,382
I have been a faithful servant,
and have kept Thy commandments.

287
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:55,019
Yet now my innermost soul
is shaken by gnawing doubt.

288
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:58,022
O Lord,
let thy light shine upon me...

289
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:07,417
that I may find my way out
of this terrible darkness.

290
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,449
Do you want something?

291
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:27,697
Yes.

292
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,387
Something is tormenting you.

293
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:48,021
What is it? Tell your mother.

294
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:55,666
Mother, I have sinned.

295
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,539
Sinned against God.

296
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,821
I have lied to Him.

297
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:12,763
How? Tell me.
I'm your mother, aren't I?

298
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:15,446
Yes.

299
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:21,136
But this is a fight I must fight alone.

300
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:55,911
You've changed since
Herlof's Marte was arrested.

301
00:37:55,974 --> 00:38:00,461
And now she has burned at the
stake. You've become so strange.

302
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,224
Did she...

303
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:16,515
denounce another?

304
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,527
And you're keeping it secret?

305
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:23,767
She denounced no living person.

306
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:30,087
No living person?
No one living.

307
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:45,753
Have you ever looked into
Anne's eyes?

308
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,821
Have you seen how they burn?

309
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,807
I am thinking of her mother.

310
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,839
Her eyes burned in the same way.

311
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,511
Why are you saying this?

312
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,643
The day may come when you must
choose between...

313
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,136
Between what?

314
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:11,482
Between God and Anne.

315
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,983
You say that because you hate Anne.

316
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:22,689
No, out of love to you!

317
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,250
Goodnight, Grandmother.

318
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,177
Goodnight, Martin.

319
00:40:17,782 --> 00:40:18,894
Goodnight.

320
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,958
Goodnight, father.

321
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:44,205
Goodnight, my son.

322
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:09,670
Anne, there is something
we must discuss.

323
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:12,697
It concerns your mother.

324
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,608
My mother?

325
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,789
Is it that... that mother?

326
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:33,927
You know?

327
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:36,827
Yes... But is it true?

328
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,515
She confessed it.

329
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,701
What did she confess?

330
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,736
That she had the power of invocation.

331
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:52,376
She could call up
the Living and the Dead.

332
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:54,208
And they had to come.

333
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,747
If she wished someone dead,

334
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,279
he died.

335
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,368
Is it true you spared her
to marry me?

336
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,414
Do you blame me for that?

337
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:20,968
For being kind to mother? No.

338
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:22,551
But?

339
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,598
Were you also kind to me?

340
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,278
Have I not been a kind husband?

341
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,230
Yes, you have.
Did you ever ask me if I loved you?

342
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,453
You were so young,
just a child.

343
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:38,246
But did I love you?

344
00:42:39,157 --> 00:42:40,949
It is strange...

345
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:43,896
I never thought of that.

346
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:47,189
No, I suppose you haven't.

347
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:14,370
Absalon, hold me.
Hold me and make me happy.

348
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:30,062
I must look into myself.
I have much to speak to God about.

349
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,117
Goodnight, Anne.

350
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,850
Look into my eyes.

351
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,807
Your wonderful eyes.

352
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,362
So childlike.

353
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,848
Pure and clear...

354
00:44:05,777 --> 00:44:07,308
Goodnight.

355
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,445
How was it with my mother?

356
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,870
She could call
the Living and the Dead.

357
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,791
And they had to come.
Was that it?

358
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,818
Why do you ask?

359
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:33,878
I think it strange that...
with the power mother had...

360
00:44:37,108 --> 00:44:40,627
A human being can have such power...

361
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:50,113
I can do it. I can do it.

362
00:46:02,326 --> 00:46:05,701
Anne, you're crying.

363
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:12,656
I see you through my tears.

364
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:16,156
Tears that I wipe away.

365
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,848
No one has eyes like yours.

366
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,962
What are they like?

367
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,392
Childlike?

368
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,092
Pure and clear?

369
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:40,724
No, deep and mysterious.

370
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,278
But in their depths I see

371
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,641
a trembling, quivering flame

372
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:53,343
which you have kindled.

373
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,991
Let's go to the birches.

374
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,882
How happy I am!

375
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:45,358
Just to say "I love you".

376
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,939
And to know...

377
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,670
That you and I...

378
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,943
You were always in my thoughts.

379
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:59,553
And you in my dreams.

380
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,408
Here's the spring.

381
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,954
Come here.

382
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,761
More?

383
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,371
Water? No.

384
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,853
Of what then?

385
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,195
Drink.

386
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,496
Hear how they whisper.

387
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,136
It's the grass humming.

388
00:49:58,763 --> 00:50:00,411
Humming what?

389
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,950
A song about the two of us.

390
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,910
The song of your love.

391
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,784
And of yours.

392
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:17,998
Hold me tight. Make me happy.

393
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:26,990
...so that we may wander decently

394
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:32,512
and securely in the sight of God.

395
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:39,206
Through this Your most Holy Name. Amen.

396
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,475
May I read a little
from the Song of Songs?

397
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,464
Yes, please do.

398
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:54,584
I am the rose of Sharon,
and the lily of the valleys.

399
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:58,562
As the lily among thorns,
so is my love among the daughters.

400
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:03,402
As the apple tree among the trees
of the wood, so is my beloved.

401
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,453
I sat down under his shadow.

402
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,612
We have heard enough.

403
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,802
Will you stop it!

404
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,467
Wretched woman.

405
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,263
Grandmother?

406
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,114
I meant it.

407
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:45,834
Martin, what have we done to you?

408
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:49,532
You seem so far apart from us now.

409
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,555
Both from me and your father.

410
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,542
Promise me to think of your father

411
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:02,487
and do not cause him grief.

412
00:53:25,436 --> 00:53:26,809
Martin, would you help me?

413
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:28,590
Yes, of course.

414
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,623
Grandmother does not like you.

415
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,764
What does it matter -
if you like me?

416
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,996
If you love me.

417
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,191
Anne, how will this all end?

418
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,892
Kiss me.

419
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,626
Then I'll kiss you.

420
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:53,740
There you are.

421
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,660
Shut the door.

422
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:17,577
It's the first time I hear Anne laugh.

423
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,763
How she's changed.

424
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,700
Even her voice is different.

425
00:55:28,959 --> 00:55:32,400
Yes... she is changed.

426
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,507
When I see those two together

427
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:42,043
I feel for the first time how old I am...
And how young she is.

428
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,204
It is good Martin came home.

429
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:59,371
I will join them
and be young with the young.

430
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,364
It was nice to hear you laugh.

431
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,889
We were just going.

432
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:24,502
Where to?

433
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,837
To the river.

434
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:31,187
I wanted to ask you to read
through my sermon.

435
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:32,561
With pleasure, father.

436
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,964
Oh, can't it wait,
I had so looked forward to this.

437
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:40,797
I would be the last
to deprive you of any pleasure.

438
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:41,976
Go now.

439
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,034
It's the chaplain.

440
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,748
A message from Master Laurentius.

441
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,041
He is dying!

442
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,119
He asks you to come and prepare him.

443
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,035
I've brought the Holy Vessels.

444
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,769
I'm going.

445
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,458
How alive your hands are.

446
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:17,782
Your fingers.

447
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,535
Your wrist.

448
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,425
I can feel your pulse beating.

449
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:32,283
Beating for you.

450
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:38,080
The sun is coloring your cheeks.

451
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:41,103
Not the sun, happiness.

452
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:46,289
Happiness?
How long will it last?

453
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,977
Forever!

454
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,494
Anne, where will we end up?

455
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:54,019
Wherever the stream leads us!

456
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:56,008
One day.

457
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:59,003
Don't think about it.
So much can happen.

458
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,153
I see my father before me all the time.

459
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,394
I see only you.

460
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:21,317
Here I lie.

461
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:25,151
Soft and snug as in a mother's arms.

462
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,795
Herlof's Marte did not forget me.

463
01:00:32,796 --> 01:00:34,588
What do you mean?

464
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:37,989
She promised me death.

465
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:42,827
She deserved her punishment.

466
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,212
I suppose so.

467
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:03,095
Anne, let me go away.

468
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,399
Go away?

469
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,230
Yes, let's separate for a bit.

470
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:09,762
Separate?

471
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:14,153
Separate.

472
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,836
How could we two separate?

473
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:24,588
Think of all we've given to each other.

474
01:01:25,282 --> 01:01:26,852
Look at that tree.

475
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:29,419
Yes, it bows in sorrow.

476
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,441
No, in longing.

477
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,236
It grieves over us.

478
01:01:35,492 --> 01:01:38,514
It yearns after its own
reflection in the water.

479
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,534
As those two can never
be torn asunder.

480
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,028
Nor can we ever separate.

481
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:13,067
My body... is of this Earth.

482
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:16,298
And to the Earth I again submit it.

483
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:19,857
My soul... I have from God.

484
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:22,015
And unto God I surrender it.

485
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,516
Give me your hands.

486
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,592
Here, you have them.

487
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,744
That I may hold them

488
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,304
till mine grow cold.

489
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:44,994
It will not be long before I follow you.

490
01:02:44,995 --> 01:02:46,562
You seek to comfort me.

491
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:52,123
I often feel Death approaching.

492
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,572
But I go to meet it with courage.

493
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,065
And hope!

494
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:06,495
"Whosoever believeth shall live,
though he die."

495
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:11,309
If we could die... together, here.

496
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,922
Die? Die?

497
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:20,552
Why?

498
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,568
To atone for our sin.

499
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:26,521
Sin? Is it a sin to love?

500
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:32,408
Don't speak,
don't think anything except...

501
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,823
That we two belong together!

502
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:42,718
"As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood,

503
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:44,825
"so is my beloved..."

504
01:03:45,855 --> 01:03:48,877
"I sat down under his shadow..."

505
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,491
What weather!

506
01:03:58,101 --> 01:04:00,966
We will hear of some misfortune
after such a storm.

507
01:04:01,071 --> 01:04:04,250
Does one hear of anything else
these days?

508
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:11,975
Did you remember Absalon's beer?

509
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:14,717
No, I forgot.

510
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:50,619
Accept this body of Jesus
who gave you life

511
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,488
for you and your sins,

512
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:57,159
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

513
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:07,330
Accept this cup poured for you
as the covenant in his blood,

514
01:05:07,504 --> 01:05:12,789
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

515
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:28,752
No, you can't look.

516
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:30,726
Oh, let me.

517
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,208
Can you make it out?

518
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:36,570
A pear tree.

519
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:39,855
A pear tree!
Anyone can see it is an apple tree!

520
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,548
And here is an apple blossom.

521
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:43,725
Only one?

522
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,176
Yes, my apple tree has only
one blossom.

523
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,691
I hope Absalon won't come
across the bog.

524
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,480
If I knew the way he was coming,
I'd meet him.

525
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:12,468
If you go through the bog,
he may go around it.

526
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,727
And if you go round it,
he may walk through it.

527
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:21,610
You must understand. Anne
wants you to stay at home.

528
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:26,137
But Anne is right.
It is no use wandering about in the dark.

529
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:28,556
It is better to wait here for father.

530
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,853
Then we'll all wait.

531
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:41,008
You too?

532
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,346
Then I will go to bed.

533
01:06:53,243 --> 01:06:56,042
God have mercy on those at sea!

534
01:06:56,813 --> 01:06:58,880
And on those not at sea!

535
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:01,570
You are thinking of Absalon?

536
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:05,350
Yes. And of you!

537
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:39,804
There is nothing so quiet as
a heart that has ceased to beat.

538
01:07:59,042 --> 01:08:01,841
You should get yourself a wife.

539
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,046
There's no hurry.

540
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:15,290
There is no one in the world whom
I love as much as your father.

541
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:20,796
In him God gave me the son
I had longed for.

542
01:08:20,797 --> 01:08:24,055
And I shall defend him until
the day I lie in my grave.

543
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:34,818
Grandmother, why don't you like Anne?

544
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:38,881
I have never done her any harm
that I know of.

545
01:08:38,882 --> 01:08:40,374
But you don't like her?

546
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:50,361
No, I do not like her.

547
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,748
I hate her.

548
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,360
Father's wife.

549
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:57,065
The only grief your father ever
caused me

550
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,329
was bringing her into this house.

551
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:01,801
How can you talk like that?

552
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:04,882
Because it is the truth.

553
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,454
A small, innocent woman.

554
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,579
Innocent?

555
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:22,691
I've had my say.

556
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:30,991
I shall go to bed.

557
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:36,894
Goodnight, Martin.

558
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,605
May the Lord have you in His keeping!

559
01:11:26,049 --> 01:11:27,383
My Anne.

560
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:29,590
Yes, yours.

561
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:33,423
Yes... But my father's wife!

562
01:11:33,656 --> 01:11:37,214
Wife, yes - I never loved him.

563
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,674
Nor he me.

564
01:11:41,431 --> 01:11:43,144
Do you never think of him?

565
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:49,401
I often think, if he were dead...

566
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:50,978
Do you wish him dead?

567
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,527
I think only if he were dead.

568
01:12:00,817 --> 01:12:03,721
Are you ill, Master Absalon?

569
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,290
I felt as if Death had just brushed by me.

570
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:10,837
Death?

571
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:13,617
Yes, let's just go.

572
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,381
We will have a small house by the sea.

573
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,837
Every morning I shall wake...

574
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:26,548
my head on your shoulder.

575
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:30,508
With a kiss I'll wake you.

576
01:12:31,114 --> 01:12:33,548
Then we hear from his cradle

577
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,878
a little Martin crying.

578
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,424
I pick him up.

579
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:44,537
And as I found life at your breast

580
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:47,543
he'll find life at mine.

581
01:12:49,065 --> 01:12:51,933
The tenderness you gave to me

582
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:54,224
I give back to him.

583
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:57,392
While I hum for him

584
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,404
a song about us two.

585
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,117
Isn't it lovely to think about?

586
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:10,701
Yes. It is only a dream.

587
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:13,446
What does it matter?

588
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,520
So long as it is a beautiful dream?

589
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,617
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

590
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:45,758
No, we waited up for you,
Martin and I.

591
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:50,036
Good evening, Father.

592
01:13:50,059 --> 01:13:51,590
Good evening, Martin.

593
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:01,364
You were away a long time.

594
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,444
How is Master Laurentius?

595
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:08,996
God gave him a mild death.

596
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:19,287
Would you like some beer?
It's been near the fire.

597
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:26,118
Thank you for waiting up,
both of you.

598
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:39,144
Father, you are tired. You should rest.

599
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,184
I am tired.

600
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:44,079
But I don't think I can rest.

601
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:48,398
I come from a man

602
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,272
who died in piety.

603
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:55,254
But otherwise,

604
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:57,859
if I think of all the sighs

605
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:00,659
from other deathbeds I have sat by,

606
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:06,501
I see only sin... and sin... and sin.

607
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,726
The pleasure of the moment.

608
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:10,759
The secret sin.

609
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:13,842
Oh, Lord...

610
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:17,445
What lives men lead.

611
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:19,473
You speak so strangely.

612
01:15:22,251 --> 01:15:26,045
That is because I felt
a strange uneasiness.

613
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,691
Out there, earlier.

614
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,832
I felt as if Death held me by the hand.

615
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:35,630
I heard nothing.

616
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,776
I saw nothing.

617
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:42,737
But in my innermost soul I felt

618
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:46,375
my death had been decided.

619
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,346
You are tired.
You are ill.

620
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:54,334
I am not ill.
But I am tired.

621
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:56,770
Go to bed now.

622
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,754
Goodnight, my son. Sleep well.

623
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:13,011
I wish I could ease your heavy thoughts.

624
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:16,190
You have yours to think about.

625
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:40,489
You should not think so much of death.

626
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:45,927
You are right, Anne,
but I cannot get away from the thought.

627
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:50,650
My death has been decided!

628
01:16:50,906 --> 01:16:52,777
Who would want you dead?

629
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,297
Who would?

630
01:16:58,848 --> 01:17:02,642
Anne, have you never wished me dead?

631
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,019
Why should I?

632
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,580
Because

633
01:17:08,224 --> 01:17:10,448
I did you a great wrong.

634
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:17,154
I never asked you if you wished
to be mine... I took you.

635
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:20,698
I took your youth.

636
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:26,902
That is a wrong for which
I can never make amends.

637
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,855
Yes, it is true.

638
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:32,313
You took my youth.

639
01:17:32,615 --> 01:17:34,642
My joy.

640
01:17:36,552 --> 01:17:39,417
I burned for someone to love.

641
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,602
I dreamed

642
01:17:46,128 --> 01:17:49,647
of a little child to hold in my arms.

643
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:55,666
Not even that did you give me.

644
01:17:58,941 --> 01:18:02,120
You asked if I ever wished you were dead.

645
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:05,663
I have wished it hundreds of times.

646
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:11,667
I wished it when you were with me.

647
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:15,379
I wished it when you left me.

648
01:18:17,927 --> 01:18:23,064
But never did I wish it so hard
as since Martin and I...

649
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:24,699
Martin? And you.

650
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,538
Yes. Martin and I.

651
01:18:28,137 --> 01:18:29,629
Now you know.

652
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:34,622
Therefore, I now wish you dead.

653
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:36,436
Dead!

654
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:57,481
Father. Father.

655
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,495
What is it?

656
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:11,883
Shall I keep vigil now?

657
01:20:12,374 --> 01:20:16,285
No. Martin will keep vigil tonight.

658
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:25,539
Why are you so quiet?

659
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:27,923
Say something.

660
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,202
Did he know?

661
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:32,090
What do you mean?

662
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,807
Did he know that you and I...

663
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:39,003
You told him.

664
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,904
He knew.
That's why he called out to me.

665
01:20:42,905 --> 01:20:46,385
I am cold! Keep me warm!

666
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,632
I still hear his voice.

667
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,122
Father. Father.

668
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,427
Are you weeping for him?

669
01:21:02,258 --> 01:21:03,395
Or me?

670
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,194
For myself.

671
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:08,096
Why?

672
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:12,767
I wish I were dead.

673
01:21:14,136 --> 01:21:17,394
Everything, everything is over now.

674
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,320
No, Martin. It's only the beginning.

675
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:22,810
Not for me.

676
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:24,173
For us.

677
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,300
Why should he die?

678
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:31,889
I believe he died for our sake.

679
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:38,590
I am afraid for you.

680
01:21:40,029 --> 01:21:41,929
I am afraid for the one I love.

681
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,303
Are you going?

682
01:21:45,334 --> 01:21:47,283
Have you no thought for me?

683
01:21:48,971 --> 01:21:51,836
My only thought now is for him.

684
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,290
I'll stay and keep vigil.

685
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,581
Shall I keep vigil with you?

686
01:23:05,247 --> 01:23:07,576
No, I'd like to be alone.

687
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:15,334
You shun me.

688
01:23:17,226 --> 01:23:18,979
I shun mostly myself.

689
01:23:22,431 --> 01:23:26,604
We should be on our knees

690
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,112
asking his forgiveness.

691
01:23:30,372 --> 01:23:33,852
I don't need to ask
forgiveness for anything.

692
01:23:34,543 --> 01:23:37,643
But I know he would have forgiven us.

693
01:23:39,782 --> 01:23:41,916
He stands before God

694
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:43,251
and accuses us.

695
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:47,040
No, Martin.
He is interceding for us.

696
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,668
For he sees how we suffer.

697
01:24:14,183 --> 01:24:16,289
Do you remember what you said:

698
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,305
"If he were dead..."

699
01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:22,332
You wished him dead.

700
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:23,758
I only thought if.

701
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:25,702
You did wish him dead.

702
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:29,736
But did you wish, compel him to die?

703
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,379
Have you the power
to wish his death?

704
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:39,740
Answer me.

705
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,678
You are driving me to the stake.

706
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,181
Had you the power to wish his death?

707
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:50,551
Come to your senses. Martin!
I love you.

708
01:24:50,552 --> 01:24:53,574
I love you.
That's my only crime.

709
01:24:55,457 --> 01:24:56,949
You wished him dead.

710
01:24:56,959 --> 01:25:00,795
Don't make me crazy, Martin!
You must believe me!

711
01:25:00,796 --> 01:25:02,981
I am not the cause of his death.

712
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,922
Say it before his coffin.

713
01:25:17,646 --> 01:25:22,356
I am not the cause of his death.

714
01:25:26,889 --> 01:25:28,681
Do you believe me now?

715
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,396
Yes.

716
01:25:51,113 --> 01:25:55,247
Shall we ever find each other again?

717
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:57,522
Who could prevent it?

718
01:25:58,954 --> 01:25:59,987
The dead.

719
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:03,438
It's not the dead we should fear.

720
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:06,464
You mean Marte.

721
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:22,585
I love you.

722
01:26:23,078 --> 01:26:25,223
And you love me.

723
01:26:25,914 --> 01:26:27,941
We have sinned together.

724
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:30,518
And we must also stand together.

725
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:35,048
If Marte accuses me,

726
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:37,745
will you stand by me?

727
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:41,493
I promise.

728
01:26:41,997 --> 01:26:44,221
You'll not let go of me?

729
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:50,359
We are tied together so closely,
we can never be parted now.

730
01:26:53,108 --> 01:26:57,044
I believe happy days will come again.

731
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,949
Even if we cannot see them now.

732
01:29:06,274 --> 01:29:11,063
As the son and
heir of the dearly departed.

733
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,445
I stand here, by his coffin

734
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,884
and offer you

735
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:23,139
his mother's, his wife's and my
own thanks for coming here today.

736
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:28,330
My heart is so full of grief that

737
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,790
God gave me a father

738
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:38,442
greater and better than most men.

739
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:41,035
Father.

740
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:44,139
You were such to me

741
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:46,658
that all my days

742
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:51,968
I ought to express it in word and in deed.

743
01:29:53,188 --> 01:29:55,634
Now that you have passed away,

744
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:59,257
I am tormented by the grief I caused you.

745
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:03,174
If you were alive now

746
01:30:03,565 --> 01:30:06,430
I would be a much better son to you.

747
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,334
Forgive me

748
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:17,728
for letting my feelings
have the better of me.

749
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:25,486
One word more.

750
01:30:25,487 --> 01:30:28,967
A word, on behalf of the relatives.

751
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:39,396
According to custom,
I bear witness before God and man

752
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:42,136
that my father's sudden death

753
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:45,198
can be laid at the door
of no man or woman.

754
01:30:59,087 --> 01:31:04,190
His wife was with him
when Death came for him.

755
01:31:04,593 --> 01:31:10,375
And his mother and I were
with him when he expired.

756
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:33,420
Let us bless him who lies here.

757
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:40,283
Wait. I will speak now!

758
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:51,657
If his son will not tell the truth,
then his mother must.

759
01:32:01,449 --> 01:32:05,740
My son lies on his coffin murdered.

760
01:32:05,921 --> 01:32:09,089
And she who murdered him

761
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,380
sits there!

762
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:16,818
I claim a life for a life.

763
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:23,045
Don't believe her. I answer for his wife.
She is not responsible.

764
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,708
Every word I have said is true.

765
01:32:30,312 --> 01:32:32,947
Believe me. Would I let my father
lie unavenged if...

766
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:36,166
Yes, you would.

767
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:41,340
For you are under her spell yourself.

768
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,670
With the aid of
the Evil One she ensnared you.

769
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:50,431
With the aid of the Evil One
she killed her husband.

770
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:53,376
I denounce her as a witch.

771
01:32:53,468 --> 01:32:57,026
Let her deny it if she dares.

772
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:04,384
Gentlemen, let's look into this matter.

773
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:14,652
With the aid of the Evil One?

774
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:43,771
You heard the accusation.

775
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:50,391
So that the full truth may be known.

776
01:33:50,392 --> 01:33:51,843
I demand...

777
01:33:52,060 --> 01:33:55,095
That you lay your hand upon the dead

778
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:56,783
and take an oath.

779
01:34:11,446 --> 01:34:16,196
Are you ready and willing for such a test?

780
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:38,817
I swear.

781
01:34:40,942 --> 01:34:46,188
I testify... I testify...

782
01:34:59,027 --> 01:35:01,551
So you have your revenge.

783
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:06,879
I killed you

784
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,609
with the Evil One's help.

785
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:13,621
And with the Evil One's help

786
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:15,621
I lured

787
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:19,028
your son into my power.

788
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:27,578
Now you know. Now you know.

789
01:35:38,933 --> 01:35:42,884
I see through my tears,

790
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,399
but no one comes

791
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:49,865
to wipe them away.

792
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:25,226
Day of Wrath, for pity take

793
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:30,117
My sins away from Satan's grasp

794
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:34,254
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

795
01:36:34,255 --> 01:36:37,696
Day of Wrath, hear our bidding,

796
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:41,862
Sorrowful, heavenly flood of tears,

797
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:46,311
Save us, Jesus, with your blood.

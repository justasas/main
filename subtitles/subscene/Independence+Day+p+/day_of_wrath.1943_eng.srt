1
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:22,211
Day OF WRATH

2
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,821
Day of Wrath, dreadful night,

3
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,786
Heaven and earth in ashes burning,

4
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:32,496
And the sun beset by dead of night.

5
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,029
That Day of Wrath, that sulfurous Day

6
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:39,166
When flaming heavens together roll,

7
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,064
And earth's beautiful castle shall pass away.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,379
Day of Wrath, when we shall

9
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:49,748
Awake from clay to judgment

10
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:53,049
And be brought to our enchanted hour.

11
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,854
Day of Wrath, the mighty trumpet's tone

12
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,183
Calls forth the living and the dead

13
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:05,462
And shall rend each tomb's sepulchral stone.

14
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,461
Day of Wrath, by God unleashed,

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,735
Behold Satan's ghastly abacus

16
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,767
Shown before the Judge's gaze.

17
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,972
The Day of Wrath, that judgment Day,

18
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:21,313
Then shall be heard with universal dread

19
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,181
The sins revealed as they are read.

20
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,349
Day of Wrath, O, see them stand

21
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,152
Before His Throne, small and grim,

22
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,991
Clad in shame and rancid sin.

23
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,860
Day of Wrath, for pity take

24
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,026
My sins away from Satan's grasp

25
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,532
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

26
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,863
And whereas the said Herlof's Marte

27
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,407
is denounced as a witch

28
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,307
by three respected and worthy citizens,

29
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,244
we rule that she be seized

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,783
and brought before the Court.

31
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,406
If only it helps!

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,535
It is sure to.
They're herbs from under the gallows!

33
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:29,107
It's strange they have so much power.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,909
There is power in Evil!

35
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,920
Who are they hunting now?

36
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,038
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>,

37
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,410
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

38
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,643
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

39
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,821
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

40
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:44,512
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>,

41
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,658
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

42
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,225
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

43
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,987
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

44
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,713
<i>Open up. Open up, Herlof's Marte</i>

45
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,283
Put these away.

46
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,303
Absalon, Martin should be here soon.

47
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,100
The ship has just come in.

48
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,135
I'll be there right away.

49
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,986
Have you the key to the loft?

50
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,653
May I have it?

51
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,593
In this house

52
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,733
I carry the keys.

53
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,436
I am Absalon's wife.

54
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,304
But I am his mother.

55
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:55,180
It is not easy for an old dog
to learn new tricks.

56
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,717
Nor is it easy for a young wife

57
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,189
to come into an old household.

58
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,966
You are too hard on her.

59
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:16,198
I want her to be a good wife to you.

60
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,535
She is.

61
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,640
When your first wife was alive...

62
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,409
She is not alive anymore.

63
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,321
No, but her son is alive.

64
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,217
And now he's coming home...

65
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:38,220
home to a new mother

66
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,762
many years younger than he.

67
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,493
What does it matter?

68
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,328
Matter?

69
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,471
I think it is... <i>scandalous</i>.

70
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,670
I'm going out to meet Martin.

71
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,391
Is Master Absalon at home?

72
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,721
No, he has gone to meet his son.

73
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,862
I am his son.

74
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,134
Are you his son?

75
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,963
Are <i>You</i> his wife?

76
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,081
It seems I've seen your face before.

77
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,259
Where would that have been?

78
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,398
Perhaps in my thoughts.

79
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:24,125
I have thought about you
many, many times...

80
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:29,502
wondering what you would say
to so young a mother.

81
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,775
I promise to be a good son to you!

82
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,847
Yes... you are my son now.

83
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,008
And you, my mother.

84
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,483
My grown son.

85
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,031
What is keeping father?

86
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,065
Here comes father now.

87
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:07,207
Anne, shall we surprise him?
I'll hide.

88
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:11,378
Didn't Martin come with you?

89
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,176
Hasn't he come yet?

90
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,251
He'll be here soon.

91
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,217
Yes, he probably will.

92
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,403
What's this?
It's Martin's songbook.

93
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,448
Here is the song of
the Maiden and the Apple Tree.

94
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,274
A Maiden

95
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:49,443
sat in an apple tree high.
A lad chanced to pass by.

96
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,987
She stretched, the bough it bent.

97
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,284
Within his arms she landed.

98
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:15,104
This is so nice. Don't you want
to give your mother a kiss?

99
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,884
Shall we go to my study?

100
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,217
Yes, father.

101
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,932
You're bleeding!

102
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,966
It's nothing.

103
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,715
You must help me, hide me!

104
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,146
They will burn me if they catch me!

105
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,422
Have they denounced you as a witch?

106
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,258
I helped your mother.

107
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,761
She too was denounced as a witch.

108
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,773
My mother? It's not true.

109
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:52,699
It is true! She was set free

110
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,005
only because <i>You</i> were her daughter.

111
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,678
You cannot send me out to my death...

112
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,815
<i>Get firewood for the oven</i>.

113
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,585
<i>And Bente, clean the fish</i>.

114
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,230
Where are you going?

115
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:24,465
Nowhere.

116
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,846
Is that cupboard to remain open?

117
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:02,171
Grandmother. Grandmother.

118
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,984
Why are you so quiet, Anne?

119
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,967
We are looking for Herlof's Marte.

120
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,607
Here?

121
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,244
In the rectory?

122
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,944
Some children saw her come in here.

123
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,951
But that is impossible... then we must...

124
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,214
Have you seen Herlof's Marte?

125
00:13:54,433 --> 00:14:00,497
If she is here, she must have sneaked in...
Yes, look for her.

126
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,753
Bloodstains... Over here.

127
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,927
Is there another entrance to the loft?

128
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,131
Yes, by the other staircase.

129
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,694
Tell Hans and Henrik to go up that way.

130
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,236
The Lord have mercy upon us!

131
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:26,781
And this should have been a Day of joy!

132
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,862
I order that the Notary of the Chapter

133
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,334
the Reverend Absalon Pederssøn

134
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,235
take the said Herlof's Marte
to confession.

135
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,605
He shall diligently exhort her
to confess the full truth

136
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,578
that she may not die without
penance, but her soul be saved.

137
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:08,091
Help me, Absalon.
Save me from the stake.

138
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,362
Only God can help you.

139
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,826
You can. If you want.

140
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:27,011
I ask only that you do for me
what you did for Anne's mother.

141
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:28,605
What do you mean?

142
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,643
You spared <i>her</i>.

143
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,349
Do not say more than you can answer for.

144
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,119
I know what I say.

145
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,355
You knew she was a witch,
but you kept silent...

146
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,055
You lie!

147
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,956
You kept silent for Anne's sake.

148
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,639
Come here.

149
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,452
Kneel.

150
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,719
I'm begging for my life.

151
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,300
You shall not beg for your life.
You should pray for your soul.

152
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,142
Confess the truth.

153
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,379
What shall I confess?

154
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,476
That you are a witch.

155
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:45,948
A witch? I knew of one...

156
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:50,521
She was Anne's mother,
and you set her free.

157
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,730
Be quiet.

158
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,720
I am so terribly afraid... to die.

159
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:24,058
Come with me.

160
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:46,345
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning</i>.

161
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:52,188
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning</i>

162
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,492
You're here.

163
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,955
I came to listen to the singing.

164
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,030
<i>Day of Wrath that</i>...

165
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,102
<i>Day of Wrath</i>...

166
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,371
Why are they learning that?

167
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,303
To sing when Herlof's Marte is burned.

168
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,305
I hear her screams all the time.

169
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,275
Come, let's go.

170
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:26,250
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders</i>

171
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,825
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends</i>.

172
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,491
The old one's giving in.

173
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,772
Will you confess?

174
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,899
Yes.

175
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,310
Finally.

176
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,506
Release her.

177
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,568
Thereafter she consented
to a confession.

178
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,690
Tell us how you entered
the service of the Evil One?

179
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,690
Answer!

180
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,203
So you will not confess...

181
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,165
She hasn't had enough.

182
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,501
I have.

183
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,109
Answer me then.

184
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,212
Where did you first meet the Devil?

185
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,515
Under the gallows?

186
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,343
You had to trample on the cross?

187
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,044
He forbade you
to receive the Sacrament?

188
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,789
You had to abjure God and Christ

189
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,957
and sell your soul
to the Devil for eternity.

190
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,962
Have you anything more to confess?

191
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,893
No.

192
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,210
A fine confession!

193
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:32,415
She is difficult.

194
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,789
Ask her if she knows of others.

195
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:56,941
We haven't finished yet.
Do you know any other witches?

196
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:58,242
No.

197
00:22:58,777 --> 00:22:59,937
Have you known any?

198
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,174
Is there anyone you can denounce?

199
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:07,976
She is dead now.

200
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,118
Who was she?

201
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,789
Who she was... who she was?

202
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:25,002
Well, who was she?
Give me her name.

203
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,770
I do not remember.

204
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,003
But I'll remember you!

205
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,036
How's that?

206
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,876
Send me to my death...

207
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,708
and yours will follow!

208
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:40,945
Your threats don't move me.

209
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,351
You'd better tell me her name.

210
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,301
I'll say no more.

211
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,732
I have said enough.

212
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,980
You better loosen your tongue...

213
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:19,453
That's enough.
I will speak to her myself.

214
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,643
Save me from the stake!

215
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:51,081
I know... you will stand by me.

216
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,791
I beseech Thee, O Lord,

217
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,087
that this woman may repent

218
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,391
and that she may turn to Thee

219
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,734
and seek her salvation.

220
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:12,242
Take courage... be strong.

221
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,477
Take her away.

222
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,784
Come with me.

223
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,597
She named no one?

224
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,601
Perhaps, put to the question again.

225
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:18,331
All will be made known
in God's own good time!

226
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:23,743
Herlof's Marte was subjected
to painful interrogation

227
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:28,318
after which she made
a full voluntary confession

228
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,455
in the presence of
the assembled clergy.

229
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:34,887
June 14, 1623
Absalon Pederssøn - Jørgen Ravn

230
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,048
Gathering firewood already?

231
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,813
No, wood for the stake.

232
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,149
I have come to prepare you...
for death.

233
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,154
So you have failed me.

234
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:49,258
No, I have not failed you.

235
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:53,595
I have thought of you
these many Days.

236
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,960
How I could secure for you...
Life Eternal.

237
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,696
Stop all your prattle.

238
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,967
I fear neither Heaven nor Hell.
I am only afraid to die.

239
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,571
I spared Anne.

240
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:13,809
And you fail me.

241
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,077
No, Marte.

242
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,445
But it is not too late.

243
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:22,584
Anne shall suffer as I suffer.

244
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:29,027
If I burn at the stake, so shall Anne.

245
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,306
No, no...

246
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:42,142
If they burn me...
If they burn me...

247
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:47,708
I don't want to be burned.
I don't want to.

248
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,860
I don't want to.

249
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:08,797
Go.

250
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,109
Go! Get out!

251
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,400
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>,

252
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,698
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

253
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:44,772
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

254
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,206
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>

255
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,647
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>,

256
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,943
<i>She'll be put on the stake</i>

257
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,484
<i>And shall burn. And burn</i>

258
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,680
<i>With smoldering flesh</i>.

259
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,915
Are you leaving?

260
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,882
I cannot stand this.

261
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,875
Stay here with me.

262
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:42,689
I want to speak to Absalon!

263
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,293
What for?

264
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:46,523
I want to speak to Absalon!

265
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,596
Do you want to denounce someone?

266
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,563
I want to speak to Absalon.

267
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,951
The condemned would like
to speak to you.

268
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,003
Free me from the stake.
Otherwise...

269
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:40,310
Have no fear.
The Lord is merciful.

270
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,284
He will open your eyes
and turn your soul from sin.

271
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,657
I will denounce Anne,
do you hear me!

272
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,153
You'll suffer for this!

273
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:10,847
The Devil will get you,
you hypocrite, you liar!

274
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:15,383
You liar. You liar. You liar.

275
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:25,360
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning</i>

276
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:31,129
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning</i>

277
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:37,298
<i>Heaven and earth in ashes burning</i>

278
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,439
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders</i>

279
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:51,887
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends</i>

280
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,686
<i>On whose sentence all depends</i>

281
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,631
<i>Wondrous sounds the trumpet sings</i>

282
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:10,368
On this beauteous Day,
Herlof's Marte was successfully

283
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:13,135
burned at the stake.
Glory be to God.

284
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:41,532
<i>Lord, I beseech Thee with all my heart,</i>

285
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>help me in my hour of need!</i>

286
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:51,772
<i>I have been a faithful servant,</i>
<i>and have kept Thy commandments</i>.

287
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,419
<i>Yet now my innermost soul</i>
<i>is shaken by gnawing doubt</i>.

288
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,418
<i>O Lord,</i>
<i>let thy light shine upon me</i>...

289
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:06,792
<i>that I may find my way out</i>
<i>of this terrible darkness</i>.

290
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,875
Do you want something?

291
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,152
Yes.

292
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,658
Something is tormenting you.

293
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:48,027
What is it? Tell your mother.

294
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:55,611
Mother, I have sinned.

295
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,849
Sinned against God.

296
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,112
I have lied to Him.

297
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:13,157
How? Tell me.
I'm your mother, aren't I?

298
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,696
Yes.

299
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:21,197
But this is a fight I must fight alone.

300
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:55,801
You've changed since
Herlof's Marte was arrested.

301
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,476
And now she has burned at the
stake. You've become so strange.

302
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,624
Did she...

303
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,816
denounce another?

304
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:19,762
And you're keeping it secret?

305
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,126
She denounced no living person.

306
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:29,863
No living person?
No one living.

307
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,814
Have you ever looked into
Anne's eyes?

308
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,117
Have you seen how they burn?

309
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,127
I am thinking of her mother.

310
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,069
Her eyes burned in the same way.

311
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,836
Why are you saying this?

312
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:07,035
The Day may come when you must
choose between...

313
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,541
Between what?

314
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,647
Between God and Anne.

315
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,209
You say that because you hate Anne.

316
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:22,654
No, out of love to you!

317
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,666
Goodnight, Grandmother.

318
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:11,572
Goodnight, Martin.

319
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:19,349
Goodnight.

320
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:42,338
Goodnight, father.

321
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:44,605
Goodnight, my son.

322
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,290
Anne, there is something
we must discuss.

323
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,993
It concerns your mother.

324
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:15,060
My mother?

325
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,187
Is it that... that mother?

326
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,379
You know?

327
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,152
Yes... But is it true?

328
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,895
She confessed it.

329
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:42,096
What did she confess?

330
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,901
That she had the power of invocation.

331
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,775
She could call up
the Living and the Dead.

332
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,569
And they had to come.

333
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:57,138
If she wished someone dead,

334
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,679
he died.

335
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,598
Is it true you spared her
to marry me?

336
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,790
Do you blame me for that?

337
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,203
For being kind to mother? No.

338
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,006
But?

339
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,899
Were you also kind to me?

340
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,640
Have I not been a kind husband?

341
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,315
Yes, you have.
Did you ever ask me if I loved you?

342
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,785
You were so young,
just a child.

343
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,612
But did I love you?

344
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,315
It is strange...

345
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:44,156
I never thought of that.

346
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:47,390
No, I suppose you haven't.

347
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:14,050
Absalon, hold me.
Hold me and make me happy.

348
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:29,937
I must look into myself.
I have much to speak to God about.

349
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,512
Goodnight, Anne.

350
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,116
Look into my eyes.

351
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,057
Your wonderful eyes.

352
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,893
So childlike.

353
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,124
Pure and clear...

354
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:07,708
Goodnight.

355
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,811
How was it with my mother?

356
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,190
She could call
the Living and the Dead.

357
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,961
And they had to come.
Was that it?

358
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,189
Why do you ask?

359
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:33,833
I think it strange that...
with the power mother had...

360
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:40,768
A human being can have such power...

361
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:50,104
I can do it. I can do it.

362
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:05,861
Anne, you're crying.

363
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:12,862
I see you through my tears.

364
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,432
Tears that I wipe away.

365
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,114
No one has eyes like yours.

366
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,352
What are they like?

367
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:33,787
Childlike?

368
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,453
Pure and clear?

369
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:40,720
No, deep and mysterious.

370
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,559
But in their depths I see

371
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:50,767
a trembling, quivering flame

372
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,634
which <i>You</i> have kindled.

373
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,207
Let's go to the birches.

374
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,218
How happy I am!

375
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,458
Just to say "I love you".

376
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,329
And to know...

377
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:51,026
That you and I...

378
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,299
You were always in my thoughts.

379
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,873
And you in my dreams.

380
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,769
Here's the spring.

381
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,375
Come here.

382
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,192
More?

383
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:58,766
Water? No.

384
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,264
Of what then?

385
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,631
Drink.

386
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:56,852
Hear how they whisper.

387
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,526
It's the grass humming.

388
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,796
Humming what?

389
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:03,265
A song about the two of us.

390
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,165
The song of your love.

391
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,160
And of yours.

392
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:17,403
Hold me tight. Make me happy.

393
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,387
...so that we may wander decently

394
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:32,392
and securely in the sight of God.

395
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:39,000
Through this Your most Holy Name. Amen.

396
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,872
May I read a little
from the Song of Songs?

397
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,805
Yes, please do.

398
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,976
I am the rose of Sharon,
and the lily of the valleys.

399
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:58,643
As the lily among thorns,
so is my love among the daughters.

400
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:03,453
As the apple tree among the trees
of the wood, so is my beloved.

401
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,858
I sat down under his shadow.

402
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:07,958
We have heard enough.

403
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,257
Will you stop it!

404
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:30,808
Wretched woman.

405
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:36,709
Grandmother?

406
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,219
I meant it.

407
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,994
Martin, what have we done to you?

408
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,921
You seem so far apart from us now.

409
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,761
Both from me and your father.

410
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,765
Promise me to think of your father

411
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,703
and do not cause him grief.

412
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,230
Martin, would you help me?

413
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,961
Yes, of course.

414
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,023
Grandmother does not like you.

415
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,985
What does it matter -
if you like me?

416
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,396
If you love me.

417
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:59,462
Anne, how will this all end?

418
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,347
Kiss me.

419
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,977
Then I'll kiss <i>You</i>.

420
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,181
There you are.

421
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,096
Shut the door.

422
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:17,542
It's the first time I hear Anne laugh.

423
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,083
How she's changed.

424
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:27,885
Even her voice is different.

425
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:32,551
Yes... she is <i>changed</i>.

426
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,723
When I see those two together

427
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:41,798
I feel for the first time how old I am...
And how young she is.

428
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,475
It is good Martin came home.

429
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:59,377
I will join them
and be young with the young.

430
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,565
It was nice to hear you laugh.

431
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,074
We were just going.

432
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:24,977
Where to?

433
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,273
To the river.

434
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:31,581
I wanted to ask you to read
through my sermon.

435
00:56:31,788 --> 00:56:32,982
With pleasure, father.

436
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:36,124
Oh, can't it wait,
I had so looked forward to this.

437
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,063
I would be the last
to deprive you of any pleasure.

438
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,422
Go now.

439
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,434
It's the chaplain.

440
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,978
A message from Master Laurentius.

441
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,511
He is dying!

442
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,512
He asks you to come and prepare him.

443
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,516
I've brought the Holy Vessels.

444
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,154
I'm going.

445
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,749
How alive your hands are.

446
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,218
Your fingers.

447
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:25,961
Your wrist.

448
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:30,796
I can feel your pulse beating.

449
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,673
Beating for you.

450
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,476
The sun is coloring your cheeks.

451
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:41,309
Not the sun, happiness.

452
00:58:43,586 --> 00:58:46,680
Happiness?
How long will it last?

453
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,357
Forever!

454
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,887
Anne, where will we end up?

455
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,290
Wherever the stream leads us!

456
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,494
One Day.

457
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,224
Don't think about it.
So much can happen.

458
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:03,364
I see my father before me all the time.

459
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,774
I see only you.

460
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:21,541
Here I lie.

461
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:25,251
Soft and snug as in a mother's arms.

462
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,023
Herlof's Marte did not forget me.

463
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,954
What do you mean?

464
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,290
She promised me death.

465
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,963
She deserved her punishment.

466
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:46,664
I suppose so.

467
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:03,325
Anne, let me go away.

468
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:05,859
Go away?

469
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:08,622
Yes, let's separate for a bit.

470
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,162
Separate?

471
01:01:13,536 --> 01:01:14,594
Separate.

472
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:18,102
How could we two separate?

473
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,708
Think of all we've given to each other.

474
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,247
Look at that tree.

475
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,845
Yes, it bows in sorrow.

476
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,782
No, in longing.

477
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,612
It grieves over us.

478
01:01:36,092 --> 01:01:38,720
It yearns after its own
reflection in the water.

479
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,764
As those two can never
be torn asunder.

480
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,324
Nor can we ever separate.

481
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,218
My body... is of this Earth.

482
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:16,595
And to the Earth I again submit it.

483
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,993
My soul... I have from God.

484
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:22,335
And unto God I surrender it.

485
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,911
Give me your hands.

486
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:34,943
Here, you have them.

487
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,110
That I may hold them

488
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:40,650
till mine grow cold.

489
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:45,391
It will not be long before I follow you.

490
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:46,960
You seek to comfort me.

491
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:51,998
I often feel Death approaching.

492
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,967
But I go to meet it with courage.

493
01:02:57,173 --> 01:02:58,470
And hope!

494
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:06,310
"Whosoever believeth shall live,
though he die."

495
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:11,319
If we could die... together, here.

496
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,092
Die? Die?

497
01:03:19,896 --> 01:03:20,988
Why?

498
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,924
To atone for our sin.

499
01:03:23,366 --> 01:03:26,631
Sin? Is it a sin to love?

500
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:32,799
Don't speak,
don't think anything except...

501
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,978
That we two belong together!

502
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:43,114
"As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood,

503
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:45,150
"so is my beloved..."

504
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:49,083
"I sat down under his shadow..."

505
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:57,857
What weather!

506
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,192
We will hear of some misfortune
after such a storm.

507
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,435
Does one hear of anything else
these Days?

508
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:12,271
Did you remember Absalon's beer?

509
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:15,143
No, I forgot.

510
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:50,942
Accept this body of Jesus
who gave you life

511
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,881
for you and your sins,

512
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:57,150
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

513
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:07,065
Accept this cup poured for you
as the covenant in his blood,

514
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:12,700
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

515
01:05:28,057 --> 01:05:29,183
No, you can't look.

516
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,191
Oh, let me.

517
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:34,585
Can you make it out?

518
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:36,895
A pear tree.

519
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,061
A pear tree!
Anyone can see it is an apple tree!

520
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:42,868
And here is an apple blossom.

521
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:44,231
Only one?

522
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,341
Yes, my apple tree has only
one blossom.

523
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,926
I hope Absalon won't come
across the bog.

524
01:06:06,595 --> 01:06:08,756
If I knew the way he was coming,
I'd meet him.

525
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,797
If you go through the bog,
he may go around it.

526
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:15,902
And if you go round it,
he may walk through it.

527
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:21,976
You must understand. Anne
wants you to stay at home.

528
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:26,147
But Anne is right.
It is no use wandering about in the dark.

529
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,842
It is better to wait here for father.

530
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:34,253
Then we'll <i>all wait</i>.

531
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,463
You too?

532
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,762
Then I will go to bed.

533
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,277
God have mercy on those at sea!

534
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,210
And on those not at sea!

535
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:01,950
You are thinking of Absalon?

536
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,576
Yes. And of you!

537
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:39,588
There is nothing so quiet as
a heart that has ceased to beat.

538
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:02,076
You should get yourself a wife.

539
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:05,511
There's no hurry.

540
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,452
There is no one in the world whom
I love as much as your father.

541
01:08:15,891 --> 01:08:21,193
In him God gave me the son
I had longed for.

542
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:24,230
And I shall defend him until
the Day I lie in my grave.

543
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:34,908
Grandmother, why don't you like Anne?

544
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:39,281
I have never done her any harm
that I know of.

545
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:40,779
But you don't like her?

546
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:50,456
No, I do <i>not</i> like her.

547
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,089
I <i>hate</i> her.

548
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,760
Father's wife.

549
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,461
The only grief your father ever
caused me

550
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,634
was bringing <i>her</i> into this house.

551
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,201
How can you talk like that?

552
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,098
Because it is the truth.

553
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,774
A small, innocent woman.

554
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,005
Innocent?

555
01:09:20,923 --> 01:09:22,982
I've had my say.

556
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:31,396
I shall go to bed.

557
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,330
Goodnight, Martin.

558
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,736
May the Lord have you in His keeping!

559
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:27,809
My Anne.

560
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,011
Yes, yours.

561
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:33,549
Yes... But my father's wife!

562
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,350
Wife, yes - I never loved him.

563
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,050
Nor he me.

564
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,521
Do you never think of him?

565
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:49,501
I often think, if he were dead...

566
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,438
Do you wish him dead?

567
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,542
I think only <i>if</i> he were dead.

568
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,942
Are you ill, Master Absalon?

569
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:08,320
I felt as if Death had just brushed by me.

570
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,253
Death?

571
01:12:11,927 --> 01:12:13,918
Yes, let's just go.

572
01:12:16,265 --> 01:12:19,496
We will have a small house by the sea.

573
01:12:20,402 --> 01:12:22,233
Every morning I shall wake...

574
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:26,534
my head on your shoulder.

575
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:30,774
With a kiss I'll wake you.

576
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,944
Then we hear from his cradle

577
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:36,174
a little Martin crying.

578
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,780
I pick him up.

579
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,683
And as I found life at your breast

580
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,793
he'll find life at mine.

581
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:52,259
The tenderness you gave to me

582
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,525
I give back to him.

583
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:57,733
While I hum for him

584
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:00,670
a song about us two.

585
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:06,347
Isn't it lovely to think about?

586
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,746
Yes. It is only a dream.

587
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,851
What does it matter?

588
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,786
So long as it is a beautiful dream?

589
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,940
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

590
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:45,948
No, we waited up for you,
Martin and I.

591
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,452
Good evening, Father.

592
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:51,990
Good evening, Martin.

593
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,669
You were away a long time.

594
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:05,800
How is Master Laurentius?

595
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,241
God gave him a mild death.

596
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:19,477
Would you like some beer?
It's been near the fire.

597
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:25,827
Thank you for waiting up,
both of you.

598
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:39,335
Father, you are tired. You should rest.

599
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,574
I am tired.

600
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:44,370
But I don't think I can rest.

601
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,744
I come from a man

602
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,517
who died in piety.

603
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,654
But otherwise,

604
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,253
if I think of all the sighs

605
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:00,894
from other deathbeds I have sat by,

606
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:06,367
I see only sin... and sin... and sin.

607
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,036
The pleasure of the moment.

608
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,100
The secret sin.

609
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,238
Oh, Lord...

610
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,708
What lives men lead.

611
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:19,809
You speak so strangely.

612
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,150
That is because I felt
a strange uneasiness.

613
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:30,091
Out there, earlier.

614
01:15:30,292 --> 01:15:33,022
I felt as if Death held me by the hand.

615
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,963
I heard nothing.

616
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,096
I saw nothing.

617
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:43,036
But in my innermost soul I felt

618
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:46,501
my death had been decided.

619
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,606
You are tired.
You are ill.

620
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:54,309
I am not ill.
But I am tired.

621
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,141
Go to bed now.

622
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,019
Goodnight, my son. Sleep well.

623
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,196
I wish I could ease your heavy thoughts.

624
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,435
You have yours to think about.

625
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,785
You should not think so much of death.

626
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:45,827
You are right, Anne,
but I cannot get away from the thought.

627
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:50,931
My death has been decided!

628
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,133
Who would want you dead?

629
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,503
Who would?

630
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,747
Anne, have you never wished me dead?

631
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,310
Why should I?

632
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:07,985
Because

633
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,758
I did you a great wrong.

634
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:17,029
I never asked you if you wished
to be mine... I took you.

635
01:17:18,433 --> 01:17:20,924
I took your youth.

636
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:26,898
That is a wrong for which
I can never make amends.

637
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,175
Yes, it is true.

638
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:32,643
You took my youth.

639
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,978
My joy.

640
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:39,643
I burned for someone to love.

641
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:45,992
I dreamed

642
01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:49,788
of a little child to hold in my arms.

643
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:55,932
Not even that did you give me.

644
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:02,305
You asked if I ever wished you were dead.

645
01:18:02,744 --> 01:18:05,804
I have wished it hundreds of times.

646
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,878
I wished it when you were with me.

647
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,554
I wished it when you left me.

648
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:23,430
But never did I wish it so hard
as since Martin and I...

649
01:18:23,665 --> 01:18:25,098
Martin? And you.

650
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:27,768
Yes. Martin and I.

651
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,034
Now you know.

652
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:34,737
Therefore, I now wish you dead.

653
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:36,841
<i>Dead!</i>

654
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:57,661
Father. Father.

655
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,926
What is it?

656
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:12,203
Shall I keep vigil now?

657
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:16,375
No. Martin will keep vigil tonight.

658
01:20:24,386 --> 01:20:25,910
Why are you so quiet?

659
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:28,349
Say something.

660
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:30,648
Did he know?

661
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,490
What do you mean?

662
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,088
Did he know that you and I...

663
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,398
You told him.

664
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:43,093
He knew.
That's why he called out to me.

665
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,531
I am cold! Keep me warm!

666
01:20:47,008 --> 01:20:48,942
I still hear his voice.

667
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:52,338
Father. Father.

668
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:01,752
Are you weeping for him?

669
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:03,847
Or me?

670
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:06,620
For myself.

671
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:08,522
Why?

672
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:13,058
I wish I were dead.

673
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:17,569
Everything, everything is over now.

674
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,466
No, Martin. It's only the beginning.

675
01:21:22,377 --> 01:21:23,275
Not for me.

676
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:24,604
For us.

677
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,671
Why should he die?

678
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,119
I believe he died for our sake.

679
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:38,690
I am afraid for you.

680
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:42,324
I am afraid for the one I love.

681
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,724
Are you going?

682
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:47,629
Have you no thought for me?

683
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:52,062
My only thought now is for <i>him</i>.

684
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:25,605
I'll stay and keep vigil.

685
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,937
Shall I keep vigil with you?

686
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:07,872
No, I'd like to be alone.

687
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:15,750
You shun me.

688
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,350
I shun mostly myself.

689
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:26,660
We should be on our knees

690
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,463
asking his forgiveness.

691
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,998
I don't need to ask
forgiveness for anything.

692
01:23:35,143 --> 01:23:37,839
But I know he would have forgiven us.

693
01:23:40,382 --> 01:23:42,316
He stands before God

694
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,677
and accuses us.

695
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:47,150
No, Martin.
He is interceding for us.

696
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:49,988
For he sees how we suffer.

697
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,614
Do you remember what you said:

698
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,676
"If he were dead..."

699
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,683
You <i>wished</i> him dead.

700
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:24,184
I only thought <i>if</i>.

701
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:26,053
You <i>did</i> wish him dead.

702
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:29,887
But did you wish, <i>compel</i> him to die?

703
01:24:35,336 --> 01:24:37,634
Have you the power
to wish his death?

704
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:40,205
Answer me.

705
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:43,944
You are driving me to the stake.

706
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:47,407
Had you the power to wish his death?

707
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:50,945
Come to your senses. Martin!
I love you.

708
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:53,780
I love you.
That's my only crime.

709
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,354
You wished him dead.

710
01:24:57,559 --> 01:25:00,960
Don't make me crazy, Martin!
You must believe me!

711
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,296
I am not the cause of his death.

712
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,198
Say it before his coffin.

713
01:25:18,246 --> 01:25:22,342
I am not the cause of his death.

714
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,047
Do you believe me now?

715
01:25:29,924 --> 01:25:30,856
Yes.

716
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:55,308
Shall we ever find each other again?

717
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:57,878
Who could prevent it?

718
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:00,452
The dead.

719
01:26:01,356 --> 01:26:03,688
It's not the dead we should fear.

720
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:06,820
You mean Marte.

721
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:22,975
I love you.

722
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:25,543
And you love me.

723
01:26:26,514 --> 01:26:28,277
We have sinned together.

724
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,809
And we must also stand together.

725
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,384
If Marte accuses me,

726
01:26:36,357 --> 01:26:38,086
will you stand by me?

727
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:41,728
I promise.

728
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,531
You'll not let go of me?

729
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,360
We are tied together so closely,
we can never be parted now.

730
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:57,303
I believe happy Days will come again.

731
01:26:57,645 --> 01:27:00,170
Even if we cannot see them now.

732
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:11,038
As the son and
heir of the dearly departed.

733
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,671
I stand here, by his coffin

734
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:17,274
and offer you

735
01:29:17,485 --> 01:29:22,923
his mother's, his wife's and my
own thanks for coming here toDay.

736
01:29:25,293 --> 01:29:28,456
My heart is so full of grief that

737
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,965
God gave me a father

738
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:38,498
greater and better than most men.

739
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:41,505
Father.

740
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,435
You were such to me

741
01:29:45,113 --> 01:29:46,978
that all my Days

742
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:52,013
I ought to express it in word and in deed.

743
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:55,915
Now that you have passed away,

744
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,492
I am tormented by the grief I caused you.

745
01:30:01,629 --> 01:30:03,494
If you were alive now

746
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:06,656
I would be a much better son to you.

747
01:30:11,639 --> 01:30:12,765
Forgive me

748
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:17,743
for letting my feelings
have the better of me.

749
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:25,811
One word more.

750
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:29,113
A word, on behalf of the relatives.

751
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:39,226
According to custom,
I bear witness before God and man

752
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,526
that my father's sudden death

753
01:30:42,737 --> 01:30:45,399
can be laid at the door
of no man or woman.

754
01:30:59,687 --> 01:31:04,124
His wife was with him
when Death came for him.

755
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:10,221
And his mother and I were
with him when he expired.

756
01:31:28,616 --> 01:31:33,315
Let us bless him who lies here.

757
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:40,158
Wait. I will speak now!

758
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:51,371
If his son will not tell the truth,
then his mother must.

759
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:05,780
My son lies on his coffin murdered.

760
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,490
And she who murdered him

761
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:11,681
sits there!

762
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:16,858
I claim a life for a life.

763
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:23,096
Don't believe her. I answer for his wife.
She is not responsible.

764
01:32:24,972 --> 01:32:27,873
Every word I have said is true.

765
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:33,346
Believe me. Would I let my father
lie unavenged if...

766
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,346
Yes, you would.

767
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:41,450
For you are under her spell yourself.

768
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:45,816
With the aid of
the Evil One she ensnared you.

769
01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:50,624
With the aid of the Evil One
she killed her husband.

770
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,592
I denounce her as a witch.

771
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:57,162
Let her deny it if she dares.

772
01:33:00,274 --> 01:33:04,370
<i>Gentlemen, let's look into this matter</i>.

773
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:14,917
With the aid of the <i>Evil One?</i>

774
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:44,112
You heard the accusation.

775
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:50,780
So that the full truth may be known.

776
01:33:50,992 --> 01:33:52,254
I demand...

777
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:55,356
That you lay your hand upon the dead

778
01:33:55,696 --> 01:33:57,163
and take an oath.

779
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:16,176
Are you ready and willing for such a test?

780
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:39,263
I swear.

781
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:46,104
I testify... I testify...

782
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,822
So you have your revenge.

783
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:07,034
I killed you

784
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:09,895
with the Evil One's help.

785
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,871
And with the Evil One's help

786
01:35:14,809 --> 01:35:16,037
I lured

787
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,208
your son into my power.

788
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:27,548
Now you know. Now you know.

789
01:35:39,533 --> 01:35:42,969
I see through my tears,

790
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,639
but no one comes

791
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:50,166
to wipe them away.

792
01:36:22,843 --> 01:36:25,437
Day of Wrath, for pity take

793
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:30,311
My sins away from Satan's grasp

794
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:34,347
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

795
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,847
Day of Wrath, hear our bidding,

796
01:36:38,559 --> 01:36:41,960
Sorrowful, heavenly flood of tears,

797
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:46,331
Save us, Jesus, with your blood.

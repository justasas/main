00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,700
<i>For those who haven't read the plaque,
we'll read the plaque.</i>

2
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,650
<i>"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the moon."</i>

3
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>"July 1969."</i>

4
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,550
<i>"We came in peace for all mankind."</i>

00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
[<i>It's the End of the World</i> by R.E.M. playing]

5
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,000
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

6
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,800
Sir, I think you should listen to this.

8
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,100
- <i>Goddamn it!</i>
- Sir?

9
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
Sir?

10
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,950
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on!

11
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,600
This better not be another
damn Russian spy job!

12
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,150
Boys at air traffic say the skies are clear.

13
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,050
It's the real thing.

14
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
A radio signal from another world.

15
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,850
Let's not jump the gun here.

16
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,150
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know about...

17
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,150
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

18
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,900
Wait, wait, this can't be right.

19
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,750
The calculated distance from source

20
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,100
is only 375,000km.

21
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
It's coming from the moon.

22
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,500
Who else knows about this?

23
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,950
S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal.

24
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,750
But... they're even more
confused than we are, sir.

25
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
Excuse me.

26
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,950
Radar reception has been impaired,

28
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,200
but we were able to get these.

29
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,100
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km

30
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,600
and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

31
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,300
What the hell is it?

32
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
- A meteor?
- No, sir.

33
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,300
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?

34
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,550
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

35
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,800
- It's what?
- It's...

36
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,300
It's slowing down, sir.

37
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,100
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

38
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,350
Then wake him!

39
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,700
- Hello.
- <i>Hi.</i>

40
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,350
- It's me.
- <i>Hi.</i>

41
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,200
- <i>What time is it there?</i>
- It's 2:45 in the morning.

42
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,800
- <i>I know I didn't wake you.</i>
- As a matter of fact, you did.

43
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,600
Liar.

44
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,450
I have a confession to make.

45
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

46
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?</i>

47
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,500
- Did you?
- <i>Of course not.</i>

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,300
You're gonna come home
right after the luncheon, right?

48
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
- <i>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>
- Okay.

49
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,250
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

50
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,000
<i>Hi, honey!</i>

50
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,400
- Hi, I miss you.
- <i>I know. I miss you, too.</i>

51
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,700
<i>President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40%.</i>

52
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
- <i>Even his crime bill failed to pass.</i>
- He's good.

53
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,800
<i>Are the salad days over for
President Whitmore? More talk.</i>

54
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,200
<i>Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War is
completely different from leadership in politics.</i>

55
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,150
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

56
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,000
Traitor.

56
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,000
<i>That's the problem. They elected
a warrior and they got a wimp.</i>

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,450
- Good morning, George.
- Good morning, Mr. President.

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,200
That game couldn't have been pretty.

59
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,900
Thank you, sir.

60
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,700
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.

61
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,900
They're not attacking your policies.
They're attacking your age.

62
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,100
"Whitmore seems less like the president

63
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,800
"and more like the orphaned child, Oliver,

63
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,000
asking, 'Please, sir, I'd like some more.'"

64
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,650
- That's clever.
- Well, I'm not laughing.

65
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

66
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,800
- You were thought of as young, idealistic...
- Thanks.

67
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,650
Now, the message has gotten lost.

68
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,800
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,200
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

70
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,600
It's a fine line between standing behind
a principle and hiding behind one.

71
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,850
You can tolerate a little compromise,

72
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,350
if you're actually managing
to get something accomplished.

73
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,200
Well...

74
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,100
The 'Orange County Dispatch' has voted you
one of the ten sexiest men of the year.

75
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,600
That's...

76
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,100
That's accomplishing something.

77
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,050
Excuse me, Mr. President.
It's the Secretary of Defense.

78
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,800
Yes.

79
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,450
Could you say that again?

82
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,000
So, what are you waiting, hmm?

83
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,500
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

84
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,000
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

85
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,900
Do you have any idea how long
it takes for those cups to decompose?

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
If you don't move soon,
I'm gonna start decomposing.

88
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,750
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

89
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,500
- It's nice that you see me so much now, but--
- Don't start, Dad.

90
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,250
I'm only saying it's been... What? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

91
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,550
- Three years.
- All right, three, four.

92
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,150
You're divorced. Come on, move on.
This is not healthy.

93
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,400
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

94
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Checkmate.

95
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait a minute.

96
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,700
- Wait a minute. This is not checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

97
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,950
Just hold on! This is not checkmate.

98
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,500
Oh, checkmate!

99
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,850
Yes, we've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

100
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,150
Yeah, I love 'X-Files', too.
I hope you get to see it.

101
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,200
David! David!

102
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:34,050
What's the hell's the point of having
a beeper, if you're not gonna turn it on?

103
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.
Hello!

104
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,450
What's the... What's the big emergency?

105
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,400
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

106
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
We got static, we got snow,
all kinds of distortions.

107
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,800
- Marty!
- Nobody knows...

108
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,700
What the hell are you doing? There's a
reason we have bins labeled "Recycle"!

109
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,600
What the hell is going on?!
My God in heaven!

110
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,850
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Did you try to switch transponder channels?

112
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked,
if it was something simple?

113
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,850
Okay, let's point the dish at another satellite.

114
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,550
We tried that. It didn't work.

115
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,900
It's almost as though they weren't even there.

116
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,350
All right. What have we got here?

117
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,600
This is impossible.

118
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,900
<i>We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...</i>

119
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,000
The signal's all screwed up.

120
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,450
Stop it! Just leave it alone.
You'll break it, all right?

121
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,750
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

122
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,200
Oh, no!

123
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,850
Good morning, Lucas.

124
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You see these?
I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

125
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,900
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes,

126
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm getting someone else.

127
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,100
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

131
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,700
Russell! What are you doing?

132
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,700
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

134
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,850
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

135
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,250
Lucas' farm's on the other side of town!

136
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,500
Are you sure?

137
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,000
CNS is running a story that we're covering up
some type of nuclear-testing experiment.

138
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,800
Tell them to run with it,
if they want to embarrass themselves.

139
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,050
NASA's been on my butt all morning.
They want to know our position.

140
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,300
Our official position is...

141
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,250
we have no official position.

142
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,250
- Connie!
- What is going on here?

143
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

144
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,050
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

145
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,900
What? I can't hear you.

146
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,900
At the moment our satellites
are somewhat unreliable.

147
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,050
Isn't it possible that this thing
may just pass us by?

148
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
What if it doesn't pass us by?

149
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,750
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it out of the sky?

150
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,500
And risk turning one dangerous
falling object into many?

151
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,000
We don't yet know enough
about what we're dealing with

151
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,700
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

152
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,750
Luckily the press is making up
their own story at this point.

153
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,100
But that's not gonna keep.

154
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,100
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

155
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,700
General, contact NORAD. You tell them
we've upgraded to DEFCON 3.

155
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,900
That's not what the president said.

156
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
- Don't you think that's a little premature?
- I don't think so.

157
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,900
We have over 50% of the armed forces
out on weekend leave.

158
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,600
Not to mention the commanders and troops
that are in town for the 4th of July parade.

159
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,700
Go ahead, Commander.

159
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,500
Our intelligence tells us the object
has settled into a stationary orbit.

160
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,400
- Well, that's good news.
- Not really, sir.

161
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen other pieces.

162
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,250
Smaller than the whole, sir.

163
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,900
Yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

164
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,600
Where are they heading?

165
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,100
They should be entering our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

166
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Take us to DEFCON 3.

167
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,400
- Please tell me we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, there's good news and there's bad news.

168
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,200
All right. What's the bad news?

169
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,600
The bad news is there's no penalty
for disturbing my lunch.

170
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.

171
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,600
No. The good news is that I found
the problem. It's not our equipment.

172
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,800
It's some kind of weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

173
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
Wait, and that's the good news?

174
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,100
Yeah, 'cause this signal
has a definite sequential pattern.

174
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,000
So, as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

175
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,800
then I can calculate the phase reversal
with that analyser I bought for your birthday

175
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
and apply it,

176
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
we should be able to block it out completely.

177
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,000
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!

178
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,150
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, David!
That's why I love you!

179
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,450
- Oh! That's not necessary.
- Yes!

180
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,350
- Too kind.
- Yes!

181
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,000
- This better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

182
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,250
Sir, we're looking at a total
radar blackout over a 13km area.

183
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,800
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

184
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,000
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

185
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,950
Jeez!

186
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,100
Get me Atlantic Command on the line.

187
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,600
Hang on, sir.

188
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,150
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

189
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Second sighting?

190
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,950
Yes, sir. This just came in
from the Persian Gulf.

191
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
Correction, sir.

192
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,700
- <i>We now have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>
- Affirmative.

193
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,650
Mr. President, they're tracking
another one off the California coastline!

194
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,500
All right, go ahead, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes, sir. I got this.

195
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,550
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are
interrupting our regular broadcast</i>

196
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,600
<i>to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>

197
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,450
<i>This unexplained disturbance and the
hysteria that is causing are incredible.</i>

198
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,600
<i>How would you describe
what you are seeing?</i>

199
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,750
<i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly</i>

200
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,100
<i>to be a comet or meteor.</i>

201
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,800
<i>Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside</i>

202
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:44,450
<i>as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>

203
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i>

204
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Mr. President, we have an AWAC
off the West Coast.

205
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,200
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

206
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,950
I don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

207
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,600
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering!

208
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,800
Negative. We have zero visibility.
Visibility is at zero.

209
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:09,300
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

210
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,600
Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

211
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,950
<i>We still have zero visibility.</i>

212
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,150
<i>Instrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>

213
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,050
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.</i>

214
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

215
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,550
<i>It may be clearing.</i>

216
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,750
Pull out! Pull out!

217
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,100
Line's gone, sir.

217
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,900
Two more've been spotted over the Atlantic.

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,300
One's moving toward New York,
the other's headed this direction.

219
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,500
- How much time do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

220
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,250
Alex, organize a military escort.

221
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,900
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we move you to a secure location immediately.

222
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,700
Connie, can we expect the same
kind of panic we saw in Russia?

222
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
More than likely.

223
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Mr. President, we can discuss this
on the way.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm not leaving.

224
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,500
We have to maintain a working
government in a time of crisis.

225
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,700
I want you to take the president,
the whole cabinet, and the joint chiefs

225
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,400
and take them to a secured location.

226
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,700
I'm staying.

227
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,750
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

228
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,200
- Connie...
- Yes, sir.

228
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,550
We'll initiate the emergency
broadcast system.

229
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,750
We'll advise people not to panic.

230
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,950
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

231
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,900
- Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?
- Alex, contact the cabinet members,

232
00:18:37,00 --> 00:18:39,000
have them rendez-vous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

233
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,300
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

234
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
I had a feeling you would.

235
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,550
And what happens
if they do become hostile?

236
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,800
Then God help us.

237
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,550
<i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>

238
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,900
<i>It is apparently what has been causing
all the distortions in our broadcasts.</i>

239
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,500
David, are you watching this?

240
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,350
<i>And that's no evidence these
phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>

241
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,650
<i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i>

242
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,900
Marty, listen to this.

242
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,500
I got a lock on the pattern of that signal
and so we can filter it out.

243
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
But if my calculations are right, it's gonna
be gone in, like, seven hours anyway.

244
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,500
It's reducing itself every time it recycles,

245
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,650
so eventually it's gonna disappear...

246
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,200
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,500
David, haven't you been watching? David!

248
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,150
<i>Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i>

249
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,450
We have to ask you to try to stay calm, 
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

250
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,050
<i>We have a fix on three of the occurrences
about to appear over American cities.</i>

251
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,050
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

252
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,700
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles,</i>

253
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,900
<i>the other two are on our eastern seaboard
headed towards New York</i>

253
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,050
<i>and Washington, DC.</i>

254
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Marty, Marty. Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

255
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,050
We're heading down there now.

256
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,050
All right, Everybody,
head down to the basement!

257
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,650
Take it slow, don't run!
Walk down to the basement!

258
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:20,900
There's no shame in hiding.

259
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,150
Oh, I'd better call my mother.

260
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,250
Well, look who we have here.

261
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,600
Hey, Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

262
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,800
Dusted the wrong field.

263
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,250
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

264
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,150
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

265
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,500
Oh, yeah! It seems years back,
our boy was kidnapped by aliens.

265
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,000
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.
Tell them about it, Russ.

266
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,000
You get a couple of beers in him,
and he'll tell you all about it, crazy stuff.

267
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,000
Won't you, Russ?

268
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,200
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

269
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,700
you know, sexual things?

270
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,700
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

271
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,450
<i>Well, wake up!</i>

272
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,500
<i>What's happening? What's going on?</i>

273
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,100
- What's that?
- Let's get out of here, come on!

274
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,000
Wow!

275
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,750
Mommy, look it!

276
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,000
It's too early, baby.

277
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,500
Is it an earthquake?

278
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,500
Not even a four-pointer.

279
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,750
Go back to sleep.

280
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,000
Daddy!

281
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,900
What are you doing here?

282
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,400
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?

283
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,400
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

285
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,600
The signal!

286
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,050
My God!

287
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Now what do we do?

288
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,300
Address the nation.

289
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,200
There's gonna be a lot of
frightened people out there.

290
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,850
Yeah.

291
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,000
I'm one of them.

292
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,600
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

293
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,700
He's just trying to impress you.

294
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,700
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job

295
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,150
and stop slobbering all over my shoes.

296
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,500
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

297
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,800
Neighbors're moving out. I guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

298
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,200
A little shake and they running.

299
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.</i>

300
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,850
Hey, baby, there's something
on the news about the quake!

301
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:23,500
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.

302
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,650
- What's you been doing out there?
- Shooting aliens.

303
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,500
Oh, you shooting aliens, right?
Oh, you think you're tough, huh?

304
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,600
What you got? Turn around.

305
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,950
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

306
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,250
Watch out! Watch it now!

307
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,700
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.

308
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,300
Ow! Dylan!

309
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,600
<i>Come on, honey, let's go!</i>

310
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,600
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

311
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,950
Babe?

312
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,600
Boom, boom, boom!

313
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,300
<i>Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived</i>

314
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,100
<i>over the capitals of
India, England, and Germany</i>

315
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,650
<i>bringing estimates up to anywhere
from 10 to 15 of these city-size spacecraft.</i>

316
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,450
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

317
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,500
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

318
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,000
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!

319
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,400
Oh, Ma! Ma, listen!

320
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,000
Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

321
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,150
Don't argue with me! Just go!

322
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:55,750
David, why did I just send
my mother to Atlanta?

323
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,800
David! David, talk to me.

324
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,100
Didn't you hear me tell you that
the signal hidden in the satellite feed

325
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,200
is slowly recycling down to extinction?

326
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,150
- Not really.
- Countdown.

327
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,550
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?

328
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,850
It's like in chess. First you
strategically position your pieces.

329
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:18,100
Then, when the timing's right,
you... strike. See?

330
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,850
They're positioning themselves
all over the world

331
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:23,550
using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

332
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,950
In approximately, six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown's gonna be over.

333
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,650
And then what?

334
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,700
Checkmate.

335
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:38,050
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

336
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,050
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

337
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,950
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!

338
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,900
Uh, forget my lawyer.

339
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,300
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.</i>

340
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,400
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

341
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,550
<i>My fellow Americans,</i>

342
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,000
<i>a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.</i>

343
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,200
<i>The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe</i>

344
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,250
has been answered.

345
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,700
Although it's understandable that many of us
sense a feel of hesitation or even fear,

346
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,600
we must attempt to reserve judgment.

347
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,250
He says he's your husband.

348
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,400
Oh, God!

349
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,350
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.

350
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,850
This is hardly the time or the place
to be having that same old discussion!

351
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,450
You don't understand.
You gotta leave Washington.

352
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,100
Well, in case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little bit of a crisis here!

353
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,050
Honey, they're communicating with
a hidden signal. They're gonna attack.

354
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,100
- You are just being paranoid!
- <i>It's not paranoia!</i>

355
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,550
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably been overlooked--

356
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,750
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

357
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,400
- Please?
- Okay, okay.

358
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,700
<i>The staff and I will remain in the White House
as we attempt to establish communication.</i>

359
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,650
<i>If you feel compelled to leave these cities,</i>

360
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,150
<i>please do so in an orderly fashion.</i>

361
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,550
Excuse me! Coming through!
362
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:12,900
<i>The arrival of the alien visitors has caused...</i>

363
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,650
<i>over 10,000 fender benders
in just a few seconds' time.</i>

364
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,000
<i>But this is just the beginning.</i>

365
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,200
Uh-uh! Come on, man! You can't go!
You got to call them back!

365
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,400
I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

366
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,600
I've got to report to El Toro.

366
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,300
But you said you was on leave for the 4th!

367
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,600
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

368
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:33,050
Look, why are you acting like this?

369
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,450
Why?

370
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,800
That's why!

371
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,850
Look... I really don't think

372
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,250
they flew 90 billion light years
to come gown here and start a fight

373
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,300
and get all rowdy.

374
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,350
Look, why don't you just relax?

375
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,450
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's going on.

376
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:11,700
- What are you doing in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just driving.

377
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,850
Look...

378
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,550
Hey, I got these for you.

379
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,350
- Firecrackers!
- You be careful.

380
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,650
Steve, wait.

381
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,150
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

382
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,700
You take care of yourself, you hear?

383
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,700
Look...

384
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,900
Why don't you get some things packed

384
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
and you and Dylan come stay
with me on the base?

385
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,750
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

386
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,800
Really?

387
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,800
You don't mind?

388
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,950
Well, I mean...

389
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,600
I will have to let all my other girlfriends know

390
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,750
that they can't come over. You know,
I got to postpone the freaky deaky.

391
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,350
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

392
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,850
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

393
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,950
Yes, I am.

394
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:05,450
Them big old Dumbo ears.

395
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,550
Look at you with them chicken legs.

396
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,000
Come on, Dylan.

397
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Look out!

398
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,500
Hey! Whoa!

399
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,600
The television said they started the looting
already, heven't they? Vultures!

400
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,800
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?

401
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,700
- David, you don't have a license.
- You're driving.

402
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,700
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!

403
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,050
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

404
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,900
You're staying there to keep people calm.

405
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
It's the right thing to do.
I'm not gonna let them criticize you for it.

406
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,100
I appreciate your trying to help me.

407
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,950
Liar. Stick to the truth.
It's what you're good at.

408
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,500
All right, I'll tell you the truth.
I don't want you in any one of those cities.

409
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,100
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.

410
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,150
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're gonna take you to Nellis.

411
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,650
- <i>And the munchkin?</i>
- She's gonna meet you there.

412
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,850
All right. I love you.

413
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,750
I love you.

414
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,950
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye.

415
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,300
It's the White House for grying out loud!

416
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,700
- You can't just drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this thing go any faster?

417
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,900
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! Believe me, they know.

417
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,900
She works for the president.
They know everything.

418
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,300
They don't know this.

419
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,300
Oh, oh, oh! You're gonna educate them, huh?

419
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,300
So tell me something.
How are you so smart,

420
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,900
how come you spent eight years in MIT
to become a cable repairman?

421
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,900
Dad!

422
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,450
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things, David.

423
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,550
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

424
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,150
Look at these people. Look, huh?

425
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,350
Vultures. They take and then they go.

426
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,700
They're going faster than we are.
Look at this. We're in the fast lane!

427
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,000
I can't go faster.
They're cutting me off here.

427
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,700
No one's cutting you off!
We're not gonna get a ticket!

428
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
They're getting in front.
I can't go any faster.

429
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,400
All right, all right, all right.
I don't wanna argue. I don't wanna argue.

430
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,900
- Let's just get there as quickly as possible.
- What's the rush, huh?

431
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,500
You think we'll get to Washington,
and it won't be there?

432
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,700
<i>A local crop-duster was arrested today</i>

432
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,400
<i>as he papered the city hall
with leaflets from the air.</i>

433
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Everybody's leaving.

433
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,300
<i>Can you give us some of your time?
Do you want to make a statement?</i>

434
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
<i>We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!</i>

435
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,600
<i>They did all kinds of experiments on me!</i>

436
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,800
<i>They've been studying us for years,
finding out our weaknesses!</i>

437
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,150
<i>We've gotta stop them!
They're gonna kill us all!</i>

438
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,550
<i>Some people attribute his eccentric
behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome</i>

439
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,850
<i>from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.</i>

440
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
<i>Others, however, have a more unusual theory.</i>

441
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,350
<i>How would you describe Mr. Casse?</i>

442
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,300
<i>- Keeps to himself.
- Private.</i>

442
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,050
<i>- Quiet
- Real quiet.</i>

443
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,550
<i>When they took him up in the spaceship,</i>

444
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,250
<i>the aliens abused him</i>

445
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,450
<i>sexually.</i>

446
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,650
<i>Mr. Casse is in the county lock-up
this evening.</i>

447
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
- Pack up. We're leaving.
- <i>However, Sherriff's deputy has said that</i>

448
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,000
<i>given the extenuating circumastances,
he may be released later tonight.</i>

449
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,300
Miguel, what about Dad?

450
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:07,300
This could be our last night on Earth.

451
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
You don't wanna die a virgin, do you?

452
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,600
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

453
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,150
Miguel!

454
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,850
Stop it!

455
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,700
Thanks a lot, partner!

456
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,500
You read my mind!

457
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:31,600
Stay here.

458
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,000
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

459
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,650
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

460
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

461
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,600
Come on, boy!

462
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,850
We're leaving without you.

463
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,400
We're going to live with Uncle Hector
in Tucson.

465
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,450
Hector!

466
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,700
Like hell you are. I'm still your father.

467
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,750
No, you're not.

468
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,250
You're just the man who married my mother.

469
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
You're nothing to me!

470
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,400
Oh!

471
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,950
Oh!

472
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,800
Well, what about Troy?

473
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,900
- Troy?
- Yeah.

474
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,750
For once in your life, why don't you
think about what's best for him?

475
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,000
Who has to beg for money to buy him
medicine when you screw up, huh?

476
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,400
Who? Who?!

477
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,950
You stop it right now!

478
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm not a baby anymore!

479
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:31,500
I don't want your stupid medicine,
because I'm so sick of medicine!

480
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,300
Do you know what this stuff costs?!

481
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,450
Do you wanna get sick again?

482
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:39,100
Do you?

483
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>Once again, the L.A.P.D.
is asking Los Angelenos</i>

483
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,700
<i>not to fire their guns
at the visitor spacecraft.</i>

484
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,050
<i>You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.</i>

485
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,300
Do you think we can find something
better to do with our time, gentlemen?

486
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,200
Where've you been, Stevie?

487
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:56,700
Man, this is unbelievable.
This is, like, huge.

488
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,450
- They've recalled everybody.
- Well, looks like the mail's still working.

489
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, oh, oh!

490
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,150
You'll have to do the honors for me, man.

491
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,900
- You're a wuss!
- Yeah, whatever. Shut up and read it.

492
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,100
It says... "Captain Steven Hiller"...

493
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,450
Loser.

494
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,100
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!
- "United States..." Blah, blah, blah, blah.

495
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
"We regret to inform you that

496
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,950
"despite your excellent record of service..."

497
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,800
I'm sorry, man.

498
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,450
You know what you need to do?

499
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,300
You need to, like, kiss some serious
booty to get ahead in this world, man.

500
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,450
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

501
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,700
See, I like the one-knee approach,

502
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,800
because it puts the booty,
like, right in front of the lip...

503
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,500
- What's this?
- That's nothing.

504
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,700
Hold on! Hold, hold, man! What is this?

505
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,050
Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins.
I don't know.

506
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,050
Stevie, this is a wedding ring!

507
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,350
I thought you said you were gonna
break the whole thing off?

508
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,350
Yes...

509
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,400
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

510
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,650
You know that, right?

511
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,500
Man, you're never gonna get to fly
the space shuttle, if you marry a stripper.

512
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,400
<i>It could only happen in California.
Here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.</i>

513
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,400
<i>Belows us, we can see
hundreds of UFO fanatics</i>

513
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,800
<i>who have gathered on rooftops
here in downtown Los Angeles</i>

514
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,850
<i>to welcome the new arrivals.</i>

515
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!</i>

516
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,650
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

517
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,600
Oh, I must have been tripping.

518
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,800
<i>It's being called the party event of the century!</i>

519
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,500
<i>And everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.</i>

520
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,400
- This is so cool!
- Girl, please!

521
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,500
Oh, hey! I made it before I came in tonight.

522
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,800
Check it out!

523
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,400
Now, I know you're not thinking
about joining those idiots.

524
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

525
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,550
- Do you wanna come?
- Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

526
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,600
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

527
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,900
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got
when I went to Las Vegas?

528
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,300
Yeah. And I was right. You didn't get the job
and you lost all your money gambling.

529
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:23,550
Yeah, but I wasn't in L.A. for the earthquake.

530
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,950
Tiff, I really don't want you to go up there.

531
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,450
- Now promise me you won't.
- Oh!

532
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,700
Come on, girl. Promise me.

533
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,650
I promise.

534
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,950
Okay.

535
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,150
Look...

536
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm going. I'm out of town for a while.

537
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,900
- Later.
- Bye.

538
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,750
Hey, there's my angel. Come on.

539
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,000
Come on, Boomer. Let's go.

540
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,900
Hey, come on. Talk to your boyfriend later.

541
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,100
Hey! What the hell's the kid doing here, huh?

542
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,300
- Get out of here!
- You try finding a sitter today.

542
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,500
Hey! Hey, where do you
think you're you going?

543
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,250
- You leave, you're fired.
- Nice working with you, Mario.

544
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Come on, Boomer.

545
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,800
Everyone in the world is trying
to get out of Washington.

546
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.

547
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,750
What the hell is that?

548
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,550
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

549
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,500
You think an important person
like Constance is gonna be listed?

550
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:28,700
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

551
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,150
Sometimes it's her just first initial,
sometimes it's her nickname,

552
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,200
- sometimes just her...
- Oy, my God!

553
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,250
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

554
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,600
- Where are they going? Please stop!
- Tell them! Tell them!

555
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,900
Slow down!

556
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,850
Off-ramp!

557
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,600
Slow down!

558
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,450
- We made it! We made it!
- Good, good.

559
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,600
Nice driving, Pops.

560
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,550
Well...

561
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,650
So, not listed, huh?

562
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,000
No, no. I just haven't found it yet.

563
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,500
I tried C. Spano, Connie Spano,
Spunky Spano...

564
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,800
Spunky?

565
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:16,950
- College nickname.
- Ah! Cute.

566
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,900
- You tried Levinson?
- She didn't take my name when we were married.

567
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,150
Why would she...?
What are you talking about?

568
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,250
Try it.

569
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,750
Okay. Here. Look.

570
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,350
So, what do I know, hmm?

571
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,950
So?

572
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,450
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should I?

573
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,100
- Oh, perfect, she's using it.
- What, what, what? It's busy?

574
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:59,500
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

575
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,100
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,000
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

577
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,500
- Take care.
- <i>The visitors have arrived,</i>

578
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,700
<i>but the president remains
at the White House.</i>

579
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,400
<i>Question: Are Mr. Whitmore's actions...</i>

580
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,550
<i>A. ultra brave,</i>

581
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,200
<i>or B. foolhardy?</i>

582
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,950
- What?
- <i>Don't hang up, sweetie.</i>

583
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,350
David! How did you get this number?

584
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:25,800
- <i>Do me a favor. Walk to the window.</i>
- And I'm looking for what?

585
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,850
<i>You'll see.</i>

586
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,950
<i>Over here.</i>

587
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,250
<i>See us?</i>

588
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,300
How does he do that?

589
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,900
Now, in light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors,

590
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,400
Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter

591
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,900
with a type of visual communications device.

592
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:58,150
- Mr. President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

593
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,000
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing lift-off.

594
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,900
<i>...and refitted with these
enormous light panels</i>

595
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,600
that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

596
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,950
<i>Echo One, Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>

597
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,200
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

598
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:14,700
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.</i>

599
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:17,500
This is something I would never believe
in my lifetime that I would be.

600
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,750
In the White House! Look at this!

601
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,200
If I knew I was gonna meet the president,
I would have worn a tie.

602
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,700
I mean, look at me. I look like a schlemiel.

603
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,100
You look fine, Pops.

604
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,100
Oy, my God!

605
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,000
David, I don't know happy
he's gonna be to see you.

606
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,200
Yeah, that's right.

606
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,200
I'm telling you, we're wasting time,
he's not gonna listen to me. We should go.

607
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,900
Why wouldn't he? Why wouldn't he listen?

607
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,900
Because last time I saw him,
we got into a fight.

608
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

609
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,600
- You punched the president?!
- He wasn't the president then.

610
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,600
I punched him, he fought back,
we wrestled around. It was a fight!

611
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,400
A fight that you started!

612
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,450
Because David thought
that I was having an affair.

613
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,000
- With the president?
- Which, of course, I wasn't!

614
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:54,050
Hey, hey! You know, either go get him,
or we should head back to the car.

615
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,000
All right, I'll get him. You wait here,
and don't touch anything!

616
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,100
You punched the president?

617
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,400
God!

618
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,400
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

619
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:12,700
- We're closing in.

620
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,500
<i>Roger that. You are good to commence
sequence when ready.</i>

621
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,900
This I like.

622
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:22,900
Look at this!

623
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,550
You know what famous people
have been here, hmm?

624
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:26,650
Yes, Dad.

625
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:28,750
Politicians, sctors...

626
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,950
Baseball players, singers...

627
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,000
And now me.

628
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,650
Imagine that!
"Look, a poor immigrant like me."

629
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
- "It's a dream!"
- David, please!

630
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,400
<i>The three choppers are
steadily approaching</i>

631
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,900
<i>what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships,</i>

631
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,150
<i>a parabolic indentation nine cities...</i>

632
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:49,100
- You're leaving now?
- <i>...wide in diameter.</i>

633
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,500
Hey, see if they've got those pens
that they give away.

634
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,600
Dad, what?

635
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,600
You'd still think I have
a choice of my company.

636
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,300
- I don't have time for this, Connie.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

637
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,900
Mr. President, Julius Levinson.

638
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,300
- David is my son.
- I told you he wouldn't listen.

638
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,100
- Νο, you have to tell him now.
- Are you ready?

639
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,300
- Tell him. David, you have to tell him!
- Just one second. David...

639
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,100
- Connie!
- David, tell him!

640
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,700
I know why we have satellite disruption.

641
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,700
All right. Go ahead.

642
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,450
Okay.

643
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,350
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate

644
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:26,200
with spaceships on different sides
of the Earth.

645
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,700
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

646
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,300
You're talking about line of sight?

647
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,850
Yeah, that's right, exactly.
The curve of the Earth prevents it.

648
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,350
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

649
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:41,750
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...

650
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,850
our own satellite system.

651
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:50,150
Excuse me, Mr. President.
They're starting.

652
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,600
They're using our own satellites against us.

653
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:00,600
The clock is ticking.

654
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,350
- Bringing it in to hover.
- <i>Welcome Wagon,</i>

655
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,950
<i>Echo One. Approaching alien ship.</i>

656
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,800
Initiating communication sequence,
Echo One.

657
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,800
<i>Welcome Wagon has commenced.</i>

658
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,100
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.

659
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,700
Tell them to evacuate as many people
out of the cities as they can.

660
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,650
Yes, sir.

661
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back immediately.

662
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,150
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

663
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,600
Kim, my daughter.

664
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,600
There's something happening here.

665
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,300
- They're responding.
- <i>Something's opening.</i>

666
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,150
<i>Something is happening.</i>

667
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,000
It looks like there's some kind of activity here.

667
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,850
This may be some type of response,
Echo One.

668
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,100
<i>We see it, too. Can't identify it.</i>

669
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,900
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

670
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,900
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

671
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,250
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

672
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,200
Nice. Very nice.

673
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,700
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

674
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,450
We have our own phone.

675
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,000
Move out of here.

676
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,200
The president's ordered an evacuation.
We have to leave now.

677
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,200
<i>And our prayers go out to the wives
and children of those brave pilots.</i>

678
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,650
- <i>Indeed, God help us all.</i>
- Mrs. Whitmore...

679
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,400
<i>The visitors responded with terrifying...</i>

680
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,400
<i>Authorities have called for complete
evacuation of Los Angeles County.</i>

681
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,900
<i>People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.</i>

682
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,100
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me!

683
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,150
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

684
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,000
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

685
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,800
- Can we move it along?
- <i>Dr. Katz's office.</i>

686
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,100
- Hello. Dr. Katz, please.
- <i>I'm sorry, he's not available.</i>

687
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,600
Listen, for $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

688
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,800
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

689
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,800
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

690
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,000
Mrs. Whitmore!

691
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,350
<i>You must leave now.</i>

692
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,900
No!

693
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,600
The First Lady's secured.
We're on the move.

694
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,900
They're opening up!

695
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,700
It's so pretty.

696
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,300
Get the hell out of here!

697
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,200
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

697
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Right away, sir.

698
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,600
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

699
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,300
Here.

700
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:41,900
Time's up.

701
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,650
Oh, crap!

702
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,100
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

703
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,350
Come on, Boomer!

704
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:10,500
Boomer!

705
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,650
Boomer!

706
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,050
<i>Reports are unclear as to the extent
of the devastation, but from all accounts</i>

707
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,600
<i>Los Angeles, Washington,
and New York have been left in ruins.</i>

708
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,900
Good God!

709
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:53,550
I've been saying it.

710
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,350
I've been saying it for ten damn years!
Ain't I been saying it, Miguel?

711
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,550
Huh? I've been saying it!

712
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,900
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.

713
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,300
Pull it over, man.

714
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,700
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone, man. I got it.

715
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,150
Miguel!

716
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,000
Look at all that.

717
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,600
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

718
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,050
That's the advantage of
being a fighter pilot.

719
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,900
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

720
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:04,100
This is just...

721
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,350
not simple any more.

722
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,400
A lot of people died today.

723
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,550
How many didn't have to?

724
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:22,100
Any news on my wife yet?

725
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,550
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

726
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,950
No radio contact.

727
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:39,750
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

728
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,550
Here it is.

729
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,300
What happened, Mommy?

730
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,350
I don't know, baby.

731
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:25,250
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

732
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,450
Our target is to the north,

733
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,850
centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

734
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,950
Our Black Knight Squadron...

735
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,450
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

736
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
- You?
- Nope.

737
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,600
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.

738
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,800
Something you wanna add
to this briefing, Captain Hiller?

739
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:51,500
No, sir. Just a little anxious to get
up there and whup ET's ass, that's all.

740
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,350
You'll get your chance.

741
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You'll all get your chance.

742
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,800
Good hunting.

743
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,500
Dismissed!

744
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,000
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

745
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,700
Come on! Ready to go, sir!

746
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,400
Let's bring it home.
Let's bring that bad boy home, captain!

747
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,500
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

748
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:18,250
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

749
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,250
Hey, hey, don't get pre-patrol on me, soldier.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

750
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,100
I'm all ears, brother.

751
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,350
You the man!

752
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:43,150
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

753
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,500
General Grey here.

754
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,600
Al?

755
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,500
All satellite microwave and ground
communications with the cities are down.

756
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,600
All systems gone.

757
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,100
For intelligence, we believe
we're looking at a total loss.

758
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:56,900
How about our boys? Where are they?

759
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:59,700
ETA to target, four minutes.

760
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:09,500
I shouldn't have left her.

761
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:11,500
Don't worry about it, big man.

762
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:14,700
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

763
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,050
Or, as the good Reverend would say...

764
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,400
"Why we're on this particular mission,
we'll never know."

765
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,450
<i>"But I do know, here today</i>

766
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,900
"that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."

767
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,150
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.

768
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,900
Holy God!

769
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,300
Lock and load!

770
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,050
Roger that. Los Angeles attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

771
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:02,850
Washington and New York squadrons
reporting lock-on.

772
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,050
Fire at will.

773
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:06,250
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

774
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,300
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

775
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:13,650
Knight Three, fox three!

776
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,700
Knight Seven, fox three.

777
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,700
Missiles have been fired.

778
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,750
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.

779
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:46,050
Command, Knight One. Command, Knight One.
Switching to Sidewinders, moving in.

780
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:52,800
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

781
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,150
Knight Seven, 120.

782
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,800
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

783
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:00,550
Knight Seven, Fox three.

784
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,950
Come on, come on!

785
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,450
They must have some kind of protective
shield over the hull! Knights, pull up! Pull up!

786
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,150
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

787
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,000
Pull up!

789
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,650
Blow through, blow through!

790
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,000
Too many of them!

791
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,650
They got another one, sir.

792
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,000
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

793
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:54,000
I got you covered, Big Daddy.

794
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,050
Damn, they got shields, too!

795
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,700
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

796
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,850
Jesus!

797
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,850
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

798
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,350
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing it.

799
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,500
All right, get them out of there.

800
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,400
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission! Abort mission right away!

801
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,350
All right, I think we're gonna have to make a run
for this one here! Let's get low, let's get fast!

802
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
I've got you, Big Daddy. Let's get them!

804
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Watch the deck.

805
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:55,400
- Squadron leader, do you read? Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

806
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:56,650
Get them out of there!

807
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,600
What's with he monitor?
Where's the picture?

807
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,000
We've lost the satellite.

808
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:14,000
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

809
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,950
Come on, come on, come on, come on! 
Move, move, move!

810
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:21,400
It's gonna be like white on rice, Big Daddy!

811
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,850
All right, Jimmy. They ain't got nothing for us!
Let's push it! We gotta go! We gotta go!

812
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,250
- I can't shake them. I can't shake them.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you. Let's go!

813
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,900
- I'm gonna try something.
- Don't do nothing stupid over there!

814
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:33,000
- You know me!
- That's what I talking about!

815
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,950
Jimmy, Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed!

816
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:40,000
<i>Jimmy, he's closing on you!</i>

817
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,000
- Put your mask back on! That's an order, Marine!
- I can't breathe!

818
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,800
Jimmy!

819
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:50,150
Jimmy!

820
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,000
Jimmy, no!

821
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,150
That's affirmative. We have incoming.

822
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,700
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

823
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,200
Friendly?

824
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:02,300
Sergeant?

825
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,550
I don't think so.

826
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,300
Come on and get me! Come and get me!

827
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,100
What are you shooting at?!

828
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:42,950
Where you at, baby?!
Come on! Come on!

829
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,600
You can't hit nothing!

830
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,750
Whoa! Low bridge!

831
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,250
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

832
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,500
Hope you got an airbag!

835
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,150
Son of a bitch!

837
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,950
That's right! That's right!

838
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,900
Get off! Get off of me!

839
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:10,950
That's what you'll get!

840
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:12,500
Look at you!

841
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:15,750
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

842
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,750
Huh?! Who's the man?!
Wait till I get another plane!

843
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,500
I'm lining all your friends up, right beside you!

844
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,800
Where you at, huh? Where you at?!

845
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,750
Welcome to Earth.

846
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,850
That's what I call a close encounter.

847
01:06:57,450 --> 01:07:00,000
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

848
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,100
Keys. Come on, keys.

849
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:13,600
Yes!

850
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,600
Come, baby, come on.
Come on, come on!

851
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:18,450
Yes!

852
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,600
<i>Rumor reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world</i>

853
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,350
<i>with the exact same results.</i>

854
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,150
You're just like your mother, you know that?
She was stubborn too.

855
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,500
I had to twist her arm
to get her to take her medicine.

856
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,150
- You're gonna be all right.
- You're gonna be fine.

857
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,750
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.

858
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:47,650
I couldn't find anything.
Everyone's packing up. They're leaving.

859
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,900
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

859
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,300
We'd better leave too, then.

860
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,050
Penicillin. At least, it'll help you
keep his fever down.

861
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:59,350
Thank you. It's really nice of you to help us.

862
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:02,000
I wish I could do more, but we're moving out.

863
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,450
I'm going with you.

864
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:11,450
Well, I just mean that we're going too.

865
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:12,800
Cool.

866
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:14,850
Tell that punk to shut the door.
We're out of here.

867
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:17,200
He can sniff around somewhere else.

868
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:18,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

869
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:30,200
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

870
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:34,500
- I don't feel so good.
- Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

871
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,450
Could be bad weather, could be
good weather. Doesn't matter.

872
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,350
We could go up, we could go down.

873
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,600
We could go back, we could go forwards,
we could go side to side...

874
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,000
What did I say?

875
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:51,550
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

876
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,900
Julius, with all of this, I...

877
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,200
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

878
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,850
All he could think of was getting to you.

879
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,050
There's still love there, I think.

880
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,450
Love was never a problem.

881
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,050
All you need is love.

882
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,600
John Lennon. Smart man.

883
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,850
Shot in the back, very sad.

884
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:23,300
We've moved as many of our forces
away from our bases as possible.

885
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,600
But we've already sustained heavy losses.

885
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,000
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

886
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,600
They agree we must launch a counter
offensive with a full nuclear strike.

887
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,150
Over American soil?!

888
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:37,700
You're saying at this point we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians? Is that right?

889
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,100
Sir, if we don't strike soon, there may not
be much of an America left to defend!

890
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,200
Sir! They've taken out NORAD!

891
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,600
- What?!
- It's gone, sir.

892
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,450
My God!

893
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,850
The vice president? The joint chiefs?

894
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,050
Mr. President...

895
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,100
We must launch.

896
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,000
A delay now would be more costly than
when you waited to evacuate the cities.

897
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,700
No, no. You're not gonna
launch nuclear weapons!

898
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,350
You're gonna kill them and us
at the same time. If we fire nukes...

899
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,900
- ...then everybody else who's got them,
is gonna fire them. - Sir, may I remind you

900
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
- ...that you are a guest here?
- You know what that means? Fallout!

901
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,100
You ever hear of nuclear winter?

901
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,100
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- David, you can't interfere with the conversation.

901
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:10,200
- Do you hear what they're talking about?
- I know, I know.

901
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:11,200
- Don't even think about it!
- Just go.

902
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:12,200
- I don't have to go.
- You have to leave.

902
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,300
It can't be allowed!

903
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,400
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Hey, hey, don't tell him to shut up!

904
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,950
You'd all be dead now,
if it wasn't for my David!

905
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,250
None of you did anything to prevent this!

906
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,050
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

907
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.

908
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:32,700
It was, what? In the 19... What? ...50s,
whatever, you had that spaceship.

909
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:37,000
- Dad, look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing that you found in New Mexico!

910
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,100
- Dad!
- Where was that?

910
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,250
No, not the spaceship.

911
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,900
- Roswell! Roswell, New Mexico. Yeah!
- Don't do this.

911
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,250
No, you had the spaceship
and you had the bodies!

912
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,400
- They were locked up in a bunker.
- Come on.

913
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,800
- Where was that?
- David?

914
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,400
- Area 51! Right?
- I don't know.

915
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,900
Area 51! You knew then!
And you did nothing.

916
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,000
Sir....

917
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,250
Regardless of what you may
have read in the tabloids,

918
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,250
there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

919
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,900
Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.

920
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:07,100
And there's no recovered spaceship.

921
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:10,350
Excuse me, Mr. President.

922
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:14,400
That's not entirely accurate.

923
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,350
What? Which part?

924
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,000
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

925
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,250
Sorry.

926
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:52,000
The end hath come!

927
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:55,700
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

928
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:58,800
Hop on! We're heading out to El Toro!

929
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,850
You cannot defy what hath come!

930
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,000
It is the end!

931
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,450
El Toro?!

932
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,950
- Can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.

933
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:30,900
Oh, God!

934
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:40,150
Okay, okay, let's get this off.

935
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,350
Here, let me help you.

936
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,400
She's hurt pretty badly.

937
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,550
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

938
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:57,750
But, no!

939
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,400
You got me out here, dragging your
heavy ass through the burning desert

940
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,700
with your dreadlocks sticking
out the back of my parachute.

941
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,750
You gotta come down here with an attitude,

942
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,000
acting all big and bad.

943
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,500
And what the hell is that smell?!

945
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,550
I could've been at a barbecue!

946
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,550
But I ain't mad.

947
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,200
It's all right. It's all right.

948
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:44,450
Hey!

949
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,400
Hey! Hey!

950
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,000
Hey!

951
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,100
Do you need a lift, soldier?

952
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,300
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

953
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,700
It ain't on the map.

954
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,850
Trust me, it's there.

955
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:36,700
Ten hut!

956
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,650
Mr. President, General.

957
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,800
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

958
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:49,850
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface,

959
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,850
and... here's our main research facility.

960
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,150
Let's see it.

961
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:57,350
I'm sorry, sir, it's a clean room.
It's to keep it static free.

962
01:14:57,500 --> 01:14:59,800
- If we'd all get to decontamination...
- Open the door.

963
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:02,650
Yes, sir.

964
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,650
My God!

965
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,900
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

966
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:32,250
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

967
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,600
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

968
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,400
How do you get funding
for something like this?

969
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:47,500
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

970
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,850
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

971
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,000
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

972
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,350
He's been heading up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

973
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,500
How do you do?

974
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,500
Mr. President!

975
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,550
Wow!

976
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:07,800
This...

977
01:16:07,950 --> 01:16:10,000
What a pleasure!

978
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,250
As you can imagine, they...

979
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,300
They don't let us out much.

980
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,150
I can understand that.

981
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:20,600
Well...

982
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:24,550
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

983
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,050
Follow me.

984
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:19,200
She's a beaut, ain't she?

985
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,000
As you can see from the repairs,

986
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:26,500
we've been trying to put her back
together since the late 1960s.

987
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,850
Don't tell me you've had this for 40 years
and you don't know anything about them.

988
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,800
Oh, hell, no! No, no, no, no, no!

989
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,600
We know tons about them.

990
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,350
But the neatest stuff...

991
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,550
The neatest stuff has only happened
in the last few days.

992
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:44,300
See, we can't duplicate their type of power,
so we've never been able to experiment.

993
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:49,450
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

994
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,150
The last 24 hours have been really exciting!

995
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,800
Exciting?! People are dying out there.

996
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,400
I don't think "exciting" is the word
I'd choose to describe it!

997
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:03,000
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

998
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:05,000
You said you can repair their technology.

999
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,700
Can you tell us anything useful about them?

1000
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,500
Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean...

1001
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:12,000
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

1002
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:16,200
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1003
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:19,150
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

1004
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:21,750
Hey!

1005
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:23,450
Hey!

1006
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,600
You guys wanna see them?

1007
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
Hmm?

1008
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,050
This is...

1009
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,250
This is the vault.

1010
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,900
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

1011
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
the freak show.

1012
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,250
When we found them,

1013
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,750
they were wearing some sort
of biomechanical suits.

1014
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:17,400
Once we got them off, we learned
a great deal about their anatomy.

1015
01:19:18,150 --> 01:19:19,750
Eyes, ears,

1016
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,500
no vocal cords.

1017
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,150
We are assuming they communicate
with each other through some other means.

1018
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,500
You're obviously not thinking about
hand signals and body language.

1019
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:33,500
It's some kind of extrasensory
perception, telepathy.

1020
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,500
So...

1021
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,600
It's an organic life form.

1022
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,500
Can they be killed?

1023
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,500
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

1024
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,250
And these two died in the crash.

1025
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:51,250
This one a few weeks later.

1026
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:55,400
You just... You have to get through
their technology, which is...

1027
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:58,500
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

1028
01:20:00,050 --> 01:20:03,250
David, you unlocked part of their technology.

1029
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:04,800
You cracked the code.

1030
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:08,000
Oh, no, no. All I did was stumble onto their...

1031
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,300
...signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.

1032
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,650
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

1033
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,250
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

1034
01:20:19,250 --> 01:20:23,850
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1035
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,100
What code?

1036
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:58,000
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1037
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,100
I'm sorry, captain. This is a restricted area.
I can't let you pass without clearance.

1038
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:04,100
Okay. Come here.

1039
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,000
You wanna see my clearance?

1040
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,800
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.

1041
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:16,000
- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

1042
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:19,100
Did you see that?

1043
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,700
Come on down.

1044
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,200
Watch your step.

1045
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,800
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.

1046
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:31,400
Though how they sat on them, I don't know.

1047
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:32,750
Gently.

1048
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:35,550
- You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.

1049
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,250
We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this crap.

1050
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,300
Some stuff we figured out right away.

1051
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,650
This we're pretty sure is the life
support system for the cabin.

1052
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,800
And this doohickey is connected to...

1053
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:54,700
Oh! Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?

1054
01:21:56,350 --> 01:21:59,250
These configurations...

1055
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:05,400
Well, to be honest, we don't know
what the hell this crap is.

1056
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:11,450
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.

1057
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,600
Neat, huh?

1058
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:18,200
Could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?

1059
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:20,000
- What?
- See these patterns here?

1060
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,150
They are repeating sequentially,
just like their countdown signal.

1061
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,600
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1062
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,050
See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.

1063
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,850
You know...

1064
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,500
You're really starting to make us look bad.

1065
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:44,800
They got one! They got one alive!

1066
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:46,850
- They got one, alive!
- Jesus!

1067
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,400
You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?

1068
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:50,900
- Fine by it.
- Yeah.

1069
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,100
Don't touch anything.

1070
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,400
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.

1071
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,200
Here, here.

1071
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,500
Oh! It's all wet.

1072
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,400
Right here. We got him
in the back of the pickup.

1073
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,500
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1074
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,650
Guess who's coming to dinner!

1075
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,000
I need a doctor. I need a doctor!

1076
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:35,700
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?

1077
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:37,500
- About three hours.
- Let's get him in containment, stat!

1078
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,000
My son, he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!

1079
01:23:41,150 --> 01:23:44,000
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.

1080
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:47,250
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex.
Please!

1081
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,050
If you don't do something about it
right now, my son will die!

1082
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:57,450
- Okay, just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.

1083
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,450
You, take us to him, okay? Let's go.

1084
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,200
All right! Move it, move it, move it!

1085
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:09,350
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

1086
01:24:09,500 --> 01:24:11,700
When were you planning
on informing the rest of us?

1087
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:13,900
It had been deemed classified.

1088
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,700
You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!

1089
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,650
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack

1090
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,300
that cost the lives of hundreds
of American pilots!

1091
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,700
There was no way that we could have known

1091
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,500
that our fighters would have been
that ineffective against their attackers.

1092
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,800
Mr. President.

1093
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,700
The little bit of information we have comes
directly into this room, Mr. President.

1094
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:35,100
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

1095
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,700
Destroyed.

1096
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,350
We learned that NATO and Western Allied
installations were the first to be taken out.

1097
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:42,850
Then we were hit.

1098
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:46,150
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

1099
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,600
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15%.

1100
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:53,600
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,

1101
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:57,950
we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city...

1102
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,500
in the next 36 hours.

1103
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,500
We're being exterminated.

1104
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,700
Mr. President...

1105
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,150
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

1106
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,700
- Captain.
- Mr. President.

1107
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:15,900
Well done!

1108
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,500
Where is it now?

1109
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,700
We have it isolated down
in the containment lab, sir.

1110
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,750
I'd like to go see it.

1111
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,550
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1112
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,300
Hasn't anyone told you?

1113
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,850
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

1114
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:36,950
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!

1115
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:39,600
Today was the first time I used the subway.

1116
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:41,700
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

1117
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,250
These should last us a while.

1118
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:46,650
Don't move. I'll get it for you. Stay still.

1119
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:50,550
He's your son?

1120
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,350
He's my angel.

1121
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:55,850
Was his father stationed here?

1122
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
No, he...

1123
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,200
He wasn't his father.

1124
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,100
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

1125
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:11,650
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

1126
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,550
Oh! Ballet!

1127
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,450
No. Exotic.

1128
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:21,950
Oh! Sorry.

1129
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,500
Don't be. I'm not.

1130
01:27:24,650 --> 01:27:27,100
It's good money. Besides...

1131
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,100
My baby's worth it.

1132
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,350
Dylan, come here.

1133
01:27:31,550 --> 01:27:33,650
I want you to meet the First Lady.

1134
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:40,250
- Hello.
- Hi.

1135
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,750
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

1136
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:44,950
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

1137
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:47,200
I voted for the other guy.

1138
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:54,000
- All right, life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

1139
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,750
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

1140
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:57,550
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

1141
01:27:57,750 --> 01:28:00,300
Put the spreader right here,
right along the ridge.

1142
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:04,400
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

1143
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:07,700
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

1144
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:09,800
Let me get in.

1145
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:18,000
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

1146
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,200
Run this right in...

1147
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,650
All right. Okay.

1148
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,400
Let's proceed.

1149
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:34,300
Now comes the... the really icky part.

1151
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:38,100
Oh, boy!

1152
01:28:38,250 --> 01:28:41,800
This is one smelly, disgusting...

1153
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,350
Oh, look at it!

1154
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:54,000
It doesn't look alive, does it?

1155
01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:00,000
The arm is moving.

1156
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,850
Doctor? Doctor?

1157
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,350
Doctor?

1158
01:29:18,350 --> 01:29:20,000
Don't move! Don't move!

1159
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,700
Dr. Okun?

1160
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:32,950
<i>Release me.</i>

1161
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,300
- Open the door. Get him out of there!
- No, wait.

1162
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,450
<i>Release me</i>

1163
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,500
<i>now.</i>

1163
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:59,050
<i>Now!</i>

1164
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:07,750
<i>I know there is much
we can learn from each other,</i>

1165
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,400
<i>if we can negotiate a truce.</i>

1166
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,600
<i>We can find a way to coexist.</i>

1167
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:18,000
<i>Can there be a peace between us?</i>

1168
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:21,000
<i>Peace?</i>

1169
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:24,500
<i>No peace.</i>

1170
01:31:30,300 --> 01:31:32,350
<i>What is it you want us to do?</i>

1171
01:31:34,850 --> 01:31:36,750
<i>Die.</i>

1172
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,200
<i>Die!</i>

1173
01:31:52,850 --> 01:31:54,500
Mr. President.

1174
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,900
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.

1175
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:19,850
- Are you all right?
- I saw...

1176
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:21,600
...his thoughts.

1177
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:24,600
I saw what they're planning to do.

1178
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:29,300
They're like locusts.

1179
01:32:29,450 --> 01:32:31,450
They're moving from planet to planet.

1180
01:32:31,650 --> 01:32:33,700
Their whole civilization.

1181
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:37,550
After they've consumed every
natural resource, they move on.

1182
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,200
And we're next.

1183
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,600
Nuke them.

1184
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,900
Let's nuke the bastards.

1185
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:11,250
Just my luck. No ice.

1186
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,600
I take it you've heard?

1187
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:16,950
Hey, toast.

1188
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,100
To the end of the world.

1189
01:33:19,250 --> 01:33:21,650
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

1190
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:23,900
He didn't have any other choice.

1191
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:26,950
Well, you still believe in him.

1192
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:29,150
- Yeah.
- Well, he's a good man.

1194
01:33:30,950 --> 01:33:33,450
He'd better be. You left me for him.

1195
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,550
Or, you know, for your career.

1196
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:39,200
You know, it wasn't just my career.

1197
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:41,800
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

1198
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:46,100
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

1199
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:49,450
Yeah. And... I wasn't...

1200
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:51,600
- ...ambitious enough for you?
- David!

1201
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:53,800
David, you could have done
anything that you wanted.

1202
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,600
- Research, development...
- Oh, honey, I was happy where I was.

1203
01:33:57,750 --> 01:34:00,500
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

1204
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,500
I was part of something special.

1205
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:23,800
Well, if it makes any difference,

1206
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,000
I never stopped loving you.

1207
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:29,400
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1208
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:50,000
Let's pick it up, man. We've got
a tight schedule. Now, let's go!

1209
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,850
Let's pick it up, man.
We're on a tight schedule. Let's go!

1210
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:01,550
Pick it up, man!

1211
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,900
Pick it up!

1212
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:09,150
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!

1213
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:12,550
Look, I got something I gotta handle.
I'm just borrowing it.

1214
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:13,900
No, you're not, sir.

1215
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:16,550
Do you really wanna shoot me?

1216
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,400
Just tell them I hit you.

1217
01:35:26,700 --> 01:35:28,500
Command, this is Retal Op.

1218
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:32,000
Squadron is in the air. We are on
station and awaiting instructions.

1219
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,300
Roger. Break formation. Head to targets.

1220
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,800
Sir...

1221
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:42,750
They're breaking formation.

1222
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:47,100
- Mr. President, we're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1223
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:49,000
Which city will be reached first?

1224
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:52,550
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1225
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:55,550
- Houston!
- The major cities have been deserted.

1226
01:35:55,700 --> 01:36:00,350
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1227
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:05,250
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1228
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,800
We are in position.

1229
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,450
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1230
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,300
We are going to visual recon.

1231
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,100
<i>Roger that, NW.</i>

1232
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,850
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1233
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:24,350
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1234
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Laser targeting.

1235
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:30,900
Locked on.

1236
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:34,400
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

1237
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:41,700
Mr. President, if you wish to deploy,
the time is now.

1238
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,300
- Mr. President?
- Deploy.

1239
01:36:50,450 --> 01:36:53,200
- That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.
- That's correct. Deploy.

1240
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:54,800
Here we go.

1241
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:04,500
Bird's away.

1242
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:06,500
We have visual confirmation of the missile.

1242
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,200
It's on target.

1243
01:37:08,650 --> 01:37:10,250
<i>Approaching.</i>

1244
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:12,800
May our children forgive us.

1245
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:16,150
<i>Five seconds to impact. Three, two...</i>

1246
01:37:16,350 --> 01:37:17,450
...one.

1247
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,450
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!

1248
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,350
Get down! Get down!

1249
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:31,200
Can we confirm that
the target was destroyed?

1250
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:34,200
Get the tank commander on line. I want
confirmation that the target was destroyed.

1251
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,300
Yes, sir!

1252
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:38,700
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

1253
01:37:38,850 --> 01:37:41,850
- Repeat, Commander. You're breaking up.
- <i>We have lost visual.</i>

1254
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,500
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1255
01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:53,100
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1256
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,250
Good job, everyone! Congratulations!

1257
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,700
Commander, do you have visual?
I repeat, we need visual confirmation.

1258
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:03,500
Has the target been destroyed?

1259
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:19,100
Negative.

1260
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
<i>Target remains.</i>

1261
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,850
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>

1262
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:35,200
Call the other planes back.

1263
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:39,200
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1264
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,400
I said call them back!

1265
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,700
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1266
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:50,700
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1266
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,000
Abort mission right away.

1267
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,000
Jasmine!

1268
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,650
You're late!

1269
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:48,550
You know I like to make an entrance.

1270
01:39:57,650 --> 01:40:00,050
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

1271
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:03,550
Mr. President, your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1272
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:08,000
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier--
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

1274
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:14,500
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally, Mr. President.

1275
01:40:14,650 --> 01:40:18,250
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier--
- Wait a minute. What are you saying?

1276
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,800
We can't stop the bleeding.

1277
01:40:21,450 --> 01:40:23,550
If we'd...

1278
01:40:23,700 --> 01:40:25,800
There's nothing we can do for her.

1279
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,300
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1280
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,650
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1281
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:39,850
- I did?
- Mm-hm.

1282
01:40:42,050 --> 01:40:44,200
You just keep growing and growing.

1283
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,100
I can't...

1284
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,200
Hey.

1285
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:55,800
Can you wait outside for a little bit,
so mom can get a rest?

1286
01:40:55,950 --> 01:40:57,450
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1287
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,750
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1289
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:14,950
It's okay.

1290
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:18,800
The doctors...

1291
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:22,250
think that you're...

1292
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,450
gonna be just fine.

1293
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:28,950
Liar.

1294
01:42:25,050 --> 01:42:27,200
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1295
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,650
Yeah.

1296
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:34,150
Mommy's sleeping.

1297
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,200
Hey.

1298
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,050
David!

1299
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:14,650
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!

1300
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:16,350
Yeah. This I can see.

1301
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:19,150
We gotta burn the rainforest
with toxic waste,

1302
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:21,550
pollute the air and rip up the ozone layer!

1303
01:43:21,700 --> 01:43:24,250
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...

1304
01:43:25,300 --> 01:43:27,300
they won't want it anymore.

1305
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:29,050
Wait, wait, wait. David, David!

1306
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:31,300
Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.

1306
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,700
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm listening.

1307
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,650
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1308
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:38,100
David! Even myself.

1309
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,150
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1310
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:49,850
You see, sometimes...

1311
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,150
we have to remember what we still have.

1312
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:55,100
Like what?

1313
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:01,900
Well... you still have your health.

1314
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,400
David, David, you need your rest. Come on!

1315
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:08,850
Get off this freezing concrete floor
before you catch a cold. Come on.

1316
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:14,150
- What did you just say?
- You mean about faith?

1317
01:44:14,350 --> 01:44:16,950
- Well, you see, a man can live his life--
- No, no, no.

1318
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,450
No, the other part.

1319
01:44:18,550 --> 01:44:21,750
What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1321
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:29,350
What is that? What's the matter with you?

1322
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:32,450
- Genius.
- Genius?

1323
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,400
My dad. A total genius.

1324
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:39,100
Jerry, wake up.

1325
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:42,250
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1326
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:47,900
Look at that!

1327
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,300
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1328
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,500
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1329
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:58,550
- Hey, they're here.
- All right, Connie, what's this all about?

1330
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,900
I have no idea.

1331
01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:01,250
Get everybody off.

1332
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,700
Right, everybody. Clear the platform.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

1333
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:06,200
Major Mitchell...

1334
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,200
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1335
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:11,350
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1336
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:15,900
See that Coke can on top of the alien craft?

1337
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1338
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,850
Do it. Shoot it.

1339
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:23,200
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1340
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
What the hell are you doing?!

1341
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:33,300
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1342
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:36,650
See, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

1343
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:39,350
- We can't penetrate their defenses.
- We know that already. What's your point?

1344
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,000
Right. My point is, if we can't beat their defenses,
then we gotta get around them.

1345
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:47,750
Major, one more time... Any time.

1346
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1347
01:46:03,150 --> 01:46:06,600
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1348
01:46:07,250 --> 01:46:09,550
Are you telling us you can send out a signal

1349
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,700
that will disable all their shields?

1350
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:14,900
That's right. Just like they used
our satellites against us,

1351
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,350
we can use their own signal against them.

1352
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,800
If we plant a virus into that mother ship,

1353
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:23,950
it's gonna then filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1354
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:25,950
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1355
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:30,500
Just how exactly do we infect
the mother ship with this virus?

1356
01:46:31,300 --> 01:46:33,700
We're... We're gonna...

1357
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:38,850
have to... fly their alien craft out of
our atmosphere and dock with it.

1358
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,500
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1359
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,700
We then upload the virus.

1359
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:47,700
We then set off some kind of explosion,
which will disable it.

1360
01:46:47,800 --> 01:46:49,800
And that'll disorient the smaller ships below.

1360
01:46:49,900 --> 01:46:53,750
And that could buy you,
I think at least, some time to...

1361
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:57,350
to take them... take them out...
take them down.

1362
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:00,100
Do your... Do your stuff.

1363
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:04,200
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1364
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,200
I don't know. A matter of minutes.

1365
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:11,400
You want us to coordinate
a massive worldwide counterstrike

1366
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:13,600
with a window of only a few minutes?!

1367
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:17,250
- With shields down, that might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1368
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:21,100
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1369
01:47:21,250 --> 01:47:23,700
Not to mention that this whole
cockamamie plan

1370
01:47:23,800 --> 01:47:27,600
is dependent on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1371
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:30,300
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1372
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:34,300
I've seen these things in action. And I'm well
aware of their maneuvering capabilities.

1373
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:38,600
With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1374
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:41,750
That thing is a wreck!

1375
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:44,000
It crash-landed back in the '50s!

1376
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:46,400
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1377
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:48,950
Jim, remove the clamps.

1378
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:12,950
Any questions?

1379
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:19,700
Let's do it.

1380
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:24,900
All right, you heard the president,
let's get this thing preped and ready to fly!

1381
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,350
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,600
A virus!

1383
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:32,900
Your idea.

1384
01:48:33,100 --> 01:48:35,150
That's right.

1385
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:43,500
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1386
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,500
Do you really think you can do
all that bullshit you just said?

1388
01:48:56,100 --> 01:48:58,700
I understand you are upset
over the death of your wife.

1389
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:01,600
But that's no excuse for making
another fatal mistake.

1390
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,800
No! The only mistake I ever made

1390
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:06,700
was to appoint a sniveling little weasel
like you as Secretary of Defense.

1391
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:09,300
- I don't think you understand!
- However!

1392
01:49:09,450 --> 01:49:13,050
That is one mistake I am thankful
to say that I don't have to live with.

1393
01:49:13,200 --> 01:49:15,200
- Mr. President, please!
- Mr. Nimziki...

1394
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:17,000
You're fired.

1395
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,500
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

1396
01:49:24,650 --> 01:49:25,900
Yes, sir.

1397
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:27,600
He can't do that.

1398
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:30,550
Well, he just... did.

1399
01:49:34,400 --> 01:49:37,300
Command has attempted to compile
a list of casualties and losses,

1399
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:38,800
but information is sketchy at best.

1400
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,700
Well, we know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sina.

1401
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:45,900
There's a strong possibility ther may be more
reinforcements hiding in the Golan Straits.

1402
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:50,300
What the hell's he saying?

1402
01:49:50,400 --> 01:49:53,100
It seems they're getting a signal.
Old Morse code.

1403
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,100
It's from the Americans!

1404
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:11,750
They want to organize a counter offensive!

1405
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:14,900
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1406
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:40,400
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

1407
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:42,500
in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

1408
01:50:42,600 --> 01:50:45,700
That's impressive. Considering
it's all being done with...

1409
01:50:45,850 --> 01:50:47,150
Morse code.

1410
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:48,700
The armed forces here?

1410
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:51,250
We have sufficient aircraft
for the battleplan, but...

1411
01:50:51,450 --> 01:50:54,650
- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.

1412
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,750
Well, then, find them.

1413
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,000
<i>Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan</i>

1414
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:01,400
<i>trade rumors of military forces in hiding</i>

1415
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:05,800
<i>unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation.</i>

1416
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:09,200
What we're planning at this time
is to launch a counter offensive.

1417
01:51:09,350 --> 01:51:11,100
However, with our depleted manpower,

1418
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:14,400
we're asking that anyone with any
flight experience come forward.

1419
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:19,300
Military training is preferable, but anyone
who can fly a plane would be useful.

1420
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:22,950
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1421
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:28,100
- All right, guys, listen up!
- All right, pay close attention.

1422
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:31,300
These F-18s are very different
than the jets you piloted before.

1423
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:33,650
- It's kind of strong.
- You have to forgive the expression,

1424
01:51:33,800 --> 01:51:36,650
but you're about to get a crash course
in modern avionics.

1425
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:39,700
- Keep it coming. Keep it, keep it.
- Okay, you got it!

1426
01:51:39,800 --> 01:51:41,700
All right, listen up. Before we can begin,
we're gonna have to get

1427
01:51:41,800 --> 01:51:45,100
a little background information
on your flight experience.

1428
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,300
Let's start with you.

1429
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:48,650
Who, me?

1430
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,950
Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.

1431
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:58,300
And, after 'Nam, I got into crop-dusting.

1432
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,800
And... been doing that ever since.

1433
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:06,600
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that...

1434
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:11,000
ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,

1435
01:52:11,150 --> 01:52:13,050
I have been dying for some payback.

1436
01:52:13,250 --> 01:52:17,500
And I just want you to know that...
I won't let you down.

1437
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,150
You have one tactical nuclear missile

1438
01:52:21,250 --> 01:52:24,500
we're loading into this launcher
we're installing under the right wing.

1439
01:52:24,650 --> 01:52:26,600
This is the firing mechanism.

1440
01:52:26,750 --> 01:52:29,300
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1441
01:52:29,450 --> 01:52:31,600
Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth.

1442
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:34,350
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1443
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,500
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1444
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:40,950
Good luck, gentlemen.

1445
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,400
30 seconds.

1446
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:44,500
Tell me, tell me.

1446
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:46,000
Well, it's the strongest radio transmitter
we could get.

1447
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,700
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1448
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:50,750
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it a little too close?

1449
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:54,650
Oh! We're gonna be well on our way
back home before we shoot that thing off.

1450
01:52:56,300 --> 01:52:58,400
Why you? David!

1451
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,350
I don't... Excuse me. I don't understand...

1452
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:04,700
why you can't show someone else
how to plant the virus.

1453
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:07,100
- Someone who is trained.
- No. No, something may go wrong.

1454
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,100
I may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.

1455
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:14,200
Who knows? Hey, you know how like
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1456
01:53:18,700 --> 01:53:20,800
Here's my chance.

1457
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:25,200
Now he gets ambitious.

1458
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:28,650
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1459
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,550
Okay. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1460
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,800
So... How do I look?

1461
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,600
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1462
01:53:39,750 --> 01:53:42,800
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1463
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:45,800
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1464
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:50,150
Listen... Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1465
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,400
Sorry for what, babe?

1466
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:56,250
I should have done this a long time ago.

1467
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:59,750
- Do you have the ring?
- Yes, sir.

1468
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:02,000
Here, make yourself useful.

1469
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:06,500
Witnesses?

1471
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:13,450
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1472
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:17,350
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God

1473
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:20,100
and in the presence of these witnesses

1474
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:23,400
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1475
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:27,700
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,

1476
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:31,150
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1477
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,500
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife

1478
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:40,500
to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1479
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:46,300
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health

1480
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,550
and, forsaking all others,

1481
01:54:48,700 --> 01:54:52,700
keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1482
01:54:53,150 --> 01:54:55,250
I will.

1484
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:08,000
Good morning.

1485
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,300
They're a little young.

1486
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,050
That they are.

1487
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:20,400
They look a little nervous.

1488
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,150
I need all flight crews to report
to their designated areas immediately.

1489
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,250
- Major, can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1490
01:55:29,700 --> 01:55:31,400
Good morning.

1491
01:55:33,050 --> 01:55:34,700
<i>Good morning.</i>

1492
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,700
In less than an hour...

1493
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:44,500
aircraft from here will join
others from around the world.

1494
01:55:44,650 --> 01:55:50,200
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1495
01:55:52,050 --> 01:55:53,100
Mankind.

1496
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,100
That word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1497
01:55:58,600 --> 01:56:01,850
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1498
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,500
We will be united in our common interest.

1499
01:56:07,350 --> 01:56:11,400
Perhaps it's fate that
today is the 4th of July.

1500
01:56:12,600 --> 01:56:15,900
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1501
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:20,400
Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.

1502
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,050
But from annihilation.

1503
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,500
We're fighting for our right to live.

1504
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:31,450
To exist.

1505
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,700
And should we win the day,

1506
01:56:35,550 --> 01:56:39,900
the 4th of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,

1507
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:44,100
but as the day when the world
declared in one voice...

1508
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:47,000
"We will not go quietly into the night!

1509
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:50,500
"We will not vanish without a fight!

1510
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:53,550
"We're going to live on!

1511
01:56:54,150 --> 01:56:56,250
"We're going to survive!"

1512
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,050
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1514
01:57:26,050 --> 01:57:28,700
- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

1515
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,200
I've got your gear over here.

1515
01:57:30,400 --> 01:57:31,400
Good luck!

1516
01:57:31,550 --> 01:57:34,200
I've got you a jumpsuit for you, and the rest
of your gear is stored away in this duffel.

1516
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:35,850
You've got your choice of helmets.

1517
01:57:38,500 --> 01:57:41,150
Mr. President, I'd sure like to know
what you're doing.

1518
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:43,850
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1519
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:48,250
I belong in the air.

1520
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:57,450
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.
Right over here.

1521
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,850
You know, as soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1522
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:13,950
Here. Take these.

1523
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,200
Just in case.

1524
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:21,000
Where's...

1525
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,800
Just in case.

1526
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:38,100
I'm very proud of you.

1527
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:52,150
Be careful, okay?

1528
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:00,000
It's time.

1529
01:59:05,550 --> 01:59:06,800
I love you.

1530
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:08,950
I love you.

1531
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,500
Oh, damn! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1532
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:19,400
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't... I never...
- Here, here!

1533
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:21,600
Take these. My last two.

1534
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:24,850
You are a lifesaver.

1535
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:27,800
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1536
01:59:45,500 --> 01:59:47,000
<i>Good morning, Dave.</i>

1536
01:59:55,550 --> 01:59:57,800
- <i>Missile launch.</i>
- Oh, crap!

1537
01:59:58,450 --> 02:00:00,050
What do I hit? Which one?

1538
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:05,000
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.

1539
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:22,650
This is our victory dance.

1540
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,900
Not until the fat lady sings.

1541
02:00:25,050 --> 02:00:27,550
Oh! Yes, okay.

1542
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:29,050
This is important.

1543
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:31,700
Fat lady. I gotcha.

1544
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:35,750
<i>Open launch tunnel.</i>

1545
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:57,900
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1546
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Just make sure your seat backs and tray
tables are in their upright and lock position.

1547
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:02,600
Yeah. Is it?

1548
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,600
Let's rock 'n' roll.

1549
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:11,250
Oh!

1550
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:15,500
Oops.

1551
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:17,800
Oops? What does that mean?
What do you mean...

1552
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,900
No, I got it. Look, some jerk
didn't put the diagram right.

1553
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
- I know what I mean.
- I'm fine.

1553
02:01:22,100 --> 02:01:23,900
What do you mean saying "oops" there?

1554
02:01:24,050 --> 02:01:26,550
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1555
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:29,450
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

1556
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,150
Thataway!

1557
02:01:38,150 --> 02:01:40,450
I have got to get me one of these!

1558
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,500
No, no, no! What was that?
What was that? Don't do that!

1559
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:54,700
Just trying to get a feel for the old girl,
that's all.

1560
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:56,500
Oh, no, no, don't. Leave her alone. Really.

1561
02:01:56,600 --> 02:01:58,500
- Look, no hands.
- Steve!

1562
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,550
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1563
02:02:05,700 --> 02:02:09,300
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1564
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:12,100
- <i>Which way they headed?</i>
- I think our secret's out.

1565
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:13,850
They're headed straight for us.

1566
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:16,500
<i>ETA, 26 minutes.</i>

1567
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,550
You still with me over there?

1568
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:24,000
What the hell was I thinking?

1569
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,700
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1570
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,300
Head straight for it.

1571
02:02:57,150 --> 02:02:59,550
- What the hell?
- Don't touch them. Don't, don't, don't!

1572
02:02:59,700 --> 02:03:01,300
I was counting on this.

1573
02:03:01,450 --> 02:03:03,550
They are bringing us in.

1574
02:03:04,500 --> 02:03:08,400
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1575
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,900
We've got to work on our communication.

1576
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:30,050
We have visual.

1577
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:32,300
Do not engage until we've confirmed...

1578
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:34,600
- <i>...the package has been delivered.</i>
- Roger.

1579
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:42,750
Major, what happens if that thing gets here,

1580
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,400
before the virus is planted?

1581
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,150
Well, ma'am, this facility's
buried deep within a mountain.

1582
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:51,150
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1583
02:03:51,300 --> 02:03:53,400
What about the people outside?

1584
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,250
Lieutenant Sell, we got incoming.

1585
02:05:02,650 --> 02:05:04,150
Oh, my God!

1586
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:38,800
Look at that!

1587
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:50,450
There must be thousands of them.

1588
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:53,200
Millions of them.
What the hell are they doing?

1589
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:56,400
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1590
02:06:23,900 --> 02:06:27,000
Hey, I don't like this.
This is stupid. They can see us!

1591
02:06:27,100 --> 02:06:28,950
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This thing comes fully loaded.

1592
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:32,000
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...

1593
02:06:32,150 --> 02:06:34,200
power windows.

1594
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:51,600
Come on, baby.

1595
02:06:54,050 --> 02:06:56,000
We're in.

1596
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,150
Do it. Do it.

1597
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:04,600
Do it.

1598
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,000
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1599
02:07:07,150 --> 02:07:09,400
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1600
02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:11,500
<i>Stand by to engage.</i>

1601
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,150
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1602
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:21,500
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1603
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,900
We need everyone to grab
everything they can.

1604
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:27,950
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1605
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:32,650
The virus is in.

1606
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:41,300
All we can do now is... pray.

1607
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:46,050
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go! It's a go!

1608
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,500
Eagle One. Fox three.

1609
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,350
Gentlemen, this is it.

1610
02:07:57,700 --> 02:07:59,500
Come on, come on, come on.

1611
02:08:12,500 --> 02:08:14,350
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1612
02:08:14,500 --> 02:08:16,400
- Get your people out of there.
- Disengage.

1613
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,550
<i>Rear flank, follow suit.</i>

1614
02:08:19,850 --> 02:08:22,000
<i>Hold on, Command.</i>

1615
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:26,300
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1616
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:29,850
Eagle One. Fox three.

1617
02:08:43,900 --> 02:08:44,500
Direct hit!

1618
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:48,000
It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!
Fire at will! Fire at will!

1620
02:08:48,450 --> 02:08:51,200
We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take flight.

1621
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:54,600
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1622
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,750
Eagle One. Fox two.

1623
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,400
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1624
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:10,700
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1625
02:09:11,300 --> 02:09:12,800
Prepare to engage!

1626
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:21,100
All right, Mr. President! Here we go!

1627
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,250
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1628
02:09:25,300 --> 02:09:27,600
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?!

1629
02:09:29,550 --> 02:09:31,800
Okay. Job's done. Let's go home.

1630
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:34,100
Gladly.

1631
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:38,750
What's up?

1632
02:09:39,250 --> 02:09:40,450
It's stuck.

1633
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,650
- What?!
- It's not responding. It's stuck.

1634
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,100
Try it again.

1635
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:01,300
Come on, come on!

1638
02:10:33,700 --> 02:10:35,300
Steve, Steve!

1639
02:10:41,150 --> 02:10:43,750
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- It's not me, they're overriding the system.

1640
02:10:44,650 --> 02:10:46,150
Oh, shit!

1641
02:10:47,300 --> 02:10:48,400
Hide.

1642
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:56,850
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1643
02:10:57,750 --> 02:10:58,950
Come on in.

1644
02:11:02,650 --> 02:11:04,100
I'm not Jewish.

1645
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,350
Nobody's perfect.

1646
02:11:09,600 --> 02:11:12,150
God! Where are they?

1647
02:11:21,150 --> 02:11:23,650
This could be our last night on Earth.

1648
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:28,650
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1649
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:37,650
If we do, we'll both die virgins.

1650
02:11:38,150 --> 02:11:40,250
But at least we'll be together.

1651
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:50,800
Are you scared?

1652
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:52,500
Me, too.

1653
02:11:54,350 --> 02:11:56,000
Eagle Seven, fox two.

1653
02:11:56,500 --> 02:11:58,000
Eagle Three, fox two.

1654
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,000
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're just not causing enough damage.

1655
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:09,850
It's settling directly over us.

1656
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,350
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon.

1657
02:12:21,500 --> 02:12:24,000
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.

1658
02:12:29,500 --> 02:12:31,350
Target at 12 o'clock.

1659
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:35,050
My God, they're everywhere!

1660
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:39,000
- Bandits on our tail! They're locked on!
- I see them. I see them.

1661
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:44,650
All right, squadron leaders,
I want a weapons check.

1662
02:12:46,350 --> 02:12:48,900
You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!

1663
02:12:52,250 --> 02:12:54,750
I'm in range. Locking on.

1664
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,850
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1665
02:13:07,750 --> 02:13:09,400
That is a negative impact.

1666
02:13:09,500 --> 02:13:11,700
<i>That is an NI. Negative impact.</i>

1667
02:13:12,350 --> 02:13:14,650
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1668
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:16,350
I'm on it.

1669
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:20,400
Oh, Jesus!

1670
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:24,900
Sir, all missiles have been fired.

1670
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:26,300
You're out of time!
Get your ass out of there!

1671
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:28,850
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1672
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:30,900
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1673
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:33,400
<i>Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!</i>

1674
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:38,400
Kind of got hung up back there!

1675
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,850
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1676
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:43,500
I'm packing!

1677
02:13:44,950 --> 02:13:47,050
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1678
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,500
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- <i>It's me!</i>

1679
02:13:49,650 --> 02:13:51,250
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>

1680
02:13:52,050 --> 02:13:54,050
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1681
02:13:54,250 --> 02:13:57,300
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>

1682
02:13:57,450 --> 02:14:01,100
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven,
take flanking positions.

1682
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:02,600
I want you to look after this guy, okay?

1683
02:14:03,050 --> 02:14:07,000
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1684
02:14:07,200 --> 02:14:09,450
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!

1685
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,400
We'll draw them off and it'll be all yours!

1686
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,650
Look out! Coming through!

1687
02:14:24,250 --> 02:14:25,700
I've got tone.

1688
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:30,350
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1689
02:14:37,550 --> 02:14:39,350
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1690
02:14:42,650 --> 02:14:44,050
It's jammed.

1691
02:14:45,050 --> 02:14:46,900
<i>It won't fire.</i>

1692
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,450
Damn it!

1693
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,250
Do me a favor.

1694
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:10,050
Tell my children I love them very much.

1695
02:15:13,100 --> 02:15:15,300
All right, you alien assholes!

1696
02:15:16,350 --> 02:15:18,950
In the words of my generation...

1697
02:15:19,100 --> 02:15:23,000
Up yours!

1698
02:15:23,550 --> 02:15:24,950
Dad! What's he doing?

1699
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:26,350
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

1700
02:15:26,550 --> 02:15:28,650
Come on, baby, come on!

1701
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:33,000
Good luck, buddy.

1702
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Hello, boys!

1702
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:48,000
I'm back!

1703
02:16:06,750 --> 02:16:08,550
He did it!

1704
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:10,700
The son of a bitch did it!

1705
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,900
All right!

1706
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,600
What your father did was very brave.

1707
02:16:41,300 --> 02:16:43,100
You should be proud of him.

1708
02:16:43,800 --> 02:16:45,400
I am.

1709
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:05,000
Now we know how to take them out, general.

1709
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,350
Spread the word.

1710
02:17:10,350 --> 02:17:13,800
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1711
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,250
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1712
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,450
What do you think?

1713
02:17:34,300 --> 02:17:35,850
Checkmate.

1714
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:04,800
Well, it's funny. I always thought
that things like these would kill me.

1715
02:18:09,050 --> 02:18:10,550
Thank you.

1716
02:18:18,350 --> 02:18:19,950
It's been a pleasure.

1717
02:18:20,900 --> 02:18:22,850
Steve, you too.

1718
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:28,750
Only one thing left to do.

1719
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:36,250
Ready?

1720
02:18:36,400 --> 02:18:38,050
Yes, sir.

1721
02:18:44,450 --> 02:18:47,700
Hey, all right! Look at us!

1722
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:51,100
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1723
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:52,300
Y'all take care, all right?

1723
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,400
- Nothing but love for you!
- Goodbye!

1724
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:54,250
Nothing but love for you.

1725
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:58,400
Do you think they have any clue
what's about to happen to them?

1726
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:00,950
Not a chance in hell. Good night!

1727
02:19:08,150 --> 02:19:09,200
Peace!

1728
02:19:23,450 --> 02:19:25,650
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?

1729
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:27,150
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1730
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:29,850
Forget the fat lady. You're obessed
with the fat lady. Drive us out of here!

1731
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,250
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really! You think?

1732
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:50,200
Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.

1732
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:52,450
We're not hit! We're not hit!
Stop side-seat driving!

1733
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:58,650
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit, exit, left!

1734
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:01,650
- Where the hell do you think I'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...

1735
02:20:20,400 --> 02:20:21,900
Uh-oh. They're closing up on us.

1735
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
- Is that closing?
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

1736
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:28,000
Must go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1739
02:20:39,350 --> 02:20:41,450
Elvis has left the building!

1740
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,600
Thank you very much.

1741
02:20:43,750 --> 02:20:45,850
I love you, man.

1742
02:22:16,800 --> 02:22:20,050
They're going down all over the world,
Tom. We got them beat.

1743
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:22,950
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1744
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:32,300
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1745
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,150
Hold it!

1746
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:39,450
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1747
02:23:26,700 --> 02:23:28,600
Sorry, sir.

1748
02:23:29,350 --> 02:23:30,600
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1749
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:33,500
- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1750
02:23:41,050 --> 02:23:42,300
David...

1751
02:23:44,650 --> 02:23:46,400
Not bad.

1752
02:23:49,550 --> 02:23:52,200
Thank you, Mr. President.

1753
02:23:53,050 --> 02:23:54,900
Not too bad at all.

1754
02:23:56,050 --> 02:23:58,150
Oh, so this is healthy?

1755
02:23:58,650 --> 02:24:00,700
Oh, I could get used to it.

1756
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:21,100
Happy 4th of July, Daddy.

1757
02:24:21,300 --> 02:24:23,350
Same to you, Munchkin.

1758
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,550
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1759
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:29,100
Yeah.

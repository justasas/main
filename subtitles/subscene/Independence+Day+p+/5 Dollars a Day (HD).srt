How do you do that?

184
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,365
- Well, l'm the guy
who makes sure

185
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,326
there's no mouse turds
in your salad

186
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,494
when you go to a restaurant.

187
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,704
- That's good.

188
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,122
- What? This is the coffee?

189
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,791
- Yeah.

190
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,958
Help yourself.

191
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,507
l need you to drive me
to New Mexico.

192
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,050
- [laughs]

193
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,676
- There's a treatment
down there,

194
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,804
some kind of experimental
holistic thing.

195
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,473
They dunk you in mud,
do chanting.

196
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,682
l don't know.

197
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,935
They need volunteers,
so l get a freebie.

198
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,562
Maybe it's
a waste of time,

199
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,565
but l figure,
what the heck?

200
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,484
Won't take
more than a week, tops.

201
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,402
- A week?

202
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,570
Are you serious?

203
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,572
- Yeah.
- l'm not taking you.

204
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,949
Why can't you
drive yourself?

205
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,116
- Drive myself?

206
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,829
This thing's
messing with my vision.

207
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,330
- Why can't you get
somebody else?

208
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:53,790
Don't you have any friends?

209
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,043
- None that
l don't owe money to.

210
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,212
- So take a plane.
You got all those vouchers.

211
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,421
Why don't you use them?

212
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,382
- Doctor says altitude's bad
also for my brain.

213
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,550
Makes for swelling.

214
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,843
Turn in here.

215
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,512
l want to show you something.

216
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,975
[buzzer buzzing]

217
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:14,936
Hey.

218
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,145
- Hey, Nat.
- Marty.

219
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,313
Meet my son.

220
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,773
- What a thrill.

221
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,859
- Nice to meet you.

222
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,653
- Marty's been storing it for me
in his humidor.

223
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,905
lt keeps it soft.

224
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,907
Here,
try it on.

225
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,254
Hm?

226
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,673
What do you
think it's worth?

227
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:44,841
- l don't know.

228
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,926
- Take a guess.

229
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,094
- Nothing.

230
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,932
- This is one of four jackets
worn by Steve McQueen

231
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,434
in The Great Escape.

232
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,770
- Where'd you get this?

233
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,857
- Bert Kruger.

234
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,191
You probably
don't remember him.

235
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,653
He had car dealerships
when you were a kid.

236
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,197
Kruger Motors.
No.

237
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,824
Your mother worked there.

238
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,745
Anyway, he won the jacket
in some charity raffle.

239
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,079
He gave it
to your mother.

240
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,583
She left it behind
when we broke up.

241
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,295
l was going to sell it,
but then l thought, "No,

242
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,965
"l keep it for Flynny.

243
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,260
lf he wants,
after l die, he can sell it."

244
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,428
lt's a nest egg.

245
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,638
- lt's a bribe.

246
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,931
- lt's a jacket.

247
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,517
A nice jacket.

248
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,062
Looks good on you,
don't you think?

249
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,272
Thanks, Marty.

250
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,330
l have to know,
are you my wheel man or what?

251
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,917
- Jeez.

252
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,587
You know, you're really
putting me on the spot here.

253
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,255
l mean, l got a job.

254
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,423
l got commitments.

255
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,092
l only brought
an overnight bag.

256
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,094
- The fact is,
l don't want you to do this.

257
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,303
l need you to.

258
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,681
l need to make things
copasetic between us.

259
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,349
l know l've been
a terrible father.

260
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,144
lt's not a thing
l can ignore.

261
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,355
Sometimes,
for no particular reason,

262
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,818
life hauls off
and knocks you flat,

263
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,528
slams you so hard
against the ground,

264
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,780
you think that all your insides
are busted.

265
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:36,327
But if you look for something
to replace what's broken,

266
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,456
if you're lucky,
you can find it.

267
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,461
You're all l have.

268
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,476
- You really
got a brain tumor?

269
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,854
- You think l'd kid around
about a tumor?

270
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,856
- l do.

271
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,570
- Come on.

272
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:16,034
Just say yes.

273
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,201
- All right.

274
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,078
All right.
- You're the one.

275
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,621
- All right.

276
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,415
- You're pure,
pure flame.

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,583
- l'll drive you.

278
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,751
- Blood is thick.

279
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,502
- All right.
All right.

280
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,629
- Know what l'm saying?
- You behave.

281
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,742
- And these glue traps
are just plain gross.

282
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:02,914
High technology arrives
with the push--

283
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,293
- Thing you do now
is try and forget it.

284
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,836
- How, Pa?

285
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,130
How you gonna
forget something like that?

286
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,007
- What l'm trying to say is,

287
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,383
now and then,

288
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,512
for no good reason
a man can figure out,

289
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,222
life will just. . .

290
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,974
haul off
and knock him flat,

291
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,518
slam him again'
the ground so hard

292
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,770
it seems like
all his insides is busted.

293
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,564
And you start looking around
for something good

294
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,191
to take the place
of the bad.

295
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,944
As a general rule,
you can find it.

296
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,628
- Think you packed enough?

297
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,714
- Cool, no?

298
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,466
New regulations
at the airlines

299
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,803
say you got 60 days
to pick up unclaimed baggage.

300
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,012
After that. . .

301
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,849
♪ You belong to me ♪

302
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,350
This is the good stuff.

303
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,852
Louis Vuitton.

304
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,980
You're not
going to be sorry.

305
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,815
l got this
so totally worked out.

306
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,860
And you don't have to dip
in your pocket for a thing,

307
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,070
zip, zilch,
not a crouton.

308
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:20,074
This trip's on me,
ever last pillow chocolate.

309
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,534
- That is good news.

310
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,702
- Of course.

311
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,371
l got us set up
in five-star places.

312
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,539
Wait'll you see.

313
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,626
You're going
to be shocked and awed.

314
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,794
Let's go.

315
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,859
- What ZlP code
did you park in?

316
00:19:56,486 --> 00:20:00,323
- Oh, here's our ride.

317
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,490
- Are you shittin' me?

318
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,203
- Free wheels and gas
for a year.

319
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,246
All l have to do
is drive 1 ,000 miles a month.

320
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,832
- No way.
No, no, no.

321
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,000
- Why not?

322
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,252
- No, l'm not getting in there.
l'm not getting in that.

323
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,462
- Don't be a snob.

324
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,883
- No.

325
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,051
You know what?

326
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,428
You are completely insane.

327
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,263
You're gone.
- Going, going, gone.

328
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,142
Get in the car.

329
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,580
- Don't--
don't put that there.

330
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,666
Put that over here.

331
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,796
No, don't put that on.
That stinks.

332
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,840
- What about your Maggie?

333
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,008
ls it serious?

334
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,843
'Cause she's
answering your telephone.

335
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,971
- lt is.

336
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,472
- Don't do what l did.

337
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,848
Don't let go
of something special,

338
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,936
'cause, in my experience,
it comes along once.

339
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,647
- Okay.
Thanks for the advice.

340
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,733
- She dumped you, right?

341
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,821
Yeah, l'm psychic.

342
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,572
Turn in here.

343
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,824
We need to make a stop.

344
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,075
- What, you got to take a piss?

345
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,618
- No, make a right.
l got a surprise.

346
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:29,870
Just make a right.

347
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,580
- What kind of surprise?

348
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,873
We just got on the road.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,875
l was feeling good.

350
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,048
- Little trim, a spruce-up,
get back on the highway.

351
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,300
- l don't need a little trim.

352
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,927
- l promise you,
these women are good,

353
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,345
and it's not
going to cost a dime.

354
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,513
What the heck?

355
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,098
They don't have their license?
Big deal.

356
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,058
They're about to be
very good at what they do.

357
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,730
- Mm.

358
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,568
- Yeah.

359
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,528
There you go.

360
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,781
Yeah, Nat is one

He's up for anything.
- Oh, yeah?

362
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,786
- He let me put his hair
in a Mohawk last summer.

363
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,996
- No.

364
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,206
l bet it was great
growing up with a dad like that.

365
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,125
- Yeah.

366
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,668
- You know,
if it wasn't for Nat,

367
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,295
l wouldn't be here.

368
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,172
Tuition's real pricey.

369
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,423
- What, he paid your tuition?

370
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,009
- Not exactly.

371
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,178
But he knew
a guy whose wife

372
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,056
was having a hard time
getting knocked up,

373
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,517
so your dad thought of me,
if you know what l mean.

374
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,895
- l'm afraid to ask.

375

for a new car too.

you actually paid for something?

410

- You know how much
l'm out-of-pocket

411

That works out
to under $5 a day.

417
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,195
- Well, if you stopped eating,
you'd cut it down to three.

418
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,489
- Do you know how many people
could do what l'm doing?

419
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,950
You may see
a curious old person,

420

but l see
a good-looking older guy

421
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,164

work for him.

and a Chevron station

He died years ago.

guilty of grand larceny.

00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:12,411
The thing is,
l'm not from Canada.

541
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,581
l was born in Secaucus,
New Jersey.

542
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,666
l don't have
any brothers or sisters.

543
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,959
l grew up
without a mother

544
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,128
because my father
drove her away.

545
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,462
l--

546
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,298
- Promotional period ended.

547
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,842
To purchase additional minutes,
press 7.

548
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:30,554
[dial tone]

549
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,167
- Hello?

550
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,181
Nat!

551
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:15,891
- l got a gun!

552
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,059
Whoa.

553
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,518
Richie.

554
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,686
- Don't call me Richie.

555
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:21,021
- Flynny.

556
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,272
Always good
to see you.

557
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,815
Oh.

558
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,485
l slept
like a polar bear.

559
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,694
So good.

560
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,904
- l need coffee.

561
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,407
- There's a wonderful motel
83 miles away.

562
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,452
Comps on coffee
and Danish.

563
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:39,873
The 7-Eleven.

564
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,000
- Or we could
buy a cup now.

565
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,210
- We're doing
so good here.

566
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,673
Let's not blow it
on luxury items.

567
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,966
[grunting]

568
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,055
Come on.
Come on.

569
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,223
- Perfect.

570
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,566
- Take it easy.
Take it easy.

571
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,818
- Lovely.

572
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,029
And it is just
the safest neighborhood.

573
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,075
- Hi.
- Hello.

574
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,202
- Can l help you?

575
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,954
- Wish you could, darling.

576
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,664
The house is wonderful.
We like it.

577
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,457
The fact is,
my partner and l

578
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:25,293
are looking for something
a little more feng shui-ish.

579
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,338
The house is wonderful,
though, isn't it?

580
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,506
Vaulted ceilings.

581
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,674
- Take it easy, honey.

582
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,342
lt's the first place we've seen.

583
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,886
- lt's got everything.
Thank you.

584
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,936
[tires squealing]

585
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,104
Yikes.

586
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,232
We escaped.

587
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,507
Last time l drove
across country,

588
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:13,675
it took me four days.

589
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,094
Did l tell you that?
- No.

590
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,346
- A lifetime ago.

591
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,932
Four perfect days.

592
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,436
We wound up on a beach
in Mexico, freezing.

593
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,106
White sand,
clear blue water,

594
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,069
your mother looking up at me
like l was the one.

595
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,238
That's when l asked her
to marry me.

596
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:38,075
Then we did it,

597
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,910
twice, maybe three times.

598
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,705
Yeah, shake your head.

599
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:44,915
These are memories.

600
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,292
You'll see what it's like

601
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,879
when things stop happening
on command.

602
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,632
Half mast.

603
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,301
l'm not even dead yet.

604
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,011
- What are you saying,
you're impotent?

605
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:01,640
- l'm saying, l can't get it up
most of the time.

606
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,808
- Since when?

607
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,101
- Since. . .

608
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,436
Uh, it's hard to say.

609
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,105
Couple of years,
maybe five.

610
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,898
- Well, have you tried
taking those pills?

611
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,900
- They're junk.
They don't work.

612
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,485
- Where'd you buy them,
off a fruit truck?

613
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,653
- What difference
does it make?

614
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,987
They don't work.
l don't work.

615
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,614
Clock's ticking.

616
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,576
One last frolic is not
going to stop that, is it?

617
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,365
- Use this for the gas.

618
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,992
The Sweet 'N Low people
will pick it up.

619
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,785
Be back in a flash.

620
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,708
[horn honks]

621
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,590
Room service, please.

622
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,217
- Room service.
How may l help you?

623
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,763
- Yes, we'd like to order up
some brunch, my wife and l.

624
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,056
- What room, please?

625
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,600
- Room 1 20.

626
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,767
- All right.

627
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,811
- Thank you so much.
- Please hold.

628
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,771
- Yes, l'll wait.

629
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,066
Thank you.

630
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,657
Sir.

631
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:46,912
Could you leave the tray
outside the door?

632
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,830
My wife is under the weather,

633
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,375
and l'm trying
not to disturb her.

634
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,543
Thank you so much.

635
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,963
May l add the tip
to the check?

636
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,131
- Sure.

637
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,929
- There.
That's for you.

638
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,389
Thank you so much.

639
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,934
- Thank you, sir.
- Please.

640
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,727
Thank you.

641
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,904
[line ringing]

642
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,200
- Hi, this is Maggie.
Please leave a message.

643
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,368
[machine beeps]

644
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,453
- Hey, it's me.

645
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,747
Are you there?

646
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:34,251
Are you there?
Are you there? Are you there?

647
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,921
Okay, another confession.

648
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:42,300
Um, this is. . .

649
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,053
This is a little tricky.

650
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,181
l'm gonna--l'm gonna tell you
a story, okay?

651
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,391
Here we go.

652
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,434
My father
drove a beat-up Mustang

653
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,186
with 1 50,000 miles on it,

654
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,272
about the time a sane person
buys a new car.

655
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,439
But not him.

656
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,316
He rents a new Mustang,

657
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,403
strips it, and swaps the parts
with his hunk of junk.

658
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,989
Then he returns the rental,
complains it's a lemon,

659
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,658
and gets his $69 back.

660
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,618
But guess what.

661
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,831
This time,
they nailed him.

662
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,042
And guess what else.

663
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,837
My name was on the lease.

664
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,005
Okay?

665
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,258
You can guess the rest.

666
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,349
All right.

667
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,518
l'm going to call you back.

668
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,029
- l'm thinking
about those lobster dinners

669
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,698
we pinched from that place
up in Bar Harbor.

670
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:47,949
Could you forget the taste,

671
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,410
the flavor,
the freshness?

672
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,954
lt was like the ocean.

673
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,122
Eat something.

674
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:57,125
You can't
live on coffee.

675
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,293
- l'm tired.

676
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,628
- You're depressed.

677
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,256
Anybody in your situation's
got to feel like junk.

678
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,676
The trick is to take your mind
off getting dumped.

679
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,179
Every obstacle
is an opportunity.

680
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,390
Think about it this way.

681
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,642
You have a clean slate.

682
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,019
No girl.
No job.

683
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:20,982
No nothing
to hold you back.

684
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,359
- How did you know
about my job?

685
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,947
You sent that letter
to the health department?

686
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,284
- The whole thing
was beneath you.

687
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,161
- You got me fired.

688
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,496
- l did you a favor.

689
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,999
You want to spend the next
30 years punching a clock?

690
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,294
Huh?

691
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,630
Things are out there.

692
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,298
Hm?

693
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,592
Life is out there.

694
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,847
One day,
you're going to say thank you.

695
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:54,766
Thank you, Dad.

696
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,936
Oh, it was nothing.

697
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,270
What's wrong?

698
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,856
Come on, Flynn.

699
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,483
Don't be so serious, huh?

700
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,901
What are you doing?

701
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,194
- What am l doing?

702
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,404
l'm spending the night

703
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,696


in a room
that you're paying for.

704
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:09,906
And then tomorrow,

705
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,616
l'm on the first train,
bus, or pickup truck

706
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,536
the hell out of here.

707
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,830
Yeah.

708
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:32,637
- Your mother and l got married
in a HoJo's.

709
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:35,974
They wanted $800
for the banquet room.

710
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,725
Back then,

711
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,270
good for me,

712
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:46,901
l was able to swing a deal
with the night manager.

713
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:51,906
We had a tasteful,
low-key ceremony in the lobby

714
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,992
for $50.

715
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,370
Who knew the difference?

716
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,123
Who could tell
the difference?

717
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,134
Flynn?

718
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,055
l'm going to go
have a drink. . .

719
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,728
Meet some people,

720
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,022

The entire agency is corrupt.

- What question mark?

976
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,854
- The symbol,
the question mark,

977
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,772
like at the end of a sentence,
it's a question.

978
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,774
- Like in grammar?
- Yeah.

979
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,402

a hieroglyphic symbol

which came from the view
of the ass of a cat

- Explain.

983
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,619
- Well, because when a cat
walks away from you,

984
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,786
you feel insecure;

985
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,663
you're unsure of yourself;
it's doubt.

Oh, l know.

You're shutting down

- They're extra large,
jumbo.

1079
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,867
Okay, sugar shorts,
let's hit the road.

1080
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:55,202
- Let's do it.

1081
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,412
- Hold down the fort.

1082
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,208
- l'm gonna clean the kitchen.

1083
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,091
[blender whirring]

1084
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,640
Perfect.

1085
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,227
- So. . .

1086
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,731
l take you're not
still babysitting.

1087
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,899
- Why, do you need one?

1088
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,152
- Mm, from time to time, yeah.

1089
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,115
So what are you doing?

1090
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,616
- This and that.

1091
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1092
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,453
Got my notary's license.

1093
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,620
- Did you?
- Mm-hmm.

1094
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,913
- Congratulations.

1095
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,667
- Well, it was Nat's idea.

1096
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,212
He's so thoughtful.

1097
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,548
Remember when he got me
that pink briefcase

1098
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,216
when l graduated high school?

1099
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,719
- Yeah, l also remember
he didn't pay for it.

1100
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,471
- lt was still nice.

1101
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,514
- All right.

1102
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,814
- You used to have
the most pitiful crush on me.

1103
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,733
- l did not.

1104
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,902
- l was your dream girl.

1105
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:12,738
- Yeah, all right,
you were.

1106
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,364
- [chuckles]

1107
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,371
Remember when l used
to give you those bubbles baths?

1108
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:23,499
- Vaguely.

1109
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:25,501
- [chuckling]

1110
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,877
You still take baths?

1111
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,004
- Mm-mm.

1112
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,172
- Showers.

1113
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,340
- Uh-huh.

1114
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,925
With other people?

1115
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,593
- Sometimes lots of people.

1116
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,220
- [chuckling]

1117
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,224
- Of course, there was always
a guard watching.

1118
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,725
- There's no guards here,
Flynny.

1119
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,022
- You never did it with Nat. . .

1120
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,482
- Uh-oh.
- Did you?

1121
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,609
- Oh. . .

1122
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,695
- That was a--

1123
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:56,073
that was a no, right?

1124
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,783
- Right.

1125
00:58:57,909 --> 00:59:00,285
Though l can't say
l didn't think about it.

1126
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,162
- Mm.

1127
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:09,002
- Just never met a man who was
so in love with his wife.

1128
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,340
l used to sit
on my front porch

1129
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:17,386
and watch them dance
in the living room.

1130
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,514
l can't say,
if things weren't different,

1131
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,809
l wouldn't have. . .

1132
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,894
The man deserved
a little love and affection.

1133
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,355
- Why?

1134
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,858
- Because of the way
she treated him.

1135
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,611
- What are you talking about?

1136
00:59:34,737 --> 00:59:35,821
He drove her away.

1137
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,407
- He didn't drive her away.
- Yes, he did.

1138
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,207
- l don't know what he told you,

1139
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,334
but she left him
for another man.

1140
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:52,838
- What?

1141
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,049
- That candy-ass
that she used to work for

1142
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,217
at the car dealership.

1143
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,427
- What, Kruger?

1144
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:04,933
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1145
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:09,021
She did not.

1146
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,772
l would've known.

1147
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:15,736
- Everybody in the town knew,
Flynn.

1148
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,075
Nearly broke that man in two.

1149
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,204
You were just a kid.

1150
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:31,418
And of course, Kruger
moved on to greener pastures.

1151
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:39,635
And, you know. . .

1152
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:46,892
- She died.

1153
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,519
- [exhales]

1154
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,647
Probably shouldn't
have told you.

1155
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,400
- lt's okay.

1156
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:56,902
- l'm sorry.
- Your coffee, ma'am.

1157
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,111
- Hey.

1158
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:00,906
Ow!

1159
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,074
- Are you all right?

1160
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,618
Hey, can we get
some napkins here?

1161
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,827
- Oh.

1162
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:08,288
- What happened?

1163
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:10,749
He very nearly
burned me to death.

1164
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,459
- Please, ma'am, anything
that we can do

1165
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,586
to solve the problem,
we'll be more than happy to.

1166
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:15,962
- There is.

1167
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,589
And you will be
hearing from me.

1168
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:18,799
You will.

1169
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,634
And it will not be
for a refill.

1170
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,469
He saw it.
Did you see it?

1171
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,221
- Yes, yes.

1172
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,015
- Would you take me home?

1173
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,687
What are you, kidding?

1174
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,438
Get a lawyer.

1175
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,606
- l didn't--

1176
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,902
So l got my Mercedes

1177
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:41,405
with a trip and a slip
at the supermarket last year.

1178
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,031
This?

1179
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:46,451
This ought to be worth 5 grand
and maybe a new wardrobe.

1180
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,953
- Well, in that case,

1181
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,081
you don't mind if l ask
for my 20 dollars back, do you?

1182
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:58,088
Nat!

1183
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,300
What are you doing?

1184
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,971
What are you doing, man?

1185
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:10,100
[water splashing]

1186
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,484
- Guys?

1187
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,656
- Sensory dep.

1188
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:28,076
lt's so soothing.

1189
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,079
lt's better
than meditating.

1190
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,706
- Hi, baby.

1191
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,291
- Wah!

1192
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:00,025
- Hm.

1193
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,693
Hey.

1194
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,196
- Hey.

1195
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,297
- Nighty-night, Flynny.

1196
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,279
Comfy?

1197
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:47,906
- Hi.

1198
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:49,074
- Hey.

1199
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:56,623
l got that mattress from
that sexual harassment thingy,

1200
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,500
from Price Breakers
last summer.

1201
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,377
- A Sealy Posturepedic.

1202
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,753
The good stuff.

1203
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,755
- Mm-hmm.

1204
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:07,592
Nice, huh?

1205
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,219
lt's nice and springy.

1206
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,179
- Yeah, it's a wonderful
mattress.

1207
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,765
- Mm-hmm.

1208
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,100
- He's not here, you know?

1209
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:17,018
He's on the couch.

1210
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,812
- l know.

1211
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:23,608
l know.

1212
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,152
- Okay.

1213
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,320
l'm verklempt.

1214
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,197
You are one
of the most exciting women

1215
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,699
l've ever been this close to,

1216
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,701
and normally, l'm a guy
who does what comes next,

1217
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,787
but in this case,
at the end of the day,

1218
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:36,955
it's too late.

1219
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,834
- No, it's not.

1220
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:42,794
- lt is.

1221
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:43,962
l have an idea.

1222
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:46,631
How about l give you
a supply of calling cards,

1223
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:51,553
30 minutes, including
weekends and holidays?

1224
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,557
- l already have
2,000 free minutes.

1225
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,684
- Wow.

1226
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,812
ls this because l'm dying?

1227
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,982
- This is because
you're a good man.

1228
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:05,275
- l used to be.

1229
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,360
- You still are.

1230
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,452
- Dolores?
- Yeah, baby?

1231
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,996
- l would deny you nothing,

1232
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:22,000
but this is not going to happen,
l promise you.

1233
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,460
lt's a fruitless effort.

1234
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,129
- Are you giving up that easy?

1235
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,173
- Oh.

1236
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,966
Oh. . .

1237
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,260
You think this is easy,

1238
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,930
for me to embarrass myself
this way?

1239
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,640
You should go.

1240
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:37,807
- No.

1241
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,975
No.

1242
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,143
[makes purring sounds]

1243
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,311
No.

1244
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,647
- Why?

1245
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,316
- The pink briefcase.

1246
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,659
- l've never heard it spoken of
in that way before.

1247
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,912
- You gave it to me
for my high school graduation.

1248
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,498
- That was a souvenir
of friendship.

1249
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:05,001
l. . .
l didn't even pay for it.

1250
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,337
- You're going
to pay for it now, buddy.

1251
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:08,505
- Mm.

1252
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,131
- Oh, Nat!

1253
01:06:10,257 --> 01:06:13,051
- Dolores.
Oh, Dolores.

1254
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:14,219
Whoa, golly.

1255
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,554
Whoa.

1256
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,723
- Yeah.

1257
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,559
[laughing]

1258
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,229
- Boom, boom, boom,
let's go back to my room.

1259
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:27,065
- [laughing]

1260
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,858
l'll give you another try.

1261
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,318
- You know,
don't like good-byes,

1262
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:32,028
no tears, no sighs.

1263
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:39,202
Thank you.

1264
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,249
Mighty hunter drive?

1265
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:16,281
What do you say to a chow-down
after a hard day's night?

1266
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,199
Pancakes,

1267
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:20,618
sausage patties,

1268
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,245
maple syrup!

1269
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,330
- You worked up
an appetite, huh?

1270
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,458
- Mm-hmm.

1271
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,268
- How come you never
told me about Kruger?

1272
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:52,150
- Did l tell you
he owes me $2,000?

1273
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:54,152
That's what l lent him
to open his first car lot,

1274
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:55,320
$2,000.

1275
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,654
And he stiffed me.

1276
01:07:56,781 --> 01:08:00,241
You know how many showrooms
Kruger has as we speak?

1277
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:01,659
23.

1278
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:05,914
And still, l haven't seen
dime one of my investment.

1279
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,166
He's not an honorable man.

1280
01:08:08,292 --> 01:08:11,920
- No, no, Kruger and Mom,
Kruger and Mom.

1281
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,430
How could you not tell me?

1282
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,516
- Tell you what?

1283
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,165
[blowing]

1284
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,626
- Oh, come on.

1285
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,546
[blowing]

1286
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,632
- Make a wish?

1287
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:02,345
- What was yours, running naked
on the beach again?

1288
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,264
- Nah.

1289
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:06,391
l already got mine.

1290
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:09,644
- l wish you weren't sick.

1291
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,321
What, are you on a diet?

1292
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,531
- lt's my cake.

1293
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,324
lt's for you.

1294
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:25,702
- Thanks.

1295
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:06,618
[urine trickling]

1296
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:14,125
So how you going
to stick it to him?

1297
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:15,752
- What do you mean?

1298
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,629
- Well, that's what
we're here for, isn't it?

1299
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:20,131
Get back at Kruger?

1300
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,842
- How'd you put that together?

1301
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,094
- l'm your son,
aren't l?

1302
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,203
Let me in on it.

1303
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:51,371
- Eh.

1304
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,249
l have to do this by myself.

1305
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,084
- l want to help.

1306
01:10:59,171 --> 01:11:01,631
- Meet me at the hotel, noonish.

1307
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:24,028
- Welcome to Kruger Motors.

1308
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,446
Beauty, isn't she?

1309
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:29,284
4.6-liter V8 engine,
320 horses.

1310
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,451
lnterested in a test drive?

1311
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:32,537
- No, thanks.
l have a meeting with BK.

1312
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:33,997
Nat Flynn.

1313
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,541
- He's very busy today.
lt could be a while.

1314
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,126
- l'm early.

1315
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:41,504
ls there a place to sit,
maybe some tea?

1316
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:45,300
Thanks.

1317
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:58,062
- Nat.

1318
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,398
- Bert.

1319
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:02,734
- Sit down.

1320
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,486
- Thanks.

1321
01:12:05,612 --> 01:12:06,946
Long time, no see.

1322
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,823
- [laughs]

1323
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:10,366
Not long enough.

1324
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:12,243
- A lot of spilt milk
under the bridge

1325
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,911
for the both of us,
l'm sure.

1326
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,079
How's your family?

1327
01:12:15,205 --> 01:12:16,372
Children and your wife?

1328
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,707
- They're great.

1329
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,168
- Bert junior must be
in college by now.

1330
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,377
- Michigan.

1331
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,087
- Yeah, your alma mater.

1332
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:24,339
Kudos.

1333
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,050
- Let's get down to it, Nat.

1334
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,385
- Sure.

1335
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:38,770
- Nice-looking boy.

1336
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,813
- He's all right.

1337
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,692
No chick magnet, not like us.

1338
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,447
First time they handed him
to met at the hospital,

1339
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:50,823
l got scared.

1340
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,117
What am l going to do
with a screaming, red-faced kid?

1341
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:56,245
But three seconds later,
l was in love with him.

1342
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,831
l wish l hadn't felt that way.

1343
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,711
lt should've been you, Bert.

1344
01:13:03,837 --> 01:13:05,963
- Look, Nat--

1345
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:10,009
- l understand you've got
a beautiful thing here,

1346
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:14,764
terrific family, new career.

1347
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,308
l'm not here to upset
any of that.

1348
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,143
All l care about is him.

1349
01:13:19,269 --> 01:13:22,230
l want him to have something,
a nest egg for when l'm gone.

1350
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,816
l haven't been able to do that
for him, but you could.

1351
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,612
Or we have to do this in court.

1352
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:35,284
And then it's a public thing.

1353
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:38,246
- How do l know
that in six months,

1354
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,415
you're not going to show up
on my front porch, Nat?

1355
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:44,335
- l'm not going to be here
six months from now, Bert.

1356
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:49,215
Look, check
with my oncologist.

1357
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:50,383
His number's on the back,

1358
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:54,345
if you want.

1359
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:55,513
- What about the kid?

1360
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:56,681
- He doesn't know.

1361
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:57,974
At this time of my life,

1362
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,935
the last thing l want is
to tell him l'm not his father.

1363
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:03,855
He may be a disaster,
but he's all l've got.

1364
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,356
lt pains me to say this,

1365
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,775
but there's something
wrong with him, Bert.

1366
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,611
l believe it.

1367
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:13,573
lt's my fault.

1368
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,036
- You don't look sick, Nat.

1369
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,621
[laughing]

1370
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:22,707
You haven't
changed at all.

1371
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,959
Same impeccable
sense of timing.

1372
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:26,377
You know, today's the day

1373
01:14:26,503 --> 01:14:29,255
l announce my candidacy
for mayor.

1374
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,466
Of course,
you knew that already.

1375
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:41,225
- Got us a suite.

1376
01:14:41,351 --> 01:14:43,394
- You going to tell me
what happened, or what?

1377
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,021
- l've thought
about this day so long,

1378
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,899
worked it out in my head,
and it was nothing.

1379
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,066
No big deal.

1380
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,234
l talked.
He listened.

1381
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,236
He gave me the money.
That's it.

1382
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:54,405
- Well, that's good, right?
You should be happy.

1383
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:55,781
You got your $2,000 back.

1384
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,242
- My money plus 30 years
compounded interest

1385
01:14:58,368 --> 01:15:00,703
adjusted for inflation.

1386
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,039
$1 50,000.

1387
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,920
- What is this?

1388
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,505
You got $1 50,000
in a plastic--

1389
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:11,672
did you steal this?

1390
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:12,840
- He gave it to me,

1391
01:15:12,966 --> 01:15:14,467
and l promise you,
he's not coming after it.

1392
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:15,718
- Why would he
give you $1 50,000?

1393
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,596
- He thinks
he's your father.

1394
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:20,097
- Why does he think
he's my father?

1395
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,391
- He took a test.
l sent him his own DNA,

1396
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:23,935
said it was yours.

1397
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,353
- Well, how'd you
get his DNA?

1398
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,146
- Short, curly pubic hair.

1399
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,565
l don't know.
Ask Dolores.

1400
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:30,942
- Oh, that's--

1401
01:15:31,068 --> 01:15:32,818
that's disgusting.

1402
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:34,654
- She's a friend.

1403
01:15:46,166 --> 01:15:48,125
Top of the menu, right?

1404
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:51,629
What do you say
we throw the map away

1405
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:53,172
and detour down to Vegas?

1406
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:56,133
What stays there
stays there.

1407
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,301
- Yeah, all right.

1408
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:58,511
- What's wrong,

1409
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:02,765
mopey face,
hangdog mopey face?

1410
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,568
- Why would
he just roll over?

1411
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,695
- Well, what else
was he going to do?

1412
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:16,946
l had him boxed in.

1413
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,656
He's running for mayor.

1414
01:16:18,782 --> 01:16:20,241
You think his wife
and spin doctors

1415
01:16:20,367 --> 01:16:22,285
want you
on the campaign poster?

1416
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,706
- Thanks.

1417
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,541
No, it's just,
he was with Mom.

1418
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,334
- ls that right?

1419
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:31,877
- So when exactly
did that start?

1420
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,546
- l don't know.

1421
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:35,089
- Was it before l was born?

1422
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:36,632
- l try not to worry
about things

1423
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:39,176
l can't do anything about.

1424
01:16:40,971 --> 01:16:42,138
- Excuse me?

1425
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,766
- The thing is,
we hit the jackpot, you and me.

1426
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:50,229
You play your cards right,
you never have to punch a clock.

1427
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:53,065
You can start up
something permanent with this.

1428
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:56,027
lt's a nest egg.

1429
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:01,949
- Are you shitting me?

1430
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,117
Are you kidding?

1431
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:04,827
- l know how you feel,
but these last days

1432
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,246
have been the best time for me
in a long time.

1433
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:09,498
- Oh. Oh, jeez.

1434
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,002
- l wanted us to get to know
each other again, and we did.

1435
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,004
- No, you're right.
You're right, you're right.

1436
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:16,172
l admit it.

1437
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:17,715
For some reason,
l was starting to enjoy

1438
01:17:17,841 --> 01:17:19,425
sitting in that stupid car
with you all day.

1439
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:21,636
But that's worth nothing now,
because you're a liar.

1440
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,725
How could you think
that it wouldn't matter to me

1441
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:30,728
to know who my father is?

1442
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:40,988
Hello?

1443
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,997
Hey.

1444
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:52,333
Give me a straight answer.

1445
01:18:02,135 --> 01:18:04,595
You're not even dying,
are you?

1446
01:18:04,721 --> 01:18:08,265
- The X-ray is from
a friend of mine at the zoo.

1447
01:18:08,392 --> 01:18:10,726
lt's the skull bone
of a gorilla.

1448
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,023
- All right, well,
maybe you're not my father,

1449
01:18:16,149 --> 01:18:18,317
but ever morning, l wake up,
l look in the mirror,

1450
01:18:18,443 --> 01:18:19,485
and l feel sick to my stomach

1451
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:22,530
because l think l'm turning out
to be just like you.

1452
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:33,958
- Stick a knife in my heart.

1453
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:35,668
What's wrong?

1454
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:38,421
Where you going
with the money?

1455
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,134
What are you doing?

1456
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:46,929
[door shuts]

1457
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:06,467
- So give me a number.

1458
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:09,929
How much more
is this going to cost me?

1459
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,599
- l don't want your money.

1460
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,393
- Why have you come?

1461
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,771
- l wanted
to get a look at you.

1462
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,440
- l wanted
to get a look at you too.

1463
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:26,278
You're not
what l expected.

1464
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,780
But then again,

1465
01:20:27,906 --> 01:20:30,991
l bet Nat painted me
as the bad guy too, didn't he?

1466
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:34,078
- Something like that.

1467
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:37,873
- Look,

1468
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,417
l already have a son.

1469
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:43,796
But l might be willing to make
an arrangement with you.

1470
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,131
Not out in the open, of course.

1471
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,259
But l could get you
a job in sales.

1472
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,636
We're opening
a new dealership in Reno.

1473
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:55,641
- So you're my father.

1474
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:59,270
- l suppose we ought to get
a legitimate blood test.

1475
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:01,438
l got to assume
Nat's hustling me.

1476
01:21:01,565 --> 01:21:02,773
- Why'd you pay him?

1477
01:21:02,899 --> 01:21:04,984
- Guilt.

1478
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,360
Pity.

1479
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:09,363
l wanted him to feel
like he'd pulled off

1480
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:11,866
something big
for once in his life.

1481
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:14,869
You know,
a big score.

1482
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:16,078
[chuckles]

1483
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:22,835
Look. . .

1484
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:25,337
after the election,
you get in touch with me.

1485
01:21:25,463 --> 01:21:27,339
l really have
to be getting back.

1486
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:31,302
- Okay, can l ask you
a question?

1487
01:21:32,762 --> 01:21:33,846
Did you love her?

1488
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:36,807
- You know
what women are like.

1489
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:38,642
You say something
in the heat of the moment.

1490
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:39,977
Do you mean it?

1491
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:41,270
They think it's forever.

1492
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,148
- Honey?

1493
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:47,109
You're keeping some
very important people waiting.

1494
01:21:49,821 --> 01:21:52,072
- Can you see your way out?

1495
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:53,949
- Saw my way in.

1496
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,118
- [laughs]

1497
01:22:00,665 --> 01:22:03,834
- Seriously, l will turn
the mic over to Tom.

1498
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,671
Tom, what do you have to say
about Bert Kruger?

1499
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:10,341
- He's a man of honor
and integrity,

1500
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,259
despite being
a used car salesman.

1501
01:22:12,385 --> 01:22:14,345
[laughter]

1502
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:15,679
lt would be
my honor to support him

1503
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,348
as the next mayor
of this city,

1504
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:19,725
especially if l get the discount
on that new Caddy.

1505
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,352
- You got it, Tom.

1506
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:23,729
- Just kidding, Bert.

1507
01:22:23,855 --> 01:22:25,022
- Hi, everybody.

1508
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:26,357
l'll be real quick.

1509
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,442
l just wanted
to say a few words

1510
01:22:28,568 --> 01:22:30,945
about the man l've just
discovered is my father,

1511
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,780
Mr. Kruger.

1512
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:35,532
Dad. . .

1513
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:38,869
l just wanted to say how great
it is to finally meet you

1514
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:41,997
and to see what l've been
missing all this time.

1515
01:22:42,123 --> 01:22:43,165
l was in jail.

1516
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:49,046
And about that $1 50,000
that you paid to get rid of me,

1517
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,255
l don't want it.

1518
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:51,674
l hate bribes.

1519
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:58,722
- Hold it!

1520
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,850
- Mr. Kruger, sir,
you've just been accused

1521
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,394
of paying hush money
to an ex-con

1522
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:04,561
who claims to be your son.

1523
01:23:04,688 --> 01:23:05,896
Do you have any comments, sir?

1524
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:09,066
- Yes, this is dirty tricks
by Terrance Bissen, my opponent.

1525
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,567
- ls that a denial, sir?

1526
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,319
- lt's a categorical denial.

1527
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:15,906
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.

1528
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:38,220
- Did you give him the money?

1529
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,559
How could you do that?

1530
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,727
What have you done?

1531
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:47,479
You gave back $1 50,000.

1532
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:50,607
Am l right?

1533
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,068
Did you give him the money?

1534
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:54,236
Yes or no?

1535
01:23:56,239 --> 01:23:57,614
- Come on.

1536
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,617
You raised me
better than that.

1537
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,417
- Vegas,
here we come.

1538
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:29,772
- Hey, Nat?

1539
01:24:29,898 --> 01:24:31,982
How about
we head down to L.A. after?

1540
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:34,109
l want you
to meet Maggie.

1541
01:24:37,447 --> 01:24:47,706
Nat?

1542
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:06,934
Hi.

1543
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,354
l'm in a hospital
in Albuquerque.

1544
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,022
lt's Nat.

1545
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:15,150
And it turns out,

1546
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:20,489
this is the first time in his
life he's telling the truth.

1547
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,449
And. . .

1548
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:24,952
he's dying.

1549
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:35,295
He really is dying.

1550
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:38,757
So. . .

1551
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,759
That's. . .

1552
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:44,054
what l wanted to tell you.

1553
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:45,264
Bye.

1554
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:47,015
[phone beeps]

1555
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,699
[crying]

1556
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:08,370
[phone ringing]

1557
01:26:12,375 --> 01:26:15,377
Hello?

1558
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,715
Hi.

1559
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:38,525
- Could l get another tapioca,
please?

1560
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:39,902
- You've got a sweet tooth.

1561
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:42,029
- l do.

1562
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:55,125
Closer.

1563
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,878
Let me feel your face.

1564
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,058
- l'm sorry.

1565
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:14,436
- We did good, though.

1566
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:17,147
We got copasetic.

1567
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:19,233
We're not done yet.

1568
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:37,167
Come here.

1569
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:40,212
Get me out of here.

1570
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,012
- Hi.

1571
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,986
- Thanks for coming.

1572
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,738
- Well, nobody ever
flew me first class before.

1573
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:07,906
- [laughs]

1574
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,366
l do what l can.

1575
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:20,043
- Your mustache.

1576
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:22,587
- You want me
to grow it back or what?

1577
01:29:08,968 --> 01:29:13,055
- l won this place
in a card game a long time ago.

1578
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,057
l figured,
one day, you'd come here

1579
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:19,061
and bring the girl of your
dreams, like l did.

1580
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:23,482
Oh.

1581
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,817
Somebody's been here.

1582
01:29:31,282 --> 01:29:34,368
l don't remember the place
being such a dump.

1583
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:51,551
We were a family once.

1584
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:12,489
You wanted a boat?

1585
01:30:14,617 --> 01:30:15,909
- Thank you.

1586
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:19,996
- Just so you know,

1587
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,833
if l could do it again,

1588
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:26,962
l'd have been more like a dad,

1589
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:30,298
tossed a ball, pitched a tent,

1590
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:31,967
taught you to drive.

1591
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:35,262
- You did teach me to drive.

1592
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:36,471
- Come on.
Uncle Al--

1593
01:30:36,597 --> 01:30:38,432
- No, you did.
You did.

1594
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:45,188
ln the parking lot behind
St. Paul's Church when l was 1 1 .

1595
01:30:45,314 --> 01:30:48,024
- You're right.

1596
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:50,735
How could l do
a thing like that?

1597
01:30:58,661 --> 01:30:59,703
- Come on.

1598
01:30:59,829 --> 01:31:01,246
There's something
we got to do.

1599
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:44,664
Well, l spent my whole life

1600
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,708
wanting a different kind
of a father,

1601
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:54,007
one who would look after me
instead of me looking after him.

1602
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,676
And instead,

1603
01:31:56,802 --> 01:32:02,599
l got this infantile,
irresponsible,

1604
01:32:02,725 --> 01:32:11,233
uncivilized, cheap,
jive-talking bullshit artist.

1605
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:15,320
And now that
l'm rid of you,

1606
01:32:15,446 --> 01:32:17,697
here. . .

1607
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:28,208

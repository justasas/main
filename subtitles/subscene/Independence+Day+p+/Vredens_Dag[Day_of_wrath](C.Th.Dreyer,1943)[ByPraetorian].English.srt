1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,978
DAY OF WRATH

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,588
Day of Wrath, dreadful night,

3
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:28,552
Heaven and earth in ashes burning,

4
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,263
And the sun beset by dead of night.

5
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:35,795
That Day of Wrath, that sulfurous day

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,932
When flaming heavens together roll,

7
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:42,831
And earth's beautiful castle shall pass away.

8
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,145
Day of Wrath, when we shall

9
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,514
Awake from clay to judgment

10
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,816
And be brought to our enchanted hour.

11
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,620
Day of Wrath, the mighty trumpet's tone

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,950
Calls forth the living and the dead

13
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,229
And shall rend each tomb's sepulchral stone.

14
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,227
Day of Wrath, by God unleashed,

15
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,501
Behold Satan's ghastly abacus

16
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,533
Shown before the Judge's gaze.

17
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,738
The Day of Wrath, that judgment day,

18
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,080
Then shall be heard with universal dread

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,947
The sins revealed as they are read.

20
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,115
Day of Wrath, O, see them stand

21
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,918
Before His Throne, small and grim,

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,758
Clad in shame and rancid sin.

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,627
Day of Wrath, for pity take

24
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,792
My sins away from Satan's grasp

25
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,299
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

26
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,630
And whereas the said Herlof's Marte

27
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:51,174
is denounced as a witch

28
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:54,073
by three respected and worthy citizens,

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,010
we rule that she be seized

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,550
and brought before the Court.

31
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,172
If only it helps!

32
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:24,302
It is sure to.
They're herbs from under the gallows!

33
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,873
It's strange they have so much power.

34
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,675
There is power in Evil!

35
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,686
Who are they hunting now?

36
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,805
<i>She'll be put on the stake,

37
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,176
<i>She'll be put on the stake

38
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,409
<i>And shall burn. And burn

39
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,588
<i>With smoldering flesh

40
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,279
<i>She'll be put on the stake,

41
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,424
<i>She'll be put on the stake

42
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,992
<i>And shall burn. And burn

43
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,753
<i>With smoldering flesh

44
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,480
<i>Open up. Open up, Herlof's Marte

45
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,050
Put these away.

46
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,069
Absalon, Martin should be here soon.

47
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,866
The ship has just come in.

48
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,902
I'll be there right away.

49
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,752
Have you the key to the loft?

50
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,419
May I have it?

51
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,360
In this house

52
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,500
I carry the keys.

53
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,203
I am Absalon's wife.

54
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,070
But I am his mother.

55
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,946
It is not easy for an old dog
to learn new tricks.

56
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,483
Nor is it easy for a young wife

57
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,955
to come into an old household.

58
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,732
You are too hard on her.

59
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,965
I want her to be a good wife to you.

60
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,301
She is.

61
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,406
When your first wife was alive...

62
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:25,175
She is not alive anymore.

63
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,087
No, but her son is alive.

64
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,984
And now he's coming home...

65
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,986
home to a new mother

66
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,528
many years younger than he.

67
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,259
What does it matter?

68
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,094
Matter?

69
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,238
I think it is... scandalous.

70
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,437
I'm going out to meet Martin.

71
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,157
Is Master Absalon at home?

72
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,487
No, he has gone to meet his son.

73
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,628
I am his son.

74
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,900
Are you his son?

75
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,729
Are you his wife?

76
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,848
It seems I've seen your face before.

77
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,025
Where would that have been?

78
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,164
Perhaps in my thoughts.

79
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,892
I have thought about you
many, many times...

80
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:29,268
wondering what you would say
to so young a mother.

81
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,541
I promise to be a good son to you!

82
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,613
Yes...you are my son now.

83
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,775
And you, my mother.

84
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,249
My grown son.

85
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,797
What is keeping father?

86
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,832
Here comes father now.

87
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,974
Anne, shall we surprise him?
I'll hide.

88
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,144
Didn't Martin come with you?

89
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,942
Hasn't he come yet?

90
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,017
He'll be here soon.

91
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,983
Yes, he probably will.

92
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:36,169
What's this?
It's Martin's songbook.

93
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,215
Here is the song of
the Maiden and the Apple Tree.

94
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,041
A Maiden

95
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,210
sat in an apple tree high.
A lad chanced to pass by.

96
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,753
She stretched, the bough it bent.

97
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,051
Within his arms she landed.

98
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:14,870
This is so nice. Don't you want
to give your mother a kiss?

99
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,650
Shall we go to my study?

100
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:25,983
Yes, father.

101
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,699
You're bleeding!

102
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,733
It's nothing.

103
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:23,482
You must help me, hide me!

104
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,913
They will burn me if they catch me!

105
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,188
Have they denounced you as a witch?

106
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,025
I helped your mother.

107
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,527
She too was denounced as a witch.

108
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,540
My mother?... It's not true.

109
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,466
It is true! She was set free

110
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,771
only because you were her daughter.

111
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,444
You cannot send me out to my death...

112
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,581
<i>Get firewood for the oven.

113
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,351
<i>And Bente, clean the fish.

114
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:22,996
Where are you going?

115
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,231
Nowhere.

116
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,612
Is that cupboard to remain open?

117
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,937
Grandmother. Grandmother.

118
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,751
Why are you so quiet, Anne?

119
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,733
We are looking for Herlof's Marte.

120
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,373
Here?

121
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,010
In the rectory?

122
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,710
Some children saw her come in here.

123
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,717
But that is impossible... then we must...

124
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,980
Have you seen Herlof's Marte?

125
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,264
If she is here, she must have sneaked in...
Yes, look for her.

126
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,520
Bloodstains...Over here.

127
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,693
Is there another entrance to the loft?

128
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,897
Yes, by the other staircase.

129
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,460
Tell Hans and Henrik to go up that way.

130
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,003
The Lord have mercy upon us!

131
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:26,547
And this should have been a day of joy!

132
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,628
I order that the Notary of the Chapter

133
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,100
the Reverend Absalon Pederssøn

134
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,002
take the said Herlof's Marte
to confession.

135
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,371
He shall diligently exhort her
to confess the full truth

136
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:50,344
that she may not die without
penance, but her soul be saved.

137
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:07,858
Help me, Absalon.
Save me from the stake.

138
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,128
Only God can help you.

139
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,593
You can. If you want.

140
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:26,778
I ask only that you do for me
what you did for Anne's mother.

141
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,371
What do you mean?

142
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,409
You spared her.

143
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,116
Do not say more than you can answer for.

144
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,886
I know what I say.

145
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:39,121
You knew she was a witch,
but you kept silent...

146
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:40,821
You lie!

147
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,722
You kept silent for Anne's sake.

148
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,405
Come here.

149
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,219
Kneel.

150
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,485
I'm begging for my life.

151
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:23,066
You shall not beg for your life.
You should pray for your soul.

152
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,908
Confess the truth.

153
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,145
What shall I confess?

154
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,243
That you are a witch.

155
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:45,715
A witch? I knew of one...

156
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,288
She was Anne's mother,
and you set her free.

157
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,496
Be quiet.

158
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:20,487
I am so terribly afraid... to die.

159
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:23,825
Come with me.

160
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:46,112
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning.

161
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:51,955
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning

162
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,258
You're here.

163
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,721
I came to listen to the singing.

164
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:02,797
<i>Day of Wrath that...

165
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,868
<i>Day of Wrath...

166
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,138
Why are they learning that?

167
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,069
To sing when Herlof's Marte is burned.

168
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,071
I hear her screams all the time.

169
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,041
Come, let's go.

170
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:26,016
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders

171
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:32,591
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends.

172
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,257
The old one's giving in.

173
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,538
Will you confess?

174
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,665
Yes.

175
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,076
Finally.

176
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,273
Release her.

177
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:11,334
Thereafter she consented
to a confession.

178
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:37,457
Tell us how you entered
the service of the Evil One?

179
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,457
Answer!

180
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:45,970
So you will not confess...

181
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:48,932
She hasn't had enough.

182
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,268
I have.

183
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,875
Answer me then.

184
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,978
Where did you first meet the Devil?

185
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:58,281
Under the gallows?

186
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:01,109
You had to trample on the cross?

187
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,811
He forbade you
to receive the Sacrament?

188
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,556
You had to abjure God and Christ

189
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,723
and sell your soul
to the Devil for eternity.

190
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,729
Have you anything more to confess?

191
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:18,660
No.

192
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:26,976
A fine confession!

193
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,182
She is difficult.

194
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,556
Ask her if she knows of others.

195
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,707
We haven't finished yet.
Do you know any other witches?

196
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,009
No.

197
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,703
Have you known any?

198
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,940
Is there anyone you can denounce?

199
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,742
She is dead now.

200
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:08,885
Who was she?

201
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:18,555
Who she was...who she was?

202
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,768
Well, who was she?
Give me her name.

203
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,537
I do not remember.

204
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,769
But I'll remember you!

205
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:32,802
How's that?

206
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,642
Send me to my death...

207
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,474
and yours will follow!

208
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,711
Your threats don't move me.

209
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,118
You'd better tell me her name.

210
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,067
I'll say no more.

211
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,499
I have said enough.

212
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,747
You better loosen your tongue...

213
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:19,220
That's enough.
I will speak to her myself.

214
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,409
Save me from the stake!

215
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,847
I know...you will stand by me.

216
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,558
I beseech Thee, O Lord,

217
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,853
that this woman may repent

218
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,158
and that she may turn to Thee

219
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,500
and seek her salvation.

220
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:12,009
Take courage...be strong.

221
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,244
Take her away.

222
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,551
Come with me.

223
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,364
She named no one?

224
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,367
Perhaps, put to the question again.

225
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:18,098
All will be made known
in God's own good time!

226
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:23,509
Herlof's Marte was subjected
to painful interrogation

227
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:28,084
after which she made
a full voluntary confession

228
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,221
in the presence of
the assembled clergy.

229
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,654
June 14, 1 623
Absalon Pederssøn - Jørgen Ravn

230
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,814
Gathering firewood already?

231
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,579
No, wood for the stake.

232
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:42,916
I have come to prepare you...
for death.

233
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,920
So you have failed me.

234
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:49,025
No, I have not failed you.

235
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,361
I have thought of you
these many days.

236
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,726
How I could secure for you...
Life Eternal.

237
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,462
Stop all your prattle.

238
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,734
I fear neither Heaven nor Hell.
I am only afraid to die.

239
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:11,338
I spared Anne.

240
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,575
And you fail me.

241
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,844
No, Marte.

242
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,212
But it is not too late.

243
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,350
Anne shall suffer as I suffer.

244
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,794
If I burn at the stake, so shall Anne.

245
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,073
No, no...

246
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:41,908
If they burn me...
If they burn me...

247
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,475
I don't want to be burned.
I don't want to.

248
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,626
I don't want to.

249
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,563
Go.

250
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,875
Go! Get out!

251
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,167
<i>She'll be put on the stake,

252
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,464
<i>She'll be put on the stake

253
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,539
<i>And shall burn. And burn

254
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,972
<i>With smoldering flesh

255
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,414
<i>She'll be put on the stake,

256
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,709
<i>She'll be put on the stake

257
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,250
<i>And shall burn. And burn

258
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,446
<i>With smoldering flesh.

259
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:29,681
Are you leaving?

260
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,649
I cannot stand this.

261
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:33,641
Stay here with me.

262
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,456
I want to speak to Absalon!

263
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,059
What for?

264
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,289
I want to speak to Absalon!

265
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:48,362
Do you want to denounce someone?

266
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,329
I want to speak to Absalon.

267
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,717
The condemned would like
to speak to you.

268
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,769
Free me from the stake.
Otherwise...

269
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,076
Have no fear.
The Lord is merciful.

270
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:44,050
He will open your eyes
and turn your soul from sin.

271
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,423
I will denounce Anne,
do you hear me!

272
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,919
You'll suffer for this!

273
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:10,613
The Devil will get you,
you hypocrite, you liar!

274
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:15,149
You liar. You liar. You liar.

275
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:25,126
<i>Day of Wrath. Day of Mourning

276
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:30,895
<i>See fulfilled the prophet's warning

277
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:37,064
<i>Heaven and earth in ashes burning

278
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,206
<i>Oh what fear man's soul renders

279
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:51,653
<i>When from Heaven the Judge descends

280
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:58,453
<i>On whose sentence all depends

281
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:03,398
<i>Wondrous sounds the trumpet sings

282
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,135
On this beauteous day,
Herlof's Marte was successfully

283
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,901
burned at the stake.
Glory be to God.

284
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:41,299
<i>Lord, I beseech Thee with all my heart,

285
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,700
<i>help me in my hour of need!

286
00:35:45,042 --> 00:35:51,538
<i>I have been a faithful servant,
and have kept Thy commandments.

287
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:55,185
<i>Yet now my innermost soul
is shaken by gnawing doubt.

288
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,184
<i>O Lord,
let thy light shine upon me...

289
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:06,558
<i>that I may find my way out
of this terrible darkness.

290
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:25,642
Do you want something?

291
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:27,918
Yes.

292
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,425
Something is tormenting you.

293
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:47,793
What is it? Tell your mother.

294
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:55,377
Mother, I have sinned.

295
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,616
Sinned against God.

296
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,878
I have lied to Him.

297
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:12,924
How? Tell me.
I'm your mother, aren't l?

298
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,462
Yes.

299
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:20,963
But this is a fight I must fight alone.

300
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:55,568
You've changed since
Herlof's Marte was arrested.

301
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,242
And now she has burned at the
stake. You've become so strange.

302
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,390
Did she...

303
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,583
denounce another?

304
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,528
And you're keeping it secret?

305
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,893
She denounced no living person.

306
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:29,630
No living person?
No one living.

307
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,581
Have you ever looked into
Anne's eyes?

308
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:49,883
Have you seen how they burn?

309
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,893
I am thinking of her mother.

310
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:59,836
Her eyes burned in the same way.

311
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,602
Why are you saying this?

312
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,801
The day may come when you must
choose between...

313
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,308
Between what?

314
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,413
Between God and Anne.

315
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,975
You say that because you hate Anne.

316
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:22,421
No, out of love to you!

317
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:08,432
Goodnight, Grandmother.

318
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,339
Goodnight, Martin.

319
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:19,116
Goodnight.

320
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,105
Goodnight, father.

321
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,371
Goodnight, my son.

322
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:09,056
Anne, there is something
we must discuss.

323
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,759
It concerns your mother.

324
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:14,827
My mother?

325
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,954
Is it that... that mother?

326
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,146
You know?

327
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,918
Yes...But is it true?

328
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:38,661
She confessed it.

329
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,863
What did she confess?

330
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,667
That she had the power of invocation.

331
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,541
She could call up
the Living and the Dead.

332
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,335
And they had to come.

333
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,905
If she wished someone dead,

334
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,445
he died.

335
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,365
Is it true you spared her
to marry me?

336
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,556
Do you blame me for that?

337
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,970
For being kind to mother? No.

338
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,772
But?

339
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,665
Were you also kind to me?

340
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,407
Have I not been a kind husband?

341
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:32,082
Yes, you have.
Did you ever ask me if I loved you?

342
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:36,551
You were so young,
just a child.

343
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,378
But did I love you?

344
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,081
It is strange...

345
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,923
I never thought of that.

346
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:47,157
No, I suppose you haven't.

347
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:13,817
Absalon, hold me.
Hold me and make me happy.

348
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:29,703
I must look into myself.
I have much to speak to God about.

349
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,279
Goodnight, Anne.

350
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,883
Look into my eyes.

351
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:49,823
Your wonderful eyes.

352
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,659
So childlike.

353
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,891
Pure and clear...

354
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,474
Goodnight.

355
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,578
How was it with my mother?

356
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:22,956
She could call
the Living and the Dead.

357
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:26,728
And they had to come.
Was that it?

358
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:28,955
Why do you ask?

359
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:33,599
I think it strange that...
with the power mother had...

360
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:40,534
A human being can have such power...

361
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,870
I can do it. I can do it.

362
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,628
Anne, you're crying.

363
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,628
I see you through my tears.

364
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,198
Tears that I wipe away.

365
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,880
No one has eyes like yours.

366
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,119
What are they like?

367
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,554
Childlike?

368
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,220
Pure and clear?

369
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,487
No, deep and mysterious.

370
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,326
But in their depths I see

371
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,534
a trembling, quivering flame

372
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,400
which you have kindled.

373
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:58,973
Let's go to the birches.

374
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,985
How happy I am!

375
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:45,225
Just to say "l love you".

376
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,096
And to know...

377
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,793
That you and l...

378
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:57,066
You were always in my thoughts.

379
00:47:57,774 --> 00:47:59,639
And you in my dreams.

380
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,536
Here's the spring.

381
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,142
Come here.

382
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,958
More?

383
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,532
Water? No.

384
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,031
Of what then?

385
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,398
Drink.

386
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,619
Hear how they whisper.

387
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:58,292
It's the grass humming.

388
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,562
Humming what?

389
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,031
A song about the two of us.

390
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:05,931
The song of your love.

391
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,926
And of yours.

392
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:17,170
Hold me tight. Make me happy.

393
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:27,153
...so that we may wander decently

394
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:32,158
and securely in the sight of God.

395
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:38,767
Through this Your most Holy Name. Amen.

396
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,638
May I read a little
from the Song of Songs?

397
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,571
Yes, please do.

398
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:54,742
I am the rose of Sharon,
and the lily of the valleys.

399
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:58,409
As the lily among thorns,
so is my love among the daughters.

400
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:03,219
As the apple tree among the trees
of the wood, so is my beloved.

401
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:05,624
I sat down under his shadow.

402
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,724
We have heard enough.

403
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,024
Will you stop it!

404
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,574
Wretched woman.

405
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,476
Grandmother?

406
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,985
I meant it.

407
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:45,761
Martin, what have we done to you?

408
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,687
You seem so far apart from us now.

409
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,528
Both from me and your father.

410
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,532
Promise me to think of your father

411
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,470
and do not cause him grief.

412
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:26,996
Martin, would you help me?

413
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,728
Yes, of course.

414
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,789
Grandmother does not like you.

415
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,752
What does it matter -
if you like me?

416
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,162
If you love me.

417
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,228
Anne, how will this all end?

418
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:11,113
Kiss me.

419
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,744
Then I'll kiss you.

420
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:53,947
There you are.

421
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:08,863
Shut the door.

422
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:17,308
It's the first time I hear Anne laugh.

423
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,850
How she's changed.

424
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,652
Even her voice is different.

425
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:32,318
Yes... she is changed.

426
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,489
When I see those two together

427
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:41,564
I feel for the first time how old I am...
And how young she is.

428
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,241
It is good Martin came home.

429
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,144
I will join them
and be young with the young.

430
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,332
It was nice to hear you laugh.

431
00:56:20,076 --> 00:56:22,840
We were just going.

432
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,743
Where to?

433
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,040
To the river.

434
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:31,347
I wanted to ask you to read
through my sermon.

435
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:32,748
With pleasure, father.

436
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,891
Oh, can't it wait,
I had so looked forward to this.

437
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:40,830
I would be the last
to deprive you of any pleasure.

438
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:42,188
Go now.

439
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,200
It's the chaplain.

440
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,745
A message from Master Laurentius.

441
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:31,277
He is dying!

442
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:37,278
He asks you to come and prepare him.

443
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,283
I've brought the Holy Vessels.

444
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:39,921
I'm going.

445
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,515
How alive your hands are.

446
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:17,985
Your fingers.

447
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,727
Your wrist.

448
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:30,562
I can feel your pulse beating.

449
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,439
Beating for you.

450
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,242
The sun is coloring your cheeks.

451
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,076
Not the sun, happiness.

452
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,447
Happiness?
How long will it last?

453
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,123
Forever!

454
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:51,653
Anne, where will we end up?

455
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,056
Wherever the stream leads us!

456
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,260
One day.

457
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,991
Don't think about it.
So much can happen.

458
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,131
I see my father before me all the time.

459
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,540
I see only you.

460
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:21,307
Here I lie.

461
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:25,017
Soft and snug as in a mother's arms.

462
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:32,790
Herlof's Marte did not forget me.

463
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,720
What do you mean?

464
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:38,056
She promised me death.

465
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,730
She deserved her punishment.

466
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,430
I suppose so.

467
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,091
Anne, let me go away.

468
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:05,626
Go away?

469
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,388
Yes, let's separate for a bit.

470
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:09,929
Separate?

471
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:14,360
Separate.

472
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,868
How could we two separate?

473
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:24,474
Think of all we've given to each other.

474
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:27,013
Look at that tree.

475
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:29,611
Yes, it bows in sorrow.

476
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:31,548
No, in longing.

477
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,379
It grieves over us.

478
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,486
It yearns after its own
reflection in the water.

479
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:42,531
As those two can never
be torn asunder.

480
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,091
Nor can we ever separate.

481
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:12,984
My body...is of this Earth.

482
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,362
And to the Earth I again submit it.

483
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,760
My soul...I have from God.

484
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,101
And unto God I surrender it.

485
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:31,678
Give me your hands.

486
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:34,710
Here, you have them.

487
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,877
That I may hold them

488
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,416
till mine grow cold.

489
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:45,157
It will not be long before I follow you.

490
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:46,726
You seek to comfort me.

491
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:51,764
I often feel Death approaching.

492
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:56,733
But I go to meet it with courage.

493
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,236
And hope!

494
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:06,076
"Whosoever believeth shall live,
though he die."

495
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:11,086
If we could die... together, here.

496
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:18,859
Die? Die?

497
01:03:19,662 --> 01:03:20,754
Why?

498
01:03:21,063 --> 01:03:22,690
To atone for our sin.

499
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,397
Sin? Is it a sin to love?

500
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:32,565
Don't speak,
don't think anything except...

501
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:35,744
That we two belong together!

502
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:42,880
"As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood,

503
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,916
"so is my beloved..."

504
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:48,850
"l sat down under his shadow..."

505
01:03:56,065 --> 01:03:57,623
What weather!

506
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,958
We will hear of some misfortune
after such a storm.

507
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,201
Does one hear of anything else
these days?

508
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,037
Did you remember Absalon's beer?

509
01:04:13,749 --> 01:04:14,909
No, I forgot.

510
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:50,709
Accept this body of Jesus
who gave you life

511
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,648
for you and your sins,

512
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:56,916
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

513
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:06,831
Accept this cup poured for you
as the covenant in his blood,

514
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:12,466
to strengthen you in faith
for all eternity.

515
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:28,949
No, you can't look.

516
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:30,957
Oh, let me.

517
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,352
Can you make it out?

518
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,661
A pear tree.

519
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:39,827
A pear tree!
Anyone can see it is an apple tree!

520
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,635
And here is an apple blossom.

521
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:43,997
Only one?

522
01:05:44,206 --> 01:05:47,107
Yes, my apple tree has only
one blossom.

523
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,693
I hope Absalon won't come
across the bog.

524
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:08,523
If I knew the way he was coming,
I'd meet him.

525
01:06:10,266 --> 01:06:12,564
If you go through the bog,
he may go around it.

526
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,668
And if you go round it,
he may walk through it.

527
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,742
You must understand. Anne
wants you to stay at home.

528
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:25,914
But Anne is right.
It is no use wandering about in the dark.

529
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,608
It is better to wait here for father.

530
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:34,019
Then we'll <i>all wait.

531
01:06:40,262 --> 01:06:41,229
You too?

532
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,529
Then I will go to bed.

533
01:06:53,609 --> 01:06:56,043
God have mercy on those at sea!

534
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,976
And on those not at sea!

535
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:01,716
You are thinking of Absalon?

536
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,343
Yes. And of you!

537
01:07:33,916 --> 01:07:39,354
There is nothing so quiet as
a heart that has ceased to beat.

538
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,842
You should get yourself a wife.

539
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,278
There's no hurry.

540
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:15,218
There is no one in the world whom
I love as much as your father.

541
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:20,960
In him God gave me the son
I had longed for.

542
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:23,996
And I shall defend him until
the day I lie in my grave.

543
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:34,674
Grandmother, why don't you like Anne?

544
01:08:36,078 --> 01:08:39,047
I have never done her any harm
that I know of.

545
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:40,545
But you don't like her?

546
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:50,223
No, I do not like her.

547
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,856
I hate her.

548
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,526
Father's wife.

549
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:57,227
The only grief your father ever
caused me

550
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,401
was bringing her into this house.

551
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:01,967
How can you talk like that?

552
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,864
Because it is the truth.

553
01:09:06,675 --> 01:09:08,540
A small, innocent woman.

554
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:10,772
Innocent?

555
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,748
I've had my say.

556
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,162
I shall go to bed.

557
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,097
Goodnight, Martin.

558
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:42,503
May the Lord have you in His keeping!

559
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:27,575
My Anne.

560
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:29,778
Yes, yours.

561
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:33,315
Yes... But my father's wife!

562
01:11:34,023 --> 01:11:37,117
Wife, yes - I never loved him.

563
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:39,817
Nor he me.

564
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:43,287
Do you never think of him?

565
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:49,267
I often think, if he were dead...

566
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:51,204
Do you wish him dead?

567
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:55,309
I think only if he were dead.

568
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,708
Are you ill, Master Absalon?

569
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:08,086
I felt as if Death had just brushed by me.

570
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:11,020
Death?

571
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:13,685
Yes, let's just go.

572
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:19,262
We will have a small house by the sea.

573
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,000
Every morning I shall wake...

574
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:26,300
my head on your shoulder.

575
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,540
With a kiss I'll wake you.

576
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,710
Then we hear from his cradle

577
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,941
a little Martin crying.

578
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,547
I pick him up.

579
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:44,449
And as I found life at your breast

580
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:47,559
he'll find life at mine.

581
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,025
The tenderness you gave to me

582
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,292
I give back to him.

583
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:57,500
While I hum for him

584
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,437
a song about us two.

585
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,113
Isn't it lovely to think about?

586
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,512
Yes. It is only a dream.

587
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:13,618
What does it matter?

588
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,553
So long as it is a beautiful dream?

589
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,707
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

590
01:13:42,985 --> 01:13:45,715
No, we waited up for you,
Martin and l.

591
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,219
Good evening, Father.

592
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:51,757
Good evening, Martin.

593
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,436
You were away a long time.

594
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,566
How is Master Laurentius?

595
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:09,008
God gave him a mild death.

596
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:19,243
Would you like some beer?
It's been near the fire.

597
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:25,594
Thank you for waiting up,
both of you.

598
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:39,101
Father, you are tired. You should rest.

599
01:14:39,942 --> 01:14:41,341
I am tired.

600
01:14:42,077 --> 01:14:44,136
But I don't think I can rest.

601
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,510
I come from a man

602
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:51,283
who died in piety.

603
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:55,420
But otherwise,

604
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:58,019
if I think of all the sighs

605
01:14:58,227 --> 01:15:00,661
from other deathbeds I have sat by,

606
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:06,133
I see only sin...and sin... and sin.

607
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,803
The pleasure of the moment.

608
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,866
The secret sin.

609
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,004
Oh, Lord...

610
01:15:14,209 --> 01:15:17,474
What lives men lead.

611
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,576
You speak so strangely.

612
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:25,917
That is because I felt
a strange uneasiness.

613
01:15:27,389 --> 01:15:29,857
Out there, earlier.

614
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,788
I felt as if Death held me by the hand.

615
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:35,729
I heard nothing.

616
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,863
I saw nothing.

617
01:15:39,902 --> 01:15:42,803
But in my innermost soul I felt

618
01:15:43,105 --> 01:15:46,268
my death had been decided.

619
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,373
You are tired.
You are ill.

620
01:15:49,912 --> 01:15:54,076
I am not ill.
But I am tired.

621
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,908
Go to bed now.

622
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,786
Goodnight, my son. Sleep well.

623
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,962
I wish I could ease your heavy thoughts.

624
01:16:13,835 --> 01:16:16,201
You have yours to think about.

625
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,552
You should not think so much of death.

626
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:45,593
You are right, Anne,
but I cannot get away from the thought.

627
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,697
My death has been decided!

628
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,900
Who would want you dead?

629
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:56,270
Who would?

630
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:02,513
Anne, have you never wished me dead?

631
01:17:03,018 --> 01:17:05,077
Why should l?

632
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:07,752
Because

633
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,524
I did you a great wrong.

634
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:16,795
I never asked you if you wished
to be mine...I took you.

635
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:20,691
I took your youth.

636
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:26,665
That is a wrong for which
I can never make amends.

637
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,941
Yes, it is true.

638
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,409
You took my youth.

639
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,744
My joy.

640
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,409
I burned for someone to love.

641
01:17:44,359 --> 01:17:45,758
I dreamed

642
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,555
of a little child to hold in my arms.

643
01:17:53,468 --> 01:17:55,698
Not even that did you give me.

644
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:02,071
You asked if I ever wished you were dead.

645
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,571
I have wished it hundreds of times.

646
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,645
I wished it when you were with me.

647
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:15,320
I wished it when you left me.

648
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:23,196
But never did I wish it so hard
as since Martin and l...

649
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:24,865
Martin? And you.

650
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,535
Yes. Martin and l.

651
01:18:28,503 --> 01:18:29,800
Now you know.

652
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:34,504
Therefore, I now wish you dead.

653
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:36,607
<i>Dead!

654
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:57,427
Father. Father.

655
01:18:58,567 --> 01:18:59,693
What is it?

656
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,970
Shall I keep vigil now?

657
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:16,142
No. Martin will keep vigil tonight.

658
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:25,676
Why are you so quiet?

659
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,115
Say something.

660
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,415
Did he know?

661
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,257
What do you mean?

662
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,854
Did he know that you and l...

663
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,164
You told him.

664
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,860
He knew.
That's why he called out to me.

665
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:46,297
I am cold! Keep me warm!

666
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,709
I still hear his voice.

667
01:20:49,544 --> 01:20:52,104
Father. Father.

668
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:01,519
Are you weeping for him?

669
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:03,613
Or me?

670
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,387
For myself.

671
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,288
Why?

672
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:12,824
I wish I were dead.

673
01:21:14,502 --> 01:21:17,335
Everything, everything is over now.

674
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:21,232
No, Martin. It's only the beginning.

675
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:23,041
Not for me.

676
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:24,371
For us.

677
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,438
Why should he die?

678
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:31,885
I believe he died for our sake.

679
01:21:35,123 --> 01:21:38,456
I am afraid for you.

680
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:42,090
I am afraid for the one I love.

681
01:21:42,297 --> 01:21:43,491
Are you going?

682
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,395
Have you no thought for me?

683
01:21:49,337 --> 01:21:51,828
My only thought now is for him.

684
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,371
I'll stay and keep vigil.

685
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,704
Shall I keep vigil with you?

686
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,638
No, I'd like to be alone.

687
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:15,517
You shun me.

688
01:23:17,592 --> 01:23:19,116
I shun mostly myself.

689
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:26,426
We should be on our knees

690
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:29,230
asking his forgiveness.

691
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:33,765
I don't need to ask
forgiveness for anything.

692
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,605
But I know he would have forgiven us.

693
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,082
He stands before God

694
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,443
and accuses us.

695
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:46,916
No, Martin.
He is interceding for us.

696
01:23:47,889 --> 01:23:49,754
For he sees how we suffer.

697
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,380
Do you remember what you said:

698
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:18,442
"lf he were dead..."

699
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,450
You wished him dead.

700
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:23,951
I only thought if.

701
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,820
You did wish him dead.

702
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:29,653
But did you wish, compel him to die?

703
01:24:35,103 --> 01:24:37,401
Have you the power
to wish his death?

704
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:39,972
Answer me.

705
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:43,711
You are driving me to the stake.

706
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:47,173
Had you the power to wish his death?

707
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,712
Come to your senses. Martin!
I love you.

708
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,547
I love you.
That's my only crime.

709
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:57,121
You wished him dead.

710
01:24:57,325 --> 01:25:00,726
Don't make me crazy, Martin!
You must believe me!

711
01:25:01,162 --> 01:25:03,062
I am not the cause of his death.

712
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:10,964
Say it before his coffin.

713
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:22,108
I am not the cause of his death.

714
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:28,813
Do you believe me now?

715
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:30,623
Yes.

716
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,074
Shall we ever find each other again?

717
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,644
Who could prevent it?

718
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,218
The dead.

719
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:03,454
It's not the dead we should fear.

720
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,586
You mean Marte.

721
01:26:21,342 --> 01:26:22,741
I love you.

722
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:25,309
And you love me.

723
01:26:26,281 --> 01:26:28,044
We have sinned together.

724
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,575
And we must also stand together.

725
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,151
If Marte accuses me,

726
01:26:36,124 --> 01:26:37,853
will you stand by me?

727
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,494
I promise.

728
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:44,297
You'll not let go of me?

729
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:50,127
We are tied together so closely,
we can never be parted now.

730
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:57,069
I believe happy days will come again.

731
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,937
Even if we cannot see them now.

732
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:10,805
As the son and
heir of the dearly departed.

733
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:14,437
I stand here, by his coffin

734
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,040
and offer you

735
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:22,689
his mother's, his wife's and my
own thanks for coming here today.

736
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:28,222
My heart is so full of grief that

737
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:33,731
God gave me a father

738
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:38,264
greater and better than most men.

739
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:41,272
Father.

740
01:29:42,176 --> 01:29:44,201
You were such to me

741
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:46,744
that all my days

742
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:51,779
I ought to express it in word and in deed.

743
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:55,681
Now that you have passed away,

744
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,258
I am tormented by the grief I caused you.

745
01:30:01,396 --> 01:30:03,261
If you were alive now

746
01:30:03,931 --> 01:30:06,422
I would be a much better son to you.

747
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:12,532
Forgive me

748
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:17,510
for letting my feelings
have the better of me.

749
01:30:23,484 --> 01:30:25,577
One word more.

750
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:28,879
A word, on behalf of the relatives.

751
01:30:33,861 --> 01:30:38,992
According to custom,
I bear witness before God and man

752
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,292
that my father's sudden death

753
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:45,165
can be laid at the door
of no man or woman.

754
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,891
His wife was with him
when Death came for him.

755
01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:09,987
And his mother and I were
with him when he expired.

756
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:33,081
Let us bless him who lies here.

757
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:39,924
Wait. I will speak now!

758
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:51,138
If his son will not tell the truth,
then his mother must.

759
01:32:01,816 --> 01:32:05,547
My son lies on his coffin murdered.

760
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:09,256
And she who murdered him

761
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,448
sits there!

762
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:16,625
I claim a life for a life.

763
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,863
Don't believe her. I answer for his wife.
She is not responsible.

764
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,640
Every word I have said is true.

765
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:33,112
Believe me. Would I let my father
lie unavenged if...

766
01:32:33,314 --> 01:32:36,112
Yes, you would.

767
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:41,217
For you are under her spell yourself.

768
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,583
With the aid of
the Evil One she ensnared you.

769
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:50,391
With the aid of the Evil One
she killed her husband.

770
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:53,358
I denounce her as a witch.

771
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:56,928
Let her deny it if she dares.

772
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:04,137
<i>Gentlemen, let's look into this matter.

773
01:33:12,453 --> 01:33:14,683
With the aid of the Evil One?

774
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,878
You heard the accusation.

775
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:50,546
So that the full truth may be known.

776
01:33:50,758 --> 01:33:52,020
I demand...

777
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:55,122
That you lay your hand upon the dead

778
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:56,930
and take an oath.

779
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:15,942
Are you ready and willing for such a test?

780
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:39,029
I swear.

781
01:34:41,308 --> 01:34:45,870
I testify...I testify...

782
01:34:59,393 --> 01:35:01,588
So you have your revenge.

783
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:06,800
I killed you

784
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:09,661
with the Evil One's help.

785
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:13,637
And with the Evil One's help

786
01:35:14,575 --> 01:35:15,803
I lured

787
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:18,975
your son into my power.

788
01:35:23,117 --> 01:35:27,315
Now you know. Now you know.

789
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:42,736
I see through my tears,

790
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:47,405
but no one comes

791
01:35:47,942 --> 01:35:49,933
to wipe them away.

792
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,204
Day of Wrath, for pity take

793
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:30,078
My sins away from Satan's grasp

794
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:34,113
And bear up my soul to Heaven at last.

795
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:37,614
Day of Wrath, hear our bidding,

796
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:41,726
Sorrowful, heavenly flood of tears,

797
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:46,097
Save us, Jesus, with your blood.

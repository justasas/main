1
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,484
Crab cakes.

2
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,111
Your favorite.

3
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:29,553
Trying to bribe me,
Mr. Martinez?

4
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,554
It's not a bribe.

5
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:32,853
It's a hot meaI.

6
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,368
Fryer's still leaking.

7
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,414
How's your girlfriend?

8
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,608
He said he was
going to fix it.

9
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:33,151
I tell him, but he keeps
blaming everything on me.

10
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:37,656
If you downgrade us,
he's gonna fire me.

11
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:06,841
See you tomorrow.

12
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,353
Flynn.

13
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,321
He wants to see you.

14
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,089
Hey.

15
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,568
Flynn.

16
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,695
Can I just say something?

17
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,000
If this is about
the crab cakes-

18
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,597
It's not.

19
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,007
Seems your resume
failed to mention

20
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,638
a certain 11 months in jaiI
four years ago.

21
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,681
You've done
a good job here.

22
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:41,015
But we have a responsibility
to the public trust,

23
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,816
and you broke that trust.

24
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,351
I guess I did.

25
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,702
Hi.

26
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:34,837
Hi.

27
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,770
Are you expecting someone?

28
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,344
Yeah.

29
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,005
Oh.

30
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,041
Are you bribing me?

31
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,519
Well, yeah, okay.
All right, it's a little bribe.

32
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,609
# If I had the time to solve
the mystery of your crime #

33
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:14,544
# you know I would #

34
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,686
# If I had to shape the form
of your mechanicaI design #

35
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,778
# you know I would #

36
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,254
Oh, my God.
What are you doing to me?

37
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,689
You can't play this song.

38
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,555
Don't tell me
you don't like this song.

39
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:28,821
Turn it off.

40
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,862
Really?

41
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,124
Turn it off.

42
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,758
All right.

43
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,302
Don't move out.

44
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,537
I already moved out.

45
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,078
Please.
Take the keys.

46
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,306
No, I don't
need the keys.

47
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,370
I have another copy of them.

48
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,507
You can keep them.

49
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,210
After two years,
you know what I know about you?

50
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,082
I know two things
about you:

51
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,450
You take steroids
for dust mites.

52
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,852
It's for my allergies.

53
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,391
And you grind your teeth
when you sleep.

54
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,120
That's why
you get headaches.

55
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,161
That is-
that is not-

56
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,855
that's not true.

57
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,488
You know me. That's not true.

58
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,691
I've told you tons of stuff.

59
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,994
Nat called.
I told you-

60
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,266
He said he's your father.

61
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,535
He's pretty chatty for a dead man.

62
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,007
I- I never said he was dead.

63
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,410
Yes, you did.

64
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,813
Well, he's dead to me, so...

65
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,578
Your name's not even Flynn.

66
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,016
Yes, it is.

67
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,690
All right,
Flynn's my last name.

68
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,418
Hey, hey.

69
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,088
Maggie, I don't know
what kind of stupid stories

70
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,357
he's been telling you,

71
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,456
but whatever it is,
it's got nothing to do with us.

72
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,465
It's him.

73
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,501
He's toxic.

74
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,592
What did he want?

75
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:45,398
He called to borrow money,
right, collect?

76
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,597
I bet he was
reaI charming too.

77
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,696
That's how he works.

78
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:48,763
He pulls you in.

79
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,001
He makes you
feeI sorry for him.

80
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,703
And before you know it,
he's in your pocket.

81
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,712
Don't talk about him like that.

82
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,974
What?

83
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:58,312
He called to say
he was dying, Richie.

84
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,113
He isn't dying,
and don't call me Richie.

85
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:01,949
Why would he say he's dying
if he isn't dying?

86
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:05,149
Because it's the only card
he has left to play.

87
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,782
You don't understand.

88
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,486
He isn't dying.

89
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,493
He's Iying.

90
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,030
Like father,
like son.

91
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,397
I'll take the boat.

92
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,201
Flynn.

93
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:10,240
It's good to see you.

94
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,217
So welcome to my casbah.

95
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:28,791
Here.

96
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:32,565
You like boats.

97
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,696
I taught you to motor a boat.

98
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:34,899
Yes?

99
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,168
No.

100
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,607
Of course,
out on the harbor.

101
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,008
That was Uncle Al.

102
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,309
Al was in Rikers
from that chop shop deaI.

103
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:43,814
No, it was Al.

104
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,407
You're right.

105
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,361
You don't look sick.

106
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,624
Thank you.

107
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,165

00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,722

Santos, huh?

127
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,730
It's one of my aliases.

128
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,006
They have restrictions
on how many times you can call in.

129
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,043
Don't shake your head.

130
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,602
Know what I can scalp
these tickets for?

131
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,011
Cut my overhead
for a month.

132
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,548
So you sit here all day

133
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,641
trying to win
freebies off the radio now?

134
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,114
When did you know me

135
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,053
I got things to do.
How about you?

136

Spandau Ballet.
Duran Duran.

142
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,533
Spandau Ballet.

143
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,071
Is It Spandau Ballet?

144
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,197
Spandau Ballet Is correct.

145
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,433
You just won
two tlckets to the-

146
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,344
You're right.

147
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,414
What am I doing here, Nat?

148
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,427
I can't remember the last time
you called me Dad.

149
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,429
You told me you were dying.

150
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:39,589
You're obviously fine.

151
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,394
So what is it you need me for?

152
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,459
Want me to help you rig a bingo game
at a golden age club?

153
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,027
That's so mean.

154
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,595
I don't do bingo anymore.

155
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,662
Since when?

156
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,106
Since...

157
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,165
you get out.

158
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:59,075
I got a rotten egg
inside my head.

159
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,210
It's a tumor.

160
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,784
Malignant,
inoperable, and growing.

161
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,297
It's preoccipitaI,

162
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,798
is the medicaI
mumbo jumbo.

163
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,219
Sorry.

164
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,220
Me too.

165
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,281
You hungry?

166
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,954
I could use
a cup of coffee.

167
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,894
Let's go.

168
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,541
So what are you
up to these days?

169
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,769
Are you working?

170
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,708
Yeah,
I'm a health inspector.

171
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,440
Really?

172
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,709
Is that good?
How do you do that?

173
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,775
Well, I'm the guy who makes sure
there's no mouse turds in your salad

174
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,944
when you go to a restaurant.

175
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,147
That's good.

176
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,553
What? This is the coffee?

177
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,251
Yeah.

178
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,292
Help yourself.

179
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,925
I need you to drive me
to New Mexico.

180
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,092
There's a treatment
down there,

181
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,229
some kind of experimentaI
holistic thing.

182
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,899
They dunk you in mud,
do chanting.

183
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,100
I don't know.

184
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,269
They need volunteers,
so I get a freebie.

185
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,006
Maybe it's
a waste of time,

186
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,015
but I figure,
what the heck?

187
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,914
Won't take
more than a week, tops.

188
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,850
A week?

189
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,979
Are you serious?

190
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:43,987
Yeah.

191
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,023
I'm not taking you.

192
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,455
Why can't you
drive yourself?

193
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,514
Drive myself?

194
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:51,256
This thing's
messing with my vision.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,763
Why can't you get
somebody else?

196
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,231
Don't you have any friends?

197
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,497
None that I don't owe money to.

198
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,559
So take a plane.

199
00:13:58,637 --> 00:13:59,626
You got all those vouchers.

200
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,933
Why don't you use them?

201
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,871
Doctor says altitude's bad
also for my brain.

202
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,874
Makes for swelling.

203
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,171
Turn in here.

204
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,837
I want to show you something.

205
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,385
Hey.

206
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,751
Hey, Nat.
Morning.

207
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,754
Meet my son.

208
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,222
What a thrill.

209
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,452
Nice to meet you.

210
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,087
Barney's been storing it for me
in his humidor.

211
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,358
It keeps it soft.

212
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,263
Here,
try it on.

213
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:41,711
Hm?

214
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,271
What do you
think it's worth?

215
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,282
I don't know.

216
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,342
Take a guess.

217
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,511
Nothing.

218
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:53,354
This is one of four jackets
worn by Steve McQueen

219
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,790
in The Great Escape.

220
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,118
Where'd you get this?

221
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,290
Bert Kruger.

222
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,629
You probably
don't remember him.

223
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,102
He had car dealerships
when you were a kid.

224
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,639
Kruger Motors.
No.

225
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,265
Your mother worked there.

226
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,139
Anyway,

227
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,179
he won the jacket
in some charity raffle.

228
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,508
He gave it
to your mother.

229
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,017
She left It behlnd
when we broke up.

230
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,747
I was going to sell it,
but then I thought, "No,

231
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,382
"I keep it for Flynny.

232
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,757
If he wants,
after I die, he can sell it. "

233
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:30,852
It's a nest egg.

234
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,056
It's a bribe.

235
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,291
It's a jacket.

236
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:36,967
A nice jacket.

237
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:37,968
Looks good on you,

238
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,504
don't you think?

239
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,630
Thanks, Marty.

240
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,682
I have to know,
are you my wheeI man or what?

241
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:01,354
Jeez.

242
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,022
You know, you're really
putting me on the spot here.

243
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,860
I mean, I got a job.

244
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:07,864
I got commitments.

245
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:09,525
I only brought
an overnight bag.

246
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,535
The fact is,
I don't want you to do this.

247
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:12,729
I need you to.

248
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,103
I need to make things
copasetic between us.

249
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,801
I know I've been
a terrible father.

250
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,572
It's not a thing
I can ignore.

251
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,773
Sometimes,
for no particular reason,

252
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,478
life hauls off and knocks you flat,

253
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:28,952
slams you so hard against the ground,

254
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,216
you think that all your insides are busted.

255
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,751
But if you look for something
to replace what's broken,

256
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,788
if you're lucky, you can find it.

257
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,803
You're all I have.

258
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,915
You really
got a brain tumor?

259
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,284
You think I'd kid around
about a tumor?

260
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,186
I do.

261
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,027
Come on.

262
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,495
Just say yes.

263
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,626
Just say yes.

264
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,634
All right.

265
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,500
All right.
You're the one.

266
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,061
All right.

267
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,040
You're pure,
pure flame.

268
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,166
I'll drive you.

269
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,175
Blood is thick.

270
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,939
All right.
All right.

271
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:27,944
Know what I'm saying?

272
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:28,980
You behave.

273
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,175
And these glue traps
are just plaln gross.

274
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:03,340
Hlgh technology arrlves
wlth the push-

275
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,715
Thing you do now
is try and forget it.

276
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,276
How, Pa?

277
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,584
How you gonna
forget somethlng llke that?

278
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,454
What I'm trylng to say Is,

279
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,822
now and then,

280
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:19,660
for no good reason
a man can figure out, life will just...

281
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,427
haul off
and knock hlm flat,

282
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,968
slam hlm agaln'
the ground so hard

283
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,197
It seems llke
all hls Insldes Is busted.

284
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,001
And you start looking around
for something good

285
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,632
to take the place
of the bad.

286
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,269
As a generaI rule,
you can find it.

287
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:50,957
Think you packed enough?

288
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,022
CooI, no?

289
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,896
New regulations
at the airlines

290
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,335
say you got 60 days
to pick up unclaimed baggage.

291
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,462
After that...

292
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,269
# You belong to me #

293
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,775
This is the good stuff.

294
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,208
Louis Vuitton.

295
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:09,410
You're not
golng to be sorry.

296
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,244
I got this
so totally worked out.

297
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,285
And you don't have to dip
in your pocket for a thing,

298
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,514
zlp, zllch,
not a crouton.

299
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,680
This trip's on me,

300
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:20,520
ever last pillow chocolate.

301
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,082
That is good news.

302
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,128
Of course.

303
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,857
I got us set up
in five-star places.

304
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:26,898
Wait'll you see.

305
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,097
You're going
to be shocked and awed.

306
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,137
Let's go.

307
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,186
What zip code
did you park in?

308
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,923
Oh, here's our ride.

309
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:01,931
Are you shittin' me?

310
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,629
Free wheels and gas
for a year.

311
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,672
AII I have to do
is drive 1,000 miles a month.

312
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,297
No way.

313
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,363
No, no, no.

314
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,534
Why not?

315
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,702
No, I'm not
getting in there.

316
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,710
I'm not
getting in that.

317
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,803
Don't be a snob.

318
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,310
No.

319
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,476
You know what?

320
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,850
You are completely insane.

321
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,616
You're gone.
Going, going, gone.

322
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,489
Get in the car.

323
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,006
Don't-
don't put that there.

324
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,016
Put that over here.

325
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,111
No, don't put that on.

326
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,155
That stinks.

327
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,323
What about your Maggie?

328
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,450
Is it serious?

329
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,289
'Cause she's
answering your telephone.

330
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,421
It is.

331
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,896
Don't do what I did.

332
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,296
Don't let go
of something speciaI,

333
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:12,360
'cause, in my experience,
it comes along once.

334
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,404
Okay.

335
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,099
Thanks for the advice.

336
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,165
She dumped you, right?

337
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,236
Yeah, I'm psychic.

338
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,009
Turn in here.

339
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,242
We need to make a stop.

340
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,511
What, you got to take a piss?

341
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,052
No, make a right.
I got a surprise.

342
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,315
Just make a right.

343
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,016
What kind of surprise?

344
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,318
We just got on the road.

345
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,223
I was feeling good.

346
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,130
Little trim, a spruce-up,

347
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,495
get back on the highway.

348
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,555
I don't need a little trim.

349
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,566
I promise you,

350
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,535
these women are good,

351
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,832
and it's not
going to cost a dime.

352
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:47,929
What the heck?

353
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,530
They don't have their license?
Big deaI.

354
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,405
They're about to be
very good at what they do.

355
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,080
Mm.

356
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,014
Yeah.

357
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,986
There you go.

358
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:06,388
Yeah, Nat is one
of our favorites.

359
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,390
He's up for anything.

360
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:08,517
Oh, yeah?

361
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:11,221
He let me put his hair
in a Mohawk last summer.

362
00:22:11,296 --> 00:22:12,422
No.

363
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,624
I bet it was great
growing up with a dad like that.

364
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,565
Yeah.

365
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,729
You know, if it wasn't for Nat,
I wouldn't be here.

366
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,602
Tuition's reaI pricey.

367
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,867
What, he paid your tuition?

368
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,432
Not exactly.

369
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,603
But he knew
a guy whose wife

370
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,477
was having a hard time
getting knocked up,

371
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:33,950
so your dad thought of me,
if you know what I mean.

372
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,317
I'm afraid to ask.

373
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:38,288
He sold my eggs.

374
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,552
Got me enough
for a new car too.

375
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,058
Yep, Nat's the bomb.

376
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,152
Sherry, what have you done?

377
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:47,255
So much better.

378
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:48,731
You like it?

379
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,131
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,897
Tips.

381
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,666
All around excellent service.

382
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,672
30 free minutes.

383
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:56,673
Enjoy.

384
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,767
Thank you.

385
00:22:58,844 --> 00:22:59,811
I'm crazy about you.

386
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,810
Okay.

387
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,143
Good?

388
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,207
They only do
one haircut here, huh?

389
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,684
I always knew you had big hair.

390
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:12,588
Women; they take care
of everything for me.

391
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:13,954
They're saints.

392
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,620
Flynn.

393
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,098
There's a good one.

394
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,099
What was that for?

395
00:23:23,168 --> 00:23:24,157
Are you trying to blind me?

396
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,498
It's for my wallet.

397
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,664
When's the last time
I had a picture of you?

398
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,607
My mug shot.

399
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:33,041
Does that thing
even work anyway?

400
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,774
Three box tops and $1.20
post and handling, of course.

401
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,383
Oh.

402
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,918
30 days unlimited airtime.

403
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,391
It's promotionaI.

404
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,427
Take a couple.

405
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:50,620
Hey, let me
ask you a question.

406
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,026
Yeah?

407
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,190
When was the last time
you actually paid for something?

408
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,063
You know how much
I'm out-of-pocket

409
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,066
in the last six months?

410
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,295
50 cents.

411
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,463
$900, and I've wanted for nothing.

412
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,803
Rent, food, sundries,

413
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,000
entertainment, even.

414
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:06,066
That works out
to under $5 a day.

415
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,635
Well, if you stopped eating,
you'd cut it down to three.

416
00:24:08,713 --> 00:24:10,943
Do you know how many people
could do what I'm doing?

417
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,382
You may see
a curious old person,

418
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,615
but I see
a good-looking older guy

419
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,588
who's making the system
work for him.

420
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:23,924
I do quite well,
you know, in my modest way.

421
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:26,156
It's sort of monkish.

422
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,892
AII I need is my bowI.

423
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:32,369
I go from village to village,
tapping with my stick.

424
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,873
Who taught you
how to drive?

425
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,772
You're a terrible driver.

426
00:24:37,843 --> 00:24:39,470
You're a lot like me.

427
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,266
Nat.

428
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,869
- Hey.
- Huh?

429
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:07,870
- You all right.
- Yeah.

430
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:09,372
Food.

431
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,601
Let's eat.

432
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,302
Who planned this route?
It's like an EKG.

433
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:14,140
It's worked out exactly.

434
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,543
We do a trip down memory lane,

435
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:19,448
plus there's an IHOP and a Chevron station
every 300 miles.

436
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,485
I get free gas.

437
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,713
It's the best
of all possible worlds.

438
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:23,913
Let's go.

439
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,626
Every day's my birthday,

440
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,824
'cause I got a guy
who does drivers licenses.

441
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,867
Watch.

442
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,861
Welcome to IHOP.

443
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,869
Thank you, darling.

444
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,371
Is Jones on the grill?

445
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:43,236
Oh, God, no. He died years ago.

446
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:44,832
No. Enough said.

447
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,172
May he rest in peace.

448
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,302
We'll have
a window booth.

449
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,404
Window booth.

450
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,574
You might not remember Jonesy.

451
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:53,584
WonderfuI Reuben sandwich.

452
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:55,347
Thank you.

453
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,850
What's the most
expensive dish you have?

454
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:03,952
Chicken combo.

455
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,327
It's $11.99.

456
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,592
He'll have two.

457
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,600
Yes.

458
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,727
Ma'am?
Mm-hmm.

459
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:12,997
Right here.

460
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,538
Oh.

461
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:15,573
Thank you.

462
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,112
Make a wish.

463
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,156
Nah-
Grab the bone.

464
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:33,554
I don't do that stuff.
Come on.

465
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,853
No, it's voodoo stuff.

466
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,052
Come on.
Nobody's thinking about it.

467
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:37,151
Grab the bone.

468
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:41,164
I'm not superstitious.
Grab the bone.

469
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,760
I wish I could run across
my own private beach

470
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:49,364
and jump in the ocean.

471
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,635
What about you?

472
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:51,801
You wanted a boat.

473
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,367
I used to want
a lot of things.

474
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,076
Altoona.

475
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:03,609
We had good times here.

476
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:06,179
Are you serious?

477
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:11,456
This was our turf.

478
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,553
Father and son.

479
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,328
You want to know
the last time I called you Dad?

480
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,501
It was right here in Altoona.

481
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,541
I said, "Thanks, Dad,"

482
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:26,771
right after they found me
guilty of grand larceny.

483
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:31,412
I took my eye off the ball.

484
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,384
Definitely, I did.

485
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,012
I was willing
to do the time.

486
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,055
You had a record.

487
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,956
You would've done
ten years.

488
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:49,025
And then you hired that clown
impersonating a lawyer.

489
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,761
And he guaranteed
I'd get off.

490
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,201
Everybody said he was tops.

491
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:55,569
Hey, look at me.

492
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:05,007
11 months, a week,
and 3 days at Rahway, Dad.

493
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,608
# Many happy returns of the day to you #

494
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,087
# Many happy returns #

495
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:13,317
# Happy birthday #

496
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,383
# Many happy returns
from IHOP #

497
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,553
That's all right.
Thank you.

498
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,187
Which one's
the birthday boy?

499
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,231
That's me.
Thank you.

500
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,230
Well, Happy Birthday.
All right, thanks.

501
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,857
Don't mention it.

502
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,630
Happy Birthday.

503
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,521
Can I pick them or what?

504
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,358
Wow.

505
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,362
Whose house is it?

506
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,023
Our new best friend.

507
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,536
His name's Nobody,
and su casa's our casa.

508
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,169
For-sale listings
in 2,700 counties.

509
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:44,374
I don't know why I was thinking
you might spring for a moteI.

510
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,541
Let's go.

511
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,413
Oh, hey,
I'm not going in there.

512
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,451
Why not?

513
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,816
It's empty.

514
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:49,819
I'm an ex-con,

515
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:51,048
and it's illegaI.

516
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,453
Whoop.

517
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:53,548
Huh?

518
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,058
Let's check out
the bed sltuatlon.

519
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,219
I hope they got a firm rack.

520
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,887
These doggies are tired.

521
00:29:58,963 --> 00:29:59,930
Sweet dreams.

522
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm just going to go
sleep in the car.

523
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,931
Yeah, sleep in the car.

524
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:25,988
Hl, thls Is Maggle.

525
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:26,989
Please leave a message.

526
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:32,289
Hl, are you there?

527
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,666
I'm on the road...

528
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:40,295
with my father.

529
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,137
I think I'm going to be gone
a few days.

530
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:46,837
You were right.

531
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:48,105
It hurts me
to say this,

532
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,446
but the only person
who really knows me is him.

533
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,510
And that scares the hell out of me.

534
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,113
Anyway...

535
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,216
I don't know.
Maybe it's too late.

536
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,624
But even If you hate me,

537
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:08,132
I want you to know
who you're hatlng.

538
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:12,863
The thlng Is,
I'm not from Canada.

539
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:16,031
I was born In Secaucus,
New Jersey.

540
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,098
I don't have
any brothers or sisters.

541
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,404
I grew up
without a mother

542
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,570
because my father
drove her away.

543
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:22,908
I-

544
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,744
Promotlonal perlod ended.

545
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:27,284
To purchase addltlonal mlnutes,
press 7.

546
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,517
Hello?

547
00:32:13,064 --> 00:32:14,156
Nat!

548
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,494
I got a gun!

549
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:17,499
Whoa.

550
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:19,058
Richie.

551
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,126
Don't call me Richie.

552
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:21,466
Flynny.

553
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,699
Always good
to see you.

554
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,241
Oh.

555
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,903
I slept
like a polar bear.

556
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,138
So good.

557
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:29,338
I need coffee.

558
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,850
There's a wonderfuI moteI
83 miles away.

559
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,886
Comps on coffee
and Danlsh.

560
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:40,323
The 7-Eleven.

561
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,416
Or we could
buy a cup now.

562
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,653
We're doing
so good here.

563
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,131
Let's not blow it
on luxury items.

564
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:55,539
Come on.
Come on.

565
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,573
Perfect.

566
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,016
Take it easy.

567
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:08,245
Lovely.

568
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,379
And It Is just
the safest nelghborhood.

569
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:14,189
Hi.

570
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,520
Hello.

571
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,652
Can I help you?

572
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,390
Wish you could, darling.

573
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:21,091
The house is wonderfuI.
We like it.

574
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,894
The fact is,
my partner and I

575
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,731
are looking for something
a little more feng shui-ish.

576
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,931
The house Is wonderful,
though, Isn't It?

577
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,939
Vaulted celllngs.

578
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,100
Take it easy, honey.

579
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,767
It's the first place we've seen.

580
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,833
It's got everything.

581
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:35,242
Thank you.

582
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:44,455
Yikes.

583
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,583
We escaped.

584
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,117
Last time I drove
across country,

585
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,116
it took me four days.

586
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,117
Did I tell you that?

587
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:16,551
No.

588
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,782
A lifetime ago.

589
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:21,347
Four perfect days.

590
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,884
We wound up on a beach
in Mexico, freezing.

591
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:28,557
White sand,
clear blue water,

592
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:32,501
your mother looking up at me
like I was the one.

593
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,664
That's when I asked her
to marry me.

594
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,504
Then we did it,

595
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,271
twice, maybe three times.

596
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:44,140
Yeah, shake your head.

597
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,341
These are memories.

598
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:51,321
You'll see what it's like
when things stop happening on command.

599
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,051
Half mast.

600
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,958
I'm not even dead yet.

601
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,461
What are you saying,
you're impotent?

602
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:02,260
I'm saying, I can't get it up
most of the time.

603
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,265
Since when?

604
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,528
Since...

605
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,866
Uh, it's hard to say.

606
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,530
Couple of years,
maybe five.

607
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,130
Well, have you tried
taking those pills?

608
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,140
They're junk.

609
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,335
They don't work.

610
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,900
Where'd you buy them,
off a fruit truck?

611
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,104
What difference
does it make?

612
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,441
They don't work.
I don't work.

613
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,038
Clock's ticking.

614
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,916
One last frolic
is not going to stop that, is it?

615
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,781
Use this for the gas.

616
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,916
The Sweet'N Low people
will pick it up.

617
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,120
Be back in a flash.

618
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,038
Room service, please.

619
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:19,633
Room servlce.
How may I help you?

620
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:24,204
Yes, we'd like to order up some brunch,
my wife and I.

621
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:25,476
What room, please?

622
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,211
Room 120.

623
00:36:27,285 --> 00:36:28,217
All rlght.

624
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,253
Thank you so much.

625
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,252
Please hold.

626
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:32,221
Yes, I'll wait.

627
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,418
Thank you.

628
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,096
Sir.

629
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:47,331
Could you leave the tray
outside the door?

630
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:49,270
My wife is under the weather,

631
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,798
and I'm trying
not to disturb her.

632
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,969
Thank you so much.

633
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,446
May I add the tip
to the check?

634
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,482
Sure.

635
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,388
There. That's for you.

636
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,821
Thank you so much.

637
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,382
Thank you, sir.
Please.

638
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,087
Thank you.

639
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,708
Hl, thls Is Maggle.

640
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:25,707
Please leave a message.

641
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,902
Hey, it's me.

642
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,175
Are you there?

643
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,685
Are you there?
Are you there? Are you there?

644
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:38,347
Okay, another confession.

645
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:42,722
Um, thls Is...

646
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,489
Thls Is a llttle trlcky.

647
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,623
I'm gonna-I'm gonna tell you
a story, okay?

648
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,825
Here we go.

649
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,868
My father
drove a beat-up Mustang

650
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,631
wlth 150,000 mlles on It,

651
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,865
about the tlme a sane person
buys a new car.

652
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,872
But not him.

653
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,738
He rents a new Mustang,

654
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:01,835
strips it, and swaps the parts
with his hunk of junk.

655
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,437
Then he returns the rentaI,
complains it's a lemon,

656
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:07,075
and gets his $69 back.

657
00:38:07,151 --> 00:38:09,051
But guess what.

658
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,052
Thls tlme,

659
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,284
they nailed him.

660
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:16,485
And guess what else.

661
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,324
My name was on the lease.

662
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:20,364
Okay?

663
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,592
You can guess the rest.

664
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,808
All right.

665
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,867
I'm going to call you back.

666
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,485
I'm thinking
about those lobster dinners

667
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:47,149
we pinched from that place
up in Bar Harbor.

668
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,384
Could you forget the taste,

669
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,859
the flavor,
the freshness?

670
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,556
It was like the ocean.

671
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:54,563
Eat something.

672
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,726
You can't
live on coffee.

673
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:58,734
I'm tired.

674
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:01,067
You're depressed.

675
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,698
Anybody in your situation's
got to feeI like junk.

676
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:07,107
The trick is to take your mind
off getting dumped.

677
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,612
Every obstacle
is an opportunity.

678
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,808
Think about it this way.

679
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,078
You have a clean slate.

680
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,449
No girI.
No job.

681
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,480
No nothing
to hold you back.

682
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,685
How did you know
about my job?

683
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,395
You sent that letter
to the health department?

684
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:31,731
The whole thing
was beneath you.

685
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,599
You got me fired.

686
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:34,933
I did you a favor.

687
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:38,338
You want to spend the next
30 years punching a clock?

688
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:41,734
Huh?

689
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,076
Things are out there.

690
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,740
Hm?

691
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:47,943
Life is out there.

692
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,289
One day,
you're going to say thank you.

693
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,222
Thank you, Dad.

694
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,352
Oh, it was nothing.

695
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,726
What's wrong?

696
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,288
Come on, Flynn.

697
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:03,924
Don't be so serious, huh?

698
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,332
What are you dolng?

699
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,768
What am I doing?

700
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:07,826
I'm spending the night

701
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,133
in a room
that you're paying for.

702
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,332
And then tomorrow,

703
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,035
I'm on the first train,
bus, or pickup truck

704
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:14,976
the hell out of here.

705
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,172
Yeah.

706
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:33,054
Your mother and I got married
in a HoJo's.

707
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:36,429
They wanted $800
for the banquet room.

708
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,161
Back then,

709
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,703
good for me,

710
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:47,335
I was able to swing a deaI
with the night manager.

711
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:52,348
We had a tastefuI,
low-key ceremony in the lobby

712
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:54,441
for $50.

713
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,817
Who knew the difference?

714
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,482
Who could tell
the difference?

715
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,494
Flynn?

716
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,405
I'm going to go
have a drink...

717
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,171
Meet some people,

718
00:41:22,246 --> 00:41:24,373
have some fun.

719
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,177
Hi. Bill and Betty Richmond.

720
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,185
Hi.

721
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,482
Hey.

722
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,284
Thank you.

723
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:42,062
Sounds like a shindig.

724
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,430
I wouldn't know, sir.

725
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,764
Good blazer.

726
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,269
I had one
almost like it.

727
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,203
Different buttons.

728
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,205
Brooks Brothers.

729
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,241
Sears.

730
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,775
Solid store.

731
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,401
Good return policy.

732
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,608
Is there something
I can help you with?

733
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,978
Ah, shooting the breeze.

734
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:05,215
I must say, that's some
serious hair you got there.

735
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:06,881
When's the last time
you cut it?

736
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,049
Nine years.

737
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,218
That's really something.

738
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:12,819
Actually, another 13 inches,
and I beat the county record.

739
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,364
Good for you.

740
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:18,197
Of course, Dory Jensen's got
the state sewn up at 5'2".

741
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,931
Oh, hair is important.

742
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:23,030
I'm a fan.

743
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,734
I've always had good hair.

744
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,935
It's nice we can share that.

745
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:28,706
From back east?

746
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:29,711
Brooklyn.

747
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:32,340
Queens.

748
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,010
Do you mind if I go inside
and have a cocktaiI?

749
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,485
I'm thirsty.

750
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:41,355
Sales of teeth-bleaching kits
brighten...

751
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,161
Up 2.8%
in the last quarter,

752
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,062
while psoriasis ointment
dried up substantially...

753
00:42:49,833 --> 00:42:53,098
up 5.5%.

754
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:56,367
And finally,
in our laxative department,

755
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,035
I'm pleased to announce that
back orders have loosened up.

756
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,378
Who is that?

757
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,505
You're kidding, right?

758
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,311
No.

759
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,180
That's the new CEO.

760
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,947
Wow, he's so boring.

761
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,250
Jesus.

762
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:21,898
I don't think
we've met.

763
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,126
Rick Carlson.

764
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,792
Sales rep of the year.

765
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,800
Of course.

766
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:26,995
Kudos, Rick.

767
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:28,299
You put us all to shame.

768
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,839
Thank you very much.

769
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:30,965
I didn't catch your name.

770
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,440
Richie Flynn.

771
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:33,635
What office
are you in, Flynn?

772
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:34,643
Topeka.

773
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,543
Oh, you work
with Tim Webber then?

774
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,740
T- Bird?

775
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:39,373
I like to think
he works with me.

776
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,012
You know, that bastard
hasn't even shown up yet.

777
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,919
Too cheap to buy a suit.

778
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,254
With the bonus
he got last year,

779
00:43:48,325 --> 00:43:50,088
he got buy us all
brand-new suits

780
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,027
and maybe a little bit
of plastic surgery

781
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,064
for that wife of his.

782
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,190
Yeah, but she's
a nice person.

783
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:57,699
Nice ain't got
nothing to do with it.

784
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:58,860
Woof.

785
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,233
That's right.

786
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,837
This is the good stuff.

787
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,341
Thank the little woman for that.

788
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,878
She put this whole thing together.

789
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:10,379
But between you and me,

790
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,505
that's the only thing

791
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,277
she put together
in the last three weeks.

792
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:14,544
Honey?

793
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,983
Excuse me.

794
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,714
Say hello
to Rlchle Flynn.

795
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:18,686
He's in Webber's office.

796
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:19,780
My wlfe, Clalre.

797
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:22,223
WonderfuI. Thank you.

798
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,350
Congratulations.

799
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:26,453
Oh, yes.

800
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,829
Are these hybrid tea roses
in the centerpieces?

801
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,027
Well, yes.

802
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:36,197
Brilliant.

803
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:38,605
Thank you for noticing.

804
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,769
Thank you for making
a beautifuI thing tonight.

805
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,209
Thank you so much.

806
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:44,179
The whole thing,
it's so well done, you know?

807
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,983
It's my pleasure.

808
00:44:51,655 --> 00:44:53,179
Do you garden?

809
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,315
I do.

810
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:55,517
Me too.
Oh, that's nice.

811
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,389
I like to grow things.

812
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,224
Oh, do you cook?

813
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,389
I do.

814
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,509
# Do you remember #

815
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:18,946
# the very first night
of September #

816
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,745
# Love was
changing the minds #

817
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,286
# of pretenders #

818
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:28,655
# while chasing
the clouds away #

819
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:30,819
# Our hearts are ringing #

820
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,295
# in the key
that our souls were singing #

821
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,594
# as we dance
in the night #

822
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,601
# Remember #

823
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:41,866
# how the stars
stole the night away #

824
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,737
Hey, here's Webber.

825
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,537
Hey.
Hey.

826
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,771
See that jackass over there
danclng wlth my wlfe?

827
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,108
Yeah.

828
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,977
You know hlm?

829
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:56,612
Never seen him
before in my life.

830
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:58,154
Hold this.

831
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,336
# My thoughts
are with you #

832
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,237
# holding hands
with the heart #

833
00:46:18,308 --> 00:46:19,240
# to see you #

834
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,072
Whoa, whoa,
whoa there, buddy.

835
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,476
Who the hell are you?

836
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,237
This is Tim Webber,

837
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:26,942
your "boss. "

838
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,144
Oh!

839
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,314
Whoa,
wait a minute.

840
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,550
Why are we fighting?

841
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,614
We're not fighting yet,
buddy.

842
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:36,624
Are you all right?

843
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:37,785
I'm all right.
You all right?

844
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,192
I'm not all right, no.

845
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,730
Who the hell are you?
I'm Richie.

846
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:41,730
I don't know
who you are.

847
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,857
Webber has no idea
who you are.

848
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,332
T- Bone,
I'm Rich-

849
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:45,766
I'm gonna
knock your teeth out, paI.

850
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:46,768
Let me.

851
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,862
Excuse me.
Can we step aside?

852
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:49,906
Step aside, please.

853
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:52,532
This man
is under my orders.

854
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:54,474
Nat Santos,
county health department.

855
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:55,534
Apologlze
for the tlmlng,

856
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:56,704
but we're in the midst

857
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,806
of an undercover investigation
of the premises,

858
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,976
which has severaI outstanding
health code violations.

859
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,576
Are you telling me
you send this guy here

860
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,554
to drink our booze
and make the moves on my wife?

861
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,884
I ought
to kick your ass.

862
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, let's just call the cops.

863
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:09,724
Sure, call 'em.

864
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,055
And while you're dialing,

865
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,459
I'm going to go ahead
and shut this party down.

866
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,621
Are you in charge here?

867
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,629
No.

868
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:18,664
Rick, your wife did
kind of put this together, huh?

869
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:20,396
Great, why don't you
come with me.

870
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,734
Let's go have a look
at the kitchen.

871
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:24,671
Yeah.

872
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:25,969
Yeah, let's go.

873
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:30,776
So I'm showing
114 degrees here.

874
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,509
That's 10 degrees
below my standards,

875
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,107
20 degrees below
most restaurant standards.

876
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,276
That good enough
for you?

877
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,410
Uh.

878
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:37,510
No, it isn't.

879
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:38,919
It's not good enough
for me either.

880
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,422
Throw that out, please.

881
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:43,620
You ever had
a foodborne illness?

882
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,525
Have you ever launched
stomach contents north?

883
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,496
Have you had vomit
come up at high velocity?

884
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:49,589
It's a hideous situation
in the end.

885
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:52,191
Give me diarrhea
over vomit any day.

886
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:57,096
I am not
liking the look of this.

887
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:58,232
What is going on?

888
00:47:58,308 --> 00:47:59,297
Why is he on the floor?

889
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,866
Honey, relax, okay?

890
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,003
Give me a minute.

891
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,014
Accumulation of unidentified
organic matter,

892
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:09,280
harborage,
or conditions conducive...

893
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:12,481
to vermin.

894
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,488
Do you know
what this is?

895
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,184
Is it poop?

896
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:17,659
I'm going
to go check the buffet.

897
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,457
Not the buffet.

898
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,757
These are decent people.

899
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,662
Give them a break.

900
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,827
I've seen him shut people down
over a chafing dish.

901
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,530
Could I talk to you
for one second?

902
00:48:27,604 --> 00:48:31,233
I'll tell you, you know,
a little cash wouldn't hurt.

903
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,832
The entire agency is corrupt.

904
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,002
Everybody knows that.

905
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,476
No problem.
No problem, buddy.

906
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:41,381
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks.

907
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,782
Yeah.
Thanks.

908
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:45,447
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

909
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,114
What a nice guy
he was.

910
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,281
Get in.

911
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,806
I should've left you there.

912
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,812

00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,995
A '63 Corvair,
best car I ever drove.

930
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:13,298
First time I got nookie
was in this car.

931
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,203
Well, similar.

932
00:51:16,273 --> 00:51:17,968

No, for my wallet.

I can take a plcture.

00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:32,251
Say, "Holy moly, guacamole. "

00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,023
Nlce.

939
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,229

00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:54,093
This is good.

956
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:55,670
Ooh.

957
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,570
I taught you that.

958
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:59,006
It was Uncle Al.

959
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:01,703
Uncle Al,
Uncle Al, blah, blah.

960
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,246
He hated my cat,
so I kicked him out.

961
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:08,716
Did you know
that the question mark-

962
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:10,912
What question mark?

963
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:12,386
The symboI,
the question mark,

964
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,184
like at the end of a sentence,
it's a question.

965
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,225
Like in grammar?
Yeah.

966
00:53:16,293 --> 00:53:18,818
It was originally
a hieroglyphic symboI

967
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,524
which came from the view
of the ass of a cat

968
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,725
as it's walking away from you.

969
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,461
Explain.

970
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,230
Well, because when a cat
walks away from you,

971
00:53:27,304 --> 00:53:30,102
you feeI insecure;
you're unsure of yourself; it's doubt.

972
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,731
I see.
A question mark.

973
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,139
You mean like the thing,
the taiI-

974
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,700
Yeah, you look at it,
you see the taiI.

975
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,767
And then the-
Pfft.

976
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:36,777
Pop.

977
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,438
The a-hole.
The asshole.

978
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,710
Well, sounds like Al.

979
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,149
Dubious a-hole.

980
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:47,147
What do you got
against Al?

981
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,384
You'll have
to ask him.

982
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:50,289
He taught you
everything else you know.

983
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,532
All right, left or right?

984
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,540
Which way, left or right?

985
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,541
Left.

986
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:07,542
Left or right?

987
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:09,602
Left. Left.

988
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:11,243
Here's the house.

989
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,906
Pull in here.

990
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:16,478
Do you know
this person?

991
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,954
Yes, I do.

992
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,014
Think back.

993
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,889
Dolores Jones.

994
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,359
She won a beauty contest.

995
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:28,158
You had the hots for her;
I sensed it.

996
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,222
Yeah, she was my babysitter.

997
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:31,961
Yes. She moved here.

998
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:33,297
We stayed in touch.

999
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:36,032
I thought you and I could
stop in for a visit.

1000
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,266
You're older now.

1001
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,830
Maybe you could,
you know-

1002
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:40,034
how you say in English?

1003
00:54:42,078 --> 00:54:43,545
SeaI the deaI.

1004
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,774
Why is it guys with E.D.
can't stop talking about sex?

1005
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,111
What's wrong?

1006
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,549
You got something
against fornication?

1007
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,551
Hey.

1008
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,850
Hey!

1009
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:53,889
Look at you.

1010
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:54,889
You're early.

1011
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:56,084
I was just about
to take a dip.

1012
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,148
There you are.

1013
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,024
Time stands still.

1014
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:00,027
Here he is.

1015
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:02,530
Skinny Flynny?

1016
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:04,157
Look who filled out.

1017
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:05,826
He's gun shy.

1018
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:06,869
Come on in.

1019
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:09,564
I was just about
to make some cocktails.

1020
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,607
Put your bags anywhere.

1021
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:14,508
Not there.
Over there.

1022
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,544
This is reaI nice.

1023
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:16,738
Oh, don't be polite.

1024
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,747
You know I never stay
in one place too long.

1025
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,180
Isn't that right, Nat?

1026
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,410
We got ants
in our pants.

1027
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,849
Yes, we do.

1028
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,443
Come on out.

1029
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,512
Before we take off,
how about a dalqulrl?

1030
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:28,557
Absolutely.

1031
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,220
So, Flynny,
last thing I heard,

1032
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:35,958
you were selllng
washers and dryers.

1033
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,021
Oh, I know.

1034
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,432
You're shutting down restaurants.

1035
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,799
Yeah, didn't work out.

1036
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,237
How about grabbing the rum
and topping off these drinks?

1037
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,797
Sure.

1038
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:48,343
And I am going to go
put some clothes on.

1039
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,639
Oh, no argument.

1040
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:51,374
Never.

1041
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,813
Uh-oh.

1042
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:53,974
Hey, sorry.

1043
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,745
Make yourselves comfortable.

1044
00:55:58,822 --> 00:55:59,982
Oh, he will.

1045
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,990
Comfortable?
That's my motto.

1046
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,355
CooI, no?

1047
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,691
I told you
I would set us up.

1048
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,296
Don't hold back.

1049
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:15,498
No, thou shalt not perish
by plague or by famine yet.

1050
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,540
So shalt thou perish
by pestilence,

1051
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:20,337
so why bother shaving?

1052
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:22,207
You're so weird.

1053
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:23,267
I'm gonna catch some rays

1054
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,280
by the pooI.

1055
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,782
Why don't you take her someplace
nice and buy her a cocktaiI.

1056
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:29,409
Here, for later.
Oh, no.

1057
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,953
A glow-in-the-dark condom?

1058
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,487
They're extra large,
jumbo.

1059
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,489
They're glow-in-the-dark,
for God's sake.

1060
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,489
Check for pinholes.

1061
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,355
Might be Chinese.

1062
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,658
Ooh. Ouch.

1063
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,664
Look at you.

1064
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,461
Scheherazade.

1065
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:45,865
She could wln
a beauty contest

1066
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,766
as we speak.

1067
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,930
Yeah, well, you're not so bad
yourself there, Daddy.

1068
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:50,938
Ooh.

1069
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:52,133
Yeah.

1070
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:54,301
Okay, sugar shorts,
let's hit the road.

1071
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:55,639
Let's do it.

1072
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,736
Hold down the fort.

1073
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:01,546
I'm gonna clean the kitchen.

1074
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:16,999
Perfect.

1075
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:22,796
So...

1076
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,272
I take you're not
still babysitting.

1077
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,330
Why, do you need one?

1078
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,502
Mm, from time to time, yeah.

1079
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,541
So what are you doing?

1080
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,049
This and that.

1081
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,915
Yeah?
Yeah.

1082
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:38,044
Got my notary's license.

1083
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,053
Did you?
Mm-hmm.

1084
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,350
Congratulations.

1085
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:44,086
Well, it was Nat's idea.

1086
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,652
He's so thoughtfuI.

1087
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,960
Remember when he got me
that pink briefcase

1088
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,625
when I graduated high schooI?

1089
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:54,135
Yeah, I also remember
he didn't pay for it.

1090
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,899
It was still nice.

1091
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,872
All right.

1092
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,247
You used to have
the most pitifuI crush on me.

1093
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,181
I did not.

1094
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:10,344
I was your dream girI.

1095
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,184
Yeah, all right,
you were.

1096
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:21,792
Remember when I used
to give you those bubbles baths?

1097
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,924
Vaguely.

1098
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,299
You still take baths?

1099
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,702
Mm-mm.

1100
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:30,704
Showers.

1101
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:31,705
Uh-huh.

1102
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,366
With other people?

1103
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:35,035
Sometimes lots of people.

1104
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,642
Of course, there was always
a guard watching.

1105
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,979
There's no guards here, Flynny.

1106
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,447
You never did it with Nat...

1107
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,923
Uh-oh.
Did you?

1108
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,960
Oh...

1109
00:58:52,462 --> 00:58:54,123
That was a-

1110
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,495
that was a no, right?

1111
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,227
Right.

1112
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:00,735
Though, I can't say
I didn't think about it.

1113
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:02,600
Mm.

1114
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:09,339
Just never met a man who was
so in love with his wife.

1115
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:13,780
I used to sit
on my front porch

1116
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,809
and watch them dance
in the living room.

1117
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,947
I can't say,
If thlngs weren't dlfferent,

1118
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,255
I wouldn't have...

1119
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:26,318
The man deserved
a little love and affection.

1120
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,796
Why?

1121
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:32,301
Because of the way
she treated him.

1122
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:35,269
What are you talking about?

1123
00:59:35,338 --> 00:59:36,430
He drove her away.

1124
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:37,438
He didn't drive her away.

1125
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:38,735
Yes, he dld.

1126
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:47,645
I don't know what he told you,

1127
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,685
but she left him for another man.

1128
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,088
What?

1129
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,654
That candy-ass that she
used to work for at the car dealership.

1130
00:59:57,727 --> 00:59:58,694
What, Kruger?

1131
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:05,367
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1132
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:09,462
She did not.

1133
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,200
I would've known.

1134
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:16,075
Everybody in the town knew, Flynn.

1135
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,413
Nearly broke that man in two.

1136
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:26,614
You were just a kld.

1137
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:31,752
And of course, Kruger
moved on to greener pastures.

1138
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:39,967
And, you know...

1139
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,332
She died.

1140
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:51,981
Probably shouldn't have told you.

1141
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,845
It's okay.

1142
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:57,351
I'm sorry.
Your coffee, ma'am.

1143
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:58,387
Hey.

1144
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,255
Ow!

1145
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,313
Are you all right?

1146
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:05,054
Hey, can we get
some napkins here?

1147
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:06,322
Oh.

1148
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:08,727
What happened?

1149
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:11,358
He very nearly
burned me to death.

1150
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:13,959
Please, ma'am, anything that we
can do to solve the problem,

1151
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,026
we'll be more than happy to.

1152
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:16,401
There is.

1153
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:18,133
And you will be
hearing from me.

1154
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,139
You will.

1155
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,073
And it will not be
for a refill.

1156
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,907
He saw it.
Did you see it?

1157
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:24,571
Yes, yes.

1158
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:27,341
Would you take me home?

1159
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,110
What are you, kidding?

1160
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,917
Get a lawyer.

1161
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,957
I didn't-

1162
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:41,828
So I got my Mercedes with a trip and a slip
at the supermarket last year.

1163
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:43,456
This?

1164
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,900
This ought to be worth 5 grand
and maybe a new wardrobe.

1165
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,368
Well, in that case,

1166
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:52,306
you don't mind if I ask
for my 20 dollars back, do you?

1167
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:58,513
Nat!

1168
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,741
What are you doing?

1169
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:02,717
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

1170
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:06,380
What are you doing, man?

1171
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:19,823
Guys?

1172
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,103
Sensory dep.

1173
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,507
It's so soothing.

1174
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,513
It's better
than meditating.

1175
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:33,139
Hi, baby.

1176
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,615
Wah!

1177
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:00,475
Hm.

1178
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:04,543
Hey.

1179
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:22,620
Nighty-night, Flynny.

1180
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:46,719
Comfy?

1181
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,381
Hi.

1182
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:49,424
Hey.

1183
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:57,054
I got that mattress
from that sexuaI harassment thingy,

1184
01:03:57,133 --> 01:03:58,930
from Price Breakers
last summer.

1185
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,798
A Sealy Posturepedic.

1186
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,201
The good stuff.

1187
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,102
Mm-hmm.

1188
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,043
Nice, huh?

1189
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,634
It's nice and springy.

1190
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:11,612
Yeah, it's a wonderfuI mattress.

1191
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,172
Mm-hmm.

1192
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,547
He's not here, you know?

1193
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:17,449
He's on the couch.

1194
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,147
I know.

1195
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:24,024
I know.

1196
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:26,653
Okay.

1197
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:27,753
I'm verklempt.

1198
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,627
You are one of the most exciting women

1199
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,223
I've ever been this close to,

1200
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,131
and normally, I'm a guy
who does what comes next,

1201
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,262
but in this case,
at the end of the day,

1202
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,306
it's too late.

1203
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,274
No, it's not.

1204
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,244
It is.

1205
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,404
I have an idea.

1206
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,074
How about I give you
a supply of calling cards,

1207
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:51,984
30 minutes, including
weekends and holidays?

1208
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:55,990
I already have
2,000 free minutes.

1209
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,117
Wow.

1210
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:01,254
Is this because I'm dying?

1211
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,390
This is because
you're a good man.

1212
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:05,695
I used to be.

1213
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,702
You still are.

1214
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,868
Dolores?
Yeah, baby?

1215
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,436
I would deny you nothing,

1216
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:22,416
but this is not going to happen,
I promise you.

1217
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:23,884
It's a fruitless effort.

1218
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,547
Are you giving up that easy?

1219
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,590
Oh.

1220
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,387
Oh...

1221
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,689
You think this is easy,

1222
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:35,356
for me to embarrass myself
this way?

1223
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,126
You should go.

1224
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,325
No.

1225
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,559
No.

1226
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,702
No.

1227
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:44,069
Why?

1228
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,665
The pink briefcase.

1229
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:56,078
I've never heard it spoken of
in that way before.

1230
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,349
You gave it to me
for my high schooI graduation.

1231
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,913
That was a souvenir
of friendship.

1232
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:05,427
I...
I didn't even pay for it.

1233
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:07,928
You're going
to pay for it now, buddy.

1234
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:08,929
Mm.

1235
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,556
Oh, Nat!

1236
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:13,466
Dolores.
Oh, Dolores.

1237
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:14,662
Whoa, golly.

1238
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,001
Whoa.

1239
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:19,132
Yeah.

1240
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:24,672
Boom, boom, boom,
let's go back to my room.

1241
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,278
I'll give you another try.

1242
01:06:29,352 --> 01:06:32,344
You know, don't like good-byes,
no tears, no sighs.

1243
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,552
Thank you.

1244
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,593
Mighty hunter drive?

1245
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,594
What do you say to a chow-down

1246
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:16,688
after a hard day's night?

1247
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,631
Pancakes,

1248
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,033
sausage patties,

1249
01:07:21,103 --> 01:07:22,661
maple syrup!

1250
01:07:22,738 --> 01:07:24,763
You worked up
an appetite, huh?

1251
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,808
Mm-hmm.

1252
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:45,593
How come you never
told me about Kruger?

1253
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,599
Did I tell you
he owes me $2,000?

1254
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,761
That's what I lent him
to open his first car lot,

1255
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:55,769
$2,000.

1256
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:57,100
And he stiffed me.

1257
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,665
You know how many showrooms
Kruger has as we speak?

1258
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,108
23.

1259
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,342
And still, I haven't seen
dime one of my investment.

1260
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,576
He's not an honorable man.

1261
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:12,246
No, no, Kruger and Mom,
Kruger and Mom.

1262
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:22,858
How could you not tell me?

1263
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,866
Tell you what?

1264
01:08:49,658 --> 01:08:52,058
Oh, come on.

1265
01:08:56,665 --> 01:08:57,962
Make a wish?

1266
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,601
What was yours, running naked
on the beach again?

1267
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,696
Nah.

1268
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:06,832
I already got mine.

1269
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,969
I wish you weren't sick.

1270
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,747
You on a diet?

1271
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,949
It's my cake.

1272
01:09:22,024 --> 01:09:23,753
It's for you.

1273
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,056
Thanks.

1274
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:14,572
So how you going
to stick it to him?

1275
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,372
What do you mean?

1276
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:18,072
Well, that's what
we're here for, isn't it?

1277
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,547
Get back at Kruger?

1278
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,278
How'd you put that together?

1279
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,411
I'm your son,
aren't I?

1280
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:50,810
Let me in on it.

1281
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,811
Eh.

1282
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,678
I have to do this by myself.

1283
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,411
I want to help.

1284
01:10:59,555 --> 01:11:01,989
Meet me at Dogtown, noonish.

1285
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,476
Welcome to Kruger Motors.

1286
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:25,877
Beauty, isn't she?

1287
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:29,714
4.6- liter V8 engine,
320 horses.

1288
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,877
Interested in a test drive?

1289
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,944
No, thanks.
I have a meeting with BK.

1290
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,580
Nat Flynn.

1291
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:35,589
He's very busy today.

1292
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:36,955
It could be a while.

1293
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,550
I'm early.

1294
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:41,824
Is there a place to sit,
maybe some tea?

1295
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,634
Thanks.

1296
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,507
Nat.

1297
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,741
Bert.

1298
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:03,143
Sit down.

1299
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:05,914
Thanks.

1300
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,387
Long time, no see.

1301
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,792
Not long enough.

1302
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,488
A lot of spilt milk under the bridge
for the both of us, I'm sure.

1303
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:15,530
How's your family?

1304
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:16,791
Children and your wife?

1305
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:18,127
They're great.

1306
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,600
Bert junior must be
in college by now.

1307
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:21,795
Michigan.

1308
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,497
Yeah, your alma mater.

1309
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:24,766
Kudos.

1310
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,468
Let's get down to it, Nat.

1311
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,704
Sure.

1312
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:39,213
Nice-looking boy.

1313
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:41,256
He's all rlght.

1314
01:12:41,323 --> 01:12:45,020
No chick magnet, not like us.

1315
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,895
First time they handed him
to met at the hospitaI,

1316
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,262
I got scared.

1317
01:12:51,333 --> 01:12:53,563
What am I going to do
with a screaming, red-faced kid?

1318
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:56,661
But three seconds later,
I was in love with him.

1319
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,173
I wish I hadn't felt that way.

1320
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:04,140
It should've been you, Bert.

1321
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,408
Look, Nat-

1322
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:10,441
I understand you've got
a beautifuI thing here,

1323
01:13:10,519 --> 01:13:15,183
terrific family, new career.

1324
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,725
I'm not here to upset
any of that.

1325
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,556
AII I care about is him.

1326
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,061
I want him to have something,

1327
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,654
a nest egg for when I'm gone.

1328
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,165
I haven't been able
to do that for him, but you could.

1329
01:13:27,102 --> 01:13:30,037
Or we have to do this in court.

1330
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:35,634
And then it's a public thing.

1331
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,669
How do I know
that in six months,

1332
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:40,840
you're not going to show up
on my front porch, Nat?

1333
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,784
I'm not going to be here
six months from now, Bert.

1334
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:49,813
Look, check with
my oncologist.

1335
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:50,824
His number's on the back,

1336
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,954
if you want.

1337
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,962
What about the kid?

1338
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:56,998
He doesn't know.

1339
01:13:57,065 --> 01:13:58,396
At this time of my life,

1340
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:01,368
the last thing I want is
to tell him I'm not his father.

1341
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,304
He may be a disaster,
but he's all I've got.

1342
01:14:04,373 --> 01:14:05,806
It pains me to say this,

1343
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:08,206
but there's something
wrong with him, Bert.

1344
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,041
I believe it.

1345
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,911
It's my fault.

1346
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,487
You don't look sick, Nat.

1347
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,148
You haven't
changed at all.

1348
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,386
Sam impeccable
sense of timing.

1349
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:29,693
You know today's the day I announce
my candidacy for mayor.

1350
01:14:29,765 --> 01:14:31,790
Of course,
you knew that already.

1351
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:41,676
Got us a suite.

1352
01:14:41,743 --> 01:14:43,802
You going to tell me
what happened, or what?

1353
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,973
I've thought about this day so long,
worked it out in my head,

1354
01:14:47,049 --> 01:14:48,641
and it was nothing.

1355
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,649
No big deaI.

1356
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:50,650
I talked.
He listened.

1357
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:51,743
He game me the money.

1358
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:52,809
That's it.

1359
01:14:52,888 --> 01:14:53,820
Well, that's good, right?

1360
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:54,821
You should be happy.

1361
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:56,221
You got your $2,000 back.

1362
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:58,691
My money plus 30 years
compounded interest

1363
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,126
adjusted for inflation.

1364
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,391
$150,000.

1365
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,327
What is this?

1366
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,099
You got $150,000
in a plastic-

1367
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,105
did you steaI this?

1368
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,232
He gave it to me,

1369
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:14,900
and I promise you,
he's not coming after it.

1370
01:15:14,977 --> 01:15:16,137
Why would he
give you $150,000?

1371
01:15:16,211 --> 01:15:19,044
He thinks
he's your father.

1372
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:20,342
Why does he
think he's my father?

1373
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:21,347
He took a test.

1374
01:15:21,416 --> 01:15:22,815
I sent him
his own DNA,

1375
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,375
said it was yours.

1376
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,784
Well, how'd you
get his DNA?

1377
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:27,583
Short, curly pubic hair.

1378
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:29,988
I don't know.
Ask Dolores.

1379
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,389
Oh, that's-

1380
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:33,257
that's disgusting.

1381
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,989
She's a friend.

1382
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,533
Top of the menu, right?

1383
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:52,068
What do you say
we throw the map away

1384
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:53,614
and detour down to Vegas?

1385
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:56,549
What stays there
stays there.

1386
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:57,744
Yeah, all right.

1387
01:15:57,819 --> 01:15:58,945
What's wrong,

1388
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:03,082
mopey face,
hangdog mopey face?

1389
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,001
Why would
he just roll over?

1390
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:16,299
Well, what else
was he going to do?

1391
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,360
I had him boxed in.

1392
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:19,100
He's running for mayor.

1393
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:20,664
You think his wife
and spin doctors

1394
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,710
want you
on the campaign poster?

1395
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:27,147
Thanks.

1396
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:28,978
No, it's just,
he was with Mom.

1397
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:30,780
Is that right?

1398
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:32,319
So when exactly
did that start?

1399
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:33,979
I don't know.

1400
01:16:34,056 --> 01:16:35,523
Was it before I was born?

1401
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:39,527
I try not to worry about things
I can't do anything about.

1402
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:42,557
Excuse me?

1403
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:46,192
The thing is,
we hit the jackpot, you and me.

1404
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:50,671
You play your cards right,
you never have to punch a clock.

1405
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:53,503
You can start up
something permanent with this.

1406
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:56,373
It's a nest egg.

1407
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,404
Are you shitting me?

1408
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:03,618
Are you kidding?

1409
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:04,913
I know how you feeI,

1410
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:07,683
but these last days have been
the best time for me in a long time.

1411
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,815
Oh. Oh, jeez.

1412
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,760
I wanted us to get
to know each other again, and we did.

1413
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:15,592
No, you're right.
You're right, you're right.

1414
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:16,596
I admit it.

1415
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:18,155
For some reason,
I was starting to enjoy

1416
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,860
sitting in that stupid car
with you all day.

1417
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,459
But that's worth nothing now,
because you're a liar.

1418
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:28,168
How could you think
that it wouldn't matter to me

1419
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,076
to know who my father is?

1420
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,316
Hello?

1421
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,430
Hey.

1422
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,660
Give me a straight answer.

1423
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:05,036
You're not even dying,
are you?

1424
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:08,674
The X-ray is from
a friend of mine at the zoo.

1425
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,082
It's the skull bone
of a gorilla.

1426
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,456
All right, well,
maybe you're not my father,

1427
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,755
but ever morning, I wake up,
I look in the mirror,

1428
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,919
and I feeI sick to my stomach

1429
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:22,862
because I thlnk I'm turnlng out
to be just llke you.

1430
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:34,404
Stick a knife in my heart.

1431
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:36,103
What's wrong?

1432
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:38,738
Where you going
with the money?

1433
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:43,484
What are you doing?

1434
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,898
So glve me a number.

1435
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,267
How much more
is this going to cost me?

1436
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:13,935
I don't want your money.

1437
01:20:15,877 --> 01:20:16,809
Why have you come?

1438
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:19,210
I wanted
to get a look at you.

1439
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,772
I wanted
to get a look at you too.

1440
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,543
You're not
what I expected.

1441
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:31,422
But then again, I bet Nat painted me
as the bad guy too, didn't he?

1442
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,485
Something like that.

1443
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:38,294
Look,

1444
01:20:38,366 --> 01:20:40,857
I already have a son.

1445
01:20:40,936 --> 01:20:44,235
But I might be willing to make
an arrangement with you.

1446
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,570
Not out in the open, of course.

1447
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,700
But I could get you a job in sales.

1448
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:50,972
We're opening
a new dealership in Reno.

1449
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:56,080
So you're my father.

1450
01:20:56,151 --> 01:20:59,712
I suppose we ought to get
a legitimate blood test.

1451
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:01,847
I got to assume
Nat's hustling me.

1452
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:03,185
Why'd you pay him?

1453
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,419
Guilt.

1454
01:21:05,493 --> 01:21:06,790
Pity.

1455
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,797
I wanted hlm to feel
llke he'd pulled off

1456
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,299
something big
for once in his life.

1457
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:15,393
You know,
a big score.

1458
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:23,275
Look...

1459
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,779
after the election,
you get in touch with me.

1460
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:27,781
I really have
to be getting back.

1461
01:21:27,849 --> 01:21:31,649
Okay, can I ask you a question?

1462
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:34,178
Did you love her?

1463
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:37,256
You know
what women are like.

1464
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:39,088
You say something
in the heat of the moment.

1465
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:40,422
Do you mean it?

1466
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:41,621
They think it's forever.

1467
01:21:42,797 --> 01:21:44,560
Honey?

1468
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,431
You're keeping some
very important people waiting.

1469
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,503
Can you see your way out?

1470
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,371
Saw my way in.

1471
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,246
Serlously, I wlll turn
the mlc over to Tom.

1472
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,085
Tom, what do you have to say
about Bert Kruger?

1473
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,750
He's a man of honor and Integrlty,

1474
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,690
despite being
a used car salesman.

1475
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:16,125
It would be
my honor to support him

1476
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,755
as the next mayor
of this city,

1477
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:20,164
especially if I get the discount
on that new Caddy.

1478
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:21,759
You got it, Tom.

1479
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,168
Just kidding, Bert.

1480
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:25,433
Hi, everybody.

1481
01:22:25,507 --> 01:22:26,769
I'll be reaI quick.

1482
01:22:26,841 --> 01:22:28,866
I just wanted
to say a few words

1483
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,378
about the man I've just
discovered is my father,

1484
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,209
Mr. Kruger.

1485
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,943
Dad...

1486
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:39,282
I just wanted to say how great
it is to finally meet you

1487
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:42,448
and to see what I've been
missing all this time.

1488
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:43,513
I was in jaiI.

1489
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,628
And about that $150,000
that you paid to get rid of me,

1490
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:50,687
I don't want it.

1491
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,027
I hate bribes.

1492
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,073
Hold it!

1493
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,470
Mr. Kruger, slr,
you've just been accused

1494
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:03,977
of paying hush money
to an ex-con

1495
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:04,977
who claims to be your son.

1496
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,308
Do you have any comments, sir?

1497
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:09,509
Yes, this is dirty tricks
by Terrance Bissen, my opponent.

1498
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:10,983
Is that a deniaI, sir?

1499
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,747
It's a categoricaI deniaI.

1500
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:16,257
Excuse me.
Thank you very much.

1501
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:38,570
Did you give him the money?

1502
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:44,042
How could you do that?

1503
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,143
What have you done?

1504
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,916
You gave back $150,000.

1505
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:51,015
Am I rlght?

1506
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,526
Did you give him the money?

1507
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:54,562
Yes or no?

1508
01:23:56,598 --> 01:23:58,065
Come on.

1509
01:23:58,133 --> 01:24:00,966
You ralsed me
better than that.

1510
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,743
Vegas,
here we come.

1511
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,193
Hey, Nat?

1512
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,392
How about we head down
to L.A. after?

1513
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:34,435
I want you
to meet Maggie.

1514
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,171
Nat?

1515
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:48,045
Nat?

1516
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:07,362
Hi.

1517
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:10,802
I'm in a hospitaI
in Albuquerque.

1518
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,464
It's Nat.

1519
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:15,566
And it turns out,

1520
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:20,910
this is the first time in his life
he's telling the truth.

1521
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,882
And...

1522
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,283
he's dying.

1523
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:35,724
He really is dying.

1524
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:39,198
So...

1525
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:41,201
That's...

1526
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:44,636
what I wanted to tell you.

1527
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:45,695
Bye.

1528
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:15,736
Hello?

1529
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,032
Hi.

1530
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:38,955
Could I get another tapioca, please?

1531
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,324
You've got a sweet tooth.

1532
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:42,363
I do.

1533
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,534
Closer.

1534
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:58,204
Let me feeI your face.

1535
01:27:09,257 --> 01:27:11,384
I'm sorry.

1536
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:14,858
We did good, though.

1537
01:27:14,929 --> 01:27:17,591
We got copasetic.

1538
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:19,565
We're not done yet.

1539
01:27:34,816 --> 01:27:37,614
Come here.

1540
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:40,552
Get me out of here.

1541
01:27:47,629 --> 01:27:49,358
Hi.

1542
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,407
Thanks for coming.

1543
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,312
Well, nobody ever
flew me first class before.

1544
01:28:08,416 --> 01:28:09,713
I do what I can.

1545
01:28:16,624 --> 01:28:20,492
Your mustache.

1546
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,927
You want me
to grow it back or what?

1547
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:13,474
I won this place in a card game
a long time ago.

1548
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,607
I figured,
one day, you'd come here

1549
01:29:15,683 --> 01:29:16,945
and bring the girI of your dreams,

1550
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,418
like I did.

1551
01:29:22,357 --> 01:29:23,915
Oh,

1552
01:29:23,991 --> 01:29:26,152
somebody's been here.

1553
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,692
I don't remember the place
being such a dump.

1554
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:51,876
We were a family once.

1555
01:30:09,771 --> 01:30:12,831
You wanted a boat?

1556
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,341
Thank you.

1557
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,438
Just so you know,

1558
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:23,245
if I could do it again,

1559
01:30:23,317 --> 01:30:26,377
I'd have been more like a dad,

1560
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:30,720
tossed a ball, pitched a tent,

1561
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:32,384
taught you to drive.

1562
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:35,793
You did teach me to drive.

1563
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:36,887
Come on.
Uncle Al-

1564
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:38,864
No, you did. You did.

1565
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:45,600
In the parking lot behind
St. PauI's Church when I was 11.

1566
01:30:45,673 --> 01:30:48,471
You're right.

1567
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:51,068
How could I do
a thing like that?

1568
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:00,119
Come on.

1569
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:01,587
There's something
we got to do.

1570
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:45,095
Well, I spent my whole life

1571
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,134
wanting a different kind of a father,

1572
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:54,767
one who would look after me
instead of me looking after him.

1573
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:57,106
And instead,

1574
01:31:57,178 --> 01:32:03,048
I got this infantile,
irresponsible,

1575
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:11,684
uncivilized, cheap,
jive-talking bullshit artist.

1576
01:32:11,759 --> 01:32:15,752
And now that
I'm rid of you,

1577
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:18,025
here...

1578
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:28,697
Here I am
wanting you back.

1579
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:29,800
It's typicaI.

1580
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:32,771
Oh, and you'd be

1581
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:36,044
happy to know that urn was free
with $5 of gas.

1582
01:32:42,957 --> 01:32:45,084
I'm gonna miss you, Dad.

1583
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:06,341
We're sinking.

1584
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,972
Oh, come on.

1585
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:09,016
What do we do?

1586
01:33:09,183 --> 01:33:10,707
What do we do?

1587
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:13,879
Hey, grab that metaI cup
right there.

1588
01:33:13,955 --> 01:33:15,013
It's coming in fast.

1589
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:17,717
BaiI, baiI,
baiI, baiI!

1590
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:18,724
Why don't you row?

1591
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:20,761
BaiI!

1592
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:23,319
You got to be shitting me, Nat!

1593
01:33:23,397 --> 01:33:24,364
Row!

1594
01:33:26,434 --> 01:33:27,366
Oh, what did I do?

1595
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,459
Oh, my God.

1596
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:29,935
Help!

1597
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:31,130
Help!

1598
01:33:31,205 --> 01:33:32,137
It's not funny.

1599
01:33:32,206 --> 01:33:34,071
Ah!

1600
01:33:42,083 --> 01:33:46,247
# And if I had the time to solve
the mystery of your crime, #

1601
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:51,223
# you know I would #

1602
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:55,422
# If I had to shape the form
of your mechanicaI design, #

1603
01:33:55,496 --> 01:34:00,399
# you know I could #

1604
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,232
# But I've been up and down
the lanes to lose #

1605
01:34:03,304 --> 01:34:05,534
# the memory of your name,
the sword #

1606
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:08,074
# taken from this stone #

1607
01:34:08,142 --> 01:34:09,769
# Put it in the lake #

1608
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:12,142
# But I mended up
my heart #

1609
01:34:12,213 --> 01:34:19,346
# and I have nothing more
than bones to break #

1610
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,785
# But I said #

1611
01:34:20,855 --> 01:34:23,949
# I do believe #

1612
01:34:24,025 --> 01:34:28,894
# on the endless roads
you weave #

1613
01:34:28,963 --> 01:34:30,954
# You may climb #

1614
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:33,523
# You may fall #

1615
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:40,336
# You could spend your lifetime
on the wall #

1616
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:42,103
# I don't mind #

1617
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:54,181
# If I had the hand to take
the blood out of the sand #

1618
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:59,693
# or make it dry #

1619
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:03,924
# And if I knew about
all the secrets of the earth #

1620
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:08,594
# I won't ask why #

1621
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:11,297
# Well, I've been
in and out of windows #

1622
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,704
# just trying
to find a doorway #

1623
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:16,174
# I've broken off the marble #

1624
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:18,006
# that has
weighed upon my shoes #

1625
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:20,513
# But I mended up my heart #

1626
01:35:20,581 --> 01:35:24,608
# and I've nothing
more than time to lose #

1627
01:35:27,755 --> 01:35:29,086
# But I said #

1628
01:35:29,156 --> 01:35:32,182
# I do believe #

1629
01:35:32,259 --> 01:35:37,026
# on the endless roads
you weave #

1630
01:35:37,098 --> 01:35:39,191
# You may climb #

1631
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:41,734
# You may fall #

1632
01:35:41,802 --> 01:35:48,640
# You could spend your lifetime
on the wall #

1633
01:35:48,709 --> 01:35:50,233
# I don't mind #

1634
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:09,793
# If I could look within #

1635
01:36:09,864 --> 01:36:12,025
# the endless tales
upon your skin #

1636
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:17,628
# would I go blind? #

1637
01:36:17,705 --> 01:36:21,266
# If I could carve your face
upon an unfamiliar place #

1638
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:26,177
# would I be kind? #

1639
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:28,442
# But I've seen visions
of a ghost #

1640
01:36:28,516 --> 01:36:31,747
# that stand upon
the record sleeve #

1641
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:33,047
# of all my faded dreams #

1642
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,520
# that I've broken
at the seams #

1643
01:36:35,589 --> 01:36:37,921
# But I mended up
my heart #

1644
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:45,398
# and I've nothing more
than sorrow on the brain #

1645
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:46,797
# But said #

1646
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,768
# that I do believe #

1647
01:36:49,837 --> 01:36:54,774
# on the endless roads
you weave #

1648
01:36:54,842 --> 01:36:57,106
# You may climb #

1649
01:36:57,178 --> 01:36:59,738
# You may fall #

1650
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:06,242
# Spend your lifetime
on the wall #

1651
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:08,379
# But I don't mind #

1652
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:10,514
# I don't mind #

1653
01:37:10,724 --> 01:37:12,919
# I don't mind #

1654
01:37:13,127 --> 01:37:15,152
# I don't mind #

1655
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,523
# I don't mind #

1656
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:19,926
# I don't mind #

1657
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:22,568
# I don't mind #

1658
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:27,764
# Don't mind #

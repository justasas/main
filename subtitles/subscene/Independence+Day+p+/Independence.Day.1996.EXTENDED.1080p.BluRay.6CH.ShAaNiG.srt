1
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:10,696
<i>For those who haven't
read the plaque, we'll read the plaque.</i>

2
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:15,663
<i>"Here men from the planet Earth
first set foot upon the moon."</i>

3
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,504
<i>"July 1969."</i>

4
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,549
<i>"We came in peace for all mankind."</i>

5
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,312
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

6
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,776
Sir, I-I think you should listen to this.

7
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,779
Agh!

8
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,082
<i>- Goddamn it!
- Sir?</i>

9
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,242
Sir?

10
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,962
Come on, baby,
come on, baby, come on!

11
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,749
This better not be
another damn Russian spy job!

12
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,134
Boys at air traffic say
the skies are clear.

13
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,044
It's the real thing.

14
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,213
A radio signal from another world.

15
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,848
Let's not jump the gun here.

16
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,135
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...

17
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,145
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

18
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,897
Wait, this can't be right.

19
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,726
The calculated distance from source...

20
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,112
...is only 375,000km.

21
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,992
It's coming from the moon.

22
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,571
Who else knows about this?

23
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,964
S.E.T.I. in New Mexico
identified a signal.

24
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:14,756
But, uh... they're even more
confused than we are, sir.

25
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,179
Excuse me.

26
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,812
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,973
Radar reception has been impaired...

28
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,188
...but we were able to get these.

29
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:31,864
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km...

30
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,617
...and a mass roughly
one fourth the size of our moon.

31
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,323
What the hell is it?

32
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,488
- A meteor?
- No, sir.

33
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,157
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?

34
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,543
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

35
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,795
- It's what?
- It's, uh...

36
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,297
It's slowing down, sir.

37
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,099
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

38
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,347
Then wake him!

39
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,724
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

40
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,359
<i>- It's me.
- Hi.</i>

41
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,522
<i>- What time is it there?
- It's 2:45 in the morning.</i>

42
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,783
- <i>I know I didn't wake you.</i>
- <i>As</i> a <i>matter of fact, you did.</i>

43
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,614
Liar.

44
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,451
I have a confession to make.

45
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,244
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

46
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,583
<i>You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?</i>

47
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,750
<i>- Did you?
- Of course not.</i>

48
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:35,544
- You're coming home after the luncheon?
- <i>Yes, yes.</i>

49
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,259
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

50
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,261
- <i>Hi, honey!</i>
- <i>Hi,</i> I <i>miss you.</i>

51
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:49,524
<i>President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40 percent.</i>

52
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,276
He's good.

53
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,029
<i>Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?</i>

54
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,113
<i>Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from leadership in politics.</i>

55
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,153
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

56
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,199
- <i>Traitor.</i>
- <i>They elected</i> a <i>warrior and got</i> a <i>wimp.</i>

57
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,457
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr. President.

58
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,213
That game couldn't have been pretty.

59
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,919
Thank you, sir.

60
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,712
Connie, you're up awfully
early this morning.

61
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,884
They're not attacking your policies.
They're attacking your age.

62
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,427
"Whitmore seems less like the president...

63
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:31,101
“and more like the orphaned child Oliver
asking, 'Please, sir, I'd like some more."'

64
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,644
- That's clever.
- Well, I'm not laughing.

65
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,313
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

66
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,823
You were thought of as young, idealistic...

67
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,656
Now... the message has gotten lost.

68
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,822
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

69
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:49,209
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

70
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:57,584
It's a fine line between standing
behind a principle and hiding behind one.

71
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,845
You can tolerate a little compromise...

72
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:03,348
...if you're actually managing
to get something accomplished.

73
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,179
Well...

74
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:11,099
The Orange <i>County Dispatch</i> has voted you
one of the 10 sexiest men of the year.

75
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,606
That's...

76
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,114
That's accomplishing something!

77
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,072
Mr. President, it's the
secretary of defense.

78
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,788
Yes.

79
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,456
Could... you say that again?

80
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,122
<i>Temperature is
95° in Central Park...</i>

81
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,035
<i>Let's go to Nick Jones and get us a
travel report for the beaches...</i>

82
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,583
So why are you waiting, hmm?

83
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,090
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

84
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,962
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

85
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,730
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

86
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,391
If you don't move soon,
I'll start to decompose.

87
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,397
Ah!

88
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,732
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

89
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,493
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.

90
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,250
It's been... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

91
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,537
- Three years.
- All right, three... four.

92
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,126
You're divorced, move on.
This is not healthy.

93
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,384
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

94
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,182
- Checkmate.
- Wait a minute.

95
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,013
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

96
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,680
- Wait a minute. This is not Checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

97
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:16,940
Just hold on! This is not Checkmate.

98
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,482
Oh... Checkmate!

99
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,857
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

100
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,152
Yeah, I love <i>X-Files,</i> too.
I hope you get to see it.

101
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,074
David! David!

102
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,036
What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?

103
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,201
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.

104
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,461
What's the... What's the big emergency?

105
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,375
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

106
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,168
We got static, snow, all
kinds of distortions.

107
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:46,803
- Marty.
- Nobody knows...

108
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,714
There's a reason
we have bins labeled "Recycle"!

109
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,600
What the hell is going on?
My God in heaven!

110
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,854
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

111
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,980
Did you switch transponder channels?

112
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,234
Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?

113
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,861
Okay, let's point the dish
at another satellite.

114
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,527
We tried that. It didn't work.

115
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,908
It's almost as though they weren't there.

116
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,365
All right. What have we got here?

117
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,914
This is impossible.

118
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,921
<i>We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...</i>

119
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,074
The signal's all screwed up.

120
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:27,428
Stop it! Just leave it alone.
You'll break it!

121
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,758
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

122
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,184
Oh, no.

123
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,853
Good morning, Lucas.

124
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,899
You see these?
I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

125
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,909
If your father's not in
the air in 20 minutes...

126
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,996
...I'm getting someone else.

127
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,087
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

128
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,345
Agh!

129
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,595
Whoo!

130
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,179
Ya-hoo!

131
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,723
Russell! What are you doing?

132
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,703
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

133
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,368
Whoa!

134
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,834
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

135
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,250
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

136
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,888
Are you sure?

137
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,014
CNS is running a story that we're
covering up a nuclear-testing experiment.

138
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,891
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.

139
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,052
NASA wants to know our position.

140
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,221
Our official position is...

141
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,265
...we have no official position.

142
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,229
- Connie!
- What is going on here?

143
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,394
Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

144
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,062
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

145
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,902
What? I can't hear you.

146
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:55,908
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

147
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:59,037
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

148
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,197
What if it doesn't pass us by?

149
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,742
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?

150
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,502
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

151
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:10,416
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

152
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,755
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

153
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,091
But that's not gonna keep.

154
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,098
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

155
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:23,888
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the president said.

156
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,930
Isn't that a little premature?

157
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,725
We have over 50 percent of the armed forces
on weekend leave.

158
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,612
Plus the commanders and troops that are
in town for the Fourth of July parade.

159
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,491
The object has settled
into a stationary orbit.

160
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,529
- Well, that's good news.
- Uh, not really, sir.

161
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,405
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

162
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,246
Smaller than the whole, sir...

163
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,911
...yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

164
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,590
Where are they heading?

165
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:56,094
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

166
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,389
Take us to DEFCON 3.

167
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,402
- Please say we're getting somewhere.
- There's good news and bad news.

168
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,298
All right. What's
the bad news?

169
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,617
There's a penalty for
disturbing my lunch.

170
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,782
And the good news is you won't charge me.

171
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,701
No. The good news is that
the problem is not our equipment.

172
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,417
It's some weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

173
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,502
And that's the good news?

174
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,921
Yeah. This signal has a sequential pattern,
so once I find the exact binary sequence...

175
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,465
...I can calculate the phase reversal
and apply it.

176
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,725
We should be able to block it out.

177
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,020
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!

178
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,149
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, David! That's why I love you!

179
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,434
Oh! That's not necessary.

180
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,353
Too kind.

181
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,009
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

182
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,267
Sir, we're looking at a total
radar blackout over a 13km area.

183
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,777
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

184
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,985
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

185
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,953
Jeez!

186
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,124
Get me Atlantic Command.

187
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,495
Hang on, sir.

188
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:58,132
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

189
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,266
Second sighting?

190
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,966
Yes, sir. Just came in
from the Persian Gulf.

191
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,880
Correction, sir.

192
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,140
<i>We have two confirmed visual contacts.</i>

193
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,645
Mr. President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

194
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,852
All right, put it on.
General, you might wanna watch this.

195
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,565
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we are
interrupting our regular broadcast...</i>

196
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:25,326
<i>...to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>

197
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,456
<i>This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.</i>

198
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,618
<i>How would you describe
what you are seeing?</i>

199
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,753
<i>It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly...</i>

200
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,085
<i>...to be a comet or meteor.</i>

201
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:41,797
<i>Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside...</i>

202
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,462
<i>...as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>

203
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:49,009
<i>It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.</i>

204
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,553
Mr. President,
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.

205
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,222
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

206
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,943
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

207
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,604
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

208
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:05,776
Negative. We have zero visibility.
Visibility is at zero.

209
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,321
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

210
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,617
Captain, the president is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

211
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,961
<i>We still have zero visibility.</i>

212
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,169
<i>Instrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>

213
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,045
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
on what's in front of us.</i>

214
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,212
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

215
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,553
<i>It may be clearing.</i>

216
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,766
Pull out!

217
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,580
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

218
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,991
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

219
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,330
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

220
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,245
Alex, organize a military escort.

221
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,336
Mr. President, I recommend
we move you to a secure location.

222
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,719
- Connie, can we expect the same panic?
- More than likely.

223
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,847
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.

224
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,351
We have to maintain a working government.

225
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:18,390
Take the vice president, the whole cabinet,
and the joint chiefs to a secured location.

226
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:19,682
I'm staying.

227
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,774
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

228
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,566
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

229
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,734
We'll advise people not to panic.

230
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,949
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

231
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,910
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

232
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,872
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

233
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,006
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

234
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,293
I had a feeling you would.

235
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,553
And what happens
if they do become hostile?

236
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,807
Then God help us.

237
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,563
<i>There it is.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>

238
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,896
<i>It is apparently what is causing
all the distortions...</i>

239
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,360
David, are you watching this?

240
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:14,325
<i>There is no evidence that
these phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>

241
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,660
<i>Thus far, reports of oppression...</i>

242
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:21,331
Marty, listen to this. I got a lock on that
signal pattern so we can filter it out.

243
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,839
But if my calculations are right,
it'll be gone in seven hours.

244
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,500
It's reducing itself every
time it recycles...

245
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,637
...so eventually it'll disappear...

246
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,218
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

247
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,519
David, haven't you been watching? David!

248
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:45,151
<i>Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.</i>

249
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,439
We have to ask you to stay calm, and it's
important for everyone not to panic.

250
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,030
<i>We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...</i>

251
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,036
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

252
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,789
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles...</i>

253
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:04,045
<i>...the other two are headed towards
New York and Washington, DC.</i>

254
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,003
Marty. Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

255
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,042
We're heading down there now.

256
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,053
Okay, everybody! Head down to the basement.

257
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,637
Take it slow, don't run.
Walk down to the basement!

258
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,891
There's no shame in hiding.

259
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,147
Oh, I'd better call my mother.

260
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,244
Well, look who we have here.

261
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,584
Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

262
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,791
Dusted the wrong field.

263
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:51,255
I know you're probably still a little
confused from your hostage experience.

264
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:55,172
Hostage experience?
Did something happen to you, Russ?

265
00:20:55,337 --> 00:21:00,594
Years back, he was kidnapped by aliens. Did
all kind of experiments on him and such.

266
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,936
Tell them about it, Russ. Get a few beers
in him and he'll tell you all about it.

267
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,940
Won't you, Russ?

268
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,149
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

269
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:13,614
...sexual things?

270
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,697
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

271
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,473
Well, wake up!

272
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,521
What's happening?
What's going on?

273
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,102
- What's that?
- Let's get out of here, come on!

274
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,362
Wow!

275
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:14,751
Mommy, look it!

276
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,014
It's too early, baby.

277
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,476
Is it an earthquake?

278
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,516
Not even a four-pointer.

279
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,731
Go back to sleep.

280
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,127
Daddy!

281
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,919
What are you doing here?

282
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,381
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?

283
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,379
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

284
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,310
Oh, man! What is that?

285
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,587
The signal!

286
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,046
My God!

287
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,781
Now what do we do?

288
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,283
Address the nation.

289
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,195
There's gonna be
a lot of frightened people out there.

290
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,863
Yeah.

291
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,998
I'm one of them.

292
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,578
', hey, hey! Come on!

293
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,713
He's just trying to impress you.

294
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,625
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job...

295
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,169
...and stop slobbering all over my shoes.

296
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,608
I don't believe this. Jasmine!

297
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:07,821
Neighbors are moving out. I guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

298
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,204
A little shake and they running.

299
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,166
<i>Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.</i>

300
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,874
There's something on the news
about the quake!

301
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,207
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.

302
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,673
- What you doing going out there?
- Shooting aliens.

303
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,509
Oh, you shooting aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?

304
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,594
What you got? Turn around.

305
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,930
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

306
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,268
Watch out! Watch it now!

307
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,683
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.

308
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,320
Ow! Dylan!

309
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,581
Come on, honey, let's go!

310
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,598
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

311
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,938
Babe?

312
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,609
Boom! Boom! Boom!

313
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,279
<i>Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived...</i>

314
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,819
<i>...over the capitals
of India, England, and Germany...</i>

315
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,661
<i>...bringing estimates up to between 10
and 15 of these city-size spacecraft.</i>

316
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,451
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

317
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,494
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

318
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,005
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!

319
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,416
Ma! Ma, listen!

320
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,007
Uh... Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

321
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,171
Don't argue with me! Just go!

322
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,762
David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

323
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,801
David! David, talk to me.

324
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,097
Didn't you hear me say that
the signal in the satellite feed...

325
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,186
...is recycling down to extinction?

326
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,146
- Not really.
- Countdown.

327
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,529
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?

328
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,867
It's like in chess. First you
strategically position your pieces.

329
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:18,122
Then, when the timing's right,
you... strike. See?

330
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,874
They're positioning themselves
all over the world...

331
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,536
...using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

332
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,957
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

333
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,625
And then what?

334
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,675
Checkmate.

335
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,058
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

336
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,060
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

337
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,972
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!

338
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,890
Ah, forget my lawyer.

339
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:48,311
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.</i>

340
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:50,400
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

341
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,530
<i>My fellow Americans...</i>

342
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,989
<i>...a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.</i>

343
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,200
<i>The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe...</i>

344
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,240
...has been answered.

345
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:05,707
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear...

346
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,588
...we must attempt to reserve judgment.

347
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,250
He says he's your husband.

348
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,386
Oh, God...

349
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,342
- What do you want?
- You gotta leave the White House.

350
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,853
This is hardly the time
to be having that old discussion.

351
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,433
You gotta leave Washington.

352
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:28,226
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!

353
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:31,066
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.

354
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,697
- You are just being paranoid!
- <i>It's</i> not paranoia!

355
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:36,529
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...

356
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,748
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

357
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,413
- Please?
- Okay.

358
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:52,708
<i>The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.</i>

359
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,632
<i>If you feel compelled to
leave these cities...</i>

360
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,139
<i>...please do so in an orderly fashion.</i>

361
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,566
Excuse me! Coming through.

362
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,811
<i>The arrival of the aliens has caused...</i>

363
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,652
<i>...over 10,000 fender benders
in just a few seconds.</i>

364
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,613
<i>But this is just the beginning...</i>

365
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:23,406
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

366
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,997
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

367
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,582
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

368
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,048
Look, why are you acting like this?

369
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,463
Why?

370
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,509
That's why!

371
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,859
Look... I really don't think...

372
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:55,271
...they flew go billion light years
to come and start a fight...

373
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,319
...and get all rowdy.

374
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,325
Look, why don't you just relax?

375
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:03,454
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's going on.

376
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:11,712
- What are you doing in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just driving.

377
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,831
Look.

378
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,544
Hey, I got these for you.

379
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,334
- Firecrackers!
- You be careful.

380
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,673
Steve, wait.

381
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:22,135
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

382
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,723
You take care of yourself, you hear?

383
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,687
Look, um...

384
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,854
Why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

385
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,737
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

386
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,823
Really?

387
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,824
You don't mind?

388
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,868
Well, I mean...

389
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,580
I will have to let
all my other girlfriends know...

390
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,666
...they can't come over.
I got to postpone the freaky deaky.

391
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:57,333
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

392
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,844
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

393
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,929
Yes, I am.

394
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,428
Them big old Dumbo ears.

395
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,558
Look at you with them chicken legs.

396
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,982
Come on, Dylan.

397
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,909
Look out!

398
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,501
Hey! Whoa!

399
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,584
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.

400
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,795
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?

401
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,711
- David, you don't have a license.
- You're driving.

402
00:32:42,878 --> 00:32:45,722
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!

403
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,051
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

404
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,641
You're staying there to keep people calm.

405
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,023
I won't let them criticize you for it.

406
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,327
I appreciate your
trying to help me.

407
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:59,938
Liar. Stick to the truth.
You're good at it.

408
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,481
Okay. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.

409
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,117
I'll leave
as soon as the interviews are done.

410
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:10,156
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're taking you to Nellis.

411
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,666
- <i>And the</i> munchkin?
- She'll meet you there.

412
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,828
All right. I love you.

413
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,753
I love you.

414
00:33:17,913 --> 00:33:20,962
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

415
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,172
<i>It's the</i> White <i>House!</i>

416
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:30,513
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this go any faster?

417
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,680
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! She works for the president.

418
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,474
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.

419
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,190
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So are you so smart?

420
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,481
How come you spent eight years
in MIT to become a cable repairman?

421
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:44,773
Dad...

422
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,443
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.

423
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,532
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

424
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,163
Look at these people, look. Huh?

425
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,370
Vultures. They take and then they go.

426
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,707
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane!

427
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,622
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!

428
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,191
They're getting in front.
I can't go faster.

429
00:34:03,203 --> 00:34:04,384
I don't wanna argue.

430
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,716
Let's just get there as
quickly as possible.

431
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:10,928
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

432
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,888
<i>A crop-duster was arrested
as he dropped leaflets from the air.</i>

433
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:19,103
<i>- Everybody's leaving.
- Can you give us some of your time?</i>

434
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:23,396
<i>We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!</i>

435
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,610
<i>They did all kinds of experiments on me!</i>

436
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,821
<i>They've been studying us,
finding out our weaknesses!</i>

437
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,158
<i>We've gotta stop them.
They're gonna kill us all!</i>

438
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,496
<i>Some people attribute
his behavior to post-traumatic stress...</i>

439
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,831
<i>...from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.</i>

440
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,417
<i>Others have a more unusual theory.</i>

441
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,332
<i>How would you describe Mr. Casse?</i>

442
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,047
<i>- Keeps to himself. Quiet.
- Private.</i>

443
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,553
<i>When they took him up in the spaceship...</i>

444
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,261
<i>...the aliens abused him...</i>

445
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,429
<i>...sexually.</i>

446
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,640
<i>Mr. Casse is in the county lockup...</i>

447
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,850
Pack up. We're leaving.

448
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,017
<i>He may be released later tonight...</i>

449
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,277
Miguel, what about Dad?

450
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,322
This could be our last night on Earth.

451
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,908
You don't wanna die a virgin... do you?

452
00:35:12,986 --> 00:35:15,614
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

453
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,157
Miguel!

454
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:18,871
Stop it!

455
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,711
Thanks a lot, partner!

456
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,502
You read my mind!

457
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,592
Stay here.

458
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,474
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

459
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,639
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

460
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,806
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

461
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,599
Come on, boy!

462
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,860
We're leaving... without you.

463
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,404
We're going to live with
Uncle Hector in Tucson.

464
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,657
<i>Pss...</i>

465
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,450
Hector!

466
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,704
Like hell you are! I'm still your father.

467
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,739
No, you're not.

468
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,250
You're just the man who married my mother.

469
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,376
You're nothing to me!

470
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,412
Oh...

471
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,962
Oh!

472
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,798
Well, what about Troy?

473
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,883
- Troy?
- Yeah.

474
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,767
For once in your life, why don't you
think about what's best for him?

475
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,020
Who has to beg for money to buy him
medicine when you screw up? Huh?

476
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,431
Who? Who?!

477
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,974
You stop it right now!

478
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,985
I'm not a baby anymore!

479
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:31,523
I don't want your stupid medicine,
because I'm so sick of medicine!

480
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,318
Do you know what this stuff costs?

481
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,452
Do you wanna get sick again?

482
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,122
Do you?

483
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:44,503
<i>The L.A.P.D. is asking Los Angelenos not to
fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.</i>

484
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,048
<i>You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.</i>

485
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,302
Do you think we can find something better
to do with our time?

486
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,178
Where you been, Stevie?

487
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,681
Man, this is unbelievable.
This is, like, huge.

488
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,437
- They've recalled everybody.
- Looks like the mall's still working.

489
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,019
Oh! Oh, Oh...

490
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,151
Uh... You'll have to
do the honors for me, man.

491
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,903
- You're a wuss!
- Whatever. Shut up and read it.

492
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,074
It says... "Captain Steven Hiller"...

493
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,450
...loser.

494
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,078
- Come on, come on!
- Blah, blah, blah, blah!

495
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,990
"We regret to inform you that...

496
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,956
...despite your excellent
record of service..."

497
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,797
I'm sorry, man.

498
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,458
You know what you need to do?

499
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,299
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world.

500
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,464
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

501
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,632
See, I like the one-knee approach..

502
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:43,804
...because it puts the booty,
like, right in front of the lip...

503
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,519
- What's this?
- That's nothing.

504
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:47,682
What is this?

505
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,069
Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins.

506
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,026
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

507
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,371
I thought you said
you were gonna break it all off?

508
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,372
Yes...

509
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,420
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

510
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,672
You know that, right?

511
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:17,258
Man, you're never gonna get to fly
the space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

512
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>It could only happen in California.
Here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.</i>

513
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,771
<i>Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered
on rooftops in Los Angeles...</i>

514
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,860
<i>...to welcome the new arrivals.</i>

515
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,400
<i>Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!</i>

516
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,571
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

517
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,705
Oh, I must have been tripping.

518
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,787
<i>It's the party event of the century!</i>

519
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,453
<i>Everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.</i>

520
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,418
- This is so cool!
- Girl, please!

521
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,505
Oh, hey!
I made it before I came in tonight.

522
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,799
Check it out!

523
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,216
Now, I know you're not
thinking about joining those idiots.

524
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,475
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

525
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,553
- Do you wanna come?
- Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

526
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,605
I've got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

527
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,896
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got
when I went to Las Vegas?

528
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:20,283
Yeah. And I was right. You didn't get the
job and you lost all your money gambling.

529
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,536
Yeah, but I wasn't in L.A.
for the earthquake.

530
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:26,952
Tiff, I really don't
want you to go up there.

531
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,459
- Now promise me you won't.
- Oh!

532
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,711
Come on, girl! Promise me.

533
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,669
I promise.

534
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:36,962
Okay.

535
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:39,131
Look...

536
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:42,798
I'm going. I'm out of town for a while.

537
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:44,887
- Later.
- Bye.

538
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,769
Hey, there's my angel. Come on.

539
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,975
Come on, Boomer. Let's go.

540
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,890
Hey, talk to your boyfriend later.

541
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,151
Hey! What the hell's the kid doing here?
Huh? Get out of here!

542
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,234
- You try finding a sitter today.
- Hey! Where are you going?

543
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,242
- You leave... you're fired.
- Nice working with you, Mario.

544
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,990
Come on, Boomer.

545
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,727
Everyone is trying to
get out of Washington.

546
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:14,914
We're the only schmucks
trying to get in.

547
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,758
What the hell is that?

548
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,550
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

549
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,511
You think an important person
like Constance will be listed?

550
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,722
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

551
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:32,139
Sometimes it's her first initial,
sometimes her nickname...

552
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,184
- Sometimes just her...
- Oy, my God!

553
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,273
Hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

554
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,611
- Pit stops!
- Tell them!

555
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,909
Slow down!

556
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,863
Off-ramp!

557
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,578
Slow down!

558
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,461
- Oh! We made it! We made it!
- Good.

559
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,583
Nice driving, Pops.

560
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,546
Well...

561
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,716
So, not listed, huh?

562
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,637
No, no. I just haven't
found it yet. Um...

563
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,520
I tried C. Spano, Connie Spano...
Spunky... Spano...

564
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,804
Spunky?

565
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,937
- College nickname.
- Uh-huh. Cute.

566
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,896
- You tried Levinson?
- She didn't take my name.

567
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,149
Why would she...? What
are you talking about?

568
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:23,861
Try it.

569
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,742
Okay. Here. Look.

570
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,328
So, what do I know? Hmm?

571
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,966
So?

572
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,427
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should I?

573
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,100
- Oh, perfect, she's using it.
- What? It's busy?

574
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:59,484
Yeah, I can use her signal to triangulate
her exact position in the White House.

575
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,111
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

576
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,023
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

577
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,525
Take care.

578
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,693
<i>The president
remains at the White House.</i>

579
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,409
<i>Question. Are Mr. Whitmore's actions...</i>

580
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:13,573
<i>...ultra brave...</i>

581
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,209
<i>...foolhardy?</i>

582
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,954
- What?
<i>- Don't hang up, sweetie.</i>

583
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,373
David! How did you get this number?

584
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,794
- Do me a favor. Walk to <i>the window.</i>
- And I'm looking for what?

585
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,837
<i>You'll see.</i>

586
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,972
Over here.

587
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:33,260
<i>See us?</i>

588
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:35,303
How does he do that?

589
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:47,900
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors...

590
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,411
...Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter...

591
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,913
...with a visual communications device.

592
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,168
- Mr. President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

593
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:01,000
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing liftoff.

594
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,915
<i>...and refitted
with these enormous light panels...</i>

595
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:06,585
<i>...that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.</i>

596
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,970
<i>Echo One,
Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>

597
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,176
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

598
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,684
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.</i>

599
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,516
This is something I would never believe
that I would be!

600
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,726
In the White House! Look at this!

601
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,480
If I knew I was gonna meet the president,
I would have worn a tie.

602
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,691
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

603
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,105
You look fine, Pops.

604
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,027
Oy, my God!

605
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,878
David, I don't know if
he'll want to see you.

606
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:34,196
Then we're wasting
time, we should go.

607
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:37,536
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

608
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,201
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

609
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,621
- The president!
- He wasn't president then.

610
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,336
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!

611
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,421
A fight that you started!

612
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,426
David thought I was having an affair.

613
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,508
- With the president?
- Which I wasn't!

614
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,969
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

615
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,532
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

616
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,096
You punched the president?

617
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,389
God!

618
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:11,399
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

619
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:12,777
- We're <i>closing in.</i>

620
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:15,491
<i>- Roger that. Begin
sequence when ready.</i>

621
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,916
This I like.

622
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,915
Look at this!

623
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,546
You know what famous people
have been here? Hmm?

624
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:26,705
Yes, Dad.

625
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,749
Politicians... Actors...

626
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,964
Baseball players, singers...

627
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,004
And now me!

628
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,632
Imagine that! "A poor immigrant like me..."

629
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,800
- "It's a dream!"
- Shh! David, please!

630
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,395
<i>The three choppers are approaching...</i>

631
00:44:40,553 --> 00:44:45,434
<i>...what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...</i>

632
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,103
You're leaving now?

633
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:51,357
See if they've got those
pens they give away.

634
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,069
Dad, what?

635
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,618
I don't have a choice...

636
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,198
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

637
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,991
Mr. President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

638
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,378
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

639
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,085
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

640
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,719
Uh... I know why we have
satellite disruption.

641
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,719
All right. Go ahead.

642
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,472
Okay.

643
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:23,430
Let's say that you wanted
to coordinate with

644
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:26,187
spaceships on different
sides of the Earth.

645
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,693
They couldn't send a direct signal, right?

646
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,224
You mean line of sight?

647
00:45:31,236 --> 00:45:33,860
Right. The curve of
the Earth prevents it.

648
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:38,369
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

649
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,747
Well, I found a signal hidden inside...

650
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,826
...our own satellite system.

651
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,165
Excuse me, Mr. President. They're starting.

652
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,594
They're using our own
satellites against us.

653
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:00,599
The clock is ticking.

654
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,356
<i>- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon...</i>

655
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,938
<i>...Echo One. Approaching alien ship.</i>

656
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,775
Initiating communication sequence.

657
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,817
<i>Welcome Wagon has commenced.</i>

658
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:26,125
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.

659
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:28,781
Tell them to evacuate
people from the cities.

660
00:46:28,793 --> 00:46:29,629
Yes, sir.

661
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,791
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

662
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,130
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

663
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,590
Kim! My daughter.

664
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,590
Uh... There's something happening here.

665
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,228
They're responding.

666
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,139
<i>Something is happening.</i>

667
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,858
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.

668
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,115
<i>We see it, too. Can't identify it.</i>

669
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,881
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

670
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,885
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

671
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,260
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

672
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,179
Nice. Very nice.

673
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,720
Good! Close the door! Hatch secure!

674
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,438
We have our own phone.

675
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,022
Move out of here.

676
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,191
The president's ordered an evacuation.

677
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,110
<i>Our prayers go out to the pilots' families.</i>

678
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,654
<i>- Indeed, God help us all.
- Mrs. Whitmore.</i>

679
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,414
<i>The visitors responded with terrifying...</i>

680
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:51,419
<i>Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.</i>

681
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,877
<i>People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.</i>

682
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,087
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me.

683
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:06,142
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

684
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:11,022
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

685
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,578
- Can we move it along?
- Dr. Katz's office.

686
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,960
- Hello. Dr. Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

687
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,589
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

688
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,892
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

689
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:51,812
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

690
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,025
Mrs. Whitmore!

691
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,357
<i>You must leave now.</i>

692
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,896
No!

693
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,611
The First Lady's secured.
We're on the move.

694
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,880
They're opening UP!

695
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,682
It's so pretty.

696
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,290
Get the hell out of here!

697
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,186
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

698
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,602
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

699
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,736
Here.

700
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,922
Time's up.

701
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,651
Oh, crap.

702
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,121
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

703
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,373
Come on, Boomer!

704
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,293
Boomer!

705
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,631
Boomer!

706
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,034
<i>Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation...</i>

707
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,579
<i>...but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.</i>

708
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,918
Good God!

709
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,548
I've been saying it.

710
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:57,337
I've been saying it for ten damn years!
Ain't I, Miguel?

711
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,551
Huh? I've been saying it!

712
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,891
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.

713
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:04,302
Pull it over, man.

714
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:16,697
- We're gonna be all right, Troy.
- Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

715
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,161
Miguel!

716
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:24,993
Look at all that.

717
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,606
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

718
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,069
That's the advantage of
being a fighter pilot.

719
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,899
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

720
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,111
This is just...

721
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,372
...not simple any more.

722
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:10,376
A lot of people died today.

723
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,545
How many didn't have to?

724
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,091
Any news on my wife yet?

725
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,554
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

726
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:30,934
No radio contact.

727
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,738
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

728
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,538
Here it is.

729
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,277
What happened, Mommy?

730
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:22,356
I don't know, baby.

731
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,234
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

732
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,448
Our target is to the north...

733
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,831
...centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

734
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,957
Our Black Knight Squadron...

735
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,460
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

736
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:38,997
- You?
- Nope.

737
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:44,591
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.

738
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,723
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

739
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:51,476
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.

740
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,351
You'll get your chance.

741
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,857
You'll all get your chance.

742
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,814
Good hunting.

743
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,486
Dismissed!

744
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,986
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

745
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,701
Ready to go, sir!

746
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:11,405
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, captain!

747
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:13,494
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

748
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:18,254
- Got your victory dance?
- Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

749
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:22,258
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

750
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:24,089
I'm all ears, brother!

751
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,353
You the man!

752
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,153
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

753
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,482
General Grey here.

754
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,649
Al?

755
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,535
All communications with
the cities are down.

756
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:51,612
All systems gone.

757
00:58:51,624 --> 00:58:54,119
For intelligence, we
believe it's a total loss.

758
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,875
How about our boys? Where are they?

759
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,703
ETA to target, four minutes.

760
00:59:07,836 --> 00:59:09,509
I shouldn't have left her.

761
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,514
Don't worry about it, big man.

762
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:14,722
I'm sure she got out of here
before it happened.

763
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:18,059
Or, as the good Reverend would say...

764
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:22,397
..."Why <i>we're on
this particular mission, we'll never know."</i>

765
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,438
"But I do know, here today...

766
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:28,824
...that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again."

767
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,156
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.

768
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:47,876
Holy God!

769
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,306
Lock and load!

770
00:59:56,176 --> 01:00:00,056
Roger that. L.A. attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

771
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:02,850
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock-on.

772
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,063
Fire at will.

773
01:00:04,226 --> 01:00:06,228
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

774
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:11,283
Knights, we are red and free.
Knight One, fox three!

775
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,660
Knight Three, fox three!

776
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,696
Knight Seven, fox three.

777
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,701
Missiles have been fired.

778
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,769
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.

779
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:46,060
Command, Knight One.
Switching to Sidewinders, moving in.

780
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,824
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

781
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,161
Knight Seven, 120.

782
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,788
Knight One, sweep lock. Fox two.

783
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,540
Knight Seven...

784
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:05,954
Come on, come on!

785
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:15,468
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!

786
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:24,140
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

787
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,979
Pull up!

788
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:27,518
Agh!

789
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,656
Blow through, blow through!

790
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:39,196
Too many of them!

791
01:01:40,989 --> 01:01:42,662
They got another one, sir.

792
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:49,001
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

793
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:54,011
I got you covered, Big Daddy!

794
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,053
Damn, they got shields, too!

795
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,696
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

796
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:18,826
Jesus!

797
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,862
They got another one, sir. And two more.

798
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:23,373
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing it.

799
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,499
All right, get them out of there.

800
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,415
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback
position. Abort mission right away!

801
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:37,342
We're gonna have to make a run for
this one! Let's get low and fast!

802
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,506
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get them!

803
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,095
Whoo!

804
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,009
Watch the deck!

805
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:55,398
- Squadron leader, abort! Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

806
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,655
Get them out!

807
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,909
- The monitor! Where's the picture?
- We've lost the satellite.

808
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:14,007
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

809
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,969
Come on, come on! Move, move, move!

810
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,536
It's gonna be like white
on rice, Big Daddy!

811
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,847
They ain't got nothing for us!
Let's push it!

812
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:28,230
- I can't shake them.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

813
01:03:28,388 --> 01:03:30,891
- I'm gonna try something.
- Nothing stupid!

814
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,604
- You know me!
- That's what I mean.

815
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:35,941
- Aah!
- Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

816
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,283
<i>Jimmy, he's closing on you!</i>

817
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:44,989
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- I can't breathe!

818
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,037
Jimmy!

819
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,164
Jimmy!

820
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:54,001
Jimmy, no!

821
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,132
Affirmative. We have incoming.

822
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,714
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

823
01:03:58,877 --> 01:04:00,220
Friendly?

824
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,301
Sergeant?

825
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,558
I don't think so.

826
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,287
Come on and get me!

827
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,089
What are you shooting at?

828
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,970
Where you at, baby?! Come on! Come on!

829
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:49,602
You can't hit nothing!

830
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:08,742
Whoa! Low bridge!

831
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:16,246
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

832
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:21,501
Ha-ha! Hope you got an airbag!

833
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,012
Whoo!

834
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,498
Aah!

835
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,174
Son of a bitch!

836
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:04,966
Aah!

837
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:06,926
That's right! That's right!

838
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,886
Get off! Get off of me!

839
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,971
That's what you'll get! Ha-ha!

840
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,477
Look at you!

841
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,730
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

842
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,768
Huh? Who's the man?!
Wait till I get another plane!

843
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,482
I'm lining all your friends up,
right beside you!

844
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,778
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

845
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,754
Welcome to Earth.

846
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,850
That's what I call a close encounter.

847
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,525
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

848
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,111
Keys. Come on, keys.

849
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,579
Yes!

850
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:16,617
Come, baby, come on. Come on!

851
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,455
Yes!

852
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:22,589
<i>Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world...</i>

853
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:24,340
<i>...with the same results.</i>

854
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:29,129
You're just like your mother, you
know that? She was stubborn too.

855
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,515
I had to twist her arm
to get her to take her medicine.

856
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,145
- You're gonna be all right.
- You're gonna be fine.

857
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,726
See, Troy? You're feeling better already.

858
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:47,652
I couldn't find anything.
Everyone's packing up. They're leaving.

859
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,284
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave too, then.

860
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,039
Penicillin. It'll help keep his fever down.

861
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:59,371
Thank you. It's really
nice of you to help us.

862
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,003
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

863
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:04,463
I-I'm going with you.

864
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:11,467
Um... Well... l-| just mean that...
that we're going too.

865
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,676
Cool.

866
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:14,951
Tell that punk to shut the door.
We're out

867
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:17,185
of here. He can sniff
around somewhere else.

868
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,515
- Bye.
- Bye.

869
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:30,194
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

870
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,360
- I don't feel too good.
- Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

871
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,446
Could be bad weather or good weather.

872
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,365
We could go up or down.

873
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,580
We could go back, we could go forwards,
side to side...

874
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:46,998
What did I say?

875
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,544
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

876
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,923
Julius, with all of this, I, uh...

877
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:57,183
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

878
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,846
All he could think of was getting to you.

879
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:06,067
There's still love there, I think.

880
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:10,447
Love was never a problem.

881
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,074
All you need is love.

882
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,610
John Lennon. Smart man.

883
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,825
Shot in the back, very sad.

884
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:23,619
We've moved as many of
our forces away from our bases as possible.

885
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:28,165
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- I spoke with the joint chiefs at NORAD.

886
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:31,585
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.

887
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,173
Over American soil?

888
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:37,682
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

889
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,094
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

890
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,183
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

891
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:45,599
- What?
- It's gone, sir.

892
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,438
My God!

893
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,853
The vice president? The joint chiefs?

894
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:52,067
Mr. President.

895
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,024
We must launch.

896
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:58,696
A delay now would be more costly than
when you waited to evacuate the cities.

897
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,981
You're not gonna launch
nuclear weapons.

898
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:03,332
You'll kill them and us.
If we fire nukes...

899
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:06,062
Sir, may I remind you,
you are a guest here?

900
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:07,997
You ever hear of
nuclear winter?

901
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:11,041
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.

902
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,175
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

903
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,383
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

904
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,971
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!

905
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,228
None of you did anything to prevent this!

906
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:27,061
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

907
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,476
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.

908
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:32,691
It was, what?
In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

909
01:10:33,563 --> 01:10:36,988
- Dad. Look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

910
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,244
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.

911
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:43,248
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!

912
01:10:43,406 --> 01:10:45,659
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.

913
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,872
Where was that?

914
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,377
Area 51 . Right?

915
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,915
Area 51. You knew then!
And you did nothing.

916
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,339
Sir.

917
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:58,254
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids...

918
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:02,267
...there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

919
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,894
- Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.
- Psh...

920
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:07,100
And there's no recovered spaceship.

921
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,358
Uh, excuse me, Mr. President...

922
01:11:10,767 --> 01:11:14,397
That's not entirely... accurate.

923
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,369
What? Which part?

924
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,534
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

925
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:32,250
Sorry.

926
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:51,975
The end hath come!

927
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,691
He spaketh his word and the end hath come!

928
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,777
Hop on! We're heading out to El Toro!

929
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,826
You cannot defy what hath come!

930
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,989
<i>It's the end!</i>

931
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:12,461
El Toro?!

932
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,925
- Can you give me a hand?
- Sure.

933
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:30,889
Oh, God...

934
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,156
Okay, okay, let's get this off.

935
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:42,362
Here, let me help you.

936
01:12:45,403 --> 01:12:47,405
She's hurt pretty badly.

937
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:54,546
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

938
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,753
But, no!

939
01:12:57,915 --> 01:13:02,261
You got me out here, dragging your heavy
ass through the burning desert...

940
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,720
...with your dreadlocks
sticking out the back of my parachute.

941
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,763
You gotta come down here
with an attitude...

942
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,020
...acting all big and bad.

943
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,475
And what the hell is that smell?!

944
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:18,193
Arrrrgh!

945
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:21,572
I could've been at a barbecue!

946
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,530
But I ain't mad.

947
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:28,201
It's all right, it's all right.

948
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,428
Hey!

949
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,382
Hey! Hey...

950
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:53,850
Hey!

951
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,077
Do you need a lift, soldier?

952
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:12,285
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

953
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:16,502
It ain't on the map.

954
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,831
Trust me, it's there.

955
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:36,723
Attention!

956
01:14:40,685 --> 01:14:42,653
Mr. President. General.

957
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:45,816
Welcome to Area 51. Please follow me.

958
01:14:47,358 --> 01:14:49,827
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface...

959
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,830
...and, uh... here's our
main research facility.

960
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:54,218
Let's see it.

961
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:57,327
Sorry, sir, it's a clean room.
It's static free...

962
01:14:57,493 --> 01:14:59,791
Open... the door.

963
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,673
Yes, sir.

964
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,646
My God.

965
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,907
Why the hell wasn't I
told about this place?

966
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:32,241
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

967
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:41,624
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

968
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:44,381
How do you get funding
for something like this?

969
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,635
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer...

970
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,841
"$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?"

971
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,016
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

972
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:58,351
He has headed up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

973
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,478
How do you do?

974
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,522
<i>Mr. President!</i>

975
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,562
Wow!

976
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,776
Uh... This...

977
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,986
What a pleasure!

978
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:12,242
As you can imagine, they...

979
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:14,278
They don't let us out much.

980
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,158
I can understand that.

981
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,618
Well!

982
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:24,539
I guess you'd like to see
the big tamale, huh?

983
01:16:24,705 --> 01:16:26,048
Follow me.

984
01:17:16,841 --> 01:17:19,219
She's a beaut, ain't she?

985
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,994
As you can see from the
repairs, we've been

986
01:17:24,006 --> 01:17:26,772
trying to put her back
together since the '60s.

987
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,858
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about them?

988
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,272
Oh, hell, no.

989
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,611
No, no, no, no. We know tons about them.

990
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,368
But the neatest stuff...

991
01:17:36,527 --> 01:17:39,531
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

992
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:44,294
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

993
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:49,457
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

994
01:17:49,623 --> 01:17:53,127
The last 24 hours
have been really exciting!

995
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,638
Exciting? People are dying out there.

996
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:58,424
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!

997
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:03,054
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

998
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:05,564
You said you can repair their technology.

999
01:18:05,723 --> 01:18:08,045
Can you tell us anything
useful about them?

1000
01:18:08,057 --> 01:18:09,478
Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...

1001
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,771
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

1002
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:16,192
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

1003
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,157
Probably why they're
interested in our planet.

1004
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,739
Hey...

1005
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,453
Hey.

1006
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:26,460
You guys wanna see them?

1007
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:29,413
Hmm?

1008
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,047
Uh, this is...

1009
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,262
This is the vault.

1010
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,889
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

1011
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:46,013
<i>...the</i> freak show.

1012
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:10,253
When we found them...

1013
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,757
...they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

1014
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:17,420
Once we got them off, we learned a
great deal about their anatomy.

1015
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,763
Eyes, ears...

1016
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,595
...no vocal cords.

1017
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,136
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

1018
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:29,478
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

1019
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,486
No, it's some kind of
extrasensory perception. Telepathy.

1020
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:35,233
So...

1021
01:19:37,481 --> 01:19:39,575
It's an organic life form.

1022
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,496
Can they be killed?

1023
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,657
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

1024
01:19:46,824 --> 01:19:49,247
These two died in the crash.

1025
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:51,253
This one a few weeks later.

1026
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:55,383
You just... have to get through
their technology, which is...

1027
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,511
...I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

1028
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:03,265
David, you unlocked part
of their technology.

1029
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:04,880
You cracked the code.

1030
01:20:04,892 --> 01:20:08,021
No, no. All I did was
stumble on their, um...

1031
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:11,307
...signal. I don't know
how, uh... helpful I can be.

1032
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,651
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

1033
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:18,272
Figure out what they
haven't thought of yet.

1034
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:23,828
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

1035
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:35,081
What code?

1036
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:58,271
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1037
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:01,111
I'm sorry, captain. You
don't have clearance.

1038
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,114
Okay. Come here.

1039
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:05,994
You wanna see my clearance?

1040
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,793
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let them pass.

1041
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,997
- Let them pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

1042
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,083
Did you see that?

1043
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:21,711
Come on down.

1044
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:23,220
Watch your step.

1045
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:28,809
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.

1046
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,390
Though how they sat on them, I don't know.

1047
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:32,771
<i>Gently.</i>

1048
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:35,558
- Uh... You see these gizmos flashing?
- Yeah.

1049
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,228
We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this.

1050
01:21:39,395 --> 01:21:41,318
Some stuff we figured out right away.

1051
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:45,656
Uh... This we're pretty sure
is the life support for the cabin.

1052
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:48,788
And, uh...
this doohickey is connected to...

1053
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:54,710
Oh... Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?

1054
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:59,249
Uh... These configurations... uh...

1055
01:22:01,333 --> 01:22:05,383
Well... To be honest,
we don't know what the hell this crap is.

1056
01:22:06,171 --> 01:22:11,428
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.

1057
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:13,595
Ha-ha! Neat, huh?

1058
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:18,188
Uh, could somebody grab my laptop there?
Can I just have the computer inside?

1059
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,192
What?

1060
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:23,151
These patterns are repeating sequentially,
like their countdown signal.

1061
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:26,613
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

1062
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:30,029
See? That's how
they're coordinating their ships.

1063
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:31,868
You know...

1064
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,499
...you're really starting
to make us look bad.

1065
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,794
They got one! They got one alive!

1066
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,837
- They got one, alive!
- Jesus!

1067
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,382
Uh... You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?

1068
01:22:49,882 --> 01:22:50,883
Fine.

1069
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,097
Uh... Don't touch anything.

1070
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,394
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.

1071
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:03,487
Oh! It's all wet...

1072
01:23:13,113 --> 01:23:15,411
Right here! He's in the back of the pickup.

1073
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:23,837
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

1074
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:25,672
Guess who's coming to dinner!

1075
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:29,509
I need a doctor. I need a doctor!

1076
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,722
Oh, boy! How long
has he been unconscious?

1077
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:37,308
- About three hours.
- Let's get him in containment.

1078
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:40,975
My son... he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!

1079
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:43,985
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.

1080
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:47,273
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex!
Please!

1081
01:23:50,317 --> 01:23:53,070
If you don't do something right now,
my son will die!

1082
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:57,454
- Just help him!
- Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.

1083
01:23:57,616 --> 01:24:00,460
You... take us to him, okay? Let's go.

1084
01:24:02,996 --> 01:24:05,215
All right! Move it, move it, move it!

1085
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:09,337
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

1086
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,943
When were you planning to inform us?

1087
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,134
- It had been deemed classified.
- You should have told us about this

1088
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,347
when they first arrived!

1089
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,639
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack...

1090
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:22,308
...that cost the lives of
hundreds of our pilots!

1091
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:26,479
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!

1092
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:27,817
Mr. President.

1093
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:31,701
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

1094
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:35,078
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

1095
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:36,955
Destroyed.

1096
01:24:37,114 --> 01:24:41,335
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

1097
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:42,870
Then we were hit.

1098
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:46,131
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

1099
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,384
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15 percent.

1100
01:24:48,542 --> 01:24:53,594
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on...

1101
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:57,931
...we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city...

1102
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:01,097
...in the next 36 hours.

1103
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,226
We're being exterminated.

1104
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:10,697
Mr. President!

1105
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:13,154
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

1106
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,694
- Captain.
- Mr. President.

1107
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:15,907
Well done.

1108
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:16,985
Where is it now?

1109
01:25:16,997 --> 01:25:19,369
It's isolated in the
containment lab, sir.

1110
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,744
I'd like to go see it.

1111
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:31,548
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

1112
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:36,299
Hasn't anyone told you?

1113
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,850
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

1114
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,950
- We were lucky.
- Yeah!

1115
01:26:37,109 --> 01:26:39,578
Today was the first time I used the subway.

1116
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,704
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

1117
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:44,241
These should last us a while.

1118
01:26:44,408 --> 01:26:46,627
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

1119
01:26:48,537 --> 01:26:50,539
He's your son?

1120
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,333
He's my angel.

1121
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,837
Was his father stationed here?

1122
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:58,004
No, he, uh...

1123
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:00,219
He wasn't his father.

1124
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,102
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

1125
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,652
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

1126
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,529
Oh... Ballet...

1127
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:17,441
No. Exotic.

1128
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,946
Oh... Sorry.

1129
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:24,498
Don't be. I'm not.

1130
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:27,079
It's good money. Besides...

1131
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,085
...my baby's worth it.

1132
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,372
Dylan! Come here.

1133
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,632
I want you to meet the First Lady.

1134
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,256
- Hello.
- Hi.

1135
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:42,766
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

1136
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,926
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

1137
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,016
I voted for the other guy.

1138
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:54,357
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

1139
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:55,771
Come on, come on.

1140
01:27:55,937 --> 01:27:57,564
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

1141
01:27:57,731 --> 01:28:00,280
Put the spreader right
here, along the ridge.

1142
01:28:00,442 --> 01:28:04,413
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

1143
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,707
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

1144
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,789
Let me get in.

1145
01:28:15,957 --> 01:28:18,005
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

1146
01:28:19,002 --> 01:28:21,050
Run this right in...

1147
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:28,637
All right. Okay.

1148
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,184
Let's proceed.

1149
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:34,021
Now comes the... the really icky part.

1150
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:36,024
Ugh!

1151
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:38,109
Oh, boy.

1152
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:41,821
This is one smelly, disgusting...

1153
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,368
Oh, look at it.

1154
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:53,503
It doesn't look alive, does it?

1155
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,759
The arm is moving.

1156
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,855
- Agh!
- Doctor? Doctor?

1157
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:16,352
Doctor?

1158
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,195
- Agh!
- Don't move!

1159
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:06,283
Dr. Okun?

1160
01:30:29,466 --> 01:30:32,936
<i>Release... me.</i>

1161
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,313
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.

1162
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:52,451
Release me...

1163
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:59,037
...now.

1164
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,754
I know there is much
we can learn from each other...

1165
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:10,390
...if we can negotiate a truce.

1166
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:13,594
We can find a way to coexist.

1167
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:17,518
Can there be a peace between us?

1168
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:20,976
Peace...

1169
01:31:22,185 --> 01:31:24,483
No peace.

1170
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,366
What is it you want us to do?

1171
01:31:34,864 --> 01:31:36,741
Die.

1172
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:47,719
Die!

1173
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:54,514
Mr. President.

1174
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,888
- Is that glass bulletproof?
- No, sir.

1175
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,872
- Are you all right?
- I saw...

1176
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:21,582
...his thoughts.

1177
01:32:22,537 --> 01:32:24,585
I saw what they're planning to do.

1178
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,294
They're like locusts.

1179
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:31,463
They're moving from planet to planet.

1180
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:33,723
Their whole civilization.

1181
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:37,557
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.

1182
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,181
And we're next.

1183
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,619
Nuke them.

1184
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,907
Let's nuke the bastards.

1185
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,257
Just my luck. No ice.

1186
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:14,597
I take it you've heard?

1187
01:33:15,340 --> 01:33:16,933
Hey, toast.

1188
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:19,094
To the end of the world.

1189
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,638
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

1190
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:23,899
He didn't have any other choice.

1191
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,935
Well, you still believe in him.

1192
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:29,150
Well, he's a good man.

1193
01:33:29,646 --> 01:33:30,772
<i>Whoa...</i>

1194
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,442
He'd better be. You left me for him.

1195
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:36,532
Or, you know... for your career.

1196
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,197
You know, it wasn't just my career.

1197
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:41,787
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

1198
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:46,080
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

1199
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:49,466
And, um... I wasn't, um...

1200
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,592
...ambitious enough for you?

1201
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:55,801
David, you could have done anything
you wanted. Research, development...

1202
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,591
Honey, I was happy where I was.

1203
01:33:57,757 --> 01:34:00,510
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

1204
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:06,478
I was part of something special.

1205
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:23,787
Well, if it makes any difference...

1206
01:34:23,950 --> 01:34:25,998
...I never stopped loving you.

1207
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,422
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1208
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:49,980
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

1209
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:59,865
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule!

1210
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,530
Pick it up, man!

1211
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:03,915
Pick it up!

1212
01:35:06,409 --> 01:35:09,128
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!

1213
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,548
I got something I gotta handle.
I'm borrowing it.

1214
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,924
No, you're not, sir.

1215
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,553
Do you really wanna shoot me?

1216
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:20,382
Just tell them I hit you.

1217
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,815
<i>Command, this is Retal Op.</i>

1218
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:32,398
Squadron is in the air. We are on
station and awaiting instructions.

1219
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,312
Break formation. Head to targets.

1220
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,785
Sir.

1221
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:42,742
They're breaking formation.

1222
01:35:42,904 --> 01:35:47,080
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1223
01:35:47,242 --> 01:35:48,994
Which city will be reached first?

1224
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:52,539
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1225
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:55,549
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

1226
01:35:55,708 --> 01:36:00,339
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1227
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,226
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1228
01:36:05,385 --> 01:36:06,807
We are in position.

1229
01:36:07,387 --> 01:36:09,435
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1230
01:36:09,597 --> 01:36:12,316
We are going to visual recon.

1231
01:36:12,475 --> 01:36:14,102
<i>Roger.</i>

1232
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:20,863
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1233
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:24,325
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1234
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:29,326
Laser targeting.

1235
01:36:29,492 --> 01:36:30,914
Locked on.

1236
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:34,380
We're locked on, sir.
Do you wish to deploy?

1237
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:41,429
Mr. President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

1238
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,309
- Mr. President?
- Deploy.

1239
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:53,224
That's a go. Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1240
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,813
Here we go.

1241
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,614
Bird's away.

1242
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,951
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.

1243
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,249
<i>Approaching.</i>

1244
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,876
May our children forgive us.

1245
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:16,165
<i>Five seconds to impact. Three, two...</i>

1246
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,457
...one.

1247
01:37:19,584 --> 01:37:21,427
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!

1248
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:28,347
Get down! Get down!

1249
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:31,183
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

1250
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:34,190
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

1251
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:35,350
Yes, sir!

1252
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:38,690
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

1253
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:41,857
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have <i>lost visual.</i>

1254
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,492
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1255
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:53,121
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1256
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:56,254
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

1257
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:01,714
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

1258
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,503
Has the target been destroyed?

1259
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:18,939
Negative.

1260
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:24,152
<i>Target remains.</i>

1261
01:38:26,484 --> 01:38:29,829
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>

1262
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:35,034
Call the other planes back.

1263
01:38:35,201 --> 01:38:38,956
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1264
01:38:39,122 --> 01:38:41,375
I said call them back!

1265
01:38:44,085 --> 01:38:46,679
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1266
01:38:46,838 --> 01:38:50,763
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1267
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:32,016
<i>Jasmine!</i>

1268
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,651
You're late!

1269
01:39:45,813 --> 01:39:48,532
You know I like to make an entrance.

1270
01:39:57,658 --> 01:40:00,036
- Where are we going?
- Through there, sir.

1271
01:40:00,203 --> 01:40:03,548
Mr. President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1272
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,528
Perhaps if we had
gotten to her earlier...

1273
01:40:06,540 --> 01:40:08,303
Hey, there she is! Go on!

1274
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:14,476
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

1275
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:18,229
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

1276
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,815
We can't stop the bleeding.

1277
01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,526
If We'd...

1278
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:25,812
There's nothing we can do for her.

1279
01:40:27,688 --> 01:40:30,316
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1280
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,664
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1281
01:40:37,823 --> 01:40:39,871
I did?

1282
01:40:42,036 --> 01:40:44,209
You just keep growing and growing.

1283
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,084
I can't...

1284
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,216
Hey.

1285
01:40:51,379 --> 01:40:55,805
Can you, uh, wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

1286
01:40:55,967 --> 01:40:57,469
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1287
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:10,739
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1288
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:12,741
Oh...

1289
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:14,951
It's okay.

1290
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,789
The doctors...

1291
01:41:20,283 --> 01:41:22,251
...think that you're...

1292
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:24,458
...gonna be just fine.

1293
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:28,962
Liar.

1294
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:27,184
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1295
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,653
Yeah.

1296
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:34,157
Mommy's sleeping.

1297
01:42:37,485 --> 01:42:39,203
Hey.

1298
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:11,064
David!

1299
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,651
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm making a mess!

1300
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,361
Yeah. This I can see.

1301
01:43:16,524 --> 01:43:19,152
We gotta burn this toxic waste...

1302
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,537
...pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1303
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24,245
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...

1304
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:27,284
...they won't want it anymore.

1305
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:29,044
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.

1306
01:43:29,203 --> 01:43:32,377
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1307
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:35,669
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1308
01:43:35,835 --> 01:43:38,088
David! Even myself.

1309
01:43:39,422 --> 01:43:42,141
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1310
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,856
You see, sometimes...

1311
01:43:50,015 --> 01:43:52,143
...we have to remember what we still have.

1312
01:43:53,519 --> 01:43:55,112
Like what?

1313
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:01,911
Well... you still have your health.

1314
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,140
David, David, you need your rest.

1315
01:44:05,948 --> 01:44:08,827
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1316
01:44:11,829 --> 01:44:14,173
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1317
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,959
- Well, you see, a man...
- No, no, no.

1318
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,544
No, the other part.

1319
01:44:18,556 --> 01:44:21,757
What? What? I don't
want you to catch cold.

1320
01:44:25,176 --> 01:44:26,803
Dahhh!

1321
01:44:26,969 --> 01:44:29,347
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1322
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:32,437
- Genius.
- Genius?

1323
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:35,395
My dad. A total genius.

1324
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:39,106
Jerry, wake up.

1325
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:42,243
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1326
01:44:46,363 --> 01:44:47,740
Look at that!

1327
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:51,252
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1328
01:44:51,410 --> 01:44:53,879
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1329
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,550
- They're here.
- All right, what's this all about?

1330
01:44:58,709 --> 01:44:59,881
I have no idea.

1331
01:45:00,044 --> 01:45:01,261
Get everybody off.

1332
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,720
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1333
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:06,217
Major Mitchell.

1334
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:08,181
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1335
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:11,348
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1336
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,734
See that, uh... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1337
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:18,021
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1338
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:19,860
Do it. Shoot it.

1339
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:22,992
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1340
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:30,991
What the hell are you doing?!

1341
01:45:31,158 --> 01:45:33,160
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1342
01:45:33,327 --> 01:45:36,672
You see, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

1343
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,334
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?

1344
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:44,006
My point is, if we can't beat their
defenses, then we gotta get around them.

1345
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:47,766
Major. One more time... Any time.

1346
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:01,989
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1347
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:06,618
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1348
01:46:07,236 --> 01:46:09,534
Are you telling us you
can send out a signal...

1349
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,699
...that will disable all their shields?

1350
01:46:11,866 --> 01:46:15,040
That's right. Just like they used
our satellites against us...

1351
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:17,330
...we can use their own
signal against them.

1352
01:46:17,496 --> 01:46:20,215
If we plant a virus into
that mother ship...

1353
01:46:20,374 --> 01:46:23,969
...it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1354
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,971
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1355
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:30,510
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?

1356
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:33,680
We're... We're gonna, uh...

1357
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:38,856
...have to... um... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1358
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:42,898
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

1359
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:47,694
We then upload the virus, set off some
kind of explosion which will disable it.

1360
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:53,742
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to, uh...

1361
01:46:54,491 --> 01:46:57,335
to... take them... take them out.
Take them down.

1362
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:00,088
Do your... Do your stuff.

1363
01:47:00,247 --> 01:47:04,218
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1364
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:08,097
Uh... I don't know. A matter of minutes.

1365
01:47:08,255 --> 01:47:11,555
You want us to coordinate
a worldwide counterstrike...

1366
01:47:11,717 --> 01:47:13,594
...with a window of a few minutes?

1367
01:47:13,761 --> 01:47:17,231
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1368
01:47:17,389 --> 01:47:21,110
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1369
01:47:21,268 --> 01:47:23,691
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan...

1370
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:27,609
...depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1371
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,277
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1372
01:47:30,444 --> 01:47:34,290
I've seen them in action. I'm aware
of their maneuvering capabilities.

1373
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:38,585
With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1374
01:47:39,495 --> 01:47:41,748
That thing is a wreck.

1375
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:43,916
It crash-landed back in the '50s.

1376
01:47:44,083 --> 01:47:46,381
We don't even know if
it's capable of flying!

1377
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,966
Jim, uh... remove the clamps.

1378
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:12,945
Any questions?

1379
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,702
Let's do it.

1380
01:48:23,038 --> 01:48:24,790
All right, you heard the president...

1381
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:28,336
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

1382
01:48:28,502 --> 01:48:30,596
A virus.

1383
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,923
Your idea.

1384
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:35,138
That's right.

1385
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:43,818
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1386
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:47,480
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1387
01:48:54,862 --> 01:48:55,954
Whoo!

1388
01:48:56,113 --> 01:48:58,707
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1389
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:01,710
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1390
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:06,375
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1391
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:09,293
- You don't understand!
- However...

1392
01:49:09,460 --> 01:49:13,055
...that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.

1393
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,215
- Mr. President...
- Mr. Nimziki...

1394
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:16,804
...you're fired.

1395
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:24,483
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

1396
01:49:24,641 --> 01:49:25,893
Yes, sir.

1397
01:49:26,060 --> 01:49:27,607
He can't do that.

1398
01:49:27,770 --> 01:49:30,569
Well, he just, uh... did.

1399
01:49:34,401 --> 01:49:38,747
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1400
01:49:38,906 --> 01:49:41,705
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1401
01:49:41,867 --> 01:49:45,917
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1402
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:53,088
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1403
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:08,110
It's from the Americans.

1404
01:50:09,478 --> 01:50:11,731
They want to organize a counteroffensive!

1405
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:14,901
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1406
01:50:37,172 --> 01:50:40,392
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions...

1407
01:50:40,551 --> 01:50:42,964
...in Europe, the
Middle East, and Asia.

1408
01:50:42,976 --> 01:50:45,682
Impressive. Considering
it's all done with...

1409
01:50:45,848 --> 01:50:47,145
Morse code.

1410
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:51,274
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1411
01:50:51,436 --> 01:50:54,656
- But what?
- Pilots are coming up short.

1412
01:50:54,815 --> 01:50:56,738
Well, then, find them.

1413
01:50:56,900 --> 01:50:59,090
<i>Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan</i>

1414
01:50:59,102 --> 01:51:01,406
<i>trade rumors of military
forces in hiding...</i>

1415
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:05,793
<i>...unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...</i>

1416
01:51:06,785 --> 01:51:09,208
We're planning to launch
a counteroffensive.

1417
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:10,964
With our depleted manpower...

1418
01:51:11,123 --> 01:51:14,423
...we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1419
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:19,591
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would be useful.

1420
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,934
I can fly. I'm a pilot.

1421
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:27,348
All right, guys! Listen up!

1422
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:31,314
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1423
01:51:31,476 --> 01:51:33,649
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression...

1424
01:51:33,812 --> 01:51:36,656
...but this is a crash course
in modern avionics.

1425
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:39,364
- Keep it coming.
- Okay, you got it!

1426
01:51:39,526 --> 01:51:41,699
All right, listen up. Before we begin...

1427
01:51:41,862 --> 01:51:45,116
...we need some background information
on your experience.

1428
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:47,284
Let's start with you.

1429
01:51:47,451 --> 01:51:48,668
Who, me?

1430
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:52,960
Well, I'm, uh, Russell Casse, sir.

1431
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:58,299
And, uh... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1432
01:51:59,004 --> 01:52:01,632
And, uh... been doing that ever since.

1433
01:52:02,174 --> 01:52:06,600
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh...

1434
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:10,975
...ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago...

1435
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:13,064
...I have been dying for some payback.

1436
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:17,482
I just want you to know
that, uh... I won't let you down.

1437
01:52:19,024 --> 01:52:21,072
You have one tactical nuclear missile...

1438
01:52:21,235 --> 01:52:24,489
...we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1439
01:52:24,655 --> 01:52:26,578
This is the firing mechanism.

1440
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:29,289
It'll be attached to the
ship's main console.

1441
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:31,579
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1442
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:34,339
Except the nuke will not
detonate at impact.

1443
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:38,339
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1444
01:52:39,336 --> 01:52:40,963
Good luck, gentlemen.

1445
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,382
30 seconds.

1446
01:52:43,548 --> 01:52:45,601
It's the strongest radio
transmitter we had.

1447
01:52:45,613 --> 01:52:47,724
It'll tell us when you've
uploaded the virus.

1448
01:52:47,886 --> 01:52:50,765
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1449
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:54,652
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1450
01:52:56,311 --> 01:52:58,405
Why you? David!

1451
01:52:58,814 --> 01:53:01,363
I don't... I don't understand...

1452
01:53:01,525 --> 01:53:05,200
...why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1453
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,080
No, no. Something may go wrong.

1454
01:53:07,239 --> 01:53:10,083
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1455
01:53:10,242 --> 01:53:13,917
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1456
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:20,803
Here's my chance.

1457
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:25,215
Now he gets ambitious.

1458
01:53:25,882 --> 01:53:28,635
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1459
01:53:28,802 --> 01:53:31,555
Okay. All right, I guess
that's good enough.

1460
01:53:31,722 --> 01:53:33,816
So. How do I look?

1461
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:37,611
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1462
01:53:39,730 --> 01:53:42,779
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1463
01:53:42,941 --> 01:53:45,820
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1464
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:50,161
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1465
01:53:50,324 --> 01:53:52,418
Sorry for what, babe?

1466
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:56,250
I should have done this a long time ago.

1467
01:53:56,413 --> 01:53:59,758
- Do you have the ring?
- Uh... Yes, sir.

1468
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:02,840
- Here, make yourself useful.
- Ow!

1469
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:06,298
Witnesses?

1470
01:54:06,465 --> 01:54:08,513
Um...

1471
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:13,439
- We got hung up.
- Well, let's get this show on the road.

1472
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:17,352
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God...

1473
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:20,316
...and in the presence
of these witnesses...

1474
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:23,403
...to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1475
01:54:23,565 --> 01:54:27,490
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed...

1476
01:54:27,652 --> 01:54:31,156
...please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1477
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,295
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife...

1478
01:54:37,454 --> 01:54:40,503
...to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1479
01:54:41,375 --> 01:54:46,131
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health...

1480
01:54:46,296 --> 01:54:48,549
...and, forsaking all others...

1481
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,686
...keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1482
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,230
I Will.

1483
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,475
<i>Whoo!</i>

1484
01:55:06,608 --> 01:55:08,702
Good morning.

1485
01:55:12,197 --> 01:55:14,291
They're a little young.

1486
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:17,044
That they are.

1487
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:20,380
They look a little nervous.

1488
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:24,134
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1489
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:28,255
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1490
01:55:29,714 --> 01:55:31,387
Good morning.

1491
01:55:33,051 --> 01:55:34,553
<i>Good morning.</i>

1492
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,687
In less than an hour...

1493
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:44,481
...aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1494
01:55:44,646 --> 01:55:50,198
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1495
01:55:52,028 --> 01:55:53,075
Mankind.

1496
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:57,084
That... word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1497
01:55:58,618 --> 01:56:01,838
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.

1498
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:06,509
We will be united in our common interest.

1499
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:11,385
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1500
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:15,891
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1501
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:20,399
Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.

1502
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:25,070
But from annihilation.

1503
01:56:26,021 --> 01:56:28,365
We're fighting for our right to live.

1504
01:56:29,983 --> 01:56:31,451
To exist.

1505
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,705
And should we win the day...

1506
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:39,918
...the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday...

1507
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:44,081
...but as the day
when the world declared in one voice...

1508
01:56:44,247 --> 01:56:46,716
..."We will not go
quietly into the night!"

1509
01:56:47,542 --> 01:56:50,512
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

1510
01:56:51,463 --> 01:56:53,557
"We're going to live on!"

1511
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:56,226
"We're going to survive!"

1512
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:01,060
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1513
01:57:03,934 --> 01:57:05,151
Yeah!

1514
01:57:26,039 --> 01:57:28,713
- Let's go!
- Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

1515
01:57:29,209 --> 01:57:31,382
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1516
01:57:31,545 --> 01:57:35,846
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is
here. You've got your choice of helmets.

1517
01:57:38,635 --> 01:57:41,138
Mr. President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1518
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:43,853
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1519
01:57:46,101 --> 01:57:48,274
I belong in the air.

1520
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:57,446
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1521
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:03,873
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1522
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,929
Here. Take these.

1523
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,218
Just in case.

1524
01:58:19,634 --> 01:58:20,977
Where's... Where's...

1525
01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:33,820
Just in case.

1526
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:38,119
I'm very proud of you.

1527
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:52,129
Be careful, okay?

1528
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:00,012
It's time.

1529
01:59:05,555 --> 01:59:06,807
I love you.

1530
01:59:07,182 --> 01:59:08,934
I love you.

1531
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,483
Oh, damn! Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1532
01:59:16,650 --> 01:59:19,403
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't...
- Here! Here!

1533
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:21,617
Take these. My last two.

1534
01:59:22,572 --> 01:59:24,825
You are a lifesaver.

1535
01:59:25,325 --> 01:59:27,794
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1536
01:59:55,563 --> 01:59:57,782
<i>- Missile launch.
- Oh, crap!</i>

1537
01:59:58,441 --> 02:00:00,034
What do I hit? Which one?

1538
02:00:02,278 --> 02:00:04,997
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.

1539
02:00:20,338 --> 02:00:22,636
This is our victory dance.

1540
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,884
Not until the fat lady sings.

1541
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:27,554
Oh. Yes, okay.

1542
02:00:27,721 --> 02:00:29,064
This is important.

1543
02:00:29,222 --> 02:00:31,691
Fat lady. I gotcha.

1544
02:00:33,685 --> 02:00:35,733
Open launch tunnel.

1545
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:58,092
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1546
02:00:58,251 --> 02:01:01,004
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.

1547
02:01:01,171 --> 02:01:02,593
Yeah. Is it?

1548
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:07,602
Let's rock 'n' roll.

1549
02:01:10,054 --> 02:01:11,226
Oh!

1550
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:15,484
Oops.

1551
02:01:15,643 --> 02:01:17,816
Oops? What does that mean?

1552
02:01:17,979 --> 02:01:20,903
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1553
02:01:21,065 --> 02:01:23,909
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1554
02:01:24,068 --> 02:01:26,537
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1555
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:29,453
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

1556
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,163
Thataway!

1557
02:01:38,166 --> 02:01:40,464
I have got to get me one of these!

1558
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:51,532
No, no. What was that?
Don't do that!

1559
02:01:51,544 --> 02:01:53,978
Just trying to get a
feel for the old girl.

1560
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,983
No, no, don't. Leave her alone.

1561
02:01:56,559 --> 02:01:58,482
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!

1562
02:02:02,982 --> 02:02:05,531
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1563
02:02:05,693 --> 02:02:09,038
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1564
02:02:09,197 --> 02:02:11,950
<i>- Which way they headed?</i>
- I <i>think our secret's out.</i>

1565
02:02:12,116 --> 02:02:13,868
They're headed straight for us.

1566
02:02:14,035 --> 02:02:16,504
<i>ETA, 26 minutes.</i>

1567
02:02:19,666 --> 02:02:21,464
You still with me over there?

1568
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:24,550
What the hell was I thinking? Oh!

1569
02:02:34,889 --> 02:02:37,688
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1570
02:02:49,195 --> 02:02:51,323
Head straight for it.

1571
02:02:57,161 --> 02:02:59,539
- What the hell...?
- Don't touch them. Don't, don't!

1572
02:02:59,706 --> 02:03:01,299
I was counting on this.

1573
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,551
They are bringing us in.

1574
02:03:04,502 --> 02:03:08,382
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1575
02:03:10,383 --> 02:03:12,886
We've got to work on our communication.

1576
02:03:27,901 --> 02:03:30,029
We have visual.

1577
02:03:30,194 --> 02:03:32,288
Do not engage until we've confirmed...

1578
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:34,575
<i>- ...the package has been delivered.
- Roger.</i>

1579
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:42,753
Major, what happens if
that thing gets here...

1580
02:03:43,291 --> 02:03:45,419
...before the virus is planted?

1581
02:03:45,585 --> 02:03:48,134
This facility's buried
deep within a mountain.

1582
02:03:48,296 --> 02:03:51,140
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1583
02:03:51,299 --> 02:03:53,393
What about the people outside?

1584
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:03,273
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1585
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:04,130
Oh, my God.

1586
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,702
Look at that.

1587
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:50,426
There must be thousands of them.

1588
02:05:50,585 --> 02:05:53,213
Millions of them. What
the hell are they doing?

1589
02:05:54,047 --> 02:05:56,391
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1590
02:06:23,910 --> 02:06:26,834
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1591
02:06:26,996 --> 02:06:28,964
No, no. This thing comes fully loaded.

1592
02:06:29,123 --> 02:06:32,002
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...

1593
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:34,216
...power windows.

1594
02:06:49,977 --> 02:06:51,604
Come on, baby.

1595
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:56,113
We're in.

1596
02:07:01,405 --> 02:07:03,157
Do it. Do it.

1597
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:04,621
Do it.

1598
02:07:04,784 --> 02:07:07,003
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1599
02:07:07,161 --> 02:07:09,289
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1600
02:07:09,455 --> 02:07:11,503
<i>Stand by to engage.</i>

1601
02:07:12,917 --> 02:07:15,136
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1602
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:21,517
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1603
02:07:21,676 --> 02:07:23,895
We need you to grab everything you can.

1604
02:07:24,053 --> 02:07:27,933
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1605
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:32,645
The virus is in.

1606
02:07:38,484 --> 02:07:41,283
All we can do now is... pray.

1607
02:07:42,321 --> 02:07:46,042
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!

1608
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,498
Eagle One. Fox three.

1609
02:07:52,623 --> 02:07:54,341
Gentlemen, this is it.

1610
02:07:57,712 --> 02:07:59,510
Come on, come on, come on.

1611
02:08:12,518 --> 02:08:14,361
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1612
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:16,363
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.

1613
02:08:16,522 --> 02:08:18,570
<i>Rear flank, follow suit.</i>

1614
02:08:19,859 --> 02:08:22,453
<i>Hold on, Command.</i>

1615
02:08:22,612 --> 02:08:26,037
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1616
02:08:26,199 --> 02:08:29,829
Eagle One. Fox three.

1617
02:08:43,883 --> 02:08:44,582
Direct hit!

1618
02:08:44,594 --> 02:08:46,727
It's a hit! Squadron
leaders, fire at will!

1619
02:08:46,886 --> 02:08:48,263
Fire at will!

1620
02:08:48,429 --> 02:08:51,182
We're going in. Squadron
leaders, take flight.

1621
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:54,610
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1622
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:56,737
Eagle One. Fox two.

1623
02:08:56,896 --> 02:08:58,398
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1624
02:09:07,365 --> 02:09:10,710
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1625
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:12,787
Prepare to engage!

1626
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:21,095
All right, Mr. President! Here we go!

1627
02:09:21,254 --> 02:09:23,256
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1628
02:09:25,299 --> 02:09:27,597
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

1629
02:09:29,553 --> 02:09:31,806
Okay. Job's done. Let's go home.

1630
02:09:32,306 --> 02:09:34,104
Gladly.

1631
02:09:37,603 --> 02:09:38,729
What's up?

1632
02:09:39,272 --> 02:09:40,444
It's stuck.

1633
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:42,654
- What?
- It's not responding. It's stuck.

1634
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:44,114
Try it again.

1635
02:09:58,958 --> 02:10:01,302
Come on, come on!

1636
02:10:17,560 --> 02:10:19,358
Come on, come on! Inside!

1637
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,490
- Go to the elevator!
- Hurry!

1638
02:10:33,701 --> 02:10:35,294
Steve! Steve!

1639
02:10:41,167 --> 02:10:43,761
- What are you doing?
- They're overriding the system.

1640
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:46,172
Oh, shit!

1641
02:10:46,339 --> 02:10:48,307
Um... Hide.

1642
02:10:54,347 --> 02:10:56,850
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1643
02:10:57,767 --> 02:10:58,939
Come on in.

1644
02:11:02,646 --> 02:11:04,114
I'm not Jewish.

1645
02:11:04,607 --> 02:11:06,359
Nobody's perfect.

1646
02:11:09,612 --> 02:11:12,161
God! Where are they?

1647
02:11:21,165 --> 02:11:23,634
This could be our last night on Earth.

1648
02:11:26,545 --> 02:11:28,639
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1649
02:11:34,470 --> 02:11:37,644
If we do, we'll both die virgins.

1650
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:40,268
But at least we'll be together.

1651
02:11:48,818 --> 02:11:50,786
Are you scared?

1652
02:11:51,362 --> 02:11:52,488
Me, too.

1653
02:11:54,365 --> 02:11:56,459
- Eagle Seven, fox two.
- Eagle Three, fox two.

1654
02:12:04,500 --> 02:12:08,095
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.

1655
02:12:08,254 --> 02:12:09,847
It's directly over us.

1656
02:12:19,014 --> 02:12:21,358
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon!

1657
02:12:21,517 --> 02:12:24,020
Then let's take it out
before it takes us out.

1658
02:12:29,483 --> 02:12:31,360
Target at 12 o'clock!

1659
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:35,034
My God! They're everywhere!

1660
02:12:36,615 --> 02:12:38,993
- Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
- I see them.

1661
02:12:42,371 --> 02:12:44,669
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1662
02:12:46,333 --> 02:12:48,882
You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!

1663
02:12:52,256 --> 02:12:54,759
I'm in range. Locking on.

1664
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,853
I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!

1665
02:13:07,730 --> 02:13:09,403
That is a negative impact.

1666
02:13:09,565 --> 02:13:11,693
<i>That is an NI. Negative impact.</i>

1667
02:13:12,359 --> 02:13:14,657
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1668
02:13:14,820 --> 02:13:16,367
I'm on it.

1669
02:13:18,782 --> 02:13:20,409
Oh, Jesus!

1670
02:13:22,703 --> 02:13:26,298
- Sir, all missiles have been fired.
- Out of time! Get your ass out of there!

1671
02:13:26,457 --> 02:13:28,835
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1672
02:13:29,001 --> 02:13:30,924
Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?

1673
02:13:31,086 --> 02:13:33,214
<i>Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!</i>

1674
02:13:37,009 --> 02:13:38,386
I got hung up back there!

1675
02:13:38,552 --> 02:13:41,852
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1676
02:13:42,014 --> 02:13:43,516
I'm packing!

1677
02:13:44,934 --> 02:13:47,062
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1678
02:13:47,228 --> 02:13:49,481
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- It's me!

1679
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,274
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>

1680
02:13:52,066 --> 02:13:54,068
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1681
02:13:54,235 --> 02:13:57,284
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>

1682
02:13:57,446 --> 02:14:02,577
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take flanking
positions. Look after this guy, okay?

1683
02:14:03,035 --> 02:14:07,085
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!

1684
02:14:07,248 --> 02:14:09,467
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!

1685
02:14:17,424 --> 02:14:19,392
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1686
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:22,638
Oh-ho! Look out! Coming through!

1687
02:14:24,265 --> 02:14:25,687
I've got tone.

1688
02:14:27,810 --> 02:14:30,359
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1689
02:14:37,528 --> 02:14:39,371
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1690
02:14:42,658 --> 02:14:44,035
It's jammed.

1691
02:14:45,035 --> 02:14:46,878
<i>It won't fire.</i>

1692
02:14:49,999 --> 02:14:51,467
Damn it!

1693
02:15:02,177 --> 02:15:04,271
Do me a favor.

1694
02:15:06,223 --> 02:15:10,069
Tell my children... I love them very much.

1695
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:15,324
All right, you alien assholes!

1696
02:15:16,358 --> 02:15:18,952
In the words of my generation...

1697
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:22,991
...up yours!

1698
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:24,951
Dad! What's he doing?

1699
02:15:25,117 --> 02:15:26,369
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

1700
02:15:26,535 --> 02:15:28,629
Come on, baby, come on!

1701
02:15:31,624 --> 02:15:33,001
Good luck, buddy.

1702
02:15:39,923 --> 02:15:45,726
Hello, boys! I'm back!

1703
02:16:06,742 --> 02:16:08,540
He did it!

1704
02:16:08,702 --> 02:16:10,704
The son of a bitch did it!

1705
02:16:13,707 --> 02:16:14,924
All right!

1706
02:16:37,398 --> 02:16:39,446
What your father did was very brave.

1707
02:16:41,276 --> 02:16:43,119
You should be proud of him.

1708
02:16:43,821 --> 02:16:45,414
I am.

1709
02:17:03,132 --> 02:17:07,353
We know how to take them out, general.
Spread the word.

1710
02:17:10,347 --> 02:17:13,817
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1711
02:17:13,976 --> 02:17:17,230
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1712
02:17:30,993 --> 02:17:32,461
What do you think?

1713
02:17:33,495 --> 02:17:35,873
Checkmate.

1714
02:18:01,315 --> 02:18:04,819
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.

1715
02:18:09,072 --> 02:18:10,540
Thank you.

1716
02:18:18,332 --> 02:18:19,925
It's been a pleasure.

1717
02:18:20,876 --> 02:18:22,844
Steve, you too.

1718
02:18:26,882 --> 02:18:28,725
Only one thing left to do.

1719
02:18:34,515 --> 02:18:36,233
Ready?

1720
02:18:36,391 --> 02:18:38,064
Yes, sir.

1721
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:47,570
Hey, all right! Look at us!

1722
02:18:47,736 --> 02:18:51,081
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1723
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,481
Y'all take care. Nothing
but love for you!

1724
02:18:53,493 --> 02:18:54,244
Goodbye!

1725
02:18:56,078 --> 02:18:58,422
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1726
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:00,958
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!

1727
02:19:08,173 --> 02:19:09,220
Peace!

1728
02:19:23,438 --> 02:19:25,657
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?

1729
02:19:25,816 --> 02:19:27,159
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1730
02:19:27,317 --> 02:19:29,866
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us out of here!

1731
02:19:37,786 --> 02:19:40,255
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?

1732
02:19:48,672 --> 02:19:52,472
- Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop side-seat driving!

1733
02:19:56,305 --> 02:19:58,649
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit left!

1734
02:19:58,807 --> 02:20:01,651
- Where the hell do you think I'm going?
- Okay, okay. We're...

1735
02:20:20,412 --> 02:20:22,665
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!

1736
02:20:22,831 --> 02:20:26,176
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1737
02:20:26,335 --> 02:20:28,633
Aah!

1738
02:20:37,846 --> 02:20:39,189
Oh!

1739
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:41,442
Elvis has left the building!

1740
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,602
Thank <i>you very</i> much.

1741
02:20:43,769 --> 02:20:45,863
Oh, I love you, man.

1742
02:22:16,778 --> 02:22:20,032
They're going down all over the
world, Torn. We got them beat.

1743
02:22:20,198 --> 02:22:22,951
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1744
02:22:26,788 --> 02:22:32,295
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1745
02:22:35,088 --> 02:22:36,135
Hold it!

1746
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:39,472
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1747
02:23:26,681 --> 02:23:28,604
Sorry, sir.

1748
02:23:29,351 --> 02:23:30,603
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1749
02:23:30,769 --> 02:23:33,522
- Well done, captain.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

1750
02:23:41,029 --> 02:23:42,155
David...

1751
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:46,376
Not bad.

1752
02:23:49,538 --> 02:23:52,212
Thank you, Mr. President.

1753
02:23:53,041 --> 02:23:54,884
Not too bad at all.

1754
02:23:56,044 --> 02:23:58,172
Oh, so this is healthy?

1755
02:23:58,630 --> 02:24:00,724
Oh... I could get used to it.

1756
02:24:18,567 --> 02:24:21,116
Happy Fourth of July, Daddy.

1757
02:24:21,278 --> 02:24:23,372
Same to you, Munchkin.

1758
02:24:25,198 --> 02:24:27,542
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

1759
02:24:27,701 --> 02:24:29,078
Yeah.

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:43,120
Wangan Midnight

3
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,169
Asakura!

4
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,159
It is like that car is mad.

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,850
It would run like it was twisting its body.

6
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,500
Those that saw it were destined to go to a single place.

7
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,159
Understood. Please prepare the operation.

8
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,080
Please contact Hayami-sensei. I will be there in 20 minutes.

9
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,460
Yes. Please take care of that.

10
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,759
Work?

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,969
Yeah. My patient has taken a turn for the worse.

12
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,349
I have to go.

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,769
Then, go.

14
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,019
I'm going to stay here a bit longer.

15
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,650
I can't just leave you in the middle of a freeway.

16
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,859
You're right...

17
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,529
A coworker asked me before...

18
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,579
"You're a surgeon, so why risk your life over an obsession with racing?"

19
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,380
I do not really remember my reply to him.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,754
Please let me help!

21
00:02:58,755 --> 00:02:59,424
Who are you?!

22
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:01,264
I'm a doctor at Kounan Hospital! Please!

23
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:02,049
No!

24
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,150
It's my fault he's like this!

25
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,490
Niisan?

26
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,800
Something wrong?

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,929
No.

28
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,349
Those who share fates with that car are unable to shake it off until he destroys himself.

29
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,350
...even for the ones that survive.

30
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,379
Amazing!

31
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,334
This car is pretty fast.

32
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,429
Let's not go home yet.

33
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,294
Really?

34
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,634
We can go to Oozuna.

35
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:01,849
Right, Akio?

36
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,709
What?

37
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,484
See?!

38
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,474
You hear that?

39
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:08,899
He's out of it when he drives. He forgets about everything else.

40
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,409
Does he race other cars?

41
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,044
He's good when he does it.

42
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:17,564
Like he has this battle with a Crimson R. Of course, he won.

43
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:20,064
In the end he got his dace captured by a traffic camera.

44
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:23,289
That's a stain on his school record.

45
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,894
How funny!

46
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:28,444
He got a strict lecture on obeying traffic lights, isn't that unbelievable?

47
00:04:28,445 --> 00:04:33,680
Hey, didn't you guys say you were in college?

48
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,389
No, no. Just... That's fine. Yeah.

49
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,874
I've got it. Let's go to the beach. Alright, Akio?

50
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,634
Let's go. Ma!

51
00:04:41,635 --> 00:04:44,884
Fool! We got the girls to go this far.

52
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:48,559
I'm in high school. You alright with that?

53
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,904
Guess it's fine.

54
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,609
Yeah.

55
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,734
You heard them.

56
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:56,840
Way to go! T-yeah! You're the best!

57
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,049
Fast!

58
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:05,354
Did you see that, Ma?

59
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:06,754
Yeah... a Porsche.

60
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:08,139
It's the Blackbird.

61
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,600
For real? That Blackbird?

62
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
Hey!

63
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,240
Hey! Stop! I don't like this!

64
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,479
Stop it.

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,100
Don't worry.

66
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,149
That signal is an invitation to do a battle.

67
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,609
The moment it's accepted, both cars form a bond.

68
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,659
An invisible, dangerous bond.

69
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,194
I said stop! There's no way they're interested.

70
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,090
Just watch.

71
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,984
Hey... Sorry, but can you let us off?

72
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,654
It's fine!It's fine! We're about to go to the beach.

73
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,659
I fell like I'm going to throw up.

74
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,020
You can throw up all you want at the beach. Yeah.

75
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,389
It probably didn't even last a minute.

76
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,349
That was it for that meeting.

77
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,230
At that time.

78
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:07,240
Oh! So that's why you were so late this morning?

79
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,119
Your opponent was a poor match for you!

80
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,629
Blackbird is on a totally different level.

81
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,209
I knew it.

82
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,584
The black sea bird, the jet-black Porsche Turbo.

83
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:18,429
Many have lost to it at Wangan.

84
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,784
Quit talking about cars so early in the morning, bro!

85
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:25,054
We wouldn't have a place to live without cars in the morning, fool!

86
00:07:25,055 --> 00:07:29,204
Anyway, Akio. I'm not getting the girl from last night's cellphone at all.

87
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,899
Probably because you fed her all those lies.

88
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,279
For real?!

89
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,409
What a laugh!

90
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,449
Give it up, Ma.

91
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,359
Come on.

92
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,880
<i>Thank you.</i>

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,074
Oh, right, Akio.

94
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:51,929
I'm about to go to Kuro-san's. Seems the Z32 is in.

95
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,834
Really?!

96
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:54,674
I'll see if there are any good parts.

97
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,809
I'm going too, Kou-chan!

98
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,839
Hey.
Cutting classes again?

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,384
I'll go in the afternoon. Take care of things.

100
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,689
Damn.

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,304
You're buying me lunch.

102
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:06,900
Right, right.

103
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:22,840
[Teacher speaking]

104
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,549
England?

105
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,754
You're studying abroad, Eriko?

106
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:29,929
It's not set yet. I still need to turn in a letter of recommendation.

107
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,689
But today I turned in my formal application for studying abroad.

108
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,729
Cambridge, right?

109
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,974
That's amazing!

110
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,899
I said it's not set yet.

111
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,609
But you didn't say a thing about it before.

112
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,199
I was going to tell you when I knew.

113
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,074
After all, if I didn't make it, I'd be embarrassed.

114
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,199
Did something happen?

115
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,824
Eh?

116
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:49,494
Were you dumped by your doctor boyfriend?

117
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,629
Nothing happened.

118
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,704
I guess you can say...

119
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:54,919
What?

120
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,379
I need to refresh or...

121
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,930
I need a reset.

122
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,519
Reset?

123
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,680
Yeah.

124
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,324
Hey! Isn't this an awesome find?

125
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,074
Yeah.

126
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:28,084
The frame's undamaged, plus it's got a turbo attached.

127
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,874
Plus it's got no baggage.

128
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:30,914
Great.

129
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,084
Okay, 10 000 yen.

130
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:33,084
That's expensive!

131
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:36,179
Why are you charging so much for something someone threw away?!

132
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,464
Hey, Akio!

133
00:09:37,465 --> 00:09:42,000
Come over here! This is a treasure load!

134
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,359
Hey, Akio!

135
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,329
What are you doing?!

136
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,079
Hey.

137
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,489
The Z is over there.

138
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,869
This is the first Z model.

139
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,839
It's a S30, right?

140
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,709
It's just the castoff skin.

141
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,920
You can't even call this a car no more.

142
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,899
It's got twin turbos!

143
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,739
They cleanly swapped it with an L28 engine!

144
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,784
Slotted rotors. Ride height stabilizers.

145
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:30,289
This is pretty great!

146
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,000
The papers on that Z and its license number.

147
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,169
A three number plate?

148
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,760
Seems like it's official.

149
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,559
What is it, Kuro-san?

150
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,479
Oh... I'm sorry...

151
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,144
Is it really that odd? Did I mess up my perm yesterday?

152
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:48,854
I'm not talking about that, fool!

153
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:49,544
Not this?

154
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:50,514
Look at the name! The name!

155
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:51,064
Name?

156
00:10:51,065 --> 00:10:53,739
Look at the name of the registration.

157
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,609
Asakura Akio!

158
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,434
For real?

159
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,114
That's the same name!

160
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,864
This is impossible!

161
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:01,749
Just to check...

162
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,654
He wasn't the past owner, right?

163
00:11:03,655 --> 00:11:06,379
No. Seems it was a different man.

164
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:11,769
A young man asked us to completely scrap it.

165
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,049
Is it a haunted car?

166
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,009
Yeah.

167
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,679
Kou-chan!

168
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,479
Kou-chan!

169
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,514
I've made my decision.

170
00:11:19,515 --> 00:11:20,519
Huh?

171
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,269
Manager.

172
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,024
Please sell me that cat.

173
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:24,979
What?

174
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,544
Sorry, Akio. That's not for sale.

175
00:11:27,545 --> 00:11:30,739
Are you an idiot?! T-that's just scrap!

176
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,404
Just now you said it was great!

177
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:33,984
That was then! Now is now!

178
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:36,904
Anyway, weren't you working your ass of to buy the Z32, fool!

179
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,499
You!

180
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,089
Eh?!

181
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,379
Is this for real?!

182
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,844
My name's already there!

183
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:44,524
No, no, no! That's not your name!

184
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:46,374
Like you would just happen to own such a weird car!

185
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:49,134
Akio, you should pass on this.

186
00:11:49,135 --> 00:11:50,269
Definitely.

187
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,599
Are you sure?

188
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,224
I think it's saying, "Ride me".

189
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:54,899
Of course not!

190
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,074
At any rate, forget that car! No!

191
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:00,694
We've still got work to discuss.

192
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:05,030
Oh, right. Let's talk about tomorrow.

193
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,494
It is not a particularly unique name.

194
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:13,339
So it is no surprise that he meets someone with the same name.

195
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:19,550
However, this is surely the moment the door of fate opened.

196
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,849
They say something exists within the machines called "cars".

197
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,859
Sometimes, people fear it.

198
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,569
In other times, people are drawn to it.

199
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,894
Oh, she picked up!

200
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,829
Hello! Thanks for yester...

201
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,119
Ah...

202
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,319
I'm sorry. My mistake.

203
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,700
Okay.

204
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,920
I called her brother.

205
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,400
I know you liked this Z...

206
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:44,360
...but I didn't think you'd fall that hard for this one.

207
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,289
I suppose it happened about two years ago...

208
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,249
On Yamashita Street...

209
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,010
I saw a S30Z just like this...

210
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,870
I can remember it clearly even now.

211
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,409
You want to drive it that badly?

212
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,079
Yeah.

213
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,460
Let's fix it, Kou-chan.

214
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,549
If we do it and it doesn't work...

215
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,389
..you're paying me beck for the costs.

216
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,810
Of course! I'll help too.

217
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,204
How many people have owned that car?

218
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,619
I do not know.

219
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,939
All I know... is that in the end, everyone decides to leave it.

220
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,144
It worked hard for us.

221
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,294
How about this?

222
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,590
Okay.

223
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,409
Welcome!

224
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,909
I need car parts, don't you have any?

225
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,209
Eh?

226
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,574
It's okay if it's a bit expensive.

227
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:34,589
It's that S30Z.

228
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,760
I want to know more about it.

229
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,299
Who did it come from?

230
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,269
I have a different part-time job in the day.

231
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,729
I'd like to work at night if possible.

232
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,719
Of course.

233
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,574
Right.

234
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:51,400
Is this okay?

235
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,140
Looks like we brought it back to life.

236
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,094
It's no use. He's not stabilizing.

237
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:23,184
360 joules.

238
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:26,650
Okay. Switching to 360 joules.

239
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,970
Here I go.

240
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,870
He's not stabilizing.

241
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,180
We're done.

242
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,470
Sensei...

243
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,819
I'm sorry.

244
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,479
He passed away.

245
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,049
Death equally comes to all people...

246
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,559
Father!

247
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,910
And the pain of those left behind is also the same.

248
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,264
If valor and kindness is required to be a surgeon...

249
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:19,760
...then my doctor's licence would surely be cancelled.

250
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,610
On that day, there was finally a break after a week of nonstop rain.

251
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,969
Huh?

252
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,179
Huh?

253
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,744
There's no back seat!

254
00:17:40,745 --> 00:17:43,469
That's right. It's a two-seater.

255
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,304
Looks like you'll have to hit on girls in another car from here on.

256
00:17:46,305 --> 00:17:47,944
Hey, is this for real?!

257
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,769
Here's your license.

258
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,729
Now this is your car.

259
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,704
It's still in the same jurisdiction so the number didn't change...

260
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:57,464
...but no one expected the same name to carry over too.

261
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,044
Name? What do you mean?

262
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,060
Ask him for the details.

263
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,009
Shall we try it out tonight?

264
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,570
At Wangan!

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,330
Nice.

266
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,579
Though old, this is pretty fast.

267
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,509
As I thought, this is different.

268
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,729
This Z is amazing.

269
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,910
I can feel it even deep within.

270
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,679
But...

271
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,929
I think I liked the previous car...

272
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,840
This is super awesome.

273
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,489
Hello?

274
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:14,564
Kou?

275
00:19:14,565 --> 00:19:16,369
Oh, Kuro-san. Hello.

276
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,839
I know about that Z.

277
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,534
The previous man named Asakura Akio...

278
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,809
Two years ago... he died in an accident on Wangan.

279
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,179
Eh?

280
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,624
That's not all.

281
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:33,044
The previous owner, and the one before that...

282
00:19:33,045 --> 00:19:36,499
It seems they all gave up that car because of accidents.

283
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,229
Seems it causes accidents to prune the people that drive it.

284
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,070
I'm sure you've heard of Devil Z.

285
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,779
It's that Z.

286
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Devil Z...

287
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,369
Hey!

288
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:59,219
Don't be reckless!

289
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,589
I think that car's no good, after all.

290
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,419
Don't fix it.

291
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,939
Destroy it before anything happenes!

292
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,019
You're too late, Kuro-san.

293
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,549
Eh?

294
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,060
Right now driving down Wangan...

295
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,110
...is that devil.

296
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,609
That's...!

297
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,190
It can't be!

298
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,164
You overdid it for the first run, Akio!

299
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,164
Ease into it, This car is...

300
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,784
I know!

301
00:21:07,785 --> 00:21:09,279
Okay. I'm going.

302
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,450
Okay.

303
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,930
He's really stepping on the throttle!

304
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,530
Why are we getting so much attention?

305
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,910
Hey!

306
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,324
They're probably staring at your freaky perm, bro!

307
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:41,610
Hey! Open up, bro. Hey? Bro?

308
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,510
It's Devil Z.

309
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,030
I'm sorry. Pardon me!

310
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,219
Was he waiting for that car?

311
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,789
Or was that car waiting for him?

312
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,129
It had the mysterious power to survive those immeasurable risks.

313
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,189
Only they know the magic of that meeting...

314
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:29,669
Yes, that Z really is...

315
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:32,110
...a devil.

316
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,849
Hey, Asakura.

317
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,849
I told you before.

318
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,914
You won't be able to graduate at this rate.

319
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:04,069
Your grades would be good... if only you came to class.

320
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,939
Properly get tested.

321
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,569
In your case, you don''t get bad grades.

322
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,654
But your attendance is very low.

323
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:17,104
It makes me not want to help you.

324
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:18,499
I'm sorry.

325
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,589
I'll give a final chance.

326
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,839
Come to school for the two weeks between tomorrow to the graduaion ceremony.

327
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,539
If you do that, you'll graduate, Okay?

328
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,454
Thank you very much.

329
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:33,479
Okay.

330
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,564
But I probably can't.

331
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:36,659
Huh?

332
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,699
I'm sorry for being so selfish, Sensei.

333
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,909
You're really...

334
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,029
... a steange guy to the very end.

335
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,409
Fine.

336
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:48,829
So what do you want to do?

337
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,089
Repeat your classes? Drop out?

338
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,460
I'll see you next year.

339
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,389
Okay. Got it.

340
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,584
High school drivers are fresh out of school.

341
00:24:01,585 --> 00:24:02,884
I'm taking my leave.
High school drivers are fresh out of school.

342
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:03,014
Okay, good luck.
High school drivers are fresh out of school.

343
00:24:03,015 --> 00:24:03,874
Okay, good luck.

344
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:08,269
They've all had bad experiences with cars or bikes.

345
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,609
But he was different.

346
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,620
I don't know anymore who says anything bad about him.

347
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,344
Shimada-sensei.

348
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:20,804
Yes.

349
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:25,919
This is for that boy. Sensei, you will be in charge of him next year.

350
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,780
Please take care of him.

351
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,929
His parents got a divorce three years ago.

352
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,639
His father started a construction company.

353
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,089
His mother is a fashion designer.

354
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,399
The divorce could have been a handicap, but it didn't have a negative impact on his life.

355
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,289
If not for the fact he spent most of his days devoted to cars...

356
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,509
No way!

357
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,529
So it's that Z's fault?

358
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,614
Working like a fool day and night...

359
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:58,669
Finally forcing you to repeat classes next year.

360
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,589
That's fine. The double can be fun too.

361
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,589
Poor fellow. I'm going to college and seeing a ton of cute girls.

362
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,219
Of you're lucky.

363
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,979
But... I didn't think you'd be doing doubles.

364
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,399
Considering your character.

365
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,280
I suppose you're right.

366
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,069
You coming tonight? To Wangan?

367
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,759
Yeah.

368
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,309
I'm going.

369
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:29,459
Bro didn't say anything, but that Z...

370
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,689
...it killed someone.

371
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:34,620
The man with the same name as yours.

372
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,464
So what?!

373
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:38,464
That car is dangerous!

374
00:25:38,465 --> 00:25:40,329
That was then.

375
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,369
Now it's my Z.

376
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:44,539
Out compatibility is perfect.

377
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,310
Hey, it's not my fault if anything happens to you.

378
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,609
Ah.

379
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,154
You be careful too.

380
00:25:52,155 --> 00:25:53,029
Eh?

381
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,399
Tobacco.

382
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,490
If you're caught now, you won't be able to graduate.

383
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,180
Asakura-kun.

384
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,689
You live alone, right?

385
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:17,480
If you have any problems, fell free to talk to me.

386
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,269
Ummm...

387
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,109
Who are you?

388
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,819
I will be in charge of you starting next month. I'm Shimada.

389
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,569
I appreciate it, but I don't have any problems.

390
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,870
Later.

391
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,929
I fixed it up just as you told me.

392
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,559
This was a last minute tune-up though...

393
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,440
So please just don't be reckless with it, Shima-chan.

394
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,360
I am terribly sorry for rushing you.

395
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,029
So... you know people have seen that car at Wangan.

396
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,239
Yes.

397
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,334
I know.

398
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,499
Have you encountered it?

399
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,769
No. Not yet.

400
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,550
Everyone's freaked. The number's even the same. They think it's a ghost.

401
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,349
I will check for myself to see if it is a ghost.

402
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:26,199
Don't tell me... this tune-up was so you can race that Z?!

403
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,560
Thank you very much, Manager.

404
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,959
Cheers.

405
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,244
Eriko, happy birthday.

406
00:27:48,245 --> 00:27:51,610
Thank you.

407
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,889
You should have had Tatsuya-san come.

408
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,519
He has the night shift tonight.

409
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,149
I see. Doctors sure have a rough time.

410
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,269
Looks like it.

411
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,029
When will you get the response about traveling abroad?

412
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,199
Ummm... next week, I think.

413
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,659
I see.

414
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,789
I hope you get it.

415
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,449
It'll be okay.

416
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,829
I'm sure Eriko will be fine.

417
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,210
You're right.

418
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,680
Oniichan liked this dish, didn't he?

419
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,164
Yes?

420
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:58,414
Oh, Reina.

421
00:28:58,415 --> 00:29:01,139
I finally got you. Where are you now?

422
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,134
Right now... I'm at a convenient store near my home.

423
00:29:04,135 --> 00:29:06,924
So... about tomorrow's schedule...

424
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:10,784
Be at Shiminate Studio at eight, right? You told me many times already.

425
00:29:10,785 --> 00:29:13,529
As long as you know.

426
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,484
Sorry.

427
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:17,990
Okay. I'm hanging up.

428
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,540
Damn...

429
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,320
For real?!

430
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,039
Driving at over 200 Km/h...

431
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,380
...the other cars would look like they're standing still.

432
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:09,510
Amazing...

433
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:26,079
If it is really a devil... then maybe permanently destroying it isn't possible...

434
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,119
But... I have to try...

435
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,370
...before it's too late.

436
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:04,460
I was hoping we'd meet.

437
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,570
Okay!

438
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,199
Eh?

439
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,909
Devil Z and Blackbird?!

440
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,694
What's Devil Z?

441
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:13,649
This is amazing...

442
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,050
It's the revival of the legendary battle.

443
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,420
What a car is this?

444
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,094
It wasn't just the car.

445
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:40,339
The driving style... the aura it emitted... not a single thing was different.

446
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,030
It was all the same as back then...

447
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,300
Why?

448
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:05,889
Why...?

449
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:11,584
That Z... almost as if it has a will of its own... would sometimes reject its driver.

450
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:15,740
And plunge itself into the path of destruction.

451
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,114
Hello?

452
00:34:18,115 --> 00:34:19,944
Bro? Akio was in an accident.

453
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:20,364
What?

454
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:22,844
Seems he's at Minato Central Hospital. Come ASAP! I'll be going first.

455
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:25,620
Okay, okay!

456
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,009
Akio! Are you okay?!

457
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:34,829
Yeah.

458
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:37,379
You got hit in the head? Do you know me?

459
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,849
Eh?

460
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,754
Who are you?

461
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:42,060
Eh?!

462
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,689
I'm joking. I'm fine.

463
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,779
I told you that car was dangerous!

464
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:53,660
You're going to give up that Z, right?

465
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,879
He left already.

466
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,589
He left?

467
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,579
Then he wasn't badly hurt?

468
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,469
Right. He just had some stitches on his head.

469
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,350
Thank you very much.

470
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,939
I bore no grudge against that man.

471
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,659
No... You could say I was trying to save him.

472
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:28,620
At any rate, now he can separate himself from the devil.

473
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,579
Here, coffee.

474
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,094
Oh. Thank you very much, Sensei.

475
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:51,094
Quit it with that "sensei" stuff.

476
00:36:51,095 --> 00:36:53,890
Ishida-sensei.

477
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,324
Oh, right.

478
00:36:55,325 --> 00:37:00,239
On last week's blog you wrote that you encountered Devil Z at Wangan, right?

479
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,739
Yeah.

480
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,909
So how was it?

481
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,409
It lasted only a moment.

482
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:09,259
I was going at 180 but he still quickly overtook me.

483
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,204
I've heard rumors, but I never paid much attention to them.

484
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:17,814
They seemed like lies. Anyway, there's no way such an old Z would be that fast.

485
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:22,009
And yet, in reality it still surpassed your pride and joy GT-R.

486
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,479
yes, I felt like someone was screwing with me.

487
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,439
But in the end, the Z got in another accident.

488
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,624
Wasn't me. We only met for a moment.

489
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,189
I know that.

490
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,369
90 percent of the time his opponent is Blackbird.

491
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,079
Blackbird?

492
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,999
I suppose you can say he's the previous Z's owner's rival or friend or something.

493
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,344
Have you met him, Sensei?

494
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,249
Oh, of course.

495
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,420
Both Devil Z's and Blackbird's drivers.

496
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,639
That kind of excites me.

497
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,384
So you've fallen victim to Z's spell too?

498
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,059
Me "too"?

499
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,269
You've made the same mistake as me.

500
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,859
No way.

501
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,654
Sensei, can you look at this.

502
00:38:05,655 --> 00:38:07,234
Oh. Alright.

503
00:38:07,235 --> 00:38:08,659
Sensei.

504
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:12,279
Will that Z return again to Wangan?

505
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,159
Without a doubt.

506
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,460
It is a devil, after all.

507
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,670
Reina!

508
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,099
Cut down on your racing at Wangan.

509
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,299
Eh?

510
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,099
Huh?

511
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,599
You were lying about being at the convenience store before, weren't you?

512
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,309
Was I? I forget.

513
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,319
Man...

514
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,190
And don't write about cars on your blog.

515
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,904
Why? You said I could write about anything I wanted.

516
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,159
Listen.

517
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,459
This is an important time for you now.

518
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,079
This is your chance to get that part on the drama I told you about before.

519
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,919
This can decide whether you stay just a gravure model or become an actress.

520
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,679
But... I am myself!

521
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,099
Oh, Kaga-chan.

522
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,750
Oh, Ossan! Always a pleasure!

523
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:14,489
Akikawa-san. If you'd please.

524
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,820
Okay.

525
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,409
Akikawa-san entering.

526
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:23,710
Let's get along.

527
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,209
You okay?

528
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,509
Ah. Yes.

529
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,050
Alright. Shall we go?

530
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,749
I knew it.

531
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,080
Kou-chan!

532
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,260
I thought it was weird to not see you coming by.

533
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,124
I was wondering why.

534
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:14,229
I didn't want to be a bother to you. Kou-chan.

535
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,150
I'll handle it myself somehow.

536
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,700
You'll still drive it even if I tried to stop you, right?

537
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,950
So let me watch as long as I can.

538
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,660
Give me that.

539
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,879
Kou-chan!

540
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,709
Don't just stand there, help me remove this.

541
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,010
Okay.

542
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,890
Hello.

543
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:47,439
I'm at a family restaurant having omelette rice.

544
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,019
I felt a bit hungry.

545
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,184
Yes, Nine o'clock, right?

546
00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:53,434
I know.

547
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:57,740
Okay. Good night.

548
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,370
I'm not your pet dog!

549
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,760
Get lost, asshole!

550
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,999
Devil Z and Blackbird...

551
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,099
Sounds fun!

552
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,019
Neither gender nor class matter on the Wangan at night.

553
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,320
Everyone is racing here... because they seek something.

554
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,024
You leave May 28th.

555
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:33,654
Be sure to attend the guidance meeting next week.

556
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:34,749
Yes.

557
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,324
Thank you very much.

558
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:38,459
Way to go, Eriko!

559
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,460
Hey, international student! Prince Williams is waiting!

560
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,419
That's great that you got it.

561
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,019
Yeah.

562
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,769
I applied late, so it was during a period of low interest.

563
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,859
I'm leaving next month.

564
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,779
I see.

565
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,279
I'll be lonely.

566
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,319
You lie.

567
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,859
Not so.

568
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,490
I wonder?

569
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,959
You'll be able to forget.

570
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,330
...everything perhaps.

571
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,790
Yeah.

572
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,759
Shall we go on a little trip?

573
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,009
It's been a while since I went with you, Eriko.

574
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,590
That'd be nice.

575
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,779
Welcome!

576
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,814
A full tank of high octane.

577
00:42:33,815 --> 00:42:36,159
Understood.

578
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,494
Full tank!

579
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:38,494
Oh, I'll do it.

580
00:42:38,495 --> 00:42:39,339
Oh, please do.

581
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,440
Okay.

582
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,880
The car's image is truly different in the day.

583
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,050
At night, she truly looks like a black sea bird.

584
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,430
Hello!

585
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,400
Who is he?

586
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,870
I raced him at Wangan before...

587
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,660
..he was driving your brother's Z.

588
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,580
Here.

589
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:26,380
And sign here please.

590
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,849
Asakura?

591
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,889
Yeah.

592
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,310
My name's Asakura Akio.

593
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,570
It can't be...

594
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,490
What's wrong?

595
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,220
Is she okay?

596
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,590
Yeah.

597
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,349
She's his little sister?

598
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,559
Then it was the Z from that time!

599
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,029
Eh?

600
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,399
I happened to see them in the city before.

601
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,369
She was in the Z.

602
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:19,154
Your story sounds like fate.

603
00:44:19,155 --> 00:44:22,209
But to be honest, I don't care about that.

604
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,539
Right now, all I care about is driving it.

605
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,379
Don't tell me... you still plan to drive it?

606
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,929
Of course! Now is now.

607
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:34,679
Don't take this the wrong way.

608
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,679
Ditch that car. It's beyond your control.

609
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,269
Everyone says the same thing, don't they?

610
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,729
That Z... will kill you.

611
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:47,940
How do you know?

612
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,199
Because I've always watched that Z.

613
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:54,040
...before you drove it.

614
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,500
Could it be... you're the one that submitted it to Kuro-san's plant?

615
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,519
Two or three more days.

616
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,480
And I can race with it again.

617
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,939
Wednesday night.

618
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,819
I'll be waiting at east Ichigawa.

619
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,049
Are you serious?

620
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:25,119
Yeah!

621
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,950
Next time for sure, I'm bringing down this Blackbird!

622
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:03,744
You're facing that Blackbird again?

623
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:04,709
Yeah.

624
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,414
I've got a feeling I'll win this time.

625
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:09,834
I want nothing to do with it if you die this time.

626
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:12,259
I'm telling you that I'll be fine.

627
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,799
More importantly...

628
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,549
...have you gotten a girlfriend in college?

629
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,769
Yeah.

630
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:20,020
I was dumped two times already.

631
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,499
I'm sorry. Looks like we never got around to that trip.

632
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,999
It's fine.

633
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,404
You really want to get off here?

634
00:46:38,405 --> 00:46:42,090
Yeah. I'm visiting a friend.

635
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,390
Bye.

636
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:02,914
Good work.

637
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:05,990
Yeah. Good work!

638
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,510
You!

639
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,139
I asked your boss.

640
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,269
He told me the answer after I said we were siblings.

641
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,780
We had the same last name, so he didn't suspect anything.

642
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:35,570
What do you want from me?

643
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,240
Nothing.

644
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,540
Z...

645
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:46,170
Can I see it?

646
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:09,319
Your hairstyle is completely different.

647
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,279
Eh?

648
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,910
Before, you has it tied in the back.

649
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,840
What are you talking about?

650
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,000
It's nothing.

651
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,140
The same as my brother...

652
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,650
It's not just the name...

653
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,069
Working a bunch of part-time jobs...

654
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,859
And staying all night working on this Z.

655
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,199
Those that like cars all act the same.

656
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,830
Everyone said...

657
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:51,420
...this car is dangerous.

658
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,339
I heard about your older brother.

659
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,879
But that's got nothing to do with me.

660
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,049
This car is no good.

661
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:00,084
I'm sure you an my brother...

662
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:03,390
Sorry, but I'm not your brother!

663
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,310
It's true this may be a dangerous car.

664
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,360
But this is the one I want.

665
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:15,860
Even those words are the same.

666
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,529
Why does it have to be this car?!

667
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:21,324
Why does it have to be this Z?! Tell me!

668
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,330
I don't know!

669
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,960
Even if I did... I'm sure I couldn't explain it to someone else.

670
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:34,220
I'm leaving.

671
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:53,740
Hey!

672
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:01,290
You're welcome to ride with me on Wednesday.

673
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,440
Eh?

674
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:12,560
You might learn why your brother was so interested in the Z.

675
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:23,200
I don't want to ride in a car that causes accidents.

676
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,259
Devil Z's resurrection.

677
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,519
Some feared it...

678
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,730
Others waited for it with bated breath.

679
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,869
And then...

680
00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:00,990
35 days since that battle...

681
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:15,849
Pressure okay.

682
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,139
Temperature okay.

683
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:19,939
Hydro okay.

684
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,060
Okay, Z!

685
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,829
Oh, he's doing pretty well.

686
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:38,460
Great!

687
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,010
What were you doing?

688
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,649
In the end, you fixed it all be yourself.

689
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,609
Alright! I won't kick this Z anymore!

690
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,449
Thank you, Kou-chan.

691
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,279
So tomorrow you're finally getting your revenge?

692
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,779
I'm definitely going to win.

693
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,039
I'll watch.

694
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,000
May I join in?

695
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,509
I've been waiting all this time for Devil Z to return.

696
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:22,180
Where have I seen that face before?

697
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:25,939
Ah. Eh?

698
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,390
In person?!

699
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,589
But I guess I won't this time.

700
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:35,699
It's be bad to interrupt a faded battle.

701
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:40,240
I'll race you now if you have time.

702
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:43,419
What a pity, but I don't have time.

703
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:48,590
I have to go to the studio and say today's weather.

704
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,559
Don't get in an accident this time, I want you to race me next.

705
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,849
Yeah.

706
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,560
I'll be waiting. Anytime!

707
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:15,614
That was Akikawa Reina, right?

708
00:53:15,615 --> 00:53:18,159
Eh? The actual one? You know her? Hey.

709
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,534
Thank goodness it's not midsummer or I'd think she's gone nuts.

710
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,969
Or am I nuts right now?

711
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:33,189
The butterfly flowed like a small piece of trash. It flew alone.

712
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:36,584
The train used to travel making a loud noise.

713
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:42,569
The stressed passengers slept peacefully, like they had forgotten where they were going.

714
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:44,849
So he's not been coming?

715
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,419
Right.

716
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,369
What a problem.

717
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:54,210
At this rate, he should have just dropped out of school.

718
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:00,260
Thank you very much!

719
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:05,429
A refreshing present from the country of black team.

720
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:06,804
Tea Story.

721
00:54:06,805 --> 00:54:10,060
I'm addicted to this flavor.

722
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,579
Shima-sensei.

723
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,040
This evening we're going drinking with the night shift. Wan to come with us?

724
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,179
We know an all-night shop.

725
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,799
Seems it has a lot of young folk, I hear it's great.

726
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,679
I'm sorry. I can't today.

727
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,049
I'm driving.

728
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:37,430
Is that so? Okay then.

729
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,770
Wednesday night! I'll be waiting at east Ichigawa!

730
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,274
He's handsome... but he's a bit too cold.

731
00:54:49,275 --> 00:54:50,409
No.

732
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,450
That's what's good about him.

733
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,750
Shima-sensei. Please answer outside line number three.

734
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,250
Hello? This is Shima.

735
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,800
Eriko?

736
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,470
You're... racing tonight, aren't you?

737
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,594
Akio-kun, can you take care of that too.

738
00:55:12,595 --> 00:55:15,560
Alright, I'll get right to it.

739
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,839
Akio.

740
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,079
There's an older woman up there.

741
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,400
Huh?

742
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,139
What is it, Sensei?!

743
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,759
The new semester started almost a month ago.

744
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:43,219
I haven't seen you once.

745
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,890
Is that right?

746
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,869
You work day and night...

747
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:03,459
...and spend the rest of your time on this?

748
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,880
So that's why you don't have time to go to school.

749
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,679
Okay. Let's go.

750
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,099
Eh?

751
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,009
I want to see.

752
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:21,519
What is this world you're absorbed into it prevents you from going to school?

753
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,439
I'm sorry, Sensei.

754
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,144
I'll go to school soon.

755
00:56:25,145 --> 00:56:27,699
Hey, Asakura-kun.

756
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,739
You were the one who chose to remain in school, right?

757
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,699
For now, please just leave me alone tonight.

758
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,369
I can't.

759
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:38,324
This is a formal teacher's visit.

760
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:41,290
Hurry and get out!

761
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:48,760
Please, Sensei. I just can't tonight.

762
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:02,800
I won't say anything if you make a promise to me.

763
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,290
Come to school tomorrow.

764
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,039
Okay.

765
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,870
Be on time in the morning.

766
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:15,380
I promise.

767
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,589
Really?

768
00:57:21,590 --> 00:57:23,850
Yeah.

769
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,979
If you go straight down that street...

770
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,820
...you can get a taxi.

771
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:00,390
Did he ask you?

772
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,769
Eh?

773
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,070
To ride in his Z?

774
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,780
No.

775
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,269
Hey.

776
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:32,979
Hey.

777
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,764
What are you doing?

778
00:58:33,765 --> 00:58:37,014
I've got to get Akikawa Reina's signature!

779
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:41,150
How ma,y times must I tell you?! She's not coming, fool!

780
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,904
Hey, they're here.

781
00:58:46,905 --> 00:58:48,084
Eh? No way! Reina-chan?

782
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:50,690
No!

783
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:02,514
She's cute!

784
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:04,929
You're sick.

785
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,899
Wangan has oil on it from Hanedai to Yokohane.

786
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,609
How about having the bay bridge be the goal?

787
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,940
Okay.

788
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,329
Get in...

789
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,920
...my Z.

790
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,180
Do what you want.

791
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:40,600
But I won't be responsible if you get in that car.

792
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:08,794
We're going to suddenly lose sight of them like this.

793
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:10,424
I'm counting on you, bro.

794
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:12,229
Leave it to me.

795
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:12,974
Here.

796
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:15,480
What are you doing?!

797
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,559
I understand your feelings very well.

798
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:50,649
Riding your brother's beloved car.

799
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:53,109
You want to get closer to his feelings, right?

800
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:57,199
But... you won't feel anything from that.

801
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,280
Because it is a devil.

802
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,099
Stop already.

803
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,879
I can't! I don't understand!

804
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,900
Take a good, hard look. See if this Z is a devil or not.

805
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:32,869
I won't accept that is a devil.

806
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,499
Sorry.

807
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,370
But Blackbird's streak is ending today!

808
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:50,140
You can't...

809
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,649
This Z will surely betray you.

810
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:57,034
Niisan loved it so much, yet this car betrayed him!

811
01:01:57,035 --> 01:01:58,319
No!

812
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:03,570
It's not at fault! Your brother died from his own mistake!

813
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,699
Are you okay?

814
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,659
I told you...

815
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:20,420
This car obeys no one.

816
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,224
Hey, can you walk?!

817
01:03:26,225 --> 01:03:26,894
I'm fine.

818
01:03:26,895 --> 01:03:27,894
You're not hurt, are you?

819
01:03:27,895 --> 01:03:28,374
Yeah.

820
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:30,394
You almost gave me a heart attack!

821
01:03:30,395 --> 01:03:33,684
This car's no good, after all! It's too dangerous!

822
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:34,684
It's dangerous.

823
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:37,269
You're wrong.

824
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:40,189
It didn't betray me.

825
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:43,240
This was my driving mistake.

826
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,160
That's all.

827
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,979
So...

828
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:08,520
Guess I'll have to get my revenge another day.

829
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,670
You hurt?

830
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:41,920
The left side of Wangan line to starting become congested.

831
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:50,030
Stand.

832
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,450
Bow.

833
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,130
Sit.

834
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,049
I see a new student.

835
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,970
Maybe he's a transfer student?

836
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:11,350
Okay, class has started. Open to page 46.

837
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,899
Wangan, eh?

838
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,309
Well.

839
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:21,110
It's not against the law, so I won't tell you to stop.

840
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:26,079
But... don't get in any more accidents.

841
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,949
I'm sorry.

842
01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:31,709
You're surprisingly not honest about your feelings.

843
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:37,679
I decided to remain in school because I hadn't found my answer.

844
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,759
Are you talking about cars?

845
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,849
Or...

846
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:45,270
...your divorced parents?

847
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,100
Maybe everything.

848
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,899
It's a lot of things.

849
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,609
Well, for now, I'm focusing on her.

850
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,779
Her?

851
01:05:55,780 --> 01:06:00,870
Oh no. When referring to my car I call it "her".

852
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,419
That's fine.

853
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,789
Take your time and think it over.

854
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:11,550
Let me know if you need repairs for accidents or have any problems.

855
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,639
You're underage.

856
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,809
You don't want your parents to find out, right?

857
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:21,770
You're the first teacher that I've ever heard say something like that.

858
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:24,569
It's because I also raced a lot.

859
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,359
It's not like I don't understand the interest.

860
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,359
Do you drive too, Sensei?

861
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,200
I'm an expert.

862
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:35,959
But this was many years ago.

863
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,830
Be sure to keep showing up.

864
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:43,300
Oh, Sensei.

865
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,339
Sensei...

866
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,099
What's your name? Shimada...?

867
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,390
Rumi.

868
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:54,439
Let me warn you, don't call me by my first name.

869
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:59,690
I am a teacher, you are a student. Understood?

870
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:01,569
Roger!

871
01:07:01,570 --> 01:07:02,604
Rumi-chan!

872
01:07:02,605 --> 01:07:05,160
I told you, don't!

873
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:25,559
I honestly was surprised when he told me it was you who first found the Z.

874
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:31,400
He decided to drive it when he saw how enchanted you were with that Z.

875
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:54,430
Akikawa Reina-sama. If you'd please.

876
01:07:56,350 --> 01:08:00,479
Playing the role of Kawamura Saki. I'm Akikawa Reina.

877
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,804
I'll do my best, so please check it out.

878
01:08:03,805 --> 01:08:05,934
She's someone to pay attention to.

879
01:08:05,935 --> 01:08:06,779
Yes.

880
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:11,314
Akikawa Reina-san is appearing a drama, it's her first acting role.

881
01:08:11,315 --> 01:08:12,194
That's right.

882
01:08:12,195 --> 01:08:17,454
People may know Akikawa-san from her gravure shots and CM's.

883
01:08:17,455 --> 01:08:22,664
With this drama she will start as an actress.

884
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,624
Let's roll after the Roppongi interview.

885
01:08:25,625 --> 01:08:27,384
Then the appointment for the photobook and DVD.

886
01:08:27,385 --> 01:08:30,719
After that, S Channel's Sakuma-san...

887
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,940
Reina, are you listening?

888
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,729
Yes.

889
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,269
Or, right.

890
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:40,734
I got a call this morning. The CM role is pretty much confirmed.

891
01:08:40,735 --> 01:08:41,644
Really?!

892
01:08:41,645 --> 01:08:42,944
That's amazing!

893
01:08:42,945 --> 01:08:44,699
Isn't that great, Reina?

894
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:45,949
Yes.

895
01:08:45,950 --> 01:08:48,864
We should update the blog as soon as possible.

896
01:08:48,865 --> 01:08:50,824
More people will access it.

897
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:53,929
If you're busy, I'll write it.

898
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:54,629
Eh?

899
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,089
He also does other blogs.

900
01:08:57,090 --> 01:08:59,429
It's sweet playing a girl.

901
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:04,470
And for the next interview... say something like this.

902
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:09,979
When one is losing oneself, they lose sight of the road.

903
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:13,489
There is no light for them.

904
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:16,070
What is this?!

905
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,639
If a car has a mind...

906
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:31,470
...then those little accidents might have been some message.

907
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:35,219
I don't know about the smaller parts, but overall nothing's wrong.

908
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,984
Well, this car is decades old.

909
01:09:37,985 --> 01:09:39,974
This is excellent for its age.

910
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,649
You even held your own against that Blackbird.

911
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:45,780
Yeah.

912
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,529
If you're worried, then we'll have to give it a complete overhaul.

913
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,780
But it's not going to be an easy job.

914
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:40,300
The engine seems heavy. Is it just my imagination?

915
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:45,310
So? When's out next match?

916
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,949
Eriko will be gone soon.

917
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,569
Eh?

918
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:00,990
She's studying abroad in England... for two years.

919
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,209
I see...

920
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:06,289
I suppose it's a bother for you...

921
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:11,420
...but she sees her dead brother in you.

922
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:18,140
When he drove, was he faster that this 911?

923
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:19,889
Why are you asking?

924
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:22,310
No real reason.

925
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:27,279
I'm just wondering if she's rejecting me.

926
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,029
Sometimes the thought crosses my mind.

927
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:33,289
Maybe it just wanted to continue sleeping.

928
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:36,039
Without being bothered by anyone.

929
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,879
Maybe it wishes to be dismantled.

930
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,460
Just like you tried to do.

931
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,099
I'm relieved.

932
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:50,219
So you finally fell like giving it up?

933
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,389
No.

934
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,849
Sorry, but I feel the opposite way.

935
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,269
It makes me like it more...

936
01:11:56,270 --> 01:12:01,440
It makes me want to know about her. Makes me want to hear her voice.

937
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,279
In actuality, you're the same as me, right?

938
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,000
You're also addicted to this Z's speed.

939
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,709
Right?

940
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,920
I will say it one more time!

941
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:18,720
Ditch that Z!

942
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,144
Maybe he's right.

943
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:34,104
Just like him... no more that that...

944
01:12:34,105 --> 01:12:38,820
Maybe I too was entranced with Devil Z.

945
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,244
This time we're joined with Akikawa Reina-chan.

946
01:12:43,245 --> 01:12:45,414
So, Reina-chan, your hobby is cars?

947
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:51,779
Yes. Like after work I'll go for a drive.

948
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,434
Rumors are that you're a racer.

949
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:56,104
Eh? That's not so at all.

950
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,464
Going at high speeds is scary.

951
01:12:58,465 --> 01:13:01,344
If I got in an accident, I wouldn't be able to face my fans.

952
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:02,844
I see.

953
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:06,559
So what is your biggest interest right now?

954
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,849
Ummm... cooking, perhaps?

955
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:14,940
When will this air today again?

956
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:36,980
Damn it... it really isn't working.

957
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:47,370
Is that you, Sensei?

958
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:52,470
Good evening.

959
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:56,879
I bought it on my way here.

960
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,840
Please have this.

961
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:03,970
I'll leave it here.

962
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,730
Didn't you settle things last time?

963
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:12,900
Doesn't coming here just bring up bad memories?

964
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,659
Maybe...

965
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:19,530
Well, I don't mind.

966
01:14:23,410 --> 01:14:25,880
I'm leaving.

967
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:30,880
Goodbye.

968
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,920
Get in.

969
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,930
Where's your home?

970
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,229
Isogo.

971
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,309
This is a detour, but...

972
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:17,440
I'll take you there via Wangan.

973
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:20,810
Okay?

974
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,620
Yeah.

975
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:42,599
Yes?

976
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,219
Tatsita-kun?

977
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,689
I'm sorry for calling so late.

978
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:49,439
Is Eriko with you right now?

979
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,520
Eh?

980
01:15:58,200 --> 01:15:59,574
So your hobby is cars?

981
01:15:59,575 --> 01:16:00,444
Yes.

982
01:16:00,445 --> 01:16:05,204
But I just like to go on a drive after work.

983
01:16:05,205 --> 01:16:07,334
There's a rumor that  you're a racer.

984
01:16:07,335 --> 01:16:09,579
Eh? Not at all.

985
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:15,674
High speeds are scary. I wouldn't be able to face my fans if I got in an accident.

986
01:16:15,675 --> 01:16:18,594
So what are you most into right now?

987
01:16:18,595 --> 01:16:21,974
Ummm... cooking, I suppose?

988
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:24,934
How surprising. You never mention it on your blog.

989
01:16:24,935 --> 01:16:26,024
Is that so?

990
01:16:26,025 --> 01:16:28,199
So what's your specialty?

991
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,239
Ummm...

992
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,949
Meat and potatoes.

993
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:33,334
Yes.

994
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:33,494
Nice! I want to try that!
Yes.

995
01:16:33,495 --> 01:16:35,369
Nice! I want to try that!

996
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:37,929
Right now?

997
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,460
Right now...

998
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:44,380
...I'm driving at 180 km/h on Wangan.

999
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:10,790
Ishida-sensei...

1000
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:26,019
Many kinds of people gather at Wangan.

1001
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:28,609
One person goes to yell out something.

1002
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:33,109
Another goes to forget something.

1003
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:38,320
I can only be me when I'm racing here.

1004
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:43,959
You'll do fine as long as you don't lose sight of yourself.

1005
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:46,750
That's what I do.

1006
01:17:51,470 --> 01:17:53,780
Z.

1007
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:56,760
Sure you don't want to meet up with it?

1008
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,520
I'm fine.

1009
01:18:00,520 --> 01:18:05,190
I'll beat you next time when I'm in my best form.

1010
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,900
I look forward to it.

1011
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,839
Sensei.

1012
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,009
Thank you very much.

1013
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,089
See you later.

1014
01:18:24,090 --> 01:18:25,929
At the studio?

1015
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:28,970
Or here?

1016
01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:32,020
Both!

1017
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:50,040
I'm the one who killed Niisan.

1018
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:55,500
If only I hadn't found this Z...

1019
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,379
Forget it!

1020
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:59,840
Maybe forget all of it.

1021
01:19:13,290 --> 01:19:14,999
This it?

1022
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,320
Yeah.

1023
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:47,724
Can I stay here...

1024
01:19:47,725 --> 01:19:50,530
...a bit longer?

1025
01:19:52,870 --> 01:19:56,000
Today's my last day.

1026
01:20:19,190 --> 01:20:21,929
She said she wanted to remain a bit longer.

1027
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:24,619
Sorry.

1028
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:26,830
It's okay.

1029
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,130
Eriko!

1030
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,220
Get in!

1031
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:06,170
She still has her brother's key.

1032
01:21:12,090 --> 01:21:15,390
Today's the last day...

1033
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:43,260
Where is she going?!

1034
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,689
End...

1035
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:56,980
It can't be...

1036
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,460
Go!

1037
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:30,530
Why...

1038
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:34,730
Why is Tatsuya saving the devil?!

1039
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:43,529
I'm sure she wanted to bring an end to it all.

1040
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:48,539
The car you loved took the life of a person you loved more.

1041
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,579
Your love turned to hatred.

1042
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:57,510
Until you cut yourself free from this fate, you cannot forget those memories.

1043
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,980
I'm sorry.

1044
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:12,739
Forgive me. This was all I could do.

1045
01:24:12,740 --> 01:24:15,199
When are you leaving Japan?

1046
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:16,869
Eh?

1047
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:19,239
The night before that day...

1048
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:22,080
...ride with me again.

1049
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:25,290
Why?

1050
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,750
This is not where it's supposed to die.

1051
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:36,680
You'll join me, right?

1052
01:24:37,730 --> 01:24:38,979
Yeah.

1053
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:40,349
Let's settle this.

1054
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,770
This time for sure.

1055
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:47,240
We'll prepare the greatest place to die.

1056
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:56,789
Eriko tried to consign that car and reset everything.

1057
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:59,879
But he had an exact opposite approach.

1058
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:06,010
He wanted to give Z's greatest race to her as a farewell gift.

1059
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,139
It's a 100 turbo, so the settings will be hard.

1060
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:11,640
I know.

1061
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,659
I want another 100 to the power.

1062
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:31,539
Any more tuning is dangerous, Shima-san.

1063
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,499
Please do it.

1064
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,189
Yes.

1065
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:39,470
Can I put it off a week?

1066
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:42,889
I'll arrange the flights.

1067
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:44,099
Yes.

1068
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:48,270
Of course. My last class is going to be tough.

1069
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,310
It's perfect.

1070
01:26:56,980 --> 01:27:01,279
So the Blackbird is a doctor? What a surprise!

1071
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,579
Is your GT-R fast?

1072
01:27:04,580 --> 01:27:06,039
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

1073
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,999
No.

1074
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,064
I really hate doctors and managers.

1075
01:27:11,065 --> 01:27:14,169
They always look down on you like parents.

1076
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:18,090
But, wouldn't you be in trouble without both existing?

1077
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:21,640
Yeah.

1078
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:40,709
Ready?!

1079
01:27:40,710 --> 01:27:43,290
Any time.

1080
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:47,679
I'm always left out of the most exciting part.

1081
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:49,669
Just race with us.

1082
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:52,430
I don't mind.

1083
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:56,930
No thanks. I can read in between the lines.

1084
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:11,780
Let me warn you, looks like it's going to be a rough ride.

1085
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:24,170
Andersan said this:

1086
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:28,259
"No matter how high the mountain, people can climb it."

1087
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:31,600
"...as long as they have the determination and confidence."

1088
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,059
I can't just play around!

1089
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,479
Vary soon I'm going to be a papa!

1090
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,060
At least I can get someone to call me that!

1091
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:02,370
Right mow she's going to race like she did when she was with your bro.

1092
01:30:36,850 --> 01:30:40,929
it's those racers. Kick their asses today!

1093
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:43,679
They'll pass you soon.

1094
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:44,879
Okay!

1095
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,190
Leave it to me. I'll scare them.

1096
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:02,530
Hurry!

1097
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,830
It's over!

1098
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:46,420
You can forget about your brother now, right?

1099
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,840
And the Z.

1100
01:33:06,660 --> 01:33:12,780
Near Oina, a car accident has broken out on fire.

1101
01:33:53,900 --> 01:34:01,140
That car truly drove like it was mad... trying to twist its own body.

1102
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,814
I'm going.

1103
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:16,110
Okay.

1104
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:33,329
Perhaps that car really was a devil.

1105
01:34:33,330 --> 01:34:37,309
But... you're the only one I wanted to know.

1106
01:34:37,310 --> 01:34:41,309
That day... my life was saved...

1107
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:44,149
...by that Z.

1108
01:34:44,150 --> 01:34:50,360
If the Z hadn't been there, I would surely have...

1109
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,309
His wounds were lighter that I thought.

1110
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:18,249
The truck driver admitted to causing the accident.

1111
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:21,909
He was not severely punished.

1112
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:25,160
Hurry and take your seat.

1113
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:26,614
Continue.

1114
01:35:26,615 --> 01:35:27,449
Okay.

1115
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:32,250
A person who does not know the road, is lost...

1116
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:37,839
Seems the girl with the GT-R is really popular in dramas.

1117
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,680
I... Actually...

1118
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:43,769
...am a man.

1119
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:45,634
Okay, cut!

1120
01:35:45,635 --> 01:35:48,270
Okay.

1121
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:54,530
But... seems you'll see her racing at Wangan in her free time.

1122
01:35:57,070 --> 01:36:02,369
It feels like you're by my side when I come to Wangan, event now.

1123
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:04,579
Eriko!

1124
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,509
Hi!

1125
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:09,000
See you tomorrow! Bye bye!

1126
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:14,349
P.S.

1127
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:16,429
That burnt up Z...

1128
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:19,559
...he took it.

1129
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:21,689
He plans to once more...

1130
01:36:21,690 --> 01:36:24,730
...drive that Z.

1
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:09,747
Stop!

2
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:35,481
It will soon be 12 hrs.
since the incident occurred.

3
00:02:36,154 --> 00:02:40,407
This morning, a security van
was attacked on a street in Kamata.

4
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:45,408
260 million yen in cash
was stolen by

5
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,790
a group of 3 perpetrators,

6
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:52,836
who broke through the emergency cordon.

7
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:56,423
The perpetrators seem to be armed.

8
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:58,800
With their escape route severed,

9
00:02:58,801 --> 00:03:02,012
the perpetrators drove
their vehicle into a shopping mall

10
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:07,013
and took some 50 shoppers
and store clerks who were there.

11
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:11,063
The perpetrator group
consists of 3 males.

12
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:16,064
One is between 60 to 70 years of age.

13
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:34,795
Yuji, did you know?

14
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:37,005
Big bro, don't talk.

15
00:03:37,006 --> 00:03:42,006
We were supposed to be fired yesterday.

16
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:47,724
They only want half the part-timers.

17
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:49,017
That sucks.

18
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:54,018
Hey. you there!

19
00:03:54,524 --> 00:03:56,149
Told you not to talk.

20
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,983
Sorry.

21
00:03:56,984 --> 00:04:00,153
Come.

22
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:05,154
I'll blow your brains out.

23
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,590
Kill the lights, dammit.

24
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:35,021
A perpetrator has appeared
with a gun on a hostage's head.

25
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:35,939
I repeat.

26
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,858
At 7:23 p.m.

27
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:41,862
one of the perpetrators...

28
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,823
Check their faces on the database.

29
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:49,824
Yes, sir.

30
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:03,508
It's long past 30 min.

31
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:08,509
Don't you care about the hostages?

32
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:34,076
I'm Reiko Usagi (Bunny). MPD
Special Investigation Squad.

33
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,754
You're hurt. Are you okay?

34
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:45,634
Never mind. What's the answer?

35
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:50,635
I don't talk to you.

36
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:11,701
I apologize the response is delayed.

37
00:06:11,702 --> 00:06:13,203
And?

38
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:14,621
We are trying.

39
00:06:14,622 --> 00:06:15,997
Qnly...

40
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:20,998
It's not easy to find a bus
with more than 50 seats.

41
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:29,135
We can get a micro-bus with 20 seats.

42
00:06:29,136 --> 00:06:30,637
Oh, really?

43
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:35,638
In return, release the 30 hostages
who cannot board the bus.

44
00:06:37,144 --> 00:06:39,896
What do you say to this condition?

45
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:44,192
Bunny's going for the frontal attack.

46
00:06:44,193 --> 00:06:47,571
Insp. Kizaki, the list of the hostages.

47
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:52,572
Chief.

48
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:56,454
Identities of the hostages confirmed.

49
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,875
Hostages' hands are bond by duct tape.

50
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,960
Not going to the scene?

51
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:05,213
Promotion test's coming up.

52
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:10,214
Heard a siege situation like this
comes out it in the test.

53
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,183
Don't you have to go out there?

54
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:21,187
I'm worried about his studies.

55
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,731
Coming along?

56
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:24,107
Yes.

57
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:29,108
Yumi, that hand. You're too friendly.

58
00:07:29,906 --> 00:07:31,865
Just for the record,

59
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:36,369
tell me your name.

60
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,662
Lay off him.

61
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:40,832
Your name.

62
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:43,960
It's...Yusuke Kimoto.

63
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:45,754
Mr. Yusuke Kimoto.

64
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:49,716
Yusuke Kimoto. He's a part-timer.

65
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:53,553
One with the gun is Kazuo Tanimura.

66
00:07:53,554 --> 00:07:55,847
<i>2 priors or robbery and assault.</i>

67
00:07:55,848 --> 00:07:59,351
Seems to go berserk when excited.

68
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:04,352
The uniform they hit,
breaking through the road block.

69
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:09,357
Died in the hospital.

70
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:22,123
Tanimura, come back in.

71
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:25,543
These bastards are playing with us.

72
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:29,005
I said come back in.

73
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:33,843
He's one of you, but can't control him?

74
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:36,513
Yes, that's right.

75
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:41,514
The situation can end shamefully

76
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:45,689
unless it is resolved quickly.

77
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,567
What about my terms?

78
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:54,568
Ah, yes. Please give us
some time to think about them.

79
00:08:55,241 --> 00:08:59,369
We will respond as soon as we can.

80
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,122
He's too calm. This is bad.

81
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:07,123
Could be bad news.

82
00:09:08,004 --> 00:09:13,004
There's no time.

83
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:16,761
You're really a nag, aren't you?

84
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:19,305
Okay?

85
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:24,306
Tanimura, I don't want you to forget

86
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:29,395
that what we are conspiring
is an orthodox hostage situation.

87
00:09:31,485 --> 00:09:36,485
At least so far.

88
00:10:00,473 --> 00:10:03,266
CI Chief.

89
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:08,267
But...that is...

90
00:10:10,316 --> 00:10:11,858
What's going on?

91
00:10:11,859 --> 00:10:16,859
Supt. Kirisawa. I'm Nakamaru, SAT.

92
00:10:21,452 --> 00:10:26,452
You seem to...lack calmness.

93
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:33,546
Shut up.

94
00:10:33,547 --> 00:10:35,548
What?

95
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:38,343
That gun...

96
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:42,806
I'll keep it.

97
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:47,807
I promised the hostages
won't be harmed.

98
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:53,646
L...never...never...lie!

99
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:58,738
Under this circumstance

100
00:10:58,739 --> 00:11:03,739
can you be certain
you can control yourself?

101
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,900
Chief, a gunshot in the mall.

102
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,444
I heard a gunshot.

103
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:40,864
A gun was fired inside.

104
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:45,865
Bunny, get away from there.

105
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:51,082
Bunny! Get back!

106
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:54,043
What? What happened?

107
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:57,130
What do you think?

108
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,424
Well?

109
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:02,969
Is the weight of life the same

110
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,970
for everyone?

111
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:14,898
Get back.

112
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:15,607
But...

113
00:12:15,608 --> 00:12:18,067
SAT is in command.

114
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,403
Forced assault...

115
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,113
M PD General's order.

116
00:12:22,114 --> 00:12:23,364
- We've just begun.

117
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:25,116
It's already 12 hrs.

118
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:28,036
It's not time wasted.

119
00:12:28,037 --> 00:12:33,037
Bunny.

120
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:40,252
Have you heard of Mark Chapman?

121
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,593
Shot John Lennon.

122
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:45,053
Did he really?

123
00:12:45,054 --> 00:12:47,388
On Dec. 8th exactly30 years ago,

124
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:50,892
in front of Dakota House in N.Y.,

125
00:12:50,893 --> 00:12:55,188
a 25-year old man named Mark Chapman

126
00:12:55,189 --> 00:13:00,189
shot ex-Beatles John Lennon
in the back 5 times.

127
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:05,823
He was arrested on the spot

128
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:09,410
and is still in prison.

129
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:12,163
What's he getting at?

130
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:16,459
What if he is released on bail?

131
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,922
He will likely be killed
by John Lennon's fans.

132
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:25,385
Justice Dept. thinks so
and won't release him.

133
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:27,095
Listen well.

134
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:31,432
Mark Chapman killed
an international celebrity

135
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:36,354
but his life is protected by the state.

136
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:38,022
Obviously,

137
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:43,023
isn't there a difference
in the weight of life?

138
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:57,375
Why did cut the line?

139
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,837
Why?

140
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:04,882
Not only the weight of life.

141
00:14:04,883 --> 00:14:08,303
What about our world now?

142
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:13,304
Are people guaranteed lifestyles,
befitting their hard work?

143
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:19,314
Honest people lose out and are battered.

144
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:22,233
Don't you want to

145
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:26,571
change such a world?

146
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:31,572
I am confident I can change the world.

147
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:34,120
I Will

148
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:39,121
show you that.

149
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:48,134
They'll go for

150
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:52,096
forced assault.

151
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:54,098
Everybody, bear witness.

152
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:59,099
The time has come.

153
00:15:01,398 --> 00:15:05,318
Cut the line?

154
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:10,319
No intention to negotiate further.

155
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:15,953
Usagn

156
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:20,954
No! Stop!

157
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:55,781
It's a trap!

158
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,199
Stop! Perpetrators are among them.

159
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Are you all right?

160
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:14,197
Freeze!

161
00:17:14,198 --> 00:17:18,743
Lose the gun.

162
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:23,744
Lose the gun.

163
00:17:35,552 --> 00:17:40,552
He's apprehended.

164
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:53,732
How do you

165
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:58,862
change the world?

166
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:05,581
How?

167
00:18:05,582 --> 00:18:09,085
Just watch

168
00:18:09,086 --> 00:18:14,086
what I do.

169
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,264
Watch you?

170
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:26,265
Tell me. How do you do it?

171
00:18:39,157 --> 00:18:43,578
More on Kamata Shopping Mall.

172
00:18:43,579 --> 00:18:48,416
Secured by the police, the hostages
were transported to a hospital

173
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:50,876
for treatment of injuries.

174
00:18:50,877 --> 00:18:54,797
I was blindfolded.
Didn't know what happened.

175
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:57,174
It's aired nationwide.

176
00:18:57,175 --> 00:19:02,175
Yusuke! Watch this!

177
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:09,057
How much savings do you have?

178
00:19:09,062 --> 00:19:13,399
No money, no work. Get a life.

179
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,027
Damn it.

180
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:20,781
The money the perpetrator left.
Should've taken it.

181
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:23,200
Big bro.

182
00:19:23,201 --> 00:19:28,201
C'mon. I'm just kidding.

183
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:35,876
So hot.

184
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:59,403
We also know
there was another accomplice.

185
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:04,404
After the explosion, he escaped,
hiding among the 50 odd hostages.

186
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:24,424
METROPLITAN POLICE DEPT.
2ND BLDG.

187
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:29,975
When the line was cut,
I realized it was a trap.

188
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:31,894
But it was too late.

189
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:35,690
And we overlooked the perpetrator
among the hostages.

190
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:38,943
Couldn't be helped

191
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,988
in that chaos.

192
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:47,989
He...still hasn't spoken a word.

193
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:51,831
This is the gun you had.

194
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:56,832
Can't trace his identity from
fingerprints and items on him.

195
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:01,837
Who the hell is he?

196
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:07,680
He could've escaped if he wanted to.

197
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:12,681
Besides all the money was there.

198
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:20,188
Oh, whatever.
It's not our case anymore.

199
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:31,032
Yes. I'll take the evening flight
on the 27th as scheduled.

200
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:34,457
At New Chitose Airport...

201
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:39,458
Yes, I will be there. Thank you.

202
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:46,218
Hokkaido? That's great.

203
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:51,219
Heard you took a vacation
at the same time as me.

204
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:57,726
There's nothing worse
than running into you.

205
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:01,484
Seeing seals at Asahiyama Zoo?

206
00:22:01,485 --> 00:22:04,111
No, I'm not.

207
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:07,990
Ah...attending my high school friend's
wedding reception.

208
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:12,991
Find a guy there and get married.
And don't come back.

209
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:17,917
Kizaki, where are you going?

210
00:22:17,918 --> 00:22:19,376
At least it's not

211
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:24,377
Hokkaido.

212
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:47,150
Everyday...l see the same dream.

213
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:52,368
Of what?

214
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:57,369
Of you dying.

215
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:03,583
<i>7 years...</i>

216
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:07,925
<i>For 7 years you come</i>

217
00:23:07,926 --> 00:23:12,926
to visit me every single week.

218
00:23:13,223 --> 00:23:18,223
Because you say you'll die, if I don't.

219
00:23:21,314 --> 00:23:26,314
Why do I see the same dream?

220
00:23:32,617 --> 00:23:37,246
I thought our meeting

221
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:42,247
would be terminated
only by my execution.

222
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:49,174
Never thought

223
00:23:49,175 --> 00:23:54,175
you'd die before me.

224
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:01,729
See the dream, too?

225
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,356
No.

226
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:09,357
Then, why that look just now?

227
00:24:11,698 --> 00:24:16,698
Why did you have that look?

228
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:21,290
You never cease

229
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:26,291
to surprise me.

230
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,300
What do you mean?

231
00:24:31,301 --> 00:24:36,301
What do you mean?!

232
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:42,015
Only I can understand that.

233
00:24:42,354 --> 00:24:47,354
Today, you came to bid
your eternal farewell.

234
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:50,569
That is what

235
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,570
only I can understand.

236
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:17,930
Please come again.

237
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:22,931
Thank you. Please come again.

238
00:25:29,401 --> 00:25:32,027
That passenger's name and flight No.

239
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:37,028
Flight 201 for Hokkaido.
Name: Kazuo Takada.

240
00:25:39,452 --> 00:25:41,870
Kimoto, Yusuke.

241
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:46,871
How do I do it?

242
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:20,071
It's a fine day today.

243
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:29,001
Ma'am.

244
00:26:29,002 --> 00:26:34,002
Police?

245
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,312
Ma'am.

246
00:26:48,313 --> 00:26:49,188
Later.

247
00:26:49,189 --> 00:26:54,189
We are taking off. Please sit down.

248
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:08,540
Hey, this plane's going to Kite-Kyushu.

249
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:13,541
You're going to Hokkaido. Aren't you?

250
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:27,184
MAIL SENT

251
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:32,185
RECEIVED MAIL

252
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:38,070
Chief Kirisawa.

253
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:39,571
What's up?

254
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:42,991
A photo from Usagi's mobile.

255
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:47,992
From Bunny?

256
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,376
Who is it?

257
00:27:52,377 --> 00:27:55,462
A pretty boy. And young. Some catch.

258
00:27:55,463 --> 00:28:00,463
Showing off her guy from a plane?

259
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:08,892
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Ready.

260
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:13,893
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Done.

261
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:20,567
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Got it.

262
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,046
From that hostage case?

263
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:42,301
He was a hostage.
His name is Yusuke Kimoto.

264
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:43,719
$0?

265
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,640
He drew my attention,
and somehow stayed that way.

266
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,809
Somehow, huh?

267
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,644
Oh, no, not again.

268
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:57,645
Your somehow
always leads to big trouble.

269
00:28:57,817 --> 00:28:59,568
Much obliged.

270
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:02,571
Ouch!

271
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,282
Who is that?

272
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:10,283
Just a colleague, who
somehow gets on the wrong plane.

273
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,463
It's still confidential.

274
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:24,464
My fiancée...Yuka Donoue.

275
00:29:24,844 --> 00:29:29,844
How do you do? I'm Usagi.

276
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:32,226
Wasn't told about her.

277
00:29:32,227 --> 00:29:34,311
Neither was I.

278
00:29:34,312 --> 00:29:39,312
I won't bother you.

279
00:29:45,531 --> 00:29:49,243
You should've reported it
before we took off.

280
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:54,244
I'm sorry.

281
00:29:56,876 --> 00:29:59,628
Hey, give me a break.

282
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:02,965
Should've told you
before take-of, but...

283
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,925
What shall we do?

284
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:06,802
Go back to Haneda.

285
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:11,803
Police officer or not, if not
on the passenger list, we can't fly.

286
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,350
Contact ACC.

287
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:15,394
Copy that.

288
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:20,395
Skybird two zero one request
turning back toward Haneda Airport

289
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,987
What's wrong with her?

290
00:30:24,988 --> 00:30:26,738
What's going on?

291
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:31,739
Usagi is a stowaway
on Skybird 201 for Kita-Kyushuu.

292
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:35,914
Captain's message
via Air Traffic Bureau.

293
00:30:35,915 --> 00:30:40,915
Against the law. Plane'll return
to Haneda to get her off board.

294
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:43,547
I knew it.

295
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:48,468
Kizaki is on that Skybird 201
bound for Kite-Kyushu.

296
00:30:48,469 --> 00:30:53,469
He left a memo.

297
00:30:53,474 --> 00:30:56,184
Something going on with him?

298
00:30:56,185 --> 00:30:58,353
Nothing really.

299
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:02,858
Well, about this man...

300
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:07,859
He looks like a hostage in...

301
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:04,669
Yusuke, can't quit now.

302
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,670
I know.

303
00:32:26,275 --> 00:32:28,527
What do you think?

304
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:31,363
I think it's unlikely, but...

305
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:36,364
Unlikely, huh?

306
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:47,875
I can do it...l can do it.

307
00:34:45,373 --> 00:34:48,833
It's your unlikely, Usagi.

308
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:53,255
I smelled oil...gun oil.

309
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:58,256
I'm not mistaken. I hate this smell.

310
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:06,806
I'm sorry. I go first.

311
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:36,002
Be quiet.

312
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,928
Some cold drinks.

313
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:46,929
Here you are.

314
00:35:52,273 --> 00:35:57,273
Don't do anything.

315
00:35:59,822 --> 00:36:04,701
Passengers, please listen.

316
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:09,702
This plane will now
be under our control.

317
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:21,172
Behave and you won't be harmed.

318
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:26,802
Don't go now.

319
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,189
Knew it.

320
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,523
Hijack.

321
00:36:35,524 --> 00:36:40,524
Don't you have a better excuse?

322
00:36:42,114 --> 00:36:45,116
Stay in your seats.

323
00:36:45,117 --> 00:36:48,953
Is he the only hijacker?

324
00:36:48,954 --> 00:36:51,915
He's just a kid. It won't be hard.

325
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,458
C'mon.

326
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:56,252
With my signal

327
00:36:56,253 --> 00:36:59,005
we both take him.

328
00:36:59,006 --> 00:37:01,091
All right?

329
00:37:01,092 --> 00:37:04,511
Another must've entered the cockpit.

330
00:37:04,512 --> 00:37:06,221
Then, he's alone here?

331
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:07,806
You never know.

332
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:10,225
If he's alone...

333
00:37:10,226 --> 00:37:15,226
Let's take him.

334
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:19,984
Later.

335
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:24,985
Now.

336
00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:33,869
Better not come up with funny ideas.

337
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:51,178
So, there was another one.

338
00:38:05,281 --> 00:38:08,825
Captain, how come
Mt. Fuji's on our left?

339
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:12,203
Flying in the opposite direction.

340
00:38:12,204 --> 00:38:14,956
We're going back to Haneda.

341
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:17,292
What? Why are we going back?

342
00:38:17,293 --> 00:38:21,337
What for?

343
00:38:21,338 --> 00:38:22,797
What is it?

344
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:26,301
Heading back to Haneda.

345
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:29,179
Why?

346
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,972
Something happened.

347
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:35,973
Suspected instrument malfunction,

348
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:42,354
but seems sound now.

349
00:38:43,444 --> 00:38:45,195
If so,

350
00:38:45,196 --> 00:38:50,196
fly the official course.

351
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,047
Move those passengers here.

352
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:09,048
Hurry!

353
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:21,022
What did you just push?

354
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:23,900
Hasegawa.

355
00:39:23,901 --> 00:39:28,901
Come back.

356
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:35,199
Hijack signal!

357
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:41,580
Issue emergency.

358
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,588
Fasten seatbelts securely.

359
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:48,424
Please don't stand up.

360
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:50,677
What happened?

361
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:53,638
Fasten seatbelts...

362
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,639
It's a hijack.

363
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:16,786
Are you all right? We'll get help.

364
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:19,163
Passengerfist

365
00:40:19,164 --> 00:40:24,164
The passenger list. Hurry up

366
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:39,976
The name?

367
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:44,977
Hurry UP-

368
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,859
My wife is ill.

369
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,195
I'm sorry.

370
00:40:51,196 --> 00:40:54,949
I am truly sorry.

371
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:59,950
What's the ransom demand?
Must be about 500 million?

372
00:41:05,586 --> 00:41:08,546
I'm Kirisawa, MPD,
Special Investigation Squad.

373
00:41:08,547 --> 00:41:10,590
I'm Supt. Sakuma.

374
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:15,591
- Anything from the hijackers?
Not yet.

375
00:41:17,389 --> 00:41:22,389
Please transfer the line here?
Need to record the voices.

376
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,313
Can you do it?

377
00:41:25,314 --> 00:41:28,942
I will, but there are other planes.

378
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:33,943
We won't interfere.
Okay, guys, let's do our work.

379
00:41:35,658 --> 00:41:40,658
This is flight 201.

380
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:51,669
Are the police there?

381
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,428
I'm Kirisawa, MPD SIS.

382
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:59,222
Hello.

383
00:41:59,223 --> 00:42:03,309
There are some things to confirm.

384
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:07,397
Any injured?

385
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:11,317
Yes, there is.

386
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:14,404
Co-pilot Hasegawa was shot.

387
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:16,239
Hey, don't bud in.

388
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,950
How bad is it?

389
00:42:18,951 --> 00:42:23,371
Not treated for long,
he could bleed to death.

390
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:24,956
POSSESSES GUN

391
00:42:24,957 --> 00:42:28,084
ls there a doctor or a nurse on board?

392
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:30,545
Is there?

393
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:35,546
Things don't always
work out so conveniently.

394
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:42,557
Trying to play a nurse?

395
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:44,684
If I can get near them...

396
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:49,685
Don't be rash.

397
00:42:51,692 --> 00:42:56,487
DEAR MOM AND DAD,
THANKS FOR BRING ME UP...

398
00:42:56,488 --> 00:43:01,488
Regular mobiles
won't work in this altitude.

399
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:08,082
How can I contact land?

400
00:43:08,083 --> 00:43:13,004
With a satellite mobile.
Regular passengers won't have one.

401
00:43:13,005 --> 00:43:15,673
Maybe the crew. For emergency?

402
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:18,509
If so, the pilot.

403
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:20,511
The pilot...

404
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:25,512
But the cockpit is
under control of the hijackers.

405
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:39,405
Your name. Tell me your name.

406
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:42,450
What's it to you?

407
00:43:42,451 --> 00:43:46,496
Is he Yusuke Kimoto?

408
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:51,497
The voice-mark doesn't match.
He's a 35 to 40 year-old male.

409
00:43:52,127 --> 00:43:53,836
Have it your way.

410
00:43:53,837 --> 00:43:58,837
From now on, I'll call you Mr. Asshole.

411
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,181
Very funny.

412
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:07,767
Well, Mr. Asshole, first...

413
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:11,562
I'm Mark Chapman.

414
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:13,272
Is he joking?

415
00:44:13,273 --> 00:44:16,067
Playing his game, huh?

416
00:44:16,068 --> 00:44:20,279
Either way, he's an asshole.

417
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,280
Well, then, as you like, Mr. Chapman.

418
00:44:25,452 --> 00:44:30,164
Let us confirm
as our mutual understanding.

419
00:44:30,165 --> 00:44:32,583
You and I are responsible

420
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:37,584
for the lives of
159 passengers and crew.

421
00:44:38,257 --> 00:44:43,257
Let us continue our talk
with that in mind.

422
00:44:45,055 --> 00:44:50,055
The weight of life...

423
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:55,185
How heavy is it?

424
00:44:57,568 --> 00:45:00,319
NAME

425
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,031
Who is he searching for?

426
00:45:04,032 --> 00:45:07,034
This is bad.

427
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:12,035
My name is not on the passenger list.

428
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:30,345
IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE MOBILE,
CONTACT NEAREST CA.

429
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,733
Your name.

430
00:45:38,734 --> 00:45:43,734
Seiichiro Kizaki.

431
00:45:45,574 --> 00:45:47,825
Not on the list.

432
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:49,911
There is no Kizaki.

433
00:45:49,912 --> 00:45:53,039
Impossible...Look carefully.

434
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,457
My fault.

435
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:59,458
When reserving tickets,
I registered you as Donoue.

436
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:05,422
I haven't decided
to marry into your family.

437
00:46:37,042 --> 00:46:42,042
Well, then, Mr. Chapman,
what is your purpose?

438
00:46:42,297 --> 00:46:47,297
Why are you and
your associates doing this?

439
00:46:47,886 --> 00:46:51,180
We have one demand.

440
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:54,141
HIJACKER ? PLURAL

441
00:46:54,142 --> 00:46:57,061
Mr. Keiichi Mido is detained
at Kamata East Police St.

442
00:46:57,062 --> 00:47:02,062
We demand his immediate release.

443
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:09,569
Keiichiro Mido?

444
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:13,369
We want Master Mido

445
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,621
returned to us.

446
00:47:15,622 --> 00:47:20,622
Master?

447
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:28,050
We will give you 1 hour to respond.

448
00:47:28,051 --> 00:47:30,011
After that,

449
00:47:30,012 --> 00:47:35,012
we'll kill a passenger every minute.

450
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:40,851
They can't do that.

451
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:55,953
Was he there?

452
00:47:55,954 --> 00:48:00,954
Yes, 57-K.

453
00:48:03,295 --> 00:48:07,631
Ex-Diet member sec. Yoshinao Kawano.

454
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:12,178
What do we do next?

455
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:16,015
Big bro., calm down.

456
00:48:16,016 --> 00:48:18,267
Take all he has on him.

457
00:48:18,268 --> 00:48:20,686
- Yes, I will.
Shall I do it?

458
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:25,687
I can do it.

459
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:29,779
At present, the hijackers demand

460
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:34,492
immediate release of Keiichiro Mido.

461
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:37,370
No demand for ransom.

462
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:42,371
Who is this Mido character?

463
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:46,670
CREATE THE FUTURE LEAGUE

464
00:48:46,671 --> 00:48:48,130
Political society?

465
00:48:48,131 --> 00:48:53,131
Under investigation now.

466
00:48:54,137 --> 00:48:56,263
You're Kirisawa, right?

467
00:48:56,264 --> 00:48:57,723
Yes, sir.

468
00:48:57,724 --> 00:49:02,561
Is the safety of
the crew and passengers confirmed?

469
00:49:02,562 --> 00:49:05,564
Not all is accounted for,

470
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:10,565
but the co-pilot was shot
and seriously injured.

471
00:49:11,238 --> 00:49:14,448
And in the additional report

472
00:49:14,449 --> 00:49:18,577
by coincidence,
SIS members Capt. Kizaki and

473
00:49:18,578 --> 00:49:22,998
Sgt. Usagi are on that plane.

474
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:26,877
So, are they coping
with the situation aboard?

475
00:49:26,878 --> 00:49:31,298
At present, we are
unable to contact them.

476
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:33,300
We are in the dark.

477
00:49:33,301 --> 00:49:36,178
It's a dangerous situation.

478
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:39,723
Could they take action on their own?

479
00:49:39,724 --> 00:49:44,724
They have been trained
to act calmly and rationally.

480
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:49,855
I assure you they would
never act recklessly.

481
00:50:09,129 --> 00:50:13,924
Excuse me.

482
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:17,344
The cabin has calmed down.

483
00:50:17,345 --> 00:50:19,638
Let me see.

484
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:24,639
Don't worry. You'll make it.

485
00:50:26,563 --> 00:50:31,563
Can't treat him here.
May we move him to the cabin?

486
00:50:31,943 --> 00:50:35,196
Please.

487
00:50:35,197 --> 00:50:40,197
Thank you very much.

488
00:50:43,205 --> 00:50:45,039
Oh, and Capt. Kano.

489
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,543
Ventilation of ducts
connecting top and bottom is bad.

490
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:50,753
Top and bottom?

491
00:50:50,754 --> 00:50:52,755
Yes.

492
00:50:52,756 --> 00:50:55,341
Connecting top and bottom.

493
00:50:55,342 --> 00:51:00,342
If possible, open some other duct.

494
00:51:03,975 --> 00:51:07,102
Hey, wait.

495
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:10,105
Besides that...

496
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:14,151
Negotiate with the police all you want,

497
00:51:14,152 --> 00:51:19,152
but think about this plane, too.

498
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:24,449
This plane has fuel
for less than an hour.

499
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:30,084
It's bound for Kite-Kyushu.

500
00:51:30,085 --> 00:51:33,337
It should fly for 5 more hrs.

501
00:51:33,338 --> 00:51:38,338
You know we almost had to
go back to Haneda.

502
00:51:39,553 --> 00:51:41,512
So what?

503
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:46,513
Passenger planes fly
on a delicate balance of weight.

504
00:51:46,685 --> 00:51:49,645
Weight of 159 passengers and crew,

505
00:51:49,646 --> 00:51:51,522
weight of cargo.

506
00:51:51,523 --> 00:51:54,400
And weight of fuel.

507
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:59,401
The plane was too heavy
to go back soon after take-off.

508
00:52:01,741 --> 00:52:04,994
You dumped most of
the fuel at that time?

509
00:52:04,995 --> 00:52:07,580
Anyway, this plane

510
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:12,581
has less than an hour left.

511
00:52:30,186 --> 00:52:33,230
Hey. Hey.

512
00:52:33,231 --> 00:52:34,857
What?

513
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:39,858
This was passed around.

514
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:46,076
If you have satellite mobile,
contact nearest CA.

515
00:52:46,077 --> 00:52:51,077
Who passed this?

516
00:52:54,085 --> 00:52:59,085
Damn it! Who is it?

517
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:08,015
Excuse me.

518
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:13,016
I've been trying to
hold it, but I need to go.

519
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:17,232
Please let me.

520
00:53:17,233 --> 00:53:19,068
Sure. You may.

521
00:53:19,069 --> 00:53:20,611
Me, too.

522
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:22,237
In your dreams.

523
00:53:22,238 --> 00:53:23,572
Big bro.

524
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:27,660
Okay. One at a time.

525
00:53:27,661 --> 00:53:28,952
Ah, can you...

526
00:53:28,953 --> 00:53:30,120
Yes?

527
00:53:30,121 --> 00:53:33,832
You see my flight bag there?

528
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:38,833
Can you take out the operation manual?

529
00:53:39,255 --> 00:53:41,715
It's in the inner pocket.

530
00:53:41,716 --> 00:53:46,716
I see.

531
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:56,230
Find it?

532
00:53:56,231 --> 00:53:58,148
It's an A-4 size sheet.

533
00:53:58,149 --> 00:54:03,149
Manual on ducts
connecting top and bottom.

534
00:54:06,282 --> 00:54:08,909
Thank you.

535
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:10,411
BON DANCE FESTIVAL

536
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:13,497
Yes, this is it.

537
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:15,999
Hard work, but it's worthwhile.
Keep it up.

538
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Thank you very much.

539
00:54:17,001 --> 00:54:22,001
Thank you very much.

540
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:31,261
You saved my skin.

541
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:37,100
I felt he's a type to go berserk,
if he loses his head.

542
00:54:37,689 --> 00:54:40,357
What do you think?

543
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:45,358
If we separate them,
we can each take on one.

544
00:54:46,448 --> 00:54:49,408
Hurry up and go.

545
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:51,660
Hang on a bit more.

546
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:56,661
Trying to be a hero
at such a time can be fatal.

547
00:54:58,042 --> 00:54:59,209
Hello.

548
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,753
This is Usagi.

549
00:55:00,754 --> 00:55:03,839
Bunny?

550
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,215
Where are you?

551
00:55:05,216 --> 00:55:09,636
In the toilet. I'm using
the captain's satellite mobile.

552
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:11,764
The facts.

553
00:55:11,765 --> 00:55:14,767
3 perpetrators.
The main in the cockpit:

554
00:55:14,768 --> 00:55:17,227
<i>Other 2 are in the cabin.</i>

555
00:55:17,228 --> 00:55:19,188
<i>2 in the cabin...</i>

556
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:21,064
Can't they take them?

557
00:55:21,065 --> 00:55:22,900
Prime Minister.

558
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:25,110
Any demands from them?

559
00:55:25,111 --> 00:55:30,111
Yes, the release
of that shopping mall perpetrator.

560
00:55:34,162 --> 00:55:39,162
The police announced
the hijackers' demand.

561
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,881
<i>Kiichiro Mido, principal perpetrator of
the shopping mall incident 7 days ago</i>

562
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:50,882
is detained at Kamata Police St.

563
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:00,813
The hijackers are demanding
his immediate release.

564
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:03,273
<i>Are 2 incidents related?
Police are examining this.</i>

565
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:04,650
Mido?

566
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:08,737
Keiichiro?

567
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:11,365
There's no time.

568
00:56:11,366 --> 00:56:16,119
Perpetrators say they will
kill the passengers after 30 min.

569
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,664
They're only bluffing.

570
00:56:18,665 --> 00:56:21,291
With all due respect,

571
00:56:21,292 --> 00:56:24,711
such optimism can be dangerous.

572
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:29,712
And the plane's fuel
won't last one hour.

573
00:56:30,218 --> 00:56:34,888
The perpetrators are
beginning to be desperate.

574
00:56:34,889 --> 00:56:39,017
You think
we should give in to hijackers?

575
00:56:39,018 --> 00:56:42,938
Release Mido whatever his name?

576
00:56:42,939 --> 00:56:47,939
The fact is: 159 lives are
in the hands of the hijackers.

577
00:56:47,944 --> 00:56:51,655
We are not yielding to such morons.

578
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:56,656
Our country does not
yield to terrorists.

579
00:56:58,538 --> 00:57:03,538
Each of those 159 hostages
has a family.

580
00:57:04,502 --> 00:57:09,502
Friends and a lover, too.

581
00:57:10,675 --> 00:57:15,675
Only 30 more minutes.

582
00:57:30,236 --> 00:57:32,779
Some case we have.

583
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,616
Katayama, what brings you here?

584
00:57:35,617 --> 00:57:38,619
Went to Haneda guarding
Foreign Minister, but got stopped.

585
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:42,205
His trip's cancelled.

586
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:45,167
Came to watch to kill time?

587
00:57:45,168 --> 00:57:49,379
Of course not. Foreign Minister's
worried about this case.

588
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:54,380
Knowing we're friends, he wants me
to persuade you unofficially.

589
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:58,513
Persuade?

590
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:01,099
Defense Ministry has been told.

591
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:06,100
The hijacked plane is maneuvered
to US military monitored zone,

592
00:58:06,105 --> 00:58:11,105
it'll give US an excuse
to scramble their Phantoms.

593
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:13,654
Shoot down a private plane?

594
00:58:13,655 --> 00:58:16,615
It's just an option.

595
00:58:16,616 --> 00:58:19,493
Hey, we're conversing unofficially.

596
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:23,288
So, their true colors.

597
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:28,251
They want to show that
our gov't won't yield to terrorists.

598
00:58:28,252 --> 00:58:31,922
I'll have Flight 201land safely.

599
00:58:31,923 --> 00:58:35,676
I don't care if our gov't loses face.

600
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:39,972
Tell Foreign Minister I said so.

601
00:58:39,973 --> 00:58:44,973
So sure of yourself. How come?

602
00:58:45,228 --> 00:58:50,228
Cause Bunny and Kizaki are on board.

603
00:58:51,192 --> 00:58:53,026
Kirisawa.

604
00:58:53,027 --> 00:58:58,027
Why didn't you say so?

605
00:58:58,741 --> 00:58:59,950
Oh, hi.

606
00:58:59,951 --> 00:59:02,619
You're doing well.

607
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:06,581
Supt. Kirisawa.

608
00:59:06,582 --> 00:59:08,125
Any information?

609
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:11,628
A tenant in Mido's ex-flat said

610
00:59:11,629 --> 00:59:16,629
that when he moved in 5 years ago,
he told people he was a journalist.

611
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,052
A journalist?

612
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:24,053
Those, who stayed with him
to the end, adored him as a guru.

613
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:35,027
This is it.

614
00:59:35,028 --> 00:59:39,781
POWER OF THE PRESS

615
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:44,782
INTERVIEW:
SOICHIRO AMAMIYA, JOURNALIST

616
00:59:55,131 --> 01:00:00,131
It's so sad, isn't it?

617
01:00:03,848 --> 01:00:08,848
Who'd have believed
he would be released

618
01:00:11,397 --> 01:00:16,397
by such drastic means.

619
01:00:33,211 --> 01:00:35,420
JOKER

620
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:40,421
Well prepared.
So, you have a satellite mobile.

621
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:47,849
I see...

622
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:52,850
So, that's it.

623
01:00:57,568 --> 01:01:00,987
Don't tell me...

624
01:01:00,988 --> 01:01:05,988
You want me
to persuade the young men

625
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:12,370
taking their stand up above.

626
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:17,212
Is that too much to ask?

627
01:01:17,213 --> 01:01:22,213
You're a fool.

628
01:01:24,929 --> 01:01:29,929
Is it funny?

629
01:01:35,273 --> 01:01:40,273
<i>Among the hijackers,
2 are real brothers.</i>

630
01:01:40,862 --> 01:01:45,862
Until now, they barely survived,
working part-time.

631
01:01:46,826 --> 01:01:51,288
The brothers are
just ordinary young men.

632
01:01:51,289 --> 01:01:55,542
What did you

633
01:01:55,543 --> 01:01:57,586
do to them?

634
01:01:57,587 --> 01:02:02,587
What did you say?

635
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:15,520
You're only using them.

636
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:18,982
They are seeking...such a thing.

637
01:02:18,983 --> 01:02:23,983
Young people are like that.

638
01:02:25,865 --> 01:02:30,865
They finally found
what they can stake their life for.

639
01:02:35,041 --> 01:02:40,041
Now is their time of splendor.

640
01:02:42,173 --> 01:02:47,173
Aren't they beautiful young men?

641
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:52,386
If I tell them to stop,

642
01:02:53,768 --> 01:02:57,187
they will.

643
01:02:57,188 --> 01:03:02,188
If I tell them to kill, they will.

644
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,320
If I tell them to die,

645
01:03:05,321 --> 01:03:10,321
they will.

646
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:16,706
Can't you see?

647
01:03:16,707 --> 01:03:21,707
I am protected...like Mark Chapman.

648
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:34,516
Any response from below?

649
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:36,851
Not yet.

650
01:03:36,852 --> 01:03:40,981
If the hour passes, we start killing, right?

651
01:03:40,982 --> 01:03:45,982
I've decided which one to kill first.

652
01:03:50,658 --> 01:03:55,620
So rich at that young age.
Can't stand him.

653
01:03:55,621 --> 01:03:56,913
Big bro.

654
01:03:56,914 --> 01:03:59,624
What's wrong? I'm one to do it.

655
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:04,625
We don't kill any hostage.
Mr. Mido said so, too.

656
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:06,715
This certainly isn't my day.

657
01:04:06,716 --> 01:04:09,551
Shu.

658
01:04:09,552 --> 01:04:13,221
Oh, Well, if I die, that's that.

659
01:04:13,222 --> 01:04:18,222
What're you saying?

660
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:22,105
Sir, it's no smoking.

661
01:04:22,106 --> 01:04:25,525
Oh, give me a break.

662
01:04:25,526 --> 01:04:30,526
And don't sir me.
I haven't been treated with respect.

663
01:04:34,493 --> 01:04:38,204
There's no time.
The fuel runs out in 30 min.

664
01:04:38,205 --> 01:04:40,957
The gov't just won't respond.

665
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,960
Can't afford to wait.

666
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:48,631
I agree.

667
01:04:48,632 --> 01:04:53,632
I'll continue my negotiation
with the asshole.

668
01:04:53,804 --> 01:04:56,806
While I keep him in the cockpit,

669
01:04:56,807 --> 01:05:01,807
<i>can you and Kizaki
take on the 2 in the cabin?</i>

670
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:07,108
Yes.

671
01:05:07,109 --> 01:05:12,109
As I start talking to the cockpit,
I'll ring your mobile once.

672
01:05:12,365 --> 01:05:15,825
That's the cue.

673
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:20,826
Copy that.

674
01:05:30,758 --> 01:05:34,344
This was passed around the passengers?

675
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:39,345
Yes.

676
01:05:40,726 --> 01:05:42,060
Captain.

677
01:05:42,061 --> 01:05:47,061
Yes?

678
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,400
If I'm not mistaken,
pilots of this airline

679
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:57,530
are required to carry satellite mobiles.

680
01:06:01,705 --> 01:06:03,498
It's a call from the control center.

681
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:08,499
Ignore it.

682
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:28,144
That bitch.

683
01:06:29,984 --> 01:06:34,984
<i>THERE ARE 2 RATS
AMONG THE PASSENGERS.</i>

684
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:40,660
You stay here.

685
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:45,661
That was good teamwork.

686
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:59,800
Why won't he answer? Asshole Chapman.

687
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:08,350
Chief, what's taking you?

688
01:07:18,908 --> 01:07:23,908
Open up. Open UP-

689
01:08:05,996 --> 01:08:10,996
Come out! I know you're in there!

690
01:08:15,256 --> 01:08:20,256
Come out!

691
01:08:21,136 --> 01:08:24,013
Kimoto.

692
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:29,014
You've been on my mind,
since the shopping mall incident.

693
01:08:30,145 --> 01:08:35,145
So when I saw you at Haneda Airport

694
01:08:35,985 --> 01:08:40,985
I felt something bad
was going to happen.

695
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:46,740
That's why I followed you to this plane.

696
01:08:47,621 --> 01:08:52,621
You're lying.
No, I'm not.

697
01:08:53,002 --> 01:08:56,421
Being part of this, what's your future?

698
01:08:56,422 --> 01:09:01,422
Shut up!

699
01:09:06,223 --> 01:09:09,017
I want to talk.

700
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:13,021
I want to talk with you.

701
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:18,022
The decision you are about to make,

702
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:25,070
will change your future completely.

703
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:26,618
My future?

704
01:09:26,619 --> 01:09:31,619
Are you able to kill people?

705
01:09:36,962 --> 01:09:40,006
Are you?

706
01:09:40,007 --> 01:09:43,176
Trust me.

707
01:09:43,177 --> 01:09:48,177
I will protect you.

708
01:10:02,071 --> 01:10:04,697
Must end this quickly.

709
01:10:04,698 --> 01:10:07,325
To the rats hiding

710
01:10:07,326 --> 01:10:10,745
somewhere in this plane.

711
01:10:10,746 --> 01:10:15,746
I will slowly count to 5.

712
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:20,672
I recommend you come out
during the count.

713
01:10:20,673 --> 01:10:23,633
If not...

714
01:10:23,634 --> 01:10:28,634
some passengers will lie dead here.

715
01:10:29,431 --> 01:10:33,976
1...

716
01:10:33,977 --> 01:10:37,647
2...

717
01:10:37,648 --> 01:10:41,150
3...

718
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:46,151
C'mon, rats! Hurry up and come out! Rats!

719
01:10:54,248 --> 01:10:59,248
You hear?

720
01:11:07,845 --> 01:11:10,638
As I thought.

721
01:11:10,639 --> 01:11:14,142
So you're a rat.

722
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:16,185
Not a rat, a bunny.

723
01:11:16,186 --> 01:11:21,186
They're different.

724
01:11:21,942 --> 01:11:26,942
How did you know about me?

725
01:11:27,656 --> 01:11:32,656
A deck of cards has a Joker.

726
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:35,079
Now,

727
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:40,080
let's have the other rat come out.

728
01:11:40,586 --> 01:11:44,464
Do you have time for this?

729
01:11:44,465 --> 01:11:49,465
This plane will run out of fuel
in less than 30 min.

730
01:11:55,142 --> 01:11:57,435
Negotiating takes time.

731
01:11:57,436 --> 01:12:01,814
To continue negotiations

732
01:12:01,815 --> 01:12:03,900
you need to fuel up.

733
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:07,779
But the assault team
could take advantage.

734
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,030
Yes, they could.

735
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:14,031
Passenger safety is my priority.
Let me handle it.

736
01:12:14,453 --> 01:12:19,453
I will stop the assault team.

737
01:12:22,252 --> 01:12:26,380
What I hate the most

738
01:12:26,381 --> 01:12:31,381
are people, who subdue
everything with strength.

739
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:40,394
Those on the side of the state

740
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:44,524
willingly lie for their objective.

741
01:12:44,525 --> 01:12:48,152
The police is the foremost example.

742
01:12:48,153 --> 01:12:50,905
I don't lie.

743
01:12:50,906 --> 01:12:55,906
If this plane crashes,
you won't achieve anything.

744
01:13:06,296 --> 01:13:11,296
No more negotiations.

745
01:13:28,318 --> 01:13:30,695
Bunny, what's going on?

746
01:13:30,696 --> 01:13:35,074
Improvising can fail.

747
01:13:35,075 --> 01:13:37,869
Unfortunately,

748
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:42,832
a passenger's dead.

749
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:47,833
You people are responsible.

750
01:13:51,675 --> 01:13:56,675
Chief Kirisawa, Usagi's sister
and friend are...

751
01:13:56,889 --> 01:14:01,058
I'm Rumiko Mimura. Where is my sister?

752
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:05,229
She's on leave, but I can't contact her.

753
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:10,230
I can't tell you the details,
but she's on an emergency duty.

754
01:14:12,279 --> 01:14:15,239
Didn't my sister tell you?

755
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:19,827
I introduced
a Sapporo hospital to Reiko.

756
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:20,953
Hospital?

757
01:14:20,954 --> 01:14:25,954
The hospital called, because
Reiko didn't go. They're worried.

758
01:14:27,377 --> 01:14:28,669
About what?

759
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:33,670
There's a blood clot in her heart.
Must be operated quickly.

760
01:14:35,344 --> 01:14:40,344
I should've gone with her.

761
01:14:40,766 --> 01:14:44,852
Reiko has a bomb in her heart.

762
01:14:44,853 --> 01:14:49,148
Stress on her heart can be fatal.

763
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:54,149
I want my sister back!

764
01:14:55,822 --> 01:15:00,701
Shall I kill you?

765
01:15:00,702 --> 01:15:05,702
Then, in return, promise
to land this plane safely.

766
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,043
Trying to be cool?

767
01:15:09,044 --> 01:15:13,422
The only bargaining point
is the release of Mr. Mido.

768
01:15:13,423 --> 01:15:18,423
Nothing else.

769
01:15:30,816 --> 01:15:35,816
Inspector General.

770
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:39,323
A gun was fired in the plane.

771
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:41,742
One passenger possibly dead.

772
01:15:41,743 --> 01:15:45,997
But there's still time.

773
01:15:45,998 --> 01:15:50,998
I guess we must reach a decision.

774
01:15:53,213 --> 01:15:56,424
M. Kurihara, what do you propose?

775
01:15:56,425 --> 01:16:01,387
Release Mido?

776
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:06,142
What will the int'l community say?

777
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:07,852
Who cares about that.

778
01:16:07,853 --> 01:16:11,689
Like publicizing terrorism
works in Japan.

779
01:16:11,690 --> 01:16:14,775
Yes, he's right.

780
01:16:14,776 --> 01:16:17,445
Then, tell me.

781
01:16:17,446 --> 01:16:22,446
Is Japan supposed to save face,

782
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:27,743
sacrificing 159 lives?

783
01:16:40,886 --> 01:16:45,886
Reach a decision?

784
01:16:48,852 --> 01:16:53,852
We'll release Keiichiro Mido.

785
01:16:55,233 --> 01:17:00,233
Then, do it immediately.

786
01:17:00,614 --> 01:17:03,115
We're processing it.

787
01:17:03,116 --> 01:17:07,328
Put that on live TV broadcast.

788
01:17:07,329 --> 01:17:11,957
What?

789
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:15,711
Lower the altitude to 1,700 ft.

790
01:17:15,712 --> 01:17:18,339
1,700?

791
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:23,340
Yes, 1,700!

792
01:17:24,012 --> 01:17:29,012
At that altitude
we can receive the TV waves.

793
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:35,310
Go that low?

794
01:18:15,605 --> 01:18:20,605
Minister, a word, please.

795
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:25,610
Whatever they may say here or abroad,

796
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:30,699
human life is of utmost priority.

797
01:18:30,745 --> 01:18:33,247
Human life is

798
01:18:33,248 --> 01:18:38,248
heavier than Earth. That's my belief.

799
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:54,431
The broadcast's starting.

800
01:19:13,288 --> 01:19:18,288
A historical moment.

801
01:19:20,837 --> 01:19:25,837
Our Master Mido

802
01:19:29,596 --> 01:19:33,682
will be free.

803
01:19:33,683 --> 01:19:38,683
If Mr. Mido is released, we can land.

804
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:40,356
Nakagawa.

805
01:19:40,357 --> 01:19:42,274
Change the world? I don't care.

806
01:19:42,275 --> 01:19:44,860
Don't forget what you promised.

807
01:19:44,861 --> 01:19:46,195
What d'you mean?

808
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:47,696
Shut up!

809
01:19:47,697 --> 01:19:52,326
I don't care about Mido
or whatever. I only trust him.

810
01:19:52,327 --> 01:19:57,327
You're smart. If we have money,
go to college and get a good job.

811
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:00,709
Bro...you're mistaken.

812
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:05,710
I don't care about those things now.

813
01:20:08,718 --> 01:20:13,718
Japan will be
the laughing stock in the world.

814
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:19,979
Is that your wish? Mr. Mido...

815
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,980
or rather journalist Yuichiro Asamiya,
ex-reporter or Howa journal.

816
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:28,696
What?

817
01:20:28,697 --> 01:20:33,697
30 yrs. ago, you reported
the civil war in Colombia.

818
01:20:34,703 --> 01:20:37,204
I'm just a reporter, who idolized you.

819
01:20:37,205 --> 01:20:40,958
That was long, long ago.

820
01:20:40,959 --> 01:20:45,959
That's right. Long, long ago.

821
01:20:46,589 --> 01:20:49,341
What are you now?

822
01:20:49,342 --> 01:20:53,387
Blackmail politicians or their weaknesses.

823
01:20:53,388 --> 01:20:57,516
You're only a hoodlum.

824
01:20:57,517 --> 01:21:01,478
A world uninfluenced by money.

825
01:21:01,479 --> 01:21:03,939
What is that? Tell me.

826
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:08,940
Wasn't finding that answer your job?

827
01:21:11,406 --> 01:21:14,533
Did you give UP?

828
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:19,534
In the near future, I'm going to
turn this country upside-down.

829
01:21:31,801 --> 01:21:36,096
For 30 years, a bigwig politician

830
01:21:36,097 --> 01:21:40,267
continued giving taxpayers' money

831
01:21:40,268 --> 01:21:45,268
illegally to companies loyal to him.

832
01:21:45,565 --> 01:21:50,069
The one who laundered all this money

833
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:53,947
was Keiichiro Mido.

834
01:21:53,948 --> 01:21:58,948
Well, such a rumor did come up.

835
01:21:59,788 --> 01:22:03,248
Were you pursuing that?

836
01:22:03,249 --> 01:22:06,210
You should write it.

837
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:10,005
Are you kidding?

838
01:22:10,006 --> 01:22:15,006
I value my life.

839
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:20,220
Then, tell me.
What is Mido planning to do?

840
01:22:21,851 --> 01:22:25,020
Mido is about to be transported.

841
01:22:25,021 --> 01:22:27,981
For a glimpse o his face,

842
01:22:27,982 --> 01:22:32,982
a multitude has begun to
gather around the transport route.

843
01:22:34,823 --> 01:22:38,742
Here he is. Mido has appeared.

844
01:22:38,743 --> 01:22:41,745
Mido has left the police station.

845
01:22:41,746 --> 01:22:44,248
Mido is wearing a white suit.

846
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:48,377
Escorted by several POs,
he looks solemn.

847
01:22:48,378 --> 01:22:51,505
They are walking towards a car.

848
01:22:51,506 --> 01:22:55,884
When released,
will Mido join the hijackers?

849
01:22:55,885 --> 01:23:00,885
But where the hijacked plane
will land is unknown.

850
01:23:14,612 --> 01:23:19,612
Emergency dispatch!
Station men around Kamata Police St.

851
01:23:24,914 --> 01:23:29,914
- What happened?
He's shot.

852
01:23:32,046 --> 01:23:35,340
Mr. Mido...

853
01:23:35,341 --> 01:23:37,551
Why...?

854
01:23:37,552 --> 01:23:42,552
Why...?

855
01:24:10,585 --> 01:24:15,585
Why?

856
01:24:18,301 --> 01:24:21,512
Unrelated to you people,

857
01:24:21,513 --> 01:24:26,513
something is moving.

858
01:24:26,643 --> 01:24:31,643
I don't know how important
that man is to you,

859
01:24:32,106 --> 01:24:37,106
but is he worth doing all this?

860
01:24:39,489 --> 01:24:44,489
He said he can change the world.

861
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:48,997
He said he can.

862
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:51,542
Those who study and
work hard will be rewarded.

863
01:24:51,543 --> 01:24:56,543
Said he will make such a world.

864
01:25:00,468 --> 01:25:03,595
Is that your excuse for this?

865
01:25:03,596 --> 01:25:07,766
Don't you think this world is wrong?

866
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:11,603
There's no time for that.

867
01:25:11,604 --> 01:25:13,939
What is important now

868
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:16,858
is the life of all who's here.

869
01:25:16,859 --> 01:25:21,859
Of course, yours, too.

870
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:24,157
The money.

871
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:29,158
What about the money?

872
01:25:30,832 --> 01:25:35,832
It was a mistake to bring you in.

873
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:41,671
Compared to your brother,
you lack calmness.

874
01:25:45,763 --> 01:25:47,598
Sorry about that.

875
01:25:47,599 --> 01:25:51,310
That gun...

876
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:54,896
I'll keep it.

877
01:25:54,897 --> 01:25:57,357
Won't allow impulsive shooting.

878
01:25:57,358 --> 01:26:01,069
Big bro.

879
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:02,404
Don't.

880
01:26:02,405 --> 01:26:07,405
Yusuke!

881
01:26:07,493 --> 01:26:11,079
Big bro!

882
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,080
Don't move.

883
01:26:27,555 --> 01:26:32,555
Are you a ghost?

884
01:26:40,109 --> 01:26:45,109
If those boys did well,
I wasn't willing to step in.

885
01:26:47,909 --> 01:26:50,702
Big bro.

886
01:26:50,703 --> 01:26:53,372
Big bro!

887
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:58,373
Sorry about it.

888
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:07,928
Where to?

889
01:27:07,929 --> 01:27:10,347
Kimoto.

890
01:27:10,348 --> 01:27:12,474
What if the purpose of this hijack

891
01:27:12,475 --> 01:27:16,311
was not to release Mido,

892
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:18,814
but to murder him?

893
01:27:18,815 --> 01:27:19,940
How can...?

894
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:21,983
I told you

895
01:27:21,984 --> 01:27:26,984
something is moving
unrelated to you.

896
01:27:56,644 --> 01:28:01,644
Fuel tank will be empty.

897
01:28:03,192 --> 01:28:08,192
Did you think you'd be safe
as long as you sat there?

898
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:36,387
Bunny!

899
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:46,902
The cargo room...

900
01:28:46,903 --> 01:28:51,903
The cargo room. Hurry.

901
01:29:45,878 --> 01:29:47,879
Oh, no...The bomb...the bomb!

902
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:52,880
Cargo room! He's planning to escape.

903
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,975
Run out of fuel

904
01:29:59,976 --> 01:30:03,436
or the bomb explodes.

905
01:30:03,437 --> 01:30:08,437
I wonder which is first.

906
01:30:10,027 --> 01:30:12,487
Nakagawa.

907
01:30:12,488 --> 01:30:16,950
What's going on?

908
01:30:16,951 --> 01:30:21,951
Don't come!

909
01:30:34,427 --> 01:30:37,262
Bunny.

910
01:30:37,263 --> 01:30:42,263
Where is it?

911
01:30:56,198 --> 01:31:01,198
Did I switch it on?

912
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:09,836
If you let go, the thread may break,

913
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,964
or loosen the thread to

914
01:31:12,965 --> 01:31:15,467
neutralize the safety.

915
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:20,468
Either way, bang!

916
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:25,765
Or...

917
01:31:26,062 --> 01:31:31,062
I can push this button.

918
01:31:33,027 --> 01:31:38,027
What do you...?

919
01:31:46,832 --> 01:31:49,209
The parachute...

920
01:31:49,210 --> 01:31:53,380
That's why the low altitude.

921
01:31:53,381 --> 01:31:58,381
Escaping alone?

922
01:31:58,552 --> 01:32:01,638
Sorry for being smart.

923
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:05,517
It works 100 km. away.

924
01:32:05,518 --> 01:32:10,518
When I reach the ground,
I'll push the button.

925
01:32:40,845 --> 01:32:45,845
I wasn't told about
setting a bomb in the plane.

926
01:32:47,268 --> 01:32:49,769
Nakagawa.

927
01:32:49,770 --> 01:32:54,770
My plan from the start.

928
01:32:59,864 --> 01:33:04,367
My dear blue clown,

929
01:33:04,368 --> 01:33:09,368
job well done.

930
01:33:09,999 --> 01:33:14,999
Damn!

931
01:33:19,842 --> 01:33:24,842
Bunny.

932
01:33:50,748 --> 01:33:55,748
Bunny.

933
01:33:57,713 --> 01:34:02,713
Hang on.

934
01:34:51,475 --> 01:34:56,475
Thank you.

935
01:34:59,984 --> 01:35:04,984
Before he lands, we must
do something about this.

936
01:35:14,165 --> 01:35:19,165
Mr. Mido told me
he won't take anybody's life.

937
01:35:21,797 --> 01:35:26,797
That he'll make this a country
where life is valued.

938
01:35:28,971 --> 01:35:33,971
If so,

939
01:35:37,271 --> 01:35:42,271
don't give up.

940
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:51,993
Is anyone an electronics expert?

941
01:35:51,994 --> 01:35:54,287
We need to defuse a bomb.

942
01:35:54,288 --> 01:35:57,248
We need someone,
who knows about electronics.

943
01:35:57,249 --> 01:36:02,249
Is there anybody?

944
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:08,130
Things don't work that conveniently.

945
01:36:31,575 --> 01:36:35,245
Don't, Bunny.
Please not the go-for-broke.

946
01:36:35,246 --> 01:36:37,455
But...

947
01:36:37,456 --> 01:36:42,456
Not that,

948
01:36:46,006 --> 01:36:51,006
I may not look it, but I have
a Master's degree in electronics.

949
01:36:52,388 --> 01:36:56,516
But with the recession,
no company wanted me.

950
01:36:56,517 --> 01:37:00,019
So, I began an IT venture and succeeded.

951
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:05,020
I switched my life to money making.

952
01:37:05,067 --> 01:37:07,068
Satellite transmission.

953
01:37:07,069 --> 01:37:09,153
He said it's good for 100km.

954
01:37:09,154 --> 01:37:13,157
Connects to antenna
for the satellite wave.

955
01:37:13,158 --> 01:37:15,285
Some can be dummies.

956
01:37:15,286 --> 01:37:17,578
Cut one of them?

957
01:37:17,579 --> 01:37:19,664
If you cut this...

958
01:37:19,665 --> 01:37:21,833
Maybe.
Maybe?

959
01:37:21,834 --> 01:37:25,086
There's no blade, so pull one off.

960
01:37:25,087 --> 01:37:26,546
Pull it nicely.

961
01:37:26,547 --> 01:37:31,547
No time. Do it.

962
01:37:37,141 --> 01:37:40,435
Venture business is a gamble.

963
01:37:40,436 --> 01:37:43,771
And I came out a winner.

964
01:37:43,772 --> 01:37:48,772
I have just landed.

965
01:37:52,323 --> 01:37:56,909
Are you positive?

966
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:59,954
Then, it'll be done as scheduled.

967
01:37:59,955 --> 01:38:02,665
Yes.

968
01:38:02,666 --> 01:38:07,666
Job well done.

969
01:38:13,302 --> 01:38:18,302
I hope my luck is still with me.

970
01:39:11,819 --> 01:39:16,819
Thank you.

971
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:19,867
How long

972
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:22,870
will continue winning?

973
01:39:22,871 --> 01:39:25,415
Say...

974
01:39:25,416 --> 01:39:29,836
Must I keep holding this?

975
01:39:29,837 --> 01:39:34,799
Yes, you must.

976
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:39,800
We count on you.

977
01:39:46,603 --> 01:39:50,857
How many more minutes of fuel?

978
01:39:50,858 --> 01:39:55,858
10 min. We must take
the shortest route and land.

979
01:39:57,531 --> 01:40:00,658
Can you hear me?

980
01:40:00,659 --> 01:40:02,326
Bunny...

981
01:40:02,327 --> 01:40:04,245
How's Capt. Kano?

982
01:40:04,246 --> 01:40:09,246
He's wounded and cannot pilot.
Co-pilot is unconscious.

983
01:40:10,461 --> 01:40:14,213
I know there is no time.

984
01:40:14,214 --> 01:40:19,214
I will land this plane.

985
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:21,095
Oh, c'mon.

986
01:40:21,096 --> 01:40:22,472
That's reckless.

987
01:40:22,473 --> 01:40:27,143
Bunny, isn't there
anyone more appropriate?

988
01:40:27,144 --> 01:40:32,144
If there is, why am I here?

989
01:40:32,649 --> 01:40:34,942
What're going to do?

990
01:40:34,943 --> 01:40:37,278
Bunny,

991
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:42,279
you kept something
very important from me.

992
01:40:43,285 --> 01:40:47,079
What could that be?

993
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:51,375
Hurry. What am I to do?

994
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:54,587
Well, what?

995
01:40:54,588 --> 01:40:57,965
Chief!

996
01:40:57,966 --> 01:41:00,468
Bunny,

997
01:41:00,469 --> 01:41:05,469
you must land the place safely.

998
01:41:08,810 --> 01:41:11,479
I Will

999
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:15,483
land this plane.

1000
01:41:15,484 --> 01:41:20,484
It's my duty.

1001
01:41:24,409 --> 01:41:26,577
Bunny.

1002
01:41:26,578 --> 01:41:29,080
Just for basic information.

1003
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:34,081
Have you piloted any small aircraft?
Like a Cessna, for example?

1004
01:41:35,003 --> 01:41:37,505
No.

1005
01:41:37,506 --> 01:41:40,508
Good.

1006
01:41:40,509 --> 01:41:45,509
That way you won't
have any preconception.

1007
01:41:47,391 --> 01:41:50,977
Only, you must listen carefully

1008
01:41:50,978 --> 01:41:53,813
to every word I say to you, and

1009
01:41:53,814 --> 01:41:57,191
precisely follow my directions,

1010
01:41:57,192 --> 01:42:00,403
Am I clear?

1011
01:42:00,404 --> 01:42:02,321
Crystal clear.

1012
01:42:02,322 --> 01:42:06,492
First of all, we will be able to

1013
01:42:06,493 --> 01:42:11,493
guide that plane by radar.

1014
01:42:11,665 --> 01:42:16,377
We can navigate
the plane to the airport.

1015
01:42:16,378 --> 01:42:21,378
So don't touch any instruments,
until I tell you to.

1016
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:27,013
That'll certainly be fine with me.

1017
01:42:27,014 --> 01:42:31,475
In 3 min. you should see
the runway in front of you.

1018
01:42:31,476 --> 01:42:36,476
Look carefully for it.

1019
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:42,320
The fuel is almost gone.

1020
01:42:42,321 --> 01:42:46,907
It's a one-shot deal.

1021
01:42:46,908 --> 01:42:51,908
Okay.

1022
01:42:56,293 --> 01:42:58,753
About the fuel...

1023
01:42:58,754 --> 01:43:01,672
Will it last? I...

1024
01:43:01,673 --> 01:43:06,673
Well? Are you beginning
to see the runway?

1025
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:22,939
I see it.

1026
01:43:23,654 --> 01:43:28,654
Well, then. Let's begin.

1027
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:41,792
First, on the right of
the seat you're sitting in

1028
01:43:42,005 --> 01:43:45,216
<i>there are 2 white levers.</i>

1029
01:43:45,217 --> 01:43:47,426
The throttle levers.

1030
01:43:47,427 --> 01:43:51,055
Slowly pull them to your side.

1031
01:43:51,056 --> 01:43:54,725
Pull until the numbers on the monitor

1032
01:43:54,726 --> 01:43:59,726
in front of you becomes 70.

1033
01:44:06,488 --> 01:44:08,364
You're doing fine.

1034
01:44:08,365 --> 01:44:10,991
Keep it there.

1035
01:44:10,992 --> 01:44:15,992
Next, the white lever next to them.

1036
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,168
Not that.

1037
01:44:21,169 --> 01:44:23,671
On the right side.

1038
01:44:23,672 --> 01:44:27,425
The flap.

1039
01:44:27,426 --> 01:44:29,969
This one, right?

1040
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:31,637
How many?

1041
01:44:31,638 --> 01:44:32,888
Five.

1042
01:44:32,889 --> 01:44:37,889
Okay.

1043
01:44:43,066 --> 01:44:47,820
Now, we lower the nosewheel.

1044
01:44:47,821 --> 01:44:51,198
The wheel-shaped lever in front.

1045
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,492
Pull and lower it.

1046
01:44:53,493 --> 01:44:58,493
The light will turn green.

1047
01:45:00,876 --> 01:45:03,461
It's still red.

1048
01:45:03,462 --> 01:45:05,212
Try once more.

1049
01:45:05,213 --> 01:45:10,176
Yes,

1050
01:45:10,177 --> 01:45:11,886
Still red. No change.

1051
01:45:11,887 --> 01:45:16,474
Once more.

1052
01:45:16,475 --> 01:45:21,475
It changed to green.

1053
01:45:27,235 --> 01:45:32,031
This time,

1054
01:45:32,032 --> 01:45:37,032
Turn the flap to 25.

1055
01:45:41,625 --> 01:45:45,544
What do I do next?

1056
01:45:45,545 --> 01:45:47,254
Captain?

1057
01:45:47,255 --> 01:45:49,757
Captain!

1058
01:45:49,758 --> 01:45:52,510
Captain! Captain!

1059
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:56,514
I'll take over from here.

1060
01:45:56,515 --> 01:46:00,518
Push the control stick slowly forward

1061
01:46:00,519 --> 01:46:02,645
to lower the altitude.

1062
01:46:02,646 --> 01:46:07,646
Lower the throttle
until the numbers become 60.

1063
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:13,030
There's the altitude gage
before the control stick.

1064
01:46:13,031 --> 01:46:18,031
Looking at that, adjust it to 1,000 ft.

1065
01:46:28,463 --> 01:46:33,463
Lower your head.

1066
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:54,530
Darling.

1067
01:46:54,531 --> 01:46:56,699
What are you doing?

1068
01:46:56,700 --> 01:47:01,700
Don't come. Don't come here.

1069
01:48:30,585 --> 01:48:35,585
Please calm yourself.

1070
01:49:03,618 --> 01:49:07,830
We're saved.

1071
01:49:07,831 --> 01:49:12,831
Thanks you, muscle man.

1072
01:49:19,426 --> 01:49:24,426
Please watch your step.

1073
01:50:01,676 --> 01:50:06,676
Apprehended Yusuke Kimoto.

1074
01:50:09,225 --> 01:50:11,518
Yuka.

1075
01:50:11,519 --> 01:50:13,729
I'm a Kyushu woman.

1076
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:18,730
I won't let my husband suffer.

1077
01:50:18,818 --> 01:50:23,818
C'mon. Hold it steady.

1078
01:50:31,915 --> 01:50:36,915
I'm yours forever.

1079
01:51:07,700 --> 01:51:12,700
Please.

1080
01:52:50,678 --> 01:52:55,678
Ah...

1081
01:52:55,975 --> 01:53:00,975
Thank you very much.

1082
01:53:03,816 --> 01:53:08,816
She really did well.

1083
01:53:19,415 --> 01:53:22,000
Bunny!

1084
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:27,001
Bunny!

1085
01:53:31,261 --> 01:53:35,264
Human life is heavier than Earth.

1086
01:53:35,265 --> 01:53:40,265
Minister Kurihara, your words move me.

1087
01:53:40,645 --> 01:53:42,688
It's over now.

1088
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:47,689
Yes, it's over.

1089
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:59,200
I can't

1090
01:54:01,958 --> 01:54:06,958
end it like this.

1091
01:54:09,173 --> 01:54:11,758
Sister!

1092
01:54:11,759 --> 01:54:16,759
Make Way!

1093
01:54:29,277 --> 01:54:31,361
You asked for me?

1094
01:54:31,362 --> 01:54:36,362
I am Kawano. I used to be
METI Minister's secretary.

1095
01:54:36,451 --> 01:54:38,035
Yes, and...

1096
01:54:38,036 --> 01:54:40,329
I must hold a press conference.

1097
01:54:40,330 --> 01:54:45,330
Protect me until that time.

1098
01:54:46,294 --> 01:54:50,881
That's METI Minister
Kurihara's ex-secretary.

1099
01:54:50,882 --> 01:54:54,426
Kurihara will be the next premier.

1100
01:54:54,427 --> 01:54:58,805
Probably wanted to sever the dark ties.

1101
01:54:58,806 --> 01:55:03,806
Kurihara will have
Mido released and then killed.

1102
01:55:03,811 --> 01:55:06,063
Hijack was the tool.

1103
01:55:06,064 --> 01:55:11,064
At the same time,
to silence that ex-secretary,

1104
01:55:11,152 --> 01:55:16,152
he intends to blow up the plane
with all 160 on board.

1105
01:55:16,949 --> 01:55:19,034
What a...

1106
01:55:19,035 --> 01:55:23,205
Those clinging to power,
disregard human life.

1107
01:55:23,206 --> 01:55:25,082
The ones used were...

1108
01:55:25,083 --> 01:55:30,083
Innocent young men.
Absurd and unforgiveable.

1109
01:55:32,673 --> 01:55:37,673
You're righteous for your age.

1110
01:55:41,557 --> 01:55:46,144
It's absolutely unforgiveable.

1111
01:55:46,145 --> 01:55:47,938
There's a short run now.

1112
01:55:47,939 --> 01:55:52,939
Sister.

1113
01:55:58,366 --> 01:56:01,993
Cardiac arrest.

1114
01:56:01,994 --> 01:56:06,994
Sister.

1115
01:56:30,481 --> 01:56:34,776
Minister Kurihara.

1116
01:56:34,777 --> 01:56:39,072
In exchange for Reiko's life

1117
01:56:39,073 --> 01:56:43,743
the bad guys were caught.

1118
01:56:43,744 --> 01:56:48,744
How heavy is the 159 lives
Reiko saved,

1119
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:54,045
staking her life,

1120
01:56:54,046 --> 01:56:59,046
really isn't my concern.

1121
01:57:00,553 --> 01:57:05,553
For me, the fact that Reiko is gone

1122
01:57:05,766 --> 01:57:09,352
cannot be compared to Earth.

1123
01:57:09,353 --> 01:57:14,353
It lost the existence
of the universe itself.

1124
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:20,155
But before that,

1125
01:57:20,156 --> 01:57:25,156
does the universe have
meaning in its existence?

1126
01:58:15,002 --> 01:58:20,002
What will you dream about next?

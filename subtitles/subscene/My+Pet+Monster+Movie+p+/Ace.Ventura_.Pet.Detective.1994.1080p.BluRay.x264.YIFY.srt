1
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
Heads up! Good defense!

2
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,200
Good defense!

3
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,900
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,300
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,100
What do you want?

6
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,200
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. I have a package for you.

7
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
It sounds broken.

8
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,500
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

9
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,500
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

10
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,500
...we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,300
That's a lovely dog.

12
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,200
- Do you mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

13
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,800
Oh, brother!

14
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's fine. I can finish the rest.

15
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,900
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

16
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,300
Excuse me! HDS!

17
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,400
HDS! Coming through!

18
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,100
Got a package, people!

19
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Get away from the door.

20
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

21
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
Son of a bitch!

22
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
That was a close one!

23
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,300
Unfortunately...

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,900
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,700
Hungry, fellow?

26
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
There you go.

27
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,500
No problem. It gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

28
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Or we can try it now.

29
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Putz!

30
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Come on!

31
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,900
Get out! Get out!

32
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,700
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

33
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,500
Give me a push while you're back there.

34
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,700
Alrighty, then!

35
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
It's alive!

36
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,300
It's alive!

37
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,700
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

38
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,300
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

39
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,700
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
gonna hurt my baby, no he's not.

40
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,400
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

41
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,200
How can I ever repay you?

42
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,800
A reward would be good.

43
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,100
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

44
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,600
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

45
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,700
Gee! Let me think.

46
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,300
Sure.

47
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,600
People are real friendly around here.

48
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,700
Ventura!

49
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,500
Yes, Satan?

50
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

51
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,300
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

52
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
You owe me rent.

53
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,600
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

54
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,400
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

55
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,500
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

56
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,100
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

57
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
As soon as I find this bird...

58
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,400
...you're paid.

59
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
I heard animals in there.

60
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,200
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

61
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I never bring my work home with me.

62
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, yeah?

63
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,000
What's all this pet food for?

64
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,900
Fiber.

65
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,900
Wanna take a look inside? Come on!

66
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
Come on!

67
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Go ahead. Snoop around!

68
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Well?

69
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,500
Are you satisfied?

70
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,300
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

71
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,800
All right.

72
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,300
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

73
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,600
Loser!

74
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,500
Come to me, jungle friends.

75
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,600
Roger, let me ask you one question.

76
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,500
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

77
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,100
What?

78
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm sorry, I was just going to say...

79
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,600
...that it's not a fish. It's a mammal.

80
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

81
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,100
She didn't mean anything by that.

82
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,700
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

83
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

84
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,900
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

85
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,800
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

86
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,200
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

87
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,400
You know how superstitious
these players are.

88
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,200
I have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

89
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,500
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

90
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,500
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

91
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

92
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,200
Find the fish...

93
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,100
...or find new jobs!

94
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,200
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

95
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

96
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Always out with their signs:

97
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,500
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

98
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,800
That fish lives better than they do.

99
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,700
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

100
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,200
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

101
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,200
...I hired a pet detective.

102
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
A what?

103
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,600
A pet detective.

104
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

105
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,400
Well, actually, he was quite good.

106
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,300
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

107
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
Like a glove!

108
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,800
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

109
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,900
Thanks, Martha.

110
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,700
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,200
Pleasure to meet you.

112
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,400
Any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,800
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,000
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

115
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll get right to the point.

116
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,900
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

117
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,300
Negative.

118
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,200
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

119
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,800
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

120
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
<i>Let's go.</i>

121
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,200
<i>Blue 42, blue 42!</i>

122
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,600
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

123
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,300
<i>All right!</i>

124
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,200
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

125
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,700
<i>Good boy!</i>

126
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Would you like an ashtray?

127
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,600
I don't smoke.

128
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,900
It's a disgusting habit.

129
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,300
The police came today.

130
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,700
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a...

131
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,100
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

132
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
Roger, how you holding up?

133
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,400
If I'm walking funny it's because
I got two dozen reporters up my ass.

134
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,700
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

135
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,000
Who's he?

136
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

137
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,700
He's our pet detective.

138
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

139
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,400
Martha Mertz?

140
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

141
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,200
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when I found her.

142
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,800
Is that the tank?

143
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,800
Excuse me.

144
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,200
- Cops drain it?
- Yes, this morning.

145
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,300
If I'm not back in five minutes...

146
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,000
...just wait longer.

147
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:33,100
Captain's log, stardate 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

148
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,500
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

149
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,900
So far...

150
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,400
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it.

151
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,900
If I have to tear another black hole,
I'm going to find it!

152
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,700
I've got to, mister!

153
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,100
Oh, great!

154
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,300
I'll try to head them off.

155
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Ace, get out of the tank.

156
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,400
I just can't do it, captain!

157
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,500
I don't have the power!

158
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
People!

159
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,900
I said, get out of the tank now!

160
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,800
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man!

161
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Where's Snowflake?

162
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Snowflake is not available right now.

163
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,300
Roger, I've been waiting all day.
I got to get a shot of his new trick!

164
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,100
What, is he sick?

165
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,200
People, people!

166
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,300
Lassie must be missing.

167
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,500
Make any good collars lately?

168
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,500
Or were they leashes?

169
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Homicide, Ventura.

170
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
How are you gonna solve that one?

171
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Good question, Aguado!

172
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,500
First, I'd establish a motive.

173
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:06,500
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

174
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,500
Then I'd lose 30 pounds
porking his wife!

175
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
Come on!

176
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,900
Now, kiss and make up!

177
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,500
Excuse me.

178
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,300
I'd like to ass you a few questions.

179
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,300
This is not the time, Ace.

180
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,200
If Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

181
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,500
I can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

182
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,200
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

183
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,800
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

184
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,500
Five minutes alone, that's all I need!

185
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,500
Better look alive.
Einhorn's on her way down.

186
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,200
Come on, now. Ace, please.

187
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,600
What's that matter?
Afraid I'll make a stink? Come on!

188
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,100
Aguado's working the case, all right?

189
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,500
Aguado!

190
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,000
Good call!

191
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
We're just a little busy now...

192
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,400
...with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

193
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,600
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

194
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,200
Now you've pissed him off.

195
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,600
- Would you give me a break?
- I can't hold him much longer!

196
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,900
My boss is coming!

197
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,000
Okay, look.

198
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,000
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

199
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,400
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

200
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,800
So far, nothing, nathin', <i>nada.</i>
All right?

201
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,300
Any unusual bets being made?

202
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

203
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,400
- What'd you find out about the tank?
- Nothing.

204
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,900
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

205
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,600
- That's it?
- I swear.

206
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,100
Now will you please get out of here
before I get in trouble?

207
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,300
Thank you for your cooperation.

208
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,500
By the way, do you have a mint?

209
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
Perhaps some Binaca?

210
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,900
<i>Assholomio</i>

211
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,000
<i>Osadomia</i>

212
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,500
Holy testicle Tuesday!

213
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,900
What the hell is he doing here?

214
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,700
I came to confess.

215
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,500
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

216
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,700
Spare me the routine. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

217
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,800
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

218
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,300
We'll find the porpoise.

219
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,800
Now I feel better.

220
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Of course, that might not do any good.

221
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,900
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
It's a dolphin that's been taken.

222
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,800
The common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

223
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,100
...while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncatus...

224
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,800
...has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

225
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,800
But I'm sure you already knew that.

226
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,400
That's what turns me on about you.

227
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,200
Your attention to detail.

228
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,800
Listen, pet dick...

229
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

230
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,300
Well, I'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

231
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,500
But thank you for asking.

232
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

233
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,700
Your number still 911?

234
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,800
Alrighty, then!

235
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,200
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

236
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
Thank you!

237
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,100
What's the password?

238
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
New England clam chowder.

239
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,100
Is that the red or the white?

240
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,300
I can never remember that!

241
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,500
White?

242
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,600
Hey, Woodstock!

243
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,100
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

244
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,800
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

245
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Do you?

246
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,500
Don't I?

247
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
So what are you up to?

248
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,300
Just watching the fishies.

249
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,700
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

250
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

251
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

252
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,300
...before they find any whales.

253
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,100
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

254
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,700
Of course I can. Why?

255
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,100
I wanna trace the sale of equipment...

256
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,300
...for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

257
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,700
Come on, I thought you had
a challenge for me.

258
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,700
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank...

259
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,000
Wait a minute. Look here.

260
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,100
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

261
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,200
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

262
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

263
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,900
Really?

264
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,200
That is the face of the enemy.

265
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,200
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

266
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Hold on.

267
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,000
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

268
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,900
That subgenius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

269
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,300
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

270
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,300
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

271
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

272
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,200
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

273
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,000
If you do anything to embarrass me...

274
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,100
What? Like this?

275
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,200
Hi, Captain Stubing.

276
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,000
How are Gopher and Doc?

277
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Permission to come aboard, sir.

278
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm sorry, ladies.

279
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,700
Glad you could make it.

280
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,400
Thank you.

281
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,000
You look wonderful.

282
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,000
And who is he, a friend?

283
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,200
No, this is...
This is my date.

284
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,800
He's a lawyer.

285
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,100
Does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

286
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,100
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...

287
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,000
Tom Ace.

288
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,400
Pleasure to meet you.

289
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Congratulations on all your success.

290
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,400
You smell terrific!

291
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,600
One of the first lessons we learned...

292
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,900
...back at...

293
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,300
...Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

294
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,900
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

295
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,300
...with little else.

296
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
How is everybody feeling tonight?

297
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,400
Very, very well, thank you.

298
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,500
Look, honey...

299
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,500
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

300
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,400
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

301
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What are you trying to do?

302
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,800
Will you keep him occupied
while I work my magic, please?

303
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,300
Smooshy, isn't it?

304
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,900
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

305
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,500
Excuse me, Ron...

306
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
...I need to use the bathroom.

307
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
I think it's the pâté.

308
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,200
Sure, it's over there.

309
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,100
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

310
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,100
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

311
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,500
Gravy!

312
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,800
Don't worry, Snowflake.

313
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,700
Ace Ventura's here.

314
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,300
Yummy!

315
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,900
Snowflake!

316
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,000
Here, Snowflake.

317
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
I've got a snack for you.

318
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,600
They're wonderful, aren't they?

319
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Yes, they certainly are.

320
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
No matter what's going on in my life...

321
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,700
...I can always watch them swim...

322
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,300
...and be totally at peace.

323
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,300
It's not Snowflake!

324
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,800
It's not Snowflake!

325
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,000
It's not Snowflake!

326
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,900
Are you sure your date is all right?

327
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,000
It's been an awfully long time.

328
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,600
Who, Tom?

329
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,100
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

330
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
Do not go in there!

331
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:46,400
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

332
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,700
Do that! If I'd been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

333
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,100
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

334
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,400
What're you doing?

335
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,100
I'm sorry, Ron.

336
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,700
What's he doing?

337
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
Let's go!

338
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,200
Stop it!

339
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,500
I don't even wanna know
why your pants are missing!

340
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
You could've cost me my job!

341
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,800
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

342
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,200
I found it in the filter, thank you.

343
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,000
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

344
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,300
What're you talking about?

345
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,800
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

346
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,200
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

347
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,800
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

348
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,100
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

349
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,200
Ring? What ring?

350
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,200
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

351
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,900
I find the ring with a missing stone,
I find Snowflake.

352
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
How you gonna do that?

353
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,200
Simple.

354
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,400
Loser!

355
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,800
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

356
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,100
You wanna play?

357
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,400
Damn it!

358
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,900
That stone could've come from anywhere.

359
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
It could've come from...

360
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,000
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

361
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,600
It came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

362
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:12,600
Einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

363
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

364
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Over half a million members worldwide?

365
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
No. Who are they?

366
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,300
Did you know...

367
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,800
...they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

368
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,600
What do you feed your dog?

369
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,400
Dog food. Why?

370
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,000
He is miserable!

371
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,000
What are you talking about?

372
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,200
He's very unhappy. I feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

373
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,600
It's amazing he's still alive.

374
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,800
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

375
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,400
You can't express anger.

376
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,300
Yeah? And you're ugly.

377
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm not even gonna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

378
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Why? So you can beat him?

379
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Fatty!

380
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,800
You're unbelievable!

381
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,200
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

382
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,300
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

383
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,800
You like her, huh?

384
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,400
Yeah, she's all right.

385
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,000
Look, Melissa, I...

386
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,900
I'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

387
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,800
...where Roger Podacter, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

388
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,200
...has apparently committed suicide...

389
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,200
...allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony...

390
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,700
You okay?

391
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,600
I told you. I was in my apartment...

392
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,000
...across the hall.

393
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,400
I heard a scream...

394
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,600
...so I called the manager.

395
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,500
The place was empty, except for the dog.

396
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,200
I opened the balcony door
and looked out...

397
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,600
...splat, bang, pancake time.

398
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,000
Okay, thank you very much.

399
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,600
Hi there, fella.

400
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,300
Have a bad night?

401
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,400
So...

402
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,800
...animals can sense evil.

403
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,900
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

404
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,700
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

405
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,800
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

406
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,500
Face it...

407
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
Forget it. She's right.

408
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,100
Besides...

409
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,800
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

410
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,700
So...

411
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,700
...you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

412
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,600
I wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

413
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,200
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

414
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,300
May I tell you what I think happened?

415
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,900
Alrighty, then!

416
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,800
Roger Podacter went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

417
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,800
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

418
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,600
...and he was thrown over that balcony.

419
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,400
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

420
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,400
He was murdered.

421
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,400
That's a very entertaining story...

422
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,900
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

423
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,700
...evidence.

424
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,100
I think I heard a toilet flush.

425
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,600
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

426
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,800
Well, I...

427
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,700
I guess I'm out of my league here.

428
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,400
Good work.

429
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,700
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

430
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,500
This woman is Roger Podacter's neighbor.

431
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,000
She said she heard a scream. Right?

432
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,200
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

433
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,000
- That's true.
- You're sure you had to open this door?

434
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm certain.

435
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,500
What's the point, Ventura?

436
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,100
Only this.

437
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,200
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

438
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,000
...she could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

439
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,600
The scream she heard
came from inside...

440
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,800
...before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

441
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,900
Can you feel that, buddy?

442
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,300
I have exorcized the demons!

443
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,000
This house is clear.

444
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,000
- Losers.
- Get him out of here!

445
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,800
- Losers! Losers!
- Let's go, Ace.

446
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,700
Losers.

447
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
Come on.

448
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,300
Back to the zoo.

449
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,000
What are you thinking?

450
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,100
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

451
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,300
I want to find that other ring.

452
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,300
Ace, you checked all the rings.

453
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,800
Receipts? What about receipts?

454
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,700
There's gotta be receipts.

455
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,200
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

456
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,600
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,600
I was there.

458
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,500
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

459
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,700
I don't do humans.

460
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,600
You really love animals.

461
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,100
If it gets cold enough.

462
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,700
No, I have a kinship with them.

463
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,400
I understand them.

464
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,400
Wanna hear something spooky?

465
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,800
Sure.

466
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:06,900
One time when I was about 12, I had
a dream that I was being followed by...

467
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,900
...a big dog with rabies.

468
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,100
He had these bloodshot eyes...

469
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,100
...and foam came out of his mouth.

470
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,500
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

471
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,600
Then just before I got
to my front door...

472
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,400
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

473
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,300
That's when I woke up...

474
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,700
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

475
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,200
Bastard!

476
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,300
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

477
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,800
Want to know why I do this?

478
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,800
I'm not sure anymore.

479
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,500
You better be sure...

480
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,700
...because once you get
inside my head...

481
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,700
...there's no turning back.

482
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,300
So...

483
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:10,500
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

484
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,800
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

485
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,700
Who the hell is that?

486
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,400
What?

487
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,700
That.

488
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
Who the hell is that?

489
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,400
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

490
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,900
Why isn't he in this picture?

491
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,200
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

492
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,200
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

493
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,100
Cost the Dolphins the game.

494
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,700
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

495
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,300
Definitely.

496
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,400
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

497
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,300
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

498
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,900
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

499
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,000
"The kick heard round the world."

500
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,600
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

501
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,600
Poor guy.

502
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,100
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

503
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,000
Where is he now?

504
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,400
I heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

505
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,000
Really?

506
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,300
You're gonna drop me off before you go?

507
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,900
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

508
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,800
It might not be safe at your apartment.

509
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,300
What do you suggest?

510
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,300
Oh, my God!

511
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,800
Oh, my God.

512
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,100
Three times?

513
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,400
I'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

514
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,000
I must be tired.

515
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,200
Okay, I'm ready again.

516
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,300
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

517
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,300
...and a clean pair of shorts.

518
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,500
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

519
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,700
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

520
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,700
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

521
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,500
Most points and distance.

522
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,600
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

523
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,700
And one hell of a model American.

524
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,200
Are you another one of them
<i>Hard Copy</i> guys?

525
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
No, sir.

526
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,200
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

527
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,200
This is my Graceland, sir.

528
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,200
Will you put that gun down?

529
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,800
The boy is a fan of our son.

530
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,700
So nice to meet you.

531
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,500
I'm Ray's mother...

532
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,400
...and this is Ray's father.

533
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,000
It's a real honor!

534
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,500
It's an honor to have you here.

535
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,100
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

536
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,900
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

537
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,300
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

538
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

539
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,200
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

540
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,100
Yummy!

541
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,500
Ray Finkle's house.

542
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,500
I can't wait to meet him.

543
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,400
Ray ain't coming home.

544
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,300
But your wife expects him any minute.

545
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,100
She expects him home any minute.

546
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,000
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

547
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:27,600
Eight years ago...

548
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,900
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

549
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,000
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

550
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:38,900
It was all that Dan Marino's fault.
Everyone knows that.

551
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,500
If he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

552
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:45,100
...Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

553
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,600
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

554
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,900
Would you like a cookie, son?

555
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,100
What do you know?

556
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,500
They're little footballs.

557
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,100
Laces out.

558
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,500
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

559
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,100
...he'll never even know he was gone.

560
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,200
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

561
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,100
Oh, boy!

562
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,100
What a sports nut, huh?

563
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
May I?

564
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,200
Oh, yes, by all means.

565
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:59,000
<i>Five seconds to go here</i>
<i>in Super Bowl 17.</i>

566
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,100
<i>Dolphins trailing the 49ers...</i>

567
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,000
<i>... by one. This will</i>
<i>win the game for Miami.</i>

568
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,000
<i>There's the snap.</i>

569
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,400
<i>Marino holds.</i>

570
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,900
<i>The kick...</i>

571
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,600
<i>... and it's high. No, it's...</i>

572
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,700
<i>... no good.</i>

573
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:17,900
<i>Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!</i>

574
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,000
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

575
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,900
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>

576
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,400
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>
<i>The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!</i>

577
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,400
- Melissa, it's Ace!
<i>- Where are you?</i>

578
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,300
I'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

579
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,700
Why?

580
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,100
He's about to join Snowflake.
I've gotta know where he is!

581
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,500
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

582
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,800
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

583
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,000
Ace, what's going on?

584
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,200
Thought I left?

585
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,100
I'm really gonna go this time.

586
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,900
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

587
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,000
Action!

588
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,300
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

589
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,600
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

590
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,600
...with Isotoner gloves!

591
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:26,800
Cut! Again from the top.

592
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,100
I said, cut!

593
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,600
Guys, it's a cut!

594
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,200
What the hell are they doing?

595
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,100
That's a cut!

596
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,700
- What is this, a rewrite?
- Shut up!

597
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,600
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!

598
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,800
Let's go!

599
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,500
Excuse me, gentlemen!

600
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,900
Pet detective!

601
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Come on!

602
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,100
What's wrong?

603
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,800
Can't you hit me?

604
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,200
Have there been ransom demands?

605
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,900
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

606
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:46,100
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

607
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,800
The game is on as scheduled.

608
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,000
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

609
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

610
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,500
- Are the crimes related?
- I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

611
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,600
Now, if you'll excuse me...

612
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,900
Get me the autopsy on Podacter!

613
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,000
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

614
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,800
And somebody get me some coffee!

615
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,900
Tonight on <i>Miami Vice,</i>
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!

616
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,400
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

617
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,100
Is it number one or number two?

618
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,600
I just wanna know how much time I have.

619
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,600
By the way,
I went ahead and solved that...

620
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,800
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-
Marino thing.

621
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,200
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

622
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:45,900
All right, Ventura...

623
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,300
...make it quick.

624
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,800
I found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

625
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,700
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

626
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,100
It would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

627
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,300
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

628
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:05,200
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room.

629
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,700
Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

630
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,800
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

631
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,100
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

632
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:20,900
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

633
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,000
Finkle took it personally.

634
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,100
So where is Finkle now?

635
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,800
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

636
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,700
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

637
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,800
The time when it'd hurt them most:

638
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,200
Super Bowl time.

639
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,800
Man, I'm tired of being right!

640
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,800
Congratulations.

641
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,900
You've done some fine detective work...

642
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,900
...Ace.

643
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,200
I'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

644
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,600
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

645
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,800
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

646
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,600
Your gun is digging into my hip.

647
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,300
What's wrong?

648
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,000
Want me to read you your rights?

649
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,600
Maybe later.

650
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,900
What is it?

651
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,800
That bony little bitch...

652
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,700
...Melissa Robinson?

653
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,500
You just don't do anything for me.

654
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,200
Down, boy!

655
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,000
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

656
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,100
Fine, sergeant.

657
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,200
You want me to throw him out?

658
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,500
Why don't you throw yourself out?

659
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,800
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

661
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,500
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

662
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,400
When we find Marino...

663
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,700
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

664
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,000
When I find Snowflake...

665
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,200
...I'll deliver Marino.

666
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,600
Melissa, it's Ace!

667
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,700
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

668
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,500
You have to commit me.

669
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,100
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

670
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,600
They aren't gonna let us look around.

671
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
I know.

672
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,000
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

673
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,300
Mrs. Robinson...

674
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,700
...I'm Dr. Handly.

675
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,400
Now who is it you want us to look at?

676
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,900
My brother...

677
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,700
...Larry.

678
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:00,400
I'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

679
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,600
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

680
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,600
Just gotta stay positive.

681
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:10,900
I'm gonna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

682
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,200
Let's see that...

683
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,100
...in an instant replay.

684
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,800
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

685
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,700
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're very sensitive...

686
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,400
...to the stress athletes
have to endure.

687
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,700
I'm open! I'm open!

688
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,200
I'm open!

689
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,500
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

690
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,000
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

691
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:18,800
Over here!

692
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,700
351!

693
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,000
351!

694
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,200
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

695
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,400
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

696
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,000
Has he had a history of mental illness?

697
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,200
As long as I've known him.

698
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,800
This is one of our therapy rooms.

699
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,100
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

700
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,300
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...

701
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,000
Halftime!

702
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,900
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

703
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,800
I'll show you the dormitories, then.

704
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:29,300
Isotoners.

705
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:51,100
Obsess much?

706
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,300
Where are you going?

707
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,600
- To clean the storage room.
- No, clean the cafeteria.

708
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,900
I don't tell you how to do your job.

709
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,700
The schedule says...

710
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,400
...clean the cafeteria.
- I know what I'm doing.

711
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,900
You should've done it earlier.

712
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:09,400
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
I'm cleaning in here!

713
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,700
You take breaks too long. You smoke...

714
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,200
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

715
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,500
"Search called off for missing hiker."

716
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,700
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

717
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,500
...were unable to find the body
of Lois Einhorn."

718
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,300
A hiker missing since Friday?

719
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,100
Lois Einhorn?

720
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,100
Holy shitballs!

721
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,700
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

722
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,100
"Love, Roger"?

723
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,900
<i>Ace, it's E.</i>

724
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,300
<i>You think the article you found</i>
<i>was something?</i>

725
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,000
<i>I got a note from Roger to Einhorn...</i>

726
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,600
<i>... thanking her for a wonderful evening.</i>

727
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,500
<i>Something ain't stirring</i>
<i>the Kool-Aid, man.</i>

728
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,600
Wiggles, rewind.

729
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,100
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

730
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,500
Come on, think!

731
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,900
Finkle and Einhorn, in it together.
How? Why?

732
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,600
All right! Here we go.

733
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,000
Answer's right there!
Just gotta get blood to the brain!

734
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,300
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

735
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,900
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

736
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,400
Quitter!

737
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,400
What do you want?

738
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,500
I don't have any food for you.

739
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,700
I have to have money to buy food.

740
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:09,300
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

741
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,000
Let's face it...

742
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,300
...your master is a loser.

743
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,400
What the?

744
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,200
That's it.

745
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,000
That's it!

746
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:50,700
Einhorn is Finkle.

747
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,400
Finkle is Einhorn!

748
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,000
Einhorn is a man!

749
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,500
Oh, my God!

750
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,600
Einhorn is a man!

751
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,500
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

752
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,900
God!

753
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:10,000
<i>And the big story in this</i>
<i>Super Bowl game is the abduction...</i>

754
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,400
<i>... of Miami's starting quarterback,</i>
<i>Dan Marino.</i>

755
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,700
<i>It's gotta be a strain</i>
<i>on this Miami team, Bob...</i>

756
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,600
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

757
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,600
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

758
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:05,200
A magical afternoon...

759
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,800
...where dreams are made...

760
01:09:08,900 --> 01:09:10,400
...and crushed.

761
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:14,200
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

762
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,300
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

763
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,700
...met someplace before?

764
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,700
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

765
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,400
<i>Now the coin toss.</i>

766
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,400
Kickoff time.

767
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,000
My favorite thing.

768
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:40,200
Laces out!

769
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,000
I made some refreshments, Dan.

770
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,800
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

771
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I'll be right back, Dan.

772
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,400
I don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but I'll double it.

773
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,800
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

774
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:50,800
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

775
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,700
Check it out, Marino.

776
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:55,200
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

777
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,500
Damn!

778
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:08,500
Go get some more fish!

779
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,400
I'm gonna kill that dolphin.

780
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,300
Lovely party.

781
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,300
Pity I wasn't invited.

782
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,900
Where the hell's the smelt?

783
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,900
Unconscious. Exactly as I planned.

784
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,100
What the hell was that?

785
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,300
Shit!

786
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
What happened? What's going on?

787
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,200
You okay?

788
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:13,800
Guess what?

789
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,300
It's naptime!

790
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,400
<i>What a hit!</i>

791
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:23,700
Heads up!

792
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,100
Who are you?

793
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,800
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

794
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,700
The quarterback sneak.

795
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,600
Penalty!

796
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:43,000
Too many men on the field.

797
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
I warned you, Ventura.

798
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:47,900
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

799
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,900
Good question.

800
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:55,000
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumor.

801
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,900
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

802
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,900
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

803
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,600
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

804
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,700
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

805
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,600
<i>Code 11 in progress,</i>
<i>343 Victorville Road...</i>

806
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,400
<i>... at the Palmdale basin.</i>

807
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,900
<i>Officer needs backup.</i>
<i>Suspect's name: Ace Ventura...</i>

808
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,700
<i>... should be considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

809
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:26,100
It's Ace. We gotta break out of here.

810
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,100
Is he in trouble?

811
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,800
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

812
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,200
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

813
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,100
Don't kill me!

814
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,400
Please!

815
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,200
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

816
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,800
- He's who you want! Kill him!
- Kill him!

817
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,800
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

818
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:51,600
Come on, look at him!

819
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,100
- Crybaby!
- Jock!

820
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:54,300
- Wimp.
- Musclehead.

821
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,000
Shut up!

822
01:13:56,300 --> 01:14:00,700
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

823
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,000
<i>And there's the snap.</i>

824
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:04,200
<i>The kick!</i>

825
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,500
<i>And it's good!</i>

826
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,600
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

827
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:19,000
What would you know about pressure?

828
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:21,800
Well, I have kissed a man.

829
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:27,200
<i>Of course, there's never been</i>
<i>a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...</i>

830
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,700
<i>... than the "kick</i>
<i>heard around the world."</i>

831
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:35,300
<i>I mean, it's clear to me that it was</i>
<i>a good hold. Finkle just booted it.</i>

832
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,900
The laces were in!

833
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,000
They were in!

834
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:01,900
You like that?

835
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:03,300
You like that?

836
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,700
And that! And that!

837
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,600
Having a little trouble with the lady?

838
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,500
You don't understand...

839
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,900
...she's a...

840
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,900
Get him, Lois! Get him!

841
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,200
Get him!

842
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,900
Shoot him!

843
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
- Shoot him!
- Hold your fire!

844
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,000
Don't shoot!

845
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,400
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

846
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,700
I mean it!

847
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,300
She's not joking!

848
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,100
He kidnapped Snowflake!

849
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:05,900
He killed Roger Podacter and was about
to kill Marino and me!

850
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,300
Fiction can be fun!

851
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,500
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

852
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,100
For instance...

853
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,600
...if you look up...

854
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,300
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

855
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,300
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

856
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:31,200
...who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

857
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:37,900
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

858
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,400
...only to escape and join the police...

859
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,900
...in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

860
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,300
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

861
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,500
What are you talking about?

862
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:54,900
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

863
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,200
He's lying!

864
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,700
Shoot him!

865
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:04,000
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

866
01:17:04,200 --> 01:17:08,200
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

867
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:16,300
Boy, that's really on there!

868
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,600
But tell me this:

869
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,400
Would a real woman...

870
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,800
...be missing these?

871
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,200
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

872
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:33,500
But I doubt very much...

873
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,800
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

874
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,400
...to get rid of...

875
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,700
...big old...

876
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:42,500
...Mr. Knish!

877
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,900
Oh, boy!

878
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,100
Come here.

879
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:59,800
Would you excuse me for just one second?

880
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,800
Ladies and gentlemen...

881
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:13,300
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

882
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:16,300
...brought new evidence to my attention.

883
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,500
Now...

884
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,800
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

885
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,900
...criminal investigator can be wrong.

886
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,100
But if I am mistaken...

887
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:30,500
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

888
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,000
...as she claims to be...

889
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,400
...then, my friend...

890
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,300
...she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!

891
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,100
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

892
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:45,800
He found Captain Winkie!

893
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,100
Good night!

894
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:59,900
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

895
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:06,900
Die, animal boy!

896
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,100
Quick decision.

897
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,600
Loser!

898
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,000
You have any more gum?

899
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:45,600
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

900
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:49,000
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

901
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,900
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

902
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:55,000
<i>... the Miami Dolphins are proud...</i>

903
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:58,000
<i>... to welcome back</i>
<i>to Joe Robbie Stadium...</i>

904
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,900
<i>... our beloved mascot...</i>

905
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:02,900
<i>... and the star of our halftime show:</i>

906
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,900
<i>Snowflake!</i>

907
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:13,500
<i>And now...</i>

908
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:17,400
<i>... returning for the second half,</i>
<i>the Dolphins' most valuable player...</i>

909
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,200
<i>... Dan Marino!</i>

910
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,100
Idiot!

911
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:13,100
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

912
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:15,300
Yeah? Blow me!

913
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,300
Really?

914
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:35,300
<i>The National Football League...</i>

915
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:40,300
<i>... would like to offer a special thank-</i>
<i>you to the man who rescued Dan Marino...</i>

916
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,000
<i>... and our beloved Snowflake.</i>

917
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,200
<i>A great humanitarian...</i>

918
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,500
<i>... and a lover of all animals:</i>

919
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,900
<i>Mr. Ace Ventura!</i>

920
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:53,400
Get off me!

921
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,400
Get off me!

922
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:05,700
<i>Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on</i>
<i>and kick it for the homies.</i>

1
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:05,633
Heads up! Good defense!

2
00:01:05,887 --> 00:01:07,262
Good defense!

3
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:05,951
We're going downtown.

4
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:18,342
Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!

5
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,128
What do you want?

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:25,267
HDS, sir. How are you this afternoon?
Alrighty. I have a package for you.

7
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:29,852
It sounds broken.

8
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,571
Most likely. I'll bet it was something
nice. This is an insurance form.

9
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:37,576
If you'll just sign here,
here, and here...

10
00:02:37,827 --> 00:02:40,532
...we'll get the rest of the forms
to you soon.

11
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,329
That's a lovely dog.

12
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:50,206
- Do you mind if I pet him?
- I don't give a rat's ass.

13
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,807
Oh, brother!

14
00:03:04,024 --> 00:03:06,064
That's fine. I can finish the rest.

15
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,902
You just have yourself a good day.
Take care now. Bye-bye.

16
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:24,372
Excuse me! HDS!

17
00:03:24,632 --> 00:03:26,459
HDS! Coming through!

18
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,128
Got a package, people!

19
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,105
Get away from the door.

20
00:03:47,617 --> 00:03:50,618
What's the matter with you?
I said, get!

21
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,789
Son of a bitch!

22
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,995
That was a close one!

23
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,336
Unfortunately...

24
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:04,925
...in every contest
there must be a loser.

25
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:17,730
Hungry, fellow?

26
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:23,735
There you go.

27
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:31,540
No problem. It gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.

28
00:04:33,128 --> 00:04:34,788
Or we can try it now.

29
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,126
Putz!

30
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:37,419
Come on!

31
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:39,918
Get out! Get out!

32
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:45,717
Warning: Assholes
are closer than they appear!

33
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,597
Give me a push while you're back there.

34
00:04:54,653 --> 00:04:56,729
Alrighty, then!

35
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,362
It's alive!

36
00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:03,328
It's alive!

37
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:51,715
My little baby, come here.
You missed Mommy, didn't you?

38
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,383
Yes, you did. Did Daddy hurt you?
I won't let him. No, I won't.

39
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:01,727
He can keep the big TV, but he's not
gonna hurt my baby, no he's not.

40
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,442
Thank you, Mr. Ventura.

41
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:12,241
How can I ever repay you?

42
00:06:12,493 --> 00:06:13,822
A reward would be good.

43
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,124
There is some damage to my car,
and I had to fill it with premium.

44
00:06:21,587 --> 00:06:24,672
Would you like for me
to take your pants off instead?

45
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:28,721
Gee! Let me think.

46
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:30,300
Sure.

47
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,687
People are real friendly around here.

48
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:39,788
Ventura!

49
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,501
Yes, Satan?

50
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:47,541
I'm sorry, sir.
You sounded like someone else.

51
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:50,331
Never mind the wisecracks, Ventura.

52
00:08:52,888 --> 00:08:54,347
You owe me rent.

53
00:08:54,557 --> 00:08:57,677
Mr. Shickadance, I told you,
you're my first priority.

54
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:01,471
I'm on a very big case right now.
Check this out.

55
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,526
Look at that.
That's a true albino pigeon.

56
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:08,111
Some rich guy lost it.
He's offering a $25,000 reward.

57
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:10,322
As soon as I find this bird...

58
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:11,489
...you're paid.

59
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,200
I heard animals in there.

60
00:09:14,455 --> 00:09:17,243
I heard them again this morning,
scratching around.

61
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,498
I never bring my work home with me.

62
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,040
Oh, yeah?

63
00:09:21,338 --> 00:09:24,090
What's all this pet food for?

64
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:25,964
Fiber.

65
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:29,922
Wanna take a look inside? Come on!

66
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:31,880
Come on!

67
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,274
Go ahead. Snoop around!

68
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:00,539
Well?

69
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,509
Are you satisfied?

70
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:09,350
Just don't let me catch you
with an animal in here. That's all.

71
00:10:09,602 --> 00:10:10,848
All right.

72
00:10:11,104 --> 00:10:13,393
Take care, now. Bye-bye, then.

73
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:16,640
Loser!

74
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,594
Come to me, jungle friends.

75
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:03,658
Roger, let me ask you one question.

76
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:06,585
How in hell do you lose
a 500-pound fish?

77
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:09,168
What?

78
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,623
I'm sorry, I was just going to say...

79
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:14,677
...that it's not a fish. It's a mammal.

80
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:17,046
Thank you, Miss Jacques Cousteau.

81
00:11:17,473 --> 00:11:19,181
She didn't mean anything by that.

82
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:22,720
I don't give a good goddamn
about that fish!

83
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:25,346
Fillet it and fast-food it
if you want to!

84
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:28,935
All I give a damn about is
winning the Super Bowl!

85
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:32,819
My athletes have got to have
their heads in the right place!

86
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:37,245
Shit, Roger! You've been
in this business a long time.

87
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:40,493
You know how superstitious
these players are.

88
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:45,213
I have a quarterback that's put his
socks on backwards since high school.

89
00:11:45,464 --> 00:11:49,545
I've got a linebacker that hasn't washed
his jockey strap in two years...

90
00:11:49,802 --> 00:11:52,508
...because he thinks flies are lucky.

91
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:56,466
I want that fish on that field
Super Bowl Sunday.

92
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:58,222
Find the fish...

93
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:00,139
...or find new jobs!

94
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:03,269
Why did it happen now,
two weeks before the Super Bowl?

95
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:06,439
I'll tell you, it's those
animal-rights activists!

96
00:12:06,655 --> 00:12:08,399
Always out with their signs:

97
00:12:08,658 --> 00:12:11,576
"Animals were born free!
Stop torturing Snowflake!"

98
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:13,863
That fish lives better than they do.

99
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:18,743
The police are checking into the animal-
rights groups. Have they called back?

100
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:22,247
No, but I wanted to tell you,
when I lost my Cuddles...

101
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,299
...I hired a pet detective.

102
00:12:24,885 --> 00:12:25,881
A what?

103
00:12:26,303 --> 00:12:28,629
A pet detective.

104
00:12:30,058 --> 00:12:33,012
Thanks, Martha, but we better
leave this to professionals.

105
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,435
Well, actually, he was quite good.

106
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:40,316
Pet detection is a very involved,
highly scientific process.

107
00:13:34,716 --> 00:13:36,543
Like a glove!

108
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,895
Mr. Ventura here to see you.

109
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:50,973
Thanks, Martha.

110
00:13:51,194 --> 00:13:52,771
Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson.

111
00:13:52,987 --> 00:13:54,268
Pleasure to meet you.

112
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,401
Any trouble getting in?

113
00:13:56,742 --> 00:14:00,870
No, the guy with the rubber glove
was surprisingly gentle.

114
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:03,039
Security's tight Super Bowl week.

115
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,626
Why don't you have a seat?
I'll get right to the point.

116
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:12,965
Our mascot was stolen from his tank last
night. Are you familiar with Snowflake?

117
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,382
Negative.

118
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:18,256
We got him from Miami.
He's a rare bottle-nosed dolphin.

119
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:21,809
This is a new trick he was
going to do for the halftime show.

120
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:23,012
<i>Let's go.</i>

121
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:25,265
<i>Blue 42, blue 42!</i>

122
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,688
<i>Hut, hut!</i>

123
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:31,361
<i>All right!</i>

124
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,282
<i>Come on, let's go!</i>

125
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:44,789
<i>Good boy!</i>

126
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:54,683
Would you like an ashtray?

127
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:57,640
I don't smoke.

128
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,972
It's a disgusting habit.

129
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,364
The police came today.

130
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:10,778
Apparently, the kidnappers
came in through the back with a...

131
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,199
Four-wheel-drive van,
loaded from the rear.

132
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,203
Roger, how you holding up?

133
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:21,460
If I'm walking funny it's because
I got two dozen reporters up my ass.

134
00:15:21,674 --> 00:15:24,759
They've been asking me
about Snowflake all morning.

135
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,004
Who's he?

136
00:15:29,266 --> 00:15:31,674
Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.

137
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,769
He's our pet detective.

138
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:38,858
Nice to meet you. You came very
highly recommended by Martha Mertz.

139
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:40,486
Martha Mertz?

140
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,316
Oh, yeah, the bitch!

141
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:49,245
Pekingese, lost in Highland Park area.
She was half-dead when I found her.

142
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,826
Is that the tank?

143
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,870
Excuse me.

144
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:05,296
- Cops drain it?
- Yes, this morning.

145
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,350
If I'm not back in five minutes...

146
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:11,063
...just wait longer.

147
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,162
Captain's log, stardate 23.9, rounded
off to the nearest decimal point.

148
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:37,590
We've traveled back in time to save
an ancient species from annihilation.

149
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:38,962
So far...

150
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:43,475
...no signs of aquatic life,
but I am going to find it.

151
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:46,936
If I have to tear another black hole,
I'm going to find it!

152
00:16:47,148 --> 00:16:50,731
I've got to, mister!

153
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,118
Oh, great!

154
00:17:04,794 --> 00:17:06,336
I'll try to head them off.

155
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,545
Ace, get out of the tank.

156
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:10,417
I just can't do it, captain!

157
00:17:10,676 --> 00:17:12,585
I don't have the power!

158
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:16,344
People!

159
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:18,925
I said, get out of the tank now!

160
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:22,809
For God's sake, Jim,
I'm a doctor, not a pool man!

161
00:17:23,065 --> 00:17:24,476
Where's Snowflake?

162
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,693
Snowflake is not available right now.

163
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:32,365
Roger, I've been waiting all day.
I got to get a shot of his new trick!

164
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,112
What, is he sick?

165
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:52,217
People, people!

166
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:30,301
Lassie must be missing.

167
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:36,566
Make any good collars lately?

168
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:38,526
Or were they leashes?

169
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:49,908
Homicide, Ventura.

170
00:18:51,251 --> 00:18:53,493
How are you gonna solve that one?

171
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,881
Good question, Aguado!

172
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:00,546
First, I'd establish a motive.

173
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:05,513
The killer saw the size of the bug's
dick and became insanely jealous.

174
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:12,561
Then I'd lose 30 pounds
porking his wife!

175
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,022
Come on!

176
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,984
Now, kiss and make up!

177
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,570
Excuse me.

178
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:27,323
I'd like to ass you a few questions.

179
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,376
This is not the time, Ace.

180
00:19:29,629 --> 00:19:34,208
If Einhorn come down here and see me
talking to you or your ass, I'm history.

181
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:39,595
I can keep him under control. You have
to tell me who's on the Snowflake case.

182
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:43,265
I can't do nothing for you on that.
My hands are tied.

183
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,854
All right, that's it!
Now it's my turn!

184
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:49,515
Five minutes alone, that's all I need!

185
00:19:49,777 --> 00:19:52,529
Better look alive.
Einhorn's on her way down.

186
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,282
Come on, now. Ace, please.

187
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:59,663
What's that matter?
Afraid I'll make a stink? Come on!

188
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:02,121
Aguado's working the case, all right?

189
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:03,573
Aguado!

190
00:20:04,795 --> 00:20:06,040
Good call!

191
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,378
We're just a little busy now...

192
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:12,459
...with murderers and burglaries
and drug dealers. Things like that.

193
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:15,675
A missing dolphin isn't exactly
a high priority.

194
00:20:19,562 --> 00:20:21,270
Now you've pissed him off.

195
00:20:22,565 --> 00:20:25,686
- Would you give me a break?
- I can't hold him much longer!

196
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:26,940
My boss is coming!

197
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:30,072
Okay, look.

198
00:20:30,408 --> 00:20:33,030
We ran a check with local
animal-rights groups.

199
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:37,415
We checked out the taxidermists
and we already checked on van rentals.

200
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:40,870
So far, nothing, nathin', <i>nada.</i>
All right?

201
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:43,374
Any unusual bets being made?

202
00:20:43,632 --> 00:20:45,624
Of course! This is Super Bowl!

203
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:48,464
- What'd you find out about the tank?
- Nothing.

204
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,930
Tire tracks, an escape route.
A guard didn't see anything.

205
00:20:53,101 --> 00:20:54,679
- That's it?
- I swear.

206
00:20:54,895 --> 00:20:58,145
Now will you please get out of here
before I get in trouble?

207
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:03,313
Thank you for your cooperation.

208
00:21:03,905 --> 00:21:06,527
By the way, do you have a mint?

209
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:08,985
Perhaps some Binaca?

210
00:21:21,342 --> 00:21:23,916
<i>Assholomio</i>

211
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:27,011
<i>Osadomia</i>

212
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:33,597
Holy testicle Tuesday!

213
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,937
What the hell is he doing here?

214
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:38,772
I came to confess.

215
00:21:39,363 --> 00:21:42,530
I was the second gunman
on the grassy knoll.

216
00:21:43,326 --> 00:21:47,704
Spare me the routine. I know
you're working the Snowflake case.

217
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,872
May I suggest you yield
to the experts on this one?

218
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,328
We'll find the porpoise.

219
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:58,801
Now I feel better.

220
00:21:59,762 --> 00:22:03,178
Of course, that might not do any good.

221
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:06,926
Nobody's missing a porpoise.
It's a dolphin that's been taken.

222
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:09,857
The common harbor
porpoise has an abrupt snout...

223
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:14,146
...while the bottle-nosed dolphin,
or Tursiops truncatus...

224
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:18,859
...has an elongated beak, cone-shaped
teeth and a serrated dorsal appendage.

225
00:22:19,118 --> 00:22:21,823
But I'm sure you already knew that.

226
00:22:22,163 --> 00:22:24,405
That's what turns me on about you.

227
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,244
Your attention to detail.

228
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:28,829
Listen, pet dick...

229
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:33,040
...how would you like me
to make your life a living hell?

230
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:37,385
Well, I'm not really ready
for a relationship, Lois.

231
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:39,590
But thank you for asking.

232
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:46,140
Maybe I'll give you a call sometime.

233
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,733
Your number still 911?

234
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:49,812
Alrighty, then!

235
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,274
Excuse me. Is Greg here?

236
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:33,484
Thank you!

237
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:56,180
What's the password?

238
00:23:56,439 --> 00:23:59,013
New England clam chowder.

239
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:02,196
Is that the red or the white?

240
00:24:03,531 --> 00:24:05,358
I can never remember that!

241
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:07,530
White?

242
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:12,662
Hey, Woodstock!

243
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:15,117
Hey, Saint Francis, how's it going?

244
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:18,830
Super, thanks for asking.
I hope you're having a lovely day.

245
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,086
Do you?

246
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:21,540
Don't I?

247
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:24,551
So what are you up to?

248
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:27,344
Just watching the fishies.

249
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:30,762
You see those blips?
That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.

250
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,849
I'm sending them new
directional coordinates.

251
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:37,311
They'll find Jimmy Hoffa...

252
00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:39,356
...before they find any whales.

253
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:44,194
Gravy! So can you still tap into
the aquatic supply stores in the area?

254
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:45,782
Of course I can. Why?

255
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:48,197
I wanna trace the sale of equipment...

256
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,376
...for transporting or housing
a dolphin recently.

257
00:24:51,628 --> 00:24:54,713
Come on, I thought you had
a challenge for me.

258
00:24:55,007 --> 00:24:59,717
All right, we got marine winch, sling,
feeder fish, 20,000-gallon tank...

259
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,006
Wait a minute. Look here.

260
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:07,137
That's a lot of equipment
for a civilian.

261
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,272
Ronald Camp? The billionaire?

262
00:25:09,524 --> 00:25:11,932
Billionaire and rare-fish collector.

263
00:25:12,194 --> 00:25:15,978
Really?

264
00:25:16,574 --> 00:25:18,234
That is the face of the enemy.

265
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:22,238
Always trying to get his greedy hands
on endangered species.

266
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:23,994
Hold on.

267
00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:26,082
Camp is connected with the dolphins?

268
00:25:26,335 --> 00:25:29,954
That subgenius gave them the land
the stadium's built on.

269
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:35,376
And look, he's throwing another "I'm
the richest man in the universe" party.

270
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:41,390
Looks like it's time for me
to get myself a date.

271
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:52,027
I'm really going out on a limb here.
His social events are strictly A-list.

272
00:25:52,324 --> 00:25:57,283
The date started good, Chuck, but before
we got to the party, she tensed up.

273
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,037
If you do anything to embarrass me...

274
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:02,166
What? Like this?

275
00:26:08,593 --> 00:26:10,218
Hi, Captain Stubing.

276
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,048
How are Gopher and Doc?

277
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:14,757
Permission to come aboard, sir.

278
00:26:34,373 --> 00:26:35,915
I'm sorry, ladies.

279
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:40,706
Glad you could make it.

280
00:26:41,005 --> 00:26:42,464
Thank you.

281
00:26:43,884 --> 00:26:45,082
You look wonderful.

282
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:49,054
And who is he, a friend?

283
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,228
No, this is...
This is my date.

284
00:26:55,022 --> 00:26:56,813
He's a lawyer.

285
00:26:57,066 --> 00:27:00,186
Does he have a name,
or should I call him "Lawyer"?

286
00:27:04,032 --> 00:27:06,109
I'm sorry. This is Ace V...

287
00:27:07,578 --> 00:27:09,072
Tom Ace.

288
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,492
Pleasure to meet you.

289
00:27:11,708 --> 00:27:13,701
Congratulations on all your success.

290
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,455
You smell terrific!

291
00:27:16,088 --> 00:27:18,626
One of the first lessons we learned...

292
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:19,956
...back at...

293
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:25,343
...Stanford was the growth of food-
poisoning claims against wealthy-people.

294
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:28,927
One could make quite
a lucrative law practice...

295
00:27:29,145 --> 00:27:30,390
...with little else.

296
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,684
How is everybody feeling tonight?

297
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:37,478
Very, very well, thank you.

298
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,568
Look, honey...

299
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,568
...there's the hors d'oeuvres.

300
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,453
Are you insane? There is no way
that Camp stole Snowflake.

301
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:55,046
What are you trying to do?

302
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:02,806
Will you keep him occupied
while I work my magic, please?

303
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:10,316
Smooshy, isn't it?

304
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:22,997
We got a few cases
from my new dealer in Paris.

305
00:28:24,084 --> 00:28:25,578
Excuse me, Ron...

306
00:28:25,836 --> 00:28:27,829
...I need to use the bathroom.

307
00:28:28,088 --> 00:28:30,295
I think it's the pâté.

308
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,258
Sure, it's over there.

309
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,180
Stuff probably looks better
on the way out.

310
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,146
He wasn't feeling well earlier today.

311
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:26,506
Gravy!

312
00:30:30,147 --> 00:30:31,807
Don't worry, Snowflake.

313
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,774
Ace Ventura's here.

314
00:30:37,113 --> 00:30:38,394
Yummy!

315
00:30:57,637 --> 00:30:58,918
Snowflake!

316
00:31:00,516 --> 00:31:02,093
Here, Snowflake.

317
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:05,429
I've got a snack for you.

318
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,657
They're wonderful, aren't they?

319
00:31:22,374 --> 00:31:24,367
Yes, they certainly are.

320
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:27,418
No matter what's going on in my life...

321
00:31:27,672 --> 00:31:29,712
...I can always watch them swim...

322
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,376
...and be totally at peace.

323
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,389
It's not Snowflake!

324
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:43,856
It's not Snowflake!

325
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:48,029
It's not Snowflake!

326
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,919
Are you sure your date is all right?

327
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,053
It's been an awfully long time.

328
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:12,635
Who, Tom?

329
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,134
Well, I'm sure he's fine.

330
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:27,858
Do not go in there!

331
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:45,418
I'm sorry. I'll have the plumbing
checked immediately.

332
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,760
Do that! If I'd been drinking out
of the toilet, I might've been killed.

333
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:52,141
I'm sorry again, Mr. Ace.

334
00:32:57,986 --> 00:32:59,445
What're you doing?

335
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:01,190
I'm sorry, Ron.

336
00:33:01,448 --> 00:33:02,777
What's he doing?

337
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,409
Let's go!

338
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,289
Stop it!

339
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,537
I don't even wanna know
why your pants are missing!

340
00:33:13,796 --> 00:33:15,587
You could've cost me my job!

341
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:19,882
So you found a pebble
in Snowflake's tank. I'll call CNN.

342
00:33:20,136 --> 00:33:22,295
I found it in the filter, thank you.

343
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:27,017
And it's not a pebble, it's a rare,
triangular cut orange amber.

344
00:33:28,688 --> 00:33:30,396
What're you talking about?

345
00:33:30,649 --> 00:33:33,852
Tonight I saw the same stone
in Camp's ring.

346
00:33:34,153 --> 00:33:36,229
I thought you said Camp didn't do it.

347
00:33:36,489 --> 00:33:38,897
No, his ring wasn't missing a stone.

348
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,118
But whoever was in that tank
had a ring just like his.

349
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:44,203
Ring? What ring?

350
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:50,210
The 1984 Dolphin AFC championship ring.

351
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:55,922
I find the ring with a missing stone,
I find Snowflake.

352
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:58,840
How you gonna do that?

353
00:34:00,892 --> 00:34:02,221
Simple.

354
00:34:09,611 --> 00:34:10,441
Loser!

355
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:12,896
Why don't you learn how to drive, pal?

356
00:34:14,908 --> 00:34:16,189
You wanna play?

357
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,410
Damn it!

358
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:52,958
That stone could've come from anywhere.

359
00:36:53,217 --> 00:36:54,878
It could've come from...

360
00:36:55,136 --> 00:36:58,091
...a necklace or a pendant, an earring.

361
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,638
It came from an '84 AFC
championship ring.

362
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:11,610
Einhorn thinks it may have been
an animal-rights group. You know FAN?

363
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:17,027
Free Animals Now, started by Chelsea,
daughter of industrialist Fisher Gamble?

364
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,285
Over half a million members worldwide?

365
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,408
No. Who are they?

366
00:37:22,293 --> 00:37:23,324
Did you know...

367
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:27,881
...they sent letters to college teams
demanding the release of their mascots?

368
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:29,634
What do you feed your dog?

369
00:37:31,387 --> 00:37:33,427
Dog food. Why?

370
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,098
He is miserable!

371
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:37,053
What are you talking about?

372
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:41,267
He's very unhappy. I feel sorry for him.
Bad diet, isolated environment.

373
00:37:41,524 --> 00:37:43,600
It's amazing he's still alive.

374
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:49,858
You're just mad because your stupid
pebble theory didn't work out.

375
00:37:50,075 --> 00:37:51,486
You can't express anger.

376
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:54,321
Yeah? And you're ugly.

377
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,209
I'm not even gonna talk to you.
Would you please leave?

378
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:01,294
Why? So you can beat him?

379
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,578
Fatty!

380
00:38:03,424 --> 00:38:04,800
You're unbelievable!

381
00:38:05,051 --> 00:38:07,293
Hiring you was the biggest mistake
I ever made.

382
00:38:07,512 --> 00:38:10,383
Well, why don't you cry about it,
saddlebags?

383
00:38:15,355 --> 00:38:16,897
You like her, huh?

384
00:38:17,732 --> 00:38:19,441
Yeah, she's all right.

385
00:38:28,996 --> 00:38:31,072
Look, Melissa, I...

386
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,964
I'm here at the North Beach Towers
condo complex in north Miami...

387
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:42,881
...where Roger Podacter, head of
operations for the Miami Dolphins...

388
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:45,213
...has apparently committed suicide...

389
00:38:45,473 --> 00:38:49,258
...allegedly leaping to his death
from his 20th-story balcony...

390
00:38:58,321 --> 00:38:59,780
You okay?

391
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:02,613
I told you. I was in my apartment...

392
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,025
...across the hall.

393
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,412
I heard a scream...

394
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:08,622
...so I called the manager.

395
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,537
The place was empty, except for the dog.

396
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:15,293
I opened the balcony door
and looked out...

397
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:17,667
...splat, bang, pancake time.

398
00:39:17,927 --> 00:39:20,004
Okay, thank you very much.

399
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:26,687
Hi there, fella.

400
00:39:26,938 --> 00:39:28,349
Have a bad night?

401
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,407
So...

402
00:39:40,787 --> 00:39:42,864
...animals can sense evil.

403
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:44,951
Who let Dr. Doolittle in?

404
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,701
Lieutenant, he came with Miss Robinson.

405
00:39:47,962 --> 00:39:52,839
This is police business. We'll let you
know if the coroner finds a tick.

406
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:56,587
Face it...

407
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:58,882
Forget it. She's right.

408
00:39:59,142 --> 00:40:00,138
Besides...

409
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:04,890
...I wouldn't want someone tracing
my steps, pointing out my mistakes.

410
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:20,744
So...

411
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,785
...you don't think this is an obvious
suicide, Mr. Pet Detective?

412
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:29,675
I wouldn't say that. There's plenty
of evidence here to support your theory.

413
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,214
Except, of course, for that
spot of blood on the railing.

414
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:40,346
May I tell you what I think happened?

415
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:41,982
Alrighty, then!

416
00:40:42,192 --> 00:40:45,858
Roger Podacter went out after work,
had a few drinks, then came home.

417
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:49,898
He wasn't alone. Someone else
was with him. There was a struggle...

418
00:40:50,118 --> 00:40:52,692
...and he was thrown over that balcony.

419
00:40:52,913 --> 00:40:55,404
Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide.

420
00:40:55,791 --> 00:40:57,416
He was murdered.

421
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,459
That's a very entertaining story...

422
00:41:01,715 --> 00:41:05,927
...but real detectives have to worry
about that little thing called...

423
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,714
...evidence.

424
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:12,134
I think I heard a toilet flush.

425
00:41:12,394 --> 00:41:14,683
Maybe somebody lost a turtle.

426
00:41:18,276 --> 00:41:19,818
Well, I...

427
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,771
I guess I'm out of my league here.

428
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,486
Good work.

429
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:37,745
There is just
one more thing, lieutenant.

430
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:41,504
This woman is Roger Podacter's neighbor.

431
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:44,050
She said she heard a scream. Right?

432
00:41:44,264 --> 00:41:47,266
And you had to open
the balcony door when you came in?

433
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:51,018
- That's true.
- You're sure you had to open this door?

434
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,268
I'm certain.

435
00:41:52,524 --> 00:41:54,517
What's the point, Ventura?

436
00:41:55,235 --> 00:41:57,145
Only this.

437
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:13,247
This is double-paned, soundproof glass.
There is no way...

438
00:42:13,507 --> 00:42:17,090
...she could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down.

439
00:42:17,344 --> 00:42:19,670
The scream she heard
came from inside...

440
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:24,807
...before he was thrown off the balcony.
The murderer closed the door upon going.

441
00:42:27,898 --> 00:42:29,975
Can you feel that, buddy?

442
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:36,318
I have exorcized the demons!

443
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:41,032
This house is clear.

444
00:42:42,457 --> 00:42:44,082
- Losers.
- Get him out of here!

445
00:42:44,668 --> 00:42:47,835
- Losers! Losers!
- Let's go, Ace.

446
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:49,746
Losers.

447
00:42:52,343 --> 00:42:53,339
Come on.

448
00:42:53,553 --> 00:42:55,345
Back to the zoo.

449
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:00,095
What are you thinking?

450
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:03,184
This whole thing is connected, somehow.

451
00:43:03,899 --> 00:43:06,307
I want to find that other ring.

452
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:10,396
Ace, you checked all the rings.

453
00:43:10,656 --> 00:43:12,815
Receipts? What about receipts?

454
00:43:13,076 --> 00:43:14,736
There's gotta be receipts.

455
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,208
That was pretty impressive,
what you did at the apartment.

456
00:43:27,968 --> 00:43:29,628
You don't have to tell me.

457
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:31,638
I was there.

458
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:37,593
Maybe you should've joined the police
force, become a real detective.

459
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,764
I don't do humans.

460
00:43:42,068 --> 00:43:43,693
You really love animals.

461
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,197
If it gets cold enough.

462
00:43:49,118 --> 00:43:51,740
No, I have a kinship with them.

463
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,491
I understand them.

464
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,410
Wanna hear something spooky?

465
00:43:57,628 --> 00:43:58,873
Sure.

466
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:05,921
One time when I was about 12, I had
a dream that I was being followed by...

467
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,971
...a big dog with rabies.

468
00:44:08,223 --> 00:44:10,133
He had these bloodshot eyes...

469
00:44:10,351 --> 00:44:12,178
...and foam came out of his mouth.

470
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:17,515
No matter how fast I ran, he just kept
gaining on me and gaining on me.

471
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,614
Then just before I got
to my front door...

472
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:25,440
...he jumped and sank his teeth in.

473
00:44:27,496 --> 00:44:29,370
That's when I woke up...

474
00:44:29,623 --> 00:44:32,708
...and felt the back of my neck.
Check that out.

475
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,293
Bastard!

476
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,304
I'm sorry, I just couldn't help myself.

477
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,881
Want to know why I do this?

478
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,842
I'm not sure anymore.

479
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,553
You better be sure...

480
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,761
...because once you get
inside my head...

481
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:52,725
...there's no turning back.

482
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:05,326
So...

483
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:09,541
Are these all? There's only a dozen.

484
00:45:09,795 --> 00:45:11,871
Maybe it's in another file,
in the back.

485
00:45:12,131 --> 00:45:13,756
Who the hell is that?

486
00:45:14,175 --> 00:45:15,420
What?

487
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:20,754
That.

488
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:23,343
Who the hell is that?

489
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,436
That's Ray Finkle, the kicker.
Don't you know who he is?

490
00:45:29,234 --> 00:45:30,978
Why isn't he in this picture?

491
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:40,278
This was taken earlier in the year.
Ray Finkle wasn't added till mid-season.

492
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,253
He missed the final field goal
in the Super Bowl that year.

493
00:45:49,508 --> 00:45:51,133
Cost the Dolphins the game.

494
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:53,794
But he got himself a ring, didn't he?

495
00:45:55,098 --> 00:45:56,343
Definitely.

496
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:59,429
"Replacement kicker
having a great year."

497
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:02,392
"Ready for Super Bowl,
all-star kicker boasts."

498
00:46:02,606 --> 00:46:05,976
"Field goal sails wide,
Dolphins lose Super Bowl."

499
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:09,066
"The kick heard round the world."

500
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:12,692
That was Finkle.
The Dolphins lost by one point.

501
00:46:13,953 --> 00:46:16,623
Poor guy.

502
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,120
Poor guy with a motive, baby.

503
00:46:19,501 --> 00:46:21,043
Where is he now?

504
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,499
I heard he went back
to his hometown in Collier County.

505
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:29,002
Really?

506
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:33,340
You're gonna drop me off before you go?

507
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:36,973
No way. You shouldn't be
left alone right now.

508
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,804
It might not be safe at your apartment.

509
00:46:40,525 --> 00:46:42,353
What do you suggest?

510
00:47:26,788 --> 00:47:28,330
Oh, my God!

511
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:30,874
Oh, my God.

512
00:47:32,336 --> 00:47:34,163
Three times?

513
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:37,460
I'm sorry, that's never
happened to me before.

514
00:47:38,259 --> 00:47:40,003
I must be tired.

515
00:47:43,515 --> 00:47:45,259
Okay, I'm ready again.

516
00:48:37,411 --> 00:48:39,321
I'm looking for Ray Finkle...

517
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:42,372
...and a clean pair of shorts.

518
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:45,502
What do you know about Ray Finkle?

519
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:50,710
Soccer-style kicker.
Graduated from Collier High, 1976.

520
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,718
Stetson University honors graduate,
1980. Holds two NCAA records.

521
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:56,551
Most points and distance.

522
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,638
Nickname, "The Mule."
The only pro athlete from here.

523
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,725
And one hell of a model American.

524
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,283
Are you another one of them
<i>Hard Copy</i> guys?

525
00:49:11,534 --> 00:49:12,566
No, sir.

526
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:14,280
I'm just a big Finkle fan.

527
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,282
This is my Graceland, sir.

528
00:49:19,127 --> 00:49:21,203
Will you put that gun down?

529
00:49:21,796 --> 00:49:24,833
The boy is a fan of our son.

530
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:27,795
So nice to meet you.

531
00:49:28,054 --> 00:49:29,513
I'm Ray's mother...

532
00:49:29,764 --> 00:49:31,472
...and this is Ray's father.

533
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:34,011
It's a real honor!

534
00:49:34,645 --> 00:49:37,599
It's an honor to have you here.

535
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:42,193
My Ray is so appreciative of his fans.

536
00:49:42,445 --> 00:49:44,937
He'll be so pleased you stopped by.

537
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,357
Are you expecting Ray anytime soon?

538
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:50,240
Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute.

539
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:54,206
Would you like some cookies?
I just baked them.

540
00:49:54,501 --> 00:49:56,126
Yummy!

541
00:50:02,427 --> 00:50:04,586
Ray Finkle's house.

542
00:50:05,931 --> 00:50:07,556
I can't wait to meet him.

543
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:12,428
Ray ain't coming home.

544
00:50:14,191 --> 00:50:16,314
But your wife expects him any minute.

545
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:19,196
She expects him home any minute.

546
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,024
See, the engine's running
but there's nobody behind the wheel.

547
00:50:25,537 --> 00:50:26,652
Eight years ago...

548
00:50:26,914 --> 00:50:30,995
...our son escaped from
Shady Acres Mental Hospital.

549
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,081
And they're still bugging us
to pick up his stuff.

550
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:37,958
It was all that Dan Marino's fault.
Everyone knows that.

551
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:41,506
If he'd held the ball laces out,
like he's supposed to...

552
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:44,137
...Ray wouldn't have missed the kick.

553
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:48,688
Dan Marino should die
of gonorrhea and rot in hell.

554
00:50:48,939 --> 00:50:50,932
Would you like a cookie, son?

555
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:55,148
What do you know?

556
00:50:55,697 --> 00:50:57,571
They're little footballs.

557
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:59,159
Laces out.

558
00:51:00,703 --> 00:51:03,539
When Ray gets back and starts
kicking again...

559
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:06,116
...he'll never even know he was gone.

560
00:51:06,376 --> 00:51:09,247
I've kept his room
just the way he left it.

561
00:51:31,781 --> 00:51:33,110
Oh, boy!

562
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,156
What a sports nut, huh?

563
00:51:47,966 --> 00:51:48,915
May I?

564
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:51,216
Oh, yes, by all means.

565
00:51:54,766 --> 00:51:58,052
<i>Five seconds to go here</i>
<i>in Super Bowl 17.</i>

566
00:51:58,312 --> 00:52:00,103
<i>Dolphins trailing the 49ers...</i>

567
00:52:00,314 --> 00:52:04,099
<i>... by one. This will</i>
<i>win the game for Miami.</i>

568
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,021
<i>There's the snap.</i>

569
00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:07,478
<i>Marino holds.</i>

570
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:08,902
<i>The kick...</i>

571
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,609
<i>... and it's high. No, it's...</i>

572
00:52:11,827 --> 00:52:12,741
<i>... no good.</i>

573
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:16,910
<i>Ray Finkle blew a 26-yard field goal!</i>

574
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,041
<i>I don't believe it!</i>

575
00:52:19,253 --> 00:52:20,996
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>

576
00:52:21,213 --> 00:52:25,426
<i>The Dolphins lose!</i>
<i>The Dolphins lose the Super Bowl!</i>

577
00:52:27,053 --> 00:52:29,462
- Melissa, it's Ace!
<i>- Where are you?</i>

578
00:52:29,723 --> 00:52:33,307
I'm in psychoville, and Finkle's
the mayor. Where's Marino?

579
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,724
Why?

580
00:52:34,938 --> 00:52:38,105
He's about to join Snowflake.
I've gotta know where he is!

581
00:52:38,317 --> 00:52:42,564
He has a commercial shoot
at the Bogart Sound Stage.

582
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:45,865
Call the police. Get extra
security over there. Now!

583
00:52:46,117 --> 00:52:48,075
Ace, what's going on?

584
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:52,286
Thought I left?

585
00:52:54,335 --> 00:52:56,127
I'm really gonna go this time.

586
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,964
Here we go, folks. Very quiet.

587
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,091
Action!

588
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:12,397
I'm Dan Marino, and if anyone knows
the value of protection, it's me.

589
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:21,692
So I take care of the hands
that take care of me...

590
00:53:22,368 --> 00:53:23,648
...with Isotoner gloves!

591
00:53:23,911 --> 00:53:25,821
Cut! Again from the top.

592
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,118
I said, cut!

593
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:28,654
Guys, it's a cut!

594
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:31,248
What the hell are they doing?

595
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:33,128
That's a cut!

596
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,758
- What is this, a rewrite?
- Shut up!

597
00:53:45,103 --> 00:53:46,645
- Where'd they go?
- Over there!

598
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:47,892
Let's go!

599
00:53:54,989 --> 00:53:56,567
Excuse me, gentlemen!

600
00:53:56,825 --> 00:53:57,939
Pet detective!

601
00:54:06,628 --> 00:54:07,624
Come on!

602
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:09,118
What's wrong?

603
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:10,834
Can't you hit me?

604
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,247
Have there been ransom demands?

605
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,956
There's no communication
with the kidnappers.

606
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,128
Will the Super Bowl be postponed?

607
00:54:45,381 --> 00:54:46,875
The game is on as scheduled.

608
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,043
Why weren't we told
about the kidnapping?

609
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:52,297
Secrecy was essential.
We couldn't risk any interference.

610
00:54:52,514 --> 00:54:56,513
- Are the crimes related?
- I'm sorry, I can't comment further.

611
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:58,679
Now, if you'll excuse me...

612
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,933
Get me the autopsy on Podacter!

613
00:55:03,193 --> 00:55:06,029
Aguado, send out a memo:
No one talks to the press!

614
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,854
And somebody get me some coffee!

615
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:12,985
Tonight on <i>Miami Vice,</i>
Crockett gets the boss a coffee!

616
00:55:14,498 --> 00:55:18,449
When I get out of that bathroom,
you'd better be gone!

617
00:55:19,087 --> 00:55:21,127
Is it number one or number two?

618
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:23,630
I just wanna know how much time I have.

619
00:55:25,678 --> 00:55:28,679
By the way,
I went ahead and solved that...

620
00:55:28,932 --> 00:55:31,886
...pesky Snowflake-Podacter-
Marino thing.

621
00:55:32,603 --> 00:55:36,268
You ever heard of a former
Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle?

622
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,907
All right, Ventura...

623
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,358
...make it quick.

624
00:55:47,745 --> 00:55:50,866
I found a rare stone
at the bottom of Snowflake's tank.

625
00:55:51,124 --> 00:55:53,794
It belongs to a Dolphin '84 AFC
championship ring.

626
00:55:54,044 --> 00:55:57,165
It would've been a Super Bowl ring,
but Ray missed the kick.

627
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:59,374
Blames the whole thing on Marino.

628
00:55:59,634 --> 00:56:04,261
We're talking paranoid, delusional
psychosis. I saw the guy's room.

629
00:56:04,473 --> 00:56:06,715
Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lecter.

630
00:56:07,602 --> 00:56:09,891
So how does Roger Podacter fit in?

631
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:15,101
My guess is, Finkle was snooping around.
Podacter recognized him. End of story.

632
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:19,982
As for Snowflake, they gave him Finkle's
number, taught him how to kick a goal.

633
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,027
Finkle took it personally.

634
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:26,163
So where is Finkle now?

635
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:30,835
Busted out of a mental institute. He's
been plotting his revenge for years.

636
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,757
Waiting for the perfect time
to get back at them.

637
00:56:33,966 --> 00:56:35,840
The time when it'd hurt them most:

638
00:56:36,051 --> 00:56:38,210
Super Bowl time.

639
00:56:38,471 --> 00:56:40,843
Man, I'm tired of being right!

640
00:56:45,229 --> 00:56:46,854
Congratulations.

641
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:50,901
You've done some fine detective work...

642
00:56:52,779 --> 00:56:53,977
...Ace.

643
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:58,279
I'm sorry, could you
speak into my good ear?

644
00:56:58,536 --> 00:57:00,659
I thought I heard you call me Ace.

645
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:05,833
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you are more than just a pet dick.

646
00:57:14,054 --> 00:57:16,676
Your gun is digging into my hip.

647
00:57:16,932 --> 00:57:18,391
What's wrong?

648
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,099
Want me to read you your rights?

649
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,688
Maybe later.

650
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,975
What is it?

651
00:57:28,237 --> 00:57:29,815
That bony little bitch...

652
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,781
...Melissa Robinson?

653
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:34,568
You just don't do anything for me.

654
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:37,283
Down, boy!

655
00:57:39,375 --> 00:57:42,080
Everything okay in here?
I heard some commotion.

656
00:57:42,545 --> 00:57:44,123
Fine, sergeant.

657
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,250
You want me to throw him out?

658
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:49,584
Why don't you throw yourself out?

659
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:52,878
Yes, ma'am.

660
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:59,016
Ace, I want you to leave
everything to us.

661
00:57:59,273 --> 00:58:02,524
I can't do that, lieutenant.
I was hired to find Snowflake.

662
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:04,438
When we find Marino...

663
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:06,736
...we'll deliver Snowflake.

664
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,067
When I find Snowflake...

665
00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:12,286
...I'll deliver Marino.

666
00:58:24,427 --> 00:58:25,626
Melissa, it's Ace!

667
00:58:25,887 --> 00:58:28,759
What are you doing here?
It's the middle of the night.

668
00:58:29,517 --> 00:58:31,510
You have to commit me.

669
00:58:32,687 --> 00:58:36,139
Finkle escaped from Shady Acres.
They still have his stuff.

670
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,642
They aren't gonna let us look around.

671
00:58:38,903 --> 00:58:39,982
I know.

672
00:58:40,237 --> 00:58:43,073
It's a good thing
I'm a master of disguise.

673
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:44,356
Mrs. Robinson...

674
00:58:44,701 --> 00:58:46,741
...I'm Dr. Handly.

675
00:58:46,995 --> 00:58:49,403
Now who is it you want us to look at?

676
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:50,910
My brother...

677
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:52,741
...Larry.

678
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:59,462
I'm ready to go in.
Just give me a chance!

679
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:02,631
I know there's a lot riding on it,
but it's all psychological.

680
00:59:02,931 --> 00:59:04,639
Just gotta stay positive.

681
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,977
I'm gonna execute
a buttonhook pattern, super slow-mo.

682
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:39,294
Let's see that...

683
00:59:39,556 --> 00:59:41,181
...in an instant replay.

684
00:59:56,535 --> 00:59:59,821
Your brother won't be
the first football pro we've treated.

685
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,786
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're very sensitive...

686
01:00:03,042 --> 01:00:05,498
...to the stress athletes
have to endure.

687
01:00:05,754 --> 01:00:07,711
I'm open! I'm open!

688
01:00:08,549 --> 01:00:10,257
I'm open!

689
01:00:11,093 --> 01:00:13,585
We'll do some preliminary evaluations...

690
01:00:13,846 --> 01:00:16,005
...but I think he'll fit in nicely here.

691
01:00:16,266 --> 01:00:17,844
Over here!

692
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:21,770
351!

693
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:24,023
351!

694
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:26,233
Rover, sit! Hut, hut!

695
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:32,444
He seems to have some difficulty
letting go of the game.

696
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:35,028
Has he had a history of mental illness?

697
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,289
As long as I've known him.

698
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:42,832
This is one of our therapy rooms.

699
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:47,131
And we do arts and crafts
out here in the courtyard.

700
01:00:47,385 --> 01:00:51,300
And this is the storage room.
Down the hallway we have another...

701
01:00:51,557 --> 01:00:53,051
Halftime!

702
01:01:07,033 --> 01:01:10,948
He'll be fine there by himself
for the next 20 minutes.

703
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,865
I'll show you the dormitories, then.

704
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:28,376
Isotoners.

705
01:02:47,775 --> 01:02:50,101
Obsess much?

706
01:02:51,738 --> 01:02:53,363
Where are you going?

707
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:56,617
- To clean the storage room.
- No, clean the cafeteria.

708
01:02:56,828 --> 01:02:58,904
I don't tell you how to do your job.

709
01:02:59,164 --> 01:03:00,788
The schedule says...

710
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:03,449
...clean the cafeteria.
- I know what I'm doing.

711
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:04,956
You should've done it earlier.

712
01:03:05,212 --> 01:03:08,463
Man, come on. Cafeteria, my ass!
I'm cleaning in here!

713
01:03:08,675 --> 01:03:10,751
You take breaks too long. You smoke...

714
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:13,253
Man, you're a pain in the ass!

715
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:38,531
"Search called off for missing hiker."

716
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,702
"A search ended today
when rescue workers...

717
01:03:41,963 --> 01:03:45,547
...were unable to find the body
of Lois Einhorn."

718
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:49,337
A hiker missing since Friday?

719
01:03:49,597 --> 01:03:51,175
Lois Einhorn?

720
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,181
Holy shitballs!

721
01:04:08,995 --> 01:04:11,747
What're you doing out here?
Get back to work!

722
01:04:40,907 --> 01:04:42,188
"Love, Roger"?

723
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:51,997
<i>Ace, it's E.</i>

724
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:55,332
<i>You think the article you found</i>
<i>was something?</i>

725
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,082
<i>I got a note from Roger to Einhorn...</i>

726
01:04:58,344 --> 01:05:00,670
<i>... thanking her for a wonderful evening.</i>

727
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,504
<i>Something ain't stirring</i>
<i>the Kool-Aid, man.</i>

728
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,641
Wiggles, rewind.

729
01:05:09,816 --> 01:05:13,185
What the hell does Lois Einhorn
have to do with Ray Finkle?

730
01:05:14,988 --> 01:05:16,566
Come on, think!

731
01:05:16,782 --> 01:05:19,949
Finkle and Einhorn, in it together.
How? Why?

732
01:05:27,086 --> 01:05:28,628
All right! Here we go.

733
01:05:28,879 --> 01:05:32,083
Answer's right there!
Just gotta get blood to the brain!

734
01:05:32,675 --> 01:05:35,345
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

735
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:37,926
Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn!

736
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:53,402
Quitter!

737
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:57,487
What do you want?

738
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,578
I don't have any food for you.

739
01:06:02,043 --> 01:06:04,713
I have to have money to buy food.

740
01:06:04,963 --> 01:06:08,333
I have to have a dolphin to get money.
Do you see a dolphin here?

741
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:18,055
Let's face it...

742
01:06:18,312 --> 01:06:20,352
...your master is a loser.

743
01:06:37,459 --> 01:06:39,417
What the?

744
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,290
That's it.

745
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,011
That's it!

746
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:49,795
Einhorn is Finkle.

747
01:06:50,057 --> 01:06:52,430
Finkle is Einhorn!

748
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:55,099
Einhorn is a man!

749
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,599
Oh, my God!

750
01:06:59,026 --> 01:07:01,600
Einhorn is a man!

751
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:00,592
"Your gun is digging into my hip."

752
01:08:01,557 --> 01:08:02,933
God!

753
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:09,098
<i>And the big story in this</i>
<i>Super Bowl game is the abduction...</i>

754
01:08:09,316 --> 01:08:12,401
<i>... of Miami's starting quarterback,</i>
<i>Dan Marino.</i>

755
01:08:12,653 --> 01:08:15,773
<i>It's gotta be a strain</i>
<i>on this Miami team, Bob...</i>

756
01:08:54,118 --> 01:08:57,618
What's the matter, Dan?
Aren't you having fun?

757
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:01,663
I just love Super Bowl Sunday.
Don't you, Dan?

758
01:09:01,919 --> 01:09:04,208
A magical afternoon...

759
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:06,831
...where dreams are made...

760
01:09:07,926 --> 01:09:09,420
...and crushed.

761
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:13,261
Look, if you want tickets,
you're going about it the wrong way.

762
01:09:14,809 --> 01:09:18,392
Do I look familiar to you?
Does it seem as if we've...

763
01:09:18,605 --> 01:09:20,764
...met someplace before?

764
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:23,765
I don't know.
I get hit in the head a lot.

765
01:09:24,278 --> 01:09:26,437
<i>Now the coin toss.</i>

766
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,443
Kickoff time.

767
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:31,076
My favorite thing.

768
01:09:37,752 --> 01:09:39,295
Laces out!

769
01:09:58,568 --> 01:10:02,068
I made some refreshments, Dan.

770
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,857
Would you like some refreshments, Dan?

771
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:09,071
I'll be right back, Dan.

772
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:43,405
I don't know how much psycho-woman's
paying you, but I'll double it.

773
01:10:43,662 --> 01:10:46,866
Sorry.
"Psycho-woman" keeps us out of prison.

774
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,833
Snowflake, here you go. Come on.

775
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:51,753
Check it out, Marino.

776
01:10:51,963 --> 01:10:54,289
I'm throwing passes to a dolphin.

777
01:11:04,728 --> 01:11:05,558
Damn!

778
01:11:05,771 --> 01:11:07,563
Go get some more fish!

779
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:09,441
I'm gonna kill that dolphin.

780
01:11:10,735 --> 01:11:12,360
Lovely party.

781
01:11:12,612 --> 01:11:14,356
Pity I wasn't invited.

782
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:28,955
Where the hell's the smelt?

783
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,927
Unconscious. Exactly as I planned.

784
01:11:47,653 --> 01:11:49,112
What the hell was that?

785
01:12:00,251 --> 01:12:01,331
Shit!

786
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:10,094
What happened? What's going on?

787
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:11,295
You okay?

788
01:12:11,848 --> 01:12:12,879
Guess what?

789
01:12:13,308 --> 01:12:14,339
It's naptime!

790
01:12:17,021 --> 01:12:18,480
<i>What a hit!</i>

791
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:22,729
Heads up!

792
01:12:29,076 --> 01:12:30,191
Who are you?

793
01:12:31,454 --> 01:12:34,871
Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.
I've been sent with a special play:

794
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,750
The quarterback sneak.

795
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:38,667
Penalty!

796
01:12:39,213 --> 01:12:42,049
Too many men on the field.

797
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:44,669
I warned you, Ventura.

798
01:12:45,429 --> 01:12:46,923
Whatever happened to "Ace"?

799
01:12:47,139 --> 01:12:48,931
Good question.

800
01:12:49,517 --> 01:12:54,014
Be careful with that phone.
In time, you could develop a tumor.

801
01:12:54,648 --> 01:12:56,973
Aguado, it's Lieutenant Einhorn.

802
01:12:57,234 --> 01:13:00,983
Send some men over
to the Hallandale yacht basin.

803
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:03,647
I've got the kidnapper
trapped in the warehouse.

804
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:06,774
It's Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.

805
01:13:10,458 --> 01:13:13,625
<i>Code 11 in progress,</i>
<i>343 Victorville Road...</i>

806
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:15,456
<i>... at the Palmdale basin.</i>

807
01:13:15,672 --> 01:13:18,958
<i>Officer needs backup.</i>
<i>Suspect's name: Ace Ventura...</i>

808
01:13:19,218 --> 01:13:21,792
<i>... should be considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

809
01:13:22,514 --> 01:13:25,183
It's Ace. We gotta break out of here.

810
01:13:27,811 --> 01:13:29,140
Is he in trouble?

811
01:13:29,397 --> 01:13:31,805
Don't worry, if there's
one thing I know...

812
01:13:32,066 --> 01:13:34,273
...there's nothing Ace can't handle.

813
01:13:34,903 --> 01:13:37,192
Don't kill me!

814
01:13:38,782 --> 01:13:40,491
Please!

815
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:43,241
I'll never tell anyone, I swear.

816
01:13:43,496 --> 01:13:45,822
- He's who you want! Kill him!
- Kill him!

817
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,835
Kill him! He held the ball, remember?

818
01:13:49,086 --> 01:13:50,664
Come on, look at him!

819
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:52,167
- Crybaby!
- Jock!

820
01:13:52,423 --> 01:13:53,337
- Wimp.
- Musclehead.

821
01:13:53,591 --> 01:13:55,086
Shut up!

822
01:13:55,343 --> 01:13:59,721
I think I'll kill the dolphin first.
I wouldn't want you to miss that.

823
01:14:00,308 --> 01:14:02,099
<i>And there's the snap.</i>

824
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:03,223
<i>The kick!</i>

825
01:14:03,478 --> 01:14:05,518
<i>And it's good!</i>

826
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:08,648
Good to see somebody who
doesn't buckle under the pressure!

827
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:18,028
What would you know about pressure?

828
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:20,867
Well, I have kissed a man.

829
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:26,204
<i>Of course, there's never been</i>
<i>a more crucial kick in a Super Bowl...</i>

830
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:28,747
<i>... than the "kick</i>
<i>heard around the world."</i>

831
01:14:29,258 --> 01:14:34,336
<i>I mean, it's clear to me that it was</i>
<i>a good hold. Finkle just booted it.</i>

832
01:14:35,432 --> 01:14:36,926
The laces were in!

833
01:14:37,392 --> 01:14:39,017
They were in!

834
01:14:59,293 --> 01:15:00,918
You like that?

835
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:02,333
You like that?

836
01:15:07,844 --> 01:15:09,718
And that! And that!

837
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:22,648
Having a little trouble with the lady?

838
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,529
You don't understand...

839
01:15:24,781 --> 01:15:25,979
...she's a...

840
01:15:28,994 --> 01:15:30,904
Get him, Lois! Get him!

841
01:15:34,834 --> 01:15:36,245
Get him!

842
01:15:42,927 --> 01:15:43,958
Shoot him!

843
01:15:46,014 --> 01:15:48,054
- Shoot him!
- Hold your fire!

844
01:15:49,852 --> 01:15:51,014
Don't shoot!

845
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:53,470
Put your guns down, or this cop gets it!

846
01:15:54,273 --> 01:15:55,732
I mean it!

847
01:15:56,192 --> 01:15:58,399
She's not joking!

848
01:15:58,612 --> 01:16:00,154
He kidnapped Snowflake!

849
01:16:00,406 --> 01:16:04,985
He killed Roger Podacter and was about
to kill Marino and me!

850
01:16:07,873 --> 01:16:10,364
Fiction can be fun!

851
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:13,544
But I find the reference section
much more enlightening.

852
01:16:13,796 --> 01:16:15,172
For instance...

853
01:16:15,423 --> 01:16:16,668
...if you look up...

854
01:16:16,925 --> 01:16:21,386
...professional football's
all-time bonehead plays...

855
01:16:21,931 --> 01:16:25,347
...you might read about a Miami Dolphin
kicker named Ray Finkle...

856
01:16:25,601 --> 01:16:30,229
...who missed a 26-yard field goal
in the closing seconds of Super Bowl 17.

857
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:36,943
You wouldn't read that Finkle
was committed to a mental hospital...

858
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:40,484
...only to escape and join the police...

859
01:16:40,744 --> 01:16:43,948
...in a scheme
to get even with Marino...

860
01:16:44,206 --> 01:16:46,330
...whom he blamed for the entire thing!

861
01:16:47,794 --> 01:16:49,538
What are you talking about?

862
01:16:49,755 --> 01:16:53,919
She's not Lois Einhorn!
She's Ray Finkle! She's a man!

863
01:16:54,135 --> 01:16:55,214
He's lying!

864
01:16:55,470 --> 01:16:56,750
Shoot him!

865
01:16:59,933 --> 01:17:03,018
Let's just see who's lying, shall we?

866
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:07,269
Would a real woman have to wear
one of these?

867
01:17:13,282 --> 01:17:15,358
Boy, that's really on there!

868
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:17,618
But tell me this:

869
01:17:17,829 --> 01:17:19,407
Would a real woman...

870
01:17:19,664 --> 01:17:21,871
...be missing these?

871
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,211
That kind of surgery can be done
over the weekend.

872
01:17:30,761 --> 01:17:32,588
But I doubt very much...

873
01:17:33,138 --> 01:17:36,840
...if he could find the time
during his busy schedule...

874
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:38,430
...to get rid of...

875
01:17:38,686 --> 01:17:39,718
...big old...

876
01:17:39,938 --> 01:17:41,563
...Mr. Knish!

877
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:50,902
Oh, boy!

878
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:55,159
Come here.

879
01:17:55,998 --> 01:17:58,834
Would you excuse me for just one second?

880
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:08,844
Ladies and gentlemen...

881
01:18:09,514 --> 01:18:12,350
...my esteemed colleague, Mr. Marino...

882
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:15,303
...brought new evidence to my attention.

883
01:18:15,563 --> 01:18:16,559
Now...

884
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:20,807
...history has certainly shown
that even the most intuitive...

885
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:23,905
...criminal investigator can be wrong.

886
01:18:24,156 --> 01:18:26,196
But if I am mistaken...

887
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:29,535
...if the lieutenant
is indeed a woman...

888
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,077
...as she claims to be...

889
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:33,495
...then, my friend...

890
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:38,330
...she is suffering from the worst case
of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!

891
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:42,172
That's why Roger Podacter is dead!

892
01:18:42,386 --> 01:18:44,842
He found Captain Winkie!

893
01:18:54,108 --> 01:18:55,187
Good night!

894
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:58,936
You've been a wonderful audience.
Be sure to tip your waitress.

895
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:05,987
Die, animal boy!

896
01:19:06,789 --> 01:19:08,118
Quick decision.

897
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:31,692
Loser!

898
01:19:38,743 --> 01:19:40,071
You have any more gum?

899
01:19:40,328 --> 01:19:44,623
That's none of your damn business.
Stay out of my personal affairs.

900
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:48,039
You're a weird guy, Ace. A weird guy.

901
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:51,961
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

902
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:54,002
<i>... the Miami Dolphins are proud...</i>

903
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:57,055
<i>... to welcome back</i>
<i>to Joe Robbie Stadium...</i>

904
01:19:57,264 --> 01:19:58,925
<i>... our beloved mascot...</i>

905
01:19:59,142 --> 01:20:01,977
<i>... and the star of our halftime show:</i>

906
01:20:02,187 --> 01:20:03,930
<i>Snowflake!</i>

907
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:12,530
<i>And now...</i>

908
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:16,406
<i>... returning for the second half,</i>
<i>the Dolphins' most valuable player...</i>

909
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:19,286
<i>... Dan Marino!</i>

910
01:21:05,302 --> 01:21:06,132
Idiot!

911
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:12,133
Do you know what you've done?
You just cost me 25 grand, Polly.

912
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:14,345
Yeah? Blow me!

913
01:21:16,064 --> 01:21:17,393
Really?

914
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:34,370
<i>The National Football League...</i>

915
01:21:34,586 --> 01:21:39,332
<i>... would like to offer a special thank-</i>
<i>you to the man who rescued Dan Marino...</i>

916
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:41,009
<i>... and our beloved Snowflake.</i>

917
01:21:41,594 --> 01:21:43,219
<i>A great humanitarian...</i>

918
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:45,548
<i>... and a lover of all animals:</i>

919
01:21:45,932 --> 01:21:48,934
<i>Mr. Ace Ventura!</i>

920
01:21:50,938 --> 01:21:52,433
Get off me!

921
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,400
Get off me!

922
01:21:59,657 --> 01:22:04,782
<i>Tone, put that big-ass size 13 on</i>
<i>and kick it for the homies.</i>

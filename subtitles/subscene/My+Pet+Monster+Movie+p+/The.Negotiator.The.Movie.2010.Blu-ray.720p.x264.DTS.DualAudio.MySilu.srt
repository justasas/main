1
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,626
Stop!

2
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,348
"THE NEGATIATOR: THE MOVIE"

3
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,644
"THE HEAD GAME AT 1 0,000 M. ALTITUDE"

4
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,194
It will soon be 1 2 hrs.
since the incident occurred.

5
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:40,367
This morning, a security van
was attacked on a street in Kamata.

6
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:45,414
260 million yen in cash
was stolen by

7
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,750
a group of 3 perpetrators,

8
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,754
who broke through the emergency cordon.

9
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,340
The perpetrators seem to be armed.

10
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,719
With their escape route severed,

11
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,889
the perpetrators drove
their vehicle into a shopping mall

12
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:07,519
and took some 50 shoppers
and store clerks who were there.

13
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,814
The perpetrator group
consists of 3 males.

14
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,151
One is between 60 to 70 years of age.

15
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,713
Yuji, did you know?

16
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,465
Big bro, don't talk.

17
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,177
We were supposed to be fired yesterday.

18
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,350
They only want half the part-timers.

19
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,936
That sucks.

20
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,354
Hey, you there!

21
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,109
Told you not to talk.

22
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:56,902
Sorry.

23
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,736
Come.

24
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,407
I'll blow your brains out.

25
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,177
Kill the lights, dammit.

26
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:34,815
A perpetrator has appeared
with a gun on a hostage's head.

27
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,899
I repeat.

28
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,734
At 7:23 p.m.

29
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,821
one of the perpetrators...

30
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,491
Check their faces on the database.

31
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,867
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,050
It's long past 30 min.

33
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,804
Don't you care about the hostages?

34
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,707
I'm Reiko Usagi (Bunny), MPD
Special Investigation Squad.

35
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,672
You're hurt. Are you okay?

36
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:43,383
Never mind. What's the answer?

37
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,763
I don't talk to you.

38
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,619
I apologize the response is delayed.

39
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,163
And?

40
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,289
We are trying.

41
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,749
Only...

42
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:21,922
It's not easy to find a bus
with more than 50 seats.

43
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,969
We can get a micro-bus with 20 seats.

44
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,347
Oh, really?

45
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:36,269
In return, release the 30 hostages
who cannot board the bus.

46
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,231
What do you say to this condition?

47
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,360
Bunny's going for the frontal attack.

48
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,947
Insp. Kizaki, the list of the hostages.

49
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,573
Chief.

50
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,373
Identities of the hostages confirmed.

51
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,793
Hostages' hands are bond by duct tape.

52
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,878
Not going to the scene?

53
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,713
Promotion test's coming up.

54
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:10,262
Heard a siege situation like this
comes out it in the test.

55
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,768
Don't you have to go out there?

56
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:21,106
I'm worried about his studies.

57
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,399
Coming along?

58
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:23,817
Yes.

59
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,362
Yumi, that hand. You're too friendly.

60
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,575
Just for the record,

61
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,328
tell me your name.

62
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,622
Lay off him.

63
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,249
Your name.

64
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,295
It's...Yusuke Kimoto.

65
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,630
Mr. Yusuke Kimoto.

66
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,842
Yusuke Kimoto. He's a part-timer.

67
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,888
One with the gun is Kazuo Tanimura.

68
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,765
2 priors or robbery and assault.

69
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,935
Seems to go berserk when excited.

70
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,690
The uniform they hit,
breaking through the road block.

71
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,860
died in the hospital.

72
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,790
Tanimura, come back in.

73
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,462
These bastards are playing with us.

74
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,173
I said come back in.

75
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,177
He's one of you, but can't control him?

76
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,722
Yes, that's right.

77
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:42,145
The situation can end shamefully

78
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,482
unless it is resolved quickly.

79
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,276
What about my terms?

80
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:55,033
Ah, yes. Please give us
some time to think about them.

81
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,079
We will respond as soon as we can.

82
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,082
He's too calm. This is bad.

83
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,584
Could be bad news.

84
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,506
There's no time.

85
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:16,137
You're really a nag, aren't you?

86
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,139
Okay?

87
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,520
Tanimura, I don't want you to forget

88
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:29,234
that what we are conspiring
is an orthodox hostage situation.

89
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,197
At least so far.

90
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,683
CI Chief.

91
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,062
But...that is...

92
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,776
What's going on?

93
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,446
Supt. Kirisawa. I'm Nakamaru, SAT.

94
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,582
You seem to...lack calmness.

95
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,253
Shut up.

96
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,966
What?

97
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,135
That gun...

98
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,513
I'll keep it.

99
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,228
I promised the hostages
won't be harmed.

100
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:54,152
I...never...never...lie!

101
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,365
Under this circumstance

102
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:03,953
can you be certain
you can control yourself?

103
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,484
Chief, a gunshot in the mall.

104
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,363
I heard a gunshot.

105
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,657
A gun was fired inside.

106
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:43,618
Bunny, get away from there.

107
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,666
Bunny! Get back!

108
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,878
What? What happened?

109
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,630
What do you think?

110
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,925
Well?

111
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,470
Is the weight of life the same

112
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,683
for everyone?

113
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:14,816
Get back.

114
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,525
But...

115
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,444
SAT is in command.

116
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,612
Forced assault...

117
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,990
MPD General's order.

118
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,283
- We've just begun.

119
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,034
It's already 1 2 hrs.

120
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,536
It's not time wasted.

121
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,247
Bunny.

122
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,466
Have you heard of Mark Chapman?

123
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,595
Shot John Lennon.

124
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,721
Did he really?

125
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,348
On Dec. 8th exactly 30 years ago,

126
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,685
in front of Dakota House in N.Y.,

127
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:55,106
a 25-year old man named Mark Chapman

128
00:12:55,232 --> 00:13:00,361
shot ex-Beatles John Lennon
in the back 5 times.

129
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,742
He was arrested on the spot

130
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,245
and is still in prison.

131
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,748
What's he getting at?

132
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,752
What if he is released on bail?

133
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:20,840
He will likely be killed
by John Lennon's fans.

134
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:25,303
Justice Dept. thinks so
and won't release him.

135
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,554
Listen well.

136
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:31,351
Mark Chapman killed
an international celebrity

137
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:36,314
but his life is protected by the state.

138
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,565
Obviously,

139
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,446
isn't there a difference
in the weight of life?

140
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,459
Why did cut the line?

141
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,878
Why?

142
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:04,050
Not only the weight of life.

143
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,804
What about our world now?

144
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:13,768
Are people guaranteed lifestyles,
befitting their hard work?

145
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,565
Honest people lose out and are battered.

146
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,900
Don't you want to

147
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,822
change such a world?

148
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:32,287
I am confident I can change the world.

149
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,621
I will

150
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,749
show you that.

151
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,552
They'll go for

152
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,138
forced assault.

153
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,725
Everybody, bear witness.

154
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:58,855
The time has come.

155
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,109
Cut the line?

156
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,573
No intention to negotiate further.

157
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,872
Usagi!

158
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,790
No! Stop!

159
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,991
It's a trap!

160
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,118
Stop! Perpetrators are among them.

161
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,244
Are you all right?

162
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,571
Freeze!

163
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:20,496
Lose the gun.

164
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,596
He's apprehended.

165
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
How do you

166
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,240
change the world?

167
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,332
How?

168
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,876
Just watch

169
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,756
what I do.

170
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,681
Watch you?

171
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,560
Tell me. How do you do it?

172
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,328
More on Kamata Shopping Mall.

173
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:48,334
Secured by the police, the hostages
were transported to a hospital

174
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,586
for treatment of injuries.

175
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,757
I was blindfolded.
Didn't know what happened.

176
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,093
It's aired nationwide.

177
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,594
Yusuke! Watch this!

178
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,602
How much savings do you have?

179
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,692
No money, no work. Get a life.

180
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,069
Damn it.

181
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,741
The money the perpetrator left.
Should've taken it.

182
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,076
Big bro.

183
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,371
C'mon. I'm just kidding.

184
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,503
So hot.

185
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,280
We also know
there was another accomplice.

186
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:05,411
After the explosion, he escaped,
hiding among the 50 odd hostages.

187
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,262
METROPLITAN POLICE DEPT.
2ND BLDG.

188
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,644
When the line was cut,
I realized it was a trap.

189
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,812
But it was too late.

190
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,524
And we overlooked the perpetrator
among the hostages.

191
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,568
Couldn't be helped

192
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,488
in that chaos.

193
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,119
He...still hasn't spoken a word.

194
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,666
This is the gun you had.

195
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,753
Can't trace his identity from
fingerprints and items on him.

196
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,465
Who the hell is he?

197
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:07,139
He could've escaped if he wanted to.

198
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,518
Besides all the money was there.

199
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,986
Oh, whatever.
It's not our case anymore.

200
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:30,037
Yes. I'll take the evening flight
on the 27th as scheduled.

201
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,165
At New Chitose Airport...

202
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,628
Yes, I will be there. Thank you.

203
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,343
Hokkaido? That's great.

204
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:50,975
Heard you took a vacation
at the same time as me.

205
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,772
There's nothing worse
than running into you.

206
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,277
Seeing seals at Asahiyama Zoo?

207
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,821
No, I'm not.

208
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,908
Ah...attending my high school friend's
wedding reception.

209
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:12,955
Find a guy there and get married.
And don't come back.

210
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,877
Kizaki, where are you going?

211
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,086
At least it's not

212
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:23,382
Hokkaido.

213
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,947
Everyday...I see the same dream.

214
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,409
Of what?

215
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,663
Of you dying.

216
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,835
7 years...

217
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,343
For 7 years you come

218
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,722
to visit me every single week.

219
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:17,228
Because you say you'll die, if I don't.

220
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,735
Why do I see the same dream?

221
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,329
I thought our meeting

222
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:43,003
would be terminated
only by my execution.

223
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,590
Never thought

224
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,929
you'd die before me.

225
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,936
See the dream, too?

226
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,023
No.

227
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:08,237
Then, why that look just now?

228
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,909
Why did you have that look?

229
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,999
You never cease

230
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,044
to surprise me.

231
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,634
What do you mean?

232
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,054
What do you mean?!

233
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,519
Only I can understand that.

234
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:47,735
Today, you came to bid
your eternal farewell.

235
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,695
That is what

236
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,866
only I can understand.

237
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,765
Please come again.

238
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,226
Thank you. Please come again.

239
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,820
That passenger's name and flight No.

240
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:37,201
Flight 201 for Hokkaido.
Name: Kazuo Takada.

241
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,789
Kimoto, Yusuke.

242
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,499
How do I do it?

243
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,159
It's a fine day today.

244
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,501
Ma'am.

245
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,754
Police?

246
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,230
Ma'am.

247
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,148
Later.

248
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,734
We are taking off. Please sit down.

249
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,916
Hey, this plane's going to Kita-Kyushu.

250
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,462
You're going to Hokkaido. Aren't you?

251
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,852
MAIL SENT

252
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,854
RECEIVED MAIL

253
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,863
Chief Kirisawa.

254
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:38,989
What's up?

255
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,201
A photo from Usagi's mobile.

256
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,328
From Bunny?

257
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,127
Who is it?

258
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,381
A pretty boy. And young. Some catch.

259
00:27:55,507 --> 00:28:00,052
Showing off her guy from a plane?

260
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,310
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Ready.

261
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,940
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Done.

262
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,445
- Horsepower 201 pound thrust
- Got it.

263
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,965
From that hostage case?

264
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:42,010
He was a hostage.
His name is Yusuke Kimoto.

265
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,512
So?

266
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:48,434
He drew my attention,
and somehow stayed that way.

267
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,561
Somehow, huh?

268
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,396
Oh, no, not again.

269
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:57,151
Your somehow
always leads to big trouble.

270
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,528
Much obliged.

271
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,946
Ouch!

272
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,366
Who is that?

273
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,830
Just a colleague, who
somehow gets on the wrong plane.

274
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,088
It's still confidential.

275
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:23,510
My fiancee...Yuka Donoue.

276
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,389
How do you do? I'm Usagi.

277
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,144
Wasn't told about her.

278
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,062
Neither was I.

279
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,440
I won't bother you.

280
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,619
You should've reported it
before we took off.

281
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,579
I'm sorry.

282
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,879
Hey, give me a break.

283
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,883
Should've told you
before take-of, but...

284
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,510
What shall we do?

285
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,720
Go back to Haneda.

286
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:12,100
Police officer or not, if not
on the passenger list, we can't fly.

287
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,268
Contact ACC.

288
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,728
Copy that.

289
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,525
Skybird two zero one request
turning back toward Haneda Airport

290
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,780
What's wrong with her?

291
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,323
What's going on?

292
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:31,161
Usagi is a stowaway
on Skybird 201 for Kita-Kyushuu.

293
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:35,040
Captain's message
via Air Traffic Bureau.

294
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:40,712
Against the law. Plane'll return
to Haneda to get her off board.

295
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,298
I knew it.

296
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:48,262
Kizaki is on that Skybird 201
bound for Kita-Kyushu.

297
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,347
He left a memo.

298
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,936
Something going on with him?

299
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,396
Nothing really.

300
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,148
Well, about this man...

301
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,737
He looks like a hostage in...

302
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,588
Yusuke, can't quit now.

303
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,672
I know.

304
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,569
What do you think?

305
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,864
I think it's unlikely, but...

306
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,325
Unlikely, huh?

307
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:46,088
I can do it...I can do it.

308
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,334
It's your unlikely, Usagi.

309
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,963
I smelled oil...gun oil.

310
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:57,928
I'm not mistaken. I hate this smell.

311
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:04,434
I'm sorry. I go first.

312
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,504
Be quiet.

313
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,596
Some cold drinks.

314
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,348
Here you are.

315
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,442
Don't do anything.

316
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,534
Passengers, please listen.

317
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:10,709
This plane will now
be under our control.

318
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,467
Behave and you won't be harmed.

319
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,222
Don't go now.

320
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,107
Knew it.

321
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,442
Hijack.

322
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:39,070
Don't you have a better excuse?

323
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,743
Stay in your seats.

324
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,746
Is he the only hijacker?

325
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,917
He's just a kid. It won't be hard.

326
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,168
C'mon.

327
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,378
With my signal

328
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,089
we both take him.

329
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,759
All right?

330
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,387
Another must've entered the cockpit.

331
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,181
Then, he's alone here?

332
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,599
You never know.

333
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,184
If he's alone...

334
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,562
Let's take him.

335
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,903
Later.

336
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,820
Now.

337
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,666
Better not come up with funny ideas.

338
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,682
So, there was another one.

339
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,618
Captain, how come
Mt. Fuji's on our left?

340
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,870
Flying in the opposite direction.

341
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,916
We're going back to Haneda.

342
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,210
What? Why are we going back?

343
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,629
What for?

344
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,507
What is it?

345
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,801
Heading back to Haneda.

346
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,637
Why?

347
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,890
Something happened.

348
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:34,477
Suspected instrument malfunction,

349
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,899
but seems sound now.

350
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,738
If so,

351
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,616
fly the official course.

352
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,715
Move those passengers here.

353
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,216
Hurry!

354
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,732
What did you just push?

355
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,525
Hasegawa.

356
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,570
Come back.

357
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,326
Hijack signal!

358
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,541
Issue emergency.

359
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,215
Fasten seatbelts securely.

360
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,300
Please don't stand up.

361
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,886
What happened?

362
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,639
Fasten seatbelts...

363
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,266
It's a hijack.

364
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,535
Are you all right? We'll get help.

365
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,956
Passenger list.

366
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,668
The passenger list. Hurry up

367
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,017
The name?

368
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,312
Hurry up.

369
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,861
My wife is ill.

370
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:48,945
I'm sorry.

371
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,867
I am truly sorry.

372
00:40:54,994 --> 00:41:00,248
What's the ransom demand?
Must be about 500 million?

373
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,423
I'm Kirisawa, MPD,
Special Investigation Squad.

374
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,383
I'm Supt. Sakuma.

375
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,052
- Anything from the hijackers?
Not yet.

376
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:22,020
Please transfer the line here?
Need to record the voices.

377
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,731
Can you do it?

378
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,860
I will, but there are other planes.

379
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,448
We won't interfere.
Okay, guys, let's do our work.

380
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,827
This is flight 201 .

381
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,838
Are the police there?

382
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,803
I'm Kirisawa, MPD SIS.

383
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,932
Hello.

384
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,809
There are some things to confirm.

385
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,188
Any injured?

386
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,983
Yes, there is.

387
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,364
Co-pilot Hasegawa was shot.

388
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,199
Hey, don't bud in.

389
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,784
How bad is it?

390
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:23,373
Not treated for long,
he could bleed to death.

391
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,457
POSSESSES GUN

392
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,002
Is there a doctor or a nurse on board?

393
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:29,837
Is there?

394
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:34,509
Things don't always
work out so conveniently.

395
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,517
Trying to play a nurse?

396
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,602
If I can get near them...

397
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,020
Don't be rash.

398
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,113
DEAR MOM AND DAD,
THANKS FOR BRING ME UP...

399
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,868
Regular mobiles
won't work in this altitude.

400
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,001
How can I contact land?

401
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:12,964
With a satellite mobile.
Regular passengers won't have one.

402
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:15,258
Maybe the crew. For emergency?

403
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,218
If so, the pilot.

404
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,096
The pilot...

405
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:25,393
But the cockpit is
under control of the hijackers.

406
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,364
Your name. Tell me your name.

407
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,868
What's it to you?

408
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,746
Is he Yusuke Kimoto?

409
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:52,045
The voice-mark doesn't match.
He's a 35 to 40 year-old male.

410
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,671
Have it your way.

411
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:58,217
From now on, I'll call you Mr. Asshole.

412
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,513
Very funny.

413
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:07,685
Well, Mr. Asshole, first...

414
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,104
I'm Mark Chapman.

415
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,232
Is he joking?

416
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,985
Playing his game, huh?

417
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,446
Either way, he's an asshole.

418
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:24,410
Well, then, as you like, Mr. Chapman.

419
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,831
Let us confirm
as our mutual understanding.

420
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,543
You and I are responsible

421
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:36,631
for the lives of
1 59 passengers and crew.

422
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,470
Let us continue our talk
with that in mind.

423
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,725
The weight of life...

424
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,646
How heavy is it?

425
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,986
NAME

426
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,032
Who is he searching for?

427
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,660
This is bad.

428
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,165
My name is not on the passenger list.

429
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:30,476
IF YOU HAVE SATELLITE MOBILE,
CONTACT NEAREST CA.

430
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:38,359
Your name.

431
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,696
Seiichiro Kizaki.

432
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,659
Not on the list.

433
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,787
There is no Kizaki.

434
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,373
Impossible...Look carefully.

435
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,333
My fault.

436
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:59,589
When reserving tickets,
I registered you as Donoue.

437
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:04,218
I haven't decided
to marry into your family.

438
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,255
Well, then, Mr. Chapman,
what is your purpose?

439
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:46,344
Why are you and
your associates doing this?

440
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,931
We have one demand.

441
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,935
HIJACKER ? PLURAL

442
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:56,771
Mr. Keiichi Mido is detained
at Kamata East Police St.

443
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:01,651
We demand his immediate release.

444
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,781
Keiichiro Mido?

445
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,411
We want Master Mido

446
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:15,581
returned to us.

447
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,041
Master?

448
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:27,593
We will give you 1 hour to respond.

449
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,762
After that,

450
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:35,184
we'll kill a passenger every minute.

451
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,062
They can't do that.

452
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,830
Was he there?

453
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,915
Yes, 57-K.

454
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,924
Ex-Diet member sec. Yoshinao Kawano.

455
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,844
What do we do next?

456
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:15,016
Big bro., calm down.

457
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,185
Take all he has on him.

458
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,605
- Yes, I will.
Shall I do it?

459
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,772
I can do it.

460
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,697
At present, the hijackers demand

461
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:33,743
immediate release of Keiichiro Mido.

462
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,996
No demand for ransom.

463
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,833
Who is this Mido character?

464
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,422
CREATE THE FUTURE LEAGUE

465
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,007
Political society?

466
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,509
Under investigation now.

467
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,098
You're Kirisawa, right?

468
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,350
Yes, sir.

469
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:02,438
Is the safety of
the crew and passengers confirmed?

470
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,982
Not all is accounted for,

471
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,403
but the co-pilot was shot
and seriously injured.

472
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,033
And in the additional report

473
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,496
by coincidence,
SIS members Capt. Kizaki and

474
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,916
Sgt. Usagi are on that plane.

475
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,837
So, are they coping
with the situation aboard?

476
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:30,800
At present, we are
unable to contact them.

477
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,135
We are in the dark.

478
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,638
It's a dangerous situation.

479
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,642
Could they take action on their own?

480
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:44,230
They have been trained
to act calmly and rationally.

481
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:50,152
I assure you they would
never act recklessly.

482
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,881
Excuse me.

483
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,262
The cabin has calmed down.

484
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,515
Let me see.

485
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,392
Don't worry. You'll make it.

486
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,985
Can't treat him here.
May we move him to the cabin?

487
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,946
Please.

488
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,907
Thank you very much.

489
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,874
Oh, and Capt. Kano.

490
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:49,003
Ventilation of ducts
connecting top and bottom is bad.

491
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,755
Top and bottom?

492
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:52,089
Yes.

493
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,259
Connecting top and bottom.

494
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,846
If possible, open some other duct.

495
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,686
Hey, wait.

496
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,981
Besides that...

497
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:14,028
Negotiate with the police all you want,

498
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,697
but think about this plane, too.

499
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:24,455
This plane has fuel
for less than an hour.

500
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,667
It's bound for Kita-Kyushu.

501
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,255
It should fly for 5 more hrs.

502
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:38,552
You know we almost had to
go back to Haneda.

503
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,388
So what?

504
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:45,935
Passenger planes fly
on a delicate balance of weight.

505
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,563
Weight of 1 59 passengers and crew,

506
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,981
weight of cargo.

507
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,526
and weight of fuel.

508
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:59,156
The plane was too heavy
to go back soon after take-off.

509
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,912
You dumped most of
the fuel at that time?

510
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,498
Anyway, this plane

511
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,334
has less than an hour left.

512
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,565
Hey. Hey.

513
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,400
What?

514
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:37,444
This was passed around.

515
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,450
If you have satellite mobile,
contact nearest CA.

516
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,247
Who passed this?

517
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,714
Damn it! Who is it?

518
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,139
Excuse me.

519
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:11,770
I've been trying to
hold it, but I need to go.

520
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,274
Please let me.

521
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,736
Sure. You may.

522
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,487
Me, too.

523
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,031
In your dreams.

524
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,490
Big bro.

525
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,367
Okay. One at a time.

526
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,662
Ah, can you...

527
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,080
Yes?

528
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,833
You see my flight bag there?

529
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:37,463
Can you take out the operation manual?

530
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,342
It's in the inner pocket.

531
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,927
I see.

532
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,189
Find it?

533
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:58,025
It's an A-4 size sheet.

534
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,987
Manual on ducts
connecting top and bottom.

535
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,576
Thank you.

536
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:10,329
BON DANCE FESTIVAL

537
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:11,705
Yes, this is it.

538
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,876
Hard work, but it's worthwhile.
Keep it up.

539
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:19,213
Thank you very much.

540
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,514
You saved my skin.

541
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:36,522
I felt he's a type to go berserk,
if he loses his head.

542
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,233
What do you think?

543
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:44,822
If we separate them,
we can each take on one.

544
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,033
Hurry up and go.

545
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,370
Hang on a bit more.

546
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:56,333
Trying to be a hero
at such a time can be fatal.

547
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,128
Hello.

548
00:54:59,254 --> 00:54:59,962
This is Usagi.

549
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,880
Bunny?

550
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,050
Where are you?

551
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,555
In the toilet. I'm using
the captain's satellite mobile.

552
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,848
The facts.

553
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,685
3 perpetrators.
The main in the cockpit:

554
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,937
Other 2 are in the cabin.

555
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,439
2 in the cabin...

556
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,025
Can't they take them?

557
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,276
Prime Minister.

558
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,903
Any demands from them?

559
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:29,533
Yes, the release
of that shopping mall perpetrator.

560
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,541
The police announced
the hijackers' demand.

561
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,841
Kiichiro Mido, principal perpetrator of
the shopping mall incident 7 days ago

562
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:48,677
is detained at Kamata Police St.

563
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,896
The hijackers are demanding
his immediate release.

564
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,649
Are 2 incidents related?
Police are examining this.

565
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,568
Mido?

566
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,738
Keiichiro?

567
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,240
There's no time.

568
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:16,038
Perpetrators say they will
kill the passengers after 30 min.

569
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,831
They're only bluffing.

570
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,084
With all due respect,

571
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,921
such optimism can be dangerous.

572
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:28,717
And the plane's fuel
won't last one hour.

573
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:34,723
The perpetrators are
beginning to be desperate.

574
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:38,936
You think
we should give in to hijackers?

575
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,563
Release Mido whatever his name?

576
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:47,736
The fact is: 159 lives are
in the hands of the hijackers.

577
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:51,198
We are not yielding to such morons.

578
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:55,160
Our country does not
yield to terrorists.

579
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:02,709
Each of those 159 hostages
has a family.

580
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,547
Friends and a lover, too.

581
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,845
Only 30 more minutes.

582
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,989
Some case we have.

583
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,492
Katayama, what brings you here?

584
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,537
Went to Haneda guarding
Foreign Minister, but got stopped.

585
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,040
His trip's cancelled.

586
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,085
Came to watch to kill time?

587
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:49,047
Of course not. Foreign Minister's
worried about this case.

588
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,635
Knowing we're friends, he wants me
to persuade you unofficially.

589
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,512
Persuade?

590
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,893
Defense Ministry has been told.

591
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:06,064
The hijacked plane is maneuvered
to US military monitored zone,

592
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,776
it'll give US an excuse
to scramble their Phantoms.

593
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,572
Shoot down a private plane?

594
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,575
It's just an option.

595
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,952
Hey, we're conversing unofficially.

596
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,663
So, their true colors.

597
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,919
They want to show that
our gov't won't yield to terrorists.

598
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:31,215
I'll have Flight 201 land safely.

599
00:58:31,966 --> 00:58:34,134
I don't care if our gov't loses face.

600
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,598
Tell Foreign Minister I said so.

601
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:43,101
So sure of yourself. How come?

602
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,648
Cause Bunny and Kizaki are on board.

603
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,694
Kirisawa.

604
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,947
Why didn't you say so?

605
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,826
Oh, hi.

606
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,328
You're doing well.

607
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,830
Supt. Kirisawa.

608
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,001
Any information?

609
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:11,463
A tenant in Mido's ex-flat said

610
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:17,094
that when he moved in 5 years ago,
he told people he was a journalist.

611
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,679
A journalist?

612
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:23,725
Those, who stayed with him
to the end, adored him as a guru.

613
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,485
This is it.

614
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,947
POWER OF THE PRESS

615
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:43,537
INTERVIEW:
SOICHIRO AMAMIYA, JOURNALIST

616
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,092
It's so sad, isn't it?

617
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:08,395
Who'd have believed
he would be released

618
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,276
by such drastic means.

619
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,880
JOKER

620
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:40,469
Well prepared.
So, you have a satellite mobile.

621
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,141
I see...

622
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,145
So, that's it.

623
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,613
Don't tell me...

624
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:04,326
You want me
to persuade the young men

625
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:10,499
taking their stand up above.

626
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:16,838
Is that too much to ask?

627
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,216
You're a fool.

628
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,848
Is it funny?

629
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:40,362
Among the hijackers,
2 are real brothers.

630
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:45,909
Until now, they barely survived,
working part-time.

631
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:50,330
The brothers are
just ordinary young men.

632
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:53,166
What did you

633
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,337
do to them?

634
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:59,172
What did you say?

635
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,438
You're only using them.

636
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,442
They are seeking...such a thing.

637
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:23,697
Young people are like that.

638
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:32,456
They finally found
what they can stake their life for.

639
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:39,713
Now is their time of splendor.

640
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:45,969
Aren't they beautiful young men?

641
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:53,185
If I tell them to stop,

642
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,520
they will.

643
01:02:57,231 --> 01:03:00,609
If I tell them to kill, they will.

644
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,029
If I tell them to die,

645
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,616
they will.

646
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,583
Can't you see?

647
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:21,046
I am protected...like Mark Chapman.

648
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:34,518
Any response from below?

649
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,936
Not yet.

650
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:40,232
If the hour passes, we start killing, right?

651
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:44,194
I've decided which one to kill first.

652
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:55,121
So rich at that young age.
Can't stand him.

653
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:56,790
Big bro.

654
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,543
What's wrong? I'm one to do it.

655
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:03,880
We don't kill any hostage.
Mr. Mido said so, too.

656
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,508
This certainly isn't my day.

657
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:07,968
Shu.

658
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:13,098
Oh, well, if I die, that's that.

659
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,891
What're you saying?

660
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,065
Sir, it's no smoking.

661
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:24,526
Oh, give me a break.

662
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:30,115
And don't sir me.
I haven't been treated with respect.

663
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,747
There's no time.
The fuel runs out in 30 min.

664
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,834
The gov't just won't respond.

665
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:42,711
Can't afford to wait.

666
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,839
I agree.

667
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,387
I'll continue my negotiation
with the asshole.

668
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,766
While I keep him in the cockpit,

669
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:00,937
can you and Kizaki
take on the 2 in the cabin?

670
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,860
Yes.

671
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:11,865
As I start talking to the cockpit,
I'll ring your mobile once.

672
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,867
That's the cue.

673
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,245
Copy that.

674
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:34,220
This was passed around the passengers?

675
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:35,555
Yes.

676
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,978
Captain.

677
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,063
Yes?

678
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:51,780
If I'm not mistaken,
pilots of this airline

679
01:05:52,573 --> 01:05:57,243
are required to carry satellite mobiles.

680
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:03,458
it's a call from the control center.

681
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:04,918
Ignore it.

682
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,355
That bitch.

683
01:06:30,027 --> 01:06:34,572
THERE ARE 2 RATS
AMONG THE PASSENGERS.

684
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:37,951
You stay here.

685
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:43,039
That was good teamwork.

686
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:58,221
Why won't he answer? Asshole Chapman.

687
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,396
Chief, what's taking you?

688
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:21,286
Open up. Open up.

689
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:09,292
Come out! I know you're in there!

690
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:16,800
Come out!

691
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,889
Kimoto.

692
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:29,312
You've been on my mind,
since the shopping mall incident.

693
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:34,275
So when I saw you at Haneda Airport

694
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:39,656
I felt something bad
was going to happen.

695
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:46,162
That's why I followed you to this plane.

696
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:49,749
You're lying.
No, I'm not.

697
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,381
Being part of this, what's your future?

698
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:57,632
Shut up!

699
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,976
I want to talk.

700
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:11,312
I want to talk with you.

701
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:16,109
The decision you are about to make,

702
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:24,242
will change your future completely.

703
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,536
My future?

704
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:29,497
Are you able to kill people?

705
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,506
Are you?

706
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,509
Trust me.

707
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:45,513
I will protect you.

708
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,948
Must end this quickly.

709
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,910
To the rats hiding

710
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,662
somewhere in this plane.

711
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,876
I will slowly count to 5.

712
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,671
I recommend you come out
during the count.

713
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,383
If not...

714
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:27,847
some passengers will lie dead here.

715
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:30,892
1 ...

716
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:35,563
2...

717
01:10:37,691 --> 01:10:39,651
3...

718
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:46,783
C'mon, rats! Hurry up and come out! Rats!

719
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:55,625
You hear?

720
01:11:07,888 --> 01:11:09,347
As I thought.

721
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:13,059
So you're a rat.

722
01:11:14,186 --> 01:11:15,603
Not a rat, a bunny.

723
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:17,397
They're different.

724
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:24,112
How did you know about me?

725
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,994
A deck of cards has a Joker.

726
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:34,122
Now,

727
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:38,960
let's have the other rat come out.

728
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,256
Do you have time for this?

729
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:48,886
This plane will run out of fuel
in less than 30 min.

730
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,769
Negotiating takes time.

731
01:11:57,479 --> 01:12:01,357
To continue negotiations

732
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,818
you need to fuel up.

733
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:07,113
But the assault team
could take advantage.

734
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,948
Yes, they could.

735
01:12:09,074 --> 01:12:13,494
Passenger safety is my priority.
Let me handle it.

736
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,874
I will stop the assault team.

737
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:25,506
What I hate the most

738
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:29,218
are people, who subdue
everything with strength.

739
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,645
Those on the side of the state

740
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:43,858
willingly lie for their objective.

741
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:47,737
The police is the foremost example.

742
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,448
I don't lie.

743
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:55,453
If this plane crashes,
you won't achieve anything.

744
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:08,883
No more negotiations.

745
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,029
Bunny, what's going on?

746
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,241
Improvising can fail.

747
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,078
Unfortunately,

748
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,373
a passenger's dead.

749
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,294
You people are responsible.

750
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:55,388
Chief Kirisawa, Usagi's sister
and friend are...

751
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:00,768
I'm Rumiko Mimura. Where is my sister?

752
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,021
She's on leave, but I can't contact her.

753
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:10,945
I can't tell you the details,
but she's on an emergency duty.

754
01:14:12,322 --> 01:14:14,574
Didn't my sister tell you?

755
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:19,162
I introduced
a Sapporo hospital to Reiko.

756
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:20,913
Hospital?

757
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:26,127
The hospital called, because
Reiko didn't go. They're worried.

758
01:14:27,421 --> 01:14:28,588
About what?

759
01:14:28,714 --> 01:14:33,676
There's a blood clot in her heart.
Must be operated quickly.

760
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:39,098
I should've gone with her.

761
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:44,770
Reiko has a bomb in her heart.

762
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:48,107
Stress on her heart can be fatal.

763
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:53,362
I want my sister back!

764
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,575
Shall I kill you?

765
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:06,042
Then, in return, promise
to land this plane safely.

766
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:08,961
Trying to be cool?

767
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:13,216
The only bargaining point
is the release of Mr. Mido.

768
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,718
Nothing else.

769
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,026
Inspector General.

770
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,200
A gun was fired in the plane.

771
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,702
One passenger possibly dead.

772
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,496
But there's still time.

773
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:50,419
I guess we must reach a decision.

774
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:55,508
M. Kurihara, what do you propose?

775
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:59,387
Release Mido?

776
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:05,268
What will the int'l community say?

777
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,812
Who cares about that.

778
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:11,607
Like publicizing terrorism
works in Japan.

779
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,734
Yes, he's right.

780
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,654
Then, tell me.

781
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:22,159
Is Japan supposed to save face,

782
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:25,830
sacrificing 1 59 lives?

783
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,555
Reach a decision?

784
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,439
We'll release Keiichiro Mido.

785
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,154
Then, do it immediately.

786
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:03,117
We're processing it.

787
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,120
Put that on live TV broadcast.

788
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,748
What?

789
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:14,795
Lower the altitude to 1,700 ft.

790
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,548
1,700?

791
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:20,426
Yes, 1,700!

792
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:28,976
At that altitude
we can receive the TV waves.

793
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,980
Go that low?

794
01:18:15,649 --> 01:18:18,025
Minister, a word, please.

795
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:24,949
Whatever they may say here or abroad,

796
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,995
human life is of utmost priority.

797
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:32,081
Human life is

798
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:37,962
heavier than Earth. That's my belief.

799
01:18:49,474 --> 01:18:50,975
The broadcast's starting.

800
01:19:13,331 --> 01:19:15,583
A historical moment.

801
01:19:20,881 --> 01:19:22,965
Our Master Mido

802
01:19:29,639 --> 01:19:31,056
will be free.

803
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:37,730
If Mr. Mido is released, we can land.

804
01:19:39,024 --> 01:19:40,274
Nakagawa.

805
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,151
Change the world? I don't care.

806
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:44,320
Don't forget what you promised.

807
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,113
What d'you mean?

808
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,323
Shut up!

809
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:51,994
I don't care about Mido
or whatever. I only trust him.

810
01:19:52,370 --> 01:19:57,333
You're smart. If we have money,
go to college and get a good job.

811
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:00,211
Bro...you're mistaken.

812
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:04,089
I don't care about those things now.

813
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:12,181
Japan will be
the laughing stock in the world.

814
01:20:16,102 --> 01:20:19,772
Is that your wish? Mr. Mido...

815
01:20:20,023 --> 01:20:25,736
or rather journalist Yuichiro Asamiya,
ex-reporter or Howa Journal..

816
01:20:25,779 --> 01:20:26,904
What?

817
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:34,620
30 yrs. ago, you reported
the civil war in Colombia.

818
01:20:34,746 --> 01:20:36,789
I'm just a reporter, who idolized you.

819
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:40,334
That was long, long ago.

820
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:44,672
That's right. Long, long ago.

821
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,717
What are you now?

822
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:52,763
Blackmail politicians or their weaknesses.

823
01:20:53,431 --> 01:20:56,141
You're only a hoodlum.

824
01:20:57,561 --> 01:21:01,438
A world uninfluenced by money.

825
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,816
What is that? Tell me.

826
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:08,070
Wasn't finding that answer your job?

827
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:13,033
Did you give up?

828
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:20,958
In the near future, I'm going to
turn this country upside-down.

829
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,680
For 30 years, a bigwig politician

830
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:40,144
continued giving taxpayers' money

831
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:44,231
illegally to companies loyal to him.

832
01:21:45,609 --> 01:21:49,111
The one who laundered all this money

833
01:21:50,113 --> 01:21:52,323
was Keiichiro Mido.

834
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:58,120
Well, such a rumor did come up.

835
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:01,790
Were you pursuing that?

836
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,169
You should write it.

837
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,505
Are you kidding?

838
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,967
I value my life.

839
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:20,517
Then, tell me.
What is Mido planning to do?

840
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,897
Mido is about to be transported.

841
01:22:25,065 --> 01:22:27,900
For a glimpse o his face,

842
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:33,906
a multitude has begun to
gather around the transport route.

843
01:22:34,866 --> 01:22:38,661
Here he is. Mido has appeared.

844
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:41,622
Mido has left the police station.

845
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,208
Mido is wearing a white suit.

846
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:48,337
Escorted by several POs,
he looks solemn.

847
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:51,131
They are walking towards a car.

848
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:55,803
When released,
will Mido join the hijackers?

849
01:22:55,929 --> 01:23:00,599
But where the hijacked plane
will land is unknown.

850
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:18,617
Emergency dispatch!
Station men around Kamata Police St.

851
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,668
- What happened?
He's shot.

852
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,674
Mr. Mido...

853
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:38,595
Why..?

854
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,004
Why?

855
01:24:18,344 --> 01:24:20,512
Unrelated to you people,

856
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:23,640
something is moving.

857
01:24:26,686 --> 01:24:32,024
I don't know how important
that man is to you,

858
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:36,278
but is he worth doing all this?

859
01:24:39,532 --> 01:24:42,284
He said he can change the world.

860
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:46,288
He said he can.

861
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:51,502
Those who study and
work hard will be rewarded.

862
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:55,839
Said he will make such a world.

863
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:03,347
Is that your excuse for this?

864
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:07,518
Don't you think this world is wrong?

865
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,728
There's no time for that.

866
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,190
What is important now

867
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,068
is the life of all who's here.

868
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,071
Of course, yours, too.

869
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:23,534
The money.

870
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:26,787
What about the money?

871
01:25:30,875 --> 01:25:34,545
It was a mistake to bring you in.

872
01:25:36,714 --> 01:25:41,969
Compared to your brother,
you lack calmness.

873
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,349
Sorry about that.

874
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:49,226
That gun...

875
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:53,230
I'll keep it.

876
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,359
Won't allow impulsive shooting.

877
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,485
Big bro.

878
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:01,947
Don't.

879
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:03,490
Yusuke!

880
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:08,996
Big bro!

881
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:12,666
Don't move.

882
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,558
Are you a ghost?

883
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:45,699
If those boys did well,
I wasn't willing to step in.

884
01:26:47,952 --> 01:26:49,328
Big bro.

885
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:53,332
Big bro!

886
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,167
Sorry about it.

887
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:07,888
Where to?

888
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,181
Kimoto.

889
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:12,392
What if the purpose of this hijack

890
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:15,687
was not to release Mido,

891
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:18,565
but to murder him?

892
01:27:18,858 --> 01:27:19,858
How can..?

893
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:21,318
I told you

894
01:27:22,028 --> 01:27:25,864
something is moving
unrelated to you.

895
01:27:56,688 --> 01:27:58,814
Fuel tank will be empty.

896
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:08,365
Did you think you'd be safe
as long as you sat there?

897
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,389
Bunny!

898
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:46,111
The cargo room...

899
01:28:46,946 --> 01:28:48,613
The cargo room. Hurry.

900
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:47,798
Oh, no...The bomb...the bomb!

901
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:51,885
Cargo room! He's planning to escape.

902
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,850
Run out of fuel

903
01:30:00,019 --> 01:30:02,437
or the bomb explodes.

904
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:05,565
I wonder which is first.

905
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,947
Nakagawa.

906
01:30:12,532 --> 01:30:14,783
What's going on?

907
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:18,120
Don't come!

908
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,929
Bunny.

909
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:39,558
Where is it?

910
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:58,201
Did I switch it on?

911
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,337
If you let go, the thread may break,

912
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,048
or loosen the thread to

913
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,010
neutralize the safety.

914
01:31:15,511 --> 01:31:17,429
Either way, bang!

915
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,601
Or...

916
01:31:26,105 --> 01:31:28,899
I can push this button.

917
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,696
What do you..?

918
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:48,710
The parachute...

919
01:31:49,253 --> 01:31:51,630
That's why the low altitude.

920
01:31:53,424 --> 01:31:55,425
Escaping alone?

921
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:01,097
Sorry for being smart.

922
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:04,476
It works 100 km. away.

923
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:10,023
When I reach the ground,
I'll push the button.

924
01:32:40,888 --> 01:32:45,392
I wasn't told about
setting a bomb in the plane.

925
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,104
Nakagawa.

926
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,940
My plan from the start.

927
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:01,783
My dear blue clown,

928
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,121
job well done.

929
01:33:10,042 --> 01:33:11,501
Damn!

930
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:53,835
Bunny.

931
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,257
Hang on.

932
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:52,644
Thank you.

933
01:35:00,027 --> 01:35:05,240
Before he lands, we must
do something about this.

934
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:19,379
Mr. Mido told me
he won't take anybody's life.

935
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:27,679
That he'll make this a country
where life is valued.

936
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,557
If so,

937
01:35:37,314 --> 01:35:39,065
don't give up.

938
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:51,619
Is anyone an electronics expert?

939
01:35:52,037 --> 01:35:53,872
We need to defuse a bomb.

940
01:35:54,331 --> 01:35:56,958
We need someone,
who knows about electronics.

941
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:02,464
Is there anybody?

942
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:06,050
Things don't work that conveniently.

943
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:35,038
Don't, Bunny.
Please not the go-for-broke.

944
01:36:35,289 --> 01:36:36,623
But...

945
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:39,125
Not that,

946
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:50,887
I may not look it, but I have
a Master's degree in electronics.

947
01:36:52,431 --> 01:36:56,392
But with the recession,
no company wanted me.

948
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,479
So, I began an IT venture and succeeded.

949
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:04,692
I switched my life to money making.

950
01:37:05,110 --> 01:37:06,945
Satellite transmission.

951
01:37:07,112 --> 01:37:09,072
He said it's good for 1 00km.

952
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,617
Connects to antenna
for the satellite wave.

953
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:15,245
Some can be dummies.

954
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:16,579
Cut one of them?

955
01:37:17,623 --> 01:37:19,249
If you cut this...

956
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:21,334
Maybe.
Maybe?

957
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:25,046
There's no blade, so pull one off.

958
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:26,297
Pull it nicely.

959
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:28,341
No time. Do it.

960
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:39,519
Venture business is a gamble.

961
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,565
And I came out a winner.

962
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:46,985
I have just landed.

963
01:37:52,366 --> 01:37:53,575
Are you positive?

964
01:37:56,954 --> 01:37:58,329
Then, it'll be done as scheduled.

965
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:01,124
Yes.

966
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,377
Job well done.

967
01:38:13,345 --> 01:38:16,973
I hope my luck is still with me.

968
01:39:11,862 --> 01:39:13,112
Thank you.

969
01:39:16,992 --> 01:39:18,451
How long

970
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:22,830
will continue winning?

971
01:39:22,915 --> 01:39:24,457
Say...

972
01:39:25,459 --> 01:39:28,294
Must I keep holding this?

973
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:31,756
Yes, you must.

974
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:36,636
We count on you.

975
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:49,357
How many more minutes of fuel?

976
01:39:50,901 --> 01:39:56,781
1 0 min. We must take
the shortest route and land.

977
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:59,659
Can you hear me?

978
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:02,161
Bunny...

979
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:03,579
How's Capt. Kano?

980
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:08,501
He's wounded and cannot pilot.
Co-pilot is unconscious.

981
01:40:10,504 --> 01:40:12,463
I know there is no time.

982
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,677
I will land this plane.

983
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:20,972
Oh, c'mon.

984
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,348
That's reckless.

985
01:40:22,516 --> 01:40:25,977
Bunny, isn't there
anyone more appropriate?

986
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:29,564
If there is, why am I here?

987
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:34,193
What're going to do?

988
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:36,446
Bunny,

989
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:41,159
you kept something
very important from me.

990
01:40:43,328 --> 01:40:44,871
What could that be?

991
01:40:47,124 --> 01:40:51,127
Hurry. What am I to do?

992
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,628
Well, what?

993
01:40:54,631 --> 01:40:56,090
Chief!

994
01:40:58,010 --> 01:40:59,594
Bunny,

995
01:41:00,512 --> 01:41:04,307
you must land the place safely.

996
01:41:08,854 --> 01:41:10,438
I will

997
01:41:11,523 --> 01:41:13,733
land this plane.

998
01:41:15,527 --> 01:41:17,487
It's my duty.

999
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:25,828
Bunny.

1000
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:28,873
Just for basic information.

1001
01:41:29,124 --> 01:41:34,754
Have you piloted any small aircraft?
Like a Cessna, for example?

1002
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,130
No.

1003
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:38,841
Good.

1004
01:41:40,552 --> 01:41:46,682
That way you won't
have any preconception.

1005
01:41:47,434 --> 01:41:50,812
Only, you must listen carefully

1006
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:53,397
to every word I say to you, and

1007
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:56,359
precisely follow my directions,

1008
01:41:57,236 --> 01:41:58,402
Am I clear?

1009
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:01,739
Crystal clear.

1010
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:06,035
First of all, we will be able to

1011
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:10,331
guide that plane by radar.

1012
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:15,920
We can navigate
the plane to the airport.

1013
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:22,260
so don't touch any instruments,
until I tell you to.

1014
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:26,931
That'll certainly be fine with me.

1015
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:31,269
In 3 min. you should see
the runway in front of you.

1016
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:33,896
Look carefully for it.

1017
01:42:38,193 --> 01:42:40,945
The fuel is almost gone.

1018
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:44,574
It's a one-shot deal.

1019
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:47,952
Okay.

1020
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:57,295
About the fuel...

1021
01:42:58,797 --> 01:43:00,423
Will it last? I...

1022
01:43:01,717 --> 01:43:06,262
Well? Are you beginning
to see the runway?

1023
01:43:17,983 --> 01:43:19,150
I see it.

1024
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:26,741
Well, then. Let's begin.

1025
01:43:36,835 --> 01:43:41,297
First, on the right of
the seat you're sitting in

1026
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,842
there are 2 white levers.

1027
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:46,802
The throttle levers.

1028
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:50,723
Slowly pull them to your side.

1029
01:43:51,099 --> 01:43:54,310
Pull until the numbers on the monitor

1030
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:58,564
in front of you becomes 70.

1031
01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:08,115
You're doing fine.

1032
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:09,742
Keep it there.

1033
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:16,040
Next, the white lever next to them.

1034
01:44:18,293 --> 01:44:19,961
Not that.

1035
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:23,005
On the right side.

1036
01:44:23,715 --> 01:44:25,091
The flap.

1037
01:44:27,469 --> 01:44:29,095
This one, right?

1038
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:31,347
How many?

1039
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:32,807
Five.

1040
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:33,891
Okay.

1041
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:46,237
Now, we lower the nosewheel.

1042
01:44:47,864 --> 01:44:50,241
The wheel-shaped lever in front.

1043
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,994
Pull and lower it.

1044
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:55,830
The light will turn green.

1045
01:45:00,919 --> 01:45:02,920
It's still red.

1046
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,089
Try once more.

1047
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:06,173
Yes,

1048
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,846
Still red. No change.

1049
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,014
Once more.

1050
01:45:16,518 --> 01:45:18,352
It changed to green.

1051
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,740
This time,

1052
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:36,162
Turn the flap to 25.

1053
01:45:41,668 --> 01:45:44,128
What do I do next?

1054
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:46,672
Captain?

1055
01:45:47,299 --> 01:45:48,424
Captain!

1056
01:45:49,801 --> 01:45:52,428
Captain! Captain!

1057
01:45:52,554 --> 01:45:55,139
I'll take over from here.

1058
01:45:56,558 --> 01:46:00,227
Push the control stick slowly forward

1059
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:02,063
to lower the altitude.

1060
01:46:02,689 --> 01:46:07,318
Lower the throttle
until the numbers become 60.

1061
01:46:08,403 --> 01:46:12,907
There's the altitude gage
before the control stick.

1062
01:46:13,075 --> 01:46:17,620
Looking at that, adjust it to 1,000 ft.

1063
01:46:28,507 --> 01:46:31,008
Lower your head.

1064
01:46:52,114 --> 01:46:53,322
Darling.

1065
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,617
What are you doing?

1066
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,744
Don't come. Don't come here.

1067
01:48:30,629 --> 01:48:36,759
Please calm yourself.

1068
01:49:03,662 --> 01:49:07,039
We're saved.

1069
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:10,501
Thanks you, muscle man.

1070
01:49:19,469 --> 01:49:23,055
Please watch your step.

1071
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:04,555
Apprehended Yusuke Kimoto.

1072
01:50:09,269 --> 01:50:10,936
Yuka.

1073
01:50:11,563 --> 01:50:13,397
I'm a Kyushu woman.

1074
01:50:13,773 --> 01:50:16,900
I won't let my husband suffer.

1075
01:50:18,862 --> 01:50:21,989
C'mon. Hold it steady.

1076
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,459
I'm yours forever.

1077
01:51:07,744 --> 01:51:09,119
Please.

1078
01:52:50,722 --> 01:52:51,930
Ah...

1079
01:52:56,019 --> 01:52:57,936
Thank you very much.

1080
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:05,986
She really did well.

1081
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:25,297
Bunny!

1082
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:33,972
Human life is heavier than Earth.

1083
01:53:35,308 --> 01:53:38,977
Minister Kurihara, your words move me.

1084
01:53:40,688 --> 01:53:42,022
It's over now.

1085
01:53:42,732 --> 01:53:47,528
Yes, it's over.

1086
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,119
I can't

1087
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:04,628
end it like this.

1088
01:54:09,217 --> 01:54:11,510
Sister!

1089
01:54:11,803 --> 01:54:13,220
Make way!

1090
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:30,779
You asked for me?

1091
01:54:31,406 --> 01:54:36,034
I am Kawano. I used to be
METI Minister's secretary.

1092
01:54:36,494 --> 01:54:37,452
Yes, and...

1093
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,205
I must hold a press conference.

1094
01:54:40,373 --> 01:54:44,418
Protect me until that time.

1095
01:54:46,337 --> 01:54:50,215
That's METI Minister
Kurihara's ex-secretary.

1096
01:54:50,925 --> 01:54:54,303
Kurihara will be the next premier.

1097
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:58,473
Probably wanted to sever the dark ties.

1098
01:54:58,850 --> 01:55:03,729
Kurihara will have
Mido released and then killed.

1099
01:55:03,855 --> 01:55:06,023
Hijack was the tool.

1100
01:55:06,107 --> 01:55:10,986
At the same time,
to silence that ex-secretary,

1101
01:55:11,195 --> 01:55:16,325
he intends to blow up the plane
with all 160 on board.

1102
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:18,410
What a...

1103
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:22,706
Those clinging to power,
disregard human life.

1104
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,666
The ones used were...

1105
01:55:25,126 --> 01:55:31,256
Innocent young men.
Absurd and unforgiveable.

1106
01:55:32,717 --> 01:55:36,637
You're righteous for your age.

1107
01:55:41,601 --> 01:55:43,060
It's absolutely unforgiveable.

1108
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:47,606
There's a short run now.

1109
01:55:47,982 --> 01:55:50,192
Sister.

1110
01:55:58,409 --> 01:55:59,910
Cardiac arrest.

1111
01:56:02,038 --> 01:56:03,455
Sister.

1112
01:56:30,525 --> 01:56:32,943
Minister Kurihara.

1113
01:56:34,821 --> 01:56:37,823
In exchange for Reiko's life

1114
01:56:39,117 --> 01:56:41,410
the bad guys were caught.

1115
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:49,876
How heavy is the 159 lives
Reiko saved,

1116
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:52,754
staking her life,

1117
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:58,051
really isn't my concern.

1118
01:57:00,596 --> 01:57:05,225
For me, the fact that Reiko is gone

1119
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:08,854
cannot be compared to Earth.

1120
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:14,109
It lost the existence
of the universe itself.

1121
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:19,364
But before that,

1122
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:23,952
does the universe have
meaning in its existence?

1123
01:58:15,046 --> 01:58:18,840
What will you dream about next?

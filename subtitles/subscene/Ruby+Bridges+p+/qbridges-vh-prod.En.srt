1
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,775
A little longer.

2
00:03:52,765 --> 00:04:01,730
QUEMAR LAS NAVES

3
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,001
-Did you find Sebastian?
-No! There's no way through!

4
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,884
Touch him and l'll have
your legs broken!

5
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,891
You're new, right?

6
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:12,877
Hey! Hey!
What's going on?

7
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,878
Nothing, Father.
Good morning.

8
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,982
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

9
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,112
Mom? Your pill.

10
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,190
lt's time.

11
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:48,198
Do you like it, Mom?

12
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,169
lt looks better on you
than it did on me.

13
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,390
Cherries.

14
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,188
lf you don't find cherries
buy raspberries...

15
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,161
...if not, strawberries,
but the ones in a basket.

16
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,122
Then, those flavored
vitamins for Sebastian...

17
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,226
...and cod oil.

18
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,263
Buy beef liver
and lots of onions.

19
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,143
Sebastian doesn't like liver.

20
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,278
Neither onions
but he's very weak.

21
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:29,142
And for your mom?

22
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,151
The usual.

23
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:36,246
And some chalk for the ants.

24
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,158
That's Efrain.
l'll get it.

25
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,364
She doesn't want that.

26
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:48,301
l know, but with a nurse at hand
l'll be at ease.

27
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,292
At least one shift,
don't be stubborn.

28
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,505
You don't get to decide.
She already said no.

29
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,439
Helena, your mother
is very weak.

30
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:57,271
-Chayo can't do everything.
-Chayo?

31
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,334
What's Chayo got to do
with anything?

32
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,346
Who takes care of my mom?
l do.

33
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,415
Because you... one thing
is to come and give orders...

34
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,320
...1 5 minutes every day,
Monday through Friday...

35
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,412
...and another is to stay.

36
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,486
Don't even think
that's an invitation.

37
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,223
You have your life.

38
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:24,258
-Smoking is...
-You are not my father.

39
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,496
You're the doctor.

40
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,274
Do you have everything?

41
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,309
Those vials for the pain
are almost out.

42
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:39,278
Morphine. l'll send them over.
Anything else?

43
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:43,284
Nothing.
Well, the usual.

44
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,556
Money.

45
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,551
l'll write you a check.

46
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,586
You look very pretty
with that dress.

47
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,405
Let's see.

48
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,509
Helena is becoming
as stubborn as you.

49
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,496
How long has it been
since you showered?

50
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,670
Aren't you going
to go see mom?

51
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,476
Don't go in.

52
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,744
She's with you-know-who.

53
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,753
Take a bath, pig.

54
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,546
-What?
-''And yet, it moves''.

55
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,713
Oh, allow me.

56
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,620
Oh, Javier,
you didn't understand.

57
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,594
l'll explain later.

58
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,734
Javier...

59
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,837
You're so strong!

60
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,784
Who said you could sit here?

61
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:31,680
Make me move.

62
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:35,655
Where are you going?
This guy is moving!

63
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,890
Okay, hormones!
Sit down!

64
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,891
Sit down.

65
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:03,955
Helena.

66
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,742
The shot, Sebastian.

67
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,738
The shot.

68
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:33,752
Leave it.

69
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:34,843
You don't know how.

70
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,785
Where are you going?

71
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:40,859
Learn.

72
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,906
<i>I had no voic</i>e.

And suddenly,
all the lights came on...

77
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:46,953
...and l saw thousands
and thousands...

78
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,054
...and thousands of people
applauding...

79
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,158
...applauding me.

80
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:01,940
And then...

81
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,068
And then what?

82
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,107
She fell asleep.

Just go out already!

Don't hug her like

Yes, but don't yell at me.

You're yelling.

All right.
l'll bring him over.

143
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,986
What did Helena say?

144
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,033
Oh, boy, boy.

145
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,140
Seven.

There.
They'll come off now.

147
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,186
He shoved me!
Did you see?

148
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,122
l take care of him
and he hits me!

149
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,234
lt's only his leg.
He'll be all right.

150
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,065
He can die for all l care.

151
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,138
''lt's not that, dumb girl''.

152
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,140
Don't talk to me
like l'm a girl.

153
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,074
lt's friendly talk, dumb girl.

154
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,108
Where were you
when he fell?

155
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,212
ln the courtyard.

156
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:36,077
He was up a wall.

157
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,111
Sebastian has vertigo.

158
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:40,185
Yeah, but he wasn't
up there alone.

159
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,187
-He was with a guy.
-What guy?

160
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,088
Some idiot.
He shoved him.

161
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,251
He didn't shove me.
l jumped.

162
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,352
You jumped?

163
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,263
You?

164
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:55,132
Yes.
l jumped.

165
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,366
My mom's up.

166
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,217
Chayo!
There's nothing to clean up!

167
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,391
What do you want to clean?
Everything's clean!

168
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,401
Chayo!
Everything's in order.

169
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:10,542
Do your homework or you'll
never finish grade school.

170
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,510
-Junior high.
-That's what l meant.

171
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,346
l'm finished.

172
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,337
Then why don't you take
the day off?

173
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,378
Why don't you go skiing?

174
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,486
What a bad attitude!

175
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,283
See why l don't study?

176
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,455
Every graduate becomes
a bitter hag!

177
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,600
Look what l found.

178
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,470
''Canada, eight days.
Niagara, Toronto...

179
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,372
...Ottawa, Quebec
and Montreal...

180
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,340
...for only US$800.''

181
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,435
This is great.

182
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,342
l hate that you're always
in my room.

183
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,352
All l care about your room
is the computer, not you.

184
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,655
Then take it
as well as your wall.

185
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,557
Put all your trips
in your room.

186
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,354
They're not my trips!

187
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,424
They're our trips.

188
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,594
We're going together, cripple.

189
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,457
Goodbye, Russia.

190
00:26:13,538 --> 00:26:17,099
Now explain me why.
Chelita loved you!

191
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,405
She's a great woman!

192
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:22,538
lntelligent, educated,
sensible, funny...

193
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,583
Her children live in Houston.

194
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,574
You didn't even have
that problem!

195
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:30,415
l'm not saying you should
remarry or anything.

196
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,418
l know Blondie,
God rest her soul...

197
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,683
...was one-of-a-kind.

198
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,688
Do you remember
your aunt Blondie, honey?

199
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,500
Wasn't she some woman?

200
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,491
There are no women
like that anymore.

201
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,537
l'm telling you, honey,
so you can start thinking...

202
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,540
...about the woman
you'll bring over.

203
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,668
By the way,
do you have a girlfriend yet?

204
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:54,738
When do you find the time?

205
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,515
You see, Efrain?
He's just like you!

206
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,484
Shacked up in that
singer's house day and night!

207
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,652
How awful.

208
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,488
-Pour some for me.
-Ma'am!

209
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:06,486
lt's ready!

210
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:10,491
That one always yells.
Let's go have lunch.

211
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,592
Bring the flowers, honey.

212
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,701
You're lsmael's uncle
and godfather...

213
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,635
...don't screw him up.

214
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,665
The singer's children are
growing up like savages.

215
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,537
Arm up.

216
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:31,708
Now the other one.

217
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,626
l can do it.

218
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,717
What else?

219
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,685
They say his mom
was a prostitute.

220
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,686
But a real prostitute.

221
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,925
ln fact, she worked
in Mazatlan.

222
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,996
She died later
due to alcohol...

223
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,032
...or she caught syphilis
or something...

224
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,897
...and they came to live here.

225
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:59,736
His father has a run-down bar
at the market.

226
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,741
Well, no one really knows
if he's his father.

227
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:06,869
But he was born there...
...at the ocean.

228
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:07,877
At the ocean?

229
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,743
He was born in
a damn public hospital.

230
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,752
Why are you so interested?

231
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,066
This one?

232
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,894
Pink is for secretaries...

233
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:35,801
...and president's wives.

234
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,939
lt doesn't go with us.

235
00:29:39,978 --> 00:29:40,945
This one?

236
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,922
You're strong like me.

237
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,855
That's why you have
to take care of your brother.

238
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:39,937
''ldleness is the mother
of all vice.'' Alvarado Diaz.

239
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,073
Cut your hair! l've told you,
you look like a girl!

240
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,938
Go to the office.
See if you can help.

241
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,205
You can use
your hands, right?

242
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,127
To be on grant
isn't only a privilege.

243
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,103
To be on grant
is a responsibility.

244
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,032
Next time you take off
during class...

245
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,135
...you won't even have
to come talk to me.

246
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,041
Be warned.

247
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,024
What happened to you?

248
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:41,064
Oh, right.
Get better soon.

249
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,301
Damn unfair high-school.

250
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,202
Why do you go here?

251
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,236
Because l promised my mom.

252
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,220
What did you do?

253
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,290
Nothing. Father Chacon
sent me here to help.

254
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,258
Do you always do
what you're told?

255
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,293
-You're always scared, right?
-No.

256
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:13,330
Of course you are. Because
of you, we almost got caught.

257
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,128
l told you to jump
and you froze.

258
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,131
-But l jumped.
-After l pushed you.

259
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,278
Hey, do you want
to take off?

260
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,280
Right now?

261
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,146
You see?
You're scared.

262
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,326
Juan!

263
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,234
Juan!

264
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,270
Bring me a damp cloth
and clean sheets.

265
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:29,364
She wet herself.

266
00:33:32,543 --> 00:33:35,410
She's filthy.
You can cry later.

267
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,569
Fifty pesos.

268
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,345
l'm talking to you.

269
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,441
Yes, you do have them.

270
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,447
Who invited...?

271
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,625
Please go. Go.

272
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,366
What now?

273
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,626
Why are you here?
Didn't you go to school?

274
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,398
-l did.
-Two rum and cokes.

275
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,404
Go cry at home.

276
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:50,414
<i>You hav</i>e <i>such pr</i>e<i>tty</i> e<i>y</i>e<i>s.</i>

277
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:55,415
<i>Such bushy</i> e<i>y</i>e<i>brows.</i>

278
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,639
Where's your lD, kid?

279
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,507
l'm with him.

280
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:32,663
Sit down, dude.

281
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,634
He wasn't in last period.
l thought he came here.

282
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,640
All you have to do
is take and bring him.

283
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,766
How did you lose him?

284
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,640
When did my uncle leave?

285
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,746
-Hours ago.
-What did he say?

286
00:35:48,746 --> 00:35:50,680
What do you think,
dumb girl?

287
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,613
Don't call me ''girl'' again.

288
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,553
l'm the only idiot
locked up here.

289
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,556
l want to go to the movies.

290
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:01,859
So, let's go.

291
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,554
Don't you get it?

292
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:05,721
l can't go out.

293
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,900
-Chayo can stay.
-Chayo doesn't know.

294
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,636
She's taken care
of your mom for years!

295
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,870
lf you don't go out
it's your decision.

296
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,735
Exactly!
l don't want to.

297
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:18,609
Go.

298
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:27,774
lf you put honey,
more will come.

299
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,617
lt's poisoned honey.

300
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,848
l'll take these.
What table?

301
00:36:57,848 --> 00:36:59,951
-One.
-Are you hungry?

302
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,885
-Yeah.
-There's roasted chicken.

303
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,728
ls that your dad?

304
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:11,786
What's it to you?

305
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,834
You really broke
a sweat now, huh?

306
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,869
Want a beer?

307
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:26,944
Cheers.

308
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,842
lt looks beautiful, huh?

309
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:06,972
The city.

310
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,977
From a distance.

311
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,858
l'm getting the hell out
of here as soon as l can.

312
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:15,826
-Where to?
-The ocean.

313
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,094
To Mazatlan.
That's where l'm from.

314
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,133
-l've never been there.
-To Mazatlan?

315
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,100
To the ocean.

316
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:25,902
Really?

317
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,875
See those damn hills?

318
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,876
-Yeah.
-Close your eyes.

319
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,017
Close them up.

320
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:46,890
Now imagine they're
made of water...

321
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,957
...instead of soil.
They fall over you.

322
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:53,986
Open them.

323
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:15,974
No Russians.

324
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:28,959
Oh, Mom.
Again?

325
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:42,006
''l wish l could stop you.
l go on bitterly...

326
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,044
...until both of us have died.

327
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,277
l don't care
what you go through.

328
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,046
Your feelings are
indifferent to me...''

329
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,287
Leave him alone.

330
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:02,154
Go on.

331
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:12,070
''Why don't they suffer?
l do suffer.''

332
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:55,181
''Without a doubt, you
are possessed by the devil...

333
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,153
...said he with ferocity,
if you talk to me like this...

334
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,416
...when you are dying.

335
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,359
Don't you understand
that your words...

336
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:04,295
...will be burned
into my memory...

337
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,388
...like hot iron and
that l'll remember them...

338
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,329
...even when
you cease to exist?

339
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:11,469
lsn't it enough for
your diabolic selfishness...

340
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,472
...to think that when
you rest in peace...

341
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:18,340
...l will writhe from
the tortures of Hell?

342
00:41:19,276 --> 00:41:24,213
l will not rest in peace,
said Catalina pitifully.''

343
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:03,377
''Next to whom he stood,
quietly, becoming...''

344
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,548
The white one.
The white linen.

345
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,722
Don't let anyone touch me...

346
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:24,561
...only you.

347
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,560
You wash my face...

348
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,666
...and dress me
in my white dress.

349
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:35,628
l don't want anyone
from here to come.

350
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,610
We aren't from here.

351
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:44,839
That's the one.

352
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,746
Where's your brother?

353
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:00,627
Answer me!
Who were you with?

354
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,633
-What do you care?
-l do care!

355
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,929
l'm the one who's
locked up here...

356
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:07,838
...taking care of everything!
You, mom, the house...

357
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,973
...and who knows
what you're up to!

358
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,770
What are you up to?

359
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,912
l'm asking you a question
Why don't you answer?

360
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:17,848
Don't you have anything
else to do but nag at me?

361
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,816
l'm not!
l'm taking care of you!

362
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,786
lf it wasn't for me,
the house would fall on you!

363
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,788
Let it fall!
Let it all go to hell!

364
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,724
-l don't care!
-Yeah, l know!

365
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,954
All you care about
is your stupid drawings!

366
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,690
Efrain came today.

367
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,695
Mom is very sick.

368
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:39,961
Did you hear me?

369
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,764
-Did you hear me?
-Helena, don't yell.

370
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:45,976
You'll wake your mom.

371
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,809
Shut up! l'll yell if l want to!
lt's my house!

372
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:52,007
lf you don't like it, pack your
shit and go back to your ranch!

373
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:07,021
Don't look at me like that.
l'm tired.

374
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,918
l couldn't find him,
but we should go.

375
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:03,086
-He must've gone with Scarface.
-Did you see him?

376
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:05,088
No. But they're
very friendly now.

377
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,886
Shut up.
l'll see you.

378
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:08,992
Aren't you going?

379
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,960
''lf my girl doesn't go,
l won't go.''

380
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,154
-What did you say, idiot?
-Nothing. Nothing.

381
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:18,001
What's up? Hey!

382
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,001
-How did you get that?
-What's it to you?

383
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,009
There.

384
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,277
There.
Did you bring it?

385
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:18,285
Okay. Walk.

386
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:33,076
Wait!

387
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,089
Come on, cripple!

388
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,119
l can't run so fast!

389
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,165
Helena.

390
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,378
Call Efrain!

391
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,505
Mom.

392
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:12,475
Mom.

393
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,298
Helena?

394
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:42,572
Helena?

395
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,383
Chayo?

396
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:49,699
-Answer me.
-Whatever you say.

397
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,600
No, not whatever l say.

398
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,764
Why do l always have
to decide on my own?

399
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,675
Do we throw it all away?

400
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,704
l don't know.
Whatever you want.

401
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,853
Do we throw it all away?

402
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,823
Chayo?
Chayo, come here.

403
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:26,800
l'm giving away all
my mother's things.

404
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,771
l need you to help me.

405
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,006
Want me to tell you
how l got my scar?

406
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,888
My mom was carrying me.

407
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,981
She was happily dancing
with me...

408
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,890
...and l let go of her.

409
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,860
When l fell,
l hit the edge of the stair.

410
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,899
They're my mom's things.
l don't want them to take it.

411
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:16,036
Didn't you hear me?!

412
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,106
Give everything back!

413
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:33,189
<i>And Chayo said nothing?</i>

414
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,057
<i>Sh</i>e <i>just I</i>e<i>ft?</i>

415
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,131
Have you thought
about what we discussed?

416
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:49,145
lf you sell the house
you could save a lot.

417
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,114
You wouldn't spend
living with me.

418
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:53,048
l'd take care of everything.

419
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,211
We're going to rent rooms.

420
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,055
l put out an ad.
l'm studying English...

421
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,182
...while Sebastian finishes
the school year.

422
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,122
We don't want to leave.

423
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:06,129
Helena, your mother is gone.

424
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:08,098
We can manage alone.

425
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:09,190
lt's our house.

426
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,201
Sebastian?

427
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,309
Sebastian wants
to stay as well.

428
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,311
You'd be more comfortable
at my place.

429
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,278
No.

430
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,061
We'll be fine.

431
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:46,269
On August 16th 1 51 9...

432
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,205
...Hernan Cortes begins
his journey to Mexico...

433
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:51,230
...joined by his allies,
the Totonacas...

434
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,309
...who hate the emperor,
Montezuma.

435
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:56,107
But, as he has to protect
the port of Veracruz...

436
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,238
...in case Diego Velázquez
attacks from Cuba...

437
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,373
...he decides to leave
a battalion there.

438
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:04,086
The Spaniards are scared
and want to return home...

439
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,356
...so Cortes has all
the boats burned down.

440
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:07,323
Ships.

441
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,156
Why does he have
all the ships burned?

442
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,391
So no one can go back
until they conquer Mexico.

443
00:57:17,333 --> 00:57:18,300
Exactly.

444
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,272
Okay, you've given me
the historical context...

445
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,365
...of the novel,
but we're talking about...

446
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,341
...the metaphorical figures.

447
00:57:28,244 --> 00:57:31,304
What does one mean when you say:
''Burn the ships''?

448
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:41,414
lt means that in order
to leave...

449
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:45,328
...you have to let go
of what's left behind...

450
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,319
...so you can't go back...

451
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,298
...even if you're scared.

452
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:01,335
What are you thinking?

453
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:03,212
About mom.

454
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,483
lt's weird that she never
left this place...

455
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,314
...not even on holiday.

456
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,318
We never went to the ocean.

457
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,284
Of course we did.

458
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:15,457
You were very little,
that's why you don't remember.

459
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:16,492
Really?

460
00:58:19,462 --> 00:58:22,260
l got a terrible
skin infection.

461
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,491
There are some pictures
around here.

462
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,366
-Where?
-l'm not finished yet!

463
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,274
Ready.
So what?

464
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:39,348
No.

465
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,484
Stop acting like a child
and get dressed!

466
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,485
l said no.

467
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,388
-We need the money!
-Then sell the house!

468
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,582
We talked about it
and decided...!

469
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:49,416
''We'' decided?
You decided!

470
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,528
Okay.
Okay.

471
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,362
But tell me, truthfully.

472
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,335
Do you want us to leave?

473
00:59:05,508 --> 00:59:07,442
Too late.
lt's her.

474
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,647
As of now you can't go
around the house naked.

475
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,410
You'll scare her.

476
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,485
-Where are you living?
-ln a board room.

477
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,552
lt's cool, but it's awful.
l want to move.

478
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:27,360
Okay, we get groceries
once a week.

479
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,566
We can divide
the expense later.

480
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,568
Do you know how to cook?

481
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,592
Yeah, l love it!

482
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:35,403
Great because l don't cook.

483
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:41,477
Hello.

484
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,414
-Do you live here alone?
-Yeah.

485
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,519
l don't know.
My parents...

486
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,419
Shall l show you your room?

487
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,493
Can l put
my ping-pong table here?

488
00:59:57,493 --> 00:59:59,562
-Your what?
-l love ping-pong.

489
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:00,722
l have the table
and everything.

490
01:00:01,464 --> 01:00:03,432
lt was my sweet sixteen
birthday present.

491
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,568
l couldn't open it
at the board room...

492
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,468
...but there's room here.

493
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:10,563
l'll tell them to send it over.
lt's cool, isn't it?

494
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,707
All right.

495
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:17,604
You should stop smoking.
Tobacco dries the skin.

496
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,482
Thank you for your concern.
l'll bear it in mind.

497
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:25,521
Hey, if you run into
my brother again...

498
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:27,557
...don't even try
to talk to him.

499
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:31,493
He's an enemy of society.
He's sick.

500
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,755
l'll show you your room.

501
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,740
lt's cool, isn't it?

502
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:56,751
-Can you play?
-No.

503
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:58,554
l'm a champ.

504
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:01,681
l can teach you.

505
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,727
Okay.

506
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,629
Won't it hurt you?

507
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:13,769
Why?

508
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:15,872
Because of your health.

509
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:16,839
Oh!

510
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:20,842
Let me give you some advice.

511
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:23,646
Don't believe anything
Helena tells you.

512
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:24,805
She's got problems.

513
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:29,613
Okay, but l play lefty
to give you the upper hand.

514
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,825
l'm sorry. The champ
comes out with the left.

515
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,695
One, zero to me.

516
01:01:42,665 --> 01:01:44,724
Two, zero. Bend down a little
to see it.

517
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:47,836
Three, zero.

518
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,736
That one was hard.
Do your best.

519
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:47,180
-So he didn't sleep here?
-l said he didn't.

520
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,142
-l'll call my uncle.
-No!

521
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:53,289
l told you to come and help me
not so you'd gossip to Efrain.

522
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,052
lf you say a word...

523
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:57,319
...you can never set foot
here again for treason.

524
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,058
Let's go look for him
in your car.

525
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:01,197
Something must've
happened to him.

526
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:03,232
-Hey...
-Don't say anything, Aurora!

527
01:05:03,232 --> 01:05:05,063
l saw him leave.

528
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:09,171
-Hello. l'm Aurora.
-Yeah. When did you see him?

529
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,207
Last night. A friend of his
came to pick him up.

530
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,108
-They left together.
-A friend? Who was he?

531
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,345
l don't know.
lt was really dark.

532
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:18,176
l didn't see him.
l couldn't sleep.

533
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,150
Since l was a girl,
l've had trouble breathing.

534
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:22,242
Shut up, Aurora!

535
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:24,353
Come on.

536
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,089
lt was a pleasure.

537
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,271
What are you doing
in my room?

538
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,278
Take them.

539
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:26,405
lf you're man enough,
come take them.

540
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:29,350
You're a fag, aren't you?

541
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:31,420
Take them!

542
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:38,293
His fag friend's drawings.

543
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:40,392
Don't you dare, bitch.

544
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,383
Fag!

545
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:03,450
Fag!

546
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,485
Get away!
Let go!

547
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,429
Let me go, idiot!
Get away!

548
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,353
Helena, can l come in?

549
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:45,427
l've got some ice
for your face.

550
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,453
Tell Sebastian
to bring them in.

551
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:48,757
Dude.

552
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,529
-Your mother was a prostitute.
-What, pig?

553
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:54,723
Your mother was
a prostitute!

554
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:56,588
Your mother was...!

555
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:12,542
<i>BIood! BIood!</i>

556
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,778
Blood! Blood!

557
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:39,740
Come on!
Got anymore jokes?!

558
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:42,878
Let go of me!

559
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,883
Can't you see this guy
is insane?!

560
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,923
You see?!
Dario, go get Father Miguel!

561
01:10:08,671 --> 01:10:09,638
Move!

562
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:20,949
Wait, Juan!

563
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:26,755
-What will we do?
-Nothing!

564
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:28,723
You and l aren't
doing anything.

565
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:31,758
l'm getting the first bus
out of this damn town.

566
01:10:32,861 --> 01:10:33,828
Me, too.

567
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:46,967
Tell them to let him go.

568
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:50,946
Tell them!

569
01:10:57,953 --> 01:11:00,022
This guy is sick!
Where are you going?

570
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,922
He's leaving.
So am l.

571
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:03,925
Where?

572
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,928
Why do you want to know?

573
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:06,986
To have us beaten up?

574
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:10,854
l'll go with you.

575
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:16,871
You can't.

576
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,806
You see?
You'll never do it.

577
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,922
-Didn't l tell you to go away?!
-l can't, sir! Get in the car!

578
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:37,092
l can do whatever l want
and go wherever l want!

579
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:39,925
-Get the hell away!
-l'm calling your mother!

580
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,106
Sebastian?

581
01:11:59,948 --> 01:12:01,183
What's going on?
What's wrong?

582
01:12:01,183 --> 01:12:03,185
l need money.
Give me money.

583
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,016
-What for?
-l have to go.

584
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:07,923
-How much do you have?
-Three thousand. What for?

585
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:09,958
-Give them to me!
-Who are you leaving with?

586
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:11,093
First you have to explain!

587
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,926
-l don't have time.
-You won't get anything.

588
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,928
Sebastian, wait!

589
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:21,970
Wait!

590
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:29,972
Aurora, open the door.

591
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:31,137
Open the door, Aurora!

592
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,152
Sebastian!

593
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:49,958
-Did you give him money?
-l swear l didn't. He took it.

594
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,105
He'll come back.

595
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,223
BUS STATlON

596
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,142
What's up?

597
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,313
l can't.

598
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:24,383
Go to hell!

599
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:11,526
What is this?

600
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:16,720
Nothing.

601
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,634
Your room is very cold
and winter's almost here.

602
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,601
We're better off here.

603
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:36,652
lf she finds out l've been
talking to you she'll kill me.

604
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,720
But she's really
starting to scare me.

605
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:41,657
First, she put all
of Sebastian's things...

606
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:44,626
...in her room.
Then, even the bed.

607
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,763
l had to help her
and l even told her...

608
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,560
...that l had a hernia.

609
01:17:49,831 --> 01:17:52,561
They've been locked in
for three days.

610
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:54,635
When l say locked in,
l mean it.

611
01:18:01,777 --> 01:18:02,744
Helena?

612
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,646
Helena, open up.
We want to see Sebastian!

613
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,757
We're not to blame
for anything.

614
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:29,771
l am.

615
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:35,943
lsmael!

616
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:40,780
lsmael, would you like
to play a little ping-pong?

617
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:33,000
<i>You'r</i>e <i>pIaying r</i>e<i>aIIy w</i>e<i>II.</i>

618
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:02,892
Stop it with your stupid ball!

619
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,930
Why don't they leave?

620
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,933
<i>On</i>e <i>day, I'II I</i>e<i>av</i>e...

621
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,976
<i>...and I won't com</i>e <i>back</i>
e<i>v</i>e<i>r again.</i>

622
01:20:50,212 --> 01:20:53,010
<i>I know I hav</i>e <i>to carry on...</i>

623
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:57,014
<i>...with my Iif</i>e <i>som</i>e<i>wh</i>e<i>r</i>e e<i>Is</i>e.

624
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,988
Can you stop
that damn song?

625
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,252
Can you make something
for lunch, Aurora?

626
01:21:43,331 --> 01:21:45,162
Let's go see a movie.

627
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,285
l haven't heard from him,
l told you before.

628
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,194
He won't call.

629
01:22:14,396 --> 01:22:16,364
He stole from me
in order to leave.

630
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,264
He'd be stupid to call me.

631
01:22:25,206 --> 01:22:26,366
When his mother died...

632
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:30,108
...his aunts wanted
to take him to Mazatlan.

633
01:22:30,412 --> 01:22:34,143
He chose to stay.
l don't know why.

634
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:38,150
Maybe he got very
attached to me.

635
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:46,157
He never said anything.

636
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:50,254
The opposite of his mother
who'd never stop talking.

637
01:23:01,443 --> 01:23:03,343
Don't you have a girlfriend?

638
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:22,387
l'm really confused.

639
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:27,359
But l'm not wrong.
They are screwed up.

640
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,496
What? Do you think
this is normal?

641
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:35,398
lt's not normal.

642
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,404
Why do you let them
treat you like that?

643
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,284
l'm sorry.
l'm not mad at you.

644
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,520
You're really nice
to everyone.

645
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:50,458
ln fact, you're too nice.

646
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:56,564
lt's Helena!

647
01:23:57,432 --> 01:23:58,500
She heard us!

648
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,331
She was spying on us!

649
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,570
She'll kill me!
She'll slap me!

650
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:03,537
Wait here.

651
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,630
Aren't you going back
to school?

652
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,752
Was it Helena?

653
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,519
lt was, wasn't it?

654
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,682
Did she tell you
awful things about me?

655
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,705
l'm hungry.

656
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:54,799
Go buy something.

657
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:58,809
Do you have money?

658
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:11,856
You can also sell this.

659
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:17,789
Things mom didn't like.

660
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,811
How do l look?

661
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:38,009
l'm going to see
if there's any coffee.

662
01:28:58,066 --> 01:28:59,033
Let's go!

663
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:06,165
Yes, doctor. l have a mark again.

664
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:09,106
One moment, please.

665
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:11,168
What's that?

666
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:14,980
Take that hideous thing
to the corner.

667
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,018
One moment, please.

668
01:29:19,987 --> 01:29:21,045
My ping-pong table!

669
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:23,955
Honey, we can't take
so much crap.

670
01:29:25,093 --> 01:29:27,118
Let's go. l don't want
to be seen here.

671
01:29:30,164 --> 01:29:31,131
Thank you.

672
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:53,220
Here you go.

673
01:29:58,092 --> 01:30:00,117
l want to tell you something.

674
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:03,127
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

675
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,162
That man is hard working.

676
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:07,192
He works in the land.

677
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:12,129
He grows corn and beans.

678
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,208
He works doing anything.

679
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:18,237
-Excuse me.
-lt's okay.

680
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:21,306
That's enough for you.

681
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:23,145
Go home.
Go on.

682
01:30:23,384 --> 01:30:26,285
Go on.
Straight home, okay?

683
01:30:57,218 --> 01:30:58,185
Hey!

684
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:00,319
What's up?

685
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,157
Hop in.

686
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:40,226
-When did Sebastian leave?
-Five days ago.

687
01:31:41,462 --> 01:31:43,293
Want me to look for him?

688
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:45,523
He comes and goes.

689
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,458
He leaves three days,
comes back...

690
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:50,495
...he leaves again.

691
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:53,534
l guess he'll come back.

692
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,274
What are you going to do?

693
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:00,380
l don't know.

694
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:09,386
Promise me you'll come.

695
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,396
ls she pregnant?

696
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:31,502
Will you be okay?

697
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:41,353
Hey, if you need money...

698
01:33:14,722 --> 01:33:15,689
What's wrong?

699
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:23,519
What's wrong?

700
01:33:31,505 --> 01:33:32,472
What is it?

701
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:30,918
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Hello.

702
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:55,949

I'll take care of you, peridot

5
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,379
We now grant this award to Lee Ruby, congratulations

6
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,780
ah, Oh my gosh

7
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,340
how did this happen, how did this happen?

8
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,300
are you really our Ruby?

9
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,800
It's really me!

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,360
How did you do it?

11
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,320
one month ago

12
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,120
The stage that every designer wants their work to be displayed in

13
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,840
Jewelry week!

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,440
It's the best place to see all of the newest trends in jewelry

15
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,320
and I REALLY wanted to go but-

16
00:01:40,40 --> 00:01:42,40
ah, what should I do?

17
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
I don't think I can go over there

18
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,420
I'm sorry!

19
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,240
I'm so sorry

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,59
hey, what do you have to be sorry for?

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,940
Well, would you look at this?

22
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,420
ooh, It's shiny, right?

23
00:02:03,80 --> 00:02:04,880
A ruby ring?

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,460
That's right. A ruby!

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,919
A gemstone that can make you fearless

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,60
This gemstone can push away fear, but It can't completely cure it

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,940
You can use this ring when you need to be brave

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
This ring will give you three chances

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,920
Only three!

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,339
Why?

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,60
How?

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
Ah, that doesn't matter

33
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,260
W-wait!

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,500
Since you can only use it 3 times, use it wisely

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,60
*not sure what he says here*

36
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
Only 3 times, got it?

37
00:02:51,60 --> 00:02:53,60
The day of the awards ceremony

38
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,980
Hey, are you really Lee Ruby?

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,760
why? Is something wrong?

40
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,400
It's the awards ceremony, so I had to dress up of course

41
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,360
What did you say?

42
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,300
Omo, Director, she spoke to me without even mumbling!

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,940
Does this even make sense?

44
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,180
uh, yeah it does

45
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,340
Omo~

46
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
It's the Turquoise Prince!

47
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Ah, our awesome team leader~

48
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Thank you for coming all the way out here to watch our awards ceremony. What did you think of it?

49
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,299
It was really nice thanks to you

50
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,580
I look forward to working with you in the future - We do as well

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
and who is this?

52
00:05:31,40 --> 00:05:34,300
Ah, yes! This is the winner of the Grand Design Award, Lee Ruby

53
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,400
From now on, he will be working with you to help you lanch your brand

54
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,20
Why don't you two get acquainted?

55
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Hello!

56
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Miss Ruby

57
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I was really curious what kind of person you were

58
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,340
Why is that?

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,660
If you look at a piece of jewelry, it usually tells you something about the designer

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,880
Like their personality, or

61
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Maybe even what they look like

62
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
What did you think of my design?

63
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,539
I thought it had a subtle, girly kind of feel to it

64
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,200
Were you right?

65
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,240
Well, the feel is a bit different from the designer but- you're great!

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,240
Calm, cool, confident!

67
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Since we're coming up with a new concept

68
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,120
We'll have a lot to talk about from the set design to the marketing

69
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,440
Even your model campaign

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll work really hard

71
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,820
Model?

72
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,360
Yeah, modelling

73
00:06:49,20 --> 00:06:51,20
Didn't the director tell you?

74
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,760
Getting your face out there is important for a new brand launch

75
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
We'll work hard to make this brand launch successful

76
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,180
oh, don't worry too much Miss Ruby

77
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,280
Your designs are beautiful, so I know it'll be successful

78
00:07:27,40 --> 00:07:29,40
You can trust me

79
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm sorry but I have to go!

80
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
R-r-Ruby

81
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,800
Miss Ruby!

82
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
hey-

83
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,620
What happened?

84
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
wonseok...

85
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,960
Why did I do that?

86
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and then my hair suddenly starting changing

87
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
and even my shoes were changing back!

88
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
and that's how it happened

89
00:08:17,60 --> 00:08:19,60
all because of this ring

90
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,760
you don't believe me do you?

91
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
I believe you!

92
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,680
This is horrible

93
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
What do I do now?

94
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,760
This ring was supposed to turn me into a confident person

95
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,539
Don't cry

96
00:08:40,39 --> 00:08:42,39
You still have two uses left

97
00:08:42,39 --> 00:08:43,260
you can use it again later

98
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,580
But then what do I do when I suddenly change back?

99
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,860
hey-

100
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Do you know why you suddenly changed back?

101
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,280
Didn't that person explain how to use the ring?

102
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
explain?

103
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,940
Caution: 3 chances, effects lasting for only 3 hours

104
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,540
Ruby, give me your hand

105
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,199
why?

106
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,420
Just let me see it

107
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I got you this when I found out you won the award

108
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
oh, It's Peridot

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
That's right. I gemstone that can get rid of all worries

110
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,160
You knew that, didn't you?

111
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,180
so there's no need to worry now

112
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
ah, seriously

113
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,180
what would you do without me?

114
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,420
Ruby's Studio

115
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
Mom...

116
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I came too late, didn't I?

117
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
I'm sorry

118
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,860
Instead

119
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I'll try really hard now

120
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,300
Just watch

121
00:11:34,60 --> 00:11:36,60
Hey, what are you doing?

122
00:11:43,60 --> 00:11:45,60
Here, take this

123
00:11:45,60 --> 00:11:46,260
Yes, sir!

124
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,580
Miss Ruby-

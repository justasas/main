Ruby Ruby Love

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Topaz, show me the way!

7
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
Ruby!

8
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Ah, hello

9
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Uh...yes. Hello!

10
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
I guess Ruby must have gone out

11
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
Uh yeah...I think she uh...

12
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Surprising, right?

13
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
Isn&#39;t Ruby completely different than before?

14
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
Oh! where did she go?

15
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
I&#39;m not sure

16
00:00:26 --> 00:00:27
Seriously, where did she go?

17
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
I just saw her come in here!

18
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
Where could she have gone?

19
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
What is happening?

20
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
Distract them so I can sneak out of here without them noticing!

21
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
No way, this room is too small!

22
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
No way, we can&#39;t

23
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
Wondol! Please~

24
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
Aigoo... Okay

25
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
This is your first time here, right?

26
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
Ah, let&#39;s see...

27
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
This is something Ruby&#39;s mom gave her

28
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
Hey hey heyyyy

29
00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
You&#39;ve never seen anything like this before, have you?

30
00:00:52 --> 00:00:52
Just look

31
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
Just look at this

32
00:00:53 --> 00:00:53
omo

33
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
What&#39;s going on, guys?

34
00:00:54 --> 00:00:54
Ruby!

35
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
You never go out do you?

36
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
out?

37
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
You probably never need to leave this town

38
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
because everything you&#39;d need is right here

39
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
Oh, right!

40
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
There are gem sellers, jewelry stores, and even welders all in this plaza

41
00:01:07 --> 00:01:08
It really is  jewelry heaven

42
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
I love this place, and

43
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Just being here puts me in a good mood

44
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
why?

45
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
well, even though it&#39;s cold I feel like I could walk forever

46
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
It must be nice.

47
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Because you get to walk here every day

48
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
huh?

49
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
oh-yes!

50
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
ah...today is a perfect day to go out

51
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
should we?

52
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
well, let&#39;s go!

53
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
okay

54
00:01:32 --> 00:01:32
Here you go

55
00:01:32 --> 00:01:32
thank you!

56
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
It&#39;s so beautiful here

57
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
I&#39;ve never seen anything like this

58
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
Is this your first time here?

59
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
Didn&#39;t you come here with your boyfriend?

60
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
What? my boyfriend?

61
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
That guy that was just in your office

62
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
Isn&#39;t he your boyfriend?

63
00:01:43 --> 00:01:43
what?

64
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
No, not at all!

65
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
He and I? We&#39;re completely just friends

66
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
He&#39;s my best friend that I&#39;ve done everything with since we were little

67
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
He&#39;s just my buddy

68
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
buddy?

69
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
What a relief

70
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
uh, let&#39;s go!

71
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
I think I like this London blue topaz the best

72
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
right?

73
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
Topaz normally suits the summer, but this london blue topaz has a deeper color

74
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
so it matches the winter well

75
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
Omo! I didn&#39;t know your wife was this pretty!

76
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
This topaz would look lovely on you!

77
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
actually, we-

78
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
really? uh- what do you think of this one Ruby?

79
00:02:12 --> 00:02:14
stop messing around

80
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
I got this for you

81
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
This is a gem that gets rid of all your worries, okay?

82
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
so don&#39;t worry anymore

83
00:02:19 --> 00:02:19
hey!

84
00:02:19 --> 00:02:19
what?

85
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
you haven&#39;t left yet?

86
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
I&#39;m going. I&#39;ll go

87
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
what is this?

88
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
open it

89
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
why are you giving this to me?

90
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
this isn&#39;t a proposal, don&#39;t worry

91
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
should I put it on? - okay

92
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Topaz is one of the rarest gemstones

93
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
and many people say it represents love and affection

94
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Let&#39;s have a look

95
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
wow, it&#39;s beautiful

96
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
it really is pretty

97
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
It matches you well

98
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Why did she put the ring on earlier?

99
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
will it be okay?

100
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
ah, what am I worrying about, it has nothing to do with me

101
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
ah, why aren&#39;t you working properly?

102
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
ah, this thing stinks

103
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
ah, am I being too selfish?

104
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
Ruby!

105
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Aren&#39;t you hungry? Should we go get some dinner?

106
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Dinner?

107
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
I&#39;m sorry- It looks like I have to go now

108
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
No matter how busy you are, you still have to eat

109
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Let&#39;s go

110
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
oh, today I-

111
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
Don;t be like that~ let&#39;s go!

112
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
ah, Ruby what kind of food do-

113
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Ruby?

114
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
Ruby?

115
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
Ruby?

116
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Ruby?

117
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
shh

118
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Ruby, where are you?

119
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Ruby?

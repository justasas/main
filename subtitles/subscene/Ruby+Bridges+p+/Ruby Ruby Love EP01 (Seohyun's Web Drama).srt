subs by Taeyeontaeoff

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,500
I'm not perfect at korean, but I'm better than nothing, right?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,980
Ruby Ruby Love

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,500
The secret of the Ruby Ring

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,920
God has hidden a great present in a secluded place on earth

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
a gift of mystery (?)

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,720
that gift is

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,820
Gemstones

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm a freelance jewelry designer who loves all of the gems of the world

11
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,860
Lee Ruby

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,220
That's me

13
00:00:59,60 --> 00:01:02,60
I have a name that sounds like a brilliant and beautiful jewel but-

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,000
Delivery

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,860
Oh no

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,220
What do I do?

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,60
Delivery!

18
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,399
Just leave the package and go~

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,940
what are you doing?

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,380
Just leave it by the door and-

21
00:01:26,40 --> 00:01:28,40
my biggest flaw is

22
00:01:30,80 --> 00:01:32,80
Severe Agoraphobia

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,280
So I always just stay home

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
and I'm a pathetic Homebody

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,240
Turquoise Prince

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:03,200
How awesome is he going to look today?

27
00:02:12,40 --> 00:02:15,840
Turquoise Prince: Turquoise is the December birthstone that represents success a victory. the stone of success.

28
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,640
My turquoise prince

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,679
He's the handsome guy who always leaves the building at this time

30
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,260
and he always has a cup of coffee

31
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,140
He seems so smart and cool

32
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,220
ah, I wanna see him up close

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,859
are you a pervert?

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,700
This guy is Wondol

35
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,560
no- Gemstone

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,340
this is my one and only friend, butler, delivery guy, etc

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,40
Sometimes he's more like a devil than a friend

38
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,000
but he's actually an all around cool guy

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
He's my best friend

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,140
hey, Ruby!

41
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Here, take this

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,500
and...

43
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,900
hey, what are you doing?

44
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,800
I have to take a picture for the awards

45
00:03:13,80 --> 00:03:14,480
what are you talking about?

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,880
The winner of the Grand Jewelry Design Award:

47
00:03:21,20 --> 00:03:23,20
Lee Ruby!

48
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,320
Ruby...

49
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,940
Ru... Ruby Ruby Ru!

50
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
I won the award?

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,720
really?! - Of course!

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,940
Seriously?!

53
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,19
really? oh my gosh!

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,440
Yes, I did it!

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
oh, by the way

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
I'm supposed to take you to the office

57
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,899
Me? Why?

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,900
there're some things you need to take care of

59
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,780
They told me you had to come

60
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,760
Come on, let's go

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,359
no, I don't want to

62
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm not going out, you know that

63
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,380
Come on, don't you know how much these people have helped you?

64
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
You have to say hi to the artists as well

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,80
But, the thing is-

66
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,420
hey, you know people shouldn't act like this

67
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,980
you need to keep it together

68
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,420
didn't i teach you that?

69
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,480
I don't want to! I'm not going. never!

70
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,920
Come on- no! I don't want to!

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Hurry up, let's go!

72
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,180
It's so dangerous out here

73
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,300
hey, why aren't you coming?

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,760
Let's go

75
00:04:48,80 --> 00:04:50,440
This is the center Director Dan Hobak

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
She's my mom's junior, and my sponsor

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,820
It's not a pumpkin(hobak) you can eat

78
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,280
She's like a pretty jewel

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,900
Ruby! Ruby, Ruby, Ruby

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
You got the award! you did it!

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,960
I can't believe it

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,640
Omo, this is incredible

83
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:20,359
Your mom would have loved to see you win this

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,159
Hobak

85
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,760
I mean, Miss Director

86
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,260
Thank you

87
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,580
It's all thanks to you and this center

88
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,840
hey, what are you saying?

89
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,20
If you're this thankful

90
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,220
If you really are thankful

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Then go to the awards ceremony, you have to

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,320
what?!

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,719
no, I can't go

94
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,760
WHAT?!

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,900
are you serious?

96
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Lee Ruby!

97
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Get it together!

98
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,359
You don't have time for this! you have a chance to launch your own brand!

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,420
How long are you going to live like a hermit?

100
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,820
You seriously need to fix this now

101
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,760
I can launch my own brand?

102
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,940
Yes, we're going to carry your brand

103
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
my own brand?

104
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,40
Yes~

105
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,820
*not sure what she's saying*

106
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,580
But in order to do this, you really need to go to the awards. You know that right?

107
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
If she doesn't go, you're not going to give her the award?

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,260
Well, about that...We're going to give it to you, we will

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,840
But launching your own brand needs to be your first priority

110
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,320
are you going to give it to to Yu Biju?

111
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,340
Biju?

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Thanks Ruby, I'll look after it for you!

113
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Lee Ruby

114
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
If you really want to save your moms legacy

115
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
There's no better chance than this

116
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
You know you have to go, right?

117
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,239
I want to go too

118
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,860
But, I really can't go

119
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Ruby, you can do it

120
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
I'll take you there. You can go

121
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
ah, seriously

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
Mom

123
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,260
I got the Design award!

124
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,680
Surprising, right?

125
00:07:34,20 --> 00:07:36,20
I was surprised too

126
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,400
They told me I could even launch my own brand

127
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,940
It looks like I'll be able to continue what you started

128
00:07:43,20 --> 00:07:45,340
no, I can't

129
00:07:48,40 --> 00:07:50,40
What should I do?

130
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,159
Hobak told me I have to go but...

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,000
5 years ago

132
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
I really can't deal with Ruby

133
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,240
Don't you know how scary she is?

134
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
wait, what happened?

135
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,500
what? what is it?

136
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,700
It's nothing

137
00:08:16,20 --> 00:08:18,20
She got first place this time, right?

138
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,640
So, I went to congratulate her

139
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,120
but she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about

140
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,140
What in the world?

141
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
How rude is she?

142
00:08:30,20 --> 00:08:32,20
she's so rude

143
00:08:32,20 --> 00:08:33,59
It's nothing

144
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,260
Why would someone who wins all the time care what I have to say?

145
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,140
ah, what a bitch

146
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
Did you hear the rumor?

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
That Lee Ruby is a bully?

148
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,199
really? wow...

149
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Maybe she gets first place all the time through bribes

150
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,400
Didn't someone say that she killed her mom?

151
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
wow...

152
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,940
I heard that she changed everything on her face, she's a plastic surgery monster

153
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,460
I'm sorry, mom

154
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,580
It's not that I don't want to do it

155
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
I just can't

156
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
The next day at the awards ceremony

157
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,340
Did she answer?

158
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,540
No she didn't

159
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,280
ah, I guess she can't do it

160
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I told her I could go get her-

161
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
No, we told her we would wait

162
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,380
There's nothing you could have done

163
00:10:28,40 --> 00:10:31,219
If we want to do this right, she needs to do this herself

164
00:10:32,80 --> 00:10:33,700
Director!

165
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,860
Ruby didn't come, right?

166
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
How long has it been since she left the house?

167
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,360
You don't have any right to talk! This is all because of you...

168
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,860
Next up is today's highlight

169
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,200
It's the Grand Design award

170
00:11:24,60 --> 00:11:27,219
hey, you go up there, okay?

171
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,180
The Grand jewelry design award goes to

172
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
The winner is

173
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,220
The winner is

174
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,540
Lee Ruby!

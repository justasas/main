1
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:52,534
There you are.

2
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:56,971
I've been looking for you.

3
00:01:02,348 --> 00:01:04,839
Have you seen my other shoe?

4
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:10,255
What?

5
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,617
What?

6
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:18,896
Why are you looking at me like that?

7
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,108
Go potty.

8
00:01:34,048 --> 00:01:35,413
Scotty.

9
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:39,447
Come on, boy. Scotty.

10
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,712
Go potty, Scotty.

11
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:28,964
Don't look at me like that.

12
00:02:36,978 --> 00:02:38,206
Yes?

13
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:42,148
Great way to start the day, right?

14
00:02:42,818 --> 00:02:44,786
I think I'm gonna puke.

15
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:49,483
Mom said you went on a date last week.
How'd it go?

16
00:02:49,658 --> 00:02:51,125
It was okay.

17
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:54,190
"Okay" as in you got laid?

18
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,497
-Harry.
-What?

19
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,156
She can't hear you.

20
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:02,304
Don't you wanna have sex,
like, ever again in your life?

21
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:06,373
Yes. I just don't think
that I'm the dating type.

22
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,442
Girls only wanna sleep with me
because they read my book in high school.

23
00:03:10,613 --> 00:03:11,637
So?

24
00:03:11,814 --> 00:03:13,543
So they're not interested in me.

25
00:03:13,716 --> 00:03:16,184
They're interested in some idea of me.

26
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,482
That's why you should keep working out.
That way, they'll want you for your body.

27
00:03:23,993 --> 00:03:25,655
What does this thing even do?

28
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,956
It turns you into a god.

29
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:29,689
Keep going.

30
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,932
Hey, I had a weird dream last night.

31
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,506
There was this girl and she was--

32
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,506
What'd she look like?

33
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:43,238
Just a normal girl. Just a girl I made up.

34
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,504
Well, what happened?

35
00:03:45,682 --> 00:03:47,616
She just talked to me.

36
00:03:48,818 --> 00:03:50,342
That's depressing.

37
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,219
Actually, it was really nice.

38
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,321
Seriously? You don't even get laid
in your dreams? That's....

39
00:03:57,494 --> 00:03:59,394
That's just sad.

40
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:08,563
Hey, how's the new book coming along?

41
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:12,402
I don't know. I get a good idea,
like why don't I write about my dad?

42
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:16,445
And then, bam, I start thinking
that it's the stupidest thing ever.

43
00:04:16,614 --> 00:04:19,242
Who wants to read about,
"He was disappointed in me...

44
00:04:19,417 --> 00:04:21,317
...blah, blah, blah, blah"?

45
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,544
Also, I'm feeling ambivalent
about Scotty.

46
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,890
Yeah, he slobbers. He chews things.

47
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,720
He pees like a girl,
which makes me feel inadequate.

48
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:33,561
He needs to go outside a lot, breaks up
my day. That's why I'm not writing.

49
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,256
Do you think that's why you're not writing?

50
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,637
-No.
-Why do think you're not writing?

51
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,266
Can I have Bobby now?

52
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,379
-Do you need Bobby now?
-Yes.

53
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,146
Calvin...

54
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:57,077
...when's the last time you saw a friend?

55
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,783
Harry. Yesterday.

56
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:02,324
No, no.
Someone other than your brother.

57
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:06,623
Uh, have you been giving Bobby
to your other patients?

58
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,561
No, Bobby is just for you.

59
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:12,170
-Because he smells weird.
-Calvin...

60
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:16,000
...when you were deciding to get Scotty,
what did we talk about?

61
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:19,439
What did you say your hopes were?
Do you remember?

62
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,540
That he would help me meet people.

63
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,807
A little louder, please?

64
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,850
That he would be awesome and
we'd take hikes and stuff.

65
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,921
And people would stop to pet him,
and I would meet them.

66
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:33,649
But Scotty gets scared
when people try to pet him.

67
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:35,986
Does that embarrass you?

68
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:40,465
-No.
-I wanna give you a writing assignment.

69
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,624
-I can't write.
-Okay.

70
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,070
This would just be for me.

71
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:47,433
I'd like you to write a page...

72
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:51,737
...about someone who sees Scotty
all slobbery and scared...

73
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,812
...and likes him anyway,
just the way he is.

74
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,415
You think you could do that for me?

75
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:00,349
Can it be bad?

76
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,886
I'd like it to be very bad.

77
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:16,125
I first met Calvin
when he was 19 years old.

78
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:17,963
And he'd already been at the top...

79
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,767
...of The New York Times Best Seller list,
uh, for several months.

80
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,042
And I remember thinking:

81
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:27,043
"Who the fuck is this kid?

82
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:32,112
And, uh, how can I go back in time
and be him?"

83
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,851
A high-school dropout
with acne still on his chin...

84
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:41,825
...gave us what may very well become
a classic American novel.

85
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:45,158
Since then, of course,
we've all enjoyed his short stories...

86
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:49,029
...uh, including last year's novella,
Breakfast for Dinner.

87
00:06:49,403 --> 00:06:52,895
But it was only when I sat down
and reread his novel...

88
00:06:53,073 --> 00:06:57,407
...now available in a beautiful
10th anniversary edition...

89
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:03,073
...that, uh, I realized just how good a writer
Calvin Weir-Fields is.

90
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:05,750
We are lucky to have him around.

91
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,751
Ladies and gentlemen,
Calvin Weir-Fields.

92
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,903
-Phenomenal, man. Just brilliant.
-Thank you. Thanks.

93
00:07:30,078 --> 00:07:31,443
-Brilliant.
-Thanks so much.

94
00:07:31,613 --> 00:07:32,739
-Calvin.
-Hi.

95
00:07:32,914 --> 00:07:35,314
You know that chapter
where Charlie goes to the whorehouse?

96
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:39,249
Did you dress the whores blue because
it's the color of his mother's apron?

97
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:40,581
I'm sorry--

98
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:43,053
How did you know
where to send your manuscript?

99
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:44,486
I looked it up.

100
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,024
Oh, of course.

101
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,958
Is it weird for you
that you used to be so successful?

102
00:07:59,975 --> 00:08:01,909
There's the man.

103
00:08:02,077 --> 00:08:04,204
Cyrus, you gotta remind me
about these things.

104
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,314
You have to check your messages,
buddy.

105
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,382
I would've worn something nicer.

106
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:10,951
No one cares what you're wearing.
You are a genius.

107
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,020
Don't use that word.

108
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:14,516
Mr. Perrotta, over here.

109
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,681
-Calvin always had talent.
-Over here.

110
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,827
But that, unfortunately, is not enough.

111
00:08:18,994 --> 00:08:21,224
-Langdon, right here!
-All I did, really...

112
00:08:21,397 --> 00:08:26,801
...was guide him in the right direction
and, uh, like, pass the baton.

113
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:28,836
Mabel.

114
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:30,062
What?

115
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,866
I'm Mabel.

116
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,875
-Oh, do I know you?
-No, no.

117
00:08:35,045 --> 00:08:36,740
Do you want my number?

118
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:38,710
-It's a one-off, that book.
-Great.

119
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:41,476
-It's the first album of an indie band.
-Thank you.

120
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:45,485
It has that sort of
unselfconscious verve...

121
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,954
...that, um-- That you don't, uh....

122
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:52,060
Then, of course, there's
the second album syndrome, which--

123
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:53,719
We don't talk about that.

124
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:57,025
Everyone loves this book,
but we wanna hear what you're doing now.

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,897
What matters is right now.
What are you working on? Are you...?

126
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:03,369
They love you, then they throw you away.

127
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,703
-I mean, if I'm gonna include anybody....
-It's actually easier...

128
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:09,641
... if you've only ever been mediocre.

129
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:12,438
If you've been at the top--

130
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:14,015
-Hi. Sorry.
-Hi.

131
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,776
--it can kill you.

132
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:19,150
Yeah, Salinger had the right idea. He....

133
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:24,260
Write what you can, then, pssh, disappear,
you know?

134
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:28,358
So I've had a drink.

135
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,866
But no coke. I didn't-- No coke.

136
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:33,594
I didn't do any coke.

137
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:50,511
Scotty?

138
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,951
Scotty?

139
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,291
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

140
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,366
Scotty?

141
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,499
Scotty, what the fuck?

142
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,535
Oh.

143
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:35,989
She's so cute.

144
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:38,430
What?

145
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,266
Your dog. She's so cute.

146
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,334
Oh, he's a boy dog.

147
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,870
He just peed like a girl.

148
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,840
Have we met before?

149
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,985
I don't think so.

150
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,979
Do you mind if I draw him?

151
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,987
Uh, but don't get too close.

152
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,387
He's a little scared of people.

153
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,338
-You're an artist?
-Yeah.

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,906
-I'm super good.
-Really?

155
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,376
-What's your dog's name?
-Uh, Scotty.

156
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:22,104
-Are you Scottish?
-No.

157
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,216
I named him for F. Scott Fitzgerald.

158
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,116
-Who?
-F. Scott Fitzgerald.

159
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,882
The novelist.

160
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,890
Great Gatsby.

161
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,458
I don't read a lot of fiction.

162
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:40,099
You've never heard of
F. Scott Fitzgerald?

163
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:43,100
Why? Is he really famous and important?

164
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,967
Well, he's probably one of the greatest
novelists who ever lived.

165
00:11:47,141 --> 00:11:49,701
Isn't that disrespectful?

166
00:11:49,877 --> 00:11:50,935
What?

167
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,971
Naming your dog after him?
It's a little disrespectful.

168
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,084
-No, it's a gesture.
-Yeah, an aggressive gesture.

169
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,619
Think about it. You're a novelist.
You think this guy's the greatest.

170
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:04,724
So you name your dog after him
to cut him down to size.

171
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,890
This way, you can put him on a leash...

172
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:08,722
...and yell "Bad Scotty"...

173
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,059
...and feel all superior
because you pee inside.

174
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,803
Kill your idols, man. I'm all for it.

175
00:12:20,108 --> 00:12:21,939
All right. Scotty.

176
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,270
Hang on.

177
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,808
-This is beautiful.
-Yeah.

178
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:34,921
Your dog might pee like a lady,
but I like him anyway.

179
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,352
Hey, what did you just say?

180
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:39,925
I like him just the way he is.

181
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:44,756
Yes.

182
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:47,094
Yes. Yes.

183
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:50,260
Yes. Yes.

184
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:26,808
"--pooled into his eyes as though....
Rushed back like blood....

185
00:13:27,176 --> 00:13:28,643
Calvin flushed with...."

186
00:13:30,846 --> 00:13:31,870
You're a genius.

187
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,038
I thought we weren't
gonna use that word.

188
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:37,310
You are really, really super fucking smart.
"I'd like it to be bad."

189
00:13:37,486 --> 00:13:40,080
I'm glad you found something
that inspires you.

190
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,780
Inspires me?

191
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:45,259
It overwhelms me.
I literally cannot sleep or eat.

192
00:13:45,428 --> 00:13:46,861
All I want I do is write.

193
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,864
I mean, I almost didn't come here today
because I didn't wanna be away from her.

194
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:52,961
-Oh, God.
-What?

195
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:56,765
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can't say it out loud.

196
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,670
-It's too stupid.
-I love it when you say stupid things.

197
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:04,405
-Oh, no, this is really profoundly stupid.
-Okay.

198
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:06,641
Ugh.

199
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,785
Okay, so the guy I'm writing....

200
00:14:08,952 --> 00:14:10,419
Yeah, what's his name?

201
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:11,815
Uh, Calvin.

202
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,827
I'm gonna change it.
Uh, anyway, there's a lot of me in him.

203
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,227
What I'm trying to say is...

204
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,432
...it's almost like I'm writing
to spend time with her.

205
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,262
-Who?
-The girl.

206
00:14:26,436 --> 00:14:29,429
The one I'm writing. It's--
I go to sleep at night...

207
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:32,440
...just waiting to get to my typewriter
so I can be with her.

208
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,239
It's like....
It's like I'm falling in love with her.

209
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,247
-That's wonderful.
-I can't fall in love with a girl I write.

210
00:14:39,417 --> 00:14:41,180
-Why not?
-Because she's not real.

211
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:43,411
-Isn't she? Are you sure?
-No. Yes.

212
00:14:43,588 --> 00:14:46,352
She's some motherfucking product
of my imagination!

213
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:52,029
-Oh, Lila treated me so badly.
-I know.

214
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:54,164
Who leaves someone after
their father dies?

215
00:14:54,332 --> 00:14:56,232
Someone who couldn't
love you properly.

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,301
-Someone who is a heartless slut.
-Okay.

217
00:15:00,104 --> 00:15:03,801
-Well, tell me about her.
-I don't wanna talk about Lila anymore.

218
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:08,071
Well, I meant this girl that you're writing.
Tell me about her.

219
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,313
Ruby.

220
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:15,752
Ruby Sparks.

221
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,389
Twenty-six years old.
Raised in Dayton, Ohio.

222
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:22,584
-Why Dayton?
-Sounds romantic.

223
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,821
Ruby's first crushes were
Humphrey Bogart and John Lennon.

224
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:28,466
Cried the day she found out
they were already dead.

225
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:33,200
Ruby got kicked out of high school
for sleeping with her art teacher...

226
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:36,307
...or maybe her Spanish teacher.
I haven't decided yet.

227
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:39,940
Ruby can't drive.
She doesn't own a computer.

228
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:43,905
She hates her middle name,
which is Tiffany.

229
00:15:44,082 --> 00:15:46,983
She always, always roots
for the underdog.

230
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:50,747
She's complicated.
That's what I like best about her.

231
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:53,352
Ruby's not so good at life sometimes.

232
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:57,018
She forgets to open bills
or cash checks and....

233
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:00,161
Her last boyfriend was 49.

234
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,858
The one before that was an alcoholic.

235
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:07,906
She can feel a change coming.
She's looking for it.

236
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,666
Looking for what?

237
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,946
Something new.

238
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:18,844
-Feels good, right?
-Can we stop a second?

239
00:16:19,018 --> 00:16:20,815
Why? You all right?

240
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:24,020
-Hey, Sue.
-Yeah?

241
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,987
They didn't have paprika, so I got cumin.

242
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,751
-Shh, shh!
-They're the same thing, right?

243
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:29,952
Miles went down.
If you wake him, I will beat you.

244
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:33,025
Calvin? You need to thank me
because I cleaned your oven.

245
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,826
-Thank you, Susie.
-Oh, my woman.

246
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,526
Okay. You're sweaty.
Get your mitts off of me.

247
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:01,819
-Susie, did you happen to sha--?
-You didn't tell me you were getting laid.

248
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,088
-Harry.
-I'm just saying.

249
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:06,130
He claims to be writing too much
to haul his ass to our house.

250
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,791
But turns out,
he's just getting too much poon.

251
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,870
-Harry, I swear to God--
-I'm not getting any poon.

252
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,802
Oh, yeah?

253
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:16,409
-Whose is that?
-You tell me.

254
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:19,674
Oh, my God. Scotty.

255
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:22,448
-It's Scotty's?
-No. Scotty--

256
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:24,709
Don't let the baby touch that.
Miles, don't--

257
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,352
-Suse, he likes it.
-No, he doesn't like it.

258
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:30,013
-Scotty's been dragging them in.
-He seems to love it.

259
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:32,250
He goes through
my weird neighbor's garbage.

260
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:34,725
-So that's a random dirty bra?
-It's dirty.

261
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,454
That's gross. You made him cough.

262
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:39,057
Calvin, don't put it away.
Throw it away.

263
00:17:39,234 --> 00:17:41,532
I swear, if your mother knew--

264
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,767
-Calvin, what is this?
-What's what?

265
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,133
-Nothing.
-Harry, get over here.

266
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,133
Uh, please, don't.

267
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,841
-Are these panties?
-Fuck off.

268
00:17:51,012 --> 00:17:52,946
I swear, Scotty's been dragging them in.

269
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,376
-Right. Scotty.
-Shut up.

270
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,950
Calvin, throw these away.

271
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,895
-Hey, Susie, I'm gonna check on Harry.
-Okay.

272
00:18:09,065 --> 00:18:12,159
-Tell him we have to go soon.
-Okay.

273
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:32,077
So?

274
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:35,146
Where do you see this going?

275
00:18:36,192 --> 00:18:38,217
Well, I don't know. I just started.

276
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:41,329
This is a love story, right?

277
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,658
Who reads love stories?

278
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,357
Women.

279
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:48,401
And I'm telling you,
no woman's gonna wanna read this.

280
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:49,697
Why not? It's romantic.

281
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:54,037
Quirky, messy women whose problems
only make them endearing are not real.

282
00:18:54,978 --> 00:18:56,809
Period.

283
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,471
What do they say,
"write what you've been through"?

284
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:02,277
-Write what you know.
-Exactly. Write what you know.

285
00:19:02,452 --> 00:19:04,113
-I've known girls like Ruby.
-Yeah?

286
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,652
Who?

287
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:07,413
Girls.

288
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:09,991
-Lila?
-Not fucking Lila.

289
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,321
-You've had one relationship.
-For five years.

290
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,691
You never even lived together.

291
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:18,793
I'm telling you, Calvin,
the honeymoon shit, it doesn't last.

292
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:22,200
-I know that.
-Women are different up close.

293
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:24,067
I love Susie...

294
00:19:24,407 --> 00:19:26,170
...but she's a weirdo.

295
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:30,609
Sometimes, she's mean as fuck
for no reason.

296
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,008
She's a person.

297
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:37,079
You haven't written a person, okay?

298
00:19:37,254 --> 00:19:39,655
-You've written a girl.
-All right, whatever.

299
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:42,292
Writers don't show their work
to people at this stage.

300
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,428
I might not even finish it.

301
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:47,357
Because--
And don't, like, tell people about it.

302
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,891
Listen. I'm not saying you can't write.

303
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:54,204
I'm saying...

304
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,867
...you don't know jack shit
about women.

305
00:20:01,913 --> 00:20:05,280
Don't let those leftovers go to waste,
okay, skinny?

306
00:20:06,484 --> 00:20:07,542
Gym tomorrow?

307
00:20:07,718 --> 00:20:09,709
Uh, I'm seeing Cyrus.

308
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,583
-Maybe Friday?
-Friday.

309
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,747
-I know.
-You okay, bud?

310
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:16,188
Yes.

311
00:20:49,061 --> 00:20:50,824
This thing is dripping everywhere.

312
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:55,164
How are you supposed to eat this thing?

313
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,231
What?

314
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,779
You're so not my type.

315
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:11,147
What do you mean I'm not your type?

316
00:21:11,985 --> 00:21:18,288
I usually go for guys
who are a little more, um, assertive.

317
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:21,588
-I'm assertive.
-Ha, ha. No.

318
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,127
You're stubborn. That's different.

319
00:21:26,332 --> 00:21:28,027
I had this one boyfriend...

320
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,226
...who told me I wasn't funny...

321
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:32,462
...but that I have a good sense
of humor...

322
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:35,130
...because I laughed at his jokes.

323
00:21:35,308 --> 00:21:37,640
Why would you date a guy like that?

324
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,643
I was young.
You must have things you regret.

325
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:42,075
Not really.

326
00:21:42,248 --> 00:21:44,808
-Everything's been perfect so far.
-Oh.

327
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:53,050
So that's what you're looking for
in a guy?

328
00:21:53,494 --> 00:21:55,223
Douchiness?

329
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,529
I don't know.

330
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,295
I guess I was looking for you.

331
00:22:07,374 --> 00:22:09,740
It just took me a while to find you.

332
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,481
-Ruby.
-Jump!

333
00:22:30,331 --> 00:22:33,129
What did you think
the first time you saw me?

334
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,601
I thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever saw.

335
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,730
Were you disappointed
when you got to know me?

336
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:43,070
How can you ask that?

337
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:44,643
I'm such a mess.

338
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:47,475
I love your mess.

339
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:51,215
The first time I saw you, I thought:

340
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:53,013
"Look at that boy.

341
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:58,922
I'm going to love him
forever and ever and ever. "

342
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,961
-What if you get sick of me?
-I won't.

343
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:05,256
I promise.

344
00:23:12,407 --> 00:23:14,398
Hello. Shit.

345
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,604
Shit.

346
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:25,114
Hello. Damn it.

347
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,556
Okay. No.

348
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:33,055
-Hello.
-Cyrus.

349
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:34,753
-Where the fuck are you?
-Uh, sorry.

350
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:37,228
I was writing, I fell asleep.
I'll be right there.

351
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,062
Look, if you aren't ready to talk about this,
it's fine.

352
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:42,295
No-- No, no.
I wanna show you what I have.

353
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,496
I think you're gonna be really excited.

354
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,836
Of course, I'll be excited. Okay, uh,
here's what I'll do. I'll push my lunch.

355
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,777
Okay. All right. Well, uh, if I leave now,
I should be there in 15 minutes.

356
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:55,109
-All right.
-If there isn't any traffic.

357
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,717
Oh, damn it. Scotty.

358
00:23:56,886 --> 00:23:58,945
-What?
-Uh, nothing. Uh, my dog has to pee.

359
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:01,521
-I'll, uh, put him in the backyard.
-I'll take him out.

360
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,750
-Great. Thank you.
-Cal?

361
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,394
Cal?

362
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:08,194
Hello?

363
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:10,533
I missed you in bed last night.

364
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:13,569
-Did you get some good writing done?
-Are you there?

365
00:24:13,737 --> 00:24:15,364
-Oh, God.
-Hey, you want a bite?

366
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,803
-It's Crispix.
-I think I lost him.

367
00:24:18,608 --> 00:24:22,305
God, it's happening.
It's really happening this time.

368
00:24:22,646 --> 00:24:24,773
-They're gonna hospitalize me.
-What's wrong?

369
00:24:24,948 --> 00:24:28,941
They all thought I was so smart,
but it turns out I was just batshit.

370
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,349
-Calvin?
-What the fuck?

371
00:24:31,922 --> 00:24:33,549
Calvin.

372
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,688
It's not real. It's not real.

373
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,420
It's not real. It's not real.

374
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:41,086
It's not real.

375
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:43,027
Okay, you're dreaming.

376
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,293
Okay, you're dreaming.

377
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:46,834
You're dreaming.

378
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,596
You're dreaming...

379
00:24:48,773 --> 00:24:52,504
...and you're going to wake up...

380
00:24:53,811 --> 00:24:55,711
... right now.

381
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,233
Oh, shit.

382
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,040
-Calvin? Are you mad at me?
-Oh.

383
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:26,836
Oh, God. It's not real.

384
00:25:27,011 --> 00:25:30,947
It's not real. It's not real. It's not real.

385
00:25:32,251 --> 00:25:33,775
Doctor....

386
00:25:41,193 --> 00:25:44,390
Hi, Dr. Rosenthal. It's Calvin Weir-Fields.
Something has come up...

387
00:25:44,563 --> 00:25:48,966
...and I'd appreciate it if you called me
as soon as possible. Thank you.

388
00:26:02,014 --> 00:26:04,278
-Ruby?
-Hey.

389
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:06,212
Um.

390
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:12,890
I thought you might be hungry,
so I'm making you some eggs.

391
00:26:14,593 --> 00:26:16,255
Mm.

392
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:21,064
-What's wrong?
-Oh, nothing.

393
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:22,360
Nothing, uh.

394
00:26:23,069 --> 00:26:26,835
Are these, by any chance, yours?

395
00:26:27,006 --> 00:26:29,566
Yeah, of course, they are.

396
00:26:30,076 --> 00:26:32,510
Who else would they belong to?

397
00:26:33,613 --> 00:26:34,773
Oh, my God.

398
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:38,617
-Are you seeing someone else?
-Oh, no.

399
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:40,446
No, no, no, I'm not....

400
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,249
I'm not seeing anyone other than you.

401
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,384
Will you excuse me?

402
00:26:50,096 --> 00:26:52,894
Remember how Dad used
to say I had an overactive imagination?

403
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:55,296
Are you saying Ruby is in your house?

404
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:56,935
I started seeing her this morning.

405
00:26:57,103 --> 00:27:00,665
It's like that movie Harvey,
except she's not a giant rabbit.

406
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:03,139
It's not like she knows
she's imaginary, either.

407
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,801
She thinks we're in the relationship
in my book.

408
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,540
It is freaking me out.

409
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:11,916
-I'm in the middle of a meeting.
-But this is an emergency.

410
00:27:12,086 --> 00:27:13,519
I may be losing my mind.

411
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:17,513
-Just give me one sec. Just....
-Harry. Harry.

412
00:27:17,691 --> 00:27:20,091
There's no possible way
that Ruby's in your house...

413
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,955
... because she's not a real person.

414
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:26,065
I know objectively she is not real,
but I'm telling you...

415
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,292
...I can see her, I can smell her.

416
00:27:28,469 --> 00:27:30,232
When she touched me, I could feel it.

417
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:33,703
She's making eggs in my kitchen.
Actual eggs.

418
00:27:33,874 --> 00:27:35,136
That's great.

419
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,245
Calvin, I am at work. I'm
in the middle of a very important meeting.

420
00:27:39,413 --> 00:27:41,244
I cannot deal with your shit right now.

421
00:27:41,882 --> 00:27:44,317
Listen to me.
I want you to leave the house...

422
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:47,387
...see a friend. A friend
who can't see your imaginary friend.

423
00:27:47,555 --> 00:27:50,786
If this is still an issue tonight,
we'll talk, okay?

424
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:54,588
Okay. I'll phone a friend.

425
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:56,391
Sorry about that, I was--

426
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:59,658
Kobe's having a barbecue this weekend.
You got plans this weekend?

427
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:01,426
It's Calvin.

428
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,063
Weir-Fields. From high school.

429
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,574
Yeah, the writer.

430
00:28:07,742 --> 00:28:10,142
I sat next to you in Spanish class.

431
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,881
Uh, actually, I gotta go.

432
00:28:48,284 --> 00:28:50,252
Where are you going?

433
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,318
-Out.
-Where?

434
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:56,355
To the store.

435
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:58,259
What for?

436
00:28:58,427 --> 00:29:00,554
To get some stuff.

437
00:29:00,963 --> 00:29:03,557
-Can I come?
-No.

438
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,634
-Why not?
-Because.

439
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,032
-Please?
-No.

440
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:12,565
Please?

441
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,556
--point-nine KCRW.

442
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,561
Up next, tickets for KCRW members.

443
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:38,758
If you haven't won anything from us
in the last 90 days....

444
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:42,598
I hear they're doing a zombie film festival
at the cemetery.

445
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:47,938
You wanna go? We could do a shot
every time someone gets bitten.

446
00:29:48,111 --> 00:29:50,443
Okay. Bye.

447
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:52,104
Bye? Where are you going?

448
00:29:52,282 --> 00:29:53,977
Nowhere.

449
00:29:54,818 --> 00:29:57,686
Café Figaro. I've got this friend.
It won't take long.

450
00:29:57,855 --> 00:29:59,413
What am I supposed to do?

451
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,788
Stay here. Enjoy the shops.

452
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:06,020
I'll be back soon.

453
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,933
When I didn't hear from you right away...

454
00:30:10,101 --> 00:30:12,592
...I figured you had lost my number
or something.

455
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,801
At least that's what my roommate said
must have happened.

456
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:19,810
Oh, no, I didn't lose your number.
Uh, actually the, uh, night I met you...

457
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:23,174
...I started writing something,
so my life's been really consuming.

458
00:30:23,347 --> 00:30:24,541
The night you met me?

459
00:30:24,849 --> 00:30:26,544
Am I...?

460
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:29,242
Never mind. Ha, ha. Never mind.

461
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,183
Um, am I in it?

462
00:30:31,923 --> 00:30:34,187
-I can't really talk about it.
-Right, of course.

463
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:38,727
But if I am, like, when it comes out
in stores and stuff...

464
00:30:38,896 --> 00:30:41,695
-...will you tell me which character I am?
-You're not in it.

465
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,892
Right, but if I am?

466
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:46,163
I will let you know.

467
00:30:46,572 --> 00:30:48,665
Okay. Awesome. Awesome.

468
00:30:53,879 --> 00:30:56,473
So, um, do you do this a lot?

469
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,208
-Do what?
-Meet up in the middle of the day for sex.

470
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:03,118
No. No, that's not--
I just wanted someone to talk to.

471
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,380
Oh.

472
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:07,485
Right. Right.

473
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,389
Well, men never just wanna talk
to women.

474
00:31:10,562 --> 00:31:12,928
-I do.
-lf you say so.

475
00:31:13,098 --> 00:31:15,464
Uh, heh, are you even legal?

476
00:31:15,634 --> 00:31:19,695
I mean, not to drink, but, yeah.

477
00:31:19,872 --> 00:31:21,931
Of course. Do you, um...?

478
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:23,765
Do you wanna go someplace?

479
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,345
-Hi.
-Sorry, what?

480
00:31:28,514 --> 00:31:30,038
Do you wanna go to my place?

481
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:31,774
-Hi.
-Sorry.

482
00:31:31,951 --> 00:31:33,316
-I'm sorry.
-What's going on?

483
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:35,886
-Am I interrupting?
-I thought I heard something.

484
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,319
-Do you wanna get out of here?
-Calvin.

485
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:42,860
-Do you know this girl?
-Yeah. Hi, I'm Ruby, Calvin's girlfriend.

486
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,121
I don't think we've met.

487
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:46,331
Uh, no.

488
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:49,991
Um, I'm Mabel. I was just going.

489
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,228
-You can see her?
-Yeah, she can see me.

490
00:31:52,405 --> 00:31:53,667
I can see her.

491
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,636
-You can see her.
-Let's not make this worse, all right?

492
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,300
-Sorry, I didn't know.
-Did Harry put you up to this?

493
00:31:59,479 --> 00:32:01,470
-What, your brother is in on this?
-What?

494
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:04,583
Ruby, it was very nice meeting you.
Calvin, have fun writing.

495
00:32:05,084 --> 00:32:06,642
Who the fuck was that?

496
00:32:06,819 --> 00:32:08,650
-Can you see her?
-Calvin, who was that?

497
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:11,382
-Can I see her?
-Can he see me? What are you--? Stop.

498
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:12,957
What's wrong with you, man?

499
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:16,457
She's real.

500
00:32:17,264 --> 00:32:19,960
Oh, no. Ruby!

501
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:22,960
Ruby! Ruby.

502
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:24,627
-Get away from me!
-Ruby! Ruby!

503
00:32:24,805 --> 00:32:27,103
-Get away! Get away!
-Ruby!

504
00:32:27,374 --> 00:32:29,035
-Ruby, please, listen to me.
-Let go!

505
00:32:29,209 --> 00:32:30,938
-Stop!
-Listen to me. Calm down. Ruby.

506
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:32,669
-Get away from me!
-Hey, you okay?

507
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,404
You want me to call the police?

508
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:37,812
No. Thank you.
He's just being a complete asshole.

509
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:39,213
Are you sure?

510
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,715
Yeah.

511
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,914
Thank you, I'm fine.

512
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,651
-Ruby.
-You stay away.

513
00:32:49,096 --> 00:32:52,497
God, I should have known.
You've been acting like such a freak-- Stop!

514
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,964
Let go of me!

515
00:32:54,135 --> 00:32:55,159
Put me down!

516
00:32:55,337 --> 00:32:56,861
Put me down or I'm gonna scream!

517
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:58,062
-Ruby.
-Stop it!

518
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,400
-Put me down!
-Ruby?

519
00:33:00,575 --> 00:33:02,042
Oh, my God, stop! Ow!

520
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,077
Shh! Stop it. Oh, do not bite.
Do not bite.

521
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,838
Listen to me. Shh, shh.

522
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:09,711
There is a lot that is new here,
more than I can tell you.

523
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:11,875
I'm having trouble processing it all,
okay?

524
00:33:12,053 --> 00:33:13,782
Then talk to me about it.

525
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:15,718
Don't go on a date with another girl.

526
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,721
I wasn't on a date.

527
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:21,559
-What is going on with you?
-I don't know. I'm sorry.

528
00:33:23,698 --> 00:33:26,929
Oh, I'm just having trouble...

529
00:33:27,102 --> 00:33:30,469
...wrapping my head
around the reality of this situation.

530
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:34,004
That you're here.

531
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,809
That you're real.

532
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:42,943
It all seems pretty incredible.

533
00:33:48,524 --> 00:33:49,889
What?

534
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,853
Kiss me, stupid.

535
00:34:09,645 --> 00:34:11,112
Holy shit.

536
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,207
Mm.

537
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:53,410
Look, I know it's a lot to take in,
but you have to believe me.

538
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:54,643
She's real.

539
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,345
I don't know how or why...

540
00:35:57,523 --> 00:36:01,755
...but she's here and she's real.

541
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,451
And I like it.

542
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:08,396
-"Real" as in other people can see her.
-That's what I'm trying to tell you.

543
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,531
We've been to restaurants.
We take Scotty for walks in the park.

544
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:18,006
-People talk to her. She's very friendly.
-That's impossible.

545
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,509
It's apparently not.

546
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:26,809
What does Dr. Rosenthal say?

547
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:35,020
Are you fucking serious?

548
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,755
People have shrinks
for when they start seeing things.

549
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:39,023
I'm not seeing things.

550
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,429
-Calvin, call him.
-I can't.

551
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,299
I told him when she was a character.
He won't understand.

552
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,905
-Call him or I'm telling Mom.
-He'll think I'm crazy.

553
00:36:48,074 --> 00:36:49,564
You might be crazy.

554
00:36:49,876 --> 00:36:51,935
The situation is crazy.

555
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:53,544
I am not.

556
00:36:53,913 --> 00:36:55,813
Do you hear--? Hi.

557
00:36:55,982 --> 00:36:59,213
Do you hear yourself? Do you?
Do you hear yourself? Really?

558
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:04,819
There's no way that you're sleeping
with a girl that you made up.

559
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:17,468
Hey, so, uh, she doesn't know
that I wrote her...

560
00:37:17,637 --> 00:37:20,072
...so don't say anything
about the manuscript, okay?

561
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,038
Yeah, okay.

562
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:26,510
Hi, Ruby. Great to meet you.
Can we call the doctor now?

563
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,011
-Harry.
-Calvin!

564
00:37:28,182 --> 00:37:29,706
Oof! Hey.

565
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,714
What took you so long?

566
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:34,752
-Hey, Ruby, this is my brother, Harry.
-Hey.

567
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,447
-Harry. Hi.
-Hi.

568
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,923
-Hi. It's great to meet you.
-Hi.

569
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:43,394
I've heard so much about you
from Calvin.

570
00:37:43,564 --> 00:37:45,225
You're Ruby.

571
00:37:45,399 --> 00:37:46,764
You're Harry.

572
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,459
The painter from Dayton, Ohio.

573
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:51,867
-Yep.
-Yep.

574
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,234
Are you staying for supper?
I'm making meat loaf.

575
00:37:54,408 --> 00:37:56,706
She's an amazing cook.

576
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:00,212
Yeah. Can I talk to you a second?
Outside?

577
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,643
Okay.

578
00:38:09,824 --> 00:38:13,316
What did you do? Hire some actress?
Craigslist? This isn't funny.

579
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:14,962
I told you, she just appeared.

580
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,360
-You're a writer, not Ricky Jay.
-I know that.

581
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:20,831
-There's gotta be some logical explanation.
-Love isn't logical.

582
00:38:21,002 --> 00:38:23,368
No, but you know what is?
Physics. Or metaphysics.

583
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,733
-People don't appear out of thin air.
-She did.

584
00:38:25,907 --> 00:38:27,033
-How?
-I don't know how.

585
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,073
It's love. It's magic.

586
00:38:29,244 --> 00:38:30,802
-Okay.
-What are you doing?

587
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:32,310
-Calling your doctor.
-Don't.

588
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,004
-Harry. Harry.
-Give me that.

589
00:38:34,182 --> 00:38:37,208
-We might-- Give me the phone.
-Harry, listen to me, please.

590
00:38:37,752 --> 00:38:39,811
Remember what you told me
when you met Susie?

591
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:43,924
-I certainly didn't pretend I invented her.
-You said that she was your dream girl.

592
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:46,083
That's what happened to me.

593
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:47,524
Harry, don't laugh at me.

594
00:38:47,697 --> 00:38:50,131
Has it occurred to you
that she might be an imposter?

595
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:54,030
Some girl wanted to get close to you,
somehow got her hands on what you wrote.

596
00:38:54,203 --> 00:38:56,262
You're the only one
who's read my manuscript.

597
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:59,203
-So unless you're playing some joke--
-Okay, okay, okay.

598
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,970
Let's say you created this person.
Everything you wrote about her came true.

599
00:39:03,145 --> 00:39:05,773
-Even the smallest things?
-Yes.

600
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:09,213
-Have you tried writing more?
-No.

601
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,452
Write something about her.

602
00:39:12,188 --> 00:39:13,587
Why? She's perfect.

603
00:39:13,756 --> 00:39:15,951
Write something about her,
see if it comes true.

604
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,889
If it does, then you're right
and this is a fucking miracle.

605
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:20,289
And if nothing happens...

606
00:39:22,064 --> 00:39:24,259
...maybe we go to the police.

607
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,531
-Don't call--
-Just go in there and act normal. Go up.

608
00:39:35,879 --> 00:39:37,870
-You act normal.
-I'm not gonna say--

609
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:50,550
We're gonna go upstairs
and check on something, uh, online.

610
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:56,861
Were you guys getting stoned out there?

611
00:39:57,167 --> 00:40:00,432
Okay, here's where I left off.

612
00:40:03,807 --> 00:40:06,367
It has to be something
we notice right away, okay?

613
00:40:06,543 --> 00:40:08,636
Something obvious.

614
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,978
-What she's wearing?
-Yes. Yes.

615
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,640
What she's wearing.

616
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:22,025
What was she wearing?

617
00:40:22,627 --> 00:40:24,424
Was it pink?

618
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:29,026
I got it.

619
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:31,530
Okay. Okay.

620
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:34,603
Write that she speaks fluent in French.

621
00:40:34,772 --> 00:40:36,535
Yeah, just put it down.

622
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:39,870
-I'll do it.
-I-- Shh.

623
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:17,381
Bah!

624
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:31,863
-I'll be right back. I have to do something.
-No, wait, hold it.

625
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,197
Calvin.

626
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:55,151
Bottle of vino.

627
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:59,415
Great. Your brother looks like
he could use a drink.

628
00:42:05,765 --> 00:42:09,394
I have to say,
that's the best meat loaf I've ever had.

629
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,934
Thank you.

630
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:12,469
It's a family recipe.

631
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:14,906
I can't really take credit.

632
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,202
So your-- Your family's in Ohio?

633
00:42:18,545 --> 00:42:22,208
Yeah. Actually, my parents died
when I was a baby in an accident...

634
00:42:22,382 --> 00:42:24,213
...and I got moved around a lot.

635
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:25,612
I guess the habit stuck.

636
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:29,483
-I've lived in nine cities in six years, so--
-Nine?

637
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:32,820
-Yeah.
-Wow, that's a lot of cities.

638
00:42:32,993 --> 00:42:35,621
I'm so sorry. I'm totally
monopolizing this conversation.

639
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,889
No. This is fascinating.

640
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:40,063
Please, keep going. Please.

641
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:42,796
What nice boys.

642
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,770
Your mom must be so proud.
It's hard to raise a decent guy.

643
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:50,274
Oh, I think a person would have to do
something pretty amazing...

644
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:51,934
...to produce a good woman.

645
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,704
Okay. Great.

646
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:57,248
Uh, you guys like each other.
I think Harry has to go now.

647
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:58,476
Right, buddy?

648
00:42:58,652 --> 00:43:01,587
He can be such a control freak, right?

649
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:05,886
-I'll be right back.
-Good night.

650
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,585
-See you soon, I hope.
-Hey. So?

651
00:43:08,762 --> 00:43:10,821
-Get in the car.
-What?

652
00:43:11,332 --> 00:43:13,267
-Get in the car.
-Why? What...?

653
00:43:18,306 --> 00:43:20,501
That was insane!

654
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,771
-Harry--
-This is insane.

655
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:25,708
You manifested a woman with your mind.

656
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:28,916
-Mom's gonna fucking freak.
-Whoa, you can't tell Mom.

657
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:31,644
-Why not? She loves all this New Age shit.
-Seriously...

658
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:34,721
...you can't tell anybody.
Not Mom, not Susie. No one.

659
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:38,052
-This is amazing. How can I not tell?
-They'll think she's a freak.

660
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:42,026
-We're gonna pretend she's your girlfriend?
-She is my girlfriend.

661
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:45,596
Seriously?

662
00:43:45,767 --> 00:43:47,758
-Why not?
-Your girlfriend.

663
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:50,200
-Stranger things have happened.
-I don't think so.

664
00:43:50,772 --> 00:43:55,471
I think this is pretty much the strangest
thing that's ever happened, ever.

665
00:43:55,644 --> 00:43:57,476
You gonna marry her?
Have kids with her?

666
00:43:57,647 --> 00:44:00,548
-I don't know.
-But wouldn't that be like incest?

667
00:44:00,716 --> 00:44:02,980
-Or mind-cest?
-I don't care.

668
00:44:03,686 --> 00:44:05,483
I love her.

669
00:44:05,988 --> 00:44:07,580
Please, don't ruin this for me.

670
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:10,021
Promise me, no one.

671
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:15,026
Fine.

672
00:44:15,564 --> 00:44:16,690
Thank you.

673
00:44:19,669 --> 00:44:23,799
Oh, hey, so you can, like, change her.

674
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,105
I guess.

675
00:44:30,346 --> 00:44:34,806
You could, like, tweak things
if you wanted.

676
00:44:34,984 --> 00:44:37,179
Tweak? What do you mean?

677
00:44:37,353 --> 00:44:39,878
I don't know, like anything.
Big tits, long legs--

678
00:44:40,056 --> 00:44:43,117
-I like her little legs.
-Know how many times I wanted a button...

679
00:44:43,293 --> 00:44:45,989
...to make Susie stop doing
all the annoying shit she does?

680
00:44:46,163 --> 00:44:48,961
I mean, you could get blow jobs
whenever you wanted.

681
00:44:49,132 --> 00:44:50,429
Ruby loves giving blow jobs.

682
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,898
Now, but what about
in a couple months or days?

683
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,868
Women are mysterious creatures.
I still look at Susie like:

684
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,768
"Who are you? Who are you?"

685
00:44:57,941 --> 00:45:00,933
I know Ruby, Harry. I wrote her.

686
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:03,477
So you can make her, like, do anything.

687
00:45:07,184 --> 00:45:09,345
For men everywhere...

688
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:13,080
...tell me you're not gonna let that
go to waste.

689
00:45:16,493 --> 00:45:19,291
I will never write about her again.

690
00:45:28,272 --> 00:45:29,796
Calvin?

691
00:45:30,608 --> 00:45:32,132
Hey.

692
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,974
So did he like me?

693
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:44,387
He loved you.

694
00:46:15,988 --> 00:46:17,956
Stop, stop, stop.

695
00:46:19,491 --> 00:46:21,254
Hey, if it's my mom, please, don't--

696
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:23,585
Hello?

697
00:46:24,363 --> 00:46:26,263
Hello, is anyone there? I don't--

698
00:46:26,431 --> 00:46:27,557
Hi, Mom.

699
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:31,328
Oh, hi, sweetie. Hi.
I wasn't sure you were there.

700
00:46:31,503 --> 00:46:33,130
What do you want, Mom?

701
00:46:33,305 --> 00:46:35,967
I was wondering if
you're gonna make it up this weekend.

702
00:46:36,141 --> 00:46:38,735
I told you we can't this weekend.
We're busy.

703
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,503
-Oh, with what?
-Busy with what?

704
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:42,874
Your brother says
you haven't been writing.

705
00:46:43,048 --> 00:46:45,676
-He doesn't know.
-You've been with this girl for months.

706
00:46:45,851 --> 00:46:48,979
I haven't even met her.
I'm beginning to think she doesn't exist.

707
00:46:49,154 --> 00:46:51,281
What? No. I mean, yes.

708
00:46:51,456 --> 00:46:53,891
-So when can I meet her?
-Soon.

709
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,893
Next weekend?
Harry and Susie will be here.

710
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,087
Come on, please?

711
00:46:58,264 --> 00:46:59,356
Look, we have plans.

712
00:46:59,532 --> 00:47:01,932
I'm gonna call you later, okay?
I'm driving.

713
00:47:03,002 --> 00:47:05,061
Why can't we go to Big Sur?

714
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:08,730
Uh, well, we'd have to find someone
to watch Scotty.

715
00:47:08,908 --> 00:47:10,432
We could take him with us.

716
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,475
I don't know. Mort....

717
00:47:12,645 --> 00:47:14,374
Their house is weird.

718
00:47:14,547 --> 00:47:15,912
You don't want me to meet your mom.

719
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:18,243
Of course, I want you to meet my mom.

720
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,886
I'll invite her down for Christmas, okay?

721
00:47:25,558 --> 00:47:29,324
Hey, you know that coffee shop on Dwyer?
The new one?

722
00:47:29,495 --> 00:47:31,087
Yes.

723
00:47:32,065 --> 00:47:36,058
I was thinking maybe
I could try to get a job there.

724
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:39,634
Well, I told you,
I'm happy to support you while you paint.

725
00:47:41,075 --> 00:47:43,703
Honey, I'm sort of tired.

726
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,102
Okay.

727
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,305
Let's turn out the light, then.

728
00:47:57,992 --> 00:48:01,758
It's just, maybe if I wasn't around,
you could get more writing done.

729
00:48:01,929 --> 00:48:04,989
Weren't you working on something
when we first met?

730
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:09,669
Calvin?

731
00:48:20,948 --> 00:48:22,780
What are you doing?

732
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,218
Just packing for Big Sur.

733
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:29,084
Really?

734
00:48:29,257 --> 00:48:30,690
Yeah.

735
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:17,866
Wow, look at this place.

736
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:21,601
All right, this is it.

737
00:49:21,777 --> 00:49:23,870
You asked for it.

738
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:26,446
You have nothing to worry about.

739
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,981
Look, why don't we stay
somewhere else tonight?

740
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:36,798
Just you and me. There's a thousand
bed-and-breakfasts around.

741
00:49:36,968 --> 00:49:39,459
-Honey, it's gonna be great.
-It could be romantic.

742
00:49:39,638 --> 00:49:41,731
-Finally.
-Hi.

743
00:49:41,907 --> 00:49:43,431
-You're here!
-Hi.

744
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:44,632
-Hi.
-Hi.

745
00:49:44,809 --> 00:49:46,003
-Okay.
-Hi, Scotty.

746
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:49,203
-Hi. Come on. Come on, Scotty.
-Okay.

747
00:49:49,381 --> 00:49:50,610
-Hi.
-Hello. Hi.

748
00:49:50,783 --> 00:49:52,410
-Hi. I'm Ruby.
-Hi, Ruby.

749
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:53,916
Hi.

750
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,053
Wow, your garden is so amazing.

751
00:49:58,224 --> 00:50:00,784
All the plants have medicinal purposes.

752
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,485
-Medicinal.
-Yeah.

753
00:50:03,663 --> 00:50:05,961
That is very cool.

754
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:09,627
Whoa.

755
00:50:10,436 --> 00:50:12,734
-This is incredible.
-Yeah.

756
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:16,432
He started it in 1980
and he just keeps adding to it.

757
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,634
It's his masterpiece.

758
00:50:18,811 --> 00:50:20,369
-Mort built all of this?
-Yeah.

759
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:23,379
-Can you believe it?
-Yes, I can.

760
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:27,849
And this is where we live.

761
00:50:28,554 --> 00:50:31,045
Oh, my God.

762
00:50:31,223 --> 00:50:32,815
This is so beautiful.

763
00:50:33,994 --> 00:50:35,427
Wow.

764
00:50:35,595 --> 00:50:38,120
I feel like I'm in some kind of temple.

765
00:50:38,298 --> 00:50:42,928
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you said that.

766
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:46,504
-Calvin, she is so intuitive.
-What? What? What?

767
00:50:46,673 --> 00:50:49,801
Mort got this wood from Amish land.
It was blessed.

768
00:50:49,977 --> 00:50:53,208
And the bricks come from an old
Catholic school that was torn down.

769
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,779
That's incredible.

770
00:50:54,948 --> 00:50:56,939
Stairway, bedroom.

771
00:50:57,117 --> 00:50:59,210
That's where Harry will sleep.

772
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:01,411
This is my study. Don't go in there.

773
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:04,079
I'm re-alphabetizing.

774
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:07,953
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

775
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:11,291
Oh, it's like a little nest.

776
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:14,525
Uh, Mom, we're in here? There are no doors.

777
00:51:14,835 --> 00:51:17,201
No one's interested
in your business, honey.

778
00:51:18,873 --> 00:51:21,137
Well, this is the bathroom.

779
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:22,901
We have our own well.

780
00:51:24,812 --> 00:51:27,212
This is Mort's workshop!

781
00:51:29,217 --> 00:51:32,152
He makes driftwood furniture!

782
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,719
Mort!

783
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:37,687
Mort, honey, they're here!

784
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:39,588
Hey!

785
00:51:39,827 --> 00:51:41,556
Welcome!

786
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:43,296
That's a good boy, good boy.

787
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:46,399
-He is such a good boy.
-So, Ruby...

788
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,398
...did you go to art school?

789
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,059
No, I didn't train formally.

790
00:51:50,238 --> 00:51:52,365
I just sort of picked things up
here and there.

791
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,169
That's right. Just do it.
You learn more that way, eh?

792
00:51:56,344 --> 00:51:58,312
I mean, look at Calvin, eh?

793
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:00,845
Right, hijo mio? Ha-ha-ha.

794
00:52:01,015 --> 00:52:03,280
Um, Mort, could you not feed Scotty?

795
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,977
-Aw, don't worry. He loves it.
-It'll upset his stomach.

796
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:08,749
Dogs love human food. They do.

797
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:10,551
-No, they don't.
-They do.

798
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:12,250
I painted when I was young.

799
00:52:12,428 --> 00:52:13,725
-Did you?
-Yeah.

800
00:52:13,896 --> 00:52:15,830
Calvin never told me.

801
00:52:15,998 --> 00:52:17,693
Well, their father didn't approve.

802
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:19,333
Because she painted porn.

803
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:21,230
-Nudes.
-In positions.

804
00:52:21,403 --> 00:52:22,870
It was basically porn.

805
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:25,836
I think they are very sexy, Harry.

806
00:52:26,008 --> 00:52:29,136
Mort's been encouraging me
to take it up again.

807
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:31,609
You should do it, Mama.
You're very good at it.

808
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,372
Lovey.

809
00:52:33,549 --> 00:52:35,779
-You're good at everything.
-Lovey.

810
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:37,612
Everything is so good, Mama.

811
00:52:37,786 --> 00:52:39,617
-Oh, sweetie.
-So good.

812
00:52:39,788 --> 00:52:41,050
-Okay.
-Let's go, let's go.

813
00:52:41,223 --> 00:52:42,815
One minute left. One minute.

814
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:44,083
First word!

815
00:52:44,259 --> 00:52:45,385
-A little word.
-No, big word.

816
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:47,325
-Uh, if. It's.
-Uh, and.

817
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,589
-It's.
-Uh, the, the, the.

818
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,494
-Well, uh--
-What.

819
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:52,391
-What.
-What?

820
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:53,661
What.

821
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,533
What.

822
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,435
-Thank you, Mort.
-You're on our team.

823
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,132
-Second word.
-You're on our team.

824
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,308
-Uh, redwoods.
-They're not gonna get it.

825
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,880
-You and me. Not them. Us.
-Us.

826
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:07,073
-We, uh--
-Us.

827
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,376
A girl's, uh....

828
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:10,712
-The T's and butt, um--
-Ugh!

829
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,320
-Babies! Girls?
-Oh, boy.

830
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,513
-Women!
-Women?

831
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,682
-"What women."
-Mort.

832
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,952
"What women."

833
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:19,459
-What Women Want?
-What Women Want.

834
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,358
Oh, they won!

835
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,797
-What Women Want? Who picks that?
-Come over here.

836
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,698
-You're so good.
-Mort? He picked it?

837
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,396
I love you. Oh, my God. You win the prize.

838
00:53:30,573 --> 00:53:32,041
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

839
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,643
-I'm her trainer.
-But that was against the rules!

840
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:39,539
Calvin.

841
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,181
Calvin.

842
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,013
I forgot to tell you.

843
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:47,749
Your mom said that she was gonna
teach me how to bake a pie.

844
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:52,487
She says we can just go out in the garden
and pick the berries ourselves.

845
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:55,496
Isn't that amazing?

846
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,100
She didn't used to be like this.

847
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:01,995
Like what?

848
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:08,136
When Dad was around,
she wore polo shirts and cooked meat.

849
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:10,678
It's like she's been brainwashed.

850
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:15,612
I think she and Mort seem really happy.

851
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:26,723
-Ah!
-Calvin!

852
00:54:26,898 --> 00:54:28,092
-Watch out!
-Come on!

853
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,800
-Come down here!
-Hey, Calvin!

854
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,434
Calvin! Calvin!

855
00:54:33,605 --> 00:54:35,129
-Let's go!
-Watch out!

856
00:54:35,307 --> 00:54:38,504
-The water's great, man, come on.
-It's beautiful!

857
00:54:38,677 --> 00:54:39,803
No, thanks.

858
00:54:40,178 --> 00:54:44,911
-Oh, it's so fun. You're missing out.
-I promised Langdon I'd finish his book.

859
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:47,415
Why don't you come up here with me?

860
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:49,383
Okay, enjoy yourself!

861
00:54:49,688 --> 00:54:50,916
Mort, be careful.

862
00:54:51,089 --> 00:54:53,489
Asteroid!

863
00:54:56,061 --> 00:54:57,585
Yeah!

864
00:54:57,762 --> 00:55:00,163
-Yeah!
-That was beautiful.

865
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:02,291
Now do it with me. Do it with me.

866
00:55:13,713 --> 00:55:15,738
Calvin, honey?

867
00:55:18,417 --> 00:55:20,408
Are you okay?

868
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,311
Yeah. I'm fine.

869
00:55:23,756 --> 00:55:24,780
Okay.

870
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:27,255
I'm really glad you brought her.

871
00:55:27,426 --> 00:55:29,257
It means a lot to me.

872
00:55:29,428 --> 00:55:30,725
Okay.

873
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:32,420
Okay.

874
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:35,598
Dinner's in a half hour.

875
00:55:39,772 --> 00:55:41,364
But, hey, Harry, Harry, Harry.

876
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,772
-You wanna see my impression of Scotty?
-Yeah.

877
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,678
That makes me laugh.

878
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:51,579
Wanna see my impression of Scotty
when he's really angry?

879
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:52,946
Yeah.

880
00:55:53,687 --> 00:55:54,711
That's so wrong.

881
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,355
He's an intellectual.

882
00:56:00,761 --> 00:56:03,025
Oh, that is good.

883
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:04,828
Uh, don't make fun of Scotty.

884
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:08,824
Oh, calm down.

885
00:56:09,002 --> 00:56:11,903
-Hey, come on. Take it.
-Oh, my God. You look so cute here.

886
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:14,540
-That was such a classic.
-I told you I don't want it.

887
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:18,542
-You should try it. It's really mellow.
-It's all right. He doesn't need it.

888
00:56:18,879 --> 00:56:21,677
-His brain is big enough.
-Yeah, no, it's big.

889
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:23,713
It's so big, he can--

890
00:56:23,884 --> 00:56:26,785
Just with his thoughts, he can just--
He thinks it and:

891
00:56:28,256 --> 00:56:29,484
-Harry?
-Just....

892
00:56:29,657 --> 00:56:31,682
-Just....
-Honey, not here.

893
00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:34,726
One thought. I mean, he just can just, poof.

894
00:56:34,896 --> 00:56:37,421
-He just, poof.
-Harry, I think you've had enough.

895
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:38,826
-Oh.
-Ha-ha-ha.

896
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,936
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about I love you.

897
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:46,401
-What?
-Yay, someone is ready for bed.

898
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:48,565
-Yeah, I'm definitely ready.
-Let's go.

899
00:56:48,743 --> 00:56:50,210
Well, this was a great dinner.

900
00:56:50,378 --> 00:56:51,902
Ooh!

901
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,674
-Here, let me-- Let me help you.
-You know what, Mort?

902
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:57,283
-I think you've done plenty.
-Uh.

903
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:59,448
-Yeah. Good night.
-Great, great.

904
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,814
-You okay?
-Yeah, you okay?

905
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:02,421
-Go.
-I'm fine.

906
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:03,716
Big Sur, everybody.

907
00:57:03,891 --> 00:57:07,622
-Come on, crazy.
-I love this place. Love you.

908
00:57:07,795 --> 00:57:11,994
I think I'm gonna go inside
and, uh, talk to him.

909
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:13,725
Okay.

910
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:19,531
I'm sorry.

911
00:57:19,875 --> 00:57:21,399
No, it's okay.

912
00:57:21,577 --> 00:57:24,273
As long as I know
he isn't like this all the time.

913
00:57:24,646 --> 00:57:26,705
-He isn't.
-Oh.

914
00:57:26,882 --> 00:57:28,315
Good.

915
00:57:30,686 --> 00:57:32,347
Ah.

916
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,527
Look.

917
00:57:39,728 --> 00:57:42,288
-Is that you?
-Heh, yes.

918
00:57:42,464 --> 00:57:44,091
-Wow.
-And that was Jack.

919
00:57:45,234 --> 00:57:46,701
He's so handsome.

920
00:57:46,869 --> 00:57:50,464
Yes, and very, very serious,
just like Calvin.

921
00:57:50,839 --> 00:57:52,431
-He was a golfer?
-Ruby?

922
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:54,872
-Wha--? Hey.
-Ruby, bed.

923
00:57:55,043 --> 00:57:56,068
-Right now?
-Yes.

924
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:58,146
Why won't you take it?

925
00:57:58,314 --> 00:57:59,838
I want you to have it.

926
00:58:00,016 --> 00:58:03,679
-What's going on?
-Calvin won't accept my present.

927
00:58:03,853 --> 00:58:04,979
Why not?

928
00:58:05,155 --> 00:58:08,090
-Mort works hard on his furniture.
-Yeah.

929
00:58:08,258 --> 00:58:11,819
-I call it the Lone Pine.
-That's beautiful.

930
00:58:11,995 --> 00:58:15,658
-Don't you like it?
-Of course, he does. It's a great chair.

931
00:58:15,832 --> 00:58:18,596
Come on, sit down, sit down.
Just feel the wood.

932
00:58:18,768 --> 00:58:20,360
Calvin....

933
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,987
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

934
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:45,628
Dinky do

935
00:58:45,796 --> 00:58:49,232
I love you

936
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,630
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

937
00:58:51,802 --> 00:58:53,326
Dinky do

938
00:58:53,504 --> 00:58:56,200
I love you

939
00:58:57,074 --> 00:58:59,872
I love you in the morning
And in the afternoon

940
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:01,739
Honey, I'm trying to read.

941
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,082
Ruby?

942
00:59:19,563 --> 00:59:22,760
You read your stupid book all weekend.

943
00:59:24,268 --> 00:59:27,295
Your mom and Mort were trying so hard.

944
00:59:27,472 --> 00:59:29,269
I'm sorry.

945
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,679
You don't have any friends.

946
00:59:44,022 --> 00:59:45,455
I have you.

947
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,187
I don't need anyone else.

948
00:59:48,927 --> 00:59:51,122
That's a lot of pressure.

949
00:59:53,865 --> 00:59:58,268
-I'm so lonely.
-No. Don't say that. Please.

950
01:00:01,439 --> 01:00:02,463
What do we do?

951
01:00:04,376 --> 01:00:06,571
How do we make it better?

952
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,712
-Maybe I could take an art class.
-Great.

953
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:15,945
An art class. Get out of the house.
It's good.

954
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:21,358
And I think I should start spending
some nights at my apartment again.

955
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:23,761
Your apartment?

956
01:00:24,864 --> 01:00:26,491
One night a week.

957
01:00:27,066 --> 01:00:29,091
As an experiment.

958
01:00:32,638 --> 01:00:34,503
Okay.

959
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,384
Hi, Scotty. Come here.

960
01:00:55,596 --> 01:00:57,291
The teacher's just amazing.

961
01:00:57,464 --> 01:01:02,458
It's kind of an older group,
but the talent level's really high.

962
01:01:02,936 --> 01:01:05,268
I think I'm gonna learn a lot.

963
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,635
-How was your night?
-Terrible.

964
01:01:11,812 --> 01:01:13,643
I'm sorry.

965
01:01:13,814 --> 01:01:16,806
I don't think this experiment
is gonna work for me.

966
01:01:18,352 --> 01:01:21,048
There has to be space
in the relationship.

967
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:24,384
Otherwise,
it's like we're the same person.

968
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:28,583
Listen, it's one night a week.
I think you can handle it.

969
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:31,221
I've gotta take a shower.

970
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:34,894
Come on, baby.

971
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:54,879
Hello?

972
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:57,149
-Hi.
-Hi. Where are you?

973
01:01:57,592 --> 01:02:03,224
Um, a bunch of people from class
decided to go out, so we're at this bar.

974
01:02:03,398 --> 01:02:04,990
When you coming home?

975
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,532
I don't know. We just got here.

976
01:02:08,002 --> 01:02:09,799
I cooked.

977
01:02:10,605 --> 01:02:13,938
Sorry, no. You know,
I think that we're just gonna eat here.

978
01:02:14,108 --> 01:02:15,939
I mean, we already ordered, so....

979
01:02:18,346 --> 01:02:20,337
So when are you coming home?

980
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:24,885
I don't know. Your place is kind of far
and we're drinking, so....

981
01:02:26,655 --> 01:02:29,419
You know, I might be kind of late.

982
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:32,059
Why don't we just see each other
tomorrow?

983
01:02:35,264 --> 01:02:38,665
-Calvin?
-Yeah.

984
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:43,229
Okay. Um, have a great time.

985
01:04:16,801 --> 01:04:19,463
Calvin, I wanna come home.

986
01:04:26,076 --> 01:04:29,443
-No.
-I have to pee.

987
01:04:29,747 --> 01:04:31,578
Stay.

988
01:04:58,243 --> 01:05:00,711
I miss you right now.

989
01:05:04,549 --> 01:05:07,211
Oh, Calvin.

990
01:05:09,654 --> 01:05:12,384
-I'd rather not talk about it.
-I'm sorry.

991
01:05:12,757 --> 01:05:14,622
I always thought you walked alone.

992
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:17,961
No man walks alone from choice.

993
01:05:20,533 --> 01:05:22,626
-Where are you going?
-To get the phone.

994
01:05:22,802 --> 01:05:24,827
Can I come with you?

995
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,578
Two for the 7:45.

996
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:45,417
It's sold out. There's a 9:00.

997
01:05:45,825 --> 01:05:47,918
Take a walk first?

998
01:05:49,228 --> 01:05:51,093
Two for the 9.

999
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,799
Look at this.

1000
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:12,609
Hello?

1001
01:06:12,786 --> 01:06:14,720
Look who answered their phone.

1002
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,220
Cyrus, hey. Sorry, I've been busy.

1003
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,656
-No worries, man. Busy writing?
-Uh, yeah.

1004
01:06:20,827 --> 01:06:23,921
Yeah? Good, that's great.
I keep telling them you're working on it.

1005
01:06:24,097 --> 01:06:26,622
The publishers are getting anxious
about the new book--

1006
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,824
Right, the new book.

1007
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:31,698
-You seemed excited about it a while back--
-I'm out right now--

1008
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:34,534
Any progress since then?
Can I give them some time line--?

1009
01:06:34,708 --> 01:06:37,472
-Cyrus, I'm gonna call you back.
-What?

1010
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:41,476
Ruby?

1011
01:06:46,788 --> 01:06:48,449
Ruby!

1012
01:06:53,294 --> 01:06:55,285
Ruby!

1013
01:07:03,204 --> 01:07:06,867
Hey. Hey, hey. What happened?
I turned around and you were gone.

1014
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:09,271
-You let go of my hand.
-I-- What?

1015
01:07:09,444 --> 01:07:11,275
You let go of my hand.

1016
01:07:11,446 --> 01:07:15,041
What--? I had to pick up the phone.

1017
01:07:15,216 --> 01:07:17,810
-I know, but you let go.
-Ruby.

1018
01:07:18,252 --> 01:07:22,052
You didn't even notice I was gone.

1019
01:07:22,523 --> 01:07:24,150
Ruby.

1020
01:07:24,325 --> 01:07:27,317
Sweetie, you have to calm down.

1021
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:33,957
-I'm gonna get you some water, okay?
-No.

1022
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:36,662
-No.
-I'll be right back.

1023
01:08:07,336 --> 01:08:09,327
Hi, dummy.

1024
01:08:11,707 --> 01:08:13,197
Hi.

1025
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:20,875
Aah, he's chasing me.
Ha-ha-ha. No.

1026
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:24,709
Miles. Yay, Miles.

1027
01:08:24,888 --> 01:08:26,913
-Thanks.
-He's a water baby.

1028
01:08:27,090 --> 01:08:29,149
-Can I ask something?
-I'm coming to get you.

1029
01:08:29,325 --> 01:08:30,485
Shoot.

1030
01:08:32,095 --> 01:08:35,087
-What if I told you I was writing again?
-Oh, no, he kicked me.

1031
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:36,425
Hey, that's fantastic.

1032
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:39,661
-What's it about?
-Um....

1033
01:08:40,937 --> 01:08:42,564
Writing again.

1034
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:45,537
All right! Meow! Meow! Meow!

1035
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,938
-Oh. Hi.
-How's it going?

1036
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:49,135
Good.

1037
01:08:49,312 --> 01:08:51,246
-Her tits?
-No.

1038
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:54,412
She wasn't happy.

1039
01:08:55,652 --> 01:08:57,950
-So I made her happy...
-I'm a queen!

1040
01:08:58,121 --> 01:08:59,953
...and now she's like this all the time.

1041
01:09:02,126 --> 01:09:04,924
What are you asking me?
If it's moral? I don't know.

1042
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:07,793
It's obviously working.

1043
01:09:08,232 --> 01:09:09,426
Think of it like Prozac.

1044
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:13,259
-But how do I know it's real?
-It's not, okay? She's not.

1045
01:09:13,437 --> 01:09:15,302
She i-- She was.

1046
01:09:15,473 --> 01:09:17,270
Oh, no.

1047
01:09:17,441 --> 01:09:20,137
-I want to be what's making her happy...
-I love you, baby.

1048
01:09:20,311 --> 01:09:22,211
...without making her happy.

1049
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:25,073
So write "Ruby went back to normal."
No big deal.

1050
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:27,774
I'm a puppy dog swimming in the water.

1051
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:29,943
I think she was gonna leave me before.

1052
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:33,989
Help. Help. Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

1053
01:09:38,028 --> 01:09:40,121
Susie left once.

1054
01:09:40,431 --> 01:09:43,663
When? Why didn't you tell me?

1055
01:09:43,835 --> 01:09:46,030
You had a lot going on.

1056
01:09:46,204 --> 01:09:47,228
And she came back.

1057
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,301
But I still think about it.

1058
01:09:50,475 --> 01:09:52,340
I could lose her any moment.

1059
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:15,591
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

1060
01:10:19,104 --> 01:10:22,130
I'm thinking about going away
for a few months.

1061
01:10:22,307 --> 01:10:25,299
-By myself.
-Where do you wanna go?

1062
01:10:27,613 --> 01:10:30,810
I don't know. Um, somewhere far.

1063
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:35,548
You could send me postcards.
I love getting mail.

1064
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:40,557
Or I might hole up here in the house,
not even go outside.

1065
01:10:40,726 --> 01:10:42,216
Cool.

1066
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:45,228
We could build a pillow fort.

1067
01:11:23,637 --> 01:11:26,333
This is your proving
ground. Start with you, Michelle.

1068
01:11:26,506 --> 01:11:28,872
-Yes.
-You have a superior walk.

1069
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:31,374
-I can see you doing runway, but....
-Thank you.

1070
01:11:31,545 --> 01:11:33,536
What are you doing?
We have Langdon's party.

1071
01:11:33,714 --> 01:11:35,306
-Who?
-Langdon Tharp.

1072
01:11:35,482 --> 01:11:38,474
-The writer. His book party's tonight.
-Hey, I was watching that.

1073
01:11:38,652 --> 01:11:40,984
-Yeah, for days.
-It's a marathon.

1074
01:11:41,154 --> 01:11:43,748
You were always asking me
to make plans for us. I did.

1075
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,690
Don't quote me to myself.
I am allowed to change my mind.

1076
01:11:47,861 --> 01:11:52,093
-I don't want to fight about this.
-Fine, great! Let's ignore it, then.

1077
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,791
Now look at Sheila.
Sheila has such a unique look.

1078
01:11:54,968 --> 01:11:57,802
And I think that's wonderful.
We've all noticed it.

1079
01:11:59,574 --> 01:12:01,269
We love your energy.

1080
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,570
Sally made a really interesting
choice using that big tease...

1081
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:05,804
...but it was too much.

1082
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:08,540
She's not afraid to be bold.

1083
01:12:15,323 --> 01:12:17,382
I'm sorry.

1084
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:24,598
Everything's been so up and down lately,
you know?

1085
01:12:26,734 --> 01:12:30,295
It's like my internal compass
is just gone.

1086
01:12:34,409 --> 01:12:36,240
Maybe I should talk to someone.

1087
01:12:36,411 --> 01:12:39,403
You used to see someone, didn't you?

1088
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,947
Uh, Dr. Rosenthal.

1089
01:12:42,484 --> 01:12:44,884
Maybe you should go back.

1090
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:47,885
I thought we were talking about you.

1091
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:52,621
Yeah, yeah, we are.

1092
01:12:53,862 --> 01:12:57,025
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need to get out.

1093
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:59,861
See people. Be social.

1094
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:03,268
This party's gonna be fun.

1095
01:13:09,111 --> 01:13:11,978
Langdon. Hey, Langdon, hey.

1096
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:13,842
Welcome to my cult.

1097
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:17,144
-Cal, you have to talk to Adam and Mandi.
-Who?

1098
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:20,186
Adam and Mandi. The producers
who wanna take over your option.

1099
01:13:20,356 --> 01:13:23,052
-Please, check your messages.
-Cyrus, this is Ruby.

1100
01:13:23,225 --> 01:13:24,750
-Hi.
-Ruby.

1101
01:13:24,928 --> 01:13:26,657
Cyrus. Nice.

1102
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:28,354
-This is Saskia.
-Hi.

1103
01:13:28,531 --> 01:13:30,158
-Okay. Come.
-Hi.

1104
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,631
Stay there, I'll be right back.

1105
01:13:36,206 --> 01:13:38,174
You wanna write
the screenplay yourself?

1106
01:13:38,341 --> 01:13:40,969
Oh, of course. Yes, absolutely.
Who else would?

1107
01:13:41,144 --> 01:13:43,112
I don't know. I've never written one.

1108
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:45,941
My God, you're such a genius,
you'd pick it up like that.

1109
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:48,710
-I've been telling him that.
-He doesn't like that word.

1110
01:13:48,885 --> 01:13:50,318
Who'd you wanna play Charlie?

1111
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:52,717
-I mean, that's the question, right?
-Yeah.

1112
01:13:58,495 --> 01:14:01,293
You should come
and talk to me about it sometime.

1113
01:14:10,074 --> 01:14:13,510
Now, Adam and Mandi come in
with experience from documentary films.

1114
01:14:13,677 --> 01:14:14,837
Yeah.

1115
01:14:15,012 --> 01:14:17,480
Everything they touch is authentic.
They make it real.

1116
01:14:17,648 --> 01:14:20,947
-Grounded in reality and--
-We treat narrative the exact same way--

1117
01:14:21,118 --> 01:14:23,177
-You saw the baby documentary they did.
-Yes.

1118
01:14:23,354 --> 01:14:25,447
-Okay. Genius.
-Made me wanna have a kid.

1119
01:14:25,623 --> 01:14:28,217
You have no idea how many people
told us the same thing.

1120
01:14:28,392 --> 01:14:31,122
-Well, it's true.
-Can you hold this just for a second?

1121
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,559
-No, sorry, I'll be right back.
-Yeah, absolutely.

1122
01:14:33,731 --> 01:14:35,028
-Great to talk to you.
-Okay.

1123
01:14:35,199 --> 01:14:36,496
-Talk to you in a bit.
-Okay.

1124
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:38,828
-See you later. Yeah, great.
-Okay.

1125
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:42,038
Excuse me. Sorry.

1126
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,206
-Cal.
-Lila.

1127
01:14:49,447 --> 01:14:51,039
I thought you were in New York.

1128
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:54,447
Uh, no, Landgon's helping me
publish my novel.

1129
01:14:55,253 --> 01:14:56,720
You finished your novel.

1130
01:14:56,888 --> 01:15:01,188
I know, it's a big surprise, the, uh--
The dilettante finished something, right?

1131
01:15:01,526 --> 01:15:02,550
I never said that.

1132
01:15:03,962 --> 01:15:07,261
-What about you? Are you writing?
-Sure.

1133
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:10,401
Good. Great.

1134
01:15:11,002 --> 01:15:13,664
-I hear you're seeing someone?
-Yeah. She's here.

1135
01:15:13,839 --> 01:15:15,466
Excuse me.

1136
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:17,198
-Is she a writer?
-No.

1137
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,275
No, a painter.

1138
01:15:19,444 --> 01:15:23,471
That's great. It's very,
um, unthreatening.

1139
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,850
You think I was threatened by you?

1140
01:15:27,519 --> 01:15:29,987
No, Cal, why would you be?
You're a genius.

1141
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,295
You like my pool?

1142
01:15:39,165 --> 01:15:41,599
-Do I know you?
-I don't think so.

1143
01:15:42,201 --> 01:15:44,533
What are you doing at my party?

1144
01:15:45,438 --> 01:15:47,235
You tell me.

1145
01:15:47,507 --> 01:15:48,940
You come with someone?

1146
01:15:49,108 --> 01:15:51,406
Calvin Weir-Fields.

1147
01:15:51,577 --> 01:15:53,841
Ah, the boy wonder.

1148
01:15:54,013 --> 01:15:57,949
So are you one of those girls
who only dates famous writers?

1149
01:15:58,451 --> 01:16:00,612
Why? Are you a famous writer?

1150
01:16:01,454 --> 01:16:03,479
Do you happen to have a name?

1151
01:16:03,656 --> 01:16:07,023
-Ruby.
-Ruby.

1152
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,389
And what do you do, Ruby?

1153
01:16:10,229 --> 01:16:11,890
Nothing.

1154
01:16:13,633 --> 01:16:17,399
How refreshing.
What do you do in your spare time?

1155
01:16:20,072 --> 01:16:21,973
Not much.

1156
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:26,008
You know, I was thinking,
I was just thinking...

1157
01:16:26,179 --> 01:16:28,773
...tonight would be perfect for a swim.

1158
01:16:29,449 --> 01:16:31,417
I don't have a suit.

1159
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:34,946
Is that a problem?

1160
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:40,758
Never mind. I don't know why
I thought maybe you'd be happy for me.

1161
01:16:40,928 --> 01:16:42,793
How was I anything but supportive?

1162
01:16:42,963 --> 01:16:45,090
I read every draft.
I took you into my group.

1163
01:16:45,265 --> 01:16:47,233
-I introduced you to Langdon.
-Begrudgingly.

1164
01:16:47,401 --> 01:16:49,995
-What? I literally can't hear you.
-Begrudgingly.

1165
01:16:50,170 --> 01:16:52,297
You weren't curious about me.
You never were.

1166
01:16:52,973 --> 01:16:54,941
You just had this image of who I was.

1167
01:16:55,108 --> 01:16:58,271
And anything that I did
that contradicted it, you just ignored.

1168
01:16:58,445 --> 01:17:01,243
What image? Where you left me
as soon as I wasn't successful?

1169
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:04,714
You think I gave a shit
if you were famous?

1170
01:17:05,453 --> 01:17:08,581
All that I wanted was for you,
I don't know, to care about me.

1171
01:17:08,756 --> 01:17:11,589
Care about you?
You left weeks after my father died.

1172
01:17:11,759 --> 01:17:13,659
-Do you wanna talk about caring?
-Oh, God.

1173
01:17:13,828 --> 01:17:16,262
-Do you know what people say?
-You were impenetrable.

1174
01:17:16,431 --> 01:17:18,626
-"How'd you love that person?"
-I tried to help.

1175
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,860
-You refused to let me in.
-And I say, "l have no fucking clue!"

1176
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:31,543
The only person that you wanted to be
in a relationship with was you.

1177
01:17:33,881 --> 01:17:35,712
So I let you do that.

1178
01:17:38,419 --> 01:17:41,411
You really let yourself off the hook,
don't you?

1179
01:17:45,460 --> 01:17:46,825
-Goodbye, Cal.
-Goodbye.

1180
01:17:47,495 --> 01:17:49,429
Have a great life.

1181
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:52,166
Come on.
It's nice and warm. Swim to me.

1182
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,035
You can keep your underwear on
if you like.

1183
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:56,296
Come on in.

1184
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,270
-No peeking.
-All right, I promise, I won't peek.

1185
01:18:00,442 --> 01:18:02,205
All right.

1186
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:04,274
Mm.

1187
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,072
Oh, boy.

1188
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:12,378
Writing is sensual. It's, uh....

1189
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,322
You should see me when I write.
I'm like an Olympian.

1190
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:17,618
-Oh, really?
-I wield my pen...

1191
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,522
-Your pen?
-...Iike a lightsaber.

1192
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,493
-What's going on here?
-Calvin.

1193
01:18:22,665 --> 01:18:25,156
We, uh-- We thought we'd take a dip.

1194
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,899
Care to join us?

1195
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:43,852
-What was that?
-What was what?

1196
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,954
-You know what.
-Grow up.

1197
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:47,817
Scotty.

1198
01:18:48,258 --> 01:18:50,658
-Hey.
-Hey! You're hurting me.

1199
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,454
Explain what you were doing.

1200
01:18:52,629 --> 01:18:55,291
You left me alone at a party
where I didn't know anyone.

1201
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:58,730
-I found someone to talk to.
-In your underwear.

1202
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,234
Would you have been mad
if I had been in my bikini?

1203
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:03,099
You weren't wearing your bikini.

1204
01:19:03,273 --> 01:19:04,763
Do you know what it looked like?

1205
01:19:04,941 --> 01:19:07,205
My agent was there. My ex was there.

1206
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,101
Lila was there? Why didn't you tell me?

1207
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:12,942
I was too busy getting you
to put your clothes back on.

1208
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:15,880
-You're supposed to be my girlfriend.
-I am your girlfriend.

1209
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:17,076
So act like it.

1210
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:20,781
I'm sorry I wasn't acting
like the platonic ideal of your girlfriend.

1211
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:24,184
Jesus, you can be such a fucking prude.

1212
01:19:24,361 --> 01:19:26,261
I don't want you skinny-dipping
with men?

1213
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:29,228
Because you don't want me
doing anything!

1214
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:32,096
You have all these rules
and you don't tell me what they are...

1215
01:19:32,269 --> 01:19:34,134
...until, whoops, I've broken one.

1216
01:19:34,305 --> 01:19:36,830
And then you get to be disappointed
with me?

1217
01:19:37,007 --> 01:19:38,668
Okay. Uh, do you wanna know my rules?

1218
01:19:38,843 --> 01:19:41,937
Don't fuck other men.
Don't let them think about fucking you.

1219
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:44,047
Now I'm responsible
for what people think?

1220
01:19:44,215 --> 01:19:47,844
Yes, you are responsible. When you act
a certain way, it leads people on.

1221
01:19:48,018 --> 01:19:51,454
When you take your clothes off at a party,
people think you're a slut.

1222
01:19:51,622 --> 01:19:56,491
So I'd really prefer if you didn't do that.
Is that clear enough for you?

1223
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:58,628
Fuck you!

1224
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:04,799
I'm not your child!

1225
01:20:05,837 --> 01:20:09,000
You don't get to decide what I do.

1226
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:12,771
-Wanna bet?
-What?

1227
01:20:13,845 --> 01:20:16,837
I'm pretty sure I could make you do
whatever I want.

1228
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:21,444
What are you gonna do, Calvin?
Tie me up?

1229
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,110
No.

1230
01:20:24,523 --> 01:20:26,514
I don't have to.

1231
01:21:13,639 --> 01:21:15,300
Calvin...

1232
01:21:17,743 --> 01:21:19,938
...I'm gonna call a cab.

1233
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:24,082
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

1234
01:21:29,288 --> 01:21:31,018
Calvin.

1235
01:21:35,062 --> 01:21:38,429
Fine. Go.

1236
01:21:41,501 --> 01:21:43,230
Fuck!

1237
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,533
What was that?

1238
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:51,037
You didn't feel that?

1239
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:00,052
Aah!

1240
01:22:02,222 --> 01:22:03,985
What is that?

1241
01:22:04,157 --> 01:22:06,785
What the fuck is going on?

1242
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:09,224
Calvin.

1243
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:19,068
-Aah! Oh, my God, something is happening.
-Here. Read.

1244
01:22:34,956 --> 01:22:36,617
What is this?

1245
01:22:38,092 --> 01:22:39,821
My book.

1246
01:22:41,029 --> 01:22:43,930
The one I haven't been working on.

1247
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:46,160
Wanna see?

1248
01:22:50,772 --> 01:22:52,865
Is this some sort of joke?

1249
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:56,738
No. It's pretty serious.

1250
01:22:56,911 --> 01:22:59,346
You're writing about me?

1251
01:22:59,915 --> 01:23:03,009
No, you can't write about me.
That's private.

1252
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:06,412
I'm not writing about you.

1253
01:23:07,556 --> 01:23:09,353
I wrote you.

1254
01:23:10,092 --> 01:23:11,787
I made you up.

1255
01:23:12,895 --> 01:23:16,854
-What?
-I had a dream about a girl.

1256
01:23:18,467 --> 01:23:20,435
So I wrote it down.

1257
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,500
I gave her a name.

1258
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:26,265
Ruby.

1259
01:23:27,142 --> 01:23:32,239
I wrote all kinds of things about her
and then one day I woke up and she--

1260
01:23:32,881 --> 01:23:37,045
You were living in my house.

1261
01:23:39,788 --> 01:23:42,518
I can make you do anything...

1262
01:23:43,058 --> 01:23:45,619
...because you're not real.

1263
01:23:47,597 --> 01:23:49,656
You're sick.

1264
01:24:04,247 --> 01:24:06,010
Calvin?

1265
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:09,009
Listen to me.

1266
01:24:10,253 --> 01:24:13,416
If this is how you think about people...

1267
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:19,119
...then you are in for a long,
lonely fucked-up life.

1268
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,427
Do you hear me? Calvin?

1269
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:44,986
See. "Ruby speaks French."

1270
01:24:55,933 --> 01:24:57,924
I told you I could make you do anything.

1271
01:25:00,404 --> 01:25:01,462
I write it.

1272
01:25:04,942 --> 01:25:06,204
You do it.

1273
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:28,588
Skinnamarinky dinky dink dinky do

1274
01:25:28,967 --> 01:25:32,334
I love you

1275
01:25:32,504 --> 01:25:35,029
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

1276
01:25:35,373 --> 01:25:36,931
Dinky do

1277
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:40,010
I love you

1278
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:41,873
I love you in the morning

1279
01:26:06,839 --> 01:26:08,329
I love you.

1280
01:26:08,508 --> 01:26:10,840
I'll never leave you. I love you.

1281
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,705
I'll never leave you. I love you.

1282
01:26:12,879 --> 01:26:13,971
I'll never leave you.

1283
01:26:14,147 --> 01:26:16,980
I love you. I'll never leave you.

1284
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,845
I love your mouth. I love your nose.

1285
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:22,046
I love your butt. I love your eyes.

1286
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:24,052
I love your belly. I love your ears.

1287
01:26:24,223 --> 01:26:27,215
I love your cock. I love your nose.

1288
01:26:27,393 --> 01:26:29,486
I love your mouth. I love you so much.

1289
01:26:30,096 --> 01:26:33,588
I'll love you forever
and ever and ever and ever.

1290
01:26:34,734 --> 01:26:40,605
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

1291
01:26:40,774 --> 01:26:47,577
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

1292
01:26:47,748 --> 01:26:52,185
You're a genius.
You're a genius. You're a genius.

1293
01:26:52,352 --> 01:26:56,413
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

1294
01:26:56,590 --> 01:27:00,219
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

1295
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:15,493
Rub--

1296
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:10,669
Calvin?

1297
01:32:16,884 --> 01:32:18,408
Calvin.

1298
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:22,016
You okay?

1299
01:32:24,858 --> 01:32:26,826
She's gone.

1300
01:32:29,663 --> 01:32:31,494
She's gone.

1301
01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:37,961
It's okay, buddy.

1302
01:33:02,330 --> 01:33:03,957
Okay.

1303
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,858
Nothing helps.

1304
01:33:10,004 --> 01:33:13,633
-When was the last time you wrote, Cal?
-I can't write.

1305
01:33:14,042 --> 01:33:15,976
Sure you can.

1306
01:33:16,311 --> 01:33:20,373
That's what you have over every other poor
schmuck out there with a broken heart.

1307
01:33:20,549 --> 01:33:22,380
You can write about it.

1308
01:33:22,551 --> 01:33:24,610
And who would wanna read that?

1309
01:33:24,787 --> 01:33:26,721
Lots of people.

1310
01:33:28,290 --> 01:33:29,917
Why not?

1311
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:32,755
You got a pretty great story.

1312
01:33:32,928 --> 01:33:35,692
Everyone will think I'm crazy.

1313
01:33:36,932 --> 01:33:38,627
No.

1314
01:33:39,435 --> 01:33:41,665
They'll think it's fiction.

1315
01:34:12,335 --> 01:34:16,738
This is the true and impossible
story of my very great love.

1316
01:34:16,906 --> 01:34:20,069
In the hope that she will not read this
and reproach me...

1317
01:34:20,243 --> 01:34:22,711
...I have withheld many telling details.

1318
01:34:24,147 --> 01:34:25,375
Her name...

1319
01:34:25,548 --> 01:34:29,006
...the particulars of her birth
and upbringing...

1320
01:34:29,185 --> 01:34:32,018
...and any identifying scars
or birthmarks.

1321
01:34:33,823 --> 01:34:37,554
All the same,
I cannot help but write this for her.

1322
01:34:38,328 --> 01:34:39,693
To tell her:

1323
01:34:39,863 --> 01:34:43,390
"I'm sorry for every word
I wrote to change you.

1324
01:34:43,933 --> 01:34:46,869
I'm sorry for so many things.

1325
01:34:48,372 --> 01:34:51,205
I couldn't see you when you were here.

1326
01:34:52,576 --> 01:34:56,910
And now that you're gone,
I see you everywhere. "

1327
01:35:02,053 --> 01:35:04,419
"One may read this and think it's magic...

1328
01:35:04,588 --> 01:35:07,887
... but falling in love
is an act of magic.

1329
01:35:08,059 --> 01:35:10,084
So is writing.

1330
01:35:10,661 --> 01:35:13,027
It was once said of Catcher in the Rye:

1331
01:35:13,197 --> 01:35:16,792
'That rare miracle of fiction
has again come to pass.

1332
01:35:17,535 --> 01:35:23,906
A human being has been created
out of ink, paper and the imagination.'

1333
01:35:24,475 --> 01:35:27,069
I am no J.D. Salinger...

1334
01:35:27,411 --> 01:35:29,538
...but I have witnessed a rare miracle.

1335
01:35:31,416 --> 01:35:33,247
Any writer can attest...

1336
01:35:33,418 --> 01:35:35,750
... in the luckiest, happiest state...

1337
01:35:35,921 --> 01:35:39,789
...the words are not coming from you,
but through you.

1338
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:43,992
She came to me wholly herself.

1339
01:35:45,731 --> 01:35:49,292
I was just lucky enough to be there
to catch her."

1340
01:35:52,137 --> 01:35:53,695
Thank you.

1341
01:36:04,649 --> 01:36:08,085
Doesn't his imagination just,
uh, blow you away?

1342
01:36:08,253 --> 01:36:10,687
I mean, where does he come up
with these ideas?

1343
01:36:10,856 --> 01:36:12,448
-Right?
-Yeah.

1344
01:36:12,724 --> 01:36:14,818
-Genius.
-I don't know.

1345
01:36:15,328 --> 01:36:16,590
I don't know.

1346
01:36:16,763 --> 01:36:17,855
-How are you?
-What's up?

1347
01:36:20,867 --> 01:36:23,335
It's beautiful, Calvin.

1348
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:24,693
Thank you.

1349
01:36:24,871 --> 01:36:29,399
Most of my patients don't take
my assignments this seriously.

1350
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:34,274
I know you hoped that, by writing this,
I would realize that it never happened.

1351
01:36:34,447 --> 01:36:35,471
That I imagined her.

1352
01:36:37,583 --> 01:36:39,710
But the thing is...

1353
01:36:41,454 --> 01:36:44,252
...I don't need to make sense of this.

1354
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:49,057
I don't care
if there's no good explanation.

1355
01:36:49,796 --> 01:36:51,821
I need you to believe me anyway.

1356
01:36:53,633 --> 01:36:55,498
Just take the leap.

1357
01:36:56,169 --> 01:36:58,968
At least imagine how it could be true.

1358
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:01,236
For me.

1359
01:37:01,975 --> 01:37:03,738
I'll work on that.

1360
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:10,480
Go potty.

1361
01:37:10,984 --> 01:37:12,975
Go potty.

1362
01:37:15,055 --> 01:37:16,579
Scotty. Scotty.

1363
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:21,224
Scotty.

1364
01:37:21,995 --> 01:37:23,758
Scotty.

1365
01:37:24,431 --> 01:37:27,366
-Oh, hi.
-Sorry.

1366
01:37:27,534 --> 01:37:28,762
-Hi.
-Sorry, he's mine.

1367
01:37:28,936 --> 01:37:31,268
It's fine. He's so friendly.

1368
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:38,075
-What's his name?
-Scotty.

1369
01:37:38,245 --> 01:37:41,237
Scotty. That's funny, that's--

1370
01:37:41,415 --> 01:37:44,112
That's the name of the dog in this book.

1371
01:37:44,285 --> 01:37:45,513
Have you read it?

1372
01:37:49,090 --> 01:37:50,955
Did you like it?

1373
01:37:53,761 --> 01:37:56,025
Sorry. Did you say something?

1374
01:37:56,197 --> 01:37:58,927
Yeah, I just asked if you liked it.

1375
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:00,567
Uh, what do you think?

1376
01:38:01,336 --> 01:38:05,102
My friend who lent it to me thought
it was kind of pretentious...

1377
01:38:05,273 --> 01:38:07,537
...but I really like it so far.

1378
01:38:12,747 --> 01:38:14,977
Have we met before?

1379
01:38:17,051 --> 01:38:19,417
I don't know.

1380
01:38:20,822 --> 01:38:23,313
You seem really familiar.

1381
01:38:24,993 --> 01:38:27,519
Maybe we knew each other
in another life.

1382
01:38:27,696 --> 01:38:30,722
Or maybe we just go
to the same coffee shop.

1383
01:38:32,268 --> 01:38:35,135
What do you do
besides go for walks with your dog?

1384
01:38:36,071 --> 01:38:37,629
Um....

1385
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,365
I'm a writer.

1386
01:38:40,542 --> 01:38:42,339
What do you write?

1387
01:38:46,081 --> 01:38:48,948
So that's why you look so familiar.

1388
01:38:49,652 --> 01:38:51,051
Maybe.

1389
01:38:51,220 --> 01:38:53,780
I was kidding about
my friend calling it pretentious.

1390
01:38:53,956 --> 01:38:55,480
It's okay.

1391
01:38:59,461 --> 01:39:00,621
Can we start over?

1392
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:04,529
Yes.

1393
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:14,836
-May I sit down?
-Oh, please.

1394
01:39:28,291 --> 01:39:31,055
Just don't tell me how it ends, okay?

1395
01:39:33,463 --> 01:39:35,090
Promise.

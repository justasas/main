1
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,549
<i>Jet launch has been cancelled.</i>
<i>Clear both catapults.</i>

2
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:38,452
<i>Two flights returning. Expect</i>
<i>to recover aircraft in ten minutes.</i>

3
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,925
<i>Stand by with fire bottle</i>
<i>for helicopter turn-up.</i>

4
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,136
Shake a leg, Forney!
There are two flights coming in!

5
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,970
We're here! Keep your jumper on, sir!

6
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,239
Don't put that hat on
till you clear the deck.

7
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,407
- Captain Parker doesn't like it.
- Very well, sir.

8
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,488
<i>Prepare to launch helicopter.</i>

9
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,056
<i>Top off all jets and check Fly One</i>
<i>for ordinance load.</i>

10
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,773
<i>Launch helicopter.</i>

11
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,985
My hat and scarf, please.

12
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,813
Can't you wait
till we get off the ship?

13
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,969
- What if the captain had seen you?
- We save pilots not captains.

14
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:08,910
In the icy water, it makes them
feel good to see this hat.

15
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,074
I know that, but you're gonna get
yourself in trouble.

16
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:18,246
And another thing. Quit sassing
them officers like you just did.

17
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:24,624
You can say anything you like to them
as long as you put "sir" on the end.

18
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:32,627
<i>Take 215 and 207</i>
<i>down the deck-edge elevator.</i>

19
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,569
<i>Prepare to re-spot aircraft for recovery.</i>

20
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,644
<i>We've got two flights of jets</i>
<i>to land, low on fuel. Look alive!</i>

21
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,154
<i>Stand by to land jets.</i>

22
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,361
<i>Clear the catwalks portside aft.</i>

23
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,706
<i>Check number 6 wire.</i>
<i>The centre fiddle bridge is down.</i>

24
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,379
Let's hear the checks, boy.

25
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,548
- Wheels down.
- Wheels down.

26
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,717
- Flaps down.
- Flaps down.

27
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,046
- Hook down. All down, sir.
- All down.

28
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,621
- Clear deck.
- Clear deck.

29
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:36,091
Come on, keep your nose up
so your hook will catch. That's it.

30
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,644
Good boy.

31
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,577
202, number 3 wire. He did real good.

32
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,332
<i>Clear the catwalk aft.</i>

33
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,438
<i>211 to Bluejay. Flame-out.</i>

34
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,114
CIC is reporting an emergency, sir.

35
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,024
Go ahead, CIC.

36
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,191
<i>211 will have to ditch.</i>
<i>Will dispatch a helicopter.</i>

37
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,873
- What's his position?
- <i>18 miles out.</i>

38
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,704
- Is there another jet with him?
- Affirmative, 210, his wingman.

39
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,881
- <i>Can he ditch near the destroyers?</i>
- Negative.

40
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,709
<i>Keep me advised.</i>

41
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,408
- Have you got their position?
- Affirmative.

42
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,817
- How much fuel's the wingman got?
- 1,200 lbs.

43
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:09,325
Angel from Bluejay.
Your vector, 345 magnetic.

44
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,933
211 will have to ditch 18 miles out.
Your vector, 345 magnetic.

45
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,001
- Bluejay out.
- Bluejay from Angel. Roger.

46
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,506
210 from Bluejay. Helicopter on way.

47
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,676
- <i>What is the condition of 211?</i>
- 210 to Bluejay.

48
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,688
<i>211 is losing altitude rapidly</i>
<i>and is all set to ditch.</i>

49
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,165
210 to Bluejay. There he goes.

50
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,646
211 just ditched.
Aircraft sank immediately.

51
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,422
Pilot got out! Dye marker is visible.

52
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,094
Downed pilot afloat and in sight.

53
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,138
- <i>I'm staying here.</i>
- CIC to Flag Plot.

54
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,304
<i>210 requests permission</i>
<i>to stay with downed pilot.</i>

55
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,143
Permission granted.
Who is the pilot in the water?

56
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,320
- <i>Brubaker, sir.</i>
- Brubaker?

57
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:53,488
Just an hour ago a dispatch came in.
His wife and two kids are in Tokyo.

58
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,428
- Keep me advised on Brubaker.
- <i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

59
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,618
- Brubaker, huh?
- You know him?

60
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,582
I don't think I've seen him,
but I can describe him.

61
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,749
He's about 30, well built,
a good-looking boy with a temper.

62
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,929
That's Brubaker all right.

63
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,090
Did you ever notice the admiral takes
special interest in pilots like that?

64
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,429
Now that you mention it, yeah.

65
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,504
That's what his son
would have looked like.

66
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:40,077
<i>CIC to Flag Bridge. 210 has sighted</i>
<i>helicopter approaching.</i>

67
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,817
Tell 210 to return quickly. We can't
hold this course much longer.

68
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:01,831
Angel from 210. Come on, Forney,
I can't hold him in sight much longer.

69
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,894
210 from Angel. I see him.
Go home. Dinner's waiting.

70
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,538
Roger.

71
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,665
Jump in. I'll wait
till the <i>Hornet</i> sends a 'copter.

72
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,340
He looks froze! I'll have to go down.

73
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,778
Sorry you have to ride in the rumble, sir.

74
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:02,511
But I haven't got anybody here
to haul you in. <i>Savo</i> Angel to Bluejay.

75
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,681
<i>Two Angels coming home</i>
<i>with two frozen mackerel.</i>

76
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,231
- Admiral.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

77
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,662
Helicopter reports Brubaker aboard.

78
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,326
<i>The</i> Hornet<i>'s helicopter</i>
<i>picked up Forney's crewman.</i>

79
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,336
- Good.
- Helicopter lands in three minutes.

80
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,908
- Turn right 90 degrees.
- Aye, aye, sir.

81
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,309
Round Table, this is Jehovah.

82
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:36,477
Turn right, zero-three-five.

83
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,648
Stand by. Execute.

84
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,498
Wish you could see this, Lieutenant.
Awful pretty sight.

85
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,299
Looks like they're coming to meet us.

86
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:21,622
<i>Land the two helicopters aft</i>
<i>and stand by with a stretcher.</i>

87
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,591
<i>Keep clear of those rotors.</i>

88
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,331
<i>Clear a passage for that stretcher.</i>

89
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,617
- How are you?
- He's all right.

90
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,083
- That water's cold.
- Not when you're used to it.

91
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,485
- He's too young for brandy!
- You weren't in the water.

92
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,652
I know, but I had the hatch open.
It's awful cold in there.

93
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,371
Hello, Harry. You don't look so bad.

94
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,540
- Hi, CAG.
- How's it going?

95
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,209
I didn't know water could be so cold.

96
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,379
- Feel like talking to the admiral?
- Now?

97
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,540
Whenever you feel up to a chat.
The doctor thinks you'll be fine tonight.

98
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:51,712
- I'll send for a uniform.
- No, just come up in your robe.

99
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,893
- See you later, Harry.
- Right.

100
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,737
The admiral wants to see me.
I'm Brubaker.

101
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,569
He's in his cabin.
I'll tell him you're here.

102
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,280
<i>From Chez Paris in Chicago,</i>
<i>overlooking Lake Michigan,</i>

103
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:24,946
<i>the Armed Forces Radio Service</i>
<i>brings you the music of Henry Busse.</i>

104
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,633
This way, Lieutenant.

105
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,300
Come in.

106
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:50,641
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, come in, son.

107
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,147
- Coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

108
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,979
Sit down.

109
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,093
- How do you feel?
- I guess I'm thawed out.

110
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,755
I got the report on your ditching.
How long did it stay afloat?

111
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,869
- After one bounce I was a submarine.
- No time to get your life raft out?

112
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,599
It hooked on the seat.
I was lucky to get myself out.

113
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,371
Those helicopter boys
are pretty good fishermen.

114
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,242
They deserve every medal in the book.

115
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,344
You're out there by yourself,
you know you can't last long.

116
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,888
You're scared and freezing,
you curse and pray.

117
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,084
Suddenly you see that Mixmaster
whirling out of nowhere.

118
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:40,129
You look up and there's Forney
in his green hat.

119
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,960
You relax, 'cause you got it knocked.

120
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm mighty glad they pulled you out.
We can use you around here.

121
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,967
- Coming from you, I appreciate that.
- I mean it.

122
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,239
You fly well.
You go in low, you do your job.

123
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,090
You'd have a great future in the Navy.
Why not make it your career?

124
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:11,251
- You know what I think of the Navy.
- Still bitter, huh?

125
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,696
Say what you think. I always do.

126
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,967
Of course, I've said it
a couple of times too often.

127
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,670
The organised reserves were
drawing pay but weren't called up.

128
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,975
I was inactive and yet I was.

129
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,780
I had to give up my home,
my law practice, everything.

130
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,082
I'm still bitter.

131
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,694
So bitter I could put on an act to
the surgeon and get myself grounded.

132
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,626
Why don't you?

133
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:52,498
That's what I kept asking myself
when I was in that ice water.

134
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:58,802
You think about your friends who
are back home leading normal lives.

135
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,913
I wonder if you were back home
whether you wouldn't do the same.

136
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,414
It's not a question of indifference
but of distance.

137
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,984
They act that way
because they're there.

138
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:15,093
You go on doing your job because
you're here. It's as simple as that.

139
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,058
The progress this world has made
has always been

140
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,495
because of the efforts
and sacrifices of a few.

141
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:28,298
I was one of the few at New Guinea,
Leyte, Okinawa. Why me again?

142
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:34,002
Nobody knows why he gets
the dirty job. And this is a dirty job.

143
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,979
- Militarily, this war is a tragedy.
- We ought to pull out.

144
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:43,280
Rubbish. If we did, they'd take Japan,
Indo-China, the Philippines.

145
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,356
Where would you make a stand?
The Mississippi?

146
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,622
Men fight the wrong war in the wrong
place. The one they're stuck with.

147
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:58,792
That's why, one day, we'll knock out
those bridges at Toko-Ri.

148
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,377
- Do we have to knock them out?
- Yes, we must.

149
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,571
I believe without question,
some morning, Communist generals

150
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,182
will be meeting to discuss the war.

151
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,549
A messenger will say, "They've
knocked out the bridges at Toko-Ri!"

152
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:22,591
That mission will convince them that
we'll never weaken in our purpose.

153
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,763
That's the day they'll quit.

154
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,762
I didn't call you here
to discuss strategy

155
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,834
but to chew you out
'cause of your wife.

156
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,470
My wife?

157
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,800
- You knew she was in Japan.
- She made it!

158
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,968
- I hope she's got the kids.
- Hope you don't get a court martial.

159
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,411
- I had nothing to do with it.
- How did she get here?

160
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,517
Her father was a senator
for Massachusetts.

161
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:53,817
- I don't care if she's broken rules.
- War's no place for women.

162
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,486
I'll tell COMNAVFE you had nothing
to do with bringing her out.

163
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,666
- I'd like to meet your wife.
- It'd be a pleasure.

164
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,133
See if the surgeon can spare you
a nightcap, give you a good sleep.

165
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:10,604
In three days, you'll be in Japan.
No more take-offs for a while.

166
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,336
No, sir.
It's gonna be a long three days.

167
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,862
<i>Group one, idle.</i>

168
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,695
<i>Group two, idle.</i>

169
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,932
<i>Group one, full throttle.</i>

170
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,008
<i>Group three, full.</i>

171
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,548
Come in.

172
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,022
CAG wants to see you, Admiral.
Lee, Commander of the Air Group.

173
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,531
Send him in. Wait a minute.
What do you think of Lee?

174
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,194
He's a good man. Popular.
The pilots swear by him.

175
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,866
The personnel office are looking for
someone for higher-command training.

176
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,343
They want my opinion of Lee.
Send him in.

177
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,653
<i>Group one, full throttle.</i>

178
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,420
I received a dispatch
from COMFAIRJAP.

179
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,086
The replacement aircraft
are not available.

180
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,757
- I saw it.
- All we have is what's aboard.

181
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,437
The captain's burning up the engines.

182
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,267
- Have you talked to the captain?
- He wouldn't see me.

183
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,739
He's busy berthing the ship.

184
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,904
If he keeps doing it, sir, we won't
have any propeller planes left.

185
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,887
How would you berth a carrier
against the wind?

186
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,546
I wouldn't run a lashed-down engine
at top speed.

187
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,955
That's not fair to the pilots, sir.

188
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,198
The pinwheel operation
is necessary in this harbour.

189
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,702
There's no room for a tug. The planes
are the only way to hold us off.

190
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,707
He's been running those engines
since we hit the channel.

191
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,709
Engines are more valuable
than a carrier?

192
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,883
No, but they've only got
so many good hours.

193
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:36,043
- How long have you been in the Navy?
- 20 years, sir.

194
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:40,714
20 years. You're the commander
of the Air Group.

195
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,885
What if one of your pilots
went over your head and came to me?

196
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,555
The task-force commander
doesn't interfere with the ship.

197
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,895
But under circumstances
such as these...

198
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,902
You're coming up for promotion, Lee.

199
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,066
Captain Parker will have to turn in
a fitness report on you.

200
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,838
- Yes, sir.
- Suppose I did talk to the captain?

201
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,747
What kind of a fitness report
do you think he'd give you then?

202
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,930
It was only my point of view, sir.

203
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:23,329
I was thinking of what was best
for my pilots.

204
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:30,834
- Next time, think twice.
- Yes, sir, I will.

205
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,977
I don't like to see a young officer
going over somebody's head,

206
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,989
but I hate to see him back down
from something he believes is right.

207
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:54,655
He'll be all right for some job,
but as far as higher command goes...

208
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,027
I'll have to tell them so.

209
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,365
<i>The uniform of the day for liberty</i>
<i>is dress blue.</i>

210
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,026
<i>Liberty will expire on board</i>
<i>at 0700.</i>

211
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:39,704
- Looking for your wife, sir?
- Yeah. There she is!

212
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,989
Mrs Brubaker!

213
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,599
I got the same reception
waiting outside the gates.

214
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,607
- You married?
- Not yet. I may be after this leave.

215
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:17,248
<i>Liberty party fall in. Muster</i>
<i>on the flight deck for inspection!</i>

216
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,979
Lower away. Easy!

217
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,648
All right, men.
Open up, front and centre.

218
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,320
- Beer Barrel, what's your handicap?
- I only have two hands.

219
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:38,162
- I can't lift beer mugs fast enough.
- Do you need a caddie?

220
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,362
You bet. After the first nine steins,
they get heavy.

221
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,269
Permission to leave the ship, sir.

222
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,985
Darling, darling!

223
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,320
- Where are the kids?
- It was too long a trip for them.

224
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,202
- How long is your leave?
- A week. Are the kids OK?

225
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:15,703
Fine. I found a wonderful Japanese
nurse. They're dying to see you.

226
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,787
Have your liberty cards ready.

227
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,640
Have your liberty cards ready.

228
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:02,249
There she is, Nestor.
Hey, Kimiko! Your man's back.

229
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,650
Not so fast. Things are different.
We got to talk.

230
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,422
All right, let's find some cosy nook
where we can talk.

231
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,535
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

232
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,041
Kathy! Susie!

233
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:05,315
- We saw you getting out of the car!
- You did? They've gotten so big!

234
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,816
- This is Setsuko, Daddy.
- How are you?

235
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,488
- Have they been good?
- Oh, yes.

236
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,158
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

237
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,040
Thank you.

238
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,044
Daddy, Daddy! I want to show you
the fish pond.

239
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:42,208
Take your sweater off and put it in
the closet. See that Susie does, too.

240
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:55,031
Daddy, Daddy! I want to show you
the funny bed I sleep in.

241
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,303
OK, young lady, you show me.

242
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,974
Why don't you leave me alone?

243
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:12,138
When I've those paddles in my hands,
I have enough to worry about.

244
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,650
When I get ashore,
I don't wanna worry about anything.

245
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:22,316
One thing does worry me, though.
Have they got enough beer in Japan?

246
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:27,064
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening, Admiral.

247
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:33,096
- How's the family?
- Fine, thank you, sir.

248
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,273
- This is Mrs Brubaker, Nancy.
- How do you do?

249
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:40,433
Your husband took off like a jet
when he heard you were here.

250
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,545
- Now I understand why.
- Thank you.

251
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:47,616
- I was pleased to see him, too.
- Won't you sit down, sir?

252
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,778
- They didn't keep you in Tokyo long.
- They don't any more.

253
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,584
Not since that first press conference.

254
00:29:55,994 --> 00:30:01,626
I told them we were fighting Russian
guns, radar, planes and submarines.

255
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,463
Our men were being killed by Russian
equipment manned by Russian experts.

256
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,301
Ever since then, they've bundled me
out here as fast as possible.

257
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:16,310
- I'm Brubaker.
- Gentleman to see you, sir.

258
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,981
Excuse me.

259
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,651
- Have a drink.
- Doctor won't let me.

260
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,149
- What is it, Nestor?
- Mike's been in a fight.

261
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,329
- Just Mike?
- No, sir.

262
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,158
I got away. Mike's in jail in Tokyo.

263
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,392
- I came as quick as I could.
- What happened?

264
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:42,164
His girl's marrying a bosun
from the <i>Essex.</i>

265
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:45,831
If you don't come,
he'll be locked up permanent.

266
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:51,243
Nestor, Tokyo is 60 miles away.
I'll phone the MPs.

267
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:56,546
Mike clobbered two MPs,
along with the gang from the <i>Essex.</i>

268
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:03,592
- Did you two take on the whole town?
- Yes, sir. Practically.

269
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:10,623
- I'd like to do something...
- Please, you gotta help Mike.

270
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,300
OK, I'll come. You wait here.

271
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,643
There's been some trouble in Tokyo.

272
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,307
- What kind of trouble?
- Mike Forney again.

273
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,819
A girl, another sailor, a brawl,
usual consequences. He's in jail.

274
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,720
You don't have to get mixed up in it.

275
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,886
Darling, if Forney were in China
I'd have to help him.

276
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,032
Harry!

277
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:00,342
If you were freezing to death
in the sea and a man rescued you,

278
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,952
wouldn't you help that man
if he got in trouble?

279
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:08,114
- Did Harry crash at sea?
- Yes, four days ago.

280
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,625
You know your husband's at war,

281
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:20,031
but you can't believe
that he'd crash into the sea.

282
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:25,642
- Hasn't he told you what he's doing?
- He never talks about the war.

283
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,802
With the rest of them,
he's been doing a tough job well.

284
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,609
When we go back to sea,
he's got a tougher one ahead of him.

285
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:39,654
He's going to have to fly against
some... certain bridges.

286
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:45,989
- Ask him to tell you about them.
- I don't want to think about it.

287
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,826
I suppose to you
it's a sign of weakness.

288
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,002
Maybe not weakness.

289
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,898
Like most people at home, you're
protected, ignorant and defenceless.

290
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:02,944
- Harry doesn't want me to worry.
- That's the way my son George felt.

291
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,115
Harry reminds me of him.

292
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:09,275
The quick temper
and the thorough way of doing things.

293
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,515
In certain ways, you remind me
a little of George's wife.

294
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,455
She didn't want to think about it
either, is that it?

295
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,296
When George was killed at Midway,
she never recovered.

296
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,463
She tried to make love
with every man in uniform.

297
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,644
Thought he might die one day.

298
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,643
She grew to loathe herself
and attempted suicide.

299
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,978
I don't know where she is
or what she's doing.

300
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,644
Once she was... my son's wife.

301
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:53,657
And you think, if things go wrong
at those bridges, I might be like that?

302
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:59,462
Perhaps, if you don't let yourself
think about certain things.

303
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,767
If you refuse to acknowledge things,
terrible consequences can follow.

304
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,104
I shouldn't have come.
That's what you're trying to tell me.

305
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:14,547
No. In spite of all the regulations,
maybe you were right to come.

306
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,347
Perhaps when George was killed,
if my wife had joined me,

307
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,047
things might have been different.

308
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,286
But she stayed at home,
like a good Navy wife.

309
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,960
When our other boy was killed,
it was just too much for her.

310
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:37,498
- You lost two sons and your wife?
- No.

311
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,176
Margaret is still alive.

312
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:47,641
But all that was gentle and loving
about her slowly withered away.

313
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:55,990
Now she sits quietly alone in a room,
knitting a baby's sweater.

314
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:04,195
- Admiral, I'm so ashamed.
- Don't be.

315
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:09,704
Just be grateful for what you have.
Above all, be honest with yourself.

316
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,536
If I can't face the reality now,

317
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:21,783
there won't be much hope for me
afterward if anything should happen.

318
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,614
I have a feeling you'll be all right.

319
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,281
Let's get your little girls
and have dinner.

320
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,656
Come on, Nestor.

321
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:10,093
Major, I'm Lieutenant Brubaker.
You have a chief here called Forney.

322
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:14,260
- I'd like to get him out.
- I wish I could help you.

323
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,873
But your wild Irishman
just wrecked a dance hall.

324
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,276
He also saved the lives
of four pilots.

325
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:28,783
I got a lot of monsters in that cage.
Every one was a hero in Korea.

326
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,285
But here in Tokyo,
they're all monsters.

327
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,722
Forney's a helicopter pilot.
I had to ditch my plane at sea.

328
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,625
These two saved my life.
This man jumped into the ocean.

329
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:45,291
I suppose his face got chopped up
that way by the waves?

330
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,804
- I know there was a brawl...
- A brawl?

331
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:54,637
A brawl is when six guys
get to throwing punches.

332
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,474
These two monsters
took on half of Tokyo.

333
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:05,422
- Are you married, Major?
- Yes.

334
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:10,583
We got in at noon today. I haven't
seen my wife and kids for a year.

335
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,754
I left them and came up here
to get Mike out of jail.

336
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:17,935
That's what I think of these two men.

337
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:24,968
Are you willing to cough up 80 bucks
for the damage he did?

338
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:31,137
- I'd pay 800 if I had to.
- OK, Sergeant, drag Forney out here.

339
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,048
Sign here. He's yours,
but you're not getting any bargain.

340
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,791
I knew you could do it, Lieutenant.

341
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:50,695
- Thanks, Major. Come on.
- Don't let them get away from you.

342
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:54,894
There are parts of Tokyo
comparatively unharmed yet.

343
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:11,747
- Lieutenant...
- You are going back to Yokosuka.

344
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:16,256
You gotta talk to Kimiko. She can't
marry that ape from the <i>Essex.</i>

345
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,590
She'll listen to you, Lieutenant.
Please do me this one favour.

346
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,927
- Where is she?
- Follow me, sir.

347
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:06,569
- You're not supposed to be here.
- It's all right, he's with me.

348
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,769
Lieutenant, there she is!

349
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,111
Kimiko, this is Lieutenant Brubaker.

350
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:53,654
I wondered whether any girl
warranted a riot. You do.

351
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,521
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- He wants to talk to you.

352
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,060
I'm very sorry, Lieutenant.

353
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:04,166
While Mike at sea,
I lose my heart to <i>Essex</i> man.

354
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,064
<i>Essex</i>... not at sea.

355
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,739
But you couldn't do better than Mike.

356
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,640
I know. Mike good man.
But I lose my heart, Lieutenant.

357
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:18,974
Not in my dress, you don't!

358
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,479
Lieutenant,
she cost me two months' pay!

359
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,025
- Hey, Mike.
- What is it?

360
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:32,684
What's going on over there?
Break it up!

361
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:38,025
Get out of the way, fellas.
Break it up.

362
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,972
Break it up! What's going on here?

363
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,853
I'll guess you'll live.

364
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,621
- Kimiko!
- Don't worry, I'll get him back.

365
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:06,354
- Kimiko, that's my girl!
- We're going back to the ship.

366
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,191
Kimiko!

367
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,817
- I'm sorry, darling.
- It's all right.

368
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:40,828
- Did you get him out of jail?
- Yes, I got him out.

369
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,997
Admiral Tarrant told me
about Mike Forney.

370
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,675
I wish he hadn't.

371
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:06,011
Don't worry. I've had it now.
No one ever crashes twice.

372
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:11,525
Harry, what are the bridges
you have to bomb when you go back?

373
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,698
Tell me about the bridges, darling.

374
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:21,627
Kathy and Susie ought to have piano
lessons when they get a bit older.

375
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:28,634
I was thinking the same thing
just the other day.

376
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,718
I always wanted to learn.
Never got around to it.

377
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,656
Same here.
They say if you start young enough...

378
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:45,317
- They've got new methods now.
- I know.

379
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:50,364
Mildred Porter learned in a few
months. Even after five weeks...

380
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,527
Harry, you've got to tell me
about those bridges!

381
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:15,850
The bridges span a narrow gap
between two mountains.

382
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,996
It's one of the most important
targets in Korea.

383
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:24,429
Consequently,
it's fortified accordingly.

384
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,264
Although we're only over the target
about 30 seconds...

385
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,469
...it's a lifetime.

386
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:37,306
Every kind of gun imaginable
is hidden in those mountains.

387
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:44,213
The men behind the guns know
where we're coming from and headed.

388
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,250
They know we're not going to fly
above the mountains.

389
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,431
We're going to fly between them.

390
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:59,033
We're coming in low and straight.

391
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:02,205
There's no room to twist or duck.

392
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,941
And there's no surprising them.

393
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,312
They're just sitting there,

394
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,813
waiting for us...

395
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,546
...hoping we'll come.

396
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,453
That's Toko-Ri, Nancy.

397
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:33,293
- I'm glad you told me.
- Does it help?

398
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,472
I think so.

399
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:42,202
You didn't want to tell me
because you didn't want me to worry.

400
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:46,372
I don't want you to worry either.
About me, I mean.

401
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,922
I know what the admiral
was trying to tell me.

402
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:57,321
I had to face those bridges, too.

403
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:04,558
Well, I have.
And I'll be all right now.

404
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,939
- I'm going to swim across the pool!
- So am I!

405
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:24,120
- I'm not so sure about this.
- Don't be silly.

406
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,954
You go in there. I'll go in here.

407
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:36,258
You get in the pool first. We're not
coming out until the coast is clear.

408
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,300
OK, you modest violets.

409
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,640
- Why does the water taste so funny?
- It's mineral water from the spring.

410
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,145
- Watch me swim, Daddy.
- OK.

411
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,047
That's fine, Kathy.

412
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,486
- Are you sure that door's locked?
- Absolutely.

413
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,355
- Watch me swim, too, Daddy.
- OK, Susie.

414
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:17,899
Hey, this is private!
We had it reserved!

415
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,009
No, private, reserved.

416
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:32,016
Number one, good morning.

417
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:36,318
No, you don't understand.
We had it reserved, the whole pool.

418
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,354
- No!
- Harry, do something!

419
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,832
- What can I do?
- Take a deep breath.

420
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:14,590
That means "good morning"
in Japanese.

421
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,631
- Belong you?
- Yes.

422
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,167
Belong me.

423
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:26,199
- Keiko. Takako.
- I'm Kathy.

424
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,378
I'm Susie!

425
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,247
Happy family.

426
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,620
Yes, happy family!

427
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:04,108
This is Tilly. She picks up aircraft
off the deck if they lose a wheel.

428
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:09,274
- Why do they call her Tilly?
- Why do they call you Nancy?

429
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,179
<i>The ship will get under way</i>
<i>in 45 minutes.</i>

430
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:19,351
<i>Visitors are requested</i>
<i>to be off the ship in 15 minutes.</i>

431
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:26,102
<i>The officer of the deck</i>
<i>is shifting his watch to the bridge.</i>

432
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,814
Here comes Beer Barrel.

433
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:43,612
Hey, what was your score,
Beer Barrel?

434
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,845
What's par for the cruise?

435
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:50,493
- Pull your flaps up, boy.
- You sure are overloaded.

436
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,493
Report my return aboard, sir.

437
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:58,964
- Get refuelled, Beer Barrel.
- Report my return aboard, sir.

438
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,247
Can I help you with those, sir?

439
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,453
Thanks, but this is a man's work.

440
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:30,764
We've got a few minutes yet.
That's Mike Forney.

441
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,598
- Green scarf?
- Yeah.

442
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:42,041
I never knew there were
so many beautiful girls.

443
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:47,342
- We cornered the market.
- Best thing for you was losing Kimiko.

444
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,954
You're a wise man.
There she is, girls.

445
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:56,114
The <i>Savo,</i> the greatest flat top
in the fleet.

446
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,055
What is this ship?

447
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,033
That? That's the <i>Essex.</i>

448
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:16,034
Not here, Mike!
There's too much brass and SPs!

449
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,316
You're right.

450
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,486
She ain't worth it. What's one girl?

451
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,004
The flower of Japan.

452
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,498
The pride of the fleet, my lad.
The best man won.

453
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,410
- Thank you.
- Bless you, my children.

454
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,614
Forney's at it again!

455
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:05,192
- Chico's in a fight!
- Swing at me and I'll flatten you!

456
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,592
- Kill that little shrimp!
- He started it!

457
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:12,758
- Gimme a hand!
- Who do you think you're hitting?

458
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,028
This ain't no place for a lady.

459
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:18,867
- Come on, we need you!
- Charlie, come on!

460
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:26,444
- What's going on here?
- Break it up. Back to the ship.

461
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,146
Get on board or we'll run you in.

462
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,517
- Let's go.
- Come on, back to the ship.

463
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:39,525
And that's the man you spent
half the night getting out of jail?

464
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,027
Yes, and I'd do it again.

465
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,619
Although we're going out
to get new pictures,

466
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:21,855
this photo will give you some idea
of how rough this mission will be.

467
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:26,525
To determine the tactical approach,
I'll get the pre-strike photos.

468
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:32,697
Brubaker, you'll fly cover for me.
Stay at least 3,000 feet above me.

469
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:37,039
Keep away from even altitudes.
Makes it tougher on the gunners.

470
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:41,877
We'll take off in an hour.
All right, Martin, you've got it.

471
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:50,982
Boy, what a spot to take pictures.
I want bombs, not cameras.

472
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,163
<i>All cameras ready.</i>

473
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:57,824
<i>Clear port and starboard catwalks</i>
<i>forward.</i>

474
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,837
<i>Prepare to launch</i>
<i>photographic mission.</i>

475
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,802
<i>Launch jets.</i>

476
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:17,766
Bluejay, this is Peter Peter 21.
My feet are dry.

477
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,033
Crossing first checkpoint.

478
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:37,520
There's our second checkpoint.
Town of Majon-ni.

479
00:57:08,491 --> 00:57:10,584
Just passed Yangdok.

480
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,825
Target 15 miles ahead.

481
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:32,445
Remember, CAG, all you got
is a camera. Get in and get out.

482
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,745
I'm only gonna take their pictures.
But watch how mad they get.

483
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,717
Commencing run.

484
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,634
I've seen it rough, CAG,
but that was the roughest.

485
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:46,619
- You all right?
- I think so. I could have been hit.

486
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:51,453
My tail-hook position light came on.
Drop down, look me over.

487
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,582
- Nothing visible.
- Good. Mission completed.

488
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,084
Returning to carrier.

489
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,435
Real estate looks better going home.

490
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:55,886
<i>Stand by to land jet aircraft.</i>

491
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,291
- Wheels down.
- Wheels down.

492
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,126
- Flaps down.
- Flaps down.

493
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:39,961
- Hook down.
- Hook down.

494
01:00:40,169 --> 01:00:44,128
- All down, sir. Clear deck.
- Clear deck.

495
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,943
<i>Clear deck. Land aircraft.</i>

496
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,618
Nice going, CAG. Roger pass.

497
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,462
Clear the deck!

498
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:16,739
<i>Stand by to rig a new barricade.</i>

499
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,995
I'm all right.

500
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:54,534
Bluejay to 209er. Foul deck.
Peter Peter 21 crashed. He's OK.

501
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:59,078
- <i>What is your state?</i>
- Fuel critical.

502
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:03,150
- Only 650 Ibs remaining.
- <i>Barrier being repaired.</i>

503
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:07,345
- <i>Estimate ten-minute delay.</i>
- I'll be out of fuel.

504
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:11,687
- <i>How about the</i> Hornet<i>?</i>
- <i>Hornet</i> not spotted for recovery.

505
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,421
- Orbit ship.
- Roger.

506
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,961
<i>Get that barrier cleared</i>
<i>and that plane out of there.</i>

507
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:31,644
<i>Man Tilly.</i>
<i>Barricade is not repairable.</i>

508
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,908
<i>Tilly will be used</i>
<i>to protect planes forward.</i>

509
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:44,887
I've only got 450 Ibs. I don't want
to go into the sea again.

510
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,127
<i>Position Tilly</i>
<i>in the number-three barrier spot.</i>

511
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,008
- <i>On the double!</i>
- <i>Impossible to repair barrier.</i>

512
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:14,178
<i>Must use Tilly to protect planes forward.</i>
<i>Deck is pitching badly.</i>

513
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:18,019
<i>Do you wish to attempt deck landing</i>
<i>or to ditch?</i>

514
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,525
I'll come aboard.

515
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,298
If he doesn't make it the first time,
he'll have to ditch.

516
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,477
I'll bring him in
if Tilly doesn't bother him.

517
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,475
<i>Stand by.</i>

518
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:46,012
<i>All personnel, clear the deck aft.</i>
<i>Stand by with crash equipment.</i>

519
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,264
Bring me in, Beer Barrel.
No wave-off.

520
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:04,031
Come on. I know the deck's dancing
but you got to make it this time.

521
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:27,258
<i>All planes aboard.</i>
<i>Continue clearing barrier.</i>

522
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:32,298
<i>Strike Peter Peter 21 below</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

523
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:58,658
<i>Commence refuelling. The smoking</i>
<i>lamp is out throughout the ship.</i>

524
01:05:02,632 --> 01:05:05,430
You'd better not fly for a few days.

525
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:09,127
I'm all right, thanks.
This is all I needed.

526
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,772
- Are they moving you, Doc?
- Not me.

527
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,075
We're sending medical supplies
to the destroyer.

528
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:26,278
She's coming to pick up
Forney and Gamidge.

529
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:30,550
- Forney and Gamidge?
- Captain's having them transferred.

530
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,220
They're going to the helicopter scow
at Yodo Island.

531
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:05,720
- So long, Gamidge. Good luck.
- Thanks. Same to you, sir.

532
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,890
Watch out, Nestor.
Don't get your feet wet.

533
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,103
You're liable to catch cold!

534
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,668
So long, Lieutenant.
We'll send you the 80 bucks.

535
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,241
Good luck, Nestor!

536
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:42,225
They want us to fly behind enemy
lines three times a day after meals.

537
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,956
I don't mind, though. I hate Commies.

538
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,795
Take care. Pilots need men like you.

539
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,972
Thank you, sir.

540
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:55,633
If you ever have to ditch around
Wonsan Harbour, we'll fish you out.

541
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,339
You look edgy. You know what
I used to do when I got jittery?

542
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:04,041
I'd walk out on deck and
let the spray hit me in the kisser.

543
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:08,212
- Used to fix me up every time.
- Forney, let's go.

544
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,563
Try it some time.

545
01:07:40,656 --> 01:07:43,523
The two stone bridges
offer the best targets.

546
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,422
You'll also have to hit the low ones.

547
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,087
We'll give you your checkpoints
tomorrow.

548
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:54,759
Your secondary target
will be this fuel dump at Tokch'on.

549
01:07:54,970 --> 01:08:00,909
We've hit it before, but there's new
activity in the area. Any questions?

550
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:05,444
Yes, about Toko-Ri. Where is
the heaviest concentration of flak?

551
01:08:05,648 --> 01:08:09,379
Here are the shots
from my wing camera.

552
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:12,013
Does that answer your question?

553
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,448
The flight will have three divisions.

554
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:24,285
We'll approach from the west
and attack three times.

555
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,792
Martin, take your jets in
to suppress flak.

556
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,988
I'll follow on the western bridges.

557
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:35,000
Brubaker, your division will take
the two bridges to the east.

558
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:37,866
Roy, you'll be the last man down.

559
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,940
Give a damage report
after each attack.

560
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:45,978
Take-off will be at 1500,
so we'll have the sun at our backs.

561
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:51,953
Any questions?

562
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,657
<i>We're back in the broadcasting room</i>
<i>on a sunny day in Los Angeles.</i>

563
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:08,359
<i>The temperature's in the 80s.</i>

564
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,870
<i>The fans are getting the thrill</i>
<i>of their lives.</i>

565
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,043
<i>The Rams trail the 49ers by six points.</i>

566
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:20,238
<i>The winner meets Cleveland</i>
<i>for the title. The Rams line up.</i>

567
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,384
<i>Van Brocklin drops back to pass.</i>
<i>He gets good protection.</i>

568
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:29,491
<i>It's a long one to Fears.</i>
<i>He's dropped on the six-yard line...</i>

569
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,015
<i>Dear Nancy,</i>

570
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:07,345
<i>these will probably be</i>
<i>the last words...</i>

571
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,689
<i>... you will ever receive from me.</i>

572
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,188
<i>Dear Nancy,</i>

573
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:48,385
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>how wonderful it was to see you.</i>

574
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,872
<i>I will never forget</i>
<i>the picture of you...</i>

575
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:04,278
<i>... standing there on the dock</i>
<i>as we came in.</i>

576
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:22,953
- What are you doing?
- I was writing a letter to Nancy.

577
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,760
- I can't sleep with this racket.
- I've noticed that, too.

578
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:32,635
It always seems louder before
you go out on a mission. You all right?

579
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,800
Harry, this is an important mission,
very important.

580
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,971
We've got to do a first-rate job.
I can't take chances.

581
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,650
I know.

582
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,048
A guy comes clean
and grounds himself, I'm grateful.

583
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:51,659
If he bluffs it out and endangers
an entire mission, it's unforgivable.

584
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,828
Think it over, Harry.

585
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,848
<i>Pilots, man planes.</i>

586
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,895
<i>Pilots, man planes.</i>

587
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,639
<i>Stand by to start jet engines.</i>

588
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,683
<i>Launch jets.</i>

589
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:37,968
Flight from CAG. Target dead ahead.
Prepare to attack.

590
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,651
<i>205 to CAG.</i>
<i>Commencing flak-suppression run.</i>

591
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:20,237
- 212 from Zero Zero.
- <i>This is 212. Damage report follows.</i>

592
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:24,407
<i>Three bridges down.</i>
<i>One railway bridge intact.</i>

593
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,247
It looked like direct hits on all.

594
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:31,414
- <i>Negative.</i>
- Stand by for second attack.

595
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:44,468
CAG to Flight.
Commencing second attack.

596
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:30,306
All bridges down! Nice going, CAG!

597
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:34,477
<i>CAG to Flight.</i>
<i>Proceed to secondary target.</i>

598
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:08,345
CAG to Flight. Secondary target
below. Commencing first run.

599
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:07,576
210 from 209er.
I think I just took a hit.

600
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:20,628
210 from 209er. I just took a hit.
Where are you?

601
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,788
<i>Harry, this is CAG.</i>
<i>210 must have radio failure.</i>

602
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,959
<i>I have you in sight.</i>
<i>I'll be with you in a minute.</i>

603
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,656
No visible damage.
Vapour coming from your fuselage.

604
01:23:55,864 --> 01:24:01,962
- Could be hydraulic fluid or fuel.
- RPM surging. Everything else is OK.

605
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:17,682
CAG to 205. Martin, take over.
I'm staying with Brubaker.

606
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:23,188
<i>CAG from 205. Roger. Will stay above</i>
<i>and keep you in sight.</i>

607
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:29,694
I was worried for a minute. I thought
I might have to land. I'll make it.

608
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:43,037
- <i>Brubaker from CAG. What state?</i>
- Fuel OK. 2,000 Ibs.

609
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,509
Keep checking.
Hydraulic fluid would be gone by now.

610
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,276
- Can you still see vapour?
- <i>Yes. Don't your gauges show it?</i>

611
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,886
- Can't tell.
- <i>You'll make it to the sea.</i>

612
01:24:54,089 --> 01:25:00,221
Wonsan Harbour's just over the ridge.
The helicopter scow will pick you up.

613
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,056
Yeah, sure, I'll make it.

614
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:13,633
I'm losing fuel fast. Down to 1,600 Ibs.

615
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,470
<i>You'd better call the word now.</i>

616
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:30,891
You'd better call the scow.

617
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:36,724
Yeah. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

618
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:46,630
<i>This is 209er. RDF call.</i>
<i>35 miles north-west Wonsan.</i>

619
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,811
<i>Flak damage. Losing fuel rapidly.</i>

620
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,604
Let's go, Nestor.

621
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,011
Alligator 1 to 209er.
Give me a call for a bearing.

622
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:01,748
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>
<i>Prepare helicopter for launch.</i>

623
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:12,690
<i>1- 2-3-4-4-3.</i>

624
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,803
<i>Launch helicopter.</i>

625
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,488
<i>Bluejay, Bluejay.</i>
<i>This is Alligator 1.</i>

626
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:51,195
- This is Bluejay. Go ahead.
- <i>209er has had an emergency.</i>

627
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:56,742
<i>He bears 330 degrees,</i>
<i>35 miles from Wonsan.</i>

628
01:26:56,945 --> 01:27:00,176
Air Op, CIC. We have an emergency.

629
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:11,655
- Can't last much longer, CAG.
- You're doing fine. You'll make it.

630
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,191
Fuel tank's empty. I've had it.

631
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,278
You can make it.

632
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:39,782
I can glide to the water
if I can clear the ridge.

633
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,475
Can't make it.

634
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:13,586
- <i>What are you gonna do?</i>
- Crash.

635
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,949
They love to fire at parachutes.

636
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:18,455
Alligator 1, this is Zero Zero.

637
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:23,120
209er crash-landing,
bearing 335 degrees.

638
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:27,290
- 25 miles from Yodo Island.
- <i>Roger your transmission.</i>

639
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:32,804
<i>Trying to divert aircraft to crash</i>
<i>for rescap protection of pilot.</i>

640
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,608
- There's a clearing ahead.
- I see it.

641
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:45,445
Looks like an irrigation ditch alongside.

642
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:49,350
<i>Land near it.</i>
<i>Get out fast. Make for that ditch.</i>

643
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,318
- Hit every item on your checklist.
- <i>I'm doing that now.</i>

644
01:28:55,530 --> 01:29:00,968
<i>Tighten your shoulder straps</i>
<i>as tight as you can stand them.</i>

645
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:04,605
- I can hardly breathe.
- <i>Gun?</i>

646
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,435
I've got one. Not that I've ever used it.

647
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,694
How does the field look, Harry?

648
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:33,162
- You pick 'em real good.
- Jettison your canopy.

649
01:29:36,337 --> 01:29:40,797
<i>Get out fast, Harry. No matter</i>
<i>what happens, get out fast.</i>

650
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:37,237
Forney!

651
01:34:56,691 --> 01:34:58,158
Nestor!

652
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,028
Nestor!

653
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,968
They was gonna give Nestor a medal.

654
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,289
How much longer can them ADs stay?

655
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:07,917
Not very long. They must be
running out of ammunition.

656
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:13,194
They won't send another 'copter now,
not after dark.

657
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:17,530
If we can hold out, they'll find us
in the morning. Take this.

658
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:26,545
Just release the safety and squeeze
the trigger. It fires automatic.

659
01:36:26,747 --> 01:36:30,410
I'm a lawyer.
I probably can't hit a thing.

660
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:36,448
How did you get out here
in a smelly ditch in Korea?

661
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:39,751
That's what I've been asking myself.

662
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,425
Better get these things off.
Too good a target.

663
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:41,016
"You're stuck with
the wrong war in the wrong place."

664
01:37:41,222 --> 01:37:43,713
What did you say, Lieutenant?

665
01:37:43,924 --> 01:37:47,451
You ever hear Admiral Tarrant
talk about this war?

666
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:50,528
About the few who lay it on the line?

667
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,996
Nestor and me never fraternised
with admirals.

668
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:03,636
I can see now he was right.
You fight simply because you're here.

669
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:56,563
Watch out, Lieutenant!

670
01:39:54,254 --> 01:39:57,712
- Where's Lee?
- On the bridge, sir.

671
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:08,700
- <i>Admiral from CIC.</i>
- Go ahead.

672
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:12,861
<i>Just received final report,</i>
<i>authenticated by Army Intelligence.</i>

673
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:17,510
<i>Jet aircraft crashed.</i>
<i>Helicopter shot down.</i>

674
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:21,545
<i>Three Americans killed</i>
<i>by Communist troops.</i>

675
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:32,985
- Why was Brubaker abandoned?
- We stayed as long as we could.

676
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,991
Why didn't you call
another helicopter?

677
01:40:36,196 --> 01:40:40,826
I called in the downed-pilot report.
I had to leave. My fuel was low.

678
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,664
The first helicopter hadn't arrived.
There was nothing I could do.

679
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:48,865
- Was Brubaker hit at the bridges?
- No, at our secondary target.

680
01:40:49,076 --> 01:40:52,341
We had bombs,
so we went to the fuel dump.

681
01:40:52,546 --> 01:40:57,677
- Was that good judgment?
- Admiral, we did everything right.

682
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:03,448
I put Brubaker in charge of the division
because I knew he'd fly low.

683
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:07,753
I don't care what fitness report
you give me. It was a good mission!

684
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:13,456
It cost the lives of three men.
Forney, Gamidge and Brubaker.

685
01:41:14,334 --> 01:41:19,465
I know how you feel. But what makes
you think you're the only one.

686
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:24,838
He may have been your boy, Admiral,
but he was my boy, too. I lost him.

687
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:41,623
You're right, CAG. You're right.

688
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:02,615
I was wrong about CAG, Evans.
He's a good man. A good man.

689
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:07,948
I'd like to write Brubaker's wife,
but what can you say?

690
01:42:08,155 --> 01:42:12,216
How can you explain this
to the mother of two little girls?

691
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:15,054
<i>Prepare to launch jets.</i>

692
01:42:18,332 --> 01:42:20,960
Where do we get such men?

693
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:26,298
They leave this ship
and they do their job.

694
01:42:27,674 --> 01:42:32,634
Then they must find this speck
lost somewhere on the sea.

695
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:37,806
When they find it,
they have to land on its pitching deck.

696
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:43,854
- Where do we get such men?
- <i>Launch jets.</i>

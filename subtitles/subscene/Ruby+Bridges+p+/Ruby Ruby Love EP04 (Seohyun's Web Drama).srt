00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,120
I'm not perfect at Korean, but I'm better than nothing, right?

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,360
Ruby Ruby Love

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,340
Opal, the Gem of Bad Luck

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,680
am I going crazy?

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,800
Get it together, Ruby!

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,739
Are you zoning out?

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,260
omo!

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,339
you scared me!

10
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,800
I have something for you-

11
00:00:57,60 --> 00:00:57,640
what?

12
00:00:59,80 --> 00:01:01,80
oh, put out your hand

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
It's Opal

14
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,940
wow, it's so pretty!

15
00:01:14,80 --> 00:01:14,820
But...

16
00:01:16,60 --> 00:01:17,460
Why are you giving me this?

17
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,660
what do you mean?

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,660
Opal

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,339
The Gem of bad luck

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,500
By chance- are you trying to give me bad luck?

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,880
By giving me the icon of bad luck?

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,420
Aigoo- you're superstitious

23
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,40
It's just a superstition!

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,480
There's no proof at all

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,100
Actually, Opal has a very different meaning-

26
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,20
Ah, Just a sec

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,940
Hello?

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:45,800
Yes

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,880
What?

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:48,920
I'll be right there!

31
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,420
what is it?

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,360
What happened?

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,760
Wondol-

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,20
What am I gonna do?

35
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,660
This is your design!

36
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,60
Ma'am you can't sell this here!

37
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,120
Why are you yelling at me?

38
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,440
I bought these from someone!

39
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,880
I have no idea what you're even talking about

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,440
How did this happen?

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,20
Director!

42
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,60
Team leader!

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,60
seriously-

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,500
How could Ruby do this?

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,480
Omo

46
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,739
Team Leader!

47
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,420
Ruby didn't do this!

48
00:02:40,40 --> 00:02:40,540
But-

49
00:02:41,20 --> 00:02:43,20
Her showcase is in a week so-

50
00:02:43,20 --> 00:02:44,900
What can we do?

51
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,480
A week?

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,740
Hey-

53
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,480
Who is that?

54
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,100
what are you talking about? it's Ru-

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,940
It's in a week? I'll call Ruby and tell her

56
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,400
but-

57
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,260
Mom

58
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,40
It looks like I messed things up

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
you bought that design?

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,80
Do you remember who sold it to you?

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,000
I didn't get their name

62
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,740
by chance-

63
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,940
was it this person?

64
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
So she really isn't going to do it?

65
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,340
Right-

66
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,200
You know that Ruby has agoraphobia

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
She really can't do the modelling?

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
No. It's just not possible

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,340
Ah, what a shame

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
How can she waste an opportunity like this?

71
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,440
Fine

72
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,620
That's just how it is

73
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Okay, I'll call you back

74
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,280
Ruby! Lee Roo!

75
00:05:16,20 --> 00:05:16,780
Lee Ruby!

76
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,840
What are you doing?

77
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,520
Are you really going to give up like this?

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,500
This is such a good opportunity-

79
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,300
Well, what do you want me to do?

80
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,900
The concept, design, production- that all takes about a month!

81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,580
How am I supposed to do that in a week?

82
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,520
I will help you!

83
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,539
It's fine- don't

84
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,520
I mean, you can't

85
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,920
It's not possible. Now, give that back!

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,680
Ruby- Ruby: Give it back now!

87
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,340
It's a blackout

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,280
Wondol: Hey- Ruby: I-

89
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,920
You first

90
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,920
No, you first

91
00:06:14,80 --> 00:06:14,659
I'm sorry

92
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
for giving you the opal

93
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,740
But Opal isn't really bad luck

94
00:06:21,20 --> 00:06:22,580
This is probably all a coincidence

95
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,740
This all started with the Opal

96
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
But Opal has a different real meaning

97
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,320
Opal isn't really bad luck. It represents love, hope, innocence, luck and happiness.

98
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
So, I gave it to you as a gift

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,60
Did you research that?

100
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,420
I'm impressed

101
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,220
huh?

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,880
*not sure what she said here*

103
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
How long did you know that?

104
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,520
I'm sorry for before

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I wasn't even mad at you

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
I'm just upset over what happened

107
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
oh?

108
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,740
How could I leave it out like that?

109
00:07:15,40 --> 00:07:17,580
Opal needs to be kept in water to protect it from cracks

110
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,820
I really appreciate this gift. Look how beautiful it looks in the water

111
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,840
Look at this!

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,700
what?

113
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,860
I thought of a new concept!

114
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,540
All gemstones have a different meaning

115
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,220
I'll make jewelry that can grant anyone's wish

116
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,960
This isn't something that's normally easy to do (?)

117
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,540
But I talked to the higher ups, and they agreed to it (?)

118
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,360
so we're able to do it (?)

119
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,900
Okay

120
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,420
Thank you

121
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,160
I can't do it

122
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,900
How could I do this in two days?

123
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,819
I really can't do it

124
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,900
But Sir!

125
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,620
When you think of Jewelry, you think of Korea

126
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,800
Korea is a country that's developing at a rapid pace

127
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,80
What is there that can't be done in this world?

128
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,960
Come on, how can you do this to her?

129
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,860
Our center has done business with you for a long time-

130
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,360
Sir- Please~

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
please- seriously

132
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,400
Sir~

133
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,620
Please~ help us~

134
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,420
Please~

135
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,460
Help us~

136
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,660
Please help us~

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,440
please~ you have to~

138
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,860
I knew you could do it

139
00:10:34,20 --> 00:10:36,20
Now, when you release this-

140
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Hey- I'll give you a piggy back ride!

141
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Huh? I'm really heavy

142
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I'll be fine

143
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,480
Don't worry!

144
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
oh, you ARE heavy

145
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
You were right

146
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
you should lose some weight~

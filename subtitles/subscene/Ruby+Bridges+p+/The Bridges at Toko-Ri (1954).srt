1
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:33,549
<i>Jet launch has been cancelled.</i>
<i>Clear both catapults.</i>

2
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:38,452
<i>Two flights returning.</i>
<i>Expect to recover aircraft in ten minutes.</i>

3
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:50,925
<i>Stand by with fire bottle</i>
<i>for helicopter turn-up.</i>

4
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:56,136
Shake a leg, Forney.
There're two flights coming in.

5
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,970
We're here, ain't we?
Keep your jumper on, sir.

6
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,239
And Mike, don't put that hat on
until you clear the deck.

7
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:06,407
- Captain Parker doesn't like it.
- Very well, sir.

8
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,488
<i>Prepare to launch helicopter.</i>

9
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,056
<i>Top off all jets and check Fly One</i>
<i>for ordinance load.</i>

10
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,773
<i>Launch helicopter.</i>

11
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,985
My hat and scarf, please.

12
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,813
Can't you wait until we get off the ship?

13
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,969
- What if the captain had seen you?
- We don't save captains, Nestor.
We save pilots.

14
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:08,910
When they're in the icy water with only
minutes to live, it makes them feel awful
good to look up and see this green hat.

15
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:13,074
I know that, but I'm telling you, Mike,
you're gonna get yourself in trouble.

16
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:18,246
And another thing. You gotta quit
sassing them officers like you just did.

17
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:24,624
When are you gonna learn, Nestor?
You can say anything you like to them
as long as you put "sir" on the end of it.

18
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:32,627
<i>Take 215 and 207</i>
<i>down the deck-edge elevator.</i>

19
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,569
<i>Prepare to re-spot aircraft for recovery.</i>

20
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,644
<i>We've got two flights of jets to land</i>
<i>and they're low on fuel. Look alive.</i>

21
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,154
<i>Stand by to land jets.</i>

22
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,361
<i>Clear the catwalks portside aft.</i>

23
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,706
<i>Check number six wire.</i>
<i>The centre fiddle bridge is down.</i>

24
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,379
Let's hear the checks, boy.

25
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,548
- Wheels down.
- Wheels down.

26
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,717
- Flaps down.
- Flaps down.

27
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,046
- Hook down.
- Hook down.
- All down, sir.
- All down.

28
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,621
- Clear deck.
- Clear deck.

29
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:36,091
Come on, Commander. Keep your nose up
so your hook will catch. That's it.

30
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,644
Good boy.

31
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,577
202, number three wire.
He did real good.

32
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,332
<i>Clear the catwalk aft.</i>

33
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,438
<i>211 to Bluejay. 211 to Bluejay.</i>
<i>Flame-out. Flame-out.</i>

34
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:34,114
CIC is reporting an emergency, sir.

35
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,024
Go ahead, CIC.

36
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:43,191
<i>211 reports a flame-out. Will have to ditch.</i>
<i>We'll dispatch a helicopter.</i>

37
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,873
- What's his position?
- <i>18 miles out.</i>

38
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,704
- Is there another jet with him?
- Affirmative. 210 is wingman.

39
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,881
- <i>Can he ditch near the destroyers?</i>
- Negative.

40
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,709
<i>- Very well. Keep me advised.</i>
- Aye, aye, sir.

41
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,408
- Have you got a fix on their position?
- Affirmative.

42
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,817
- How much fuel has the wingman got?
- 1,200 pounds.

43
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:09,325
Angel from Bluejay.
Your vector, 3-4-5 magnetic.

44
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:14,933
211 will have to ditch 18 miles out.
I say again. Your vector at 3-4-5 magnetic.

45
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,001
- Bluejay out.
- Bluejay from Angel. Roger.

46
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,506
210 from Bluejay.
Helicopter on way.

47
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,676
- <i>What is the condition of 211? Over.</i>
- 210 to Bluejay.

48
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,688
<i>211 is losing altitude rapidly</i>
<i>and is all set to ditch.</i>

49
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,165
210 to Bluejay.
There he goes.

50
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,646
211 just ditched.
Aircraft sank immediately.

51
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:15,422
Pilot got out.
Dye marker is visible.

52
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:25,094
Downed pilot afloat.
Have him in sight.

53
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:29,138
- <i>I'm staying here.</i>
- CIC to Flag Plot.

54
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,304
<i>210 requests permission</i>
<i>to stay with downed pilot.</i>

55
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,143
Permission granted.
Who is the pilot in the water?

56
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,320
- <i>Brubaker, sir.</i>
- Brubaker?

57
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:53,488
Just an hour ago a dispatch came in.
His wife and two kids are waiting for him
in Tokyo. He doesn't even know it yet.

58
00:08:56,469 --> 00:09:00,428
- Keep me advised on Brubaker.
- <i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

59
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,618
- Brubaker, huh?
- You know him?

60
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,582
I don't think I've ever seen him.
But I bet I can describe him.

61
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,749
He's about 30, well built,
a good-looking boy with a bit of a temper.

62
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,929
That's Brubaker all right.

63
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,090
Did you ever notice the pilots
the admiral takes special interest
in always look like that?

64
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,429
Now that you mention it, yeah.

65
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:34,504
That's what the admiral's son, George,
would have looked like.

66
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:40,077
<i>CIC to Flag Bridge.</i>
<i>210 has sighted helicopter approaching.</i>

67
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,817
- Tell 210 to return as quickly as possible.
We can't hold this course much longer.
- <i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

68
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:01,831
Angel from 210. Come on, Forney,
I can't hold him in sight much longer.

69
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,894
210 from Angel. I see him.
Go on home. Dinner's waiting.

70
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,538
Roger.

71
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,665
If you have to jump in, I'll wait around until
the Hornet sends one of its helicopters.

72
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,340
He looks froze.
I'll have to go down.

73
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:56,778
Sorry you have to ride in the rumble, sir.

74
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:02,511
But I haven't got anybody here
to haul you inside. Savo Angel to Bluejay.

75
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,681
<i>Two Angels coming home</i>
<i>with two frozen mackerel.</i>

76
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,231
- Admiral.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

77
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,662
Helicopter reports Brubaker aboard, sir.

78
00:12:16,468 --> 00:12:19,326
<i>The Hornet's helicopter</i>
<i>picked up Forney's crewman.</i>

79
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,336
- Good.
- The helicopter will land in three minutes.

80
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,908
- Turn right 90 degrees.
- Aye, aye, sir.

81
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,309
Round Table, this is Jehovah.

82
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:36,477
Turn right, 0-3-5.

83
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:40,648
Stand by. Execute.

84
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:52,498
I wish you could see this, Lieutenant.
Awful pretty sight.

85
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,299
You know, sir, it looks like
they're coming to meet us.

86
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:21,622
<i>Land the two helicopters aft</i>
<i>and stand by with a stretcher.</i>

87
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,591
<i>Keep clear of those rotors.</i>

88
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:02,331
<i>Clear a passage for that stretcher.</i>

89
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,617
- How are you feeling, boy?
- Oh, he's all right.

90
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,083
- That water's pretty cold, isn't it?
- It's not bad enough when
you're used to it like he is.

91
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,485
- Oh, Doctor, he's much
too young for brandy.
- You weren't in the water.

92
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:24,652
I know, but I had the hatch open.
It's awful cold in there.

93
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,371
Hello, Harry.
You don't look so bad.

94
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,540
- Hi, CAG.
- How's it going?

95
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:38,209
I didn't know water could get
so cold without being ice.

96
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,379
- Feel like talking to the admiral?
- Now?
- No, no.

97
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,340
- He says whenever you feel up to it.
He just wants to chat with you.
The doctor thinks you'll be fine tonight.
- Okay.

98
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:51,712
- I'll send for a uniform.
- Oh, you don't have to dress.
The admiral says just come up in your robe.

99
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,893
- See you later, Harry.
- Right.

100
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,737
- I believe the admiral wants to see me.
I'm Lieutenant Brubaker.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,569
He's in his cabin.
I'll tell him you're here.

102
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,280
<i>From the world-famous Chez Paris</i>
<i>in Chicago, overlooking beautiful</i>
<i>Lake Michigan,</i>

103
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:24,946
<i>the Armed Forces Radio Service</i>
<i> is brings you the music of</i>
<i>Henry Busse and his orchestra.</i>

104
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,633
This way, Lieutenant.

105
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,300
Come in.

106
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:50,641
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, come in, son.

107
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,147
- Coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

108
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,979
Sit down.

109
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,093
- How do you feel?
- I guess I'm thawed out by now.

110
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:07,755
I got the report on your ditching.
How long did it stay afloat?

111
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,869
- After the first bounce, sir,
I was a submarine.
- Didn't have time to get
your life raft out, huh?

112
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,599
It hooked on the seat.
I was lucky just to get myself out.

113
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:21,371
Well, those helicopter boys
are pretty good fishermen.

114
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,242
As far as I'm concerned,
they deserve every medal in the book.

115
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,344
You're out there all by yourself,
you know you can't last very long.

116
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,888
You're scared and you're freezing.
You curse and you pray.

117
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,084
Then suddenly you see that Mixmaster
whirling at you out of nowhere.

118
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:40,129
You look up and there's Forney
and his green hat.

119
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,960
Then you relax,
because you know you got it knocked.

120
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:48,800
Well, I'm mighty glad they pulled you out,
son. We can use you around here.

121
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,967
- Coming from you, Admiral,
I appreciate that.
- Oh, I mean it.

122
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,239
You fly well.
You go in low and you do your job.

123
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:06,090
You'd have a great future in the Navy.
Why don't you make it your career?

124
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:11,251
- You know what I think of the Navy, sir.
- Still bitter, hmm?

125
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,696
Go ahead, say what you think.
I always do.

126
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,967
Of course,
I've said it a couple of times too often.

127
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:28,670
Well, sir, the organized reserves were
drawing pay, but they weren't called up.

128
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,975
I was completely inactive and yet I was.

129
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:36,780
I had to give up my home,
my law practice, everything.

130
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,082
Yes, I'm still bitter.

131
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,694
Sometimes I'm so bitter I could put on
a phony act to the flight surgeon,
get a green slip and myself grounded.

132
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,626
Why don't you?

133
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:52,498
That's what I kept asking myself
this afternoon when I was
bobbing around in that ice water.

134
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:58,802
You do a lot of thinking at a time like that,
mostly about your friends who are
back home leading perfectly normal lives.

135
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,913
I wonder if you were back home
whether you wouldn't do the same.

136
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,414
It's not a question of indifference.
It's a question of distance.

137
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,984
They act that way they do
because they're there.

138
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:15,093
You don't quit, and go on doing
your job because you're here.
It's just as simple as that.

139
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,058
Son, whatever progress this world
has made, it's always been

140
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,495
because of the efforts
and the sacrifices of a few.

141
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:28,298
I was one of the few, Admiral,
at New Guinea, Leyte, Okinawa.
Why does it have to be me again?

142
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:34,002
Nobody ever knows why he gets
the dirty job, and this is a dirty job.

143
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,979
- Militarily, this war is a tragedy.
- I think we ought to pull out.

144
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:43,280
That's rubbish, son, you know it.
If we did, they'd take Japan,
Indo-China, the Philippines.

145
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,356
Where would you have us make our stand,
at the Mississippi?

146
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,622
All through history, men have had to
fight the wrong war in the wrong place,
but that's the one they're stuck with.

147
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:58,792
That's why, one of these days,
we'll knock out those bridges at Toko-Ri.

148
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,377
- Do we have to knock out
those particular bridges?
- Yes, we must.

149
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,571
I believe without question, some morning,
Communist generals and commissars

150
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:13,182
will be holding a meeting to
discuss the future of the war.

151
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:17,549
A messenger will run in and tell them,
"They've knocked out even
the bridges at Toko-Ri."

152
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:22,591
That little mission will convince
them that we'll never stop,
never weaken in our purpose.

153
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,763
And that's the day they'll quit.

154
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,762
But I didn't call you here
to discuss strategy, Brubaker.

155
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,834
I'm supposed to chew you out
because of your wife.

156
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,470
My wife?

157
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,800
- You knew she was in Japan.
- She made it.

158
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,968
- I hope she's got the kids with her.
- You better hope
you don't get a court martial.

159
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,411
- I had nothing to do with it, sir.
- How did she and the children
get here without your help?

160
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:47,517
Her father used to be a senator
from Massachusetts.

161
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:53,817
- Admiral, I don't care
if she's broken a dozen rules to make it.
- War's no place for women.

162
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,486
- I'll tell COMNAVFE you had nothing
to do with bringing her out here.
- Thank you, sir.

163
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,666
- When we get ashore,
I'd like to meet your wife.
- It'll be a pleasure.

164
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:06,133
- Why don't you see if the surgeon
can spare you a nightcap?
- I'll do that, sir.
- Give you a good night's sleep.

165
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:10,604
In three days, you'll be in Japan.
No more worries about take-offs for a while.

166
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,336
No, sir.
But it's gonna be a long three days.

167
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,862
<i>Group One, idle.</i>

168
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,695
<i>Group Two, idle.</i>

169
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,932
<i>Group One, full throttle.</i>

170
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,008
<i>Group Three, full.</i>

171
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,548
Come in.

172
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,622
- CAG wants to see you, Admiral.
- Hmm?
- Lee, Commander of the Air Group, is here.

173
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:10,531
Oh, send him in. Wait a minute.
What do you think of Lee?

174
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,194
He's a good man, popular.
The pilots all swear by him.

175
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,866
I got a letter from a friend in
the personnel office. They're looking for
someone for higher command training.

176
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:23,343
They want my confidential opinion of Lee.
Send him in.

177
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,653
<i>Group One, full throttle.</i>

178
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,420
Admiral, I received a dispatch
this morning from COMFAIRJAP.

179
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:39,886
It said the replacement aircraft
for the next tour are not available.

180
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,757
- Yes, I saw it.
- Well, all we'll have is
what's aboard this minute.

181
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,437
The captain's burning up the engines.

182
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,267
- Have you talked to the captain about it?
- I tried to, but he wouldn't see me.

183
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,739
I don't wonder.
He's a little busy berthing the ship.

184
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:57,904
Well, if he keeps doing it this way, sir,
we won't have any propeller planes left.

185
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:02,887
How would you berth a carrier
against the wind, Commander?

186
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:06,546
I'd anchor in the stream before
I'd run a lash-down engine at top speed.

187
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,955
That's not fair to the pilots
who have to fly them, sir.

188
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:17,198
You know as well as I do that the pinwheel
operation is necessary in this harbor.

189
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:21,702
There's no room to get a tug between
the dock and the ship. Those planes are
the only thing that can hold us off.

190
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:25,707
For the last hundred yards, yes.
But he's been running those engines
from the moment we hit the channel.

191
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:28,709
Do you consider a few engines
more valuable than a carrier?

192
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,483
No, sir, but they've only got so many
good hours. Burn them up on deck...

193
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:36,043
- How long have you been in the Navy, Lee?
- 20 years, sir.

194
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:40,714
20 years. You're the commander
of the Air Group.

195
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,885
What would you think of one of your pilots
if he went over your head and came to me?

196
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:48,555
You know the task-force
commander doesn't interfere
with the running of any ship.

197
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:51,895
Yes, sir. But under extraordinary
circumstances such as these I feel...

198
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,902
You're coming up for promotion, Lee.

199
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,066
Don't you realize Captain Parker will
have to turn in a fitness report on you?

200
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:02,838
- Yes, sir.
- Suppose I did talk to the captain?

201
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:07,747
What kind of a fitness report
do you think he'd give you then?

202
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,930
I guess I was only looking at it
from my point of view, sir.

203
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,329
I was just thinking of
what was best for my pilots.

204
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:30,834
- Next time, think twice.
- Yes, sir, I will.

205
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:42,977
There are two things I don't like to see
a young officer do. The first is going
over somebody's head.

206
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:47,989
But once he does, I hate to see
him back down so quickly from
something he believes is right.

207
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:54,655
He'll be all right for some job,
but as far as higher command goes.

208
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:57,027
And I'll have to tell them so.

209
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,365
<i>The uniform of the day for liberty</i>
<i>is dress blue.</i>

210
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:33,026
<i>Liberty will expire on board at 0700.</i>

211
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:39,704
- Looking for your wife, sir?
- Yeah. There she is.

212
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,989
Mrs. Brubaker.

213
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,599
You know, sir, I've got the same kind of
reception waiting for me outside the gates.

214
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,607
- You married?
- Not yet, but I may be after this leave.

215
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:17,248
<i>Liberty party fall in. Muster</i>
<i>on the flight deck for inspection.</i>

216
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,979
Lower away. Easy.

217
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,448
All right, men.
Open up, front and centre.

218
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,120
- Hey, Beer Barrel, what's your handicap?
- I only have two hands, junior.
That's my handicap.

219
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:38,162
- I can't lift those beer mugs fast enough.
- Hey, Beer Barrel, do you need a caddy?

220
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,362
You bet. After the first nine steins,
they get pretty heavy.

221
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:44,269
Permission to leave the ship, sir.

222
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,385
Oh, darling. Darling.

223
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,320
- Where are the kids?
- It was too long of a trip for them.

224
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:11,002
- How long is your leave?
- A week. Are the kids okay?

225
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:15,703
Oh, they're fine. I found a wonderful
Japanese nurse. Come on, darling.
They're dying to see you.

226
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,787
Have your liberty cards ready.
All right. Have your liberty cards ready.

227
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,640
Have your liberty cards ready.

228
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:02,249
There she is, Nestor.
Hey, Kimiko. Your man's back!

229
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,650
Not so fast, Big Boy.
Things are different. We got to talk.

230
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,422
All right, let's find some cosy
little nook where we can talk.

231
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:54,535
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Daddy, Daddy!

232
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:57,041
Kathy! Susie!

233
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:05,315
- We saw you getting out of the car.
- You did, huh? They've gotten so big.

234
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,816
- This is Setsuko, Daddy.
- How are you?

235
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,288
- Have they been good?
- Oh, yes.

236
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,158
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming. I'm coming.

237
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,040
Thank you.

238
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,044
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
- Yes, Kathy?
- Come here, I want to
show you the fish pond.

239
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:42,208
Kathy, take your sweater off and put it away
in the closet and see that Susie does, too.

240
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:55,031
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
- Yes, honey?
- Come on, I want to show you
the funny bed I sleep in.

241
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:59,303
Okay, young lady, you show me.

242
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,974
Why don't you leave me alone?

243
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:12,138
When I'm standing out there
with those paddles in my hands,
I have enough to worry about you, guys.

244
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:16,650
When I get ashore,
I don't want to worry about anything.

245
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:22,316
One thing does worry me, though.
Have they got enough beer in Japan?

246
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:27,064
- Good evening, boys.
- Good evening, Admiral.

247
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,096
- Brubaker, how's the family?
- Oh, fine, thank you, sir.

248
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:36,073
- Admiral, this is Mrs. Brubaker, Nancy.
- How do you do?

249
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,033
I thought your husband was
going to take off like a jet when
he heard you were here, Mrs. Brubaker,

250
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,545
- and now I understand why.
- Thank you, Admiral.

251
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:47,616
- I was kind of pleased to see him, too.
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- Thanks.

252
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,778
- Well, they didn't keep you
in Tokyo too long.
- No, they don't any more.

253
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,584
Not since that first press conference.

254
00:29:55,994 --> 00:30:01,626
I told them we were fighting
Russian guns, Russian radar,
Russian planes and Russian submarines.

255
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:06,463
A lot of our men are being killed by Russian
equipment manned by Russian experts.

256
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,301
Ever since then, they bundle me
out here as fast as possible.

257
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,310
- I'm Lieutenant Brubaker.
- A gentleman to see you, sir.
- Oh.

258
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:17,781
Excuse me.

259
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,651
- Will you have a drink?
- Doctor won't let me.

260
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:30,149
- What is it, Nestor?
- Mike's been in a terrible fight, Lieutenant.

261
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,329
- Just Mike?
- No, sir.

262
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,158
But I got away. Mike's in jail, sir, in Tokyo.

263
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,392
- I came out as quick as I could.
- What happened?

264
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,764
His girl's marrying a boatswain
from the Essex.

265
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,631
Oh, it was bad, sir. If you don't come,
he'll be locked up permanent.

266
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:51,243
- Nestor, Tokyo is 60 miles away.
I'll phone the MPs right...
- Calling won't help, sir.

267
00:30:52,249 --> 00:30:56,546
Mike clobbered two MPs,
along with the gang from the Essex.

268
00:30:56,954 --> 00:31:03,592
- What did you two do,
take on the whole town?
- Yes, sir. Practically.

269
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:10,623
- Nestor, I'd like to do something, but...
- Oh, please, Lieutenant.
You gotta help Mike.

270
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:17,300
Okay, I'll come.
You wait here.

271
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,643
- Excuse me, Admiral.
Honey, there's been some trouble in Tokyo
and I think I better go.
- Oh, Harry.

272
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,307
- What kind of trouble?
- It's Mike Forney again, sir.
- Uh-oh.

273
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:32,419
A girl, another sailor, a brawl,
the usual consequences. He's in jail.

274
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:35,720
Oh, Harry, you don't have to get
mixed up with brawling sailors.

275
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:39,886
Darling, if Forney were in China
I'd have to help him.

276
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,032
Harry.

277
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:00,342
If you were freezing to death in the sea
and a man brought his helicopter
right over your head and rescued you,

278
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,752
wouldn't you help that man
if he got in trouble?

279
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:08,114
- Did Harry crash at sea?
- Yes, four days ago.

280
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,425
You know your husband's at war,

281
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:20,031
but somehow you just can't believe
that he'd crash into the sea.

282
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:25,642
- Hasn't Harry told you anything
about what he's been doing?
- He never talks about the war.

283
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:29,802
With the rest of them, he's been
doing a tough job and doing it well.

284
00:32:30,014 --> 00:32:33,609
But when we go back to sea,
he's got a tough one ahead of him.

285
00:32:33,818 --> 00:32:39,654
He's going to have to fly against
some certain bridges.

286
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:43,989
- Ask him to tell you about them.
- I don't even want to think about it.

287
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,826
I suppose to you that's
a sign of weakness, isn't it?

288
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,002
Maybe not weakness.

289
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:56,898
But like most people at home, you've been
protected. You're ignorant and defenseless.

290
00:32:57,108 --> 00:33:02,944
- Harry doesn't want me to worry.
- That's the way my son, George, felt.

291
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,715
Harry often reminds me of him...

292
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:09,275
Same quick temper and the same
thorough way of doing things.

293
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,515
As a matter of fact, in certain ways
you remind me a little of George's wife.

294
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,455
She didn't want to think
about it either, is that it?

295
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,296
When George was killed at Midway,
she never recovered.

296
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,463
For a while, she tried to make love
with every man in uniform.

297
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,644
Thought he might die one day.

298
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:38,643
Then she grew to loathe herself
and attempted suicide.

299
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,978
I don't know where she is now
or what she's doing.

300
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:45,644
Once she was my... my son's wife.

301
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:53,657
And you think, if things go wrong
at those bridges, I might be like that?

302
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:59,462
Perhaps, if you don't let yourself
think about certain things.

303
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,767
If you refuse to acknowledge
what you're up against,
terrible consequences can follow.

304
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:08,104
I shouldn't have come out here.
That's what you're trying to tell me, isn't it?

305
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:14,547
No. In spite of all the regulations,
maybe you were right to come.

306
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:18,347
Perhaps when George was killed,
if my wife had come out to join me,

307
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,047
things might have been different.

308
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:25,286
But she stayed at home,
like a good Navy wife.

309
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,960
Then when our other boy was killed
trying to torpedo a Japanese carrier,
it was just too much for her.

310
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:37,498
- You lost two sons and your wife?
- No.

311
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,176
Margaret is still alive.

312
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:47,641
But all that was gentle and loving
about her slowly withered away.

313
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:55,990
Now she sits quietly alone in her room,
knitting a baby's sweater.

314
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:04,195
- Oh, Admiral, I'm so ashamed.
- Don't be.

315
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:09,704
Just be grateful for what you have.
And above all, be honest with yourself.

316
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:14,536
If I can't face the reality now,

317
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:21,783
then there won't be much hope for me
afterward if anything should happen.

318
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,614
I have a feeling you'll be all right.

319
00:35:25,823 --> 00:35:29,281
Let's get your little girls have dinner.

320
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,656
Come on, Nestor.

321
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:10,093
Major, I'm Lieutenant Brubaker. You've
got a chief here by the name of Forney.
He's off our ship, the Savo Island.

322
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,660
- I'd like to get him out.
- I wish I could help you, Lieutenant.

323
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:17,873
But your wild Irishman
just wrecked a dance hall.

324
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:23,276
- Well, he also saved the lives of four pilots.
- Look, Lieutenant,

325
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:28,783
I got a lot of monsters
back there in that birdcage.
Every one of them was a hero in Korea.

326
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,285
But here in Tokyo, they're all monsters.

327
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,722
Well, Forney's a helicopter pilot.
The other day I had to ditch my plane at sea.

328
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:40,225
These two men saved my life.
As a matter of fact,
this man here jumped into the ocean...

329
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:45,291
And I suppose his face got chopped up
that way by the waves.

330
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,604
- Well, I know there was a brawl...
- A brawl?

331
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,237
Lieutenant, a brawl is when may be
six guys get to throwing punches.

332
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:58,474
But these two monsters
took on half of Tokyo.

333
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:05,422
- Are you married, Major?
- Yes.

334
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:10,583
Well, we just got in at noon today. I haven't
seen my wife or kids for over a year.

335
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:14,554
I left them at Fuji-san and came all
the way up here to get Mike out of jail.

336
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:17,935
That's what I think of these two men.

337
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:24,968
Well, you willing to cough up 80 bucks
for the damage he did?

338
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,137
- I'd pay 800 if I had to.
- Okay, Sergeant, drag Forney out here.

339
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:36,048
Sign here. He's yours,
but you're not getting any bargain.

340
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:40,791
I knew you could do it, Lieutenant.

341
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:50,695
- Thanks, Major. Come on.
- Oh, Lieutenant.
Don't let him get away from you.

342
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,894
There are parts of Tokyo
comparatively unharmed yet.

343
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:11,547
- Look, Lieutenant...
- You two are going back to Yokosuka.

344
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:16,256
- You gotta come with me.
You gotta talk to Kimiko.
She can't marry that ape from the Essex.
- Look, Mike, I'm not...

345
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,590
Sure, you are.
She'll listen to you, Lieutenant.
Please just do me this one favour.

346
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,927
- All right, where is she?
- Follow me, sir.

347
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:06,569
- Pardon me, sir, but you're
not supposed to be in here.
- It's all right, sonny, he's with me.

348
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:41,769
Lieutenant, there she is!

349
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:50,111
- Kimiko, this is Lieutenant Brubaker.
- Oh.

350
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,654
I wondered whether any girl
warranted a riot. I guess you do.

351
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:57,521
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- He wants to talk to you.

352
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,660
I'm very sorry, Lieutenant.

353
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:04,166
But while Mike at sea,
I lose my heart to Essex man.

354
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:07,064
Essex not at sea.

355
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:09,739
But Mike's a fine man.
You couldn't do better than Mike.

356
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,640
I know. Mike good man.
But I lose my heart, Lieutenant.

357
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:18,974
Not in my dress, you don't!

358
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:23,479
Lieutenant, she took me through
too much pain! Leave me alone!

359
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,825
- Hey, Mike.
- What is it? You...

360
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:32,684
- What's going on over there?
- All right, break it up.

361
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:38,025
- Get out of the way, fellas.
- Break it up.

362
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,972
Break it up. Break it up.
What's going on here?

363
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,853
I'll guess you'll live.

364
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,221
- Kimiko.
- Here, Lieutenant. Don't worry, sir.
I'll get him back for everything.

365
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:06,354
- Kimiko.
- Come on, you're going back to the ship.
- That's my girl.

366
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,191
Kimiko.

367
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:33,817
- I'm sorry, darling.
- It's all right.

368
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:40,828
- Did you get him out of jail?
- Yes, I got him out.

369
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:46,997
Admiral Tarrant told me about Mike Forney.

370
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,675
I wish he hadn't.

371
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:05,811
Don't worry. I've had it now.
No one ever crashes twice.

372
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:11,525
Harry, what are the bridges
you have to bomb when you go back?

373
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,698
Tell me about the bridges, darling.

374
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:21,627
You know, I think Kathy and Susie
ought to have piano lessons
when they get a bit older.

375
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:28,634
It's funny. I was thinking
the same thing just the other day.

376
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:36,718
I always wanted to learn.
Never got around to it.

377
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:41,256
Same here.
They say if you start young enough...

378
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:45,117
- They got new methods now.
It doesn't take as long.
- I know.

379
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:50,364
Mildred Porter learned in just a few months.
Even after four or five weeks...

380
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:54,527
Harry, you've got to tell me
about those bridges!

381
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:15,850
The bridges span a narrow gap
between two mountains.

382
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,396
It's one of the most important
targets in all of Korea.

383
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,429
Consequently, it's fortified accordingly.

384
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:28,264
Although we're only over the target
about 30 seconds...

385
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,269
...it's a lifetime.

386
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:37,306
Every kind of gun imaginable is
hidden in those mountainsides.

387
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:44,213
The men behind those guns know where
we're coming from and where we're headed.

388
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,250
They know we're not going to
fly above the mountains.

389
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,431
We're gonna fly between them.

390
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,833
We're coming in low and straight.

391
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:02,205
There's no room to twist or duck.

392
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:06,941
And there's no surprising them.

393
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,312
They're just sitting there...

394
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,813
waiting for us...

395
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,546
...hoping we'll come.

396
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,453
That's Toko-Ri, Nancy.

397
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:33,293
- I'm glad you told me.
- Does it help?

398
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,472
I think so.

399
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:42,202
You didn't want to tell me
because you didn't want me to worry.

400
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:46,372
Well, I don't want you to worry either.
About me, I mean.

401
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,722
I know what the admiral
was trying to tell me.

402
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:57,321
I had to face those bridges, too.

403
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:04,558
Well, I have.
And I'll be all right now.

404
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:18,939
- I'm gonna swim all the way
across the pool.
- So am I.

405
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:24,120
- Harry, I'm not so sure about this.
- Oh, don't be silly, Nancy.

406
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,554
Now, you ladies go in there
and I'll go in here.

407
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:36,258
Harry, you get in the pool first. We're not
coming out until I know the coast is clear.

408
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,300
Okay, you modest violets.

409
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:48,440
- Daddy, why does the water taste so funny?
- Because it's mineral water, Kathy.
It comes right out of the spring.

410
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:52,145
- Watch me swim, Daddy.
- Okay.

411
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:57,047
That's fine, Kathy, fine.

412
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,286
- Harry, are you sure that door is locked?
- Absolutely.

413
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:05,355
- Watch me swim, too, Daddy.
- Okay, Susie.

414
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:17,899
Hey, hey, this is private. This is private.
We had it reserved.

415
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,009
No, private, reserved.

416
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:32,016
Number one. Good morning.

417
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:36,318
No, no, you don't understand.
We had it reserved.
The whole pool is reserved.

418
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:42,354
- No, no!
- Harry, do something!

419
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:46,832
- What can I do?
- Take a deep breath.

420
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,522
- <i>Ohayo.</i>
- <i>Ohayo.</i>

421
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:10,459
- <i>Ohayo.</i>
- <i>Ohayo.</i>

422
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,590
That means "good morning" in Japanese.

423
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:17,631
- Belong you?
- Yes.

424
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,167
Belong me.

425
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,999
- Keiko. Takako.
- I'm Kathy.

426
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:28,378
I'm Susie.

427
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:32,247
Happy family.

428
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,620
Yes, happy family!

429
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:04,108
This is Tilly. She picks up aircraft
and gets them off the deck
if they lose a wheel or something.

430
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:09,274
- Why do they call her Tilly?
- Why do they call you Nancy?

431
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,979
<i>The ship will get under way</i>
<i>in 45 minutes.</i>

432
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:19,351
<i>Visitors are requested</i>
<i>to be off the ship in 15 minutes.</i>

433
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:26,102
<i>Now hear this. The officer of the deck</i>
<i>is shifting his watch to the bridge.</i>

434
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,814
Here comes Beer Barrel.

435
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,412
- Hey, Beer Barrel, give me...
- What was your score, Beer Barrel?
- Don't drop your putter.

436
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,845
Hey, what's par for the cruise, Beer Barrel?

437
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:50,493
- Pull your flaps up, boys.
- You get it away off.
- You sure are overloaded.

438
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:54,493
- Report my return aboard, sir.
- Report my return aboard, sir.

439
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:57,964
- Get refuelled, Beer Barrel.
- Report my return aboard, sir.

440
00:49:08,379 --> 00:49:11,247
Can I help you with those, sir?

441
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:17,453
Thanks, sonny, but this is a man's work.

442
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:30,764
We've got a few minutes yet.
That's Mike Forney.

443
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,598
- Green scarf?
- Yeah.

444
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,841
I never knew there were
so many beautiful girls.

445
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:47,342
- There ain't. We cornered the market.
- Best thing ever happened to you, Mike,
losing Kimiko to that big ape
from the Essex.

446
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,954
Nestor, you're a wise man.
There she is, girls.

447
00:49:52,355 --> 00:49:56,114
The Savo, the greatest flat top in the fleet.

448
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,055
What's called this ship?

449
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,033
Oh, that.
That's the Essex.

450
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:16,034
Not here, Mike!
There's too much brass and SPs.

451
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,116
You're right.

452
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,486
She ain't worth it.
What's one girl?

453
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:41,004
The flower of Japan.

454
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,498
The pride of the fleet, my lad.
The best man won.

455
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:53,410
- Thank you.
- Bless you, my children.

456
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,614
Come on, Forney's at it again.

457
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,992
- Hey, look, Chico's in a fight.
- Swing at me and I'll flatten you.

458
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,992
- Kill that little shrimp.
- That's the guy that started it.

459
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:11,558
- Hey, give me your hand.
- Who do you think you're hitting, Mike?

460
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,828
Hey, get back. Get back.
This ain't no place for a lady.

461
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:18,867
- Come on, we need you.
- Charlie, come here.

462
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:26,444
- Hey, what's going on here?
- All right, all right, break it up.
- Come on, back to the ship.

463
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,746
- Come on, get on board or we'll run you in.
- All right, come on, come on, fellas.

464
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:34,517
- Let's go.
- Come on, boys, back to the ship.

465
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:39,125
That's the man you spent
half the night getting out of jail?

466
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,027
Yes, and I'd do it again.

467
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,619
Although we're going out to get
new pictures of the target area,

468
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:21,855
this flak intelligence photo
will give you some idea
how rough this mission is gonna be.

469
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:26,525
In order to determine the tactical
approach, I'll fly the mission to get
the pre-strike photos.

470
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:32,497
- Brubaker, you'll fly cover for me.
- Roger.
- We'll come in from the west. You stay
at least 3,000 feet above me at all times.

471
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:36,839
But keep away from even altitudes.
It makes it tougher on the gunners.

472
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,877
We'll take off in an hour.
All right, Martin, you've got it.

473
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:50,982
Boy, what a spot to take pictures.
When I go, I want bombs, not cameras.

474
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:54,163
<i>All cameras ready on photographic plane.</i>

475
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,824
<i>Clear port and starboard catwalks forward.</i>

476
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,837
<i>Prepare to launch photographic mission.</i>

477
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,802
<i>Launch jets.</i>

478
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:17,566
Bluejay, this is Peter Peter 21.
My feet are dry.

479
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:20,033
Crossing first checkpoint.

480
00:56:33,623 --> 00:56:37,520
There's our second checkpoint.
Town of Majon-ni.

481
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,584
Just passed Yang-dok.

482
00:57:12,963 --> 00:57:15,825
Target 15 miles ahead.

483
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:31,445
Remember, CAG, all you got is
a camera. Get in and get out.

484
00:57:32,649 --> 00:57:36,745
I'm only gonna take their pictures,
but watch how mad they get.

485
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:39,717
Commencing run.

486
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:36,634
I've seen it rough, CAG,
but that was the roughest.

487
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:46,619
- You all right?
- I think so. I felt something
that could've been a hit.

488
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:51,453
My tail-hook position light came on.
Drop down, look me, over.

489
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,182
- Nothing visible.
- Good. Mission completed.

490
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,084
Returning to carrier.

491
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,435
Real estate sure looks
better on the way home.

492
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,886
<i>Stand by to land jet aircraft.</i>

493
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,291
- Wheels down.
- Wheels down.

494
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,926
- Flaps down.
- Flaps down.

495
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,561
- Hook down.
- Hook down.

496
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:44,128
- All down, sir.
- All down.
- Clear deck.
- Clear deck.

497
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:48,943
<i>Clear deck. Land aircraft.</i>

498
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,618
Nice going, CAG.
Roger pass!

499
01:01:04,294 --> 01:01:06,462
Clear the deck!

500
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,739
<i>Stand by to rig a new barricade.</i>

501
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,995
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

502
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:54,534
Bluejay to 209er. Follow deck.
Peter Peter 21 crashed. He's okay.

503
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:58,878
- <i>What is your state?</i>
- Fuel critical.

504
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,950
- Only 650 pounds remaining.
- <i>Barrier being repaired.</i>

505
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:07,145
- <i>Estimate ten-minute delay.</i>
- I'll be out of fuel by then.

506
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:11,687
- <i>How about the Hornet?</i>
- <i>Hornet not spotted for recovery.

507
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,421
- Orbit ship.
- Roger.

508
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:23,961
<i>Get that barrier cleared</i>
<i>and that plane out of there.</i>

509
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:31,644
<i>Man Tilly!</i>
<i>Barricade is not repairable.</i>

510
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,908
<i>Tilly will be used</i>
<i>to protect planes forward.</i>

511
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:44,887
I've only got 450 pounds left. How about it?
I don't want to go into the sea again.

512
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:51,127
<i>Position Tilly</i>
<i>in the number-three barrier spot.</i>

513
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:09,008
- <i>On the double!</i>
- <i>Impossible to repair barrier in time.</i>

514
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:13,978
<i>Must use Tilly to protect planes forward.</i>
<i>Deck is pitching badly.</i>

515
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:18,019
<i>Do you wish to attempt deck landing</i>
<i>or do you wish to ditch?</i>

516
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,525
I'll come aboard.

517
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:32,298
Pri fly says if he doesn't make it
the first time, he'll have to ditch.
He hasn't got enough fuel for another pass.

518
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,477
I'll bring him in
if Tilly doesn't bother him.

519
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,475
<i>Stand by.</i>

520
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:46,012
<i>All personnel, clear the deck aft</i>
<i>and at base of the island.</i>
<i>Stand by with crash equipment.</i>

521
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:57,264
Bring me in, Beer Barrel!
No wave-off!

522
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:04,031
Come on, junior. I know the deck's dancing,
but you gotta make it this time.

523
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:27,058
<i>All planes aboard.</i>
<i>Continue clearing barrier.</i>

524
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:32,298
<i>Strike Peter Peter 21 below</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

525
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:58,658
<i>Commence refuelling. The smoking</i>
<i>lamp is out throughout the ship.</i>

526
01:05:02,432 --> 01:05:05,430
Maybe you'd better not fly for a few days.

527
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:09,127
I'm all right. Thanks.
This is all I needed.

528
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,572
- What are they doing? Moving you, Doc?
- They're not moving me.

529
01:05:19,782 --> 01:05:21,875
We're sending some medical
supplies to the destroyer.

530
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:26,278
She's coming alongside
to pick up Forney and Gamidge.

531
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:30,150
- Forney and Gamidge?
- Haven't you heard?
The captain's having them transferred.

532
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:35,220
They're going to the helicopter scow
at Yodo Island.

533
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,720
- So long, Gamidge. Good luck.
- Thanks. Same to you, sir.

534
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:09,890
Watch out, Nestor.
Don't get your feet wet.

535
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,103
You're liable to catch cold!

536
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:19,668
So long, Lieutenant.
We'll send you the 80 bucks.

537
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,241
Good luck, Nestor.

538
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:42,225
They want us to fly our eggbeater in behind
enemy lines three times a day after meals.

539
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,756
I don't mind rough duty, though.
I really hate them Commies!

540
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,695
Take care of yourself, Mike.
The pilots need men like you.

541
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,972
Thank you, sir.

542
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:55,633
Well, Lieutenant, if you ever have to
ditch around Wonsan Harbor,
we'll be there to fish you out again.

543
01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:00,139
What's the matter, Lieutenant?
You look kind to edgy. You know
what I used to do when I got jittery?

544
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:04,041
I used to walk to the forward end
of that flight deck,
let that spray hit me in the kisser.

545
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:08,212
- Used to fix me up every time.
- All right, Forney, let's go.
- Right.

546
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,563
Why don't you try it sometime, Lieutenant?

547
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:43,323
The two stone bridges offer the best targets.

548
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:46,422
But you'll also have to hit the low ones.

549
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:50,287
We'll give you coordinates and checkpoints
the final briefing tomorrow afternoon.

550
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:54,959
Now, your secondary target
will be this fuel dump at Tok-tong.

551
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:00,909
We've hit this before, of course,
but there's evidence of new activity in
the area. Are there any questions?

552
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:05,444
Yes, about Toko-Ri. Where would you say is
the heaviest concentration of flak?

553
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,179
Here are the shots from my wing camera.

554
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:12,013
Does that answer your question?

555
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,048
The flight will consist of three divisions.

556
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:24,085
We'll make our approach from the west,
and attack three times if necessary.

557
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,592
Martin, you'll take your four jets
in to suppress flak.

558
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,988
I'll follow with my division on
the western bridges.

559
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,800
Brubaker, your division will take
the two bridges to the east.

560
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,866
Roy, you'll be the last man down.

561
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,940
You'll give a damage report
after each attack.

562
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:45,978
Take-off will be at 1500, so when we go in,
we'll have the sun at our backs.

563
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:51,953
Any questions?

564
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:05,457
<i>We're back here in the Broadcasting Room</i>
<i>on a warm, sunny day here at the Memorial</i>
<i>Coliseum in Los Angeles.</i>

565
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:08,359
<i>The temperature in the high eighties</i>
<i>and you oughta see this sight!</i>

566
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,870
<i>80,000 fans are sure getting</i>
<i>the thrill of their lives this afternoon.</i>

567
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:15,043
<i>This is the big one.</i>
<i>The rams trail the 49ers by six points.</i>

568
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:20,238
<i>And the winner meets Cleveland for the title.</i>
<i>Now, the Rams line up again.</i>
<i>The ends are split wide.</i>

569
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,184
<i>Van Brocklin is dropping back to pass.</i>
<i>He gets good protection.</i>

570
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:29,491
<i>It's a long one to Fears.</i>
<i>He's dropped on the six-yard line.</i>
<i>First and goal to go.</i>

571
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,015
<i>Dear Nancy,</i>

572
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:07,345
<i>these will probably be the last words...</i>

573
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:12,689
<i>...you'll ever receive from me.</i>

574
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,188
<i>Dear Nancy,</i>

575
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:48,385
<i>I wish I could tell you</i>
<i>how wonderful it was to see you.</i>

576
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,872
<i>I'll never forget the picture of you...</i>

577
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:04,278
<i>...standing there on the dock as we came in.</i>

578
01:13:18,994 --> 01:13:22,953
- What are you doing, Harry?
- I was just writing a letter to Nancy.

579
01:13:23,165 --> 01:13:26,760
- I can't sleep with all this racket going on.
- Yeah, I've noticed that, too.

580
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:32,435
- It always seems louder just before
you're going out on a mission. You all right?
- Yeah.

581
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,600
Look, Harry,
this is an important mission, very important.

582
01:13:36,812 --> 01:13:40,971
We've gotta do a first-rate professional job.
I can't afford to take chances.

583
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,450
I know.

584
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:46,048
If a guy comes clean and grounds himself,
I'm grateful.

585
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:51,459
But if he tries to bluff it out and endangers
an entire mission, it's unforgivable.

586
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,828
Think it over, Harry.

587
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:30,848
<i>Pilots, man planes.</i>

588
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,895
<i>Pilots, man planes.</i>

589
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:52,639
<i>Stand by to start jet engines.</i>

590
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,683
<i>Launch jets.</i>

591
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:37,968
Flight from CAG.
Target dead ahead. Prepare to attack.

592
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:48,651
<i>205 to CAG.</i>
<i>Commencing flak-suppression run.</i>

593
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:20,237
- 212 from Zero-Zero.
- <i>This is 212. Damage report follows.</i>

594
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:24,407
<i>Three bridges down.</i>
<i>One railway bridge intact.</i>

595
01:20:24,619 --> 01:20:27,047
Are you sure, Roy?
It looked like direct hits on all of them.

596
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:31,414
- <i>Negative.</i>
- Stand by for second attack.

597
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:44,468
CAG to Flight.
Commencing second attack.

598
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:30,306
All bridges down.
All bridges down. Nice going, CAG.

599
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:34,477
<i>CAG to Flight.</i>
<i>Rendezvous and proceed to secondary target.</i>

600
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:08,345
CAG to Flight. Secondary target below.
Commencing first run.

601
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,576
210 from 209er.
I think I just took a hit.

602
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:20,628
210! 210 from 209er.
Just took a hit. Where are you?

603
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:24,788
<i>Harry, this is CAG.</i>
<i>210 must have radio failure.</i>

604
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,959
<i>I have you in sight.</i>
<i>I'll be with you in a minute.</i>

605
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,456
No visible damage.
A little vapour coming from your fuselage.

606
01:23:55,664 --> 01:24:01,962
- Could it be hydraulic fluid or fuel.
- RPM is surging a little bit.
Everything else seems okay.

607
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:17,682
CAG to 205. Martin, take over.
I'm staying with Brubaker.

608
01:24:17,886 --> 01:24:23,188
<i>CAG from 205. Roger.</i>
<i>Will stay above and keep you in sight.</i>

609
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:29,694
Thanks, CAG. I was worried there
for a minute. I thought I might have to
land here. I think I'll make it all right.

610
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,837
- <i>Brubaker from CAG. What state?</i>
- Fuel okay. 2,000 pounds.

611
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:46,509
Keep checking, Harry. You're losing fuel.
Hydraulic fluid would be gone by now.

612
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:51,276
- Can you still see vapour trail?
- <i>Affirmative. Don't your gauges show it?</i>

613
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:53,886
- Can't tell.
- <i>You'll make it to the sea all right.</i>

614
01:24:54,289 --> 01:25:00,221
Wonsan Harbor's just over the ridge.
If you can make the helicopter scow,
they'll pick you up.

615
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,056
Yeah, sure, I'll make it.

616
01:25:10,004 --> 01:25:13,433
I'm losing fuel fast now, CAG.
Down to 1,600 pounds.

617
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:16,470
<i>You'd better call the word now, Harry.</i>

618
01:25:28,923 --> 01:25:30,891
You'd better call the scow.

619
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:36,724
Yeah.
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

620
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:46,630
<i>This is 209er. RDF call.</i>
<i>35 miles north-west Wonsan.</i>

621
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:50,811
<i>Flak damage.
Losing fuel rapidly.</i>

622
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:52,404
Let's go, Nestor.

623
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:56,011
Alligator 1 to 209er.
Give me a call for a bearing.

624
01:25:56,451 --> 01:26:01,748
<i>Emergency! Emergency!</i>
<i>Prepare helicopter for launch.</i>

625
01:26:08,196 --> 01:26:12,690
<i>1-2-3-4-4-3.</i>

626
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:15,803
<i>Launch helicopter.</i>

627
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:45,288
<i>Bluejay, Bluejay.</i>
<i>This is Alligator 1.</i>

628
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:51,095
- Alligator 1, this is Bluejay. Go ahead.
- <i>209er has had an emergency.</i>

629
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:56,542
<i>He bears 3-3-0 degrees,</i>
<i>35 miles from Wonsan.</i>

630
01:26:56,745 --> 01:27:00,176
Air Op, CIC. We have an emergency.
Stand by to write.

631
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:11,655
- Can't last much longer, CAG.
- You're doing fine, Harry. You'll make it.

632
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,191
Fuel tanks empty.
I've had it.

633
01:27:33,481 --> 01:27:35,278
I still think you can make it, Harry.

634
01:27:36,517 --> 01:27:39,782
I've got enough altitude to glide to
the water if I can only clear the ridge.

635
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,475
Can't make it.

636
01:28:11,152 --> 01:28:13,586
- <i>What are you gonna do, Harry?</i>
- Crash.

637
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,949
They love to fire at parachutes.

638
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:18,255
Alligator 1, this is Zero-Zero.

639
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:23,120
209er crash-landing,
bearing 3-3-5 degrees.

640
01:28:23,331 --> 01:28:27,290
- 25 miles from Yodo Island.
- <i>Roger your transmission.</i>

641
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:32,804
<i>Trying to divert propellered aircraft to crash</i>
<i>for rescap protection of downed pilot.</i>

642
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:41,608
- There's a clearing ahead looks pretty good.
- I see it.

643
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:45,445
- Looks like an irrigation ditch
along the side.
- <i>That's right.</i>

644
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:49,350
<i>Try to land near it.</i>
<i>Get out fast. Make for that ditch.</i>

645
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:55,318
- Be sure and hit every item
on your checkoff list, Harry.
- <i>I'm doing that now.</i>

646
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:59,968
<i>Tighten your shoulder straps</i>
<i>as tight as you can stand them.</i>

647
01:29:00,969 --> 01:29:04,605
- I can hardly breathe.
- <i>Gun?</i>

648
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,435
I've got one.
Not that I've ever used it.

649
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:29,694
The other division's coming in above us.
How does the field look, Harry?

650
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:33,162
- You pick them real good, CAG.
- Jettison your canopy.

651
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:40,797
<i>Get out fast, Harry.</i>
<i>No matter what happens, get out fast!</i>

652
01:34:35,269 --> 01:34:37,237
Forney!

653
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:58,158
Nestor!

654
01:35:00,561 --> 01:35:02,028
Nestor.

655
01:35:03,299 --> 01:35:05,866
Nestor.

656
01:35:38,999 --> 01:35:41,968
And they was gonna
give nestor a medal too.

657
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,289
How much longer can them ADs stay?

658
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:07,917
Not very long.
They must be running out of ammunition.

659
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:13,194
They won't send another helicopter now,
not after dark.

660
01:36:13,400 --> 01:36:17,530
If we can hold out through the night,
they'll find us in the morning.
Here, you better take this.

661
01:36:21,642 --> 01:36:26,745
You know how to fire a carbine, sir? Just
release the safety and squeeze the trigger.
It fires automatic until you stop fire.

662
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:30,410
I'm a lawyer from Denver, Colorado, Mike.
I probably can't hit a thing.

663
01:36:31,886 --> 01:36:36,248
Judas! How did you ever get out here
in a smelly ditch in Korea?

664
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:39,751
That's just what I've been asking myself.

665
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:23,425
Better get these things off.
Too good a target.

666
01:37:37,951 --> 01:37:40,816
"The wrong war in the wrong place,
and that's the one you're stuck with."

667
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:43,713
What did you say, Lieutenant?

668
01:37:44,124 --> 01:37:47,451
Did you ever hear Admiral Tarrant
go on about this war?

669
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:50,528
About the chosen few
who have to lay it on the line?

670
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:53,996
Nestor and me never done much
fraternised with the admirals.

671
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:03,636
I can see now he was right.
You fight simply because you're here.

672
01:38:54,595 --> 01:38:56,563
Watch out, Lieutenant!

673
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:57,712
- Where's Lee?
- He's waiting on the bridge, sir.

674
01:40:04,131 --> 01:40:08,700
- <i>Admiral from CIC.</i>
- Go ahead.

675
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:12,861
<i>Just received final report, sir,</i>
<i>authenticated by Army Intelligence.</i>

676
01:40:13,273 --> 01:40:17,510
<i>Jet aircraft crashed.</i>
<i>Helicopter shot down.</i>

677
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:21,545
<i>Three Americans killed</i>
<i>by Communist troops.</i>

678
01:40:28,389 --> 01:40:32,985
- Why was Brubaker abandoned?
- Admiral, we kept a rescap
over him as long as we could.

679
01:40:33,193 --> 01:40:35,791
If one helicopter crashed,
why didn't you call in another?

680
01:40:35,996 --> 01:40:40,826
I called in the downed-pilot
condition report before I was
forced to leave. My fuel was low.

681
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,464
The first helicopter hadn't even arrived.
There was nothing more that I could do.

682
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:48,065
- Was Brubaker hit at the bridges?
- No, sir, at our secondary target.

683
01:40:48,276 --> 01:40:52,141
We got the bridges. We still had bombs left
so we went to work on the fuel dump.

684
01:40:52,346 --> 01:40:57,677
- Was that good judgment?
- Admiral, this was a good mission.
We did everything just right.

685
01:40:57,885 --> 01:41:03,448
I put Brubaker in charge of the third
division because I knew he would fly low
and bore in with the bombs. He did just that.

686
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:07,753
I don't care what kind of fitness report
you give me. This was a good mission!

687
01:41:07,961 --> 01:41:13,456
It cost the lives of three men:
Forney, Gamidge, and Brubaker.

688
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:19,465
I know how you feel. But what
makes you think you're the only one.

689
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:24,838
He may have been your boy, Admiral,
but he was my boy, too! I lost him.

690
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:41,623
You're right, CAG.
You're right.

691
01:41:56,710 --> 01:42:02,615
I was wrong about CAG, Evans.
He's a good man. A good man.

692
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:07,948
I'd like to write Brubaker's wife,
but what can you say, are you?

693
01:42:08,555 --> 01:42:12,016
Explain this to the mother of two little girls.

694
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:15,054
<i>Prepare to launch jets.</i>

695
01:42:18,132 --> 01:42:20,960
Where do we get such men?

696
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:26,298
They leave this ship
and they do their job.

697
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:32,634
Then they must find this speck
lost somewhere on the sea.

698
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:37,806
When they find it,
they have to land on its pitching deck.

699
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:43,854
- Where do we get such men?
- <i>Launch jets.</i>

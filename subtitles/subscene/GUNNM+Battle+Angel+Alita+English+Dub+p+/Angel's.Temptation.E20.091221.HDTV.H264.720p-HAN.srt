00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,540
Temptation Of An Angel

3
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:29,609
Honey!

4
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:43,187
Jae Hee!

5
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:47,832
Episode 20

6
00:00:45,368 --> 00:00:46,815
Where did you go, that
you're only returning now?

7
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,645
Do you know how worried I was?

8
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:54,347
It's a relief, that you're all right.

9
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:58,101
I'm tired, I'm going to rest.

10
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:01,697
I know it's tiring for you,

11
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:04,888
but there's no evidence, why do you
have to have suspicions first?

12
00:01:05,008 --> 00:01:09,551
Didn't Manager Jung say,
all the screws were loosened,

13
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:12,806
if it wasn't intentional, how could
something like that happen?

14
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:17,168
If you believe that, Jae Hee, then there's
nothing that we can do about it.

15
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:19,497
Please don't be moved anymore.

16
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:21,497
Didn't you say you would believe me,
and go all the way with me?

17
00:01:21,617 --> 00:01:25,858
Even so, how could I change
the fact that I'm Joo Kyeong Ran?

18
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:28,934
Just like Ahjusshi isn't
Ahn Jae Sung, but Shin Hyun Woo,

19
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:31,763
the blood in our bodies
cannot be changed.

20
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:38,054
<i>Mother</i>

21
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:41,921
Yes, Mother.

22
00:01:43,432 --> 00:01:45,049
Why are you crying?

23
00:01:46,517 --> 00:01:47,432
What?

24
00:01:52,038 --> 00:01:55,751
What happened? Why did an
accident suddenly happen?!

25
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:59,240
Madam jumped into traffic,
in order to save her...

26
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,390
Mom, why did you do that?

27
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,829
Were you afraid that Dad would blame you,

28
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,837
so you wanted to kill him yourself?

29
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,797
<i>Is that it?!</i>

30
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,350
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:12,116
Stop saying sorry!

32
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,535
You hid the fact that you gave birth to
Joo Seung Hyun from Dad for thirty years,

33
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,747
to Mom, is there anything
else that is real?!

34
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:20,556
- Mom, you're a hypocrite too!
- Stop it!

35
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,833
Dad is still lying in the operating theatre.

36
00:02:22,953 --> 00:02:26,081
Do you think he'll feel
good if he hears us arguing?

37
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,166
Oppa, you should be the one to stop it.

38
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:30,932
It's because of Joo Ah Ran
that our family is in this state.

39
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,762
<i>Why did you bring Joo Ah Ran's sister here?</i>

40
00:02:33,882 --> 00:02:35,382
Take that woman away immediately!

41
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,956
Shin Hyun Ji!

42
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:43,999
Doctor! How's the situation?

43
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:45,636
He should be fine after
the operation, right?

44
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,785
Is he really badly hurt?

45
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,828
When the accident happened, his spinal
nerves suffered a great amount of damage,

46
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:54,636
<i>and there was a lot of bleeding,</i>

47
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:57,067
the situation isn't good.

48
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,173
What does that mean?

49
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:02,152
My father...
Will he die?

50
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,897
Doctor...

51
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,342
no matter what, please save him.

52
00:03:06,462 --> 00:03:08,597
It doesn't matter what happens to me,

53
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:12,533
you can take anything from my body.

54
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,278
Doctor, as long as you can save him,

55
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:17,841
it doesn't matter what condition he is in.

56
00:03:17,961 --> 00:03:20,671
Let Ah Ran take me away!

57
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:24,224
The one who is guilty is me,
why is he being punished?

58
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:30,293
Ah Ran made a mistake,
she punished the wrong person.

59
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,581
<i>How about the car?</i>

60
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:56,438
I abandoned it, and ran away.
I've been taking the subway.

61
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,775
Good job.

62
00:03:57,895 --> 00:03:59,735
Even though it's tiring,
hold on for a while more.

63
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:01,501
No matter if it's Hyun Woo
Hyung or President,

64
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,524
we can't let them do anything, we have
to prepare for it, and then retaliate.

65
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,602
Shin Hyun Woo wasn't even in the villa,

66
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,679
how could they say we attempted
to kill someone by setting the fire?

67
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,190
Even then, there is no
evidence that I set the fire.

68
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,977
Even so, that side has
the black box from the car.

69
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:18,062
With that evidence, we can't escape,

70
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,758
it's enough to convict us
of attempted murder.

71
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,099
This feels like when I was 18 again.

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,909
I knew that Aunt was going
to sell me to a forty year old man,

73
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,739
I was hiding everywhere like
a crazy person the whole night.

74
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:40,624
I really don't want to remember the feeling
of being chased everywhere again.

75
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,198
No matter what, we have to push
Hyun Woo Hyung into desperation,

76
00:04:43,318 --> 00:04:45,964
so he'll stop pursuing you.

77
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:49,602
Even if he's convicted of identity theft,

78
00:04:49,608 --> 00:04:51,091
he will never let you off.

79
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:54,373
The spinal nerves are severely damaged,

80
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:58,075
looks like he'll be paralyzed
from the waist down.

81
00:04:58,841 --> 00:04:59,883
What?

82
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:02,272
Paralyzed from the waist down?

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,016
Honey.

84
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:06,187
<i>It'll be a great blow to him.</i>

85
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:10,995
How about hiding it from the patient first?

86
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,529
Then, I'll leave first.

87
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,721
Father!

88
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,519
<i>How could our Father...</i>

89
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,114
<i>He lived by his pride all along.</i>

90
00:05:26,234 --> 00:05:29,182
Betrayed by his wife,
and now unable to walk,

91
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:31,756
how is he going to live?

92
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,245
Hyun Woo.

93
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,458
Yes, Father.

94
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,267
Are you awake?

95
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:41,874
Can you recognize me?

96
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:43,611
-Father.
- Dad.

97
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:47,207
Where's your mother?

98
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,335
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,735
I didn't die, and I'm still alive.

100
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,884
It's good that you're still alive.

101
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,267
If you died,

102
00:05:58,387 --> 00:06:02,449
I would follow you all the
way to hell to torture you.

103
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:06,236
Why did you save me?
You should have just let me die.

104
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:11,258
You made me guilty for the rest of my life,
how am I going to face you?

105
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:13,722
I'm fine.

106
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,956
Shin Woo Sub...

107
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,573
will not die like that.

108
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:26,966
<i>If you were hit, your bones
might not been left behind.</i>

109
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,796
That's why I survived.

110
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,690
Dad, don't talk too much.

111
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,857
You had a big surgery,
so you have to rest more.

112
00:06:36,368 --> 00:06:39,049
What surgery did I have?

113
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,666
Look, I can even talk now.

114
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:46,051
It means my injuries aren't too bad.

115
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:50,860
<i>Your mother can stay,
the rest of you can go back.</i>

116
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,434
<i>It's too noisy.</i>

117
00:07:06,809 --> 00:07:09,001
What's the matter in
the middle of the night?

118
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:11,533
Did something change?

119
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:16,262
President Shin Woo Sub,
is in the hospital right now.

120
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:20,517
He's paralyzed from the waist down,
because of a traffic accident.

121
00:07:21,257 --> 00:07:22,922
What?

122
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,257
In the end, God still punished him.

123
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:33,618
But, it's not enough.

124
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,727
Compared to what he did,
this is only the beginning.

125
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:40,472
I beg you, please stop.
How far do you want to go?

126
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,238
No matter what he did, the pain he's
suffering right now is enough.

127
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:47,177
Just that little pain, and you
can't watch any further?

128
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,879
That person...

129
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:52,964
has enjoyed what our parents
couldn't for the past 25 years.

130
00:07:53,691 --> 00:07:56,785
Property, glory, he's taken it all.

131
00:07:58,253 --> 00:08:03,700
Now, even if he's on a wheelchair,
at least he won't be begging on the streets.

132
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,572
So, you hope the President dies?

133
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:10,988
Then, our dead parents can come back?

134
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,626
What is it that you want?

135
00:08:13,746 --> 00:08:17,264
The days you lost, you won't be able
to find them back through revenge.

136
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,850
You will only lose more through
the process of your revenge!

137
00:08:19,891 --> 00:08:22,616
Revenge is not about seeking out the past.

138
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,829
But it's the reason for my life now.

139
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:33,056
The reason why I'm living now,
is for Dad and Mom.

140
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:36,970
No, more accurately,

141
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:41,761
Look at us right now.

142
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:48,752
You're being pursued for crimes,

143
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:54,220
and I can't even meet
the person that I love.

144
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,214
Is this the way our
parents wanted to see us?

145
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:00,151
<i>I beg you,</i>

146
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,172
if you want me to return as Kyeong Ran,

147
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,459
go look for Shin Hyun Woo
and beg for his forgiveness.

148
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:08,736
<i>Then,</i>

149
00:09:08,856 --> 00:09:11,523
I'll give up the marriage too.

150
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:22,960
What a fool.

151
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:32,339
I have no confidence to stay by your side,

152
00:09:32,636 --> 00:09:35,487
and no face to see the children.

153
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:40,900
The day you're discharged, please let me go.

154
00:09:41,219 --> 00:09:44,006
Where can you go?

155
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:51,181
I want you to stay by my side, and serve
me till the day my coffin lid is shut.

156
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:59,087
Is it because I'm an invalid,
that you want to abandon me?

157
00:10:00,385 --> 00:10:03,269
Just shout it out like you used to.

158
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:08,134
<i>Joo Seung is my child, and I turned
you into this, why are you so calm?</i>

159
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:10,921
Hate me, scold me to your heart's content!

160
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,389
The way you are right now...

161
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:18,784
it's making me so pressured,
I can't breathe!

162
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,380
<i>Honey.</i>

163
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,210
Joo Seung is your child,

164
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,508
I knew that a long time ago.

165
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:30,948
What did you say?

166
00:10:31,068 --> 00:10:34,361
When I came back from business,

167
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:39,020
Secretary Nam told me that Joo Seung
was his child, and brought him to me.

168
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:44,771
<i>But it was really strange.</i>

169
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,558
The minute I saw him,

170
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,537
I felt like he was my child.

171
00:10:56,942 --> 00:11:03,289
The child that my wife
gives birth is my child.

172
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,311
What other way can there be?

173
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,566
Honey.

174
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:11,034
<i>When I got up at night,</i>

175
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,469
and saw you crying at night,

176
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:21,511
the fact that I won't be
able to forgive you is true,

177
00:11:22,737 --> 00:11:27,844
but I really feel something
for that kid Joo Seung too.

178
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,354
Ho...

179
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,599
Honey.

180
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:38,003
I'm wrong, honey.

181
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:45,122
I thought you would neglect
this crude and rough husband,

182
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,833
but looks like you hated me with a passion,

183
00:11:48,953 --> 00:11:54,492
<i>and even had a son with Secretary
Nam who was closest to me,</i>

184
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,620
and took revenge on me.

185
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,208
That's how much you hated me?

186
00:12:04,101 --> 00:12:06,889
Why didn't you say anything?

187
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,956
Why didn't you tell me you knew everything?

188
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,978
I lived in fear that you
would find out every day,

189
00:12:17,659 --> 00:12:20,382
it really wasn't a life at all.

190
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,445
If I told you I knew,

191
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:28,764
then you wouldn't be by my side.

192
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:35,525
And, you would take Joo Seung,
to a place where I couldn't find you.

193
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:44,072
The Joo Seung now, doesn't treat
us like parents but enemies.

194
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:48,583
<i>He wants to kill Hyun Woo,
and steal Hyun Woo's woman too.</i>

195
00:12:48,703 --> 00:12:55,206
It's all because of me, the children I
birthed, are bleeding and battling.

196
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,126
This crime, how am I going to redeem myself,

197
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,785
how?!

198
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,296
<i>How?!</i>

199
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:19,363
Call an emergency meeting,
and call another credit bank.

200
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,174
No matter what, we have to
gather all our liquid assets,

201
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,938
and exchange it for an extended credit date.

202
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:25,579
Also, make an appointment with another bank.

203
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:30,047
After hearing what happened to the President,
the credit banks are getting uneasy.

204
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:32,409
We have to do all we can.

205
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,302
Do as I tell you.

206
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:48,934
The creditors' response seems
to be pretty favorable.

207
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:51,774
- Have you contacted the bank yet?
- Yes.

208
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,454
This is Shin Hyun Woo.

209
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:58,439
Yes?

210
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,613
The police station?

211
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,696
Shin Hyun Woo, you said
that your wife Joo Ah Ran,

212
00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:07,800
wanted to kill her paralyzed
husband, so she set the fire.

213
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:10,130
Yes, that's true.

214
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:13,491
Then, who is the Shin Hyun Woo
who is sitting in front of me right now?

215
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:17,218
In your vegetative state,
how did you escape the fire?

216
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:21,087
And looking at the evidence that
the Yang Pyeong police just sent over,

217
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:27,151
there was a silicone wig found in the villa.

218
00:14:27,271 --> 00:14:31,172
Does that mean, you pretended
you were in a vegetative state?

219
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:38,781
The fact that I woke up,
Joo Ah Ran was aware of this.

220
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:43,309
That's why she locked all the doors
from outside, and turned the gas on.

221
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,990
First of all, we will cooperate with the
Yang Pyeong villa to investigate this case,

222
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,011
<i>and we also have to find hard
evidence that Joo Ah Ran is a criminal.</i>

223
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,450
I will cooperate with you.

224
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:53,324
Oh, right.

225
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:55,152
According to Joo Ah Ran's statement,

226
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,323
Shin Hyun Woo, you used Ahn Jae
Sung's name to work before.

227
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:02,408
You do realize that constitutes
identity theft and fraud, right?

228
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:23,124
<i>You're under investigation
so early in the morning.</i>

229
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:27,844
Ah Ran and I, will definitely
not die by ourselves.

230
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:32,695
No matter what, we will catch Hyung and President
by the throats, and fall in the water together.

231
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:34,270
What?

232
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,300
You despicable person.

233
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,388
Father is still lying in
the hospital from his accident,

234
00:15:39,508 --> 00:15:44,240
<i>and you want to play this jealous game,
because your mother got snatched away?</i>

235
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,431
What?

236
00:15:46,793 --> 00:15:47,963
President...

237
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:49,325
traffic accident?

238
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:51,375
Why? When?

239
00:15:51,495 --> 00:15:53,120
Listen carefully.

240
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,503
The crimes that I committed under Ahn Jae Sung,
I'm ready to accept punishment for them.

241
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,013
I won't negotiate with people
like you in order to avoid this crime.

242
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:02,580
<i>Joo Ah Ran and you,</i>

243
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,835
I'll make you stand in front of the judges.

244
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:14,161
President...

245
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:17,808
He was in a traffic accident?

246
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:20,098
<i>We don't need to say anything else.</i>

247
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,012
Look at this photograph,

248
00:16:22,132 --> 00:16:23,675
and if you still want to marry that person,

249
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:26,271
we won't stop you.

250
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:38,743
Dad.

251
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:42,488
Mom.

252
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:51,454
Aigoo. When they were children,
Ah Ran and Kyeong Ran were so close.

253
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,784
<i>They never fought,</i>

254
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:59,752
<i>and Ah Ran took care of Kyeong Ran
like a mother, wasn't that right?</i>

255
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:01,625
That's right.

256
00:17:01,745 --> 00:17:07,687
Blood is thicker than water, how could
Kyeong Ran not take care of her family?

257
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:12,041
<i>Then, is she a beast or a human?</i>

258
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:15,267
So, my dad and mom looks like that.

259
00:17:16,778 --> 00:17:17,735
Eyes,

260
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,087
<i>nose,</i>

261
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,491
mouth,

262
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:24,597
is so similar to mine.

263
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,476
How could I have lived till now,
without knowing?

264
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:42,358
Actually, your father, is a person
whose fingernail doesn't even look like mine.

265
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,529
He was so proper, as a President.

266
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,401
Oh, my Hyung.

267
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:53,683
Aigoo, looking at this,
I should have died first.

268
00:17:53,803 --> 00:17:57,002
What are you saying?

269
00:17:57,122 --> 00:17:59,978
<i>If you left, how would I survive?</i>

270
00:18:00,098 --> 00:18:01,573
Kyeong Ran,

271
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:07,063
on behalf of your parents,
you can't forget your sister either.

272
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:12,726
If you listen to me, from now on,
you have to live differently from before.

273
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:16,839
<i>The furniture, the showroom,
I'm not asking for anything.</i>

274
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,583
This person,
did you drink too much?

275
00:18:19,703 --> 00:18:23,743
Since we're born onto this earth,
we have to live like people.

276
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,203
These people...

277
00:18:57,288 --> 00:19:00,842
Where has everyone gone,
leaving the patient alone?

278
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:06,745
I don't wish to talk to you.
You get out of here immediately.

279
00:19:07,474 --> 00:19:10,793
Even so, you can't abuse
someone who came to visit you.

280
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:17,378
It was a little inappropriate to come
empty-handed, so I bought some flowers.

281
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,910
I'm sorry you're in this state.

282
00:19:21,147 --> 00:19:24,211
What are you trying to do now?

283
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:28,807
Why did Joo Chul Min's
family come to visit me?

284
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,714
Didn't you hear me when I said to get out?

285
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:36,622
I heard you were paralyzed from the waist down,
but your temper hasn't changed a bit.

286
00:19:37,031 --> 00:19:42,633
But don't misunderstand,
that you can cover your past.

287
00:19:42,753 --> 00:19:43,863
Ah Ran.

288
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,097
What?

289
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:49,118
Who's paralyzed from the waist down?

290
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:52,297
You still don't know?

291
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:59,594
What you did 25 years ago,
how it has come back to you?

292
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:07,869
What is going on?

293
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,689
What is going on?

294
00:20:11,136 --> 00:20:13,327
Who turned my legs into such a state?

295
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:14,987
Was it you?!

296
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,703
<i>My...</i>

297
00:20:17,823 --> 00:20:19,426
<i>My legs!</i>

298
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,490
Your shadow won't grow longer anymore.

299
00:20:23,915 --> 00:20:26,894
How much of your assets you
have gained by underhand methods,

300
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:30,254
is how deep the evidence of your crimes.

301
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,062
Father, what is going on?

302
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:35,977
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

303
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:38,245
Do you not know Father's
condition right now?

304
00:20:38,365 --> 00:20:41,968
Who did something to my body?

305
00:20:42,088 --> 00:20:45,196
Return it to me!

306
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:46,491
I can't live like this!

307
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:51,554
You should have just let me die on the bed,
why did you save me?!

308
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,015
<i>Honey!</i>

309
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,645
Just blame me, I thought
you would feel better.

310
00:20:57,765 --> 00:20:59,645
Who wants to die?

311
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:04,686
you have to hang on
all the way till the end.

312
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,452
<i>President has to spend
his entire life on a wheelchair,</i>

313
00:21:07,572 --> 00:21:10,261
<i>to redeem the crime
of killing Ah Ran's parents.</i>

314
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:13,570
<i>Madam, you have to push President
in a wheelchair your entire life,</i>

315
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,562
<i>to redeem the crime of abandoning me.</i>

316
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,147
Get out now.

317
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:24,856
I don't want to see you.

318
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,303
Disappear!

319
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:37,320
Stop being so petulant.

320
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,661
Were you the only one on this earth who
was abandoned by your parents?!

321
00:21:43,022 --> 00:21:46,665
At least you still had your father,
and had such a good education.

322
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:49,027
Even if a bad seed was planted,

323
00:21:49,147 --> 00:21:52,282
a child who would pull a
knife against his mother,

324
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:53,686
there is none in the world.

325
00:21:53,806 --> 00:21:55,197
Let me go!

326
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:59,480
Do you think I'm pushing the
blame because I didn't get a toy?!

327
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,182
I, wasn't abandoned,
but brutally killed.

328
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:08,428
but brutally killed. At least, Madam
killed me brutally countless times in her dreams.

329
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:11,833
<i>I lived like this my entire life,
walking around as a ticking bomb,</i>

330
00:22:11,953 --> 00:22:15,716
how much anger and unease
she must have felt.

331
00:22:15,836 --> 00:22:17,929
The feeling of being pushed
away by your mother,

332
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,206
does Hyung know?

333
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,248
Joo Seung, your hate,

334
00:22:26,725 --> 00:22:28,722
I'll help you unleash it.

335
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:34,148
This is Soul's last check.

336
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:36,542
<i>You personally hand out the last invoice.</i>

337
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:41,645
If you can't get it paid by today,
Soul will be bankrupt.

338
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:45,092
Joo Ah Ran.

339
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,990
What are you going to do?

340
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:51,883
I want to give you the chance
to push Soul down.

341
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,585
I understand.

342
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,918
I'll do it.

343
00:22:59,216 --> 00:23:00,386
All right.

344
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,684
You want to fight to the end, right?

345
00:23:05,227 --> 00:23:07,099
Then I have no choice.

346
00:23:08,248 --> 00:23:12,823
I delayed time, to give you and
Jae Hee time to reconcile.

347
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:15,461
Looks like there isn't a need.

348
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,039
The black box in the car,

349
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,456
and the fingerprints from
the Yang Pyeong villa are in here.

350
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:32,775
As long as I turn this to the police,
the two of you are over.

351
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:37,328
All right, go ahead,

352
00:23:37,448 --> 00:23:43,243
I think you want to give the President
in a wheelchair a last present.

353
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,690
We'll do as you wish.

354
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:46,520
<i>Stop it.</i>

355
00:23:46,818 --> 00:23:48,882
I'll just go die.

356
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:51,052
Stop all this revenge!

357
00:23:51,172 --> 00:23:54,988
The children I gave birth to,
are biting at each other and arguing,

358
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,265
I can't watch this anymore.

359
00:23:57,385 --> 00:23:59,234
This isn't life, this is hell!

360
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,979
<i>This hell!</i>

361
00:24:01,575 --> 00:24:04,362
Was created by President and Madam.

362
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:12,071
I will always help Ah Ran, to redeem all the
crimes President committed 25 years ago.

363
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:23,495
Mother.
Mother!

364
00:25:17,741 --> 00:25:22,050
It's time to go for a checkup,
I'll bring you over in a wheelchair!

365
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,518
Don't help me!

366
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,241
I can do this.

367
00:25:28,896 --> 00:25:33,662
Do you think, that I can't
even move my own body?

368
00:25:34,002 --> 00:25:37,151
Don't look down on Shin Woo Sub!

369
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,985
- Are you fine?
- Let me go!

370
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:53,165
I can do this.

371
00:25:54,144 --> 00:25:55,633
I can do this.

372
00:25:55,753 --> 00:25:57,676
I can walk.

373
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:17,285
What happened?

374
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:20,157
Didn't you say that there
weren't any more invoices to pay?

375
00:26:22,348 --> 00:26:26,057
It's an invoice that Joo Ah Ran filled, selling
furniture to other companies at lowered costs.

376
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:28,333
The cost is about 13 hundred million.

377
00:26:30,912 --> 00:26:33,503
The bank can't help us anymore.

378
00:26:35,378 --> 00:26:39,165
Oh right, a letter came for
President Shin Hyun Woo this afternoon.

379
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,215
<i>Ahjusshi,</i>

380
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,470
<i>even though I want to deny it,</i>

381
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:57,695
<i>I can't help the fact
that I am Joo Kyeong Ran.</i>

382
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,589
<i>At this moment, I feel
like I understand my Unnie.</i>

383
00:27:04,397 --> 00:27:09,964
<i>Even if I start my life anew now,
I might become like her.</i>

384
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:15,682
<i>Please, forgive all the crimes
my Unnie committed.</i>

385
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:22,789
<i>The period where I loved Ahjusshi,
I was really happy.</i>

386
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:48,042
This...

387
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:50,431
is Kyeong Ran's shoes.

388
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,176
Why did Kyeong Ran give these to me?

389
00:27:55,296 --> 00:27:59,926
Maybe she means she
doesn't want to come back.

390
00:28:01,543 --> 00:28:04,287
Does that mean she chose Shin Hyun Woo?

391
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:14,751
Kyeong Ran was my last hope.

392
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,357
In the end, this dream too,
was cruelly crushed by them.

393
00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:24,336
Now, there's no reason to hold back.

394
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:29,081
Send the invoice over,
and bankrupt Soul.

395
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:33,987
Open the door.

396
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:35,497
I know you're in there,

397
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:38,348
I have something to ask,
open the door!

398
00:28:41,478 --> 00:28:44,435
After we told him we were going to
send the invoice, he seems pretty desperate.

399
00:28:50,532 --> 00:28:53,063
<i>Madam.</i>

400
00:29:03,261 --> 00:29:05,559
Is there anything else to say?

401
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:11,957
That invoice, do you
really have to change it?

402
00:29:12,787 --> 00:29:15,362
Do you really have to bankrupt Soul?

403
00:29:16,383 --> 00:29:20,213
In the end, you came to
beg me for the company.

404
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:24,189
On my behalf, couldn't you just
tolerate it one more time?

405
00:29:24,309 --> 00:29:26,763
<i>No matter what, to Hyun Woo,
and Hyun Woo's father,</i>

406
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,763
Soul is something very important.

407
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:33,757
I beg you, please, Joo Seung.

408
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:35,991
Hyun Woo,

409
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:37,779
Hyun Woo,

410
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:39,544
Hyun Woo.

411
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,781
When are you going to
stop talking about Hyun Woo?!

412
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:46,589
<i>I'm also a child that you birthed painfully.</i>

413
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:51,036
Why am I not worth the dust
on Hyun Woo Hyung's fingernails?

414
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:54,480
Why can't you see the metal
stake that is pierced through my heart?

415
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,012
It's all right how much you hate me.

416
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:01,236
As long as you let Soul go,

417
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:05,385
I can tolerate it, even if you throw
rocks at me, or step on me.

418
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:09,848
You might as well just kill me here,
just don't touch the other family members.

419
00:30:09,968 --> 00:30:12,167
You mean that because of Hyun Woo,

420
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:15,571
you can sacrifice anything?

421
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,740
That means, that I can't agree to it.

422
00:30:19,071 --> 00:30:25,028
Hyun Woo, I must see the way
he kneels in front of me and begs me.

423
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,550
There is something you don't know!

424
00:30:29,057 --> 00:30:34,034
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,
wasn't Hyun Woo's father, but me.

425
00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:40,723
What?

426
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:44,574
Ah Ran's parents' accident,
was caused by me.

427
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:46,981
The person who loosened the screws was me,

428
00:30:47,101 --> 00:30:50,662
and the person who ran away when
the Manager sat on the forklift was also me.

429
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,449
I killed him.

430
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:54,641
I planned all of it.

431
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,841
Stop lying.

432
00:30:56,961 --> 00:31:00,033
What reason would you
have to kill Ah Ran's parents?

433
00:31:02,053 --> 00:31:05,182
You wanted to pin the President's crime
on your head, that's why you said that, right?

434
00:31:05,302 --> 00:31:07,093
Ah Ran's father,

435
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:10,455
knew about the relationship
between me and your father.

436
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:13,061
He coincidentally heard that
we had a special relationship,

437
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:16,242
and even had a child.

438
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:21,219
Ah Ran's father was fighting with Hyun Woo's
father every day, because of poor materials.

439
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:26,605
I was afraid, he would spill
my secret in the end.

440
00:31:26,725 --> 00:31:29,499
So you killed the factory manager?

441
00:31:29,924 --> 00:31:32,392
Are you expecting me to
believe this right now?

442
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:34,797
Your deceased father,

443
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:37,978
knew this too.

444
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,106
What?

445
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:45,489
After he found out that
I killed Ah Ran's parents,

446
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,202
he felt very guilty,

447
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:51,691
that's why,

448
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:54,551
he asked you to take care
of Ah Ran after his death.

449
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,359
No.

450
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:04,455
Now you know?

451
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,737
The person that Ah Ran needs to seek revenge
on isn't Hyun Woo, or Hyun Woo's father, but me.

452
00:32:09,857 --> 00:32:12,439
The mother that gave birth to you.

453
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,482
No,

454
00:32:15,014 --> 00:32:15,929
no,

455
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:18,397
no!

456
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:21,342
I handed over Kyeong Ran to the orphanage,

457
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:24,555
because I felt guilty
about killing her parents.

458
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:27,917
Because I felt guilty
for destroying a family,

459
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:30,789
I've never had a peaceful day.

460
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:35,980
Stop lying.

461
00:32:38,001 --> 00:32:39,490
It's not possible.

462
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,324
Don't even say another word!

463
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:31,923
<i>But Hyun Woo Hyung isn't guilty.</i>

464
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,232
Being born by such parents is a crime.

465
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,189
When I was serving alcohol to old men,

466
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:43,821
that man, should have been
sleeping in a comfortable house.

467
00:33:45,715 --> 00:33:48,779
Let the forgiving words be
carried away by dogs.

468
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:16,965
Joo Ah Ran.

469
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,114
Don't resent me.

470
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,539
The crimes you committed will be punished.

471
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:25,821
I've always hesitated because you were
the sister that Kyeong Ran missed,

472
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:31,247
but you've pushed me to the end,
there's nothing else to hold on to.

473
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:41,756
What?

474
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:45,075
Mother was the one who
tampered with the forklift?

475
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,554
Could it be...

476
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:49,234
It's true.

477
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:54,171
I was afraid my past would be exposed,

478
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,788
so I killed Ah Ran's father.

479
00:34:56,908 --> 00:34:59,554
Besides killing him, I didn't know any
other way I could shut his mouth.

480
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:01,447
That can't be.

481
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:03,730
How could such a soft-hearted
person like Mom...

482
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,454
I wasn't myself then.

483
00:35:07,896 --> 00:35:11,480
I could only think of saving Joo Seung.

484
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,459
If your father knew...

485
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:19,746
I thought he would kill Joo Seung.

486
00:35:21,703 --> 00:35:23,554
Then in the end,

487
00:35:24,278 --> 00:35:26,703
Joo Ah Ran was right?

488
00:35:27,117 --> 00:35:29,329
<i>Our family to Joo Ah Ran,</i>

489
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:32,968
is an enemy that can't even be revenged?

490
00:35:33,205 --> 00:35:35,053
My mother,

491
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:38,003
because she was afraid her
own family would be split apart,

492
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:42,067
was someone who destroyed
someone else's family, is that it?

493
00:35:42,748 --> 00:35:44,195
I'm sorry.

494
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:47,152
Can you use sorry to forget everything?

495
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,701
Two innocent people died,

496
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:56,542
and two children were orphaned Jae Hee's
parents who died, not even knowing the reason,

497
00:35:56,662 --> 00:36:00,555
and the pain that Joo Ah Ran
and Jae Hee suffered for 25 years,

498
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:03,336
how are you going to repay that?

499
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:05,854
How are you going to redeem yourself?

500
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:10,858
What do you want me to do, you tell me.

501
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:13,622
<i>I don't even have the right to die now.</i>

502
00:36:13,742 --> 00:36:18,945
Turning your father into this state,
where else can I hide?

503
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:21,534
Why did you do that?

504
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,195
My mother,

505
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,642
how could she do something so scary?

506
00:36:27,762 --> 00:36:30,749
I know I have no right to say this to you,

507
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:36,787
but, can you let Ah Ran go?

508
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:41,043
Then, what would my life become?

509
00:36:42,404 --> 00:36:44,532
The pain of dying,

510
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:47,271
<i>the pain of plastic surgery,</i>

511
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:50,845
was all for putting my
life on the line for revenge.

512
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:55,654
Now for Mother, you want
me to put everything away?

513
00:36:56,807 --> 00:36:58,552
I can't do that.

514
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:03,714
Mother's crime, you take
on the responsibility.

515
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:10,242
Don't take your heinous crimes,
and leave any of it for your children.

516
00:37:11,974 --> 00:37:14,550
I'll do whatever I wish to do.

517
00:37:54,243 --> 00:37:56,556
I want to hand over concrete
evidence of the traffic accident

518
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:59,881
and the fire at the Yang
Pyeong villa to you, Officer.

519
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:01,331
If you look at this,

520
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:05,228
you will know who the two
people who committed the crimes are.

521
00:38:05,348 --> 00:38:07,167
Concrete evidence?

522
00:38:07,971 --> 00:38:09,676
What is it?

523
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:21,472
Mother killed that woman's parents.

524
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:25,778
Now, how am I going to punish that woman?

525
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,655
Pulling out a knife against Joo Ah Ran,

526
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:32,809
is equivalent to pulling
out a knife against Mother.

527
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,855
<i>Nam Joo Seung.</i>

528
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:07,605
Hyung, you know too?

529
00:39:08,266 --> 00:39:12,117
The criminal 25 years ago, was Madam.

530
00:39:12,237 --> 00:39:14,120
What do you want to say?

531
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,954
Was it,

532
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,726
Hyung who asked Madam to come look for me?

533
00:39:21,422 --> 00:39:24,236
You thought if I knew my mother did it,

534
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:26,559
everything would become ugly?

535
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:27,923
What?

536
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:31,440
Don't have any hopes for me.

537
00:39:31,794 --> 00:39:35,780
No matter what, I was a beast my
mother refused to acknowledge.

538
00:39:36,313 --> 00:39:38,849
Now, or in the future,

539
00:39:39,824 --> 00:39:42,444
I'll make any decisions for me and Ah Ran.

540
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:46,003
I came to say all this.

541
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:49,592
Saying that, does your heart feel better?

542
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,579
Looks like you don't want to acknowledge
your mother, and stay by the woman you love

543
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:57,492
That doesn't change anything at all.

544
00:39:57,776 --> 00:40:00,872
You're the son of Jo Kyung Hee,
who killed Joo Ah Ran's parents.

545
00:40:03,952 --> 00:40:06,067
Hyung, you're the same too.

546
00:40:06,749 --> 00:40:09,286
Didn't you overlook the
enmity between both our families,

547
00:40:10,373 --> 00:40:12,504
and love Yoon Jae Hee?

548
00:40:12,624 --> 00:40:15,104
But, at least I'm not denying the past.

549
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:19,358
I'll beg Jae Hee to forgive Mom.

550
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:23,301
Till my hands are scraped raw,

551
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,930
till my kneecaps are begged through,
till the day my heart stops,

552
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,319
I'll beg for Jae Hee's forgiveness.

553
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:36,410
Isn't that the last thing
I can do for the woman I love?

554
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,860
No.

555
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,929
I won't tell Ah Ran anything.

556
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:43,593
From the beginning she wasn't my mother.

557
00:40:44,046 --> 00:40:49,076
Now she says she's my mother
and wants me to carry around such shame.

558
00:40:49,374 --> 00:40:51,612
<i>Isn't that too despicable?</i>

559
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,937
The good days are over.

560
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:58,784
Why is she coming back as a criminal?

561
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,306
Even though we can't
overlook Mother's crimes,

562
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,354
but, you can't accuse Mother.

563
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:10,440
The choice that Mother made then,
was because of you.

564
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,552
Stop saying such irresponsible things.

565
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,451
In order to keep the secret from Dad,

566
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:19,712
she did such a horrible thing
to Ah Ran's parents.

567
00:41:19,832 --> 00:41:22,356
<i>To prevent her child from
being swallowed alive,</i>

568
00:41:22,476 --> 00:41:24,935
she went to bite other people's children.

569
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:27,769
That was only a choice Madam made.

570
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:30,335
I didn't do anything.

571
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,253
I'm clean.

572
00:41:32,373 --> 00:41:36,069
I don't wish, because of Madam,
to become a criminal.

573
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:44,350
This is Ah Ran's last invoice.

574
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:48,719
I'm going to change this invoice right now.

575
00:41:49,444 --> 00:41:53,800
What Ah Ran hopes for,
is what I hope for.

576
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,597
Are you ready?

577
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,155
<i>You are the son of Jo Kyung Hee,
who killed Joo Ah Ran's parents.</i>

578
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,395
Yes.

579
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:31,821
Wait till the bank is
closing before doing it.

580
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,358
Then, Shin Hyun Woo will have no way either.

581
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:36,979
That's right.

582
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,772
When is the real Ahn Jae Sung coming?

583
00:42:39,892 --> 00:42:42,031
He'll get here on the first plane tomorrow.

584
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:46,763
No matter what,
we have to get him on our side.

585
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:50,856
We have to paralyze Shin Hyun
Woo with the crime of identity theft.

586
00:43:08,756 --> 00:43:10,036
Do it slowly.

587
00:43:10,156 --> 00:43:12,849
If you do it so diligently,
I'm going to get fired.

588
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,781
If I stop I'll think of other things.

589
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:19,044
I'll prepare it, and clean the rooms,
you just rest.

590
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:21,004
I'm really comfortable,

591
00:43:21,124 --> 00:43:24,761
but why would you come to Nun Island?

592
00:43:25,464 --> 00:43:28,107
No, I just came to clear my head.

593
00:43:28,227 --> 00:43:33,137
The view here is good, so is that air,
I really made the right choice.

594
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:37,230
All the unhappy things,
seem to have ended up on the beach.

595
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:42,260
There is no hate, no dissent,

596
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,031
and there's no need to fight,

597
00:43:45,851 --> 00:43:47,535
it's comfortable here.

598
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:55,123
<i>Ahjusshi,</i>

599
00:43:55,243 --> 00:43:58,101
<i>you have to be strong.</i>

600
00:43:58,676 --> 00:44:03,728
<i>I'll miss Ahjusshi, but I'll hold it in.</i>

601
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:09,075
<i>But, I'm worried,
that Ahjusshi will be tired.</i>

602
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:22,891
President, the last invoice just came in.

603
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:25,640
There's not much time to settle it.

604
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,775
Don't say anything to my father.

605
00:44:29,895 --> 00:44:33,590
But tomorrow's papers,
will definitely publish that we're bankrupt.

606
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,818
Hurry and do it.

607
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:40,363
Just follow this and publish it.

608
00:44:44,422 --> 00:44:45,573
No... what?

609
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:50,390
Don't tell any of the stockholders,
just you, Secretary Kang, and I will know

610
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:52,304
Go gather the legal personnel immediately.

611
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,073
I understand, President.

612
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:02,684
Thank you, Nam Joo Seung,
for giving me courage.

613
00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:08,887
I don't know why I've
lived so diligently until now,

614
00:45:09,902 --> 00:45:12,587
running around so tirelessly to earn money,

615
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:16,975
I thought everything would
be good as long as I had money.

616
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:22,091
But now, I would return that money,
hundred-fold, thousand-fold,

617
00:45:24,499 --> 00:45:27,038
as long as I can get my
two legs back to walk.

618
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:31,301
<i>I really deserved it.</i>

619
00:45:32,644 --> 00:45:35,884
Not being able to go to school, and being
unknowledgeable was always a regret of mine.

620
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:39,718
So I only knew how to hit
and torture my family members.

621
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:43,150
Now, I'm getting punished.

622
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:46,624
Don't say things like that.

623
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,260
<i>Think about it.</i>

624
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,907
The crimes I committed
aren't just one or two.

625
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,592
When Ah Ran's parents died,

626
00:45:55,712 --> 00:46:01,479
I was greedy for that compensation,
so I made a fake check.

627
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,560
I forced them to sign a fake agreement,

628
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,629
I've done a lot of things
against my conscience.

629
00:46:08,439 --> 00:46:14,783
<i>Importing inadequate material, turning them
into high end furniture and then selling them,</i>

630
00:46:14,903 --> 00:46:19,144
making double account
books and evading taxes,

631
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:22,885
my life is really interesting.

632
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:29,594
At first I could die, but I'm alive.

633
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,429
In the future,

634
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,468
I should do everything I haven't done.

635
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,474
<i>Honey,</i>

636
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,494
<i>I'm the worst mother in this world.</i>

637
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:47,376
<i>It was me that killed the
parents of the sons' greatest love,</i>

638
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,126
<i>and turned them into enemies.</i>

639
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,205
I called you because there was something up.

640
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:19,196
After I get discharged, I want to
officially accept you into my family as a son.

641
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:20,922
But,

642
00:47:21,924 --> 00:47:24,418
you have to break up with Joo Ah Ran.

643
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,507
I can't do that.

644
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:28,745
You have to do so.

645
00:47:29,653 --> 00:47:31,613
Although I knew my best friend, your father,

646
00:47:31,733 --> 00:47:34,576
and my wife betrayed me at the same time,

647
00:47:36,352 --> 00:47:39,862
I never asked why Secretary
Nam did that till the day he died.

648
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:43,267
Because, I took you as my own child.

649
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:50,333
You know I'm Madam's son?

650
00:47:51,755 --> 00:47:53,631
I'm not an idiot,

651
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:56,103
how could I not know?

652
00:47:56,572 --> 00:48:01,810
But I didn't treat you differently
from Hyun Woo and Hyun Min.

653
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:06,819
Because, among my sons, you're most like me.

654
00:48:06,939 --> 00:48:08,785
What's the use of saying this now?

655
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:16,118
If you knew everything from the beginning,
why didn't you say so?

656
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:21,532
Then Madam wouldn't have
to hide anything either.

657
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,283
I'm regretful that I didn't
work up the courage earlier too.

658
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:32,106
This is the title deed that was placed
in your name not long ago.

659
00:48:32,894 --> 00:48:35,196
No matter how difficult
the company's situation was,

660
00:48:35,316 --> 00:48:40,620
I never wanted to touch it, not once.

661
00:48:41,025 --> 00:48:43,817
You settle what is yours.

662
00:48:44,371 --> 00:48:46,886
It's cold. Let's go in.

663
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:10,086
President, dropped this.

664
00:49:12,886 --> 00:49:13,845
Then.

665
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:40,182
<i>Since you made it to medical school,
you can be a doctor.</i>

666
00:49:40,302 --> 00:49:41,988
<i>Good job, good job!</i>

667
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:45,846
<i>Once you graduate,
I'll build you a big hospital.</i>

668
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,983
Jae Hee, where are you?

669
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:11,395
What can I do for you?

670
00:50:13,086 --> 00:50:16,027
I really really miss you,

671
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,542
and I'm so guilty I'm going crazy.

672
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:33,325
You don't care if the company goes bankrupt,

673
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:36,035
and you only care about your love life?

674
00:50:36,653 --> 00:50:38,230
Jae Hee left,

675
00:50:39,189 --> 00:50:41,982
and she even emptied her house.

676
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,028
What?

677
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:47,795
Where did she go?
When?!

678
00:50:49,202 --> 00:50:50,907
I don't know either.

679
00:50:51,568 --> 00:50:53,699
No matter as Yoon Jae Hee or Joo Kyeong Ran,

680
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,729
she's had a tiring life.

681
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:58,522
This is all because of you!

682
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,998
I looked so hard for her, what is
going to happen if I never find her again?!

683
00:51:03,118 --> 00:51:05,334
It's not enough to snatch my parents away,

684
00:51:05,454 --> 00:51:08,190
now you want to steal my sister too?!

685
00:51:08,552 --> 00:51:12,325
This never ending battle,
when is it ever going to finish?

686
00:51:13,668 --> 00:51:15,735
Are you asking because you don't know?

687
00:51:16,882 --> 00:51:19,888
Till either you or me,

688
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:23,213
when either one of us
has absolutely nothing.

689
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:53,409
<i>Soul Furniture,
announces bankruptcy for the first time.</i>

690
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:09,740
Director, it's Jae Hee.

691
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,556
Is it true that Soul Furniture is bankrupt?

692
00:52:13,676 --> 00:52:15,303
They are bankrupt.

693
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:18,250
But what is scarier, is that Teacher
Shin stole someone else's identity,

694
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:20,147
and is being investigated for fraud.

695
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:24,005
The Jae Sung from England
is coming back today, Jae Hee.

696
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:25,667
Jae Sung,

697
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,515
Ahn Jae Sung Oppa?!

698
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:32,844
This is the title deed that
your father gave to Joo Seung.

699
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:35,359
Sell it and use it to
pay off the debts first.

700
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:38,107
If we can't stop it today,
we'll become bankrupt.

701
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:40,899
No.

702
00:52:41,475 --> 00:52:45,589
This is the share that
Dad left to Joo Seung.

703
00:52:45,908 --> 00:52:48,644
I don't wish to keep Soul
using underhand methods.

704
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:52,992
Today, I'll handle all of
the stocks under my name in Soul.

705
00:52:53,397 --> 00:52:56,765
What does that mean?
Won't you lose ownership then?

706
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:59,559
Compared to ownership, it's more
important to save the company first.

707
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:08,429
What?

708
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:11,179
Jae Hee contacted you?!

709
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:15,100
Now, you're going to pick up
Ahn Jae Sung from the airport, right?

710
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,014
I'll take him to the station
to get his statement done immediately.

711
00:53:17,134 --> 00:53:19,047
It'll make everything
easier and better for us.

712
00:53:19,167 --> 00:53:23,856
He's also from the orphanage, keeping him away
from Jae Hee, might be beneficial to us.

713
00:53:25,529 --> 00:53:28,024
I'll wait for you in front
of the police station.

714
00:53:29,047 --> 00:53:33,310
But, the police station is too quiet,
it makes me nervous.

715
00:53:34,354 --> 00:53:37,167
We sent the invoice back, but there's been no
movement for Shin Hyun Woo, I think it's strange.

716
00:53:37,495 --> 00:53:41,800
Shin Hyun Woo isn't doing
anything, like a cripple.

717
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:45,424
He's been stabbed in the back
by the person he loves the most.

718
00:53:45,544 --> 00:53:47,779
Let's go, we're going to be late.

719
00:54:00,333 --> 00:54:03,296
Ahjusshi, has the boat to Nun Island left?

720
00:54:03,416 --> 00:54:05,364
It just left.

721
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,300
Ahjusshi.

722
00:54:24,941 --> 00:54:26,540
Jae Hee.

723
00:54:39,535 --> 00:54:42,156
Ahjusshi, how can you be here right now?

724
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:44,607
What can we do about the bankruptcy?

725
00:54:44,727 --> 00:54:48,742
Why are you not handling the company matters,
what am I that you are coming to look for me?

726
00:54:48,862 --> 00:54:51,300
Without Jae Hee, I can't do anything.

727
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,974
Everything I do, I think
about Jae Hee all the time.

728
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:58,024
I'm worried I won't be able
to see you for the rest of my life.

729
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:01,519
We don't have time to do this right now.

730
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:03,608
Today, Ahn Jae Sung Oppa
is coming back from England.

731
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:05,496
<i>The real Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

732
00:55:05,616 --> 00:55:10,313
Joo Ah Ran wants to convict Ahjusshi for fraud,
that's why they called Oppa.

733
00:55:10,433 --> 00:55:11,720
Let's go.

734
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:19,151
Yeon Jae, you know how to knit?

735
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,559
I told you everything that
requires my head I can't do,

736
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,479
but everything to do with my hands, I do.

737
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:28,360
I'm knitting a carpet to put on Father's
knees when he's sitting on the wheelchair.

738
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,792
To make Father a little happier,
should I add a little pattern?

739
00:55:31,912 --> 00:55:33,412
Thank you.

740
00:55:33,763 --> 00:55:36,659
How could you have such adorable ideas?

741
00:55:36,779 --> 00:55:40,411
If you have wishes, you have to act
in order for them to come true.

742
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:45,718
Suddenly, such an awful person appears
and demands his son, would he give him up?

743
00:55:46,477 --> 00:55:48,694
Am I that good?

744
00:55:48,814 --> 00:55:50,388
Besides having the fortune
of having wealthy parents

745
00:55:50,508 --> 00:55:52,690
and letting Yeon Jae live
a little more comfortably,

746
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:54,819
I don't have any other good points.

747
00:55:55,117 --> 00:55:58,464
Even during the college exams, I couldn't
get into a college, that's why I went to America.

748
00:55:58,584 --> 00:56:00,190
What is this, what is this,

749
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:03,366
I knew you had a slow brain,
but I didn't think you had stones for brains.

750
00:56:03,486 --> 00:56:06,492
It's totally destroyed, totally destroyed.

751
00:56:07,686 --> 00:56:11,970
When we get married and have children, they'll
definitely be the first in the entire country.

752
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,441
You think that's easy?

753
00:56:13,561 --> 00:56:15,539
It won't be easy having
a child that's the best.

754
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:26,344
Yeon Jae, let's, get married at Christmas.

755
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:28,553
<i>That was originally the date
Hyung was supposed to get married,</i>

756
00:56:28,673 --> 00:56:31,196
since it's reserved already,
let's just do it.

757
00:56:32,262 --> 00:56:36,716
I want Yeon Jae to enter the family earlier,
so our family can be happier.

758
00:56:37,411 --> 00:56:39,265
Christmas?

759
00:56:40,821 --> 00:56:43,103
Ahn Jae Sung, when you were in England,

760
00:56:43,223 --> 00:56:46,428
did you know your identity had been stolen?

761
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:50,712
Right, do you know the Shin Hyun Woo here?

762
00:56:51,053 --> 00:56:53,248
Shin Hyun Woo,

763
00:56:54,864 --> 00:56:58,083
is our company's Korean representative.

764
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,514
No.

765
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,221
He's lying.

766
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:07,177
I'm the representative of the
English company, ROBBINS.

767
00:57:07,297 --> 00:57:12,314
Not long ago, when we picked a Korean
representative, we picked Shin Hyun Woo.

768
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:18,802
That can't be.

769
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:24,123
ROBBINS is an imaginary company
that Shin Hyun Woo used for revenge.

770
00:57:24,997 --> 00:57:27,085
Did you talk to Yoon Jae Hee before this?

771
00:57:27,205 --> 00:57:30,587
Nam Joo Seung, please sit down.

772
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:32,697
I thought this could be of use,

773
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:36,320
so I brought the legal
documents for ROBBINS.

774
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:37,727
These,

775
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:42,102
are all the documents that show that contracts
in Korea that have been handed to Shin Hyun Woo.

776
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,940
After I've looked through the documents
and completed my investigation,

777
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,562
we'll listen to both sides.

778
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:05,865
What happened?

779
00:58:06,164 --> 00:58:09,382
Did the real Ahn Jae Sung say everything?

780
00:58:09,502 --> 00:58:14,174
The fact that his real name has been stolen,
he wouldn't remain unmoved, right?

781
00:58:17,328 --> 00:58:19,652
You seem curious, so I'll tell you.

782
00:58:19,772 --> 00:58:24,055
Ahn Jae Sung is the legal
representative for ROBBINS in England.

783
00:58:24,175 --> 00:58:27,657
Hyun Woo, is the Korean
legal representative.

784
00:58:27,777 --> 00:58:29,601
That can't be.

785
00:58:30,326 --> 00:58:32,542
How can this lie be even plausible?

786
00:58:32,662 --> 00:58:37,168
From the beginning, did you plan to pretend
to be Ahn Jae Sung and snatch Soul away?

787
00:58:37,738 --> 00:58:39,677
You're smarter than I thought.

788
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:44,175
But everything that Hyung did was a fraud.

789
00:58:44,295 --> 00:58:45,837
I'll find out.

790
00:58:45,957 --> 00:58:47,095
A fraud?

791
00:58:47,564 --> 00:58:50,005
Getting back what's mine is a fraud?

792
00:58:50,265 --> 00:58:52,158
If you are so confident, do it.

793
00:58:52,968 --> 00:58:54,460
You tell the banks,

794
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,868
no matter what, you have to
stop Soul from bankruptcy.

795
00:58:56,988 --> 00:58:58,407
I beg you.

796
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,618
Shin Hyun Woo's asking you to do this?

797
00:59:03,738 --> 00:59:05,739
Even though you say it's for our parents,

798
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:07,975
there's no reason to hate Hyun Woo.

799
00:59:08,095 --> 00:59:10,618
What has that person done to you?

800
00:59:10,738 --> 00:59:16,693
He loved you so innocently,
and was thrown into death by you.

801
00:59:17,076 --> 00:59:20,540
But, why do you still torture him this way.

802
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:24,014
I want to take revenge for Joo Seung.

803
00:59:24,824 --> 00:59:29,446
The life that Joo Seung had, having the same son,
yet being abandoned by his parents,

804
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,025
I have to comfort him too.

805
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,158
Do you know?

806
00:59:35,278 --> 00:59:38,557
I've called the police to this coffee shop.

807
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,668
I told the police that I'm with the criminal
that set fire to Yang Pyeong.

808
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,375
Now, the police are rushing over.

809
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:48,022
Are you crazy?

810
00:59:48,142 --> 00:59:50,643
Are you going to hand your
sister over to the police in the end?

811
00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:54,158
I gave you every opportunity
to repent, but you refused.

812
00:59:54,278 --> 00:59:55,650
What are you going to do?

813
00:59:55,770 --> 01:00:00,446
Are you going to block the invoice, or are you
going to be investigated by the police?

814
01:00:04,591 --> 01:00:06,168
Get up, follow me.

815
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:09,152
Let go of me, let go of me!

816
01:00:41,232 --> 01:00:43,556
Now it's time you let go of Yoon Jae Hee,

817
01:00:43,676 --> 01:00:46,433
and return to being Joo Kyeong Ran.

818
01:00:47,056 --> 01:00:51,447
Then, I'll forget everything
that you did to me as Yoon Jae Hee.

819
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:53,749
No, I don't want to.

820
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:56,562
Do you not understand why
I returned you the red shoes?

821
01:00:56,682 --> 01:01:00,061
That's because I don't
want to live as Joo Kyeong Ran.

822
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,406
<i>Don't cling on to me.</i>

823
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:05,880
Joo Ah Ran's sister,
Joo Kyeong Ran, died 25 years ago.

824
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,253
Now, we're not sisters anymore

825
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,644
Even if we hear of anyone's death,
let's not look for each other.

826
01:01:14,603 --> 01:01:16,798
How could you...

827
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:24,040
Let's die together.

828
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,088
Living like that, we might as well die.

829
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:28,687
Let go of me!

830
01:01:28,807 --> 01:01:32,076
Why should I die with you?
If you want to die, go die by yourself.

831
01:01:32,196 --> 01:01:35,188
I promised Mom I'd take care of you.

832
01:01:35,308 --> 01:01:36,999
So if we die, we die together.

833
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,671
No! I'm not dying!

834
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:40,121
Let go of me!

835
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,021
Look clearly!

836
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:49,307
Here, is the river where
Mom and Dad's ashes were scattered.

837
01:01:54,054 --> 01:01:56,420
You don't remember,

838
01:01:57,657 --> 01:02:00,598
but we sent Mom and Dad away here.

839
01:02:04,942 --> 01:02:08,587
The day that accident
happened was my birthday.

840
01:02:10,354 --> 01:02:16,791
The day I was born,
became my nightmare.

841
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,296
When we were young,

842
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,472
watching your parents die,
do you know what that means?

843
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:32,239
Not even paying your last respects

844
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:35,318
and the feeling of losing your parents,
do you know what that feels like?!

845
01:02:38,365 --> 01:02:43,416
Everyone in the world said I was cheap,
a burden, and pointed fingers at me.

846
01:02:45,078 --> 01:02:47,401
<i>I thought you could at least understand me.</i>

847
01:02:50,130 --> 01:02:54,648
I thought you could comfort me for
all the pain that I suffered all this time.

848
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:58,740
That's why I hung on till now.

849
01:03:04,091 --> 01:03:07,352
Pouring drinks for other people,
and jumping on tables to dance,

850
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:11,040
it wasn't tiring once I thought of you.

851
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:19,467
I thought everything would be worth it,
as long as you understood me and comforted me.

852
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:27,525
I really didn't imagine, that we would be
doing this in front of Mom and Dad's ashes!

853
01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:47,163
Now, do as you wish.

854
01:03:49,073 --> 01:03:51,184
Turn me over to the police,

855
01:03:52,715 --> 01:03:55,297
kill me for Shin Hyun Woo,

856
01:03:56,262 --> 01:03:58,159
do as you wish.

857
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,678
<i>Being able to see you,</i>

858
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:05,790
was enough.

859
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,850
I thought you died of
hunger a long time ago.

860
01:04:13,534 --> 01:04:16,475
Knowing that you're still on this earth,

861
01:04:18,139 --> 01:04:20,463
is enough.

862
01:04:38,495 --> 01:04:39,667
Unnie.

863
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,973
The people I miss,

864
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:48,534
aren't Mom or Dad.

865
01:04:49,797 --> 01:04:55,552
It's the Unnie, that put
on the red shoes for me.

866
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,562
<i>Unnie's warm hands,</i>

867
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,230
<i>I've been missing that for 25 years.</i>

868
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,981
But how can I forgive Unnie?

869
01:05:10,044 --> 01:05:11,750
If I help Unnie,

870
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:16,034
Unnie will become a coward
that runs away for her entire life.

871
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:23,611
It's not too late now,
hurry and turn yourself in.

872
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:29,174
Then, the rest of my life,
I'll live for you Unnie.

873
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:31,634
I promise.

874
01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:34,810
I don't care even if I
turn into an accomplice.

875
01:05:35,798 --> 01:05:38,042
I'll stay by Unnie's side,

876
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:41,716
and repent for you till the day I die.

877
01:05:48,269 --> 01:05:50,336
I'm heading to the hospital right now.

878
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:53,794
Shin Hyun Woo bribed
Ahn Jae Sung to hit me hard,

879
01:05:53,914 --> 01:05:56,778
and I can't let things be as well.

880
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,083
<i>That's right.</i>

881
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:04,712
<i>In the end, everything will come to light.</i>

882
01:06:04,832 --> 01:06:07,653
<i>Rather than running away like a coward,</i>

883
01:06:08,207 --> 01:06:11,490
<i>I should just turn myself
in with my head held high.</i>

884
01:06:13,051 --> 01:06:18,550
<i>Shin Woo Sub has lost so much,
it's time I let him go.</i>

885
01:06:29,338 --> 01:06:31,086
I'm afraid you didn't see today's papers,

886
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:32,536
I brought them for you.

887
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:34,326
What are you doing,
you can't.

888
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:37,941
Soul Furniture, announcing
bankruptcy for the first time.

889
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:42,055
What is going on, didn't you
say the invoices were settled?

890
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:45,248
I did it.

891
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:52,900
Ah Ran bought the last invoice,
it was in my hands, and I turned it in.

892
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,992
In the end, you chose to
become enemies with us, is that it?

893
01:06:56,112 --> 01:07:00,042
Will you only be comfortable if
you stab a knife into your mother's heart?

894
01:07:00,703 --> 01:07:02,024
<i>You settle this.</i>

895
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,369
After we eventually end up bankrupt,

896
01:07:04,489 --> 01:07:07,269
it's not possible for me
to even think about forgiving you.

897
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:10,728
The mastermind of this entire thing,
was President's family.

898
01:07:10,848 --> 01:07:14,001
You have no right,
to talk about forgiveness.

899
01:07:15,408 --> 01:07:17,582
President, you don't know, right?

900
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:21,786
The person who killed
Ah Ran's parents, is Madam.

901
01:07:21,906 --> 01:07:23,896
What... What are you saying?

902
01:07:24,016 --> 01:07:26,118
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

903
01:07:26,238 --> 01:07:30,232
You didn't know that Madam
did something to the tires, did you?

904
01:07:30,765 --> 01:07:32,880
The person that killed Ah Ran's parents,

905
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,629
<i>plunging the two sisters into tragedy,</i>

906
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:37,249
was Madam!

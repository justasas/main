00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,951
Temptation Of An Angel

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:06,150
Episode 13

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,368
I'm asking you who Rosemary is,
why aren't you answering me?

4
00:00:12,654 --> 00:00:14,726
Who's Rosemary?

5
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,652
It's my first time hearing such a name.

6
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:19,744
You saw President Hwang's wife?

7
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:22,706
You're still making excuses
saying you don't know?

8
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:28,266
Everyone knows about your past,
only we don't know.

9
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:33,480
Every night you're in men's arms
pouring wine and joking.

10
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:38,291
You're hiding such a dirty past and
you want to marry Hyun Woo.

11
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:40,776
This shameless, scary

12
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:44,476
Husband, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:48,476
What's Rosemary?
Who's pouring wine?

14
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,424
So it's like this...

15
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:53,572
you're a drinker and you act
like a classy American

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,173
lying to my kind brother
and marrying him?

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,689
This is a great rotten story.

18
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,562
<i>So it's really like this?</i>

19
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,383
So sister-in-law is such a scary person?

20
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,764
<i>There's no need to say anything more...</i>

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,394
I won't accept her as my daughter in law.

22
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,560
Money earned by pouring wine

23
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:14,440
and given to us to buy furniture.

24
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:19,612
Hurry up and burn these furniture.
Instantly!

25
00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:32,101
Episode 13

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,133
Husband, husband, calm down,

27
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:39,597
husband, husband Please don't get angry,
I'll clean it. calm down.

28
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,426
Is this a situation to calm down?

29
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:44,746
We've been using blankets bought
with dirty money to sleep

30
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:48,754
Wearing suits, this is so unlucky,
how can I take it?

31
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,659
Since you already know,
I don't need to argue

32
00:01:54,887 --> 00:02:00,778
I'm a poor orphan, I left home in
high school to a nightclub.

33
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:04,002
Because living needs money...

34
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:08,077
With a 40 degree fever I still go to
the nightclub dancing and pouring wine.

35
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,655
Not everyone without parents
live like you!

36
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:13,949
You think money is dirty?

37
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:18,081
To make the treasury full, father fired
workers and lied to agencies

38
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:20,633
Getting these money is a clean thing?

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,831
The one stealing money is father, not me.

40
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,569
<i>Impolite...</i>

41
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,046
being thief and trying
to blame someone else.

42
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,926
A tricked marriage,
and begging strongly isn't enough...

43
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:42,794
who do you dare teach a lesson to?

44
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,471
Ah Ran, what kind of attitude
do you have in front of a elder

45
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:48,227
Hurry up and get out, hurry.

46
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:52,825
Father, you've mistaken...

47
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,988
You will definitely apologize for the smack.

48
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:02,077
Because my furniture seems
embarrassing today...

49
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:07,739
Tomorrow, you will thank
me for the furniture

50
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:10,191
For now, good night.

51
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:14,198
This... this...

52
00:03:29,998 --> 00:03:34,070
The celebrity and the president
isn't your dad's friend..

53
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,293
they're the nightclub customers right?

54
00:03:37,981 --> 00:03:39,798
Even my brother doesn't know..

55
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:44,614
If my brother helped sister-in-law lie,
then it's a lie.

56
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:49,275
I met Hyun Woo when I was in the nightclub

57
00:03:49,452 --> 00:03:52,479
don't dirty his pure love.

58
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,372
I'm tired, please go out

59
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,390
Okay, you better watch out...

60
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:05,420
let's see when you'll still be so strong.
I'll watch carefully.

61
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:12,471
This is even better...

62
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:17,738
I don't need to act nice anymore.

63
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:23,414
From now on, it will officially start.

64
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:29,383
Even if you people unite holding a knife,
I won't be scared at all.

65
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:36,824
It's here, it's time to let everyone
slowly know my existence.

66
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:41,220
Slowly show everyone
that I'm still alive.

67
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,946
Then, if Joo Ah Ran finds out first,
what do we do?

68
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:51,626
Joo Ah Ran will think that it's
Nam Joo Seung's plan of threatening.

69
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:56,748
As a result, Joo Ah Ran and Nam Joo Seung's
war will be even more thrilling.

70
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,525
The war will start now.

71
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:13,116
<i>Hyun Woo hyung is definitely still alive</i>

72
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:16,781
<i>Hiding behind Ahn Jae Sung's
face tricking me</i>

73
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:21,572
<i>Need to find evidence. If I don't attack first,
then I'll get controlled</i>

74
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:25,602
<i>Shin Hyun Woo, 180cm tall
Blood type A</i>

75
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:28,339
No facial surgery, appendix surgery...

76
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,440
allergic to peanut, seasonal skin infection.

77
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:45,436
There's no good news to read.

78
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:51,993
<i>What's this?</i>

79
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:57,582
Star Electronics and Soul Furniture
sign investment, big business is born.

80
00:05:57,768 --> 00:06:03,573
What is this? I'm the leader
and I don't know about investing.

81
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,944
Dad, isn't this sister-in-law
and President Hwang?

82
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:15,802
It is, what's sister-in-law planning now?

83
00:06:15,986 --> 00:06:19,982
If it's not a trick, what would
a big business invest in?

84
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:24,015
This is scary, hurry up and
bring that thing down!

85
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,635
Yesterday, Star Electronics
and President Hwang...

86
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:31,735
decided to give our Soul a major investment.

87
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:36,717
Now it's the nation's biggest furniture business.
How do you feel?

88
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:42,446
Who told you to worry about this?
I won't give you the company's business.

89
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:45,769
You know Soul's condition
and you're still saying this?

90
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:49,625
SM Furniture emerged online
and Soul's sale decreased.

91
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,383
There's no help for it.

92
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:55,586
If this continues on, I won't guarantee
that we won't go bankrupt.

93
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:59,532
Bankrupt? Who was the one that
helped the company get to this place?

94
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:04,376
Ever since you got control, Soul started
to get unstable, everyone knows.

95
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,063
Hello? I'm Shin Woo Sub.

96
00:07:09,973 --> 00:07:14,393
Yes, President Park.
Investment?

97
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:20,594
<i>It's not worth celebrating,
but thank you.</i>

98
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:32,198
<i>Let me go.</i>

99
00:07:33,709 --> 00:07:39,551
Not afraid of death, you dare trick me?

100
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,320
President made the decision..

101
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,949
If President appoint the nightclub couple
stole the business secret.

102
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,108
The impact on the community would be big.
Those few cents were that disappointing?

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,176
Listen carefully...

104
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:58,681
the water has already spilled.
For the sake of the company's image, I won't correspond

105
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:02,680
But our company's money,
even $10 won't go out.

106
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,387
I don't know about the company's investment,
I don't have anything to say.

107
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,051
Come!

108
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:16,586
<i>I can't, no</i>

109
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,047
Don't think this world so easily...

110
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,993
Considering the past,
this time I'll let you off.

111
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,804
What is this?

112
00:08:38,032 --> 00:08:40,963
Joo Seung Oppa delivered it.

113
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,323
Joo Seung Hyung? Let me see.

114
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:53,550
NNJ? This is...

115
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:58,768
Right, it's the couple ring from in the car
the day of Hyun Woo's incident

116
00:08:58,942 --> 00:09:01,426
You held onto the ring last time right?
Hurry and bring it.

117
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:03,015
Okay

118
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:13,095
This one

119
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:20,463
Yes, the same initials.
the same heart shaped ring.

120
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:21,626
The ring's owner is...

121
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,705
It's Hyun Woo Oppa and sister-in-law.

122
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:28,774
NNJ, is Nam Joo Seung and
Joo Ah Ran's initials.

123
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,734
I'm like a fool, how can I find out now?

124
00:09:33,664 --> 00:09:36,715
But, if this ring was young
in Hyung's car...

125
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:40,082
then it's evidence that
Hyung knew their relationship.

126
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:46,185
Then, that day in the car,
would it be sister-in-law?

127
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:51,110
So, this couple ring is Joo Ah Ran
and Dr. Nam's, right?

128
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:52,197
It's definitely right.

129
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:57,741
I'm sure they've seen each other
before Hyung's incident

130
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,715
If Hyung seen this couple ring,..

131
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,678
that day, he definitely had
an argument with sister-in-law.

132
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:05,042
This is how everything happened.

133
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:07,721
How can there be such a thing?

134
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:09,645
Maybe it's not true, not true.

135
00:10:09,864 --> 00:10:11,426
Sister-in-law is Sister-in-law,
but it's Joo Seung that I can't forgive.

136
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:13,764
I can't forgive Joo Seung Hyung

137
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,631
Hyung Woo Hyung loves him like a brother.

138
00:10:16,774 --> 00:10:18,810
How can he backstab him?

139
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:22,832
I think Secretary Nam isn't
like that either.

140
00:10:23,054 --> 00:10:26,877
If Uncle Nam finds out,
he'll be so angry.

141
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:31,287
He has always been following our dad
like a shadow, being awful to our family.

142
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:37,375
Before this is clear, keep this
as a secret to your Dad. Please.

143
00:10:40,636 --> 00:10:42,454
Did you see today's newspaper?

144
00:10:42,613 --> 00:10:47,308
Star Electronics will invest into
Soul Furniture

145
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:53,983
So, can you help me one last time?

146
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:59,781
Increasing the factory so suddenly
needs a lot of money

147
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:04,427
After Star Electronics' money comes,
I'll return it immediately.

148
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:06,515
I'm so sorry,

149
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:11,978
I bought a few buildings in Sony
and used up all my money

150
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,213
Anyhow, Leader Zhu, I'm so sorry.

151
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,532
Receiving such a big investment
from a big company

152
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,529
Compared to my brother's news,
it's has much more ability

153
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,351
Brother?

154
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:30,360
I guess my little brother knows
a bit about you.

155
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:36,287
I heard from my brother, that's why
I invested such a big amount.

156
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:41,123
For not being able to help,
I'm sorry, See you later.

157
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,925
What do I do?

158
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,682
Star Electronics’ investment is gone.

159
00:11:56,807 --> 00:11:59,040
How can I get money?

160
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:01,906
It might be the end.

161
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,920
Right, only one person can help me.

162
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,201
President Joo, what happened?

163
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,113
I just missed you, so I came.

164
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:52,582
I didn't think I'd be so lucky
to hear to sing

165
00:14:52,716 --> 00:14:57,314
The atmosphere is so unique,
what song is it?

166
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,192
A story of a man who feel
in love with a prostitute.

167
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,584
I really like this song.

168
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,558
Once I sing this song, I'll want to
start dating without myself knowing

169
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:11,791
Feel in love with a prostitute

170
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:16,984
President An can have this kind of love?

171
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:23,575
Of course. If the woman won't hide
her past and her occupation...

172
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:29,288
love cannot start from lies.

173
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,051
What's wrong with the company?
You don't look so good.

174
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:48,524
A woman doing business is so difficult.

175
00:15:49,228 --> 00:15:54,890
There's no one with discuss with,
no one with help me.

176
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:04,799
What ring is this?

177
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,190
I wear it with my girlfriend

178
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:09,641
I personally don't like these things

179
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:12,500
But my girlfriend begged me,
so I wore it.

180
00:16:12,783 --> 00:16:17,789
Girlfriend? You're not talking about
Yoon Jae Hee are you?

181
00:16:17,904 --> 00:16:23,759
This. My girlfriend probably not
willing so I can't tell.

182
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:27,467
If you're leaving later,
I'm going to leave now

183
00:16:44,919 --> 00:16:47,895
Why do you want to see me?

184
00:16:49,603 --> 00:16:53,085
President An gave you this ring, right?

185
00:16:53,494 --> 00:16:55,653
I think I told you last time.

186
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,635
Please don't interfere with
my personal life.

187
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,286
If you called me because of this.

188
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,250
I'll go in first.

189
00:17:03,121 --> 00:17:04,935
You arrogant woman.

190
00:17:05,268 --> 00:17:07,223
Acting like you don't know in front of me.

191
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:09,873
Behind me you're hooking up with men.

192
00:17:10,118 --> 00:17:11,915
You like President Ahn's wealth?

193
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:14,753
So you're dazzling in front of him?

194
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:16,590
However innocent you act,

195
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:19,844
you think President An doesn't
know what you're up to?

196
00:17:20,087 --> 00:17:23,432
Since President An already knows,
I don't need to be worried

197
00:17:23,698 --> 00:17:26,009
If you trust President An,
then you can relax

198
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:28,459
President An has good insight.

199
00:17:28,691 --> 00:17:32,306
You think he'll randomly like any woman?

200
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:45,563
Miss, if you're like this,
does the hospital head know?

201
00:17:45,992 --> 00:17:47,861
What?

202
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,116
Hurry up and take off that ring.

203
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:55,247
I can't share with you a man that I like.

204
00:17:55,406 --> 00:17:59,771
Being jealous of a woman like you
hurts my pride

205
00:17:59,992 --> 00:18:02,589
Now that I look, Miss is a very weird person

206
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,097
Lying down Shin Hyun Woo patient,
worrying about the head of the hospital

207
00:18:06,234 --> 00:18:09,276
Now you're liking Leader An
behind the hospital head?

208
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,612
Why aren't you focused on one man?

209
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,868
You shouldn't be like this
for a dead person

210
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,984
Don't worry about my business

211
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:27,989
If mention Shin Hyun Woo to me again,
I won't let you go.

212
00:18:30,096 --> 00:18:36,945
Okay, from now on I'll only mention
Shin Hyun Woo in "Pyong Chang Dong"

213
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:44,978
I'll end the reasoning with you today.

214
00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:53,340
You dare look down on me.

215
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:02,330
What? Commercial?

216
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:08,418
Yes, we received a notice rushing us.

217
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,767
What's going on? He told us awhile ago he
was handling the mortgage.

218
00:19:15,983 --> 00:19:18,099
It's been so long and it's
still not resolved

219
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,490
Do you use your mouth to do business?

220
00:19:20,654 --> 00:19:22,390
Because of Star Electronics' investment,

221
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:25,076
not needing to quickly return
all the money is a lucky thing.

222
00:19:25,191 --> 00:19:27,841
If we're supervised by this,
then there's a problem.

223
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:33,787
I want to kick out the rules,
because only Star Electronics can endure it.

224
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,623
Why's there a phone call?

225
00:19:39,899 --> 00:19:43,162
It's not even time for our room
to be cleaned.

226
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,436
Hello?

227
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:50,330
I'm Kim Mi Yoo, who are you?

228
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:55,001
You found who took Jing Ran?

229
00:19:55,173 --> 00:20:00,345
We looked through the documents and
found contact to the person who took Jing Ran.

230
00:20:00,477 --> 00:20:05,752
That's what I said. If you look carefully,
there's definitely a record.

231
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:08,716
Give me a pencil, pencil, yes.

232
00:20:09,081 --> 00:20:14,878
I'll ask you next time, I'll hang up

233
00:20:15,926 --> 00:20:17,659
Did you hear?

234
00:20:17,753 --> 00:20:20,592
They found our Jing Ran

235
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:25,178
Wait. When we talk like this and switched
telephone numbers, it's too wrong.

236
00:20:25,303 --> 00:20:27,309
Let's call first.

237
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,863
<i>We can really earn money</i>

238
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,830
Hello?

239
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,920
25 years ago in the Pyul Gang orphanage,

240
00:20:44,921 --> 00:20:47,221
you adopted a little girl?

241
00:20:47,662 --> 00:20:50,120
Can I ask, who are you?

242
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:56,328
I'm the girl's aunt, I found someone
to get information...

243
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:59,949
They said you randomly took my niece.

244
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:05,351
How can you take away a baby
you're temporarily taking care of?

245
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:07,224
Where is my niece now?

246
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:12,037
What are you calling? It seems like
you have the wrong number.

247
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:18,015
Stop talking trash,
just tell me where my niece is!?

248
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:24,499
This person, you think I can't find
your house with this phone number?

249
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:26,524
Sorry...

250
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:33,593
Please give me some time
because I didn't raise the child.

251
00:21:33,744 --> 00:21:36,047
The condition now is unclear.

252
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,872
Give it to me.

253
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:44,553
Hello...

254
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm a person who can't live long.

255
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:55,191
The doctor said surviving until
tomorrow is difficult...

256
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:59,035
Before I die, can't I see me niece?

257
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:01,427
She's always shining in front of me

258
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:14,390
Hello, Hospital Head,
I'm Shin Hyun Woo's mom.

259
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:17,433
I have an urgent situation
to discuss with you.

260
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:23,116
The child I adopted her uncle and aunt
are looking for her.

261
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:26,435
So it's like this? I heard she had a sister,

262
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,828
I didn't know she had an uncle.

263
00:22:28,984 --> 00:22:31,428
If you promised, of course you have to go.

264
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,750
After I contact her, I'll let her go.

265
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:39,388
What? My uncle is looking for me?

266
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:42,251
Of course I have to see him.

267
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:46,575
If I see my uncle, I get might
some news about my sister

268
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,659
Where is it, Hospital head?

269
00:22:53,068 --> 00:22:55,416
You don't have any meetings tonight?

270
00:22:55,613 --> 00:22:57,429
I know a place with delicious pasta.

271
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,400
Want to try it together?

272
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,549
Okay, let's go with my car together.

273
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:06,342
Wait in the car,
I'm going to make a call inside.

274
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:08,120
Okay.

275
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,032
Please say it.

276
00:23:31,205 --> 00:23:35,564
Hurry and go to Sam Sang Dong's
entrance, it's urgent.

277
00:23:36,286 --> 00:23:39,258
I have an important meeting
right now, I can't go.

278
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:41,196
You have to come out

279
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:44,022
It's Nurse Yoon's lover.

280
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,862
If you don't come out, you'll regret it.

281
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:52,903
It's helpful to fix Nurse Yoon's feelings.
I'll wait for you.

282
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:54,753
Excuse me.

283
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,183
What's the matter.

284
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:05,087
Did something happen to uncle?

285
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:20,932
An Jae Seung, it's your turn
to show your real heart.

286
00:24:21,274 --> 00:24:24,842
Today I'll let you end.

287
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:28,409
Putting two woman on top of a scale.

288
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:55,867
What happened, are you okay?

289
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:58,132
I'm fine.

290
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:03,965
What? Let me go, President An, save me

291
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:05,900
What are you doing to a woman.

292
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,488
Who sent you here?

293
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:11,524
Go away. I only listen to people
who give me money.

294
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,008
If you don't want to die, leave

295
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,219
You little

296
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:19,559
President An, save me.

297
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:23,844
It's the people sent by Father.
President An

298
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,039
President An!

299
00:25:27,903 --> 00:25:32,437
Stop the car. Before I call the police,
stop the car.

300
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,046
Jae Hee, why are you here?

301
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,908
Why is it like this? What would I do
if something happened?

302
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:00,625
There's no need to help Joo Ah Ran and die.

303
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:04,548
Sorry, there's no time to talk.
I'll call you.

304
00:26:04,719 --> 00:26:07,893
Ahjussi, ahjussi

305
00:26:18,502 --> 00:26:22,222
Please give me a little time. A little.

306
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:32,325
Ahjussi, don't go.

307
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:35,258
It's dangerous

308
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:40,440
What's Joo Ah Ran for this?

309
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:48,906
He's following right?

310
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,500
Yes.

311
00:26:53,284 --> 00:26:58,629
Yoon Jae Hee, now you're awake?

312
00:26:59,158 --> 00:27:05,686
Even if you're stupider you'll know
where An Jae Seung's heart is

313
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:39,084
That little Jin Ran, how come
I can't see her anywhere

314
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,914
We've waited for an hour already..

315
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:48,505
Could it be, that the person who adopted
Jing Ran is in the middle playing tricks?

316
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,170
She also wants some profit.

317
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:56,621
It can't be that she knows we want the
furniture store and want to split it in half can it?

318
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,515
Who give?

319
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:03,326
Looks like we need to scare her.

320
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:05,940
Then she'll bring Jing Ran out.

321
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:08,221
Wait

322
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:20,016
Hello? I'm the person who
just called, Jing Ran's Aunt

323
00:28:20,187 --> 00:28:23,960
What's the reason behind
why we still can't see Jing Ran?

324
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:29,227
<i>You want to get sued with kidnap?</i>

325
00:28:29,487 --> 00:28:32,505
What's an adult doing bringing
a child to business

326
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,330
Before we go to your house and corrupt,
hurry up and bring Jing Ran out.

327
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,851
Do you understand?

328
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:58,131
What are you doing?
Why'd you unplug the telephone line?

329
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:02,495
You came? There's always weird
telephone calls coming, so

330
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,209
Weird phone calls?
What's that?

331
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,474
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

332
00:29:08,628 --> 00:29:12,716
Switch the telephone number
tomorrow and it'll be fine.

333
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:21,557
We used the telephone for almost 30 years,
why do we have to change?

334
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:28,248
What is it? Weird telephone
calls calling home.

335
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:38,617
Excuse me.
Did a 50 year old man come by?

336
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:44,456
Oh, that one.
He left about an hour ago.

337
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:09,701
<i>An Jae Seung, My luck is worn by you.</i>

338
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:15,826
<i>The danger behind getting
you isn't anything.</i>

339
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:43,557
President An, are you okay?
You're really hurt.

340
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,721
Father sent some men to take Soul
away from me. I'm scared.

341
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:51,611
But you shouldn't have jumped out of the car

342
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,863
So your own life is nothing?

343
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,246
I'm not afraid of death..

344
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:59,007
when I knew you were chasing behind.

345
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,974
All my fear faded away.

346
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:05,362
So risking my life jumping out.

347
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:08,800
If I still alive...

348
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:14,809
the first thing I'd do is confess to you.

349
00:31:16,192 --> 00:31:21,940
I.. like you.

350
00:31:27,938 --> 00:31:31,583
Until now, I thought a lot of men liked me..

351
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,098
But...

352
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:38,677
the one man I tried to get,
you were the first.

353
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:56,192
<i>An Jae Seung, you're finally trapped by me</i>

354
00:31:56,726 --> 00:32:02,128
<i>You were so worried about me,
now you're like a warm sheep</i>

355
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:09,418
<i>Joo Ah Ran, you only have this move?</i>

356
00:32:09,631 --> 00:32:13,385
<i>You think this plan would work?</i>

357
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:20,464
<i>Trick me all you can.
But it'll be your end.</i>

358
00:32:53,455 --> 00:32:58,138
Unni, how are you?

359
00:32:58,805 --> 00:33:04,730
Today, uncle contacted me.
Although we didn't see each other...

360
00:33:05,258 --> 00:33:09,169
the fact that I have a family
makes me happy.

361
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:14,729
Does uncle know Unni's news?

362
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:19,569
Unni, you're looking for me too right?

363
00:33:21,115 --> 00:33:22,827
I miss you...

364
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:27,177
I miss you, Unni.

365
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,175
Even if the company closes,
we still need to let sister-in-law out.

366
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:35,255
Why don't we let go of
Star Electronics investment?

367
00:33:35,366 --> 00:33:40,013
That can't do.
This isn't a childish act

368
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,539
This involved thousands of lives.
How can we just close down?

369
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:46,691
Let's accept the investment.
Saving the company is important.

370
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,610
I need to look at the investment book.
Let your sister-in-law come back

371
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:57,565
She shut her phone.
She's definitely with Joo Seung Oppa

372
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:03,465
That scary thing.
So unlucky.

373
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:10,447
Sorry for coming so late.
I have something to say.

374
00:34:10,572 --> 00:34:12,858
I'll go in for a bit.

375
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,575
My house is messy, sit here first.

376
00:34:24,946 --> 00:34:30,709
It's okay. Our daughter-in-law
didn't come here?

377
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:35,782
No. Is it to make sure?

378
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:40,326
Last warning, Don't see Ah Ran

379
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,773
Why?

380
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:45,728
Because she's Shin Woo's ex-lover.

381
00:34:46,134 --> 00:34:50,744
Whatever is unhappy, I will block

382
00:34:51,268 --> 00:34:56,797
Really? So full of love towards your son.

383
00:34:56,917 --> 00:35:00,720
Block it. I have confident in taking Ah Ran

384
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,994
I'm curious in who will win

385
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:08,681
What? You're doing tricks
to a leader's wife?

386
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,604
Taking away Hyun Woo's wife.
Will Doctor Nam be happy?

387
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,413
Of course...

388
00:35:14,864 --> 00:35:18,165
I'll be happy.
Miss's unhappiness is my happiness

389
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:21,317
What are you saying?
How can you say that?

390
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:27,186
I thought we could communicate.
Looks like I was wrong.

391
00:35:27,348 --> 00:35:33,151
<i>A child abandoned by his mom.
How good can she get?</i>

392
00:35:34,543 --> 00:35:37,983
<i>Even the mother who gave birth
to him won't acknowledge him</i>

393
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:42,117
<i>There isn't much hope, right?</i>

394
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:53,126
In the future it'll be even worse.
Miss, what do you think?

395
00:35:53,873 --> 00:35:59,326
Look for President Shin and tell him
an interesting story he doesn't know

396
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:06,101
I don't want to ruin that family.
So I've been holding it in.

397
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:09,693
I suddenly feel really angry.

398
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:11,807
What are you talking about?

399
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,195
Miss doesn't know.

400
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:17,680
Only a story only my dead father
and I would know

401
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:22,924
Miss doesn't not know, she forgot.
Did I say something wrong?

402
00:36:23,001 --> 00:36:28,407
I don't understand what
Doctor Nam is saying.

403
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:32,469
I have to go back.

404
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:49,743
<i>It can't be he knows everything</i>

405
00:36:50,061 --> 00:36:53,535
<i>It can't be. Impossible.</i>

406
00:37:02,018 --> 00:37:05,756
Did I tell President Ahn about this?

407
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,944
Actually...

408
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:14,257
not long ago a man
who liked me passed away.

409
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:21,617
The man's sister wanted to take revenge
on me and opened SM Furniture.

410
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,148
What?

411
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,702
That woman wants me and Soul Furniture dead

412
00:37:31,393 --> 00:37:34,146
Help me, please.

413
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:38,190
I definitely cannot give up on Soul

414
00:37:39,473 --> 00:37:44,790
Why so you miss Soul so much?
Is it your dead husband's company?

415
00:37:46,189 --> 00:37:52,156
Soul has my lonely dead family's soul in it.

416
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:59,793
Giving up on Soul would be like
giving up on my life.

417
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:03,122
Then how can I help you

418
00:38:03,712 --> 00:38:08,739
You continue to take control of Soul

419
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:12,752
You have the ability and the wealth

420
00:38:12,954 --> 00:38:18,918
In return,
I'll be yours forever.

421
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:25,702
You seem to know well
how to seduce a man.

422
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:29,730
Okay, I'll think about it...

423
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:35,889
But, what's the real reason behind
President Shin pushing away daughter-in-law?

424
00:38:38,223 --> 00:38:41,022
In the end, it was still because of me...

425
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,487
they're afraid that I'll take away Soul.

426
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:47,062
They still didn't report their son's death.

427
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,660
Lost his parents since birth..

428
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:56,375
None of my in-laws can help me,
and I can't fight my father as is.

429
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,027
I didn't know President Joo has
this kind of pain.

430
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:16,514
Can I sleep here tonight?

431
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:20,804
I don't have anywhere to go.

432
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:31,183
If Leader An won't take me.
I'll only die.

433
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:36,731
I can't let such a pretty person
walk around on the street.

434
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:41,575
Just sleep here tonight.

435
00:39:56,307 --> 00:40:02,028
Lending a blanket to a woman,
you're the first. Good Night.

436
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,086
The pain will hurt a lot.

437
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:15,139
Why don't you treat me as a woman

438
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:24,378
I've already been ready to accept you.

439
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:34,748
A real man will care like a jewel.

440
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:44,896
Good night, I'll sleep on the sofa.

441
00:41:13,063 --> 00:41:18,942
Ahjussi, why do I seem like a fool?

442
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,668
To take revenge on Joo An Ran...

443
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:26,380
you're sleeping with her. This I know.

444
00:41:29,212 --> 00:41:31,446
We've already reasoned...

445
00:41:34,113 --> 00:41:36,365
But I feel like I'm going crazy.

446
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:40,591
Really...

447
00:41:43,746 --> 00:41:45,799
There's only this way?

448
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:20,164
Hello?

449
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,823
<i>Did sister-in-law sleep there?</i>

450
00:42:22,084 --> 00:42:25,619
If you want to leave the house,
let her clean first.

451
00:42:25,808 --> 00:42:30,650
Sleeping everywhere like that, it's so dirty
it makes people feel uncomfortable.

452
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:34,955
What? Didn't she come home?

453
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,147
<i>You really know how to act.</i>

454
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:42,974
But I won't get tricked.
This world has no secrets.

455
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:49,120
What you two did to my brother,
will eventually be revealed to everyone.

456
00:42:57,847 --> 00:42:59,633
Thank you.

457
00:43:27,878 --> 00:43:29,618
Is it Doctor Nam?

458
00:43:29,944 --> 00:43:34,113
Pick up. Hiding won't solve anything.

459
00:43:34,498 --> 00:43:39,612
Tell him you were at my house.
Let him understand.

460
00:43:42,683 --> 00:43:43,405
It's me..

461
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:44,997
Listen carefully...

462
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,459
Listen to me first. Last night
I was at Leader Ahn’s house...

463
00:43:48,549 --> 00:43:52,701
Listen to me, don't say anything

464
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:58,574
Leader Shin's prescription you
changed I already know

465
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:02,741
Only you used an excuse to fire a guard.

466
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:05,786
You can't even think of an excuse

467
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:08,951
The CCTV evidence has been confirmed.

468
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,488
What?

469
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:17,570
There person who used Miss' phone
to send a message was you too.

470
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,042
It's been confirmed with the
communication company.

471
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:24,748
What should you do? Bring these
evidence to find Leader Shin..

472
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:25,993
Or...

473
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:31,408
tell Hyun Woo about how the
mansion got on fire.

474
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:32,709
Tell these to him.

475
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:33,706
Or...

476
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:39,630
Tell him the truth about Ji Jun
being your father.

477
00:44:41,028 --> 00:44:46,932
How is it? Like your wish,
if President faints, that isn't bad.

478
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,703
No way. What are you talking about?
Where you are you? I'm coming.

479
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:52,928
No...

480
00:44:53,626 --> 00:44:55,030
There's no need.

481
00:44:56,603 --> 00:44:58,510
I'm going to Pyong Chang Dong.

482
00:45:04,984 --> 00:45:07,762
President An, I'll get off here.

483
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:10,156
I have something urgent.

484
00:45:56,488 --> 00:45:58,323
Joo Seung.

485
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,391
Joo Seung.

486
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:37,417
This is Joo Seung's dad.
Why's he with mom?

487
00:46:41,846 --> 00:46:44,679
<i>My dad and mom who abandoned me</i>

488
00:46:47,964 --> 00:46:50,330
How can this be?

489
00:46:51,675 --> 00:46:57,484
Then mom is Joo Seung's mom

490
00:47:00,305 --> 00:47:02,089
<i>What do you know about my parents?</i>

491
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:04,019
<i>If you're going to play tricks
on dead people, leave.</i>

492
00:47:04,116 --> 00:47:06,556
<i>I'm here to help you</i>

493
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,026
<i>Who killed your parents...</i>

494
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,527
<i>only I know in this world.</i>

495
00:47:13,672 --> 00:47:17,191
<i>It's shattered. Not one is left.</i>

496
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:20,392
<i>All is shattered and dead.</i>

497
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:23,948
<i>Your wish is my wish.</i>

498
00:47:29,645 --> 00:47:34,695
Nam Joo Seung, so it's like this.

499
00:47:35,788 --> 00:47:38,701
You're using me to take revenge
on the mother...

500
00:47:39,962 --> 00:47:42,091
who abandoned you.

501
00:47:44,473 --> 00:47:48,197
You didn't help me because you loved me

502
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:50,649
You're using my parent's death...

503
00:47:52,124 --> 00:47:54,169
to break my family?

504
00:47:57,475 --> 00:48:02,877
I still didn't know it was like this?

505
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,477
Hyung, why'd you come?

506
00:48:12,429 --> 00:48:16,784
Open the door. It has something to do
with the comment with President.

507
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:19,185
Just a little while.

508
00:48:27,336 --> 00:48:30,178
I'm busy now. Call you later.

509
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:36,325
Joo Seung. I was wrong.
i don't know what to do.

510
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:40,739
I won't see President An anymore.
I promise.

511
00:48:40,973 --> 00:48:44,521
So please forgive me.
We'll start over

512
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:46,749
Stop lying.

513
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:51,755
I can never trust woman like you anymore.

514
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:57,306
You tell the truth. then I go to jail.
What do you get from it?

515
00:48:57,723 --> 00:49:00,773
Then you'll lose everything

516
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:05,724
Something that's not good for us both,
why do you do it?

517
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:08,609
Let's go on a trip today.

518
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:14,607
Do you still remember the seaside
apartment we were in together?

519
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:18,336
I'll arrange my company things,
then I'll go...

520
00:49:18,516 --> 00:49:21,943
I trust that you'll be coming.

521
00:49:52,085 --> 00:49:54,757
Nam Joo Seung...

522
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:59,696
The crime of you lying to me
this whole time.

523
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:04,161
I'll return it to you today.

524
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:12,427
President An

525
00:50:12,854 --> 00:50:17,162
If you're not busy today,
take a walk with me today?

526
00:50:18,714 --> 00:50:23,590
To thank you for yesterday,
I booked a seaside apartment.

527
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:28,950
It has a new view, you might
like the vacation villages.

528
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:34,186
Then we're set.
I'll get ready.

529
00:50:39,857 --> 00:50:41,891
Mom...

530
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:50,904
What happened yesterday?

531
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:54,170
No matter what we say,
you're still our daughter-in-law.

532
00:50:54,361 --> 00:50:58,485
But you won't come home at night.
I can't endure it anymore.

533
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:01,339
Sorry.

534
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:08,281
The family seems exhausted looking at me,
so I'm avoiding them.

535
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:15,421
There's no place to go,
so I slept on the company's sofa.

536
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:24,367
This ring, do you still remember?

537
00:51:24,716 --> 00:51:28,773
We found this ring in Hyun Woo's car
on the day of the incident

538
00:51:29,246 --> 00:51:32,217
Of course I remember..

539
00:51:34,129 --> 00:51:36,910
It's Hyun Woo
and another woman's ring right?

540
00:51:36,956 --> 00:51:41,425
No. This ring isn't Hyun Woo's

541
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:47,922
Yesterday, Doctor Nam sent
the same ring to our house

542
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:53,332
This ring and you and Doctor Nam's
couple ring right? Right?

543
00:51:53,474 --> 00:51:54,401
How can this be?

544
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:59,193
Hyun Woo already knows about you
cheating on Doctor Nam right?

545
00:51:59,368 --> 00:52:02,558
So you two argued. So the incident
happened in the rain right?

546
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:05,143
Sitting in Hyun Woo's car is you, Ah Ran.

547
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:09,760
No. Did mom see it that day?

548
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:12,729
I was clearly at home.

549
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:17,585
Doctor Nam wants to frame me,
so he's planning something

550
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:23,529
Lies. I'm Hyun Woo's mom

551
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,512
If you and Doctor Nam has anything
to do with Hyun Woo's death

552
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:30,495
I won't let you go,

553
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:33,513
Even if we search again,

554
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:36,500
We'll still search what happened
that day...

555
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,900
You watch.

556
00:52:41,461 --> 00:52:44,261
To forget about your son.

557
00:52:45,617 --> 00:52:49,714
You killed the son you acted
you didn't know for 30 years?

558
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,472
What are you talking about?

559
00:52:57,649 --> 00:53:00,314
Mom, you watch.

560
00:53:01,187 --> 00:53:02,949
For the dead Hyun Woo...

561
00:53:03,758 --> 00:53:07,250
what will you do about your living
son who went to jail?

562
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,532
That's it.

563
00:53:12,047 --> 00:53:13,550
Have a good day.

564
00:53:19,718 --> 00:53:23,160
What exactly do you know?

565
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:27,960
Ah Ran can't be.

566
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:07,631
Joo Seung, what should I do?
Mom fainted.

567
00:54:07,952 --> 00:54:10,377
She's in the emergency room now.
Her condition isn't too good.

568
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,774
Looks like I can't come to the
resort today. Sorry.

569
00:54:20,392 --> 00:54:21,714
Ah Ran...

570
00:54:22,678 --> 00:54:25,642
Pick up.
Hurry and Pick up!

571
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,993
Just wait...

572
00:54:40,436 --> 00:54:43,895
Wait till I get there.

573
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:50,575
Without my approval,
you have to chance of dying.

574
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:19,741
Let's look at the sea next time.
Let's go inside.

575
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:23,179
The view inside is also really good.

576
00:55:23,639 --> 00:55:25,420
Then, okay.

577
00:55:27,218 --> 00:55:29,516
It's really a good room.

578
00:55:29,731 --> 00:55:34,600
The view is perfect,
and the interior is quite magnificent.

579
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:39,665
I didn't think that because of this trip,
Ah Ran would spend so much effort.

580
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:44,606
Really, from now on
I'll call you Ah Ran. Can I?

581
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:46,918
Of course.

582
00:55:48,733 --> 00:55:53,544
From now on,
I'll also call you Jae Chung.

583
00:55:59,905 --> 00:56:03,284
<i>Jae Chung, come here.</i>

584
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:12,568
<i>The sea is so wide.</i>

585
00:56:13,568 --> 00:56:16,182
<i>Looking at the never ending ocean...</i>

586
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:20,139
drinking bittersweet wine,
dying is also a happy ending

587
00:56:28,428 --> 00:56:32,677
<i>Ocean, woman, flower, wine.</i>

588
00:56:33,005 --> 00:56:35,704
It's really a perfect happy ending.

589
00:56:38,485 --> 00:56:41,916
The happy ending is still missing something.

590
00:56:42,575 --> 00:56:44,788
What is it?

591
00:57:28,023 --> 00:57:31,644
<i>Ah Ran, wait. I'm still not drunk
from the wine and ocean.</i>

592
00:57:31,797 --> 00:57:32,947
<i>Isn't this too fast?</i>

593
00:57:33,046 --> 00:57:37,928
<i>I've been waiting like this. Do you know
how long I've waited for today?</i>

594
00:57:38,142 --> 00:57:42,924
<i>I never thought I'd be so thrilled
and shaking with a man.</i>

595
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:45,873
<i>It's the first time I actually
feel like a woman.</i>

596
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,085
<i>If it's like this...</i>

597
00:57:47,086 --> 00:57:51,655
<i>I want to get ready
to welcome you. Take a shower first.</i>

598
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:58,058
Joo Ah Ran, until the end
you're still treating me like a fool.

599
01:00:06,092 --> 01:00:09,324
Jae Chung, what are you doing?

600
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:12,392
Joo Seung.

601
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:17,169
To be with that person...

602
01:00:18,854 --> 01:00:21,066
you said Miss was extremely ill?

603
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:25,447
When I spent a whole day
arranging this room...

604
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:27,948
you were playing with that person?

605
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:35,048
I came to start over.
But you betrayed me!

606
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:42,512
You have the right to talk like that?
The one who betrayed me first was you.

607
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:43,527
You still won't shut up?

608
01:00:43,627 --> 01:00:45,787
Why won't you say it?

609
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:48,315
that my mother-in-law...

610
01:00:50,075 --> 01:00:52,180
is your real mom.

611
01:00:56,073 --> 01:01:00,767
You were mother-in-law’s outside son.
Why'd you keep it to yourself?

612
01:01:01,747 --> 01:01:04,201
You're angry that mom abandoned you...

613
01:01:04,552 --> 01:01:06,602
so you want to ruin this family?

614
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:12,376
So you pulled me into your revenge.

615
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:21,809
No, Ah Ran, it's not.

616
01:01:26,171 --> 01:01:29,515
You don't love me.

617
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,993
It's only for your personal revenge...

618
01:01:34,851 --> 01:01:36,670
you used me.

619
01:01:38,359 --> 01:01:41,166
Did I say anything wrong?

620
01:01:41,967 --> 01:01:47,656
It was like this from the start.
But now it's not.

621
01:01:48,815 --> 01:01:51,851
We really love each other.

622
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:57,650
Our trust has shattered.

623
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:02,067
I can't trust you...

624
01:02:03,347 --> 01:02:05,650
you also can't trust me.

625
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:09,707
<i>Also, we're not anything.</i>

626
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,851
Don't hold on to my heart...

627
01:02:18,453 --> 01:02:20,460
my heart is flowing.

628
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:26,527
My heart is already not here.

629
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:56,326
Ah Ran!

630
01:02:57,878 --> 01:02:59,393
Ah Ran!

631
01:03:31,703 --> 01:03:34,687
It can't end like this.

632
01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:37,729
If I didn't love you...

633
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:42,182
when Shin Woo died, revenge
would have already ended.

634
01:03:42,564 --> 01:03:45,675
I stayed because of you.

635
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:51,118
Return everything back
to its original space,

636
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:55,631
first I need to reveal An Jae Seung's mask.

637
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:31,328
I secretly researched on
SM's Leader Chung's background.

638
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:36,148
Really? What did you find out?

639
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:39,198
In America, she's a rich,
big business woman.

640
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:43,924
Not long ago, because of her husband's death,
she received a lot of fortune.

641
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:50,707
With that much wealth, she just needs
to try then she can swallow up our Soul.

642
01:04:51,155 --> 01:04:52,795
What should we do?

643
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:58,034
How about I arrange a meeting.
I'll go with you.

644
01:04:58,299 --> 01:05:04,137
Really, could you do that for me? If you want me to
apologize to your brother I will gladly do it.

645
01:05:04,217 --> 01:05:08,688
If the value of designing is less,
I can fill it in.

646
01:05:08,982 --> 01:05:13,977
If you want to fill it up,
you need a lot of money.

647
01:05:14,268 --> 01:05:16,540
We need to get it no matter what.

648
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,739
Right. SM Furniture's President Chang.

649
01:05:21,032 --> 01:05:25,854
I heard that compared to Korean's name,
American's name is more well known.

650
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,912
What's America's name?

651
01:05:28,076 --> 01:05:29,604
Julie Chang.

652
01:05:29,889 --> 01:05:33,141
What? Julie Chang?

653
01:05:35,634 --> 01:05:40,261
No way, Julie Chang is actually
Chang Shang Mo's sister.

654
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:48,765
Then Soul's money is all
in Julie Chang's hands.

655
01:05:49,170 --> 01:05:54,277
What can I do?
I'm collapsing.

656
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:57,809
Soul being stolen is a time problem.

657
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:01,560
At the end I still need to be poor?

658
01:06:29,413 --> 01:06:31,346
Plastic Surgery Department

659
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:46,973
The man who just left,
was that his prescription?

660
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,801
I'm sorry, that's a little difficult

661
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:53,821
I'm his relative, he seems to be
keeping an illness away from us.

662
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:58,324
It's for the patient,
please help me out.

663
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:10,032
He's taking so many pain relievers
and antibiotics.

664
01:07:11,438 --> 01:07:12,860
What's the matter?

665
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:18,545
Please confirm the deposit book.

666
01:07:19,554 --> 01:07:20,316
Thank you.

667
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,445
Thank you.

668
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:32,454
I'm sorry, the person who just left,
said that he left his bankbook here.

669
01:07:32,657 --> 01:07:39,548
Oh, I'm sure I gave it back to him. Ah,
you must be talking about Shin Hyun Woo?

670
01:07:40,984 --> 01:07:43,252
Shin Hyun Woo?

671
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:49,977
Shin Hyun Woo!

679
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:21,238
<i>You think I can't recognize you
after you change your voice?</i>

680
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:22,939
<i>I know how to check who Hyung is.</i>

681
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,367
<i>Follow 24 hours, don't let anything leak</i>

682
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:28,413
<i>What doesn't seem like Shin Hyun Woo,
is An Jae Seung is Shin Hyun Woo's evidence</i>

683
01:08:28,527 --> 01:08:31,005
<i>My name is Shin Hyun Woo!</i>

684
01:08:31,117 --> 01:08:33,935
<i>Please wait, shortly I'll return
with my original name.</i>

685
01:08:34,095 --> 01:08:37,379
<i>Unni, don't forget about me!</i>

686
01:08:37,554 --> 01:08:39,466
<i>The one who brought Ah Ran is mom?</i>

687
01:08:39,601 --> 01:08:42,197

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,995
Temptation Of An Angel 

3
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:06,984
Episode 17

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:16,485
Hello?

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,015
Mother.

6
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,296
Hello? Who...?

7
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:26,015
Mother, it's Hyun Woo.

8
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:33,518
Hyun Woo? Is it really you, Hyun Woo?

9
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:39,218
Yes, Mother. It's Hyun Woo.

10
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:41,300
Are you really Hyun Woo?

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,304
My son, Hyun Woo?

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,452
Yes.

13
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:47,001
Where are you right now?

14
00:00:47,121 --> 00:00:49,231
Tell me where you are,
I'll go pick you up right now.

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:51,684
Why didn't you come back if
you were still alive?

16
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:56,152
Just wait for a while. Then,
we'll be able to meet.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,733
I'll call again.

18
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:04,779
Hyun Woo? Hyun Woo!

19
00:01:08,006 --> 00:01:10,154
There's no mistake, it's my son Hyun Woo.

20
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,158
My son Hyun Woo is still alive!

21
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:26,996
It's me.

22
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:29,478
Attorney Lee just came by.

23
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:31,716
The Yang Pyeong villa under Joo Ah Ran

24
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,967
was transferred to Nam Joo Seung,
did you know?

25
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,340
What? To Nam Joo Seung?

26
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,626
All of the other assets were
transferred to you,

27
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:45,215
but the Yang Pyeong villa was transferred
to Nam Joo Seung. I'm surprised.

28
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:49,356
Is it some kind of settlement for a man that she has
taken advantage of, then thrown away?

29
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,996
That's not possible. No matter what reason,

30
00:01:52,116 --> 00:01:54,167
Nam Joo Seung has no right to the
Yang Pyeong villa.

31
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,844
Although it all burned up...

32
00:01:56,964 --> 00:01:59,750
it has evidence to prove two
people's evil actions.

33
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:04,512
No matter what, I will get it back.

34
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,885
Nam Joo Seung.

35
00:02:11,689 --> 00:02:15,073
Do you also want to hurt my parents? [? He says something like his parents being stabbed in the heart]

36
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,887
What is betrayal?

37
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,458
I will let you feel what it means
to be betrayed.

38
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:36,761
<i>Last year in October, the beautiful medical
director Nam Joo Seung,</i>

39
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:39,244
<i>placed car accident patient Shin Hyun Woo</i>

40
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:42,637
<i>in the Yang Pyeong villa
without any medical attention</i>

41
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:45,682
<i>The patient's guardians were led to believe in a 
medical treatment which was in fact non-existent.</i>

42
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:49,560
<i>Not only that, it has been proven that he hired a
foreigner that didn't have a medical license,</i>

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,847
<i>and directed him to provide
the medical care.</i>

44
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:57,530
<i>For such unmoral behavior, Nam Joo Seung's
license should be taken away.</i>

45
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,520
We're finally leaving tomorrow.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,617
Are you going to drive a knife into
my parents' hearts too?

47
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:09,619
It's not uncomfortable. Don't worry.

48
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:15,270
Here are some information
about Design School.

49
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,625
After you get to America,

50
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,348
study furniture design more formally.

51
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:21,344
Like your dream,
you get a degree, find a job

52
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:23,562
and become a real furniture designer.

53
00:03:23,682 --> 00:03:25,285
I will help you.

54
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:29,394
Me... study design?

55
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:31,259
It's not something that's impossible.

56
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:35,207
Every day, after getting up,
pack a lunch box and go to the library.

57
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:39,416
You'll learn linguistics,
then go to Design School.

58
00:03:40,062 --> 00:03:44,023
I'll get a new medical license in America,
then go into neurology.

59
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:48,803
Like that. Then you'll give birth to a baby that
is half like you and half like me.

60
00:03:49,206 --> 00:03:51,348
Think about it,
isn't that such a happy image?

61
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:01,333
<i>Joo Seung, the image you have
of us together, give up on it.</i>

62
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,429
<i>Right now, my heart...</i>

63
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:06,913
<i>is filled with thoughts about Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

64
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,618
<i>I love that man.</i>

65
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,789
<i>If it's because of that person...</i>

66
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:14,200
<i>I can even forget revenge.</i>

67
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,865
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

68
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,379
I have a present to give you, too.

69
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:26,264
The Yang Pyeong villa that had my all,

70
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,092
was transferred to you today.

71
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:33,210
You are also your mother's son.

72
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,748
You have the right to accept these.

73
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,264
A villa in Korea is useless.

74
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:41,453
And, I don't need this.

75
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,983
Even so, you should accept these.
Who knows what will happen?

76
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,778
Director,
something of yours came by courier.

77
00:04:54,898 --> 00:04:56,783
The sender was Shin Hyun Woo.

78
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:59,447
What? Our Hyun Woo?

79
00:05:09,318 --> 00:05:10,918
What is this?

80
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,746
How could Joo Seung do something like this?

81
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:19,089
Secretary Kang.

82
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:19,998
Yes, President.

83
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:24,305
Go and get the records from when I was wrongly
hospitalized and a doctor's confirmation.

84
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:27,729
I was going to protect him to the end...

85
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,949
but now I can't put up with him anymore.

86
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,885
Why did you come to the hospital?

87
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,089
If you needed help,
you should have called me.

88
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,058
I only came because I have good news.

89
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,776
I heard your sister was looking for you.

90
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:51,728
My sister? Is this true?

91
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,418
I knew you would be happy,
I came when I got the news.

92
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:57,479
I'll try to set up a meeting for tomorrow,
so go and meet her.

93
00:05:58,267 --> 00:06:03,209
Sister. My sister didn't forget me?

94
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:09,838
Where was she? Why did she only come now?
I missed her so much.

95
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,796
It's still a relief that you
can meet her now.

96
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,450
Before, I didn't know...

97
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,722
but I heard you real name was Kyung Ran.

98
00:06:19,276 --> 00:06:23,854
Kyung Ran?
My original name is not Yoon Jae Hee?

99
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:26,152
Jae Hee was a name I came up for you.

100
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:30,072
Oh yeah,
you still have those red shoes, right?

101
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:34,683
Of course. It's the only thing that can
help me find my family.

102
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:37,511
When you go see your sister,
you have to bring them.

103
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,800
Your sister probably still remembers them.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,521
I know, Director. Please make it so we
meet as soon as possible.

105
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,622
I'm fine with any time.

106
00:06:46,831 --> 00:06:51,619
Kyung Ran. Kyung Ran.

107
00:07:37,392 --> 00:07:40,926
So it's like this. Shin Hyun Woo
and Yoon Jae Hee

108
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,961
have known each other since the orphanage.

109
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:48,051
So that's why Yoon Jae Hee is helping
Shin Hyun Woo with the revenge.

110
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,257
What's the matter?
Why are in a department store?

111
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:59,314
Tomorrow is the wedding, and I feel bad that I
haven't bought you anything.

112
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:02,718
Tomorrow when your parents come,
they won't dislike me, right?

113
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,925
This is not quite it.

114
00:08:27,144 --> 00:08:29,598
Jae Sung, look at this.

115
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,112
It's beautiful, isn't it?

116
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:37,671
I want to give birth to a son that looks
exactly like you. What about you?

117
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:41,924
<i>Pregnant?
I'm pregnant with Shin Hyun Woo's child?</i>

118
00:08:42,044 --> 00:08:44,756
<i>Every time I think about how I carry
Shin Hyun Woo's child,</i>

119
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:47,958
<i>I feel more disgusted than when I have
snakes crawling all over my body.</i>

120
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:55,236
Let's wait to have a child.
There isn't enough time to love you.

121
00:09:02,044 --> 00:09:05,888
If it's okay, can we go see my parents?

122
00:09:06,563 --> 00:09:08,655
After we get married,
we won't have much time to visit.

123
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,054
I want them to see their son-in-law.

124
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,207
Parents?

125
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:34,921
Mom...
Dad...

126
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:42,340
When they're in a good mood,
they would've had a drink.

127
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,916
Today, please drink as much as you want.

128
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:54,810
Dad. I'm getting married.

129
00:09:57,254 --> 00:09:59,977
I've met a good person that
I'm getting married to.

130
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:03,606
So, don't worry about me now.

131
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:09,731
We'll find Kyung Ran too.

132
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,853
Today, I will fulfill...

133
00:10:15,045 --> 00:10:17,148
the promise I made to the both of you.

134
00:10:19,862 --> 00:10:24,139
Please rest in peace now.

135
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,143
Looks like there is a heartbreaking
story behind this.

136
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,591
How did your parents pass away?

137
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:38,195
In the company that they've worked
for their whole lives...

138
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:42,309
they told the truth and wrongly died.

139
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:47,740
<i>It was made so it looked like it accident.
But it was a planned murder.</i>

140
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,294
To save Dad...

141
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,577
my mom also passed away on the same day.

142
00:10:56,711 --> 00:10:58,305
Is that the truth?

143
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,728
If both of them passed away,

144
00:11:01,988 --> 00:11:03,991
the truth is unknown.

145
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,163
How did you know?

146
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:10,679
After entering the tiger's den,
I saw it with my own eyes.

147
00:11:12,586 --> 00:11:18,447
They also took away my poor little sister.

148
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,320
Sister?

149
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,304
Although we haven't seen each
other in 25 years,

150
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,195
I haven't forgotten her for even a day.

151
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,054
Tomorrow, before leaving...

152
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:39,990
I must find and meet her.

153
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,999
What is the company your parents worked for?

154
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,601
If it's that kind of evil business,

155
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:49,830
I think it's best if I remember it.

156
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,444
It's at a place that you know.

157
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:00,538
It's at...

158
00:12:02,878 --> 00:12:04,240
Wait a second.

159
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,014
It's me. Is it ready?

160
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,930
Alright. I'm leaving now.

161
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:26,272
Sorry. Something urgent came up
and I have to go now.

162
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,820
Made it look like an accident,
but was murder...?

163
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,849
It definitely was our Hyun Woo.

164
00:12:44,219 --> 00:12:45,896
His voice changed a little,

165
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,553
but it's the same warm tone.

166
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:49,111
It's definitely Hyun Woo, no mistake.

167
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,326
Yes. It's Hyun Woo.

168
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:53,382
He sent me this today.

169
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,459
What is this?

170
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,506
Request to invalidate
Nam Joo Seung's license...?

171
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:06,727
Our Hyun Woo...

172
00:13:06,847 --> 00:13:09,419
knew all about the things Joo Seung
was doing in the Villa.

173
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,146
Although he was lying with his eyes closed,
he wasn't sleeping.

174
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,945
<i>Hyun Woo really woke up?</i>

175
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,099
But sister-in-law didn't tell us.

176
00:13:17,219 --> 00:13:18,809
<i>How can we just let it go like this?
How could she have done that?</i>

177
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:20,809
No, what is this?

178
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:23,505
Why is the Yang Pyeon villa under
Doctor Nam's name?

179
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,158
He even stole Hyun Woo's wife,
what can't he steal?

180
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,552
Look at Hyun Woo,
telling us what Joo Seung did.

181
00:13:30,672 --> 00:13:32,709
He's telling us to not forgive what
Joo Seung did.

182
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:36,906
And, the last time he messed
with my medical records.

183
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:38,747
We should use this chance to make
him take off his doctor's coat.

184
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:40,976
<i>-Honey...
-Our Hyun Woo is coming back.</i>

185
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:44,020
If it's like this, will he forgive his
wife and Joo Seung?

186
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,261
This family and the company will come
back to the original place,

187
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:48,158
so I'm not worried about anything.

188
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,676
Director. Something big happened.
We must go back to the company and see.

189
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:54,753
Why, what is it?

190
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,668
The shareholders came to the company...

191
00:13:56,788 --> 00:13:58,565
and are requesting for you to be
dismissed from your position.

192
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,741
What?

193
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:11,062
<i>You went behind our backs and sold
the company. Is that true?</i>

194
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:15,613
The news about Soul collapsing
is traveling everywhere,

195
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:16,785
<i>how do you explain that?</i>

196
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:19,033
Everyone, don't be like this.

197
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,310
Director, let's get away from here.

198
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,246
<i>Your son died, but you still haven't
reported his death yet.</i>

199
00:14:24,366 --> 00:14:27,554
You unmoral jerk!

200
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,578
You must immediately transfer your
position to someone else...

201
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:33,860
<i>and save the company even if it means selling yourself!
You jerk, do you understand?</i>

202
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,828
Our SOUL didn't die!

203
00:14:36,597 --> 00:14:38,451
I will be responsible for reviving
the company.

204
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:43,686
Just you wait! My son is still alive!

205
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:48,908
I, Shin Woo Sub,
absolutely will not lose. Ever!

206
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,562
<i>You're Shin Hyun Min, right?</i>

207
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,365
Yes. What is it?

208
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,876
The leadership power has been changed.

209
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,304
If you don't move out soon...

210
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,216
we'll have to force you to.

211
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:20,076
Stop all business.
We'll have to repossess your furniture too.

212
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,527
What? Repossess?

213
00:15:22,647 --> 00:15:23,879
- Let's start.
- Yes.

214
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,214
Nam Joo Seung finalized everything
with the hospital, right?

215
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,076
Yes. He said he's going to America tomorrow.

216
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,116
It's like he hasn't even dreamed that

217
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:40,957
Joo Ah Ran is getting married.

218
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:45,731
But everything will be revealed tomorrow.

219
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:49,123
What exactly are you thinking of?

220
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,562
My heart can't rest and it's
driving me crazy.

221
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:54,293
If Joo Ah Ran find out who you are today,

222
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,121
the wedding will be ruined.

223
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:58,998
You don't know what
Director Nam is going to do.

224
00:16:01,623 --> 00:16:03,967
There hasn't been a moment
where there isn't danger.

225
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,807
Life is about choosing.

226
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,137
Once you've made your choice,
you cannot be afraid.

227
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,840
I want to stand up from where I've fallen.

228
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:18,622
If the thing that went wrong
in my life was marriage...

229
00:16:19,321 --> 00:16:23,692
I should go back,
and start anew from there, right?

230
00:16:25,147 --> 00:16:26,624
I believe in you.

231
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,920
When you were Shin Hyun Woo,
or Ahn Jae Sung...

232
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:33,683
even when you're going to be Joo Ah Ran's
husband tomorrow,

233
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:35,762
my heart will remain the same.

234
00:16:35,882 --> 00:16:38,120
It will stay here, and wait for you.

235
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,482
Do just as we planned. Do it well.

236
00:16:55,927 --> 00:17:00,074
Let them be scared. Don't hold back.

237
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,549
They will reap what they have sown.

238
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:04,261
Please don't worry.

239
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,230
This house belongs to Ahn Jae Sung, right?

240
00:17:16,947 --> 00:17:20,732
So why are you still here
and not moving out?

241
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:22,258
What are you going to do?

242
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:23,916
We never sold this house.

243
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:25,207
This is fraud!

244
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:29,730
Fraud? This house was bought with money.
How is this fraud?

245
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,718
While I'm being nice, hurry up,
pack your bags and get out.

246
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:36,942
You guys. Did this guy called Ahn Jae Sung
tell you to come here?

247
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:38,009
That jerk.

248
00:17:38,129 --> 00:17:39,193
This is our house.

249
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,213
Before I call the cops, get out.

250
00:17:41,457 --> 00:17:46,510
Cops? If the cops come,
you will be the one they usher out.

251
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,166
Come. Let's start.

252
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:53,239
Why are you being like this?

253
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,182
It's not like we can move right away.
Why are you like this?

254
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,213
Okay. I got it. I'll be right there.
Take care of your mom and sister.

255
00:18:01,592 --> 00:18:03,666
I said that I'll take care of it!

256
00:18:06,262 --> 00:18:08,478
What is this? Where's my car?

257
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:11,448
Oh that. The shareholders took it...

258
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:13,121
along with your corporate credit cards.

259
00:18:13,347 --> 00:18:15,067
What?

260
00:18:18,285 --> 00:18:20,746
They all want me to die.

261
00:18:21,816 --> 00:18:25,368
I've worn out my shoes working so hard to
line the pockets of these people,

262
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:29,653
and they are kicking me out the moment
the company hits an obstacle?

263
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:32,498
These worthless jerks.

264
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:04,747
Get out. Get out.

265
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,226
What are you doing?

266
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,389
There had been no notice,
why do we have to move out?

267
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:15,844
Who told you to force us to get out?

268
00:19:15,964 --> 00:19:17,963
Who sent you guys,

269
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,888
Ahn Jae Sung or Joo Ah Ran?

270
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,319
They were sent by me.
What are you going to do?

271
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,224
Oh right. It's you.

272
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:30,287
You want me to die, don't you?

273
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,146
You're using these ways to
get my family fortune...

274
00:19:33,266 --> 00:19:35,463
and so planned for Hyun Woo to
have an accident, right?

275
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,224
What evidence do you have?

276
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,817
Don't be too proud.

277
00:19:38,937 --> 00:19:41,037
Someday, the truth will be revealed.

278
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,928
There's no such thing as a perfect crime.

279
00:19:44,048 --> 00:19:45,911
I'm the one that should have said that.

280
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:48,677
Through the passage of time...

281
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,005
did you think that your crimes
will disappear?

282
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:54,163
Did you think that the grudge of other
people will be so easily forgotten?

283
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:57,851
No. Even if the person died...

284
00:19:57,971 --> 00:19:59,773
crime will not rot away.

285
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:02,021
Because of your actions,
a family has been stomped over.

286
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:04,318
While you've had enough to eat...

287
00:20:04,617 --> 00:20:07,218
someone else was thinking about death.

288
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,616
Law and this world is all on your side.

289
00:20:09,736 --> 00:20:11,551
I will step on that world until
it is crushed.

290
00:20:11,671 --> 00:20:15,584
What crime have I committed? Let me hear it.

291
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:17,551
Why did you turn me into a criminal?

292
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,651
Even though we were poor,
I could have grown up in my parents' love.

293
00:20:24,804 --> 00:20:27,005
Why did you turn me into
this poisonous child?

294
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,506
Because of the hurt you gave me...

295
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:32,666
my whole being is filled me poison.

296
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:33,605
Why don't you know?

297
00:20:33,725 --> 00:20:38,218
Don't say anymore. We don't have anything
else that can be lost or stolen.

298
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:42,144
What you've done is enough.
What do we still have?

299
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:45,474
<i>Why are you pleading with such a person?</i>

300
00:20:46,074 --> 00:20:49,535
Looks like you're just saying stuff
to cover up your own crime.

301
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,407
After our Hyun Woo comes back...

302
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:54,591
you're the one that'll be dragged
to the police station.

303
00:20:56,187 --> 00:21:00,753
Really? Thanks for caring about me.

304
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:05,979
I think you should worry about where your
family's going to sleep tonight.

305
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:11,374
Lock the door properly. Don't let anyone in.

306
00:21:23,267 --> 00:21:25,145
If you've lived your life right...

307
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:28,146
you should be able to find a friend
who can lend you a room.

308
00:21:47,408 --> 00:21:49,747
Dad. Dad, don't be like this.

309
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:52,413
Dad. Dad, calm down.

310
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:11,969
<i>Father.</i>

311
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:17,661
How much did you love her,
if you've served her as the Director's wife.

312
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:19,830
and then left?

313
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:23,546
<i>I won't live like you.</i>

314
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,553
If I like it, I will fight for it.

315
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:27,922
Love will always remain on my side.

316
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,833
I won't let my woman

317
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:33,861
live as someone else's woman anymore.

318
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:09,680
Yes, hello?

319
00:23:12,027 --> 00:23:13,496
The Medical Association?

320
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,584
What did you say?

321
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:34,632
What are you doing right now?

322
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:37,153
What are you doing in someone else's office?

323
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:42,569
We've received information about how
you were conducting malpractice.

324
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:47,100
We've also received information about how you
intentionally gave out false prescriptions.

325
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,461
Per request,
the Medical Association will investigate.

326
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,126
Who submitted the request?

327
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,350
Someone named Shin Hyun Woo.

328
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,303
It's a patient of yours, right?

329
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,272
Shin Hyun Woo?

330
00:24:08,174 --> 00:24:10,838
After investigation,
not only is there medical punishment,

331
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:13,702
but also law punishments. Do you understand?

332
00:24:27,864 --> 00:24:32,068
You can take them all away,
I'll never come back here.

333
00:24:33,087 --> 00:24:35,373
As long as I get to leave with Ah Ran,

334
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:37,089
the physician's license is nothing.

335
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,871
With my abilities, I can give it up.

336
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,028
<i>You've worked hard during this time.</i>

337
00:24:53,148 --> 00:24:57,647
<i>If I hurt you, please forgive me.
Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

338
00:24:59,572 --> 00:25:01,220
What are you thinking about doing?

339
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,542
Because of your stubbornness,

340
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:07,201
your whole family has to sleep on the streets.
Does that feel good?

341
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:11,123
Are you still unwilling to hand
over Kyung Ran?

342
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:14,879
<i>Alright, I'll bring Kyung Ran over tomorrow.</i>

343
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:18,399
<i>So please return the house to us.</i>

344
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,003
<i>Regarding whose daughter you are...</i>

345
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:21,869
<i>please keep it a secret from
Hyun Woo's Dad until the end.</i>

346
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,878
Then, we will discuss this after
I meet with Kyung Ran.

347
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:37,941
Tomorrow, you will be contacted
by my mother-in-law.

348
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,993
They've been scared,
so they'll have to show us Kyung Ran.

349
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,779
Really? So everything is settled now?

350
00:25:48,844 --> 00:25:51,743
But I'm busy tomorrow, so I will not be
able to make it on time tomorrow.

351
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:55,957
Please make sure you hold Kyung Ran there,
and wait for me.

352
00:25:57,447 --> 00:25:59,213
If this completes without mistake,

353
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,166
I will transfer the furniture store
over to you as promised.

354
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:08,257
Don't worry about it.
Our nickname is Jinduk dog!

355
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:11,555
Once we grab onto it,
we definitely will not let go.

356
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:17,148
Director, what brings you here?

357
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,007
You've worked hard these days,
and I haven't had time to properly thank you.

358
00:26:21,888 --> 00:26:24,560
This is a handbag, I hope you like it.

359
00:26:25,444 --> 00:26:29,897
You don't need to be like this. Thanks.

360
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:35,872
Live a good life. You were a good person.

361
00:26:51,464 --> 00:26:52,849
That...

362
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:56,874
What is it?

363
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:05,553
<i>If Yoon Jae Hee was the one Madam
supported at the Angel Orphanage,</i>

364
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:09,177
<i>then, is Yoon Jae Hee Kyung Ran?</i>

365
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,585
Why did it become like this?

366
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,646
The sister that Ah Ran's been looking for,

367
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,874
it's Yoon Jae Hee?

368
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:35,477
How did it become like this?

369
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:39,637
The sister Ah Ran wanted to see,

370
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,287
why did it have to be...?

371
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:47,423
Even if you have no appetite, eat something.

372
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,943
The situation is already like this,
did you think I'd be able to swallow food, like pigs?

373
00:27:51,225 --> 00:27:53,563
The family fortune I've put my whole life
towards with blood and sweat...

374
00:27:53,783 --> 00:27:55,843
is just going to fly away like that.

375
00:27:56,178 --> 00:27:58,220
Mom doesn't look so good.

376
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,790
She needs to go lie down somewhere.

377
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,987
How about going to my store?

378
00:28:03,262 --> 00:28:05,387
Even though it's closed at the moment,

379
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:07,328
it's still a warm place to lie down.

380
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:08,744
Let's just live there.

381
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:10,797
<i>How can we sleep at a store?</i>

382
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,297
Before getting our house back,
let's make a reservation at a hotel.

383
00:28:13,544 --> 00:28:17,840
Did you think that Shin Woo Sup
can't come up with that much money?

384
00:28:24,248 --> 00:28:27,986
President Park, I have something urgent,

385
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,531
so can you lend me some money?
I'll pay you back.

386
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:35,639
What?

387
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,670
Ownership issue?

388
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,742
Who is it that is spreading those rumors?

389
00:28:40,862 --> 00:28:42,605
If you don't want to lend me money,
then fine.

390
00:28:55,948 --> 00:28:58,140
Yoon Jae. What are you doing here?

391
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,719
Director, something big happened!

392
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,448
Just now Ah Ran came here,
and changed the lock on the store.

393
00:29:03,777 --> 00:29:07,997
She said that the store's owner is going to change,
and asked me not to come anymore.

394
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:09,558
I tried to convince her.
That inconsiderate jerk.

395
00:29:09,678 --> 00:29:13,537
What? We can't go into the store anymore?

396
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:17,140
I'm so ashamed. My whole life

397
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:19,476
I never that that there'd be a
day when I was poor.

398
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:21,734
<i>What's the use of living?</i>

399
00:29:21,854 --> 00:29:24,129
Let's just all die together. Die.

400
00:29:27,028 --> 00:29:28,964
Mom! Stay strong, mom!

401
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:31,100
This won't do. Help mom into the car.

402
00:29:36,028 --> 00:29:38,094
She wanted to find her sister so much,

403
00:29:38,869 --> 00:29:40,700
so I should tell her, right?

404
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:52,907
No. If I tell her now,

405
00:29:53,694 --> 00:29:55,971
both of them will get hurt.

406
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,265
One person is the person Hyun Woo
wants to get revenge on.

407
00:30:00,856 --> 00:30:05,023
Another person is the person helping
Hyun Woo get his revenge.

408
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:28,170
This coffee house.
Why doesn't it have any other people?

409
00:30:29,072 --> 00:30:31,278
Today, I reserved the whole store.

410
00:30:32,694 --> 00:30:35,013
Today is the last day of our single lives.

411
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,023
We should celebrate it.

412
00:30:39,924 --> 00:30:43,846
I specially told them to make it like that.
Do you like the mood?

413
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,200
Excellent.

414
00:30:47,189 --> 00:30:50,485
The you under candlelight is more beautiful.

415
00:30:53,058 --> 00:30:54,842
Can I borrow your hand for a second?

416
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:49,824
I'm shaking.

417
00:31:50,487 --> 00:31:52,252
Then lean onto me.

418
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:56,213
It'll be fine as long as you follow me.

419
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:10,962
Jae Sung,
you make so happy I could cry.

420
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:16,050
You make my hard past...

421
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:19,312
become like white snow.

422
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:25,499
I will be able to hold your hand
until the end, right?

423
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:27,557
Why are you worrying about that?

424
00:32:28,091 --> 00:32:31,950
Once you've loved once,
you will always love, isn't it like that?

425
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:41,510
The bride that's getting married
tomorrow, how can she cry?

426
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:49,480
If I've met you from the beginning,

427
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,417
would my life be different?

428
00:32:58,051 --> 00:33:03,051
Maybe I wouldn't have gotten
married with Hyun Woo.

429
00:33:11,527 --> 00:33:13,640
If that person hadn't died...

430
00:33:14,335 --> 00:33:15,998
we wouldn't have met.

431
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:18,696
That person and me,

432
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:24,658
will not be happy even if we started again.

433
00:33:26,686 --> 00:33:29,005
A marriage that is destined for failure.

434
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,461
Everyday will be filled with
hatred and pain.

435
00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:52,727
Jae Sung, it seems like the first
time I've said this...

436
00:33:55,445 --> 00:34:00,523
but I really love you.

437
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,352
To protect this love,

438
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:09,478
I'm willing to pay any price.

439
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:20,525
<i>You woman,</i>

440
00:34:21,579 --> 00:34:24,789
<i>I can't believe even a crocodile's
tears can flow so freely.</i>

441
00:34:26,537 --> 00:34:28,912
<i>Your beautiful tears...</i>

442
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:32,165
<i>I don't know what kind of thunder storm
they will become tomorrow.</i>

443
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,414
<i>I'm curious.</i>

444
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:48,198
Why is everyone sitting like
they're being punished?

445
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:51,377
The people collecting debts won't
chase you here, will they?

446
00:34:52,615 --> 00:34:54,186
What happened? I will...

447
00:34:54,306 --> 00:34:56,167
Don't be too depressed.

448
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:59,553
There are times in life that you'll fall down
and experience storms.

449
00:34:59,673 --> 00:35:02,028
How can it be possible that your whole life is
filled with sunny paths with fresh flowers?

450
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:07,514
Cheer up! If you're healthy, then you will
have a day when you will smile.

451
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,063
Sorry. I've never thought that

452
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:12,303
I would bring you trouble.

453
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:14,425
What trouble?

454
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,948
The house is too small.
I'm the one who's sorry.

455
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:20,528
Do we all have to sleep here?

456
00:35:20,648 --> 00:35:23,482
Because you're all guests,
I'll give you this side.

457
00:35:23,602 --> 00:35:25,948
That side doesn't have heat, and is colder.

458
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,981
But since there are so many people,
it probably won't be too cold.

459
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:07,644
<i>Right. I should just leave without
saying anything.</i>

460
00:36:08,354 --> 00:36:10,518
<i>While they're still missing
for each other and...</i>

461
00:36:11,036 --> 00:36:13,224
<i>when it comes time that they
heal their wounds,</i>

462
00:36:13,449 --> 00:36:15,656
<i>they should meet.
That should be fine, right?</i>

463
00:36:23,093 --> 00:36:27,320
Sister... will she recognize
what I look like?

464
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:34,195
Sister... why didn't she look for me?

465
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:37,253
She didn't want to throw me away, did she?

466
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:48,576
Sister,
I miss you so much.

467
00:36:51,398 --> 00:37:00,412
I just want to call you again.
Sister. Sister.

468
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,774
It's finally today.

469
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:28,839
Have you prepared everything?

470
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,539
Yes. The people in the family
have all moved out.

471
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:34,107
There's no need to wait.

472
00:37:35,683 --> 00:37:37,402
There's something I need your help with.

473
00:37:38,434 --> 00:37:40,603
Can you call the reporters over?

474
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:43,308
To the wedding church?

475
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:47,615
Okay. I'll try and think of something.

476
00:37:48,068 --> 00:37:49,508
Thanks.

477
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:56,460
But, when are you leaving?

478
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,958
After your wedding officially ends.

479
00:38:02,174 --> 00:38:06,105
I've only accepted help from you. To let you go like this, 
my heart doesn't feel comfortable.

480
00:38:07,435 --> 00:38:11,478
After, I'll become like a brother to you in
place of Sang Mo, is that okay?

481
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,562
It's okay.

482
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,810
During this time,
because of leaving Sang Mo alone,

483
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,059
once I remember that I have
a brother near the sea,

484
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:26,482
my heart feels uneasy.

485
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:28,307
I only want to

486
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:33,318
place him in my heart and leave.

487
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:39,102
Today, let's go to my father's grave,

488
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:41,225
and also to your parents'.

489
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:45,009
If we're leaving tomorrow,
today's the only day we have time.

490
00:38:45,301 --> 00:38:47,211
There's no time today.

491
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:53,511
To be truthful, I've set up an appointment
to see Kyung Ran.

492
00:38:55,568 --> 00:39:01,599
Kyung Ran?
You know who Kyung Ran is?

493
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:06,288
Mother already set it up.
I've got to go there in a little while.

494
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:13,029
Kyung Ran may be different than
what you'd think she'd be.

495
00:39:13,149 --> 00:39:15,142
After such a long while...

496
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:17,554
you both might be disappointed.

497
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,213
Do you have to meet?

498
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:23,203
No matter what she changed into,
and how she lives,

499
00:39:23,776 --> 00:39:25,660
none of that matters.

500
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,833
My sister can meet me while still living,

501
00:39:28,311 --> 00:39:30,366
what else can I ask for?

502
00:39:32,084 --> 00:39:33,558
I still need some things...

503
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,269
so I'll hang onto my suitcase.

504
00:39:36,216 --> 00:39:37,958
I'll leave directly from the hotel.

505
00:39:38,078 --> 00:39:39,530
Let's meet tomorrow at the airport.

506
00:40:18,568 --> 00:40:21,281
<i>Miss Yoon? Where are you right now?</i>

507
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:24,676
I'll go there right now. Wait a while.

508
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:41,109
Ahn Jae Sung, right now...

509
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:43,954
it's time to say goodbye to you.

510
00:40:51,141 --> 00:40:52,521
Today at 11...

511
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,953
Kyung Ran will be at the Seoul Coffee Shop.

512
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:59,032
Before I get there, you must make her
stay there no matter what.

513
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:02,083
Okay. I'm hanging up.

514
00:41:06,977 --> 00:41:08,312
How are you feeling?

515
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:15,747
I'm shaking so much.
You're so handsome today.

516
00:41:16,162 --> 00:41:20,106
The bride is too pretty that she doesn't
even care about the groom anymore.

517
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:23,655
Really beautiful. Even God will be jealous.

518
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,608
Thanks.

519
00:41:29,967 --> 00:41:32,006
But, where are your parents?

520
00:41:32,494 --> 00:41:35,856
They said they've just arrived at the airport,
and should be getting here soon.

521
00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:39,232
What if they're disappointed
when they see me?

522
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,988
We don't have anyone to invite,

523
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:43,796
so the church must be empty.

524
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:46,453
Because I was afraid of that,
I spent some money and got some guests.

525
00:41:47,276 --> 00:41:48,103
What?

526
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:51,042
I heard it from someone that if
you give money...

527
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:53,607
there will be fake guests who
come to the wedding.

528
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,984
So there can be fake relatives,
fake friends.

529
00:41:58,357 --> 00:42:00,700
Because I wanted to make you comfortable,
I also called some.

530
00:42:01,991 --> 00:42:05,324
There's someone playing the
bridesmaid outside. Want to see?

531
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:07,279
Hello.

532
00:42:10,952 --> 00:42:12,849
<i>Here's the money I promised.</i>

533
00:42:12,969 --> 00:42:14,950
<i>Until it ends, don't mess up
and do it properly.</i>

534
00:42:17,206 --> 00:42:19,584
The bride is really pretty.

535
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:23,481
Be close.

536
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:27,638
This way, later on, you can act
naturally at the church.

537
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:40,043
So we've met again.
You look like you have abilities.

538
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,263
What happened? Why are you here?

539
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,483
Last time you came to my wedding,

540
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:49,762
will the guests also come?

541
00:42:49,972 --> 00:42:52,214
It's a team. Of course we all come together.

542
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:58,626
You didn't say anything, did you?

543
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:00,527
If you say anything, I won't let you live.

544
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:02,443
We've been doing this for a long time.

545
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:05,907
This is the basic, so don't worry.

546
00:43:08,321 --> 00:43:10,198
Why did it turn out like this?

547
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:15,652
Why did you buy some clothes?

548
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:17,339
It's okay if I just wore mine.

549
00:43:17,968 --> 00:43:19,416
It's not that expensive...

550
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:22,695
I just called someone to deliver it this morning.
Don't blame me, okay?

551
00:43:23,295 --> 00:43:25,855
No matter who it is, sister or uncle,

552
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:28,387
if you want them to like you,
you must be nice.

553
00:43:28,741 --> 00:43:30,347
Even after I meet them...

554
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,979
you will be like a mom to me.

555
00:43:33,212 --> 00:43:34,320
Do you know my meaning?

556
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,700
Why are you saying stuff like that?

557
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,921
After, you don't need to bother me.
I'm happy!

558
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:41,944
When you came...

559
00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:44,557
you just brought a pair of shoes with you.

560
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:46,573
Now, you've found your sister,

561
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,010
and it's because of your kindness.

562
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:52,393
This is all because of you.

563
00:43:52,513 --> 00:43:53,730
I will do good.

564
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:57,353
I will hear that even if my parents
weren't alive, I grew up well.

565
00:43:57,579 --> 00:43:59,119
Don't worry.

566
00:44:04,585 --> 00:44:07,057
Oh, our Rosemary,

567
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,848
you're marrying a person again?

568
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:11,012
What are you doing here again?

569
00:44:11,948 --> 00:44:13,697
We have nothing to meet over.

570
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,608
No, you sent us an invitation,

571
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:19,010
so why are you saying something else now?

572
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:22,479
President Hwang was busy,
so we came in place of him.

573
00:44:23,397 --> 00:44:26,777
Before, you didn't let him know,
and got in trouble.

574
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:30,245
This time, make sure you tell him,
okay? Isn't it like this?

575
00:44:31,456 --> 00:44:35,850
Invitation? Who sent the invitation?

576
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,978
Mother. I am Hyun Woo.

577
00:44:57,944 --> 00:44:58,798
Hyun Woo?

578
00:44:58,918 --> 00:45:00,853
Hyun Woo? Where is he?

579
00:45:01,512 --> 00:45:02,573
Where are you right now?

580
00:45:02,693 --> 00:45:04,254
Tell me where you are right now!

581
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:06,197
I'm going crazy because I'm so anxious.

582
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:08,499
what? Hotel?

583
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,278
Yes. Bring father, Hyun Min, Hyun Jib,

584
00:45:12,398 --> 00:45:15,469
all of them. I'll be waiting.

585
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,892
I got it. I'll be there.

586
00:45:18,012 --> 00:45:20,196
Before I get there, don't go anywhere!

587
00:45:21,441 --> 00:45:24,066
Honey, our Hyun Woo said he's at a hotel,

588
00:45:24,186 --> 00:45:25,910
and told us to go there quickly.

589
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,437
That kid finally came back.

590
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:31,688
He definitely will not pretend that he doesn't
know when his dad is in trouble.

591
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:34,146
What are you doing? Hyun Woo told you to go!

592
00:45:34,385 --> 00:45:37,003
Okay, I got it. Get dressed then come out.
I'll get the car ready.

593
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:39,221
He probably knew that you've
been forced out,

594
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:40,799
and booked a room at the hotel.

595
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:44,836
Why did he make us worry during this
time if he was going to come?

596
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:48,223
When I see him, I'll definitely use my
energy and beat him up.

597
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:52,797
Let's go.

598
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:05,076
Who were those people?

599
00:46:06,182 --> 00:46:08,173
People my father-in-law sent.

600
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:11,938
I don't know what happened,
but I think they were here to intimidate me.

601
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:16,267
Really? We're leaving anyways,
so don't think too much of it.

602
00:46:17,388 --> 00:46:19,269
But, you're not looking too good.

603
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:22,459
It's almost time for the official party.

604
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:25,843
Come. Can we go?

605
00:46:44,959 --> 00:46:46,171
Miss Yoon...

606
00:46:47,983 --> 00:46:49,828
Please talk with me for a while.

607
00:46:51,256 --> 00:46:54,176
I have something urgent going on,
so I must leave.

608
00:46:56,073 --> 00:46:59,443
Don't go. You can't go!

609
00:47:00,657 --> 00:47:02,147
What are you talking about?

610
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,893
I'm saying this because I think of you.

611
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,114
Please believe in my words and stay here.

612
00:47:08,234 --> 00:47:11,718
Only then will the wheels of the mistake
car be stopped. Only you...

613
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:13,827
Why exactly are you being like that to me?

614
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:17,257
This is my personal business;
I don't need your intervention.

615
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,408
I know your sister.

616
00:47:19,528 --> 00:47:21,598
She has important stuff to tend to today,

617
00:47:22,002 --> 00:47:24,924
but because she wants to see you,

618
00:47:25,044 --> 00:47:26,669
she might ruin it all.

619
00:47:27,242 --> 00:47:28,748
If you're really thinking of your sister,

620
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:31,248
please stop yourself from
going this one day.

621
00:47:31,647 --> 00:47:33,279
You know my sister?

622
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:38,906
Sorry, but I don't believe in your words.

623
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:40,701
We've already set up a meeting...

624
00:47:40,905 --> 00:47:42,920
and there's really no reason
to push it back.

625
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,059
Then. I'm going now.

626
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:46,777
You leave me with no choice.

627
00:47:47,885 --> 00:47:49,853
I'll call your sister...

628
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,772
you say it yourself.

629
00:47:52,573 --> 00:47:54,233
If you have courage to go after that,

630
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,500
then do as you wish.

631
00:48:01,803 --> 00:48:03,671
Give my sister a call?

632
00:48:03,963 --> 00:48:05,691
It's Joo Ah Ran?

633
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:10,442
What is the reason why the two of you
won't let me see my sister?

634
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:11,843
Hello?

635
00:48:11,963 --> 00:48:13,655
Isn't this Ah Ran's cell phone?

636
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:16,005
The bride probably left her cell phone here.

637
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:19,279
She's at the church right now,
and can't talk.

638
00:48:19,399 --> 00:48:20,856
Wedding church?

639
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:23,639
Who's the bride?

640
00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:25,020
Joo Ah Ran.

641
00:48:25,978 --> 00:48:27,903
She's getting married?

642
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:30,731
Where is it happening now?

643
00:48:31,962 --> 00:48:33,962
Where is the church?!

644
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:40,294
This is impossible.

645
00:48:41,548 --> 00:48:43,560
She's getting remarried to Shin Hyun Woo.

646
00:48:44,722 --> 00:48:46,267
Doing such foolish things.

647
00:48:49,079 --> 00:48:51,164
No, you can't go.

648
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:52,973
Two people's hatred...

649
00:48:53,093 --> 00:48:54,852
let the two of them solve it.

650
00:48:55,481 --> 00:48:58,686
Miss Yoon. You knew of it too?

651
00:49:00,182 --> 00:49:02,044
You allowed it even though you knew?

652
00:49:03,171 --> 00:49:07,058
Joo Ah Ran and Shin Hyun Woo getting remarried.
Isn't that ridiculous?

653
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:33,400
What are you doing right now?

654
00:49:57,551 --> 00:49:59,619
No. You can't go!

655
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:58,519
<i>Yes. Let's begin.</i>

656
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:04,869
<i>Holding Groom Ahn Jae Sung,
and bride Joo Ahn Ran's wedding.</i>

657
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:08,204
<i>The groom and bride are entering together.</i>

658
00:51:08,513 --> 00:51:11,612
<i>Groom. Bride. Enter!</i>

659
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:45,094
Isn't this song nice?

660
00:51:46,545 --> 00:51:50,094
Whenever I hear this song,
I feel so happy and blessed.

661
00:51:51,705 --> 00:51:55,799
Who chose this song?

662
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,736
Of course I chose it.

663
00:51:59,207 --> 00:52:01,835
Why? You don't like it?

664
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:07,103
No, I like it.

665
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:27,796
Why are you shaking like that?

666
00:52:28,715 --> 00:52:31,453
Don't be nervous. I'm here.

667
00:52:34,051 --> 00:52:35,460
I'm okay.

668
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,540
Where did he tell us to go in the hotel?

669
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,209
Hyun Woo didn't say anything?

670
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,077
Yes. He said that he'll see us
at the Seoul Hotel.

671
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:59,904
12th floor. Wedding Ceremony.

672
00:53:00,289 --> 00:53:05,081
Look at this. Groom Ahn Jae Sung,
bride Joo Ah Ran.

673
00:53:06,048 --> 00:53:09,259
Joo Ah Ran? No way.

674
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,686
What? It's not Nam Joo Seung either.

675
00:53:12,806 --> 00:53:15,473
Ahn Jae Sun and Joo Ah Ran
are getting married?

676
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:18,994
These guys. Where is the elevator?

677
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:25,169
<i>Right now, the bow that will bound them
together for 100 years.</i>

678
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:28,707
<i>Groom, Bride. Bow.</i>

679
00:53:34,729 --> 00:53:36,813
These ridiculous...

680
00:53:37,086 --> 00:53:38,623
It really is Joo Ah Ran!

681
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:41,161
How could something like this happen?

682
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:43,968
<i>She's still in the process of getting divorced,
now she's secretly getting married?</i>

683
00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:50,323
Just now my parents and brothers
have arrived.

684
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:53,949
After the wedding ends,
I'll introduce them to you.

685
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:03,465
Next, we'll see a presentation of the groom
and bride's happy life journey.

686
00:54:04,545 --> 00:54:06,017
Presentation?

687
00:54:56,226 --> 00:54:57,043
<i>I love you.</i>

688
00:54:57,163 --> 00:54:58,217
<i>I love you Joo Seung.</i>

689
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,496
<i>I love you.</i>

690
00:55:18,042 --> 00:55:19,967
Those are all lies.

691
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,153
Quickly, turn it off! Turn it off!

692
00:55:28,177 --> 00:55:31,633
Was that... Ah Ran's real self?

693
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:35,417
Someone who proposed love
to 3 different men...

694
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:37,858
how can I trust you?

695
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:43,485
No. It must be someone's prank.

696
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:53,071
Where is Shin Hyun Woo? Come out.

697
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:55,223
Hurry up and come out!

698
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:58,397
If you have something to say,
appear before me!

699
00:55:58,517 --> 00:56:01,540
Don't hide like a coward. Come out!

700
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:04,510
<i>Joo Ah Ran.</i>

701
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,857
Do you still remember me?

702
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,450
I'm the security guard that used to
work at the Yang Pyeong villa.

703
00:56:10,957 --> 00:56:13,041
What are you talking about?

704
00:56:14,098 --> 00:56:15,516
I don't know you.

705
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:18,840
The money you gave me,
I have the record right here.

706
00:56:19,141 --> 00:56:20,618
You say you don't know me?

707
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:23,357
You locked up Shin Hyun Woo and the nurse

708
00:56:23,477 --> 00:56:25,259
and told me to watch them.

709
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:29,858
I am the physician Joo Ah Ran found.

710
00:56:29,978 --> 00:56:34,944
She told me that she'll give me a huge amount
of money if I pretended to be a doctor.

711
00:56:35,273 --> 00:56:38,587
So I pretended to be Shin Hyun Woo's doctor.

712
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:41,395
I have also seen you.

713
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,882
From our villa, we could see your villa.

714
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:50,290
You always had a security guard guarding the villa,
which was weird.

715
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,900
Who are you?

716
00:56:53,055 --> 00:56:54,571
Don't intervene in other people's business.

717
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,115
Shut up. Go away!

718
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:57,636
Also, there's another important truth.

719
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:02,988
One day, when I was getting some
air on my balcony...

720
00:57:03,439 --> 00:57:06,210
I saw you running out of the burning villa.

721
00:57:06,755 --> 00:57:07,872
The clothes you wore at that time,

722
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:09,299
I remember them very clearly.

723
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:11,515
<i>But, after the incident, I heard that</i>

724
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:15,581
in that villa, there was a patient
who was unable to move.

725
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:19,461
Lies! It wasn't me.

726
00:57:20,643 --> 00:57:22,722
Someone told you to do this, didn't they?

727
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:24,778
They gave you money, didn't they?

728
00:57:25,754 --> 00:57:27,227
<i>I saw it too.</i>

729
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:31,899
This woman was driving really fast,
and almost hit my child.

730
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:35,328
Not long after that,
I heard the ambulance's sound.

731
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:40,524
On one night,
I saw her push a person in a wheelchair.

732
00:57:40,644 --> 00:57:44,142
<i>It was too scary.
I had nightmares for a lot of nights.</i>

733
00:58:29,989 --> 00:58:31,397
Joo Ah Ran.

734
00:58:32,313 --> 00:58:34,428
Why aren't you saying anything?

735
00:58:35,966 --> 00:58:38,407
At least try to defend yourself a little.

736
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:45,177
The real Ah Ran that's hiding underneath
that pretty face...

737
00:58:45,994 --> 00:58:47,865
how many are there?

738
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:53,616
Shin Hyun Woo, did you really kill him?

739
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,499
No. No!

740
00:58:58,419 --> 00:59:02,063
I didn't kill! I'm innocent.

741
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:04,475
I didn't know of this.

742
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:15,795
Enough! Everyone stop!

743
00:59:25,513 --> 00:59:29,927
Nam Joo Seung. What are you doing right now?

744
00:59:31,138 --> 00:59:34,668
Other people's sacred weddings,
is this something that you can intervene in?

745
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:37,123
Hurry up and go back!

746
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:38,755
Must you be like this?

747
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:41,912
A woman you have once loved...

748
00:59:42,551 --> 00:59:45,161
must you step all over her to get happiness?

749
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:48,404
You were treated that because of a reason!

750
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:51,888
The victim also have responsibility.

751
00:59:53,503 --> 00:59:55,566
Don't say anything. Come with me.

752
00:59:57,933 --> 01:00:02,426
Wait a minute, you have yet to account for the crime
you've committed against my brother.

753
01:00:03,445 --> 01:00:04,910
Joo Ah Ran..

754
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,913
My innocent and kind younger brother,
why did you kill him?

755
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:11,805
After you stole his design...

756
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:14,021
and satisfied your wish, that is enough.

757
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:16,931
Why did my poor brother have to die?

758
01:00:17,051 --> 01:00:19,307
Didn't I already settle my debt with you?

759
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,504
Why are you here again?

760
01:00:21,624 --> 01:00:23,894
The person is dead. What debts are finished?

761
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:26,659
Using your snake tongue...

762
01:00:26,779 --> 01:00:29,721
did you think saying sorry would
grant you forgiveness?

763
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:34,268
Crime, will eventually come back like a boomerang,
didn't you know?

764
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:36,259
Suicide was that person's choice.

765
01:00:37,588 --> 01:00:39,528
He was depressed about his life...

766
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,969
strictly speaking, that's not
my responsibility.

767
01:00:42,974 --> 01:00:45,286
Do you have evidence that I killed him?

768
01:00:45,556 --> 01:00:47,469
The mentally unstable brother,

769
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,332
by neglecting him,

770
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,467
isn't that your responsibility?

771
01:00:51,711 --> 01:00:56,943
My brother was afraid of that,
so he recorded your voice.

772
01:00:58,106 --> 01:00:59,815
My brother's present

773
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,190
to the woman he loved.

774
01:01:03,647 --> 01:01:05,995
<i>Without you, SOUL is still doing
really well.</i>

775
01:01:06,115 --> 01:01:08,910
<i>There are a lot of top designers on
the on the streets,</i>

776
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:11,731
<i>don't stay around and get lost!</i>

777
01:01:12,031 --> 01:01:13,534
<i>Annoying! So annoying!</i>

778
01:01:13,654 --> 01:01:15,740
<i>Why are you sticking to me like a parasite?</i>

779
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,970
<i>I don't love you. I love your designs.</i>

780
01:01:21,164 --> 01:01:22,647
So it's like this.

781
01:01:23,268 --> 01:01:26,648
You killed Jung Sang Mo like this too?

782
01:01:28,263 --> 01:01:30,873
How many secrets are out there
that I don't know?

783
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:37,224
Just now, the black box from Shin Hyun Woo's
accident had been found.

784
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,896
It was very damaged...

785
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,353
but I'm curious to see how
well it was restored.

786
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:44,303
Black Box.

787
01:01:48,277 --> 01:01:50,127
<i>If you have found the couple ring,</i>

788
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:52,565
<i>then you should know who
it is I love, right?</i>

789
01:01:52,685 --> 01:01:54,350
<i>Nam Joo Seung is my brother!</i>

790
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:55,645
<i>And also my parents' directing doctor.</i>

791
01:01:55,765 --> 01:01:56,830
<i>He is also my man!</i>

792
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,236
<i>No! No!</i>

793
01:02:17,763 --> 01:02:20,552
Why isn't she here yet?

794
01:02:20,786 --> 01:02:22,627
She said she'd be here at 12!

795
01:02:22,747 --> 01:02:25,428
Right. It's driving people crazy.

796
01:02:26,095 --> 01:02:29,053
<i>The person you're looking for doesn't
seem to be here yet.</i>

797
01:02:29,173 --> 01:02:32,320
Right. Circle round a few more times.

798
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,660
We must find our daughter. Go.

799
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:40,122
The coffee shop IS here, isn't it?

800
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:43,218
Do you want to go outside and
look for her? Hurry.

801
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:52,938
Sorry, but where is the wedding ceremony?

802
01:02:53,058 --> 01:02:55,531
A hotel is for eating, and sleeping.
Why would there be weddings?

803
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:57,850
We're very busy, ask elsewhere.

804
01:03:03,437 --> 01:03:08,108
Joo Ah Ran. How could you do those
things to Hyun Woo.

805
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:10,170
Are you still trying to live like this?

806
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:12,452
You're not satisfied with just
killing your husband,

807
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:14,856
but also forcing your in-laws
out on the streets,

808
01:03:15,245 --> 01:03:17,590
<i>and marrying some other guy.</i>

809
01:03:18,013 --> 01:03:19,924
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

810
01:03:20,044 --> 01:03:21,938
<i>You cruel and vicious person!</i>

811
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:28,356
So it's like this.

812
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,054
This was all devised by you, wasn't it?

813
01:03:35,518 --> 01:03:38,264
After I stole your fortune,
you feel wronged,

814
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,423
so you hired people to act as witnesses,

815
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:42,968
<i>and made a ridiculous video.</i>

816
01:03:43,268 --> 01:03:44,902
Compared to your son,

817
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:47,075
is losing your fortune that much worse?

818
01:03:47,944 --> 01:03:51,521
You wanted to ruin my wedding,
and did all this, right?

819
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:53,452
Just like you said...

820
01:03:53,737 --> 01:03:56,982
crime will not rot away,
and will grow bigger.

821
01:03:57,724 --> 01:04:00,963
<i>So now the truth has been revealed.</i>

822
01:04:01,357 --> 01:04:06,118
Yet you still don't admit it, do you?

823
01:04:09,648 --> 01:04:11,075
I'll be the last witness.

824
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:17,967
Nurse Yoon! Don't say anything!

825
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:20,063
Don't do something that you'll regret.

826
01:04:20,183 --> 01:04:23,603
No, it's because I was too clear,
during this period of time,

827
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:27,247
about Shin Hyun Woo and his family's
many sufferings.

828
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:29,934
So I must say them. I must!

829
01:04:30,958 --> 01:04:34,395
I am a nurse that tended to Shin Hyun Woo

830
01:04:34,515 --> 01:04:37,014
at the Yang Pyeong villa.

831
01:04:37,259 --> 01:04:39,862
The Joo Ah Ran and Director Nam here,

832
01:04:39,982 --> 01:04:42,761
they prevented me from giving treatment.

833
01:04:43,006 --> 01:04:45,503
They gave up on the patient completely,
and left him to die.

834
01:04:45,623 --> 01:04:47,200
Shut that mouth!

835
01:04:48,076 --> 01:04:50,074
You don't know anything yet
you appeared here?

836
01:04:50,336 --> 01:04:51,265
Get out right now.

837
01:04:51,385 --> 01:04:52,574
Not only that...

838
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:55,857
she poured hot water on the patient,
causing life-threatening damage.

839
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,270
She also tortured him mentally.

840
01:04:58,674 --> 01:05:02,382
Shin Hyun Woo,
after regaining consciousness,

841
01:05:02,739 --> 01:05:04,651
feared his wife's revenge.

842
01:05:05,086 --> 01:05:07,659
He hid the fact that he was still awake.

843
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,454
Joo Ah Ran, before causing the fire,

844
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:14,430
was a murderer that killed
her husband's soul.

845
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:22,375
Jae Sung, we've gotten into a trap.

846
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:24,695
They're all framing me.

847
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:29,606
Truthfully, Shin Hyun Woo died
because of a gas explosion.

848
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:31,509
I wasn't at the scene at all.

849
01:05:31,629 --> 01:05:33,808
The accident had nothing to
do with me at all.

850
01:05:34,152 --> 01:05:37,509
What if I don't believe you?

851
01:05:37,629 --> 01:05:39,181
You have to believe me!

852
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:43,326
Plug your ears, close your eyes,
only listen to me.

853
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,552
A wedding ceremony is not needed,

854
01:05:48,672 --> 01:05:49,730
let's just leave.

855
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:51,885
<i>Just like we planned,</i>

856
01:05:52,005 --> 01:05:54,448
let's go to a new country
and begin a new life.

857
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:58,962
I love you. Didn't you say you love me too?

858
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:00,853
So, the past doesn't matter.

859
01:06:01,272 --> 01:06:02,370
Let's leave!

860
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:04,116
Let's leave right now!

861
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:06,107
You took away someone's life,

862
01:06:06,854 --> 01:06:09,213
and then you that ruined
everything in their life.

863
01:06:10,093 --> 01:06:12,853
But for your own happiness,
you're still standing here?

864
01:06:13,544 --> 01:06:18,262
You're shameful and ridiculous.
I'll make sure...

865
01:06:19,025 --> 01:06:23,219
that all of your crimes come crawling out
of your mouth like bugs.

866
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:26,435
Until the day you die...

867
01:06:26,822 --> 01:06:29,005
you'll pay for all of your crimes.

868
01:06:35,956 --> 01:06:37,797
What? Who are you?

869
01:06:38,961 --> 01:06:40,524
You still don't know?

870
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:45,029
The Romeo whose heart was stolen.

871
01:06:46,026 --> 01:06:50,809
The one you killed.. 
your husband Shin Hyun Woo.

880
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:06,664
PREVIEW:

881
01:08:06,784 --> 01:08:09,105
The Ahn Jae Sung that said he loved me.

882
01:08:09,225 --> 01:08:11,241
Look closely at reality!

883
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:13,016
It is more painful than death.

884
01:08:13,136 --> 01:08:14,891
I will let you have a true taste of what it
feels like to be worse than death.

885
01:08:15,011 --> 01:08:16,126
Are you really my son Hyun Woo?

886
01:08:16,246 --> 01:08:17,007
Yes.

887
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:18,403
No mistake,
it's our son Hyun Woo!

888
01:08:18,523 --> 01:08:19,635
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

889
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:20,741
Leave it to me.

890
01:08:20,861 --> 01:08:21,983
I want to get married to Jae Hee.

891
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:24,105
Marriage? As long as it's not with
Joo Chul Min's children.

892
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,290
This wedding cannot be. I don't approve.

893
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,913
Jae Hee is not the same as Ah Ran!

894
01:08:28,006 --> 01:08:29,490
Actually, they're the same!

895
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:32,544
<i>That man. I definitely cannot give
him to Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

896
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:34,128
Who are you?

897
01:08:34,248 --> 01:08:35,384
<i>Are you going to do it to the end?</i>

898
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:36,724
<i>Do you still not understand?</i>

899
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,239
<i>Your Dad, killed my parents in front of me.</i>

900
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,455
<i>Let's see whose crime was bigger.
You should be able to tell without calculating, right?</i>

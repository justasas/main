Final Episode 21

3
00:00:05,312 --> 00:00:07,613
President, you don't know, right?

4
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,312
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,

5
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:11,674
is Madam.

6
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,825
What?

7
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:16,219
Is this fellow crazy?

8
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:20,515
You don't know that Madam was the one
who tampered with the wheels, right?

9
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:22,900
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,679
<i>and the person who plunged
the sisters into tragedy,</i>

11
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,428
was Madam!

12
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:30,132
<i>What are you saying?</i>

13
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:32,311
No matter how much you hate your mother,

14
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:34,189
you can't spout nonsense like that.

15
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,063
If you doubt me, ask Madam directly.

16
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:41,861
Who was the person who
tampered with the wheels,

17
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:43,720
who was the person who
killed Ah Ran's parents,

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,000
tell him everything!

19
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:51,746
Honey,

20
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,150
forgive me.

21
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:58,905
Then, it's true?

22
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,088
How could you?!

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,797
It's not!

24
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,882
The person who brutally trampled
on Ah Ran's entire family...

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,210
was Madam.

26
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,581
Up till now,

27
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:15,872
can President's family point fingers
at Ah Ran and blame her?

28
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,107
Hyun Woo is still alive,

29
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:19,816
but Ah Ran's parents are dead,

30
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:22,357
who should be punished?

31
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:23,803
Do you not feel shame?

32
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:26,413
All the guilt is mine,

33
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,267
why are you blaming Hyun Woo?

34
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:31,108
It doesn't matter if it was
the traffic accident,

35
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:32,290
or setting fire to burn him to death,

36
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,056
from the beginning you should
have tried to kill me.

37
00:01:34,176 --> 00:01:36,497
It's not too late yet!

38
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,524
If dying is your wish,

39
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:47,127
I'll grant it.

40
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,200
- Ah Ran.
- You want to die?

41
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:53,489
What are you waiting for?

42
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:56,155
My father and my mother are waiting for you!

43
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,089
Ah Ran, wait a while.

44
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:00,005
Let go!

45
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,658
Hurry in.

46
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,180
I've talked to Joo Ah Ran,

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,734
she doesn't seem to have any intention
of extending the invoice period.

48
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:37,954
What should we do?

49
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,993
By the end of business hours today,
you'll officially be declared bankrupt.

50
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:43,570
Don't worry too much.

51
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,593
I've already made preparations
for the official declaration.

52
00:02:46,713 --> 00:02:47,300
What?

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:49,805
I've separated Soul and SM.

54
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:55,542
Soul was originally a wedding present to
Joo Ah Ran when we got married.

55
00:02:55,662 --> 00:02:59,880
Now, I am going over with
no regrets to SM Furniture.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,969
Then, if Soul Furniture goes bankrupt,
will there be no impact on SM Furniture?

57
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:07,432
It's difficult right now because
there is no capital,

58
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:11,562
but I just have to act like the beginning,
gritting my teeth and running a little more.

59
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,041
Compared to this,

60
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:16,389
I have something to tell you Jae Hee.

61
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,028
I can't believe this.

62
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:22,065
{\a6}Last Episode

63
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:22,841
<i>The person who has been
sponsoring me all this time,</i>

64
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:27,161
is the person who killed my parents.

65
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,208
Then,

66
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:31,668
with my parents' lives,

67
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,678
I traded it for clothes,

68
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,716
presents,

69
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:38,213
and even college?
Is that right?

70
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,101
Don't feel burdened,

71
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:45,765
to Mother, it was some kind of redemption.

72
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:48,601
Why was she so cruel?

73
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:52,544
She didn't have to kill someone innocent.

74
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:57,284
Maybe she was afraid her
secret would be exposed,

75
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,275
and lost her mind.

76
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:04,366
If only she was calmer and more rational,

77
00:04:04,486 --> 00:04:06,601
things would have been better.

78
00:04:13,148 --> 00:04:14,613
Yes, Father.

79
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:17,637
What?

80
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,563
Do you know where this place is?

81
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:40,528
Because of you, my parents didn't
even know why they died.

82
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,838
This is my parents' grave!

83
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,479
In this cold water,

84
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,746
only the ashes of my parents are left.

85
00:04:50,866 --> 00:04:52,943
What do you have to say?

86
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,126
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,121
I will apologize.

88
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:04,746
If you want me to die, I'll die.

89
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:06,644
Apologize?

90
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:09,693
What's the use of an apology?!

91
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:12,614
Can my dead parents come back?

92
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:15,956
Can my tragic life be changed?

93
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,729
<i>Because of you, I became a lunatic,</i>

94
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:24,710
I became a criminal that
tried to kill my husband.

95
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:27,940
All of this, how are you going to repay me?

96
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,315
Follow me.

97
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:57,835
Ah... Ah Ran.

98
00:05:58,587 --> 00:05:59,957
It's me.

99
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:01,009
Where are you right now?

100
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:02,511
I'll go there.

101
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:03,657
<i>Forget it.</i>

102
00:06:03,777 --> 00:06:06,296
<i>I don't need your help anymore.</i>

103
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:09,995
<i>The person who should have died
wasn't Shin Hyun Woo, but Jo Kyung Hee.</i>

104
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:10,991
No...

105
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:12,305
Ah Ran!

106
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,277
You can't, Ah Ran!

107
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:39,198
I've found out the location of the taxi that
Ah Ran is taking by the car plate number.

108
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,240
It's better if you go look there,

109
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,414
I have a bad feeling.

110
00:06:45,852 --> 00:06:47,561
Yeo Ju.

111
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,646
If it's Yeo Ju...

112
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:53,852
It's the wooden lodge where she held me!

113
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:03,572
You said you wanted to
die to apologize, right?

114
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:07,821
Then just die in front of me.

115
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,802
All this is already out in the open,

116
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,652
there is no other choice for you.

117
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:29,558
Do you want to pour it yourself,
or should I do it for you?

118
00:07:29,678 --> 00:07:30,759
Ah Ran.

119
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,656
Why?

120
00:07:33,313 --> 00:07:35,623
Are you afraid of dying?

121
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,755
I know you hate me,

122
00:07:46,506 --> 00:07:48,928
but I still want to apologize to you.

123
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:52,297
Because of a criminal like me,

124
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,363
stop doing things that destroy your life.

125
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,297
If you want,

126
00:07:56,973 --> 00:07:59,396
I will die quietly by myself.

127
00:08:00,344 --> 00:08:02,861
Stop pretending to be pathetic.

128
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:06,279
Do you think I'll let you off this way?

129
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:11,258
There's nothing else to destroy
or abandon in my life.

130
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:16,084
Traffic accident, murder charges,
running away, arson,

131
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,131
ten fingers are not enough.

132
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,000
Someone like me,

133
00:08:22,733 --> 00:08:25,512
even if I kill the people
who killed my parents,

134
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:28,047
is not enough for me.

135
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:41,731
Alright.

136
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:44,567
Let's die.

137
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,130
There's nothing else to hold on to,
or to cling on to.

138
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:54,344
Life, if we suffer through our life,
it's hell.

139
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:55,865
Now...

140
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,940
I want to shed this burden too.

141
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,254
When you die and meet my parents,

142
00:09:34,177 --> 00:09:36,450
you have to kneel and beg
for their forgiveness.

143
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,567
When they forgive you,

144
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,299
I'll offer a cup of wine at your tombstone.

145
00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,321
Joo Ah Ran, stop!

146
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:28,756
Don't come over!

147
00:10:28,876 --> 00:10:31,347
If you come over, your mother will die.

148
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,171
What is this?

149
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:38,768
The crimes that you've
committed aren't enough,

150
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,646
what else do you want to do?!

151
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,049
Kyeong Ran, you stay out of this.

152
00:10:43,821 --> 00:10:46,206
My hands are soiled,

153
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:48,591
I'll end this by myself.

154
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:51,896
<i>Don't watch anything.</i>

155
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:54,234
Just pretend you don't
know anything forever.

156
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,939
Please listen to me and stop.

157
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:00,845
I'll stop pursuing everything
that you've done to me.

158
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:02,601
I haven't handed the evidence to the police.

159
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,418
It doesn't matter if you do!

160
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:08,517
Now, I've met the real culprit.

161
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:12,012
<i>You've suffered so much too,</i>

162
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:15,636
now, you should let your
mother suffer it too!

163
00:11:32,739 --> 00:11:34,034
What...

164
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,795
What are you doing now?

165
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:38,927
I,

166
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,765
don't have a mother,

167
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,830
or a father.

168
00:11:44,525 --> 00:11:48,037
I've missed my family so
much all this while.

169
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:51,972
<i>It's been so hard to find my sister.</i>

170
00:11:54,038 --> 00:11:58,489
I don't want to send you to
prison and leave me alone.

171
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,638
If something happens to Madam,

172
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,206
you'll never return to being my Unni.

173
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:10,680
If you still want to light the fire,
light it.

174
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,269
Here...

175
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:16,326
I'll die with Madam.

176
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,113
You can't,

177
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,874
you can't... my poor parents.

178
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:03,756
What will happen to my poor parents?!

179
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,851
I put it on you because the smell
of the gasoline is too choking.

180
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:49,122
Why do you do something
like that so casually?

181
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,991
Did you endure it for me?

182
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:57,707
I said we would die together,

183
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:00,204
you got scared, right?

184
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:04,918
What does it matter to me if you died?

185
00:14:05,633 --> 00:14:07,962
I just didn't have the courage.

186
00:14:08,901 --> 00:14:10,497
Actually, I...

187
00:14:11,755 --> 00:14:13,952
have something to tell you.

188
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:18,540
When I found out you were my Unni,

189
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,883
I prayed to the Heavens.

190
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:26,277
I don't need an Unni like that,

191
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:30,401
quickly take her away.

192
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:35,697
<i>I was afraid to break up with Hyun Woo,</i>

193
00:14:36,979 --> 00:14:40,115
that's why I had such frightening thoughts.

194
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,946
I'm really...

195
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,874
horrible, right?

196
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:54,315
I have something to confess too.

197
00:14:58,442 --> 00:15:01,297
When our parents died,

198
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,769
it was the day Dad was supposed
to go away for business.

199
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:11,797
But I wanted a birthday celebration,

200
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:16,334
so I was throwing a tantrum.

201
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,433
To have dinner together,

202
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,775
to buy presents together.

203
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:27,174
If Dad had gone away like
he was supposed to,

204
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:32,394
they wouldn't have died like that.

205
00:15:36,293 --> 00:15:39,016
I'm afraid to say it's my fault,

206
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,711
that's why I push the blame
on other people more,

207
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,531
that might be the case.

208
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,315
What's the reason you demanded to be
let out of the hospital so quickly?

209
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,381
Where did Mum go?

210
00:16:11,301 --> 00:16:13,761
Did Mum... get into trouble again?

211
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,958
Don't blame your mother.

212
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,440
When she comes home,

213
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,693
don't say anything,
and treat her with warmth.

214
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:25,914
<i>Horrible person.</i>

215
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,089
<i>She must have endured so
much pain for so many years.</i>

216
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:34,633
<i>If I had told her I knew about her
relationship with Secretary Nam,</i>

217
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,979
<i>all this tragedy wouldn't have happened.</i>

218
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:41,059
<i>All this is my fault.</i>

219
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:43,613
Mum!

220
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,983
Father, what's going on?

221
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,448
Did you get discharged?

222
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:52,170
I won't be able to walk even
if I stay in the hospital.

223
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,569
I got a lot of painkillers, don't worry.

224
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:57,635
Is your Mum alright?

225
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,406
Yes.

226
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:03,241
Joo Ah Ran was taken away by Jae Hee.

227
00:17:03,361 --> 00:17:04,124
But...

228
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:05,814
But what is this smell?

229
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,880
Isn't it gasoline?

230
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,701
You said you were with Joo Ah Ran,

231
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,349
could she have poured gasoline on Mum?

232
00:17:14,044 --> 00:17:15,753
No!

233
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,213
I'm going in to shower.

234
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,058
Is Oppa a fool?

235
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:27,669
You risked your life to undergo
full-body plastic surgery,

236
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:30,842
but where's the Oppa that wanted
to take revenge on Joo Ah Ran?

237
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,812
If Oppa can't do it, I will.

238
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,235
I won't let that woman,

239
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,056
Joo Ah Ran, go!

240
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,825
Are you looking at the photographs?

241
00:18:33,945 --> 00:18:35,571
That was when I was younger,

242
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,937
I was quite ugly, right?

243
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,995
If our parents were alive,

244
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:47,619
you wouldn't be living like that either.

245
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:51,938
When you went to school,

246
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:55,104
did anyone tease you for being
from an orphanage?

247
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:56,737
So what if I did?

248
00:18:56,857 --> 00:18:59,479
It was just because they didn't know better,

249
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:01,789
I was fine with it.

250
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,896
You don't need to lie to me.

251
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:08,634
<i>What is an orphan,</i>

252
00:19:08,754 --> 00:19:10,793
what is poverty,

253
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:14,117
I've felt it in my bones too.

254
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,482
What you see might not be true.

255
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:20,900
Orphans and people in poverty
don't have to live unhappy.

256
00:19:21,353 --> 00:19:25,954
Because they have dreams,
tomorrow might be a happier day.

257
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:30,142
Compared to this, Madam's life is hell.

258
00:19:30,732 --> 00:19:32,197
Thinking about the way she lived,

259
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:34,743
she's already made her repentance,

260
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:35,952
let's just forget it.

261
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:38,056
How can we forget it?

262
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,906
25 years turns her into an innocent victim,

263
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:45,158
but makes me a cold-blooded murderer.

264
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:48,013
What in the world do I have to forget,

265
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,703
or to forgive?

266
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:09,673
<i>[Madam]</i>

267
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,404
<i>The person who gave birth to you was Mum,</i>

268
00:20:16,117 --> 00:20:18,634
<i>the person you hate is also Mother!</i>

269
00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:22,446
<i>You feel it's right to personally send the
person who gave birth to you to her death?</i>

270
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:28,066
What do you plan to do with Joo Ah Ran?

271
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:32,648
I don't know what would be
the right call to make either.

272
00:20:34,373 --> 00:20:36,758
To you and Hyun Woo,

273
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:40,319
even though this might sound ridiculous,

274
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:43,669
but could we absolve her crimes legally?

275
00:20:44,165 --> 00:20:45,592
Because,

276
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:47,677
Ah Ran has lost a lot too.

277
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,780
I share the same thoughts as your mother,

278
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,386
because if your mother is
a criminal, so am I.

279
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:56,306
If Ah Ran comes to any trouble,
our family won't be free either.

280
00:20:56,426 --> 00:20:58,315
Sending Ah Ran to jail,

281
00:20:58,435 --> 00:21:00,719
you won't feel comfortable either.

282
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,536
Then, I'll become the real culprit
of the traffic accident.

283
00:21:05,656 --> 00:21:07,827
If they find out that Joo Ah Ran
is the driver,

284
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,776
then she'll be convicted for running away.

285
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:13,530
Just take it that you're
repenting for the crime

286
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,765
that your mother committed 25 years ago.

287
00:21:15,885 --> 00:21:17,267
Prepare yourself,

288
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:18,882
please.

289
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,956
You grew up beautifully.

290
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,526
I really wanted to...

291
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:49,390
do everything for you like a mother.

292
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:56,401
But after we've really met,
I can't do anything for you.

293
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,072
Like you said,

294
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:07,244
were my methods wrong?

295
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:17,053
The two of us are living such tiring lives,

296
00:22:20,076 --> 00:22:23,213
why can't I have the same thoughts as you?

297
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,887
<i>I'm sorry Unni.</i>

298
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:31,779
<i>Tiring Unni out like that,</i>

299
00:22:32,943 --> 00:22:35,422
<i>from loving Shin Hyun Woo,</i>

300
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:40,048
<i>and Unni loving Ahn Jae Sung,</i>

301
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:46,151
<i>our parents wouldn't want to see
the way we take revenge too.</i>

302
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:56,241
Hyun Ji!

303
00:22:56,361 --> 00:22:58,178
Did you see the flashdrive in my room?

304
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:00,525
I left it on my bed.

305
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,065
I didn't see it.

306
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:03,211
What is it?

307
00:23:03,331 --> 00:23:06,816
Ah, it's really important,
where did I drop it?

308
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:16,667
Ah Ran...

309
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:20,230
we've decided to accept her.

310
00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:24,758
If there's a need,
we'll write her a recognition letter.

311
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:26,542
No matter what,

312
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:29,190
help her to forget the past
and start afresh.

313
00:23:30,552 --> 00:23:32,299
Hyun Woo Hyung,

314
00:23:32,768 --> 00:23:34,289
has agreed too?

315
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,548
Of course.

316
00:23:35,668 --> 00:23:38,496
Hyun Woo's father feels the same way too.

317
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:41,369
If there's time,

318
00:23:43,765 --> 00:23:46,375
can you go somewhere with me?

319
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:02,889
Joo Seung's father,

320
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,498
it's been a long time.

321
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,612
I never thought there would be a day,

322
00:24:10,732 --> 00:24:14,819
where Joo Seung and I will come
and see you together.

323
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,474
The day you died,

324
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:24,737
I stayed outside your hospital
door and never came in,

325
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:27,160
<i>you can understand, right?</i>

326
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:31,697
My cowardice,

327
00:24:31,817 --> 00:24:34,382
please forgive it.

328
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:38,908
The life that was supposed
to end a long time ago,

329
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,200
because of you,

330
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,905
I lived a long time.

331
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:54,368
Thank you.

332
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,440
- Let's go.
- Joo Seung.

333
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:24,508
Just once...

334
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:29,559
Could you call me Mother?

335
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:36,040
From the beginning, I never had a mother.

336
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:39,232
In the future as well.

337
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:11,249
<i>Joo Ah Ran.</i>

338
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,756
<i>Even if everyone in our family forgives you,</i>

339
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,104
<i>I'll never be able to.</i>

340
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:18,376
<i>Everything that you did to our family,</i>

341
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,911
<i>I want you to pay it back one by one.</i>

342
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:26,413
It's the police.

343
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,849
What are you doing right now?

344
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,178
Where is Joo Ah Ran?

345
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,525
I don't know.

346
00:26:38,645 --> 00:26:40,265
From the black box and the fingerprints
that Shin Hyun Woo provided,

347
00:26:40,385 --> 00:26:42,726
we've come to a conclusion.

348
00:26:42,846 --> 00:26:46,999
The traffic accident at Chang Yuan,
and the arson at Yang Pyeong,

349
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,365
the suspect is Joo Ah Ran.

350
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:52,557
Shin Hyun Woo.

351
00:26:53,363 --> 00:26:55,485
The person who reported
it was Shin Hyun Woo?

352
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:02,192
This is the spinach I made,

353
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,689
I'm good at cooking.

354
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,506
Try the fish soup too.

355
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,009
I was really determined,

356
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,083
and went to the market to buy a big fish.

357
00:27:14,677 --> 00:27:17,400
Wretch, why are you showing off?

358
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:21,381
You think no one else can do it?

359
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,541
At Aunt's house,

360
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:27,870
I made food till I had calluses on my hands.

361
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:34,539
After we eat,

362
00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:37,543
shall we shower together?

363
00:27:37,663 --> 00:27:39,834
I shower by myself every day,

364
00:27:39,954 --> 00:27:42,679
no one scrubs my back for me.

365
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:47,562
Where are you going?

366
00:27:47,682 --> 00:27:49,985
If you don't want to, it's fine too.

367
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:52,348
Are you in a bad mood?

368
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:54,451
Didn't you want to shower?

369
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:56,498
We have to fill the tub.

370
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:11,202
What's wrong?

371
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,063
Are you crying?

372
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,617
Who's crying?

373
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,495
It's just tiring.

374
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,716
Don't save money,

375
00:28:24,561 --> 00:28:28,223
go to the spa to get your
back scrubbed sometimes.

376
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,599
I can do it for you when I'm around,

377
00:28:34,716 --> 00:28:38,171
but I don't know what will
happen in the future.

378
00:28:38,904 --> 00:28:40,725
Why are you saying that?

379
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:44,322
Hyun Woo said he won't pursue the past,

380
00:28:45,148 --> 00:28:47,739
everything will be alright from now on.

381
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:49,880
Don't think about those things.

382
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:04,041
<i>[Joo Seung]</i>

383
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:20,084
Ah Ran,

384
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:23,316
hurry pick up the phone!

385
00:29:23,436 --> 00:29:26,096
The police are after you!

386
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:36,529
Joo Seung, it's me.

387
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,857
Why are you not picking up your phone?

388
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,190
<i>Something big has happened.</i>

389
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,697
<i>Hurry and run away from there now.</i>

390
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:45,552
Shin Hyun Woo has handed over the black box,

391
00:29:45,672 --> 00:29:48,425
the police could be on their way!

392
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,336
I got it.

393
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:54,134
What happened?

394
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:56,001
The police are after me.

395
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:57,522
I have to go out.

396
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,471
It's too dangerous by yourself,
I'll go with you.

397
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,461
Kyeong Ran, you stay here.

398
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:05,203
I don't want you to be tired
out because of me.

399
00:30:05,323 --> 00:30:07,504
Where are you going to go?

400
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:08,593
That's right.

401
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:09,945
You can go to the Angel Orphanage.

402
00:30:11,962 --> 00:30:13,663
I'll call the Director,

403
00:30:13,783 --> 00:30:14,997
you can go hide there for
a day or two first.

404
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:17,801
I'll clarify the situation
before calling you.

405
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:23,359
It's cold, you have to watch
out for your health.

406
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,557
Take a cab.

407
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,060
During this period of time, use my phone,

408
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,862
got it?

409
00:30:41,448 --> 00:30:42,950
Unni!

410
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:56,459
Unni,

411
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:59,157
you have to be fine.

412
00:30:59,277 --> 00:31:01,636
If something happens,

413
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,852
I will really hate you then.

414
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:10,750
Kyeong Ran, so you're a crybaby,

415
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,760
how silly.

416
00:31:13,774 --> 00:31:16,478
Unni will come back soon,
why are you crying?

417
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,866
Unni will be back soon,

418
00:31:21,986 --> 00:31:23,801
I promise.

419
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:42,765
In order for things to happen this way,

420
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:45,356
did you try to give us some peace?

421
00:31:45,788 --> 00:31:48,586
Is this the end of your revenge?

422
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,511
Like a hypocrite,

423
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:52,558
you only said the good things,

424
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,018
from beginning till end, you didn't
shed a drop of blood, or a tear,

425
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:56,915
and you're expecting Ah Ran to die?

426
00:31:57,035 --> 00:31:58,661
It's a misunderstanding,

427
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:00,714
I never handed the flashdrive over.

428
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,461
Then who did?

429
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:07,625
Besides the victim, who else is there?!

430
00:32:10,468 --> 00:32:13,154
Don't be agitated, let's think of a way.

431
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:16,985
Once the flashdrive's content is exposed,
everything Ah Ran did will be uncovered.

432
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:20,083
Then, even when we write the letter,
nothing will be of use.

433
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:22,775
I have to make a trip to the police station.

434
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:28,634
What?

435
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:31,199
Shin Hyun Ji?

436
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,358
Since we already have concrete evidence,

437
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,311
we have to launch a formal investigation
against Joo Ah Ran.

438
00:32:35,431 --> 00:32:37,771
<i>The police are arresting her right now.</i>

439
00:32:37,891 --> 00:32:39,837
I'm sorry,

440
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,582
but could you give Joo Ah Ran more time?

441
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:45,286
If the victim submits a letter that
he doesn't want to pursue charges,

442
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:46,319
what will happen?

443
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:49,361
Although it can be used for
reference during the jury,

444
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:50,835
running away from the police,

445
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:52,845
is something that cannot be pardoned.

446
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:01,759
I'm the main perpetrator!

447
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,820
Joo Ah Ran isn't guilty.

448
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,984
<i>Prison,</i>

449
00:33:06,104 --> 00:33:07,768
<i>or the detention center,</i>

450
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,477
please just lock me up.

451
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:11,811
There was Joo Ah Ran's face
in the black box,

452
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:13,971
what are you talking about?

453
00:33:14,628 --> 00:33:16,130
It's not true.

454
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,877
Joo Ah Ran,

455
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,017
is only my helper.

456
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,797
I hate Shin Hyun Woo,

457
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,938
and told her to kill him.

458
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:28,938
<i>That woman was just persuaded by me,</i>

459
00:33:29,058 --> 00:33:30,985
I'm the real murderer!

460
00:33:37,664 --> 00:33:39,298
What?!

461
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,514
Who wants to marry who?

462
00:33:41,634 --> 00:33:43,625
Father's health isn't good,

463
00:33:43,745 --> 00:33:46,103
and I know I shouldn't be saying this,

464
00:33:46,223 --> 00:33:47,587
but, I want to hold a simple
wedding ceremony,

465
00:33:47,707 --> 00:33:49,972
with just our family.

466
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:53,376
Please agree to it.

467
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:01,207
Are you just informing us,

468
00:34:01,327 --> 00:34:03,846
after you've set the wedding date?

469
00:34:04,146 --> 00:34:06,681
Oppa, are you crazy?

470
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:07,977
Hyun Min.

471
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,818
How can you surprise your father like that?

472
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:11,950
Let's talk about this another time.

473
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,184
What's there to talk about another time?

474
00:34:14,304 --> 00:34:16,109
You personally saw how your Hyung
went to hell for a woman,

475
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:17,874
how can you make decisions like these?

476
00:34:17,994 --> 00:34:21,649
<i>How can my children have such
taste when it comes to women?</i>

477
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:24,166
If we look at it in perspective,

478
00:34:24,286 --> 00:34:27,384
there's nothing wrong with Yeon Jae at all.

479
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:29,206
<i>But, if you use your heart to look at her,</i>

480
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:31,516
she's actually a really good person.

481
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:34,501
Our family needs to have
someone like Yeon Jae.

482
00:34:35,061 --> 00:34:37,333
Please believe me,
and accept Yeon Jae.

483
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,925
Hyung and I,

484
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,868
is it so hard to come to terms?

485
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:47,467
Where did we go wrong?

486
00:34:48,988 --> 00:34:51,730
The one mother that gave birth to us,

487
00:34:52,782 --> 00:34:55,918
doesn't know why we came
to such a hateful point.

488
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,265
Today's tragedy,

489
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:03,833
is a punishment for my past.

490
00:35:04,587 --> 00:35:06,652
That's right.

491
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:11,181
I've always been thinking,

492
00:35:11,594 --> 00:35:14,580
that taking revenge on Joo Ah Ran
was the only way to recover my life.

493
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,228
Because of that misguided thought,

494
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:21,639
I've split up my entire family.

495
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,982
I've been hurt,

496
00:35:25,102 --> 00:35:26,729
by my own knife.

497
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:29,447
What's the use in saying such things?

498
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:32,283
We have to protect Ah Ran first.

499
00:35:32,696 --> 00:35:35,325
Even if I sell my soul to the dark side,

500
00:35:35,445 --> 00:35:38,236
I can't watch Ah Ran suffer anymore.

501
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,944
Let's go visit the victim's family first.

502
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:44,385
Regarding Ah Ran's crimes,

503
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:47,015
Mother has also agreed to write a letter.

504
00:35:47,135 --> 00:35:48,817
If Mum's crimes are exposed,

505
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:51,268
it would be beneficial to Ah Ran as well.

506
00:35:51,388 --> 00:35:53,709
I'll try my best to delay the police.

507
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,183
Is this Kyeong Ran?

508
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:17,967
Unni, you're fine, right?

509
00:36:18,087 --> 00:36:19,882
I really want to go see you, Unni,

510
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:23,208
but I'm afraid of being followed,
so I can't go.

511
00:36:23,328 --> 00:36:25,893
You've eaten, right?

512
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:27,095
I have.

513
00:36:27,215 --> 00:36:29,142
I'm fine.

514
00:36:29,262 --> 00:36:30,475
Don't worry.

515
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:32,779
I've heard of the community
center at Gangwondo.

516
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,732
I've been there once,

517
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:36,967
if you go there, you'll be safe.

518
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,070
Hyun Woo, and Director Nam,

519
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,915
are also working really hard for Unni.

520
00:36:42,035 --> 00:36:46,141
<i>The victim's family has also
agreed to write a letter,</i>

521
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:47,944
<i>everything will be fine.</i>

522
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:51,608
Right now,

523
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:54,801
you've been living for our deceased parents.

524
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,655
Right now, Unni, you have
to live for yourself.

525
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:01,676
If that's the case, you have to forget
the past and forgive everything.

526
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:03,854
If you don't forgive,

527
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,939
Unni will come into misfortune.

528
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,098
<i>You know what I'm saying, right?</i>

529
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,591
Kyeong Ran.

530
00:37:11,587 --> 00:37:14,009
I want to ask you something.

531
00:37:16,657 --> 00:37:18,422
Till now,

532
00:37:19,815 --> 00:37:22,219
you still love Hyun Woo, right?

533
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,764
It might need some time,

534
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:29,074
but I'll take care of it.

535
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:31,979
If I had to choose someone,

536
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,176
between Unni and Hyun Woo,

537
00:37:35,622 --> 00:37:37,669
my answer is,

538
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,509
Unni.

539
00:37:43,476 --> 00:37:45,542
I have to hang up.

540
00:37:45,662 --> 00:37:48,246
The director is waiting for me.

541
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,687
Goodnight.

542
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:59,567
My sister.

543
00:38:04,931 --> 00:38:07,015
How embarrassing,

544
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,339
and how much she must hate me.

545
00:38:12,921 --> 00:38:15,569
Thank you for calling me Unni.

546
00:38:17,653 --> 00:38:20,583
I really really wanted to hear that.

547
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,958
Appearing in this disgraceful way,
I'm really sorry.

548
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:36,522
Unni.

549
00:38:39,564 --> 00:38:41,104
Unni.

550
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,222
Unni.

551
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:57,414
So?

552
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:00,607
Must you hold the wedding today?

553
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:03,048
I'm sorry.

554
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,269
But,

555
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,538
I want to keep my promise,

556
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:08,528
to my wedding.

557
00:39:08,648 --> 00:39:10,538
<i>Even if no one comes to my wedding,</i>

558
00:39:10,658 --> 00:39:12,848
I have to hold it.

559
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,873
I will prove it to you for
the rest of my life.

560
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,084
Hyun Min,

561
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:20,704
Hyun Min!

562
00:39:20,824 --> 00:39:22,939
Why is this fellow so worrisome too?

563
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:24,685
Has he gone crazy with the idea of marriage?

564
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:25,816
Honey,

565
00:39:25,936 --> 00:39:29,290
just give in to Hyun Min this once.

566
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:32,126
I don't want Hyun Min to get hurt,

567
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:36,238
and to live with the woman he loves.

568
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:38,567
<i>As parents, we shouldn't expect anything,</i>

569
00:39:38,687 --> 00:39:41,171
<i>but to think of Hyun Min.</i>

570
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:51,438
Are you going out?

571
00:39:51,558 --> 00:39:53,109
I'm going to Seoul.

572
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:56,164
The police are looking for you,
will you be fine?

573
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:00,784
You know that you're going to the community
center today, right?

574
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:02,417
Yes.

575
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:04,849
Before that, I have something I need to do.

576
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,403
It won't be too long.

577
00:40:27,774 --> 00:40:29,389
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:31,286
I can't give you a proper wedding,

579
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:34,145
so we can only come to the photo studio.

580
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,249
But to repay you for the lack
of a wedding ceremony,

581
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,028
I'll definitely let you put on
a beautiful wedding dress.

582
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:41,037
So what?

583
00:40:41,604 --> 00:40:45,754
More than that, I feel uneasy that
we're letting down your family.

584
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:48,514
How hurt they have to be right now.

585
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,355
I'm a bad woman.

586
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,724
Suffer a little on the wedding day,

587
00:40:53,844 --> 00:40:56,898
but it's alright if you make
them happy in the future.

588
00:40:57,018 --> 00:40:58,550
I'll do well.

589
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,259
Be strong.

590
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:04,309
Here, look here!

591
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:06,150
Look a little closer.

592
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,023
Here... One, two...

593
00:41:11,617 --> 00:41:13,344
Dad!

594
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,016
You came?

595
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,497
Father, thank you!

596
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:23,563
Let go of me.

597
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:26,173
I didn't come to see you get married.

598
00:41:26,293 --> 00:41:29,459
Your mother insisted on coming
to take a family photo,

599
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:31,884
so we came to take a photo.

600
00:41:32,004 --> 00:41:33,799
Then, let's hurry and take a photo.

601
00:41:33,919 --> 00:41:36,335
Mother, and Brother-in-law, come over.

602
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:38,288
Ahgassi too.

603
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,434
- Here...
- Father, you have to smile!

604
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:44,382
Ahgassi too!

605
00:41:46,262 --> 00:41:48,929
<i>Alright, look here.</i>

606
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,290
<i>Let's take another one</i>

607
00:42:00,677 --> 00:42:01,973
What is this?

608
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:04,377
Is this a wedding car?

609
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:08,003
The preparations were a little rushed,
so we couldn't prepare anything.

610
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:10,614
Here's a card for four days and
three nights in a hotel,

611
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,266
have fun.

612
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:14,032
Hurry and leave,

613
00:42:14,152 --> 00:42:16,952
do you want to spend the night here?

614
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,786
Honey,

615
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:41,870
I'll go out for a while,

616
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,420
to make preparations for
Hyun Min's wedding room.

617
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,504
I want to go out and catch a breath too.

618
00:42:45,624 --> 00:42:47,852
What breath?

619
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:51,266
You've only taken care of the old man for
a couple of days, you're tired already?

620
00:42:51,386 --> 00:42:54,365
She might feel a little empty
because of Hyun Min's wedding,

621
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,036
Hyun Ji and I are here too,

622
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,989
let Mother go.

623
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:00,525
It's cold out,
so you should take my car.

624
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:03,946
Don't catch a cold just because
you have to take the bus.

625
00:43:04,066 --> 00:43:05,937
Thank you.

626
00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:50,314
Yes, this is Pyeong Chang Dong.

627
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:54,071
What?!

628
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:05,689
It's me.

629
00:45:05,809 --> 00:45:07,887
I was about to call.

630
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:10,282
The police station just called.

631
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,329
They've just received the letter,

632
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:14,789
so on the whole, they're
going to handle it lightly.

633
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:17,305
Ah Ran, you can come back now.

634
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,142
Mother.

635
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:56,443
Mum.

636
00:45:57,044 --> 00:45:59,372
Why is your hand so cold?

637
00:46:00,828 --> 00:46:02,574
What in the world,

638
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:06,574
how long were you out in the cold?

639
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:14,149
Hyun Ji,

640
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:17,773
quickly get a blanket.

641
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:21,304
Mum is really cold, hurry!

642
00:46:30,709 --> 00:46:33,695
Even if you die,
I can't forgive you either.

643
00:46:35,744 --> 00:46:39,256
You might as well just take me with you.

644
00:46:41,153 --> 00:46:43,744
Let's go together!

645
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:00,606
<i>Mother.</i>

646
00:47:00,726 --> 00:47:02,502
<i>Mum, mum.</i>

647
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:06,690
<i>Mum.</i>

648
00:47:07,113 --> 00:47:09,273
<i>Mum, mum</i>

649
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,338
<i>Mum!</i>

650
00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:49,381
No.

651
00:47:57,543 --> 00:47:59,045
No.

652
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,173
Stop.

653
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,901
Don't go.

654
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:24,704
Don't go!

655
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:28,967
From now on,

656
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,487
I won't do anything.

657
00:48:36,529 --> 00:48:38,820
Just stay by my side.

658
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:46,688
I still have a lot to tell you.

659
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,005
Thank you for giving birth to me,

660
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,451
I'm sorry I kept hating you.

661
00:49:02,744 --> 00:49:06,050
I still have a lot to tell you.

662
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,604
Why did you just leave like that?!

663
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:27,641
<i>I wanted to call you Mother too.</i>

664
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:40,703
I'm sorry, Mother.

665
00:49:46,403 --> 00:49:49,483
We've just begun the investigation
on Jo Kyung Hee.

666
00:49:49,603 --> 00:49:51,868
The accident happened because
of the problem with the brake.

667
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:54,234
A problem with the brake?

668
00:49:54,978 --> 00:49:56,349
That can't be.

669
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:58,790
At the workshop last week,
everything was fine,

670
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:00,386
how could there suddenly be a problem?

671
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:02,095
According to the experts,

672
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:05,964
someone intentionally tampered
with the brakes.

673
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,581
Is there someone you can think of?

674
00:50:08,701 --> 00:50:10,140
That's right.

675
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,886
Joo Ah Ran!

676
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:14,064
A person who has ill intentions
to our family,

677
00:50:14,184 --> 00:50:15,382
there's only that person!

678
00:50:15,502 --> 00:50:18,030
Don't say anything you don't have proof of.

679
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:19,532
<i>Oh, right.</i>

680
00:50:19,652 --> 00:50:22,090
I saw Ah Ran behind the potted plants,

681
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,701
she was hiding in a corner staring at us.

682
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,466
<i>Then,</i>

683
00:50:26,586 --> 00:50:28,776
<i>Joo Ah Ran, like your mother,</i>

684
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:31,311
<i>tampered with the brakes?</i>

685
00:50:31,431 --> 00:50:32,318
Could it be?

686
00:50:32,438 --> 00:50:34,478
<i>Go find out where Joo Ah Ran is...</i>

687
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,187
No.

688
00:50:37,783 --> 00:50:40,093
Ah Ran couldn't have done that.

689
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:51,944
Where I'm going,

690
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:54,154
don't tell anyone at all.

691
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:05,342
I don't think I need this
hand phone anymore.

692
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:08,572
Take care of your health,
and live well.

693
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:11,558
If there's any difficulty,
please contact me.

694
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,997
It's me.

695
00:51:16,117 --> 00:51:18,344
I'm going to pick your Unni up.

696
00:51:18,464 --> 00:51:20,597
Where is your Unni?

697
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:23,959
Alright, I get it.

698
00:51:25,171 --> 00:51:27,030
Joo Ah Ran,

699
00:51:27,725 --> 00:51:30,222
did you have to go to the extreme?

700
00:51:30,342 --> 00:51:33,114
No matter what, she's my mother.

701
00:51:33,234 --> 00:51:35,686
If you loved me at all,

702
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,540
you'd have held back just a little.

703
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:52,410
Joo Ah Ran!

704
00:52:54,645 --> 00:52:56,372
Joo Seung.

705
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,417
Did you really...

706
00:53:14,018 --> 00:53:15,539
do it?

707
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:23,176
Don't come over!

708
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,331
Don't take another step.

709
00:53:27,759 --> 00:53:29,524
Why did you do it?

710
00:53:30,142 --> 00:53:32,903
Everything was getting better,
why did you have to do it?!

711
00:53:34,668 --> 00:53:37,241
If you loved me at all,
you would have held back.

712
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,907
Was the love I gave you,

713
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,205
that insufficient?

714
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:45,529
Stand there!

715
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:49,454
If you come over, I'll die.

716
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:56,841
That's impossible.

717
00:53:57,554 --> 00:53:59,244
How could you...

718
00:53:59,364 --> 00:54:01,047
my mother...

719
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:07,970
Joo Ah Ran!

720
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:11,923
Stand there!

721
00:54:15,059 --> 00:54:16,806
Joo Ah Ran!

722
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:19,708
Stay there!

723
00:54:19,828 --> 00:54:21,097
Joo Ah Ran!

724
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,731
Stay there!

725
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,008
Joo Ah Ran!

726
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:25,567
Stay there!

727
00:54:25,687 --> 00:54:28,553
Stay there!

728
00:54:28,942 --> 00:54:31,627
Stay, there, Joo Ah Ran!

729
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,801
Joo Ah Ran, stay there!

730
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,036
Stay there!

731
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:07,990
Don't come over.

732
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:09,906
Don't come over!

733
00:55:12,632 --> 00:55:14,041
Joo Ah Ran.

734
00:55:14,161 --> 00:55:16,595
It's no use running away.

735
00:55:16,715 --> 00:55:18,642
Turn yourself in now.

736
00:55:19,374 --> 00:55:21,477
That's right, let me go.

737
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,793
I've never asked for anything,

738
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:27,178
till the day I die,

739
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:29,713
can't I hide here, just to live here?

740
00:55:29,833 --> 00:55:33,065
Repent for all the crimes you've done first.

741
00:55:33,185 --> 00:55:36,220
Here, come here.

742
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,704
I don't want to.

743
00:55:37,824 --> 00:55:39,638
I won't go to prison.

744
00:55:40,092 --> 00:55:42,721
Thinking about how I lived
brings me to tears.

745
00:55:43,454 --> 00:55:46,515
Do you still want me to waste
my life in prison?

746
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:50,834
Now, I want to live like a person.

747
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:53,791
Like our Kyeong Ran said,

748
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:56,345
the rest of my life is for me.

749
00:55:56,465 --> 00:55:59,519
I want to do the things that I wish to do,
and to live thinking about myself.

750
00:56:42,823 --> 00:56:44,945
<i>Don't feel sorry.</i>

751
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:48,119
<i>Right now,</i>

752
00:56:48,851 --> 00:56:51,368
<i>I'm really really peaceful.</i>

753
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:56,538
<i>During this period of time,</i>

754
00:56:57,364 --> 00:57:00,049
<i>I've been really tired,</i>

755
00:57:03,902 --> 00:57:06,212
<i>I want to rest now.</i>

756
00:57:06,332 --> 00:57:08,991
<i>I met, the person I really
wanted to see, Kyeong Ran,</i>

757
00:57:09,895 --> 00:57:12,637
<i>and I undid the knots in my heart.</i>

758
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:16,732
<i>Now, there's nothing left to hold on to.</i>

759
00:57:19,718 --> 00:57:21,689
<i>Mum, Dad,</i>

760
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:25,734
<i>you must be really happy to see me, right?</i>

761
00:57:29,133 --> 00:57:30,710
<i>At this moment,</i>

762
00:57:32,402 --> 00:57:36,928
<i>I suddenly really want to see Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

763
00:57:39,576 --> 00:57:41,830
<i>The man I really loved,</i>

764
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:45,788
<i>should be Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

765
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:51,947
<i>I've never told him this.</i>

766
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:55,950
<i>Please tell him,</i>

767
00:57:56,832 --> 00:57:58,541
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

768
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,203
<i>Also,</i>

769
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:07,371
<i>if you find anything useful in my body,</i>

770
00:58:08,611 --> 00:58:12,047
<i>give it to someone who needs help.</i>

771
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:24,158
<i>The main suspect in the murder of
Madam Jo at Pyeong Chang Do,</i>

772
00:58:24,278 --> 00:58:27,636
<i>Ms. Joo's body, has been found
by someone this early morning.</i>

773
00:58:27,756 --> 00:58:30,998
<i>The police suspect that
the main suspect, Ms. Joo,</i>

774
00:58:31,118 --> 00:58:33,552
<i>had a personal grudge against Madam Jo,</i>

775
00:58:33,672 --> 00:58:37,261
<i>and tampered with the brake on
Madam Jo's car, killing Madam Jo.</i>

776
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:58,501
<i>[Deceased: Joo Ah Ran]</i>

777
00:59:02,332 --> 00:59:04,604
I can't understand.

778
00:59:05,992 --> 00:59:07,963
How Unni,

779
00:59:09,071 --> 00:59:11,757
would do something like that to Madam.

780
00:59:13,297 --> 00:59:15,475
Stop thinking about it.

781
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:16,932
Be it Mum,

782
00:59:17,052 --> 00:59:18,679
or Ah Ran,

783
00:59:19,224 --> 00:59:21,702
they've gone to somewhere peaceful.

784
00:59:22,435 --> 00:59:23,993
At that place,

785
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:25,989
both of them are innocent.

786
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:28,468
She told Director that
at the community center,

787
00:59:28,588 --> 00:59:33,062
she wanted to live out her life,

788
00:59:33,182 --> 00:59:35,830
as a volunteer.

789
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:39,016
Then, I don't understand,

790
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:42,603
why Unni would do something like that.

791
00:59:43,485 --> 00:59:46,490
Since she already made such a decision,

792
00:59:46,610 --> 00:59:49,941
why could she not forgive
Madam till the end,

793
00:59:51,783 --> 00:59:56,891
and live diligently till the end.

794
00:59:57,855 --> 01:00:00,427
If I knew this was going to happen,

795
01:00:00,547 --> 01:00:05,216
I should have let Ah Ran and Joo Seung
leave at the beginning.

796
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:08,778
Why was I,

797
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,426
so insistent on my revenge?

798
01:00:12,462 --> 01:00:14,228
Unni.

799
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:16,124
Go well.

800
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:21,467
In our next lives,

801
01:00:22,275 --> 01:00:24,622
be my Unni again.

802
01:00:25,996 --> 01:00:28,043
Then...

803
01:00:29,658 --> 01:00:31,742
let's not separate,

804
01:00:33,057 --> 01:00:35,179
and not hate each other,

805
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:39,980
and not fight.

806
01:01:03,568 --> 01:01:05,108
<i>Ah Ran,</i>

807
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:09,430
<i>didn't want me to tell you
for the time being.</i>

808
01:01:18,632 --> 01:01:20,548
The death report.

809
01:01:21,564 --> 01:01:25,320
Why would Unni file a death
report for Joo Kyeong Ran?

810
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,564
She wanted you to live under
the name of Yun Jae Hee in the future.

811
01:01:31,407 --> 01:01:33,210
So in that case, there would
be no problem if you wanted

812
01:01:35,032 --> 01:01:37,248
to marry Teacher Shin.

813
01:01:59,021 --> 01:02:00,242
What?

814
01:02:00,362 --> 01:02:02,007
What does that mean?

815
01:02:02,127 --> 01:02:04,589
Mother asked to look at the brake?

816
01:02:04,709 --> 01:02:08,815
She came to our auto club,
and asked to take apart the brake.

817
01:02:09,212 --> 01:02:13,456
Then, everything was fine,
and the accident happened.

818
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,785
Could it be...

819
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,936
<i>Joo Seung.</i>

820
01:02:45,056 --> 01:02:49,349
<i>Every year when I received
a birthday present from you,</i>

821
01:02:49,469 --> 01:02:53,753
<i>I shamelessly anticipated it, and was happy.</i>

822
01:02:55,124 --> 01:02:58,316
<i>There wasn't one I didn't like.</i>

823
01:02:59,137 --> 01:03:01,034
<i>The pearl necklace you sent me,</i>

824
01:03:01,154 --> 01:03:02,912
<i>the scarf,</i>

825
01:03:03,032 --> 01:03:04,978
<i>the blouse.</i>

826
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:08,921
<i>They were all so precious,
thank you very much.</i>

827
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,890
<i>All the crimes I committed,</i>

828
01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:15,406
<i>I'll take them away.</i>

829
01:03:16,683 --> 01:03:21,635
<i>Forgive, the Mum that only left you pain.</i>

830
01:03:23,682 --> 01:03:26,818
<i>But in this last moment before I leave,</i>

831
01:03:28,114 --> 01:03:31,232
<i>I've never regretted giving birth to you.</i>

832
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:34,236
<i>Father, Hyung and younger brother,</i>

833
01:03:35,043 --> 01:03:38,799
<i>are the last presents I leave for you.</i>

834
01:03:49,072 --> 01:03:50,556
Then,

835
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,715
Mum...

836
01:03:56,879 --> 01:03:58,175
She...

837
01:04:04,483 --> 01:04:05,986
Ah Ran...

838
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,164
Ah Ran...

839
01:04:51,327 --> 01:04:57,130
<i>1 year later</i>

840
01:05:12,195 --> 01:05:13,866
Unni.

841
01:05:14,936 --> 01:05:16,889
Have you been well?

842
01:05:17,453 --> 01:05:19,594
You haven't been cold, right?

843
01:05:20,476 --> 01:05:22,486
I know you miss me,

844
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:25,295
so I brought a photograph.

845
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:43,599
It's been a while.

846
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:45,684
Have you been well?

847
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:48,050
Yes, Ahjussi.

848
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:49,552
No,

849
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:52,106
what about you, President?

850
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:55,409
I've been really busy, I have no energy.

851
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:59,409
Occasionally, I see the news in the papers,

852
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:02,113
congratulations on your big expansion in SM.

853
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:06,593
Madam, today is her death
anniversary, right?

854
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:07,983
Yes.

855
01:06:10,163 --> 01:06:12,680
You don't know the news
about Joo Seung, right?

856
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,910
He seems like he's still travelling around.

857
01:06:17,377 --> 01:06:21,340
Once in a while, he sends a postcard
so I won't forget him.

858
01:06:22,035 --> 01:06:24,964
I told him he had to come home
for Mum's death anniversary,

859
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:26,467
I don't know.

860
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:33,072
Losing the two people he loved
the most in one day,

861
01:06:34,124 --> 01:06:37,335
that pain, won't disappear so easily.

862
01:06:38,283 --> 01:06:39,597
Right.

863
01:06:39,717 --> 01:06:42,583
I applied for the name,

864
01:06:42,703 --> 01:06:44,405
Joo Kyeong Ran.

865
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:48,161
Is that so?

866
01:06:49,364 --> 01:06:50,829
Good job.

867
01:06:55,899 --> 01:06:57,796
Then, I'm going to leave.

868
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,815
Director is sick.

869
01:06:59,935 --> 01:07:02,951
I have to cook for the children.

870
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:46,191
<i>Like a snowflake floating towards you,</i>

871
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:48,313
<i>don't hesitate, don't stop.</i>

872
01:08:48,433 --> 01:08:49,891
<i>Don't hide.</i>

873
01:08:50,011 --> 01:08:52,042
<i>I want to float into your arms,</i>

874
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:55,448
<i>and become part of a snowdrift,
an everlasting snowdrift.</i>

875
01:08:57,946 --> 01:08:59,486
<i>There,</i>

876
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,417
<i>are the two people I occasionally protect,</i>

877
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,286
<i>One is my wife.</i>

878
01:09:07,887 --> 01:09:10,441
<i>One is my mother's son.</i>

879
01:09:11,892 --> 01:09:14,145
<i>One person is dead,</i>

880
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,112
<i>one person is tragic.</i>

881
01:09:19,065 --> 01:09:22,652
<i>But why am I not happy right now?</i>

882
01:09:24,572 --> 01:09:27,989
<i>If I had handed the crimes
of those two people to God,</i>

883
01:09:28,722 --> 01:09:31,050
<i>would our lives be different?</i>

884
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,407
<i>Joo Ah Ran,</i>

885
01:09:34,527 --> 01:09:36,153
<i>you've won.</i>

886
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:41,486
<i>Because, the last person who cut
off the tail of your revenge was me.</i>

887
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,450
<i>My mother's crimes,</i>

888
01:09:46,032 --> 01:09:48,680
<i>for forgiving them before you left,</i>

889
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,689
<i>thank you.</i>

Temptation Of An Angel 

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,007
Episode 18

3
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:12,877
Jae Sung, we've fallen into a trap.

4
00:00:12,997 --> 00:00:15,464
Everybody is maligning me!

5
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,966
<i>I told you clearly.</i>

6
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,169
Shin Hyun Woo died
in a gas explosion.

7
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:22,183
I wasn't there then!

8
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:24,643
I had nothing to do with
the traffic accident either.

9
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:26,063
What...

10
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:27,929
if I don't believe you?

11
00:00:28,049 --> 00:00:29,974
You have to believe me.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,275
We don't need the wedding ceremony.

13
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:36,737
Let's leave!

14
00:00:36,857 --> 00:00:38,688
Let's go.

15
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:41,380
You took someone's life!

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,868
Do you want to just run away like that?

17
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,576
<i>You actually thought
you can stand here, blissful.</i>

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,608
How shameless and hateful.

19
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,419
I must...

20
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:58,127
make the crimes that you committed,
crawl out of your mouth like worms.

21
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,905
Till the day you die.

22
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:03,958
You have to pay for
your crimes till you die.

23
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:06,841
Who are you?

24
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,757
Do you still not know?

25
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:14,633
The Romeo who lost his heart,

26
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:17,050
the person you killed,

27
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:19,397
your husband,
Shin Hyun Woo.

28
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,560
That's right.

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,913
This person here, is Shin Hyun Woo.

30
00:01:34,033 --> 00:01:36,817
He underwent plastic surgery
because of serious burn injuries.

31
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:39,078
But, he is definitely Shin Hyun Woo.

32
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,261
I'm the witness.

33
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,922
Now, you know?

34
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,454
The Ahn Jae Sung you loved,

35
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:53,274
is the Shin Hyun Woo you killed.

36
00:01:53,888 --> 00:01:57,090
The Ahn Jae Sung who was going to save you,

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,380
didn't exist right from the beginning,

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,321
only the Shin Hyun Woo
who was stabbing you in the back.

39
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,463
No.

40
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,604
No.

41
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,125
You're not Shin Hyun Woo.

42
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,284
You're Ahn Jae Sung.

43
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,888
Tell me.

44
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:23,702
You're the Ahn Jae Sung I loved, tell me!

45
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:27,242
Wake up and face reality!

46
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,738
I wanted you to feel it in your bones,

47
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:39,470
the feeling that living
is more painful than dying.

48
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,260
If the law can't do it...

49
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,876
I'll do it.

50
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,994
Is that so?

51
00:02:57,775 --> 00:03:00,319
To take revenge on me,

52
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:04,586
with your body full of stab wounds,
you became another person.

53
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:08,741
You hated me to the point where your face,

54
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:14,164
your blood and heart
had to be replaced.

55
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:18,044
Or,

56
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,096
did you love me that much?

57
00:03:22,216 --> 00:03:24,279
Shut your mouth!

58
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,151
The moment when I return to Shin Hyun Woo,

59
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:32,122
it's over.

60
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,723
There are a lot of reporters
outside the house.

61
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:38,949
<i>Outside this hotel,</i>

62
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,214
<i>there are police officers
waiting to shoot you.</i>

63
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,380
Just as long as I say one word,

64
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,288
tomorrow,

65
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:50,108
it'll be all over the news.

66
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:52,313
<i>Your life,</i>

67
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,647
<i>will be unsalvageable.</i>

68
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,658
I'll give you one last chance to repent.

69
00:04:00,057 --> 00:04:03,195
Now, you walk out by yourself,

70
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:06,882
spill out everything,
and confess to the police.

71
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:11,822
Confess your own crimes with your own mouth.

72
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,869
That would reduce half of your sins.

73
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,534
Make your own choice.

74
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,205
You're really cruel.

75
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:31,318
Will you only be happy and give up, after
you've pushed me into a bottomless pit?

76
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:35,347
All right.

77
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,426
If that's what you want,

78
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,055
I'll do as you wish.

79
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:48,553
Then, how content you'll become,

80
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:53,854
I want to see it with my own eyes.

81
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:19,688
What big news could there be?

82
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:21,617
Making us wait like that?

83
00:05:21,737 --> 00:05:23,907
All right, let's just wait it out.

84
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:27,236
It seems like something
interesting is happening in there.

85
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,961
Father.

86
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,314
Mother.

87
00:05:38,226 --> 00:05:39,858
You...

88
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,191
No, you...

89
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,102
Really are Hyun Woo?

90
00:05:46,222 --> 00:05:49,039
My son, Hyun Woo, am I right?

91
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,647
Yes, that's right.

92
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,793
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:54,913 --> 00:05:57,566
This time, I've been pretending not to know.

94
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:01,111
Please forgive me,
I could only do this.

95
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:03,104
You horrible fellow.

96
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,047
Are you an orphan?

97
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,225
When were you going to leave your
dad out of the loop, before you told me?

98
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:14,045
Was I that untrustworthy?

99
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:15,456
Hyun Woo.

100
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:19,887
It's our Hyun Woo.

101
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,986
This gaze,

102
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:24,975
this smell,

103
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:27,435
<i>it's our Hyun Woo, that's right.</i>

104
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:29,174
My son!

105
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,796
Mother.

106
00:06:34,357 --> 00:06:35,735
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,792
I came back in this manner.

108
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,272
<i>I missed you this much,</i>

109
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:43,792
I thought about coming
back a few times a day,

110
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,985
but I couldn't return weakly,
without having done anything.

111
00:06:51,932 --> 00:06:55,240
Then, you should also
tell Mother that you're alive.

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,504
Did you know that Mom's heart
was on fire, why did you do that?

113
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,130
Why did you have to bear it
by yourself, like a fool?

114
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:14,133
What should we do?

115
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,659
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

116
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:17,874
No, I can't.

117
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,694
The guilty person isn't me,
it's Shin Woo Sub.

118
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:23,429
That person is still alive and free.

119
00:07:23,549 --> 00:07:26,312
<i>He can't pin all the crimes on me.</i>

120
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,329
That Shin Hyun Woo that looks so righteous,

121
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,682
that dirty blood is also
flowing through his body.

122
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,887
But we can't get away now.

123
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:38,046
From the front, and the back,
they're all watching us.

124
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,472
Leave it to me.

125
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,797
All right, brother-in-law,

126
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,641
since this is the case,

127
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,778
I'll go see the police
and tell them everything.

128
00:07:54,796 --> 00:07:57,001
But, let me change before that.

129
00:07:57,573 --> 00:08:00,562
I can't let the police interrogate
me when I'm in this state.

130
00:08:00,682 --> 00:08:02,834
You should accede to that request, right?

131
00:08:02,954 --> 00:08:06,120
You can see the police
are oustide everywhere, right?

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,894
Don't even dream about playing tricks.

133
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,438
You can't run anywhere.

134
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:34,315
No matter what, we have to escape from here.

135
00:08:34,435 --> 00:08:38,449
As long as we get on a plane to America,
Shin Hyun Woo can't do anything about it.

136
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:39,806
What time is the plane?

137
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:40,972
7.

138
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,844
We can handle all the procedures
as long as we leave right now.

139
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:44,967
All right.

140
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:46,897
Looking at the situation,
I'll leave with you.

141
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:50,741
Change your clothes first, I'll go see
if there's a door that leads out from here.

142
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:07,558
That's right.

143
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:09,784
I'll avoid this storm first.

144
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:14,701
Now, if the police looks into everything,
things will look bad for me.

145
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:18,178
To look for the sister I
haven't seen in 25 years,

146
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:21,028
I can't go to jail.

147
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,417
- Who are you?
- Get my handbag here now.

148
00:09:25,537 --> 00:09:27,240
- What?
- Now!

149
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:28,491
Ah, yes.

150
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:37,092
It's me.

151
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,514
Have you found a way out?

152
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:44,263
All right. I'll go there right now.

153
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,465
Is Joo Ah Ran still in there?

154
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,331
She just left.

155
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:26,624
What?

156
00:10:32,858 --> 00:10:34,024
Stand there!

157
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:43,932
Joo Ah Ran!

158
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:53,490
If you take this, you will see an exit.

159
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,437
Get out from there, and take
the car to Angel Orphanage.

160
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:58,048
And go straight to the airport.

161
00:10:58,168 --> 00:10:59,723
What about you, Joo Seung?

162
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,331
I don't think I can leave with you.

163
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:04,366
You leave first.

164
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:08,091
No matter what,
you can never get caught.

165
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:09,702
Understand?

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,182
Joo Ah Ran! Stay there,
hurry and come out!

167
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,323
I'm going to grit my teeth.

168
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,590
Today, no matter if you're my Hyung,

169
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,540
because of my brother,

170
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,554
I'm not going to let you off!

171
00:12:46,902 --> 00:12:48,598
You can't go.

172
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,914
You can't go.

173
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,841
You can't go!

174
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:40,194
What's going on?
My passport, my air ticket!

175
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:42,950
I clearly left it here.

176
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:55,629
Are you looking for this?

177
00:13:55,926 --> 00:13:57,516
What are you doing?

178
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,085
Give it to me.

179
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:02,141
Where are you running away to like a coward?

180
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:05,630
Your crimes cannot even be counted,
you don't even have a sense of shame,

181
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,434
and you want to run away to
a different country to live freely?

182
00:14:08,554 --> 00:14:09,524
That,

183
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:12,647
even I, who was beside Shin Hyun Woo
watching him suffer, cannot forgive.

184
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,767
Stay out of it.

185
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,354
Are you Shin Hyun Woo's wife?

186
00:14:17,474 --> 00:14:19,919
This is something that Shin Hyun Woo,
his family and I have to settle.

187
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,255
Third parties should stay out of it!

188
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,184
Then you should settle
everything before you leave.

189
00:14:23,304 --> 00:14:26,571
Stop pretending to be someone
else so cheaply and running away,

190
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,946
it doesn't seem like Joo Ah Ran.

191
00:14:33,144 --> 00:14:36,133
No! No!

192
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:41,518
What are you to, involve yourself
in someone else's business?!

193
00:14:41,638 --> 00:14:44,449
Don't touch my woman!

194
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,294
What?

195
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:48,977
Your woman?

196
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,949
Listen clearly.

197
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:54,171
Yoon Jae Hee,
is a woman I love.

198
00:14:55,041 --> 00:15:00,948
As much as you toy with my life,
I won't allow you to touch my woman.

199
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:06,269
Don't use those cruel hands
of yours to touch a hair of my woman's.

200
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,598
I'm not that Shin Hyun Woo
you played around with.

201
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:12,948
Joo Ah Ran!

202
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,828
Let's take a trip to the police station.

203
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:19,836
We'll have a joint interrogation
with Shin Hyun Woo.

204
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:21,193
No.

205
00:15:22,571 --> 00:15:26,430
If you turned yourself in,
I was going to leave you a way out.

206
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,931
But you kept walking
towards the gates of hell.

207
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,331
I had no other choice.

208
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,189
If you wish, I'll walk with you.

209
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:36,030
Take her away please.

210
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:43,503
Let me go.
Let me go!

211
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:48,782
Ahjusshi, I have to go back to the hotel.

212
00:15:48,902 --> 00:15:52,503
I've made an appointment with my Unnie,
and the time has passed.

213
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:54,242
All right. Go.

214
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:55,620
After you meet your Unnie, give me a call.

215
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,956
All right.

216
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,737
Hyung, turn him over to the police too.

217
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:12,202
<i>He's the same person.</i>

218
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:15,509
<i>There's no reason to think about it anymore.</i>

219
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,892
Do you really have to do this?

220
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,242
She was the one who abandoned
me and put on a wedding dress.

221
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:27,578
But,

222
00:16:27,698 --> 00:16:30,631
do you really have to get
the police to waste her like that?

223
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,656
Even though you and
Joo Ah Ran failed at killing me,

224
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,666
I have no intention of
giving in to you at all.

225
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,449
<i>Although you wanted to
leave the country and hide,</i>

226
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,608
there is no place for you to
run and hide anymore!

227
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,304
All right.

228
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:49,187
We will be punished.

229
00:16:49,502 --> 00:16:53,191
But, give us some time to cool down,

230
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:55,905
<i>And, for this woman who loved you,</i>

231
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:58,301
and had your baby,
is that too much to ask?

232
00:16:58,421 --> 00:16:59,743
<i>No!</i>

233
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:02,175
Now, drag them away right
now and convict them!

234
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,783
There's no reason to
drag it out any further.

235
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,203
<i>Get in the car.</i>

236
00:17:07,857 --> 00:17:09,087
Hold on.

237
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:14,639
The other party wants to
savor her pain slowly.

238
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:20,788
Then, letting them get what they want,
is not a big deal.

239
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,491
I'll see them tomorrow
at the police station.

240
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:36,935
Ah.

241
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,327
What is this?

242
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:44,173
Today is our Ah Ran's wedding.

243
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,714
Aigoo, she didn't call us,
what wedding could it be?

244
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,452
Isn't it written here?

245
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,700
Groom, Ahn Jae Sung,
Bride Joo Ah Ran.

246
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,342
Oh my.

247
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:56,819
Looks like the important thing she
was talking about was her wedding.

248
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,388
What a shameless creature.

249
00:17:58,508 --> 00:18:00,932
Then she should at least have
called us over for some pork rib soup.

250
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:04,497
Just, letting us wait
blindly for Kyeong Ran.

251
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,013
Oh, what is going on?

252
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,769
Is it all right for her to marry
another guy while living at her in-laws?

253
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:10,829
Then,

254
00:18:10,949 --> 00:18:13,490
wouldn't she be chased out of
her Director position at Soul Furniture?

255
00:18:14,317 --> 00:18:16,013
Oh, that's right.

256
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:25,782
Where are the guests looking for Kyeong Ran?

257
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:27,542
Kyeong Ran?

258
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,316
They were just here, maybe they left?

259
00:18:31,436 --> 00:18:32,334
What?

260
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,856
I left a message asking them to wait.

261
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:38,248
Could she have left a message when she left?

262
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,092
<i>There isn't anything.</i>

263
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:41,534
Yes.

264
00:18:53,837 --> 00:18:55,660
You have to wipe your face.

265
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,831
I'll go get you something.

266
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,581
What are you doing right now?

267
00:19:57,701 --> 00:19:58,874
Let me go!

268
00:19:58,994 --> 00:20:00,859
I don't want to live!

269
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:02,322
Stop now, do you hear me?!

270
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,484
Just let me go!

271
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:07,156
This world was never on my side!

272
00:20:07,276 --> 00:20:10,804
Even if I struggled so hard to live,
the result was the same.

273
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:14,217
Since it's a life where I'll never be happy,

274
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:15,574
I should just die.

275
00:20:15,694 --> 00:20:18,076
Who continues living for a reason?

276
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,047
Does anyone just sit there
silently if they have something to say?

277
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,270
Why are you so irresponsible?

278
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,832
<i>Even for your parents,</i>

279
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:31,558
where is the Joo Ah Ran
that would live on courageously?

280
00:20:32,406 --> 00:20:35,471
Even if you crush the whole
world, it'll become yours,

281
00:20:35,591 --> 00:20:37,775
where did that courage go?

282
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:41,910
Dad and Mom will understand too.

283
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:44,624
If I go,

284
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,394
they should welcome me happily.

285
00:20:51,603 --> 00:20:53,766
Don't hold onto me.

286
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,056
Why will you die?!

287
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:03,102
Without my permission,
you don't have the right to die.

288
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:07,384
You have to stay by
my side your entire life,

289
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:10,416
to repent for your sin of betrayal.

290
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,049
What?

291
00:21:12,508 --> 00:21:14,565
Isn't that better.

292
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,635
At least you didn't kill Hyun Woo Hyung,

293
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,904
you're not a murderer,

294
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,294
I thought you would be happy.

295
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:26,244
Shin Hyun Woo is back!

296
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:29,255
Everything has returned to Shin Hyun Woo.

297
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,299
Shin Woo Sub has not lost anything either,
what good is that?

298
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:35,267
I can only think about what I can get now.

299
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:39,253
Ah Ran, you're not Shin Hyun Woo's,

300
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,800
or Ahn Jae Sung's.

301
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,111
You'll stay by my side.

302
00:21:45,023 --> 00:21:47,101
You're crazy.

303
00:21:48,627 --> 00:21:50,302
You're mentally ill.

304
00:21:53,853 --> 00:21:56,270
Why can't you let go of me?

305
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:59,721
I'm a woman that ran off after loving me,
why can't you let me go?!

306
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:00,887
<i>Why?!</i>

307
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,350
Why?!

308
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,537
Why?!

309
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:05,085
Why?!

310
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:13,880
<i>One-sided love, could be my
destiny right from my birth.</i>

311
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:18,778
<i>It's fine if you don't love me,
as long as you're by my side.</i>

312
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:21,831
<i>If even you leave me,</i>

313
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:24,737
<i>I might not be able to live in this world.</i>

314
00:22:43,388 --> 00:22:46,208
<i>Then, it was Nurse Yoon that saved Oppa.</i>

315
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:48,519
That Agasshi looks really intelligent,

316
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:50,978
she has really become
the savior of our family.

317
00:22:51,098 --> 00:22:53,378
It's because of all the fortune
Mom accumulated through her charity,

318
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:55,414
that I managed to get some help.

319
00:22:55,534 --> 00:22:57,127
Without Jae Hee,

320
00:22:57,247 --> 00:23:00,159
I wouldn't have been able
to wake up from my vegetative state,

321
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,432
and dream about living like a human.

322
00:23:03,552 --> 00:23:05,150
What a strange world.

323
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,355
Mom supported Nurse Yoon
throughout university,

324
00:23:07,475 --> 00:23:10,302
and Nurse Yoon saved Hyung's life,

325
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:12,569
<i>which is why people
have to live with kindness.</i>

326
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,858
What a great piece of news after so long.

327
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:19,567
Then, what is with the company?
In name, it is all under Ahn Jae Sung.

328
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:22,853
I've discussed it with the lawyer,
to change it to Shin Hyun Woo.

329
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,846
Then, Sister...

330
00:23:24,966 --> 00:23:26,839
Then, what about that woman Joo Ah Ran?

331
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,391
Of course she has to be judged by the law.

332
00:23:29,984 --> 00:23:34,797
She created two incidents that were
so horrific, and split our family apart.

333
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,557
No matter what she can't be forgiven.

334
00:23:36,677 --> 00:23:39,082
Since you were going to use the law,
why did you wait so long?

335
00:23:39,202 --> 00:23:41,414
When you first woke up, if you
had gone to the police straight away,

336
00:23:41,534 --> 00:23:43,937
at least she wouldn't
have set the villa on fire.

337
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:47,626
I wanted to take all the betrayal
I felt, and give it to her.

338
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,269
I also wanted to know, why Joo Ah Ran
wanted to do such things.

339
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,397
You won't be uncomfortable, right?

340
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:25,202
How about sharing a room
with Hyun Min first?

341
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:26,219
No.

342
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,930
I have a house that I looked for,
I'll just stay there.

343
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,007
You want to live apart from us?

344
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:33,301
Why?

345
00:24:33,421 --> 00:24:36,664
We haven't seen each other for such a long time,
why do you want to live separately?

346
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,801
I will come often, don't worry.

347
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,840
After going through such
a difficult surgery,

348
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,917
you must have suffered so much pain.

349
00:24:47,037 --> 00:24:50,140
How lonely you were, how tired,

350
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,468
Mom couldn't do anything either.

351
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:57,145
Why is Mom sorry?

352
00:24:57,265 --> 00:24:59,986
That's the payback I get
for loving the wrong person.

353
00:25:00,106 --> 00:25:01,428
That's right.

354
00:25:01,548 --> 00:25:05,917
It was you who brought Jae Hee to the
orphanage. How did you know Jae Hee?

355
00:25:07,126 --> 00:25:09,076
What do you mean know?

356
00:25:09,196 --> 00:25:11,790
It was a coincidence that
a friend asked me for a favor.

357
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,407
I was just helping a friend.

358
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:16,209
Is that so?

359
00:25:16,696 --> 00:25:20,831
She said she was going to see her
Unnie, I don't know if she saw her.

360
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,293
Did you meet Ah Ran?

361
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:35,610
Her dead husband actually came
back alive, how embarrassing.

362
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,861
What?

363
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,162
Who came back alive?

364
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:42,286
You don't know?

365
00:25:42,406 --> 00:25:44,533
Ah Ran's husband came back alive.

366
00:25:44,653 --> 00:25:48,856
Our Manager's Hyung didn't die,
he just hid using someone else's name.

367
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:51,676
Oh my, oh my,
what is this?

368
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:55,704
Then, the fact that our Ah Ran is
marrying someone else is out?

369
00:25:55,824 --> 00:26:00,818
It's not that, the groom was that person,
that person was the groom.

370
00:26:00,938 --> 00:26:03,744
What is this girl talking about?

371
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:06,394
Then, you're saying that
after she got married,

372
00:26:06,514 --> 00:26:10,186
two husbands appeared, and her being
chased out, is just a matter of time.

373
00:26:10,306 --> 00:26:12,518
Oh my, oh my,
I'm so frustrated.

374
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:15,380
Oh my, I'm so frustrated.

375
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:28,541
<i>It's locked.</i>

376
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:31,861
Jae Hee, if you kiss it, it could open.

377
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:56,170
I would never love anyone again,
because my heart froze into a block of ice.

378
00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,771
But, you just opened my heart.

379
00:27:02,085 --> 00:27:03,145
Ahjusshi.

380
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,640
Do you... want to marry me?

381
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,050
<i>Kyeong Ran.</i>

382
00:28:08,004 --> 00:28:10,569
<i>Unnie is really tired.</i>

383
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:16,257
<i>That man, was just the son of our enemy.</i>

384
00:28:16,808 --> 00:28:20,434
<i>But, why is my heart being
torn apart because of that man?</i>

385
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:25,271
<i>Since we can't be in love,</i>

386
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:30,720
<i>we might as well, hate each other,
and step all over each other.</i>

387
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,331
The interrogation is going to begin.

388
00:28:45,273 --> 00:28:46,586
July 13,

389
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:49,175
In Seoul, north Changwon,
in Hyun Woo's car,

390
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,820
was involved in a car
accident due to bad driving.

391
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
Who was driving?

392
00:28:57,187 --> 00:28:59,540
Then, my wife, Joo Ah Ran was driving.

393
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,533
That was my husband's, Shin Hyun Woo's car.

394
00:29:01,653 --> 00:29:05,230
When the incident happened, the person sitting
in the driver's seat, was also Shin Hyun Woo.

395
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,043
Now, I'm in front of you.
Are you going to lie?

396
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:14,672
I can take out the black box that
has been kept, as evidence.

397
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:17,026
Officer.

398
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,234
I'm prepared to accept
the punishments for my crimes.

399
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:27,283
But before that, I have a request.

400
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:29,213
A request?

401
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,839
A long time ago,

402
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,083
in the furniture company
that Shin Woo Sub ran,

403
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:38,238
there was a couple who died
because of hidden reasons.

404
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,573
I hope you can investigate that incident.

405
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,821
What are you saying?

406
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:44,835
Who killed who in that furniture company?

407
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:47,337
Do you still not know, even now?

408
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,796
Your father,

409
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:52,164
killed my parents,

410
00:29:52,183 --> 00:29:54,136
in front of my eyes.

411
00:29:55,472 --> 00:29:58,525
And he even cruelly,
crushed them under wood.

412
00:29:58,645 --> 00:29:59,988
<i>Don't lie anymore.</i>

413
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:02,101
I won't be cheated by your
cheap tricks anymore.

414
00:30:02,221 --> 00:30:03,500
It's true.

415
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:06,278
I know Ah Ran.

416
00:30:06,574 --> 00:30:10,051
And it was also because my dad asked
me to take care of Ah Ran when he died.

417
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,982
Because of President,
she grew up as a lonely orphan.

418
00:30:15,512 --> 00:30:19,074
If you don't believe me,
ask your Dad here and ask him.

419
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,106
Letting my poor parents die,

420
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:26,213
and my poor sister run away,
ask him here immediately!

421
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:30,453
Why I had to live,
selling drinks and smiles,

422
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:33,605
was all because of your father.

423
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:39,075
What is all this in the
middle of our interrogation?

424
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:41,831
Shin Hyun Woo.

425
00:30:43,395 --> 00:30:47,550
Now, is what Joo Ah Ran is saying, true?

426
00:30:48,377 --> 00:30:49,479
No.

427
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,002
This is the first time I'm hearing this.

428
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:55,194
How about meeting again
after you've found out the truth?

429
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:59,519
We were also thinking about looking
for a lawyer, to start a true investigation.

430
00:31:04,478 --> 00:31:06,492
You're still alive.

431
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:09,821
But my parents are already dead.

432
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:16,065
Whose crime is bigger,
is clear without even comparing.

433
00:31:42,512 --> 00:31:44,607
Because of your family,
do you know how I lived?

434
00:31:44,727 --> 00:31:46,939
My parents, and my sister!

435
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:50,776
Getting married, to my pathetic
life, is a strand of straw.

436
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:53,681
And a shame to my parents who died wrongly.

437
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:56,925
They worked hard their
entire life in a factory.

438
00:31:57,045 --> 00:32:00,782
But died wrongly because
of a truth they spoke.

439
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:05,488
It was a cover up, for the
murder that they suffered.

440
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:14,139
Even though we've let it out,

441
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:17,595
but the matter with Shin Woo Sub was
something that happened 20 years ago.

442
00:32:17,715 --> 00:32:20,192
It's also past the investigation period.

443
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:25,556
Even if they find the truth out now,
there can't be any punishment.

444
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,483
I know.

445
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,812
We came all this way because
the law can't serve us.

446
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,705
But, it can't be because time has passed,

447
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:39,903
that the crime of breaking
up a family is let go.

448
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,940
For a man like Shin Hyun Woo,

449
00:32:45,258 --> 00:32:49,202
he won't be able to neglect his
father's crime and send me to jail.

450
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,082
Let's go, I'm tired.

451
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:03,166
<i>That's right. We have to say that
Nurse Yoon is Ah Ran's sister.</i>

452
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:06,257
<i>No matter how Hyun Woo
Hyung wants to take revenge,</i>

453
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:10,153
<i>he can't leave the sister
of the woman he loves alone.</i>

454
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:15,072
<i>For Nurse Yoon, he'll have
to destroy all the charges.</i>

455
00:33:19,453 --> 00:33:21,574
Nurse Yoon.

456
00:33:22,316 --> 00:33:24,987
You said you were looking for your Unnie.

457
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:28,761
I'll let you meet her.

458
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:33,502
I know. I'll go when the time comes.

459
00:33:36,195 --> 00:33:38,145
Was it Nam Joo Seung?

460
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:41,481
How could Nam Joo Seung
know where your Unnie is?

461
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:44,322
But, it doesn't seem like he's lying.

462
00:33:44,442 --> 00:33:47,820
He told me to meet him at
6 at Seoul Hotel's coffee shop.

463
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,403
Nam Joo Seung has no
reason to find your Unnie.

464
00:33:51,523 --> 00:33:55,946
All the crimes have been revealed,
there's nowhere to go.

465
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,770
He might do something to you,
you have to be careful.

466
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:00,801
It'll be fine if Ahjusshi comes along.

467
00:34:00,921 --> 00:34:02,829
They're under police
investigation right now,

468
00:34:02,949 --> 00:34:05,415
they wouldn't cause any trouble.

469
00:34:05,535 --> 00:34:07,345
Hurry and go in.

470
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:15,336
Thank you. We were just about
to call you, it's good you came.

471
00:34:15,456 --> 00:34:17,202
You haven't eaten yet, right?

472
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:21,122
It's not like we can repay what
you've done for us with a meal,

473
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:23,179
but at least we can express our gratitude.

474
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:26,081
No, it's not like I've done anything.

475
00:34:26,201 --> 00:34:31,021
Actually, you've sent me to school,
I've been the one who has been getting help.

476
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:36,225
Go wash your hands. On the way here,
didn't you keep saying you were hungry?

477
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:40,359
Sit.

478
00:34:41,706 --> 00:34:44,377
That's right, what happened
at the police station?

479
00:34:44,497 --> 00:34:48,872
Don't feel like you should sympathize
with Joo Ah Ran, don't dream about it.

480
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,183
Other than that, Father,

481
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:55,540
when you were running Geum Ok Furniture,
were there any employees that died while working?

482
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:01,419
A couple that died on the same day,
did that death happen when Dad was in charge?

483
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,366
What? Who told you that?

484
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:07,084
Hurry and drag that person
over by his collar!

485
00:35:07,204 --> 00:35:09,968
Please tell me,
I have to know.

486
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:12,064
Those are all things in the past.

487
00:35:12,184 --> 00:35:15,329
They died because of a mistake they made,
why do you have to blame it on me?

488
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,295
<i>Looks like they want to find
someone to take revenge on,</i>

489
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:20,755
do they think I'll blink because of that?

490
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:22,237
You remember it too, don't you?

491
00:35:22,357 --> 00:35:23,890
That brother-in-law and his wife,
barged into the office,

492
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,692
and made a nuisance of themselves.

493
00:35:25,812 --> 00:35:27,304
<i>Do you not remember?</i>

494
00:35:27,424 --> 00:35:29,197
Yes, I remember.

495
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:31,550
Then, did you compensate them?

496
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,200
Is there any evidence of compensation?

497
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,126
<i>These are the secret accounts
for Geum Ok Furniture.</i>

498
00:35:37,246 --> 00:35:39,140
<i>Secretary Nam was in charge of it.</i>

499
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,633
<i>Not long ago, Joo Seung said it was part
of Secretary Nam's things, and brought it here.</i>

500
00:35:44,354 --> 00:35:48,552
Then, the company wasn't doing well,
so we couldn't give much compensation.

501
00:35:48,672 --> 00:35:51,800
But giving that amount was already enough.

502
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,030
But,

503
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,256
did they really die because of an accident?

504
00:35:55,376 --> 00:35:57,525
I said it was so, why won't you believe me?

505
00:35:57,645 --> 00:35:58,479
But,

506
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:01,032
who told you all of this?

507
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,615
Did that brother and his wife,
come look for you?

508
00:36:06,481 --> 00:36:07,499
Actually,

509
00:36:08,008 --> 00:36:11,980
Joo Ah Ran, is the daughter
of the couple that died.

510
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,654
What?

511
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:18,189
Joo Ah Ran is the daughter
of Factory Manager Joo Chul Min?

512
00:36:19,907 --> 00:36:21,603
How can something like
that happen in this world?

513
00:36:21,723 --> 00:36:25,467
That means, she had bad intentions
when she married into our family?

514
00:36:25,587 --> 00:36:28,393
She thought I killed her
father, or something?

515
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,907
No matter what methods Joo Ah Ran uses,
she'll use that incident to force my hand.

516
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,541
I can't handle the situation
without knowing the truth.

517
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:37,915
That factory manager was frustrating
me because of his bad behavior,

518
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:40,989
it was true that his relationship
with me was bad.

519
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:44,232
But, am I the kind of person
that will kill a person so he'll shut up?

520
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,882
<i>Don't be influenced by her.</i>

521
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:49,384
<i>You have to get Joo Ah Ran to repent
for every single one of her crimes.</i>

522
00:36:50,974 --> 00:36:53,349
Yes, I believe Father.

523
00:36:54,118 --> 00:36:56,387
I'll take care of this account book.

524
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:01,369
I heard Hyun Woo say you
we’re going to meet your sister.

525
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:03,150
Did you meet her?

526
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,761
I haven't met her yet,

527
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:07,793
there were too many things
going on yesterday.

528
00:37:07,913 --> 00:37:10,973
Maybe I'll meet her tonight.

529
00:37:11,093 --> 00:37:12,818
Ah, is that so?

530
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:15,805
Being able to meet my family,
is something that I never even dreamt about.

531
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,798
I'm especially excited and happy.

532
00:37:17,918 --> 00:37:21,593
Tonight, I'm meeting Unnie,
Ahjusshi also promised to come with me.

533
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,537
Ah, sit.

534
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:30,413
There's nothing much, just eat up.

535
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:33,805
It looks delicious,
I'll eat well.

536
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:38,430
Nurse Yoon looks like she
hasn't gotten married.

537
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,953
Is there a person you have in mind?

538
00:37:45,299 --> 00:37:47,915
I was going to tell you after dinner,

539
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:51,074
but after the police investigations
and all the complications are settled,

540
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,601
I was thinking of marrying Jae Hee.

541
00:37:52,721 --> 00:37:55,145
<i>Marrying? It isn't anything bad too.</i>

542
00:37:55,265 --> 00:37:59,150
<i>When you were in trouble, you spent it together,
looking at each other and relying on each other.</i>

543
00:38:00,146 --> 00:38:03,009
Although it's a shame
you don't have parents,

544
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:05,532
as long as you're not the
daughter of Joo Chul Min.

545
00:38:05,652 --> 00:38:08,490
What do you think?
They're quite compatible, right?

546
00:38:08,893 --> 00:38:09,868
Yes?

547
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:12,073
Until now...

548
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:24,039
Ah, let me go.

549
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,714
I said, I don't like it!

550
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:28,089
Why don't you like it?

551
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:32,174
I said I want to introduce you formally
to my family, does that make you so angry?

552
00:38:32,294 --> 00:38:34,357
You said we were going somewhere else,
and asked me to dress up,

553
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:36,138
so we're going to your house?

554
00:38:36,258 --> 00:38:38,852
When did I say I would marry you, Manager?

555
00:38:38,972 --> 00:38:41,417
Then, Yeon Jae, you don't like me?

556
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,876
You haven't had any feelings
for me all this time?

557
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:47,162
Even though it's not the case,
but it's not marriage either.

558
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:49,153
I don't want to be the daughter-in-law
of such a powerful family,

559
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:52,439
and then go around being bullied
like I have a needle stuck in my heart.

560
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:55,499
Is that the reason you don't want to?

561
00:38:56,135 --> 00:38:59,866
It looks like Hyung is telling them he
wants to marry Nurse Yoon today.

562
00:38:59,986 --> 00:39:02,919
Nurse Yoon and Yeon Jae
are not very different.

563
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,997
She grew up alone in an orphanage,

564
00:39:05,117 --> 00:39:06,631
and had a hard time going to school too.

565
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:08,476
Even so, she's a lady.

566
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,465
Your brother has been divorced before,
and now he's marrying a lady...

567
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,179
What conditions could he ask for?

568
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:18,205
Then, are we married,
or someone insignificant?

569
00:39:18,714 --> 00:39:21,152
<i>What's the difference?</i>

570
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:25,011
I'm not a lady!

571
00:39:25,348 --> 00:39:27,405
Actually, he already died.

572
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:30,436
What... What?

573
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:33,171
Although he died before
we could register it,

574
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:35,143
but I've also had a wedding ceremony
where everybody came together,

575
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,364
I clearly had a husband.

576
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:42,050
Although that idiot left a huge debt,
but, he was my husband for a day.

577
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,552
So, Manager, you wake up too.

578
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:53,493
It... It can't be.

579
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,267
Yeon Jae... How could she...?

580
00:40:00,116 --> 00:40:05,416
Hyun Woo, are you really,
going to marry Nurse Yoon?

581
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:06,731
Yes.

582
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,185
Once the divorce is settled,
I'm going to marry her.

583
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:10,902
That won't do.

584
00:40:11,022 --> 00:40:13,277
You can't marry her, I don't agree.

585
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:16,097
Why? Because she's an orphan?

586
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:19,054
<i>Mom, you know too, what kind
of person Jae Hee is to me.</i>

587
00:40:19,372 --> 00:40:20,962
Without Jae Hee, I wouldn't
be the person I am today.

588
00:40:21,082 --> 00:40:23,676
You can repay that gratitude
in a different way,

589
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,135
you don't have to get married
because you're thankful.

590
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:29,188
<i>If she needs money, help her with money.</i>

591
00:40:29,951 --> 00:40:33,937
Mother, this sort of groundless
refusal doesn't seem like my mother at all.

592
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,460
You have to at least give me a reason.

593
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,859
Hyun Woo,

594
00:40:38,674 --> 00:40:43,126
although you loved Ah Ran,
you didn't know everything about Ah Ran.

595
00:40:43,246 --> 00:40:44,695
<i>Jae Hee is the same too.</i>

596
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:46,497
What parents gave birth to her,

597
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:48,851
what her past was like,
you don't have any idea.

598
00:40:48,971 --> 00:40:51,070
Why, do you want to marry someone like that?

599
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:53,678
- Ah Ran and Jae Hee are different.
- There's no difference!

600
00:40:53,798 --> 00:40:54,922
Actually...

601
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,321
Actually... Jae Hee...

602
00:40:58,441 --> 00:40:59,529
<i>Hyung,</i>

603
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,551
what are you doing here?

604
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,399
Marry me.

605
00:41:41,671 --> 00:41:44,222
Don't touch my woman!

606
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:45,405
What?

607
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,632
Yoon Jae Hee,
is the woman I love.

608
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:50,731
<i>Don't use your cruel hands,</i>

609
00:41:50,851 --> 00:41:53,381
to touch a single hair of the woman I love.

610
00:41:56,703 --> 00:41:57,763
No,

611
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:00,371
I can't give up.

612
00:42:00,816 --> 00:42:04,214
Whether that man is Shin Hyun Woo,
or Ahn Jae Sung, I can't give up.

613
00:42:06,885 --> 00:42:09,429
He was clearly in front of me.

614
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:15,296
My heart is clearly still beating.

615
00:42:18,688 --> 00:42:21,741
It doesn't matter if I love him or hate him.

616
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:25,923
I can never give that man to Yoon Jae Hee.

617
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,760
Ah Ran came here, right?

618
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,159
Where is she?

619
00:42:59,279 --> 00:43:01,066
Why would she come here?

620
00:43:01,186 --> 00:43:02,274
Did you forget?

621
00:43:02,394 --> 00:43:04,945
Our Hyun Woo came back alive.

622
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,172
Is that so?

623
00:43:08,108 --> 00:43:10,631
Your tone makes you sound really grateful.

624
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:15,953
But, Hyun Woo coming back alive,
for Madam, you aren't just happy, right?

625
00:43:16,716 --> 00:43:20,246
Hyun Woo, will continue
hanging out to Ah Ran.

626
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:24,868
Then, the only people that will be hurt,
will be your family, Madam.

627
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:31,121
Hyun Woo clings on to Ah Ran,
Ah Ran clings on to your family.

628
00:43:32,033 --> 00:43:34,259
<i>What an interesting cycle.</i>

629
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:36,803
Oh right,

630
00:43:37,842 --> 00:43:43,505
I'll take this opportunity, maybe the secret
between Madam and I will be exposed.

631
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:46,325
Why in the world are you doing this?

632
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:50,332
If you want to take revenge against me,
and linked hands with Ah Ran,

633
00:43:50,452 --> 00:43:52,158
please stop.

634
00:43:52,278 --> 00:43:55,571
For Ah Ran, how much of
your life do you want to ruin?

635
00:43:55,691 --> 00:43:59,621
Your doctor's license has already been
suspended, how are you going to live?

636
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:03,104
Half a son is still a son,
are you worrying about me now?

637
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:07,005
But, no matter what happens,

638
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:09,252
I won't abandon Ah Ran.

639
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:15,006
I'll stand by... my father's
words to watch over Ah Ran.

640
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:17,327
Joo Seung.

641
00:44:19,426 --> 00:44:21,610
Madam, you know too, right?

642
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:25,968
Ah Ran's sister, is Nurse Yoon.

643
00:44:27,474 --> 00:44:29,382
How did you know?

644
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:32,922
The person who handed Nurse Yoon
to the orphanage and kept supporting her...

645
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,879
was you, Madam, right?

646
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:40,585
You wanted to redeem your crime
of killing Ah Ran's parents, right?

647
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,490
<i>But, by your hand,</i>

648
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:47,550
Hyun Woo and Nurse Yoon,
me and Ah Ran,

649
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:51,557
two brothers and two sisters,
have an inseparable relationship.

650
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:55,985
This life is interesting, right?

651
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,407
Hold on.

652
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,888
I have to talk to you,

653
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:27,313
about why I wanted to marry
you and created all this.

654
00:45:36,294 --> 00:45:40,153
You want to say that my
parents killed your parents,

655
00:45:40,273 --> 00:45:42,527
<i>stop creating trouble.</i>

656
00:45:45,116 --> 00:45:48,211
Your parents died because of an accident.

657
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:53,405
Here is evidence that your uncle signed,
and we also paid you compensation.

658
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,554
How can you believe that account book?

659
00:45:57,763 --> 00:46:00,116
Have you thought that it
could have been faked?

660
00:46:00,236 --> 00:46:02,533
Stop trying those cheap threats!

661
00:46:03,614 --> 00:46:05,674
It looks like you want
to use those baseless excuses,

662
00:46:05,794 --> 00:46:08,345
to get yourself off.

663
00:46:08,465 --> 00:46:10,826
I'll never let you off that easily.

664
00:46:19,755 --> 00:46:21,491
Jae Hee, it's me.

665
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,781
<i>I'll be late.</i>

666
00:46:24,387 --> 00:46:26,346
You go to the wedding dress shop first.

667
00:46:26,466 --> 00:46:28,060
I'll be there.

668
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,919
Wedding shop?

669
00:46:34,654 --> 00:46:40,818
You've made me so pathetic,
and you want to marry Yoon Jae Hee?

670
00:46:44,337 --> 00:46:48,561
Then, the ring, necklace, and the earrings
you gave me, what are these?

671
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,657
Was it all efforts to trick me?!

672
00:46:54,998 --> 00:46:56,651
All right.

673
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,785
You and I,

674
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:06,303
will die here today.

675
00:47:11,738 --> 00:47:13,582
Stop the car immediately!

676
00:47:13,702 --> 00:47:15,066
I'm not stopping!

677
00:47:15,116 --> 00:47:17,092
Even if you can't be with me forever,

678
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,816
I can't watch you go back
to Yoon Jae Hee's side.

679
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:20,854
All right.

680
00:47:20,974 --> 00:47:25,707
I won't die in your hands,
much less die with you!

681
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:44,221
Jae Sung.

682
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,574
Look at me.

683
00:47:48,758 --> 00:47:52,235
Besides your parents,
and my parents,

684
00:47:53,152 --> 00:47:55,357
let the two of us talk.

685
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:57,562
Wake up.

686
00:47:57,682 --> 00:48:00,149
I'm not Ahn Jae Sung,
I'm Shin Hyun Woo.

687
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:02,118
Did you forget?

688
00:48:02,712 --> 00:48:07,843
My heart still remembers Ahn Jae Sung,
what do you want me to do?

689
00:48:09,167 --> 00:48:13,897
Please take away the memories
of Ahn Jae Sung in my heart too, please.

690
00:48:18,444 --> 00:48:21,222
Such a woman like you is really disgusting.

691
00:48:21,518 --> 00:48:24,741
You just explained that it was because
of your parents that you sought revenge.

692
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:27,778
Now, you're saying it's for love?

693
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,601
But what can I do?

694
00:48:29,721 --> 00:48:32,999
I didn't want to spend a single
cent of my money buying your love.

695
00:48:33,784 --> 00:48:35,904
If you want love so much,

696
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:38,596
how about going back to being Rosemary?

697
00:48:53,937 --> 00:48:55,061
Ahn Jae Sung.

698
00:48:57,054 --> 00:48:59,386
You underestimate me.

699
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:03,033
I won't die that easily.

700
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:24,714
Are you Yoon Jae Hee?

701
00:49:24,834 --> 00:49:25,443
Yes.

702
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,952
President Ahn Jae Sun
asked me to pick you up.

703
00:49:28,072 --> 00:49:29,686
Ahjusshi?

704
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:31,467
He asked me to wait here.

705
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:34,506
He said he would take a long time.

706
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,499
Please get in the car.

707
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,061
Who are you?

708
00:49:58,861 --> 00:49:59,751
Where's my guest?

709
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,448
<i>She's not here yet.</i>

710
00:50:01,568 --> 00:50:03,695
What? Not here yet?

711
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:06,996
The time has already passed.

712
00:50:10,537 --> 00:50:13,505
<i>Your call cannot be connected right now...</i>

713
00:50:17,563 --> 00:50:19,005
Jae Hee.

714
00:50:26,495 --> 00:50:28,594
Jae Hee, where are you?

715
00:50:28,714 --> 00:50:31,689
Nothing happened, right?
Everything is fine, right?

716
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:37,523
<i>Tonight, at 6, he asked me to go
to Seoul Hotel's Coffee shop.</i>

717
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:52,786
Where did you go?

718
00:50:52,906 --> 00:50:56,391
In the future, no matter
what you do, tell me.

719
00:50:58,466 --> 00:51:00,268
Joo Seung.

720
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,648
Do you still have anything you need me for?

721
00:51:04,326 --> 00:51:08,974
You clearly know that being
with me will be dangerous for you.

722
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:10,671
Why aren't you leaving?

723
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:13,193
I still have things to do for you.

724
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:18,715
I contacted Kyeong Ran.

725
00:51:19,224 --> 00:51:23,337
We made an appointment to meet
at Seoul Hotel's coffee shop at 6.

726
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,604
Is that true?

727
00:51:26,724 --> 00:51:28,597
How do you know Kyeong Ran?

728
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:30,780
How I know her, you'll
understand when we meet.

729
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,600
Hurry and get ready. It's almost time.

730
00:51:59,167 --> 00:52:02,411
<i>Ah Ran. Don't hate me.</i>

731
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:05,400
<i>This is the best choice I can make for you.</i>

732
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,775
<i>If you don't hurry and capture Yoon Jae Hee,</i>

733
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,264
<i>you won't escape the palm of Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

734
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:47,057
What are you doing here?

735
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:49,092
Where's Jae Hee?

736
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,298
What have you done to Jae Hee?

737
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:54,906
From the afternoon,
Jae Hee has been missing.

738
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:57,387
Nurse Yoon is missing?

739
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:05,198
She's not at home, she's not picking up her
phone, her person has gone missing.

740
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:08,505
If the two of you have messed with Jae Hee,

741
00:53:09,174 --> 00:53:12,121
I'll risk my life, and
not let the two of you go.

742
00:53:18,167 --> 00:53:21,898
Those leather shoes,
whose are those?

743
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:28,937
It has nothing to do with you.

744
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:32,699
I've made an appointment
with someone really important.

745
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:34,971
Please don't pretend you're interested,
and leave.

746
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:36,367
<i>No.</i>

747
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:39,780
This has something to do with Hyung.

748
00:53:40,837 --> 00:53:42,375
Take a seat.

749
00:53:42,799 --> 00:53:45,725
Since you're here, I want to
tell you about Ah Ran's sister.

750
00:53:46,743 --> 00:53:48,566
What does that mean?

751
00:53:49,023 --> 00:53:51,300
Why do we have to tell him about Kyeong Ran?

752
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,318
Kyeong Ran?

753
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:56,431
My real name isn't Jae Hee, it's Kyeong Ran.

754
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:59,611
- Kyeong Ran?
- That's right, Kyeong Ran.

755
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,390
Hyung, you know her too.

756
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,630
How does he know our Kyeong Ran?

757
00:54:10,644 --> 00:54:12,099
Because Kyeong Ran...

758
00:54:13,118 --> 00:54:14,635
is Nurse Yoon.

759
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:20,789
What?

760
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:23,651
Nurse Yoon's real name is Joo Kyeong Ran.

761
00:54:24,966 --> 00:54:27,573
<i>When your parents died,</i>

762
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:31,545
Madam handed Kyeong Ran
over to Angel Orphanage.

763
00:54:33,468 --> 00:54:35,531
That can't be.

764
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,759
Yoon Jae Hee is Kyeong Ran.

765
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:44,278
Our Kyeong Ran...

766
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:47,374
how could she be Yoon Jae Hee?

767
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:02,095
Jae Hee...

768
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,509
is Joo Ah Ran's sister.

769
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,753
That can't be.

770
00:55:42,158 --> 00:55:44,024
Open the door!

771
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:47,395
Please open the door!

772
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:49,769
<i>Someone!</i>

773
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:56,485
When did you know?

774
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:00,619
Why didn't you tell me, why?

775
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:03,164
I only found out not long ago.

776
00:56:03,722 --> 00:56:06,266
I was afraid you would be affected,
so I didn't tell you.

777
00:56:07,348 --> 00:56:09,574
Why does it have to be Yoon Jae Hee?

778
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:13,305
The sister I was looking so desperately for,

779
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:15,785
why did it have to be Yoon Jae Hee?

780
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:18,986
<i>How does it feel?</i>

781
00:56:19,665 --> 00:56:24,202
Hyung, the woman you hate the most and
the woman you love the most are actually sisters.

782
00:56:24,773 --> 00:56:26,448
<i>Their blood is connected.</i>

783
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:28,356
Sisters who have met only after 25 years,

784
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:30,158
are they going to go against
that because of you, Hyung?

785
00:56:30,278 --> 00:56:32,279
No, it can't be!

786
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,056
Jae Hee can't be sisters with Joo Ah Ran!

787
00:56:35,176 --> 00:56:37,808
If you don't believe me, go
ask Madam personally.

788
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:40,161
Madam knows everything.

789
00:56:41,328 --> 00:56:42,790
What?

790
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:45,589
It's all a lie.

791
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,840
I don't believe it.

792
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,342
I can't not recognize my sister.

793
00:56:50,936 --> 00:56:53,247
Something must have gone wrong.

794
00:56:53,367 --> 00:56:55,812
Yoon Jae Hee is not my sister!

795
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,365
Nurse Yoon...

796
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:46,156
is our Kyeong Ran?

797
00:57:47,815 --> 00:57:50,317
She's my sister?

798
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:23,731
That's really strange.

799
00:58:24,389 --> 00:58:26,827
Sisters born by the same parents.

800
00:58:26,947 --> 00:58:33,232
One wants to give someone love,
one wants to give someone hate.

801
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:43,039
Nurse Yoon, even if she's Joo Ah Ran's
sister, you haven't been moved, right?

802
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,060
I don't know either.

803
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,901
Why is everything so complicated?

804
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:57,809
Because of me, what if
something happens to her?

805
00:58:58,445 --> 00:59:00,888
My heart is so restless
it's about to explode.

806
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:05,002
I can't let Jae Hee get
hurt because of my revenge.

807
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:08,945
Don't worry too much.

808
00:59:09,065 --> 00:59:12,169
It'll definitely be all right.

809
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:24,974
When you can't do anything,
just don't do anything.

810
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:32,833
We can only wait for time to pass,
and let the storm settle.

811
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:40,105
Love is really difficult.

812
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:15,214
You really don't know where Nurse Yoon is?

813
01:00:18,245 --> 01:00:19,835
I don't know.

814
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:26,039
What are your plans for the future?

815
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,071
Even if I'm Yoon Jae Hee's sister,
what difference does it make?

816
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,885
I'm still Joo Ah Ran.

817
01:00:41,755 --> 01:00:45,083
<i>What a really cheap and unsalvageable woman.</i>

818
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:51,000
<i>I've always especially despised you,
but I think you're pathetic today.</i>

819
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:56,067
<i>In order to live such a terrible life, your mother
suffered so much pain to give birth to you?</i>

820
01:00:56,187 --> 01:00:57,664
<i>How pathetic.</i>

821
01:00:58,915 --> 01:01:00,357
Mom.

822
01:01:01,014 --> 01:01:02,413
Dad.

823
01:01:04,595 --> 01:01:06,567
What should I do?

824
01:01:09,726 --> 01:01:11,528
Tell me.

825
01:01:14,846 --> 01:01:17,390
I shouldn't have looked for Kyeong Ran.

826
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:21,991
I should have just thought she was dead.

827
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:25,608
Then, I wouldn't be in so much pain now.

828
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:28,229
Jae Hee is Joo Ah Ran's sister,

829
01:02:28,801 --> 01:02:30,349
is this true?

830
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:33,656
How do you know?

831
01:02:33,776 --> 01:02:35,585
So it's true.

832
01:02:36,411 --> 01:02:38,447
Till the end, I hoped it wouldn't be true.

833
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,076
That's why I objected to your marriage.

834
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:43,238
Does Jae Hee know too?

835
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:45,830
She still doesn't know.

836
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:48,989
From yesterday afternoon,
she's been missing.

837
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:51,851
Missing? What does that mean?

838
01:02:52,487 --> 01:02:55,435
No matter what, I think Ah Ran
has done something to Jae Hee.

839
01:02:55,555 --> 01:02:57,195
I have a bad feeling.

840
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:01,053
If nothing happened, she wouldn't
be uncontactable like this.

841
01:03:02,644 --> 01:03:04,594
My guess was too shallow.

842
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,619
I shouldn't have helped that child.

843
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:10,923
<i>If I hadn't helped that child,
you wouldn't have met like that,</i>

844
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:15,375
and Ah Ran and Jae Hee, wouldn't
meet under these consequences.

845
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:19,774
Even if it wasn't for Mother, people who
were meant to meet, will still meet.

846
01:03:20,241 --> 01:03:23,866
Jae Hee is Ah Ran's sister,
but my heart won't change either.

847
01:03:23,986 --> 01:03:25,795
I want to marry Jae Hee.

848
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:27,534
That won't do.

849
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:31,217
Ah Ran is your wife,
your legally married wife.

850
01:03:31,337 --> 01:03:33,443
But, how could you marry Ah Ran's sister?

851
01:03:33,563 --> 01:03:35,160
That's incest.

852
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:38,890
Even so, I have to take
responsibility for Jae Hee.

853
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,773
No matter what, I can't let her get hurt.

854
01:03:42,087 --> 01:03:44,843
If something happens to her because of me,

855
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:47,100
I'll never forgive myself.

856
01:03:48,817 --> 01:03:50,216
Hyun Woo.

857
01:03:51,043 --> 01:03:53,651
Even though I'm sorry to say this,

858
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:57,897
can you not press charges against Joo Seung?

859
01:03:58,427 --> 01:04:00,187
No matter what, to you,

860
01:04:00,307 --> 01:04:03,198
he was a child that was
like a younger brother.

861
01:04:04,936 --> 01:04:06,484
This time,

862
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:09,607
there are burdens that
he has to bear as well.

863
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,826
Mom should harden her heart,
and just watch.

864
01:04:24,614 --> 01:04:26,056
Shin Hyun Woo.

865
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,959
Do we have to go all the way?

866
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,249
This cannot continue.

867
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:33,221
No matter what card Shin Hyun Woo plays,

868
01:04:33,341 --> 01:04:35,850
we have to make preparations.

869
01:04:36,189 --> 01:04:39,062
<i>There's a lawyer we know, you go meet him.</i>

870
01:04:39,182 --> 01:04:41,987
I have to go around and
make preparations too.

871
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:48,666
She's all right, right?

872
01:04:48,786 --> 01:04:50,817
Don't do anything to her, just monitor her.

873
01:04:50,937 --> 01:04:52,513
I'm leaving right now.

874
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:04,991
All right, Joo Ah Ran,
you make your move.

875
01:05:05,373 --> 01:05:07,662
Now that you know that
Jae Hee is your sister,

876
01:05:07,782 --> 01:05:10,567
you can't be completely unmoved either.

877
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,309
All right.

878
01:05:21,903 --> 01:05:24,468
Since this is the case,
I have no choice either.

879
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,436
I can only tell the truth now.

880
01:05:33,705 --> 01:05:36,715
This is Maria Nunnery, right?

881
01:06:23,139 --> 01:06:24,263
No!

882
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:26,693
Come down. No.

883
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:32,735
So it was you,
who shut me here.

884
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:38,106
Not only are you not repenting,
are you going to continue doing evil?

885
01:06:38,636 --> 01:06:41,243
<i>I won't be controlled by you anymore,</i>

886
01:06:41,363 --> 01:06:42,833
rather than that,

887
01:06:42,953 --> 01:06:47,529
I might as well jump down
from here and break both my legs.

888
01:06:50,624 --> 01:06:52,427
No! It's dangerous!

889
01:07:03,836 --> 01:07:05,002
Jae Hee!

890
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:06,931
No, don't move.

891
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:08,118
Ahjussi.

892
01:07:09,454 --> 01:07:11,659
<i>No! Kyeong Ran!</i>

893
01:07:17,747 --> 01:07:18,658
No.

894
01:07:21,879 --> 01:07:23,673
I promised Mom.

895
01:07:25,331 --> 01:07:27,748
I would take care of you.

896
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:51,028
No.

897
01:07:55,423 --> 01:07:56,949
It can't be.

898
01:07:57,069 --> 01:07:58,836
It can't be!

899
01:08:06,876 --> 01:08:07,639
Jae Hee!

900
01:08:07,759 --> 01:08:09,420
No! Kyeong Ran!

906
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,930
<i>Joo Ah Ran is really my sister?</i>

907
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:23,223
She isn't right?

908
01:08:23,343 --> 01:08:26,073
<i>How can such a frightening
person be my Unnie?</i>

909
01:08:26,193 --> 01:08:27,557
We're not sisters anymore.

910
01:08:27,677 --> 01:08:30,610
<i>There's only Shin Hyun Woo's
woman, Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

911
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:32,646
Joo Ah Ran is Joo Ah Ran,
Yoon Jae Hee is Yoon Jae Hee.

912
01:08:32,766 --> 01:08:34,130
<i>I'm going to kill them all.</i>

913
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:35,151
<i>The President...</i>

914
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:37,102
<i>Your Mother and Hyun Woo.</i>

915
01:08:37,222 --> 01:08:38,692
<i>You found the real Ahn Jae Sung?</i>

916
01:08:38,812 --> 01:08:41,614
If only the real Ahn Jae Sung is alive, every
contract that Shin Hyun Woo made would be a fraud.

917
01:08:41,734 --> 01:08:44,603
<i>The person who spoilt the wheel,
was you, Shin Woo Sub, right?</i>

918
01:08:44,723 --> 01:08:46,537
<i>You left out an important detail.</i>

919
01:08:46,657 --> 01:08:48,403
<i>My dad has two daughters,</i>

920
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:51,053
the elder daughter is me, the
younger daughter is Yoon Jae Hee,

921
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,301
Father's prospective daughter-in-law.

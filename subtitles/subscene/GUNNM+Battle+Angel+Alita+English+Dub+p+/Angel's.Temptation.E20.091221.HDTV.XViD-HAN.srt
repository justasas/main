00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,940
Temptation Of An Angel

3
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:29,009
Honey!

4
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:42,587
Jae Hee!

5
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:47,232
Episode 20

6
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,215
Where did you go, that
you're only returning now?

7
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,045
Do you know how worried I was?

8
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:53,747
It's a relief, that you're all right.

9
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:57,501
I'm tired, I'm going to rest.

10
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,097
I know it's tiring for you,

11
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:04,288
but there's no evidence, why do you
have to have suspicions first?

12
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:08,951
Didn't Manager Jung say,
all the screws were loosened,

13
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,206
if it wasn't intentional, how could
something like that happen?

14
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:16,568
If you believe that, Jae Hee, then there's
nothing that we can do about it.

15
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:18,897
Please don't be moved anymore.

16
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:20,897
Didn't you say you would believe me,
and go all the way with me?

17
00:01:21,017 --> 00:01:25,258
Even so, how could I change
the fact that I'm Joo Kyeong Ran?

18
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:28,334
Just like Ahjusshi isn't
Ahn Jae Sung, but Shin Hyun Woo,

19
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:31,163
the blood in our bodies
cannot be changed.

20
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:37,454
<i>Mother</i>

21
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:41,321
Yes, Mother.

22
00:01:42,832 --> 00:01:44,449
Why are you crying?

23
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:46,832
What?

24
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,151
What happened? Why did an
accident suddenly happen?!

25
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,640
Madam jumped into traffic,
in order to save her...

26
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,790
Mom, why did you do that?

27
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,229
Were you afraid that Dad would blame you,

28
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:05,237
so you wanted to kill him yourself?

29
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,197
<i>Is that it?!</i>

30
00:02:07,538 --> 00:02:08,750
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:11,516
Stop saying sorry!

32
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:14,935
You hid the fact that you gave birth to
Joo Seung Hyun from Dad for thirty years,

33
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:17,147
to Mom, is there anything
else that is real?!

34
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:19,956
- Mom, you're a hypocrite too!
- Stop it!

35
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:22,233
Dad is still lying in the operating theatre.

36
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:25,481
Do you think he'll feel
good if he hears us arguing?

37
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:27,566
Oppa, you should be the one to stop it.

38
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:30,332
It's because of Joo Ah Ran
that our family is in this state.

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,162
<i>Why did you bring Joo Ah Ran's sister here?</i>

40
00:02:33,282 --> 00:02:34,782
Take that woman away immediately!

41
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,356
Shin Hyun Ji!

42
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:43,399
Doctor! How's the situation?

43
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:45,036
He should be fine after
the operation, right?

44
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:47,185
Is he really badly hurt?

45
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:51,228
When the accident happened, his spinal
nerves suffered a great amount of damage,

46
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:54,036
<i>and there was a lot of bleeding,</i>

47
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:56,467
the situation isn't good.

48
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,573
What does that mean?

49
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:01,552
My father...
Will he die?

50
00:03:01,672 --> 00:03:03,297
Doctor...

51
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,742
no matter what, please save him.

52
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:07,997
It doesn't matter what happens to me,

53
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:11,933
you can take anything from my body.

54
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,678
Doctor, as long as you can save him,

55
00:03:14,798 --> 00:03:17,241
it doesn't matter what condition he is in.

56
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:20,071
Let Ah Ran take me away!

57
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:23,624
The one who is guilty is me,
why is he being punished?

58
00:03:24,922 --> 00:03:29,693
Ah Ran made a mistake,
she punished the wrong person.

59
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>How about the car?</i>

60
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,838
I abandoned it, and ran away.
I've been taking the subway.

61
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,175
Good job.

62
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,135
Even though it's tiring,
hold on for a while more.

63
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,901
No matter if it's Hyun Woo
Hyung or President,

64
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,924
we can't let them do anything, we have
to prepare for it, and then retaliate.

65
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:06,002
Shin Hyun Woo wasn't even in the villa,

66
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:09,079
how could they say we attempted
to kill someone by setting the fire?

67
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,590
Even then, there is no
evidence that I set the fire.

68
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,377
Even so, that side has
the black box from the car.

69
00:04:14,497 --> 00:04:17,462
With that evidence, we can't escape,

70
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:20,158
it's enough to convict us
of attempted murder.

71
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:26,499
This feels like when I was 18 again.

72
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,309
I knew that Aunt was going
to sell me to a forty year old man,

73
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:35,139
I was hiding everywhere like
a crazy person the whole night.

74
00:04:35,735 --> 00:04:40,024
I really don't want to remember the feeling
of being chased everywhere again.

75
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,598
No matter what, we have to push
Hyun Woo Hyung into desperation,

76
00:04:42,718 --> 00:04:45,364
so he'll stop pursuing you.

77
00:04:45,917 --> 00:04:49,002
Even if he's convicted of identity theft,

78
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,491
he will never let you off.

79
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,773
The spinal nerves are severely damaged,

80
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:57,475
looks like he'll be paralyzed
from the waist down.

81
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,283
What?

82
00:04:59,403 --> 00:05:01,672
Paralyzed from the waist down?

83
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,416
Honey.

84
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,587
<i>It'll be a great blow to him.</i>

85
00:05:05,707 --> 00:05:10,395
How about hiding it from the patient first?

86
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:12,929
Then, I'll leave first.

87
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,121
Father!

88
00:05:20,897 --> 00:05:22,919
<i>How could our Father...</i>

89
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,514
<i>He lived by his pride all along.</i>

90
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:28,582
Betrayed by his wife,
and now unable to walk,

91
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:31,156
how is he going to live?

92
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,645
Hyun Woo.

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,858
Yes, Father.

94
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,667
Are you awake?

95
00:05:39,787 --> 00:05:41,274
Can you recognize me?

96
00:05:41,394 --> 00:05:43,011
-Father.
- Dad.

97
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,607
Where's your mother?

98
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,735
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:52,135
I didn't die, and I'm still alive.

100
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,284
It's good that you're still alive.

101
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,667
If you died,

102
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:01,849
I would follow you all the
way to hell to torture you.

103
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:05,636
Why did you save me?
You should have just let me die.

104
00:06:06,956 --> 00:06:10,658
You made me guilty for the rest of my life,
how am I going to face you?

105
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:13,122
I'm fine.

106
00:06:13,394 --> 00:06:16,356
Shin Woo Sub...

107
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:19,973
will not die like that.

108
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:26,366
<i>If you were hit, your bones
might not been left behind.</i>

109
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,196
That's why I survived.

110
00:06:29,813 --> 00:06:32,090
Dad, don't talk too much.

111
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,257
You had a big surgery,
so you have to rest more.

112
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:38,449
What surgery did I have?

113
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,066
Look, I can even talk now.

114
00:06:42,534 --> 00:06:45,451
It means my injuries aren't too bad.

115
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:50,260
<i>Your mother can stay,
the rest of you can go back.</i>

116
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,834
<i>It's too noisy.</i>

117
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,401
What's the matter in
the middle of the night?

118
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,933
Did something change?

119
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:15,662
President Shin Woo Sub,
is in the hospital right now.

120
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:19,917
He's paralyzed from the waist down,
because of a traffic accident.

121
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,322
What?

122
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,657
In the end, God still punished him.

123
00:07:30,571 --> 00:07:33,018
But, it's not enough.

124
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:36,127
Compared to what he did,
this is only the beginning.

125
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,872
I beg you, please stop.
How far do you want to go?

126
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,638
No matter what he did, the pain he's
suffering right now is enough.

127
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:46,577
Just that little pain, and you
can't watch any further?

128
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,279
That person...

129
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:52,364
has enjoyed what our parents
couldn't for the past 25 years.

130
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:56,185
Property, glory, he's taken it all.

131
00:07:57,653 --> 00:08:03,100
Now, even if he's on a wheelchair,
at least he won't be begging on the streets.

132
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,972
So, you hope the President dies?

133
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,388
Then, our dead parents can come back?

134
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,026
What is it that you want?

135
00:08:13,146 --> 00:08:16,664
The days you lost, you won't be able
to find them back through revenge.

136
00:08:16,784 --> 00:08:19,250
You will only lose more through
the process of your revenge!

137
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,016
Revenge is not about seeking out the past.

138
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:26,229
But it's the reason for my life now.

139
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:32,456
The reason why I'm living now,
is for Dad and Mom.

140
00:08:32,576 --> 00:08:36,370
No, more accurately,

141
00:08:38,587 --> 00:08:41,161
Look at us right now.

142
00:08:42,003 --> 00:08:48,152
You're being pursued for crimes,

143
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:53,620
and I can't even meet
the person that I love.

144
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,614
Is this the way our
parents wanted to see us?

145
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,551
<i>I beg you,</i>

146
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,572
if you want me to return as Kyeong Ran,

147
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:05,859
go look for Shin Hyun Woo
and beg for his forgiveness.

148
00:09:06,711 --> 00:09:08,136
<i>Then,</i>

149
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,923
I'll give up the marriage too.

150
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:22,360
What a fool.

151
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:31,739
I have no confidence to stay by your side,

152
00:09:32,036 --> 00:09:34,887
and no face to see the children.

153
00:09:36,151 --> 00:09:40,300
The day you're discharged, please let me go.

154
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:43,406
Where can you go?

155
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:50,581
I want you to stay by my side, and serve
me till the day my coffin lid is shut.

156
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:58,487
Is it because I'm an invalid,
that you want to abandon me?

157
00:09:59,785 --> 00:10:02,669
Just shout it out like you used to.

158
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,534
<i>Joo Seung is my child, and I turned
you into this, why are you so calm?</i>

159
00:10:07,654 --> 00:10:10,321
Hate me, scold me to your heart's content!

160
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,789
The way you are right now...

161
00:10:13,768 --> 00:10:18,184
it's making me so pressured,
I can't breathe!

162
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:19,780
<i>Honey.</i>

163
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,610
Joo Seung is your child,

164
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,908
I knew that a long time ago.

165
00:10:29,186 --> 00:10:30,348
What did you say?

166
00:10:30,468 --> 00:10:33,761
When I came back from business,

167
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:38,420
Secretary Nam told me that Joo Seung
was his child, and brought him to me.

168
00:10:41,363 --> 00:10:44,171
<i>But it was really strange.</i>

169
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:46,958
The minute I saw him,

170
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,937
I felt like he was my child.

171
00:10:56,342 --> 00:11:02,689
The child that my wife
gives birth is my child.

172
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,711
What other way can there be?

173
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,966
Honey.

174
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,434
<i>When I got up at night,</i>

175
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:14,869
and saw you crying at night,

176
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:20,911
the fact that I won't be
able to forgive you is true,

177
00:11:22,137 --> 00:11:27,244
but I really feel something
for that kid Joo Seung too.

178
00:11:29,201 --> 00:11:30,754
Ho...

179
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:32,999
Honey.

180
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:37,403
I'm wrong, honey.

181
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:44,522
I thought you would neglect
this crude and rough husband,

182
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:48,233
but looks like you hated me with a passion,

183
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:53,892
<i>and even had a son with Secretary
Nam who was closest to me,</i>

184
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:57,020
and took revenge on me.

185
00:11:57,735 --> 00:12:01,608
That's how much you hated me?

186
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:06,289
Why didn't you say anything?

187
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:10,356
Why didn't you tell me you knew everything?

188
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:16,378
I lived in fear that you
would find out every day,

189
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:19,782
it really wasn't a life at all.

190
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,845
If I told you I knew,

191
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:28,164
then you wouldn't be by my side.

192
00:12:28,284 --> 00:12:34,925
And, you would take Joo Seung,
to a place where I couldn't find you.

193
00:12:38,393 --> 00:12:43,472
The Joo Seung now, doesn't treat
us like parents but enemies.

194
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:47,983
<i>He wants to kill Hyun Woo,
and steal Hyun Woo's woman too.</i>

195
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:54,606
It's all because of me, the children I
birthed, are bleeding and battling.

196
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:58,526
This crime, how am I going to redeem myself,

197
00:12:58,646 --> 00:13:00,185
how?!

198
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:01,696
<i>How?!</i>

199
00:13:15,338 --> 00:13:18,763
Call an emergency meeting,
and call another credit bank.

200
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,574
No matter what, we have to
gather all our liquid assets,

201
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:22,338
and exchange it for an extended credit date.

202
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,979
Also, make an appointment with another bank.

203
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:29,447
After hearing what happened to the President,
the credit banks are getting uneasy.

204
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,809
We have to do all we can.

205
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:33,702
Do as I tell you.

206
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:48,334
The creditors' response seems
to be pretty favorable.

207
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:51,174
- Have you contacted the bank yet?
- Yes.

208
00:13:54,663 --> 00:13:56,854
This is Shin Hyun Woo.

209
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:57,839
Yes?

210
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:00,013
The police station?

211
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,096
Shin Hyun Woo, you said
that your wife Joo Ah Ran,

212
00:14:03,115 --> 00:14:07,200
wanted to kill her paralyzed
husband, so she set the fire.

213
00:14:07,955 --> 00:14:09,530
Yes, that's true.

214
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,891
Then, who is the Shin Hyun Woo
who is sitting in front of me right now?

215
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:16,618
In your vegetative state,
how did you escape the fire?

216
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:20,487
And looking at the evidence that
the Yang Pyeong police just sent over,

217
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:26,551
there was a silicone wig found in the villa.

218
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:30,572
Does that mean, you pretended
you were in a vegetative state?

219
00:14:34,755 --> 00:14:38,181
The fact that I woke up,
Joo Ah Ran was aware of this.

220
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:42,709
That's why she locked all the doors
from outside, and turned the gas on.

221
00:14:42,829 --> 00:14:47,390
First of all, we will cooperate with the
Yang Pyeong villa to investigate this case,

222
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,411
<i>and we also have to find hard
evidence that Joo Ah Ran is a criminal.</i>

223
00:14:50,531 --> 00:14:51,850
I will cooperate with you.

224
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:52,724
Oh, right.

225
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,552
According to Joo Ah Ran's statement,

226
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:57,723
Shin Hyun Woo, you used Ahn Jae
Sung's name to work before.

227
00:14:57,843 --> 00:15:01,808
You do realize that constitutes
identity theft and fraud, right?

228
00:15:17,992 --> 00:15:22,524
<i>You're under investigation
so early in the morning.</i>

229
00:15:23,308 --> 00:15:27,244
Ah Ran and I, will definitely
not die by ourselves.

230
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:32,095
No matter what, we will catch Hyung and President
by the throats, and fall in the water together.

231
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:33,670
What?

232
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,700
You despicable person.

233
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,788
Father is still lying in
the hospital from his accident,

234
00:15:38,908 --> 00:15:43,640
<i>and you want to play this jealous game,
because your mother got snatched away?</i>

235
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,831
What?

236
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:47,363
President...

237
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:48,725
traffic accident?

238
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,775
Why? When?

239
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,520
Listen carefully.

240
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,903
The crimes that I committed under Ahn Jae Sung,
I'm ready to accept punishment for them.

241
00:15:57,023 --> 00:16:00,413
I won't negotiate with people
like you in order to avoid this crime.

242
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:01,980
<i>Joo Ah Ran and you,</i>

243
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,235
I'll make you stand in front of the judges.

244
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:13,561
President...

245
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:17,208
He was in a traffic accident?

246
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,498
<i>We don't need to say anything else.</i>

247
00:16:19,618 --> 00:16:21,412
Look at this photograph,

248
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:23,075
and if you still want to marry that person,

249
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,671
we won't stop you.

250
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,143
Dad.

251
00:16:40,973 --> 00:16:41,888
Mom.

252
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:50,854
Aigoo. When they were children,
Ah Ran and Kyeong Ran were so close.

253
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:54,184
<i>They never fought,</i>

254
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:59,152
<i>and Ah Ran took care of Kyeong Ran
like a mother, wasn't that right?</i>

255
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,025
That's right.

256
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:07,087
Blood is thicker than water, how could
Kyeong Ran not take care of her family?

257
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:11,441
<i>Then, is she a beast or a human?</i>

258
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:14,667
So, my dad and mom looks like that.

259
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:17,135
Eyes,

260
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,487
<i>nose,</i>

261
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:20,891
mouth,

262
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:23,997
is so similar to mine.

263
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,876
How could I have lived till now,
without knowing?

264
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:41,758
Actually, your father, is a person
whose fingernail doesn't even look like mine.

265
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:45,929
He was so proper, as a President.

266
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:47,801
Oh, my Hyung.

267
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,083
Aigoo, looking at this,
I should have died first.

268
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:56,402
What are you saying?

269
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:59,378
<i>If you left, how would I survive?</i>

270
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:00,973
Kyeong Ran,

271
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:06,463
on behalf of your parents,
you can't forget your sister either.

272
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:12,126
If you listen to me, from now on,
you have to live differently from before.

273
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:16,239
<i>The furniture, the showroom,
I'm not asking for anything.</i>

274
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:18,983
This person,
did you drink too much?

275
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:23,143
Since we're born onto this earth,
we have to live like people.

276
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:52,603
These people...

277
00:18:56,688 --> 00:19:00,242
Where has everyone gone,
leaving the patient alone?

278
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:06,145
I don't wish to talk to you.
You get out of here immediately.

279
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:10,193
Even so, you can't abuse
someone who came to visit you.

280
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:16,778
It was a little inappropriate to come
empty-handed, so I bought some flowers.

281
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:19,310
I'm sorry you're in this state.

282
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:23,611
What are you trying to do now?

283
00:19:24,526 --> 00:19:28,207
Why did Joo Chul Min's
family come to visit me?

284
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,114
Didn't you hear me when I said to get out?

285
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:36,022
I heard you were paralyzed from the waist down,
but your temper hasn't changed a bit.

286
00:19:36,431 --> 00:19:42,033
But don't misunderstand,
that you can cover your past.

287
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:43,263
Ah Ran.

288
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,497
What?

289
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,518
Who's paralyzed from the waist down?

290
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:51,697
You still don't know?

291
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:58,994
What you did 25 years ago,
how it has come back to you?

292
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,269
What is going on?

293
00:20:08,025 --> 00:20:10,089
What is going on?

294
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:12,727
Who turned my legs into such a state?

295
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,387
Was it you?!

296
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,103
<i>My...</i>

297
00:20:17,223 --> 00:20:18,826
<i>My legs!</i>

298
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,890
Your shadow won't grow longer anymore.

299
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,294
How much of your assets you
have gained by underhand methods,

300
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,654
is how deep the evidence of your crimes.

301
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,462
Father, what is going on?

302
00:20:33,582 --> 00:20:35,377
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

303
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:37,645
Do you not know Father's
condition right now?

304
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:41,368
Who did something to my body?

305
00:20:41,488 --> 00:20:44,596
Return it to me!

306
00:20:44,716 --> 00:20:45,891
I can't live like this!

307
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:50,954
You should have just let me die on the bed,
why did you save me?!

308
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:52,415
<i>Honey!</i>

309
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:57,045
Just blame me, I thought
you would feel better.

310
00:20:57,165 --> 00:20:59,045
Who wants to die?

311
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:04,086
you have to hang on
all the way till the end.

312
00:21:04,206 --> 00:21:06,852
<i>President has to spend
his entire life on a wheelchair,</i>

313
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:09,661
<i>to redeem the crime
of killing Ah Ran's parents.</i>

314
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:12,970
<i>Madam, you have to push President
in a wheelchair your entire life,</i>

315
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,962
<i>to redeem the crime of abandoning me.</i>

316
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,547
Get out now.

317
00:21:21,654 --> 00:21:24,256
I don't want to see you.

318
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,703
Disappear!

319
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:36,720
Stop being so petulant.

320
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,061
Were you the only one on this earth who
was abandoned by your parents?!

321
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:46,065
At least you still had your father,
and had such a good education.

322
00:21:46,185 --> 00:21:48,427
Even if a bad seed was planted,

323
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:51,682
a child who would pull a
knife against his mother,

324
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:53,086
there is none in the world.

325
00:21:53,206 --> 00:21:54,597
Let me go!

326
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:58,880
Do you think I'm pushing the
blame because I didn't get a toy?!

327
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,582
I, wasn't abandoned,
but brutally killed.

328
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:07,828
but brutally killed. At least, Madam
killed me brutally countless times in her dreams.

329
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:11,233
<i>I lived like this my entire life,
walking around as a ticking bomb,</i>

330
00:22:11,353 --> 00:22:15,116
how much anger and unease
she must have felt.

331
00:22:15,236 --> 00:22:17,329
The feeling of being pushed
away by your mother,

332
00:22:17,733 --> 00:22:19,606
does Hyung know?

333
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:24,648
Joo Seung, your hate,

334
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,122
I'll help you unleash it.

335
00:22:31,122 --> 00:22:33,548
This is Soul's last check.

336
00:22:33,668 --> 00:22:35,942
<i>You personally hand out the last invoice.</i>

337
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:41,045
If you can't get it paid by today,
Soul will be bankrupt.

338
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,492
Joo Ah Ran.

339
00:22:44,612 --> 00:22:46,390
What are you going to do?

340
00:22:47,071 --> 00:22:51,283
I want to give you the chance
to push Soul down.

341
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,985
I understand.

342
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:56,318
I'll do it.

343
00:22:58,616 --> 00:22:59,786
All right.

344
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,084
You want to fight to the end, right?

345
00:23:04,627 --> 00:23:06,499
Then I have no choice.

346
00:23:07,648 --> 00:23:12,223
I delayed time, to give you and
Jae Hee time to reconcile.

347
00:23:12,343 --> 00:23:14,861
Looks like there isn't a need.

348
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,439
The black box in the car,

349
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:26,856
and the fingerprints from
the Yang Pyeong villa are in here.

350
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:32,175
As long as I turn this to the police,
the two of you are over.

351
00:23:34,877 --> 00:23:36,728
All right, go ahead,

352
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:42,643
I think you want to give the President
in a wheelchair a last present.

353
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:44,090
We'll do as you wish.

354
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,920
<i>Stop it.</i>

355
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:48,282
I'll just go die.

356
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:50,452
Stop all this revenge!

357
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:54,388
The children I gave birth to,
are biting at each other and arguing,

358
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:56,665
I can't watch this anymore.

359
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:58,634
This isn't life, this is hell!

360
00:23:58,754 --> 00:24:00,379
<i>This hell!</i>

361
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:03,762
Was created by President and Madam.

362
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:11,471
I will always help Ah Ran, to redeem all the
crimes President committed 25 years ago.

363
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,895
Mother.
Mother!

364
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:21,450
It's time to go for a checkup,
I'll bring you over in a wheelchair!

365
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:23,918
Don't help me!

366
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,641
I can do this.

367
00:25:28,296 --> 00:25:33,062
Do you think, that I can't
even move my own body?

368
00:25:33,402 --> 00:25:36,551
Don't look down on Shin Woo Sub!

369
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,385
- Are you fine?
- Let me go!

370
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:52,565
I can do this.

371
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:55,033
I can do this.

372
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,076
I can walk.

373
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,685
What happened?

374
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:19,557
Didn't you say that there
weren't any more invoices to pay?

375
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,457
It's an invoice that Joo Ah Ran filled, selling
furniture to other companies at lowered costs.

376
00:26:25,577 --> 00:26:27,733
The cost is about 13 hundred million.

377
00:26:30,312 --> 00:26:32,903
The bank can't help us anymore.

378
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:38,565
Oh right, a letter came for
President Shin Hyun Woo this afternoon.

379
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,615
<i>Ahjusshi,</i>

380
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:53,870
<i>even though I want to deny it,</i>

381
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,095
<i>I can't help the fact
that I am Joo Kyeong Ran.</i>

382
00:26:58,351 --> 00:27:02,989
<i>At this moment, I feel
like I understand my Unnie.</i>

383
00:27:03,797 --> 00:27:09,364
<i>Even if I start my life anew now,
I might become like her.</i>

384
00:27:10,704 --> 00:27:15,082
<i>Please, forgive all the crimes
my Unnie committed.</i>

385
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:22,189
<i>The period where I loved Ahjusshi,
I was really happy.</i>

386
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,442
This...

387
00:27:48,044 --> 00:27:49,831
is Kyeong Ran's shoes.

388
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,576
Why did Kyeong Ran give these to me?

389
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:59,326
Maybe she means she
doesn't want to come back.

390
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:03,687
Does that mean she chose Shin Hyun Woo?

391
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:14,151
Kyeong Ran was my last hope.

392
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,757
In the end, this dream too,
was cruelly crushed by them.

393
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:23,736
Now, there's no reason to hold back.

394
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:28,481
Send the invoice over,
and bankrupt Soul.

395
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:33,387
Open the door.

396
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:34,897
I know you're in there,

397
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,748
I have something to ask,
open the door!

398
00:28:40,878 --> 00:28:43,835
After we told him we were going to
send the invoice, he seems pretty desperate.

399
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:52,463
<i>Madam.</i>

400
00:29:02,661 --> 00:29:04,959
Is there anything else to say?

401
00:29:07,895 --> 00:29:11,357
That invoice, do you
really have to change it?

402
00:29:12,187 --> 00:29:14,762
Do you really have to bankrupt Soul?

403
00:29:15,783 --> 00:29:19,613
In the end, you came to
beg me for the company.

404
00:29:19,733 --> 00:29:23,589
On my behalf, couldn't you just
tolerate it one more time?

405
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:26,163
<i>No matter what, to Hyun Woo,
and Hyun Woo's father,</i>

406
00:29:26,283 --> 00:29:29,163
Soul is something very important.

407
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:33,157
I beg you, please, Joo Seung.

408
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:35,391
Hyun Woo,

409
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,179
Hyun Woo,

410
00:29:37,966 --> 00:29:38,944
Hyun Woo.

411
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:43,181
When are you going to
stop talking about Hyun Woo?!

412
00:29:43,606 --> 00:29:45,989
<i>I'm also a child that you birthed painfully.</i>

413
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:50,436
Why am I not worth the dust
on Hyun Woo Hyung's fingernails?

414
00:29:50,883 --> 00:29:53,880
Why can't you see the metal
stake that is pierced through my heart?

415
00:29:56,391 --> 00:29:58,412
It's all right how much you hate me.

416
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,636
As long as you let Soul go,

417
00:30:00,756 --> 00:30:04,785
I can tolerate it, even if you throw
rocks at me, or step on me.

418
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:09,248
You might as well just kill me here,
just don't touch the other family members.

419
00:30:09,368 --> 00:30:11,567
You mean that because of Hyun Woo,

420
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,971
you can sacrifice anything?

421
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:18,140
That means, that I can't agree to it.

422
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:24,428
Hyun Woo, I must see the way
he kneels in front of me and begs me.

423
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,950
There is something you don't know!

424
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:33,434
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,
wasn't Hyun Woo's father, but me.

425
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:40,123
What?

426
00:30:40,243 --> 00:30:43,974
Ah Ran's parents' accident,
was caused by me.

427
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:46,381
The person who loosened the screws was me,

428
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:50,062
and the person who ran away when
the Manager sat on the forklift was also me.

429
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,849
I killed him.

430
00:30:51,969 --> 00:30:54,041
I planned all of it.

431
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:56,241
Stop lying.

432
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,433
What reason would you
have to kill Ah Ran's parents?

433
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:04,582
You wanted to pin the President's crime
on your head, that's why you said that, right?

434
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:06,493
Ah Ran's father,

435
00:31:07,004 --> 00:31:09,855
knew about the relationship
between me and your father.

436
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:12,461
He coincidentally heard that
we had a special relationship,

437
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:15,642
and even had a child.

438
00:31:16,662 --> 00:31:20,619
Ah Ran's father was fighting with Hyun Woo's
father every day, because of poor materials.

439
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:26,005
I was afraid, he would spill
my secret in the end.

440
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:28,899
So you killed the factory manager?

441
00:31:29,324 --> 00:31:31,792
Are you expecting me to
believe this right now?

442
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,197
Your deceased father,

443
00:31:35,324 --> 00:31:37,378
knew this too.

444
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,506
What?

445
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,889
After he found out that
I killed Ah Ran's parents,

446
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,602
he felt very guilty,

447
00:31:48,495 --> 00:31:51,091
that's why,

448
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:53,951
he asked you to take care
of Ah Ran after his death.

449
00:31:58,748 --> 00:31:59,759
No.

450
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,855
Now you know?

451
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,137
The person that Ah Ran needs to seek revenge
on isn't Hyun Woo, or Hyun Woo's father, but me.

452
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:11,839
The mother that gave birth to you.

453
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:12,882
No,

454
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:15,329
no,

455
00:32:16,882 --> 00:32:17,797
no!

456
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:20,742
I handed over Kyeong Ran to the orphanage,

457
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:23,955
because I felt guilty
about killing her parents.

458
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:27,317
Because I felt guilty
for destroying a family,

459
00:32:27,742 --> 00:32:30,189
I've never had a peaceful day.

460
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:35,380
Stop lying.

461
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:38,890
It's not possible.

462
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,724
Don't even say another word!

463
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,323
<i>But Hyun Woo Hyung isn't guilty.</i>

464
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,632
Being born by such parents is a crime.

465
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,589
When I was serving alcohol to old men,

466
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:43,221
that man, should have been
sleeping in a comfortable house.

467
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:48,179
Let the forgiving words be
carried away by dogs.

468
00:34:15,131 --> 00:34:16,365
Joo Ah Ran.

469
00:34:16,939 --> 00:34:18,514
Don't resent me.

470
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,939
The crimes you committed will be punished.

471
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:25,221
I've always hesitated because you were
the sister that Kyeong Ran missed,

472
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:30,647
but you've pushed me to the end,
there's nothing else to hold on to.

473
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:41,156
What?

474
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,475
Mother was the one who
tampered with the forklift?

475
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:46,954
Could it be...

476
00:34:47,074 --> 00:34:48,634
It's true.

477
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:53,571
I was afraid my past would be exposed,

478
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:56,188
so I killed Ah Ran's father.

479
00:34:56,308 --> 00:34:58,954
Besides killing him, I didn't know any
other way I could shut his mouth.

480
00:34:59,074 --> 00:35:00,847
That can't be.

481
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,130
How could such a soft-hearted
person like Mom...

482
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,854
I wasn't myself then.

483
00:35:07,296 --> 00:35:10,880
I could only think of saving Joo Seung.

484
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,859
If your father knew...

485
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:19,146
I thought he would kill Joo Seung.

486
00:35:21,103 --> 00:35:22,954
Then in the end,

487
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:26,103
Joo Ah Ran was right?

488
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,729
<i>Our family to Joo Ah Ran,</i>

489
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:32,368
is an enemy that can't even be revenged?

490
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:34,453
My mother,

491
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,403
because she was afraid her
own family would be split apart,

492
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:41,467
was someone who destroyed
someone else's family, is that it?

493
00:35:42,148 --> 00:35:43,595
I'm sorry.

494
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:46,552
Can you use sorry to forget everything?

495
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,101
Two innocent people died,

496
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:55,942
and two children were orphaned Jae Hee's
parents who died, not even knowing the reason,

497
00:35:56,062 --> 00:35:59,955
and the pain that Joo Ah Ran
and Jae Hee suffered for 25 years,

498
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,736
how are you going to repay that?

499
00:36:02,856 --> 00:36:05,254
How are you going to redeem yourself?

500
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:10,258
What do you want me to do, you tell me.

501
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:13,022
<i>I don't even have the right to die now.</i>

502
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:18,345
Turning your father into this state,
where else can I hide?

503
00:36:18,465 --> 00:36:20,934
Why did you do that?

504
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,595
My mother,

505
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,042
how could she do something so scary?

506
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:30,149
I know I have no right to say this to you,

507
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,187
but, can you let Ah Ran go?

508
00:36:37,017 --> 00:36:40,443
Then, what would my life become?

509
00:36:41,804 --> 00:36:43,932
The pain of dying,

510
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:46,671
<i>the pain of plastic surgery,</i>

511
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:50,245
was all for putting my
life on the line for revenge.

512
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,054
Now for Mother, you want
me to put everything away?

513
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,952
I can't do that.

514
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,114
Mother's crime, you take
on the responsibility.

515
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:09,642
Don't take your heinous crimes,
and leave any of it for your children.

516
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:13,950
I'll do whatever I wish to do.

517
00:37:53,643 --> 00:37:55,956
I want to hand over concrete
evidence of the traffic accident

518
00:37:56,076 --> 00:37:59,281
and the fire at the Yang
Pyeong villa to you, Officer.

519
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:00,731
If you look at this,

520
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:04,628
you will know who the two
people who committed the crimes are.

521
00:38:04,748 --> 00:38:06,567
Concrete evidence?

522
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:09,076
What is it?

523
00:38:17,692 --> 00:38:20,872
Mother killed that woman's parents.

524
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:25,178
Now, how am I going to punish that woman?

525
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,055
Pulling out a knife against Joo Ah Ran,

526
00:38:29,175 --> 00:38:32,209
is equivalent to pulling
out a knife against Mother.

527
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,255
<i>Nam Joo Seung.</i>

528
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,005
Hyung, you know too?

529
00:39:07,666 --> 00:39:11,517
The criminal 25 years ago, was Madam.

530
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:13,520
What do you want to say?

531
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,354
Was it,

532
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:19,126
Hyung who asked Madam to come look for me?

533
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:23,636
You thought if I knew my mother did it,

534
00:39:24,104 --> 00:39:25,959
everything would become ugly?

535
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,323
What?

536
00:39:27,749 --> 00:39:30,840
Don't have any hopes for me.

537
00:39:31,194 --> 00:39:35,180
No matter what, I was a beast my
mother refused to acknowledge.

538
00:39:35,713 --> 00:39:38,249
Now, or in the future,

539
00:39:39,224 --> 00:39:41,844
I'll make any decisions for me and Ah Ran.

540
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:45,403
I came to say all this.

541
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:48,992
Saying that, does your heart feel better?

542
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,979
Looks like you don't want to acknowledge
your mother, and stay by the woman you love

543
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:56,892
That doesn't change anything at all.

544
00:39:57,176 --> 00:40:00,272
You're the son of Jo Kyung Hee,
who killed Joo Ah Ran's parents.

545
00:40:03,352 --> 00:40:05,467
Hyung, you're the same too.

546
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:08,686
Didn't you overlook the
enmity between both our families,

547
00:40:09,773 --> 00:40:11,904
and love Yoon Jae Hee?

548
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:14,504
But, at least I'm not denying the past.

549
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,758
I'll beg Jae Hee to forgive Mom.

550
00:40:19,994 --> 00:40:22,701
Till my hands are scraped raw,

551
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:26,330
till my kneecaps are begged through,
till the day my heart stops,

552
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:29,719
I'll beg for Jae Hee's forgiveness.

553
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:35,810
Isn't that the last thing
I can do for the woman I love?

554
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:37,260
No.

555
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,329
I won't tell Ah Ran anything.

556
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:42,993
From the beginning she wasn't my mother.

557
00:40:43,446 --> 00:40:48,476
Now she says she's my mother
and wants me to carry around such shame.

558
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:51,012
<i>Isn't that too despicable?</i>

559
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:54,337
The good days are over.

560
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:58,184
Why is she coming back as a criminal?

561
00:40:58,304 --> 00:41:01,706
Even though we can't
overlook Mother's crimes,

562
00:41:01,826 --> 00:41:04,754
but, you can't accuse Mother.

563
00:41:04,874 --> 00:41:09,840
The choice that Mother made then,
was because of you.

564
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,952
Stop saying such irresponsible things.

565
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,851
In order to keep the secret from Dad,

566
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,112
she did such a horrible thing
to Ah Ran's parents.

567
00:41:19,232 --> 00:41:21,756
<i>To prevent her child from
being swallowed alive,</i>

568
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:24,335
she went to bite other people's children.

569
00:41:24,455 --> 00:41:27,169
That was only a choice Madam made.

570
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:29,735
I didn't do anything.

571
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,653
I'm clean.

572
00:41:31,773 --> 00:41:35,469
I don't wish, because of Madam,
to become a criminal.

573
00:41:40,979 --> 00:41:43,750
This is Ah Ran's last invoice.

574
00:41:44,133 --> 00:41:48,119
I'm going to change this invoice right now.

575
00:41:48,844 --> 00:41:53,200
What Ah Ran hopes for,
is what I hope for.

576
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,997
Are you ready?

577
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:25,555
<i>You are the son of Jo Kyung Hee,
who killed Joo Ah Ran's parents.</i>

578
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,795
Yes.

579
00:42:28,915 --> 00:42:31,221
Wait till the bank is
closing before doing it.

580
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,758
Then, Shin Hyun Woo will have no way either.

581
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:36,379
That's right.

582
00:42:36,499 --> 00:42:39,172
When is the real Ahn Jae Sung coming?

583
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:41,431
He'll get here on the first plane tomorrow.

584
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,163
No matter what,
we have to get him on our side.

585
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:50,256
We have to paralyze Shin Hyun
Woo with the crime of identity theft.

586
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:09,436
Do it slowly.

587
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:12,249
If you do it so diligently,
I'm going to get fired.

588
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:14,181
If I stop I'll think of other things.

589
00:43:14,301 --> 00:43:18,444
I'll prepare it, and clean the rooms,
you just rest.

590
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,404
I'm really comfortable,

591
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:24,161
but why would you come to Nun Island?

592
00:43:24,864 --> 00:43:27,507
No, I just came to clear my head.

593
00:43:27,627 --> 00:43:32,537
The view here is good, so is that air,
I really made the right choice.

594
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:36,630
All the unhappy things,
seem to have ended up on the beach.

595
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:41,660
There is no hate, no dissent,

596
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:44,431
and there's no need to fight,

597
00:43:45,251 --> 00:43:46,935
it's comfortable here.

598
00:43:53,223 --> 00:43:54,523
<i>Ahjusshi,</i>

599
00:43:54,643 --> 00:43:57,501
<i>you have to be strong.</i>

600
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:03,128
<i>I'll miss Ahjusshi, but I'll hold it in.</i>

601
00:44:03,248 --> 00:44:08,475
<i>But, I'm worried,
that Ahjusshi will be tired.</i>

602
00:44:18,902 --> 00:44:22,291
President, the last invoice just came in.

603
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,040
There's not much time to settle it.

604
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:29,175
Don't say anything to my father.

605
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:32,990
But tomorrow's papers,
will definitely publish that we're bankrupt.

606
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,218
Hurry and do it.

607
00:44:37,078 --> 00:44:39,763
Just follow this and publish it.

608
00:44:43,822 --> 00:44:44,973
No... what?

609
00:44:45,093 --> 00:44:49,790
Don't tell any of the stockholders,
just you, Secretary Kang, and I will know

610
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:51,704
Go gather the legal personnel immediately.

611
00:44:51,824 --> 00:44:53,473
I understand, President.

612
00:44:57,885 --> 00:45:02,084
Thank you, Nam Joo Seung,
for giving me courage.

613
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:08,287
I don't know why I've
lived so diligently until now,

614
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:11,987
running around so tirelessly to earn money,

615
00:45:12,456 --> 00:45:16,375
I thought everything would
be good as long as I had money.

616
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,491
But now, I would return that money,
hundred-fold, thousand-fold,

617
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:26,438
as long as I can get my
two legs back to walk.

618
00:45:28,165 --> 00:45:30,701
<i>I really deserved it.</i>

619
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:35,284
Not being able to go to school, and being
unknowledgeable was always a regret of mine.

620
00:45:35,729 --> 00:45:39,118
So I only knew how to hit
and torture my family members.

621
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:42,550
Now, I'm getting punished.

622
00:45:44,042 --> 00:45:46,024
Don't say things like that.

623
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,660
<i>Think about it.</i>

624
00:45:48,981 --> 00:45:52,307
The crimes I committed
aren't just one or two.

625
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:54,992
When Ah Ran's parents died,

626
00:45:55,112 --> 00:46:00,879
I was greedy for that compensation,
so I made a fake check.

627
00:46:00,999 --> 00:46:03,960
I forced them to sign a fake agreement,

628
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:07,029
I've done a lot of things
against my conscience.

629
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:14,183
<i>Importing inadequate material, turning them
into high end furniture and then selling them,</i>

630
00:46:14,303 --> 00:46:18,544
making double account
books and evading taxes,

631
00:46:19,035 --> 00:46:22,285
my life is really interesting.

632
00:46:25,034 --> 00:46:28,994
At first I could die, but I'm alive.

633
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,829
In the future,

634
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,868
I should do everything I haven't done.

635
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:37,874
<i>Honey,</i>

636
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:41,894
<i>I'm the worst mother in this world.</i>

637
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:46,776
<i>It was me that killed the
parents of the sons' greatest love,</i>

638
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,526
<i>and turned them into enemies.</i>

639
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:10,605
I called you because there was something up.

640
00:47:12,502 --> 00:47:18,596
After I get discharged, I want to
officially accept you into my family as a son.

641
00:47:19,193 --> 00:47:20,322
But,

642
00:47:21,324 --> 00:47:23,818
you have to break up with Joo Ah Ran.

643
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:25,907
I can't do that.

644
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:28,145
You have to do so.

645
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,013
Although I knew my best friend, your father,

646
00:47:31,133 --> 00:47:33,976
and my wife betrayed me at the same time,

647
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:39,262
I never asked why Secretary
Nam did that till the day he died.

648
00:47:40,003 --> 00:47:42,667
Because, I took you as my own child.

649
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,733
You know I'm Madam's son?

650
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:53,031
I'm not an idiot,

651
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:55,503
how could I not know?

652
00:47:55,972 --> 00:48:01,210
But I didn't treat you differently
from Hyun Woo and Hyun Min.

653
00:48:01,573 --> 00:48:06,219
Because, among my sons, you're most like me.

654
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:08,185
What's the use of saying this now?

655
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:15,518
If you knew everything from the beginning,
why didn't you say so?

656
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:20,932
Then Madam wouldn't have
to hide anything either.

657
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,683
I'm regretful that I didn't
work up the courage earlier too.

658
00:48:27,605 --> 00:48:31,506
This is the title deed that was placed
in your name not long ago.

659
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:34,596
No matter how difficult
the company's situation was,

660
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:40,020
I never wanted to touch it, not once.

661
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:43,217
You settle what is yours.

662
00:48:43,771 --> 00:48:46,286
It's cold. Let's go in.

663
00:49:05,863 --> 00:49:09,486
President, dropped this.

664
00:49:12,286 --> 00:49:13,245
Then.

665
00:49:36,492 --> 00:49:39,582
<i>Since you made it to medical school,
you can be a doctor.</i>

666
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,388
<i>Good job, good job!</i>

667
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:45,246
<i>Once you graduate,
I'll build you a big hospital.</i>

668
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,383
Jae Hee, where are you?

669
00:50:08,408 --> 00:50:10,795
What can I do for you?

670
00:50:12,486 --> 00:50:15,427
I really really miss you,

671
00:50:15,547 --> 00:50:17,942
and I'm so guilty I'm going crazy.

672
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:32,725
You don't care if the company goes bankrupt,

673
00:50:32,845 --> 00:50:35,435
and you only care about your love life?

674
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:37,630
Jae Hee left,

675
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:41,382
and she even emptied her house.

676
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,428
What?

677
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,195
Where did she go?
When?!

678
00:50:48,602 --> 00:50:50,307
I don't know either.

679
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:53,099
No matter as Yoon Jae Hee or Joo Kyeong Ran,

680
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:55,129
she's had a tiring life.

681
00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:57,922
This is all because of you!

682
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:02,398
I looked so hard for her, what is
going to happen if I never find her again?!

683
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:04,734
It's not enough to snatch my parents away,

684
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:07,590
now you want to steal my sister too?!

685
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:11,725
This never ending battle,
when is it ever going to finish?

686
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,135
Are you asking because you don't know?

687
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,288
Till either you or me,

688
00:51:20,055 --> 00:51:22,613
when either one of us
has absolutely nothing.

689
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:52,809
<i>Soul Furniture,
announces bankruptcy for the first time.</i>

690
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:09,140
Director, it's Jae Hee.

691
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:12,956
Is it true that Soul Furniture is bankrupt?

692
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:14,703
They are bankrupt.

693
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:17,650
But what is scarier, is that Teacher
Shin stole someone else's identity,

694
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:19,547
and is being investigated for fraud.

695
00:52:19,667 --> 00:52:23,405
The Jae Sung from England
is coming back today, Jae Hee.

696
00:52:23,525 --> 00:52:25,067
Jae Sung,

697
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:26,915
Ahn Jae Sung Oppa?!

698
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:32,244
This is the title deed that
your father gave to Joo Seung.

699
00:52:32,364 --> 00:52:34,759
Sell it and use it to
pay off the debts first.

700
00:52:34,879 --> 00:52:37,507
If we can't stop it today,
we'll become bankrupt.

701
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:40,299
No.

702
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:44,989
This is the share that
Dad left to Joo Seung.

703
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:48,044
I don't wish to keep Soul
using underhand methods.

704
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:52,392
Today, I'll handle all of
the stocks under my name in Soul.

705
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:56,165
What does that mean?
Won't you lose ownership then?

706
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:58,959
Compared to ownership, it's more
important to save the company first.

707
00:53:06,824 --> 00:53:07,829
What?

708
00:53:08,234 --> 00:53:10,579
Jae Hee contacted you?!

709
00:53:11,943 --> 00:53:14,500
Now, you're going to pick up
Ahn Jae Sung from the airport, right?

710
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,414
I'll take him to the station
to get his statement done immediately.

711
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:18,447
It'll make everything
easier and better for us.

712
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:23,256
He's also from the orphanage, keeping him away
from Jae Hee, might be beneficial to us.

713
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:27,424
I'll wait for you in front
of the police station.

714
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:32,710
But, the police station is too quiet,
it makes me nervous.

715
00:53:33,754 --> 00:53:36,567
We sent the invoice back, but there's been no
movement for Shin Hyun Woo, I think it's strange.

716
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,200
Shin Hyun Woo isn't doing
anything, like a cripple.

717
00:53:41,755 --> 00:53:44,824
He's been stabbed in the back
by the person he loves the most.

718
00:53:44,944 --> 00:53:47,179
Let's go, we're going to be late.

719
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:02,696
Ahjusshi, has the boat to Nun Island left?

720
00:54:02,816 --> 00:54:04,764
It just left.

721
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,700
Ahjusshi.

722
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:25,940
Jae Hee.

723
00:54:38,935 --> 00:54:41,556
Ahjusshi, how can you be here right now?

724
00:54:41,676 --> 00:54:44,007
What can we do about the bankruptcy?

725
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:48,142
Why are you not handling the company matters,
what am I that you are coming to look for me?

726
00:54:48,262 --> 00:54:50,700
Without Jae Hee, I can't do anything.

727
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,374
Everything I do, I think
about Jae Hee all the time.

728
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:57,424
I'm worried I won't be able
to see you for the rest of my life.

729
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:00,919
We don't have time to do this right now.

730
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,008
Today, Ahn Jae Sung Oppa
is coming back from England.

731
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:04,896
<i>The real Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

732
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:09,713
Joo Ah Ran wants to convict Ahjusshi for fraud,
that's why they called Oppa.

733
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,120
Let's go.

734
00:55:16,781 --> 00:55:18,551
Yeon Jae, you know how to knit?

735
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,959
I told you everything that
requires my head I can't do,

736
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:23,879
but everything to do with my hands, I do.

737
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:27,760
I'm knitting a carpet to put on Father's
knees when he's sitting on the wheelchair.

738
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,192
To make Father a little happier,
should I add a little pattern?

739
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:32,812
Thank you.

740
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,059
How could you have such adorable ideas?

741
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:39,811
If you have wishes, you have to act
in order for them to come true.

742
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:45,118
Suddenly, such an awful person appears
and demands his son, would he give him up?

743
00:55:45,877 --> 00:55:48,094
Am I that good?

744
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:49,788
Besides having the fortune
of having wealthy parents

745
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:52,090
and letting Yeon Jae live
a little more comfortably,

746
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,219
I don't have any other good points.

747
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,864
Even during the college exams, I couldn't
get into a college, that's why I went to America.

748
00:55:57,984 --> 00:55:59,590
What is this, what is this,

749
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,766
I knew you had a slow brain,
but I didn't think you had stones for brains.

750
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:05,892
It's totally destroyed, totally destroyed.

751
00:56:07,086 --> 00:56:11,370
When we get married and have children, they'll
definitely be the first in the entire country.

752
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,841
You think that's easy?

753
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:14,939
It won't be easy having
a child that's the best.

754
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:25,744
Yeon Jae, let's, get married at Christmas.

755
00:56:26,128 --> 00:56:27,953
<i>That was originally the date
Hyung was supposed to get married,</i>

756
00:56:28,073 --> 00:56:30,596
since it's reserved already,
let's just do it.

757
00:56:31,662 --> 00:56:36,116
I want Yeon Jae to enter the family earlier,
so our family can be happier.

758
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,665
Christmas?

759
00:56:40,221 --> 00:56:42,503
Ahn Jae Sung, when you were in England,

760
00:56:42,623 --> 00:56:45,828
did you know your identity had been stolen?

761
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:50,112
Right, do you know the Shin Hyun Woo here?

762
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,648
Shin Hyun Woo,

763
00:56:54,264 --> 00:56:57,483
is our company's Korean representative.

764
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:00,914
No.

765
00:57:02,236 --> 00:57:03,621
He's lying.

766
00:57:03,741 --> 00:57:06,577
I'm the representative of the
English company, ROBBINS.

767
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:11,714
Not long ago, when we picked a Korean
representative, we picked Shin Hyun Woo.

768
00:57:16,348 --> 00:57:18,202
That can't be.

769
00:57:18,607 --> 00:57:23,523
ROBBINS is an imaginary company
that Shin Hyun Woo used for revenge.

770
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:26,485
Did you talk to Yoon Jae Hee before this?

771
00:57:26,605 --> 00:57:29,987
Nam Joo Seung, please sit down.

772
00:57:30,107 --> 00:57:32,097
I thought this could be of use,

773
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:35,720
so I brought the legal
documents for ROBBINS.

774
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:37,127
These,

775
00:57:37,247 --> 00:57:41,502
are all the documents that show that contracts
in Korea that have been handed to Shin Hyun Woo.

776
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,340
After I've looked through the documents
and completed my investigation,

777
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,962
we'll listen to both sides.

778
00:58:03,432 --> 00:58:05,265
What happened?

779
00:58:05,564 --> 00:58:08,782
Did the real Ahn Jae Sung say everything?

780
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:13,574
The fact that his real name has been stolen,
he wouldn't remain unmoved, right?

781
00:58:16,728 --> 00:58:19,052
You seem curious, so I'll tell you.

782
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:23,455
Ahn Jae Sung is the legal
representative for ROBBINS in England.

783
00:58:23,575 --> 00:58:27,057
Hyun Woo, is the Korean
legal representative.

784
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:29,001
That can't be.

785
00:58:29,726 --> 00:58:31,942
How can this lie be even plausible?

786
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:36,568
From the beginning, did you plan to pretend
to be Ahn Jae Sung and snatch Soul away?

787
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:39,077
You're smarter than I thought.

788
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:43,575
But everything that Hyung did was a fraud.

789
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:45,237
I'll find out.

790
00:58:45,357 --> 00:58:46,495
A fraud?

791
00:58:46,964 --> 00:58:49,405
Getting back what's mine is a fraud?

792
00:58:49,665 --> 00:58:51,558
If you are so confident, do it.

793
00:58:52,368 --> 00:58:53,860
You tell the banks,

794
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,268
no matter what, you have to
stop Soul from bankruptcy.

795
00:58:56,388 --> 00:58:57,807
I beg you.

796
00:58:59,736 --> 00:59:03,018
Shin Hyun Woo's asking you to do this?

797
00:59:03,138 --> 00:59:05,139
Even though you say it's for our parents,

798
00:59:05,259 --> 00:59:07,375
there's no reason to hate Hyun Woo.

799
00:59:07,495 --> 00:59:10,018
What has that person done to you?

800
00:59:10,138 --> 00:59:16,093
He loved you so innocently,
and was thrown into death by you.

801
00:59:16,476 --> 00:59:19,940
But, why do you still torture him this way.

802
00:59:20,729 --> 00:59:23,414
I want to take revenge for Joo Seung.

803
00:59:24,224 --> 00:59:28,846
The life that Joo Seung had, having the same son,
yet being abandoned by his parents,

804
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,425
I have to comfort him too.

805
00:59:32,853 --> 00:59:34,558
Do you know?

806
00:59:34,678 --> 00:59:37,957
I've called the police to this coffee shop.

807
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,068
I told the police that I'm with the criminal
that set fire to Yang Pyeong.

808
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:45,775
Now, the police are rushing over.

809
00:59:45,895 --> 00:59:47,422
Are you crazy?

810
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,043
Are you going to hand your
sister over to the police in the end?

811
00:59:50,163 --> 00:59:53,558
I gave you every opportunity
to repent, but you refused.

812
00:59:53,678 --> 00:59:55,050
What are you going to do?

813
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:59,846
Are you going to block the invoice, or are you
going to be investigated by the police?

814
01:00:03,991 --> 01:00:05,568
Get up, follow me.

815
01:00:05,688 --> 01:00:08,552
Let go of me, let go of me!

816
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,956
Now it's time you let go of Yoon Jae Hee,

817
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:45,833
and return to being Joo Kyeong Ran.

818
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:50,847
Then, I'll forget everything
that you did to me as Yoon Jae Hee.

819
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:53,149
No, I don't want to.

820
01:00:53,447 --> 01:00:55,962
Do you not understand why
I returned you the red shoes?

821
01:00:56,082 --> 01:00:59,461
That's because I don't
want to live as Joo Kyeong Ran.

822
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,806
<i>Don't cling on to me.</i>

823
01:01:01,926 --> 01:01:05,280
Joo Ah Ran's sister,
Joo Kyeong Ran, died 25 years ago.

824
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,653
Now, we're not sisters anymore

825
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:13,044
Even if we hear of anyone's death,
let's not look for each other.

826
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,198
How could you...

827
01:01:21,714 --> 01:01:23,440
Let's die together.

828
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,488
Living like that, we might as well die.

829
01:01:26,777 --> 01:01:28,087
Let go of me!

830
01:01:28,207 --> 01:01:31,476
Why should I die with you?
If you want to die, go die by yourself.

831
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:34,588
I promised Mom I'd take care of you.

832
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:36,399
So if we die, we die together.

833
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:38,071
No! I'm not dying!

834
01:01:38,191 --> 01:01:39,521
Let go of me!

835
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:43,421
Look clearly!

836
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:48,707
Here, is the river where
Mom and Dad's ashes were scattered.

837
01:01:53,454 --> 01:01:55,820
You don't remember,

838
01:01:57,057 --> 01:01:59,998
but we sent Mom and Dad away here.

839
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:07,987
The day that accident
happened was my birthday.

840
01:02:09,754 --> 01:02:16,191
The day I was born,
became my nightmare.

841
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,696
When we were young,

842
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,872
watching your parents die,
do you know what that means?

843
01:02:30,324 --> 01:02:31,639
Not even paying your last respects

844
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,718
and the feeling of losing your parents,
do you know what that feels like?!

845
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:42,816
Everyone in the world said I was cheap,
a burden, and pointed fingers at me.

846
01:02:44,478 --> 01:02:46,801
<i>I thought you could at least understand me.</i>

847
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:54,048
I thought you could comfort me for
all the pain that I suffered all this time.

848
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:58,140
That's why I hung on till now.

849
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:06,752
Pouring drinks for other people,
and jumping on tables to dance,

850
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:10,440
it wasn't tiring once I thought of you.

851
01:03:14,022 --> 01:03:18,867
I thought everything would be worth it,
as long as you understood me and comforted me.

852
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:26,925
I really didn't imagine, that we would be
doing this in front of Mom and Dad's ashes!

853
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:46,563
Now, do as you wish.

854
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:50,584
Turn me over to the police,

855
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:54,697
kill me for Shin Hyun Woo,

856
01:03:55,662 --> 01:03:57,559
do as you wish.

857
01:04:00,117 --> 01:04:02,078
<i>Being able to see you,</i>

858
01:04:03,442 --> 01:04:05,190
was enough.

859
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:11,250
I thought you died of
hunger a long time ago.

860
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,875
Knowing that you're still on this earth,

861
01:04:17,539 --> 01:04:19,863
is enough.

862
01:04:37,895 --> 01:04:39,067
Unnie.

863
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,373
The people I miss,

864
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:47,934
aren't Mom or Dad.

865
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:54,952
It's the Unnie, that put
on the red shoes for me.

866
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:59,962
<i>Unnie's warm hands,</i>

867
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,630
<i>I've been missing that for 25 years.</i>

868
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:08,381
But how can I forgive Unnie?

869
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:11,150
If I help Unnie,

870
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:15,434
Unnie will become a coward
that runs away for her entire life.

871
01:05:17,714 --> 01:05:23,011
It's not too late now,
hurry and turn yourself in.

872
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:28,574
Then, the rest of my life,
I'll live for you Unnie.

873
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,034
I promise.

874
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,210
I don't care even if I
turn into an accomplice.

875
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:37,442
I'll stay by Unnie's side,

876
01:05:38,895 --> 01:05:41,116
and repent for you till the day I die.

877
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:49,736
I'm heading to the hospital right now.

878
01:05:49,856 --> 01:05:53,194
Shin Hyun Woo bribed
Ahn Jae Sung to hit me hard,

879
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:56,178
and I can't let things be as well.

880
01:05:59,141 --> 01:06:00,483
<i>That's right.</i>

881
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:04,112
<i>In the end, everything will come to light.</i>

882
01:06:04,232 --> 01:06:07,053
<i>Rather than running away like a coward,</i>

883
01:06:07,607 --> 01:06:10,890
<i>I should just turn myself
in with my head held high.</i>

884
01:06:12,451 --> 01:06:17,950
<i>Shin Woo Sub has lost so much,
it's time I let him go.</i>

885
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:30,486
I'm afraid you didn't see today's papers,

886
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:31,936
I brought them for you.

887
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:33,726
What are you doing,
you can't.

888
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,341
Soul Furniture, announcing
bankruptcy for the first time.

889
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:41,455
What is going on, didn't you
say the invoices were settled?

890
01:06:41,575 --> 01:06:44,648
I did it.

891
01:06:47,035 --> 01:06:52,300
Ah Ran bought the last invoice,
it was in my hands, and I turned it in.

892
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,392
In the end, you chose to
become enemies with us, is that it?

893
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:59,442
Will you only be comfortable if
you stab a knife into your mother's heart?

894
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:01,424
<i>You settle this.</i>

895
01:07:01,544 --> 01:07:03,769
After we eventually end up bankrupt,

896
01:07:03,889 --> 01:07:06,669
it's not possible for me
to even think about forgiving you.

897
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:10,128
The mastermind of this entire thing,
was President's family.

898
01:07:10,248 --> 01:07:13,401
You have no right,
to talk about forgiveness.

899
01:07:14,808 --> 01:07:16,982
President, you don't know, right?

900
01:07:17,102 --> 01:07:21,186
The person who killed
Ah Ran's parents, is Madam.

901
01:07:21,306 --> 01:07:23,296
What... What are you saying?

902
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:25,518
<i>Are you crazy?!</i>

903
01:07:25,638 --> 01:07:29,632
You didn't know that Madam
did something to the tires, did you?

904
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:32,280
The person that killed Ah Ran's parents,

905
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,029
<i>plunging the two sisters into tragedy,</i>

906
01:07:35,149 --> 01:07:36,649
was Madam!

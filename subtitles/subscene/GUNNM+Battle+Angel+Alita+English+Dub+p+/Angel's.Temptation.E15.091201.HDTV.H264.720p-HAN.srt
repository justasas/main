Temptation Of An Angel

00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,559
Episode 15

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,755
Ah Ran.

4
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:21,150
Marry me.

5
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:29,906
Even if you approached me
because of my money,

6
00:00:30,337 --> 00:00:32,759
it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,368
<i>Use me, need me.</i>

8
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:41,996
Everyone says love is
selfish anyways.

9
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:45,553
I've married before.

10
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:51,487
Even if I have problems
with my husband's family.

11
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,748
It doesn't matter?

12
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:59,277
You don't know anything about my past.

13
00:01:06,882 --> 00:01:10,772
For you, what I want to
know isn't your past.

14
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,543
It's how much you love me now.

15
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,658
<i>I don't care if you're whoever's
daughter-in-law, whoever's lover.</i>

16
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:22,245
If it's Joo Ah Ran,

17
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,902
I'm confident in loving
you until the end.

18
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,986
Why did you come? I'll listen to
the important things first.

19
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:47,985
{\a6}Episode 15

20
00:01:48,258 --> 00:01:51,569
Once Ah Ran arrives, I'll speak.

21
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:53,947
Ah Ran's like this, Doctor Nam's like this.

22
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,623
If we have nothing to
listen to, please leave.

23
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,882
No, you have to listen.

24
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,094
Until now, I've been following you.

25
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,138
From this moment on,

26
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:05,844
however I want it done,
it'll be done that way.

27
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,260
What is this attitude?

28
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:10,852
You want to separate from us starting now?

29
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:13,474
Is there anyone in the world that acts
friendly with people they hate?

30
00:02:13,664 --> 00:02:18,131
<i>I'm not like a pig that would blindly seek
approval from a hateful master.</i>

31
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:22,585
There's no reason to endure
Madam's type of treatment.

32
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:27,962
You scary person. Who do you
dare talk to like that?

33
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:30,040
<i>Even if it's like this,
I treated you like my own son.</i>

34
00:02:30,134 --> 00:02:32,168
If I was really your son,

35
00:02:32,603 --> 00:02:34,607
you wouldn't remember and mention every little
thing you've done for me over the years.

36
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,725
What?

37
00:02:35,836 --> 00:02:38,844
I don't want to be treated
like Hyun Woo Hyung.

38
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,225
I was never once this family's son.

39
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:45,037
Even when I ate warm rice,
it always caught in my throat.

40
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:47,911
And because of the cold stares on my back,

41
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:53,371
I was never once comfortable here.

42
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,682
<i>To President, I'm only Secretary Nam's son.</i>

43
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,242
<i>To Madam, I'm an annoying person's guest.</i>

44
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,236
Then.

45
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,500
Mom... Dad...

46
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:24,683
Help me.

47
00:03:25,276 --> 00:03:29,127
Even if it's leaving through
the back door with the king,

48
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:33,585
don't let Ahjussi leave me.

49
00:03:35,033 --> 00:03:39,148
I lived not asking for anything else.

50
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:48,104
Help me grant my wish.

51
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:57,708
I mentioned you to my parents in America.

52
00:03:57,906 --> 00:04:02,031
At first they only thought their son only
did business and didn't want to marry.

53
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,846
After I said I love a woman,
they're busy getting ready.

54
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,698
Have a wedding ceremony in Korea,

55
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:12,766
then go to America to expand my business.

56
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,708
It's so tiring.

57
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:22,334
With Jae Sung by my side,
I feel really fortunate.

58
00:04:23,082 --> 00:04:30,277
I'll arrange my things quickly,
I'll have to go.

59
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:41,555
I'm not confident in waiting that long.

60
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,768
Right, it's not much,

61
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,934
I prepared a present.
Open it when you get home.

62
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:16,808
You're still here? You're a lot
more stubborn than I thought.

63
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:21,450
Woman like you also has a true heart?

64
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:23,640
<i>Are you not afraid of the sky?</i>

65
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:27,374
Carrying too many crimes,
how will you go to hell?

66
00:05:27,592 --> 00:05:31,173
Got pushed away by Jae Sung, looks like
you're releasing your anger on me.

67
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,548
My good mood today,
I don't want you to ruin it.

68
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:43,613
Today, to me and Jae Sung,
is a special day.

69
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,459
You can only live like this?

70
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:49,725
You have so much, and you
have a man who loves you.

71
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,926
<i>Why's your heart so poor and twisted?</i>

72
00:05:53,194 --> 00:05:57,356
President Nam is also your object
that you used to abandon?

73
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,889
Love in the end is a game.

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,525
<i>After you lose the game,</i>

75
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,511
just admit that you lost,
then you wouldn't be sad.

76
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:10,150
If you feel so sorry for President Nam,
pick him up and use him.

77
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:14,041
You're a person who speaks with no value,
you don't seem like a woman.

78
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:19,943
This time I've hated you.
But today I feel bad for you.

79
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:24,403
You let your mom in pain after giving
birth to you, just to live like this?

80
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:27,829
You're a pitiful person.

81
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,148
Why did you come here?

82
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:46,743
Why is it so difficult to contact you?

83
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:48,683
Did you go to Doctor Jun's?

84
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,556
Yes, but.

85
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:53,239
Then you should know
Hyun Woo Hyung is still alive.

86
00:06:53,422 --> 00:06:56,211
Now you have no other choice.

87
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,075
Plane ticket for a week after.

88
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:03,706
Arrange everything and leave this place.

89
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:05,422
The faster the better.

90
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,526
Now you're letting me go
with you to a foreign country?

91
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:11,195
Madam's actions are abnormal.

92
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:14,938
Our actions being found
out is a time's problem.

93
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:17,948
You'll leave with me, right?

94
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,743
If you reject,

95
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:29,460
then find President with these
photos, and tell the truth.

96
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,589
Are you threatening me now?

97
00:07:40,685 --> 00:07:42,658
Choose.

98
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,560
Stay here trapped with crimes,

99
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:49,129
or leave and start a new life.?

100
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,497
I don't care which side.

101
00:07:51,692 --> 00:07:54,936
As long as I'm with you, I don't care.

102
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,625
Arranging the business isn't hard,

103
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:01,512
but we need to find Kyeong Ran.

104
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:06,057
There's almost an answer.
Give me some time.

105
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:10,069
Then, stay at my apartment from now on.

106
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:11,074
This place is too dangerous.

107
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:17,115
No, Mom knows Kyeong Ran's traces.

108
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:20,665
After my parent's incident, she
seems to have taken Kyeong Ran.

109
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,436
We have to find her no matter what.

110
00:08:23,654 --> 00:08:28,408
Okay. Take care of your
health. Get her tight.

111
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:35,453
This, what ring is this?
Never seen it.

112
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:38,565
It was pretty, so I bought it.

113
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:42,337
Hurry and go. Someone might
come out of the house.

114
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:05,377
<i>Tomorrow in the cafe in front of the community
cafeteria, if you don't bring Kyeong Ran out,</i>

115
00:09:05,497 --> 00:09:11,127
<i>then I'll bring the police officers in
your house then see what you'll do.</i>

116
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:28,390
<i>At first I wanted to make the present
better, but you found out.</i>

117
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:30,824
<i>Because I thought of Ah Ran
while making it,</i>

118
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,895
<i>be happy and receive it.</i>

119
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,075
<i>I love you. Jae Sung.</i>

120
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:29,883
Marry me.

121
00:10:30,017 --> 00:10:32,304
Plane ticket for a week after.

122
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:34,572
Arrange everything and leave this place.

123
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,248
That's right.

124
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,835
I won't let Joo Seung know. Leave this
place silently and it'll be okay.

125
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:58,522
The real love comes now,
it can't be blocked.

126
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,913
Mom, Mom, why are you in my room?

127
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:13,462
Scary person, are you still considered a human?

128
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:15,191
What is this for?

129
00:11:15,284 --> 00:11:16,990
The world's witches aren't like you.

130
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:19,232
Scary, tricky, dirty.

131
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,573
<i>One Hyun Woo isn't enough,
so you pulled out a Joo Seung.</i>

132
00:11:22,753 --> 00:11:24,957
Then you want to make Joo Seung cry?

133
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:29,707
What is your motive?
Who exactly are you?

134
00:11:34,534 --> 00:11:37,237
Who am I?

135
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,129
I'm your daughter-in-law.

136
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:44,534
Shin Hyun Woo's wife,
Joo Seung's lover.

137
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:47,645
<i>Looking at it, your destiny and
my destiny is pretty deep.</i>

138
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,017
Mom's son loved me.

139
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,816
Shut your dirty mouth.

140
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,537
I'm dirty?

141
00:12:01,771 --> 00:12:04,157
Then what is this?

142
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:10,568
<i>Lying to Dad,</i>

143
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:13,675
<i>giving birth to a son of Dad's secretary.</i>

144
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,222
What qualifications do you have to blame me?

145
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,680
Everyone in the world can throw stones at me.

146
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:25,190
Only one person, only you can't do that.

147
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,905
Right, I deserve to die,
but your crime won't fade.

148
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,557
What did you do to Hyun Woo?

149
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,161
Tell me, tell me quickly.

150
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:40,254
If you want to know, check yourself.

151
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:47,394
If not, tell Dad. Ask for help.

152
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,117
So, Joo Seung will be safe, right?

153
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:54,411
Using Joo Seung as your captive
to cover your crime. Right?

154
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:57,828
So you're using Joo Seung?

155
00:13:01,785 --> 00:13:04,796
You know why I became this
family's daughter-in-law?

156
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:08,138
<i>It's Joo Seung who sent me to this family.</i>

157
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:14,288
Because he wanted to take
revenge on you, so he used me.

158
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:19,549
Feeling innocent isn't Mom's two sons.

159
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:26,441
It's me, Joo Ah Ran, you know?

160
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:49,532
This girl, came up so late.
Why do you look so sad?

161
00:13:49,749 --> 00:13:53,794
What's wrong? Did something happen?

162
00:13:54,947 --> 00:14:00,152
Is me seeking Ahjussi a bad thing?

163
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:07,027
I have nothing, I can't help Ahjussi anymore.

164
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:11,693
I should let him go now, right?

165
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,363
You girl. What's after the other?

166
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:17,793
Mr. Shin is in a very tiring state now.

167
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,179
You're grumbling about love?

168
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:24,727
I'm scared that he won't come back.

169
00:14:24,922 --> 00:14:30,306
I trust Ahjussi, but Ahjussi's heart,
Ahjussi doesn't know himself.

170
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,642
If he still has feelings for his wife that he loves.

171
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,470
Then what should I do?

172
00:14:37,764 --> 00:14:40,144
Stepping on your own life.

173
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:43,955
How can he love a woman that
turned his whole world around?

174
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,060
Mr. Shin isn't a rash person.

175
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,643
<i>Among the children who my husband raised,</i>

176
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,456
<i>is there one named Joo Kyeong Ran?</i>

177
00:14:55,663 --> 00:15:01,472
Right, have you ever heard
the name Kyeong Ran?

178
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:06,738
Kyeong Ran? No, I don't know.

179
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:09,634
Actually, daytime.

180
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:16,452
No, what am I thinking?
Hurry and get the blankets.

181
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:23,248
Dad, Mom.

182
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,470
<i>Now I can do it.</i>

183
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:29,738
I'll come back soon.

184
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:06,382
Actually, I'm the little lantern from the
Angel Orphanage that Madam supports.

185
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,244
If you don't bring Kyeong Ran out,
I'll bring police to your house.

186
00:16:10,324 --> 00:16:14,003
Then what will you do?

187
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,818
Hyun Woo Hyung died because the gas
Madam opened and let go exploded.

188
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:20,887
<i>Like that, Madam killed two children.</i>

189
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:22,699
<i>Joo Seung sent me to this family.</i>

190
00:16:22,822 --> 00:16:27,089
Because he wanted to take
revenge on you, so he used me.

191
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:39,845
<i>No, no matter what I have
to go and resolve this.</i>

192
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,685
<i>If Hyun Woo's dad finds out,
he'll kill everyone.</i>

193
00:17:24,274 --> 00:17:28,928
What? The Angel Orphanage in Paju?

194
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:32,362
My wife went there now, right?

195
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:37,157
Okay. Good work.

196
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:47,799
Aunt, it's me. Go to the place
I told you to go. Quickly.

197
00:17:48,036 --> 00:17:51,151
That woman might want to hide
Kyeong Ran. Hurry and go.

198
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:54,234
What are you saying now?

199
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,523
Okay, I got it.
I'll go now.

200
00:17:57,772 --> 00:17:59,158
Hurry and get up.

201
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:03,318
Now my shop and house are about to be taken away!

202
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:07,735
It's so early, where are you going?

203
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:12,009
So early, coming without
caring about my manners.

204
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:18,244
The child that I raised is
named Yoon Jae Hee.

205
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:20,765
Yes, yes.

206
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:28,324
That child is the nurse that
took care of my dead son.

207
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:31,779
I'll ask for you one more time,

208
00:18:31,989 --> 00:18:35,637
you can't tell anyone that
I brought the child here.

209
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:39,803
Don't even tell Jae Hee anything.

210
00:18:40,449 --> 00:18:48,649
I have something to ask you.
Is Jae Hee's real name Kyeong Ran?

211
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:53,324
Yes. I don't know much about the child.

212
00:18:53,401 --> 00:19:01,258
Actually, your daughter-in-law
came looking for a Kyeong Ran.

213
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:04,267
My, daughter-in-law?

214
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:07,026
I said I don't know the name, and she left.

215
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,486
But now that I think about it,

216
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:13,651
there used to be someone
looking for Kyeong Ran.

217
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:20,642
<i>Daughter-in-law knows about Kyeong Ran,
then who won't know this secret?</i>

218
00:19:21,184 --> 00:19:25,516
<i>How many of my weaknesses do they know?</i>

219
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:38,650
<i>How did you come here?</i>

220
00:19:38,872 --> 00:19:40,367
I called a taxi.

221
00:19:40,622 --> 00:19:42,371
<i>We called a taxi because we were in the rush,</i>

222
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,655
but who know the fee was so expensive.

223
00:19:44,877 --> 00:19:48,586
Oh, besides us, did anyone else come here?

224
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,754
Is there? I didn't see anyone.

225
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:01,540
Looks like they just came.

226
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:04,015
Ahjussi.

227
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:08,458
I thought it was a woman.

228
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,826
Let's go wait in the office.
They will come, let go in.

229
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,588
Okay.

230
00:20:20,797 --> 00:20:23,863
<i>I saw you weren't home,
so I came here to try my luck.</i>

231
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:28,374
I was worried when I came,
you look good.

232
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,102
You're okay?

233
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,915
<i>I let you go just like that yesterday,
I didn't get any sleep at night.</i>

234
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:47,875
Please go back. I'm on the
afternoon shift so,

235
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:51,299
I need to clean and wash the
children's clothes then I can go.

236
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,024
Jae Hee.

237
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:58,294
Saying I'm okay is a lie,
even if the revenge gets bigger,

238
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:02,243
you can't just take of our ring like that.

239
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:07,968
I hate myself for not trusting you.

240
00:21:08,202 --> 00:21:11,508
So I won't say anything.

241
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:14,499
Jae...

242
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,377
The child before I think I've seen before.

243
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,107
What did you see? Hurry and come.

244
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,887
- I'm not wrong, I'm sure I've seen her.
- President, I'll go first.

245
00:21:38,985 --> 00:21:43,282
Excuse me, sorry.
Can you drive me a little?

246
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:47,584
Anywhere is okay, just where
I can call a taxi will be fine.

247
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:03,564
Hello?

248
00:22:03,672 --> 00:22:05,669
<i>I want to confirm today's meeting.</i>

249
00:22:05,878 --> 00:22:08,562
<i>You have to bring Kyeong Ran out.</i>

250
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:12,568
Okay, please don't come to my house.

251
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:16,545
If you do, you won't see your niece.

252
00:22:17,812 --> 00:22:22,662
<i>Mom, why are you so anxious?</i>

253
00:22:22,818 --> 00:22:25,060
<i>Who is Jae Hee?</i>

254
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:30,020
<i>Do you have a secret our family doesn't know?</i>

255
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,484
Okay, you can let me off here.

256
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:39,856
No, since I have to go back to Seoul, I'll drive you.

257
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,398
It's our first time meeting, I'm so sorry.

258
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,942
Um, but

259
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:55,193
Where did you buy this scarf?
I have the same scarf.

260
00:22:56,007 --> 00:23:01,657
It was a present.
But this scarf is for men.

261
00:23:01,843 --> 00:23:05,900
It was given by my son, my eldest son.

262
00:23:06,194 --> 00:23:09,980
Afraid that I was cold, worried about me.

263
00:23:10,211 --> 00:23:14,178
<i>Mom, you know?</i>

264
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:21,397
<i>Endure a little longer, I won't
let you cry because of me.</i>

265
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,959
Really? My eyes are about to fall out.

266
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,848
An ant didn't even come in.

267
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:30,793
You said you will bring Kyeong Ran,
then don't worry and wait.

268
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,432
Okay, okay.

269
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,092
We're not even training a dog,

270
00:23:35,256 --> 00:23:37,733
what are we doing so early in the morning?

271
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,412
What did Ah Ran say?

272
00:23:39,632 --> 00:23:42,696
She said when she sees that
woman, she'll come herself.

273
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:46,817
Ah Ran that girl, she has
no manners towards us.

274
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,050
To her own sister, she's as nice as can be.

275
00:23:49,237 --> 00:23:50,712
Right.

276
00:23:55,075 --> 00:23:57,887
Jae Hee's Uncle is right.

277
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:01,123
Tell Jae Hee, get a hold on Madam.

278
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:06,928
A kind person like Madam, what's the matter?

279
00:24:08,485 --> 00:24:13,248
What? Jang Heung Pension has 60% of the furniture
but we've collected none of the money?

280
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:15,232
How does this make sense?

281
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:17,111
They said they were unsure of
the originality of the designs,

282
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:19,782
so they are going to pay after
all the furniture is set up.

283
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:24,408
Stupid, how can you manage
business when you're so stupid.

284
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,683
Besides pulling money outside,
you're not good at anything else.

285
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:34,216
Right, how is Joo Chul Min's brother's wife doing?

286
00:24:34,451 --> 00:24:36,139
Even though we sent people to follow,

287
00:24:36,262 --> 00:24:38,763
but she keeps going from sauna room to sauna
room, so I'm having a hard time finding her.

288
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,533
That slippery eel... wait until I get a hold of them.

289
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,600
I'll teach them a lesson.

290
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,980
I won't let them do anything bad anymore.

291
00:24:52,639 --> 00:24:57,578
<i>Yeon Jae, it's me, Yeon Jae.</i>

292
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:16,180
President.

293
00:25:28,624 --> 00:25:34,115
After the prince saves the princess, what happens?

294
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:39,055
The princess saves the prince.

295
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:57,303
<i>Eat this spicy rice cake.</i>

296
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:03,919
<i>Wake up.</i>

297
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,703
It's so early in the morning,
why are you sleeping?

298
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:09,079
What?

299
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:15,777
So it was a dream. I should have
finished what I did, really.

300
00:26:20,343 --> 00:26:23,093
Where did you go so early in the morning?

301
00:26:23,201 --> 00:26:24,760
Jang Heung Pension.

302
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:29,880
If we go to America after we marry,
I have to arrange that.

303
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:35,370
Jae Sung is so busy, it makes me too anxious.

304
00:26:35,597 --> 00:26:37,730
<i>I saw SM furniture's President Jung,</i>

305
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:40,414
I want to finish the talk about uniting,

306
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:47,193
so if we unite, I hope Jae Sung comes to sign.

307
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,041
Me?

308
00:26:49,453 --> 00:26:52,534
If I use my name,
it will only leave fuse behind.

309
00:26:52,734 --> 00:26:57,847
If I say I owe ROBBINS debt,
then I can't use my name to find fault.

310
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:04,796
Since we're marrying, it doesn't
matter who's name we use.

311
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,804
We'll follow your safe plans to work.

312
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:13,508
I will listen to you and help you.

313
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:17,106
My parents keep urging me to marry early,

314
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:19,588
they said they want to
meet Ah Ran earlier.

315
00:27:20,008 --> 00:27:25,814
Okay, I'll quickly arrange
my family and the company.

316
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:53,626
<i>Starting from now will be the real life?</i>

317
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:56,355
<i>I have the right to be happy.</i>

318
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:59,785
<i>No one can envy my happiness.</i>

319
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:05,390
<i>I've been exhausted for so long,
it's about time to be happy.</i>

320
00:28:08,508 --> 00:28:13,173
How is it? Did you decide?

321
00:28:13,827 --> 00:28:15,817
You're a smart person.

322
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:18,992
You decided to go with Julie Jung, then Jung Sang Hwa.

323
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:23,215
I'm sure you settled things out in
a way profitable to everyone.

324
00:28:25,188 --> 00:28:29,912
Yes, I just need you to follow two conditions.

325
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:34,417
Then SM furniture will be given to Soul.

326
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:39,514
Good idea. What are the two conditions?

327
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:46,348
Kneel in front of my brother
and confess with your heart.

328
00:28:46,869 --> 00:28:49,805
No matter how you argue,

329
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:55,731
you playing and using my brother is the truth.

330
00:28:56,018 --> 00:28:58,407
Then let's do that.

331
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:02,935
Since to me, he is a talented designer.

332
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:05,307
What's the other condition?

333
00:29:05,507 --> 00:29:12,749
All the designs that Sang Mo designed,
please add his name.

334
00:29:12,988 --> 00:29:21,721
Like that, he will rest in place in heaven.

335
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:28,920
That isn't hard.
Is that all the conditions?

336
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:37,405
Then tomorrow I will come
ready with a proposal, bye.

337
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:50,962
Yes, we're waiting here.

338
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:56,134
That woman still didn't come.
She just called saying she's almost here.

339
00:29:56,303 --> 00:30:02,980
I already said Kyeong Ran's sister is
almost coming, hurry and come.

340
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,447
Earning money is hard.
Why is it so complicated?

341
00:30:07,693 --> 00:30:12,630
It's a big money. All this
hard work is worth it.

342
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:16,760
Also, honestly, we don't need
to use our own money.

343
00:30:16,998 --> 00:30:19,321
Where can you find this type of business?

344
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:25,290
You're right huh. In honor of getting
a furniture store let's have a drink.

345
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,137
Okay.

346
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:29,175
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

347
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:54,997
Okay, I got it.

348
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:59,701
President, Joo Chul Min's brother's wife
seems to be near here.

349
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:02,328
Really? Hurry and turn back.

350
00:31:37,151 --> 00:31:38,300
They still didn't come?

351
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:41,401
They said they'll be here for 10 minutes already.

352
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:46,449
What kind of woman is that unreliable.

353
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:50,250
Since she said she's coming,
then she could be here soon.

354
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:55,226
We need to know anyways.

355
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:58,001
So I'll tell you the woman who
took Kyeong Ran is my Mom.

356
00:31:58,286 --> 00:32:00,965
- What? Mom?
- What? Mom?

357
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:05,988
Then, President Shin's wife took
our Kyeong Ran, right?

358
00:32:06,143 --> 00:32:08,473
Oh my god,

359
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,878
Having your parents killed in
the same day is too much,

360
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,049
<i>And now they've taken your sister?</i>

361
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,874
This woman should be hit
and killed by lightning!

362
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:23,354
But, how can you appear here right now?

363
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:26,831
Then, whoever's daughter you are,
will be found out soon.

364
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:29,730
It doesn't matter.

365
00:32:30,171 --> 00:32:33,069
I just need to get a hold of my Mom's weak point.

366
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:37,534
Mom won't say who's daughter I am so easily.

367
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,297
I don't know what you two
are saying. I'm busy, I'm going.

368
00:32:50,447 --> 00:32:53,791
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

369
00:32:55,564 --> 00:33:00,378
Why is Hyun Woo's wife seeing these people?

370
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,468
What did my father do to your family?

371
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:05,825
There has to be something innocent. I'll...

372
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,050
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

373
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:10,080
Dad.

374
00:33:10,662 --> 00:33:13,342
You know these people? Right?

375
00:33:13,587 --> 00:33:15,369
No.

376
00:33:15,812 --> 00:33:19,372
No long ago there were threatening
phone calls, so I couldn't help but meet them.

377
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,822
At the end, I don't know what
they're talking about.

378
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:26,174
Threaten? What are you threatening?

379
00:33:26,393 --> 00:33:29,819
What? If you want to know something,
ask me personally,

380
00:33:29,935 --> 00:33:32,527
I will tell you.

381
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,957
Secretary Kang, what are you doing? Get them.

382
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:40,029
Yes, President.

383
00:33:44,676 --> 00:33:46,716
It's your business again.

384
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:52,386
Was this your plan? Did you hire
those people to get to me?

385
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:56,357
Father, did you make any
huge mistakes in your past?

386
00:33:56,521 --> 00:34:02,125
Hearing from them,
Dad killed their brother's wife.

387
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:03,349
Is that the truth?

388
00:34:03,413 --> 00:34:05,271
What? Killer?

389
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:10,785
Since Dad already knows,
then please resolve it yourself. Then.

390
00:34:19,563 --> 00:34:22,719
They said they were workers from the factory

391
00:34:22,932 --> 00:34:28,798
You can't have purposely have killed
those unfortunate people, did you?

392
00:34:48,195 --> 00:34:51,769
Mom, you look pale.
Are you sick?

393
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:54,449
I need to rest a little.

394
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:58,158
Who is it? Don't open the door to random people.

395
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:05,151
It's a delivery, I'll go get it.

396
00:35:11,407 --> 00:35:14,876
What is this? It was delivered.

397
00:35:14,996 --> 00:35:18,965
There's no address or name.

398
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:21,209
Give me.

399
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:33,395
This is Hyun Woo, our Hyun Woo.

400
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:37,799
What Hyun Woo?
Are you talking about Oppa?

401
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:40,088
Oppa.

402
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,315
What is this? What happened to his face?

403
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:45,499
Why is there a scar?

404
00:35:45,684 --> 00:35:48,199
Mom, this is weird.

405
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:52,631
Oppa was unconscious, how could
he stand with his two legs?

406
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:56,219
A dead person's picture.
How can this?

407
00:35:58,183 --> 00:36:00,175
Mom, look here.

408
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:04,707
The picture's date says December 15.

409
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,610
<i>When the mansion caught fire,
it was November 27.</i>

410
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,350
How can Oppa take a picture on that date?

411
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:15,573
<i>There was a time at Yang Pyung Villa when
patient Shin Hyun Woo was conscious for a time</i>

412
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,135
Hyun Woo is alive.
He is definitely alive.

413
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:23,005
This hospital clothes. Even if you
have the flip the hospital over,

414
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:25,160
you have to find Hyun Woo. Hurry.

415
00:36:25,296 --> 00:36:29,549
Okay, I'll call Dad and Hyun Min Oppa.

416
00:36:29,819 --> 00:36:32,879
Should I have to call sister-in-law too?

417
00:36:33,084 --> 00:36:36,715
No, don't tell Ah Ran anything.

418
00:36:36,932 --> 00:36:39,707
We have to find Hyun Woo, it's us.

419
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:45,014
Hyung is still alive?
How can this happen?

420
00:36:45,394 --> 00:36:49,196
Is this real? You're not joking with me?

421
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:52,658
Okay, then I'll come.

422
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,325
President, what are you talking about?

423
00:36:58,971 --> 00:37:01,436
Yeon Jae, my brother's still alive.

424
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,539
After the fire, a picture from the hospital
was delivered to my house.

425
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,589
- Then Hyung is alive.
- Oh my god.

426
00:37:07,991 --> 00:37:10,054
Wait, I have to go home.

427
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,075
Wait, wait. You can't drive in this excited state.

428
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,357
Alex, Alex, no, Relax. Relax.

429
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:21,132
Don't get excited. Calm down.

430
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:25,926
Don't worry. Leaving Yeon Jae herself, I won't leave.

431
00:37:26,134 --> 00:37:28,122
I'll call you later.

432
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,234
Leaving me alone, won't leave.

433
00:37:33,757 --> 00:37:37,500
Does our President really like me?

434
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:42,714
<i>Children's Mom. Hyun Ji, where are
you? Is children’s mom, right?</i>

435
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:46,365
Our Hyun Woo is still alive?
What's going on?

436
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:52,316
Dad, look at this, Hyung is
really alive. Hyung isn't dead.

437
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,229
I said so.

438
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,735
How can Hyun Woo die?

439
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,609
What kind of son is that brat?

440
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,862
How can he disappoint his dad?

441
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:05,104
He made a mess in this family.

442
00:38:05,303 --> 00:38:07,671
He can't just leave with no responsibility.

443
00:38:07,766 --> 00:38:10,200
Husband, we have to hurry
and find Hyun Woo first.

444
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,536
The burns looks really serious.

445
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:13,769
We have to first find hospitals specialized in burns.

446
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:16,169
What are you doing? Separate.

447
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,722
From Seoul to Jeju Island,
go through all the hospitals.

448
00:38:19,946 --> 00:38:24,021
Secretary Kang, hurry and hire
some people. Find outside, hurry.

449
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,676
Yes, President.

450
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,783
I'll go with you.

451
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:34,921
But, Oppa is alive, how can there be no calls?

452
00:38:35,102 --> 00:38:38,598
It can't be that he lost his memory, right?

453
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,635
Brat that lost this memory,

454
00:38:40,779 --> 00:38:43,846
how can he remember the
address and send a picture?

455
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:48,869
Just wait, maybe he'll appear in front of us.

456
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,634
Husband, I have to go out.
Just a little while.

457
00:38:57,477 --> 00:39:01,702
Nurse Yoon, please tell me.

458
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:06,652
Where's Hyun Woo. Nurse Yoon
knows where Hyun Woo is, right?

459
00:39:06,825 --> 00:39:09,213
What are you talking about?

460
00:39:09,324 --> 00:39:11,583
Which hospital is Hyun Woo in?

461
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:13,372
Nothing can happen to Hyun Woo.

462
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:15,436
I have to find him and bring him home.

463
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:18,890
What hospital? Isn't Shin Hyun Woo already dead?

464
00:39:19,012 --> 00:39:20,909
A picture came from Hyun Woo.

465
00:39:21,112 --> 00:39:23,600
Even though the face has some bunts,
the eyes, nose are perfectly normal.

466
00:39:23,768 --> 00:39:25,862
And also, both legs are standing on the ground.

467
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,588
Nurse Yoon, go in and work.

468
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,877
Yes, President.

469
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:49,437
A picture came from Hyun Woo Hyung, is it true?

470
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:55,517
Tell me, did Ah Ran hide Hyun Woo somewhere?

471
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,915
After making my healthy son into a vegetable.

472
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,778
<i>Now turned to a dead person,
and took him away from us?</i>

473
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:03,680
I will find him.

474
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:07,600
Because I am his mom,
I'll find him no matter what.

475
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:10,339
Because you're his mom,
so you're finding him, right?

476
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,074
Then who is my mom?

477
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,022
Your son is living good and roaming around.

478
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,165
Why are you acting like you don't know?

479
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:19,922
Why aren't you finding?

480
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:23,898
If it weren't for me protecting you, you
wouldn't be a person on this world anymore.

481
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:27,152
Me abandoning you is how I saved you.

482
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:32,085
Parents who abandon their children
always repeat like a crow.

483
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:35,990
Did you listen to a talk in college?

484
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:37,727
Abandoning children,

485
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:43,122
is for the best choice for the child, is it like that?

486
00:40:43,697 --> 00:40:46,469
Don't treat Hyun Woo as
a opponent and be jealous,

487
00:40:46,518 --> 00:40:49,496
<i>you don't have that qualification.</i>

488
00:40:49,846 --> 00:40:55,214
Because of you and Ah Ran,
innocent children are suffering.

489
00:40:55,665 --> 00:40:58,653
But Hyung has a lot.

490
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:05,714
A proper family, proper manners.

491
00:41:07,262 --> 00:41:10,101
And also a mom.

492
00:41:37,081 --> 00:41:40,192
Why did you like me?

493
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:44,990
You knew that I was a married woman,

494
00:41:45,165 --> 00:41:49,028
why were you so stupid and chose me?

495
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:03,987
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

496
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:09,954
I'll let your heart hurt, I'm sorry.

497
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:23,351
This is the trace that you once lived in this world.

498
00:42:23,598 --> 00:42:26,070
Even though you left,

499
00:42:26,215 --> 00:42:33,035
the furniture that your designed
will remain forever. I guarantee.

500
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:44,944
Here. It's the document stating
that SM will be given to Soul.

501
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:52,816
Even though my brother was
unfortunate, you are really lucky.

502
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:58,778
Company and men are following your wishes.

503
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:04,059
Because of the pain I've experienced,
I'll apologize to you with my heart.

504
00:43:04,202 --> 00:43:08,921
To not disgrace Sang Ho's designs,
I'll take good care of Soul Furniture

505
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,196
You're not picking up?

506
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,325
It's a phone call that will give
a headache, I won't worry about it.

507
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:31,946
After we marry, we have to live
in America for a bit. Don't worry.

508
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:34,866
After daughter-in-law comes,
my parents won't care about anything.

509
00:43:35,066 --> 00:43:36,785
They say they want to go on a vacation.

510
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:40,805
Really? How good.

511
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:45,814
But isn't she curious about me?

512
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,100
No. She absolutely trust my insight.

513
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,971
As long as it's the person I love,
then there are no conditions.

514
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,709
Nurse Yoon, try to contact Ahn Jae Sung, it's urgent.

515
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:21,866
He won't pick up my calls.
Now we're not related.

516
00:44:22,053 --> 00:44:24,947
You really don't know where Hyun Woo Hyung is?

517
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:28,710
Like Madam said, which hospital is he in?

518
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:32,412
This... I don't know.

519
00:44:34,523 --> 00:44:38,627
I'll leave first. After you're done you can leave.

520
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:50,751
Ahjussi, why is it like this?

521
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:54,262
Now everyone knows Ahjussi is alive.

522
00:44:54,466 --> 00:44:58,753
I'm afraid something will happen.
I'm about to go crazy.

523
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,744
Please help me confirm,

524
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:18,341
is there a person named
Shin Hyun Woo who came here?

525
00:45:18,537 --> 00:45:21,490
He might have had a overall make-over.

526
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:23,724
Please help be check the patient record.

527
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:26,354
Okay, please wait.

528
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:32,471
You say Shin Hyun Woo, right? This patient...

529
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:34,303
We don't have that patient.

530
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:37,686
Our hospital is afraid of the risk,
we don't do overall make-over.

531
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:41,737
Lies. Did Shin Hyun Woo tell you say this?

532
00:45:41,966 --> 00:45:45,978
I... saw Shin Hyun Woo come out of this hospital.

533
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:49,093
Tell me, I have to know.

534
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:55,037
If you came to mess,
I will call the police. Please leave.

535
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:13,903
I'm finding someone by the name of Shin Hyun Woo,

536
00:46:14,047 --> 00:46:16,625
he's received a make-over surgery.

537
00:46:16,848 --> 00:46:19,411
Even if you have to go through
the whole world's records,

538
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:21,383
you have to help me find him.

539
00:46:21,747 --> 00:46:22,923
A patient named Shin Hyun Woo,

540
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:24,389
has he come to his hospital before?

541
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:26,510
He has a severe burn on his face,

542
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:28,728
please look thoroughly through the records.

543
00:46:35,229 --> 00:46:39,721
Jae Sung, what is all this?

544
00:46:40,045 --> 00:46:43,342
The schedule is too tight,
so I made a decision.

545
00:46:43,647 --> 00:46:46,654
Sorry for not discussing it with you first.

546
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:07,110
It's so pretty.

547
00:47:14,032 --> 00:47:18,345
Compared to me, you know how to pick jewelry more.

548
00:47:18,787 --> 00:47:22,309
I was worried that you wouldn't like it. Thanks for your praise.

549
00:47:22,567 --> 00:47:24,971
Do you need to invite a lot of people
during the wedding ceremony?

550
00:47:25,193 --> 00:47:30,421
No, my family is the orphanage.

551
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:36,470
I also have a little sister,
but she won't make it.

552
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:42,334
Then, one invitation card should be enough.

553
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:52,008
You even booked the church already?

554
00:47:52,655 --> 00:47:54,533
But, how can you be so fast?

555
00:47:54,757 --> 00:47:57,017
Since we are going to marry,
there's no need to delay it.

556
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:59,548
On my side there's only my parents and brothers coming.

557
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:02,500
There's no special arrangements.

558
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,184
This day at this time, leave some time out.

559
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:15,485
This day, is the day I become your man.

560
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:30,703
Thank you. I will be your good wife for my whole life.

561
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:36,138
<i>I'll help your occupation,
I won't hide anything from you.</i>

562
00:48:36,362 --> 00:48:37,861
Even when I turn old,

563
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:41,242
I still need to be the cool woman by your side.

564
00:48:41,445 --> 00:48:48,195
You won't hide anything, just
thinking of it makes me feel happy.

565
00:48:48,363 --> 00:48:49,832
Let's go to the next place.

566
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:03,856
It's so pretty.

567
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:06,825
Within the brides that I've seen,
you're the prettiest.

568
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,643
I like the wedding dress a lot.

569
00:49:09,806 --> 00:49:13,286
A person who has never married, how
do you know a woman's heart so well?

570
00:49:13,466 --> 00:49:18,039
I don't know much about woman's heart.
But i know some about Ah Ran's heart.

571
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:24,790
<i>Joo Ah Ran. Laugh more.
Be happy more.</i>

572
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:29,336
<i>If I need to shatter your happiness miserably,</i>

573
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:32,957
<i>I need to go up a little more.</i>

574
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:38,077
Jae Sung, hurry and try out your suit too.

575
00:49:38,286 --> 00:49:42,462
I want to see how handsome
you look, hurry and change.

576
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,779
Then okay.

577
00:50:02,897 --> 00:50:04,009
It's me.

578
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:07,936
Why weren't you picking up my calls? Where are you?

579
00:50:08,112 --> 00:50:12,123
Right now I'm discussing the uniting with Julie Jung.

580
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:14,002
What's the matter?

581
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:15,693
Hyun Woo appeared.

582
00:50:15,848 --> 00:50:18,940
The whole family is looking for Hyun Woo in the hospitals.

583
00:50:19,175 --> 00:50:20,413
What's the meaning?

584
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:22,849
He took a recent picture and mailed it home.

585
00:50:23,007 --> 00:50:24,806
Let's meet up now.

586
00:50:25,087 --> 00:50:27,428
Hyun Woo Hyung, he might come home tonight.

587
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:29,178
<i>Then we will be over.</i>

588
00:50:29,273 --> 00:50:36,678
No way, send a picture?
Shin Hyun Woo is already dead.

589
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:39,728
The gas exploded, how is it
possible to still be alive?

590
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:45,154
The details I'm not sure, but it's
confirmed that Hyun Woo is still alive.

591
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:51,168
We need to find your way out.
Are you listening to me?

592
00:50:56,973 --> 00:50:58,853
Ah Ran.

593
00:51:00,336 --> 00:51:02,376
How am I?

594
00:51:07,053 --> 00:51:10,755
What's the matter? Are you okay?

595
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:19,480
I wanted us to look at the church.

596
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:22,739
Looks like we can't today.

597
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:30,016
Sorry. Everything might have been
too sudden, so I got frightened.

598
00:51:34,927 --> 00:51:39,769
Before the wedding ceremony,
you absolutely cannot faint.

599
00:51:39,945 --> 00:51:46,132
I have to see your pretty,
happy expression in the church.

600
00:51:46,556 --> 00:51:49,176
Don't worry.

601
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,057
I'll be okay soon.

602
00:52:02,433 --> 00:52:06,292
How is it? Did you go to the hospital?
Did you find Hyun Woo?

603
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:09,730
I don't think he's in Seoul hospitals.

604
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:11,174
None.

605
00:52:11,386 --> 00:52:13,179
I've been asking around in
the regional hospitals

606
00:52:13,205 --> 00:52:15,015
There should be news soon.

607
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:19,327
No matter where, how, him being alive is the most important.

608
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:22,290
But, sister-in-law doesn't know about this?

609
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:25,775
This time we received divorce papers,
so what if she knows.

610
00:52:26,058 --> 00:52:29,809
Thinking about this, there are many weird things.

611
00:52:30,006 --> 00:52:32,609
the gas exploded and the house is gone.

612
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:35,231
Oppa who can't move is fine.

613
00:52:35,491 --> 00:52:37,076
This can't be explained.

614
00:52:37,276 --> 00:52:41,145
<i>At the scene, they found Oppa's tooth. How is that?</i>

615
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,682
Right. If Hyung didn't wake up and escape,

616
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:47,793
how is he fine in the picture?

617
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:51,609
Hyung can't have a consciousness, right?

618
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,421
It's not an impossible thing.

619
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,669
If Joo Seung Oppa and sister-in-law were lovers,

620
00:52:56,996 --> 00:52:59,656
they couldn't take care of Hyun Woo Oppa.

621
00:52:59,807 --> 00:53:04,239
<i>Even if Hyun Woo Oppa woke up,
it's possible that he didn't tell us.</i>

622
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:09,977
Then, the fire, was it purposely set?

623
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:11,684
<i>The bolt found in the mansion,</i>

624
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,954
<i>wasn't it locked from the outside?</i>

625
00:53:14,296 --> 00:53:17,393
When Hyun Woo comes back,
everything will make sense.

626
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,391
That brat, what condition is he in?

627
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:23,326
His own mom faced the trouble of
being accused of killing her own son

628
00:53:23,507 --> 00:53:25,352
and he still won't come home.

629
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:28,251
<i>If it goes on, what something
happens to his parents.</i>

630
00:53:28,478 --> 00:53:32,977
Maybe, Hyung won't come
home because of sister-in-law.

631
00:53:33,221 --> 00:53:36,730
If sister-in-law locked Hyung in there,

632
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:45,809
How is it? Did you find Shin Hyun Woo?

633
00:53:46,043 --> 00:53:47,898
He's hiding on purpose,
how can we find him?

634
00:53:48,007 --> 00:53:50,226
He's probably hiding behind laughing at us.

635
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,369
Then, we can't just let go and not care.

636
00:53:52,966 --> 00:53:54,828
No matter what, we have to find him first.

637
00:53:55,008 --> 00:53:56,661
Even if it looks like hospital, we have to search.

638
00:53:56,883 --> 00:54:01,466
Maybe it's not a hospital, it's besides us.

639
00:54:01,618 --> 00:54:04,306
You're talking about President Ahn again?

640
00:54:04,795 --> 00:54:06,557
It's not President Ahn.

641
00:54:06,734 --> 00:54:09,797
Just in case, I confirmed,
it's can't be Shin Hyun Woo.

642
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:11,855
<i>He doesn't have acrophobia.</i>

643
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,185
He doesn't have an appendectomy scar
and he doesn't have a peanut allergy.

644
00:54:14,273 --> 00:54:16,720
If he had a make-over because of revenge,

645
00:54:16,917 --> 00:54:18,385
he would throw away Shin Hyun Woo totally.

646
00:54:18,465 --> 00:54:20,767
There's no evidence that he had a make-over.

647
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:21,979
I asked the health insurance,

648
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:26,095
to check if there was Shin Hyun Woo's medical record.

649
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:29,271
Tomorrow, everything will be found out.

650
00:54:29,798 --> 00:54:34,329
Help me, Joo Seung. If Shin Hyun Woo
is alive and comes back,

651
00:54:34,576 --> 00:54:40,308
the car accident, and the Yang
Pyung Villa fire will be exposed.

652
00:54:40,794 --> 00:54:48,393
If they know that Shin Hyun Woo is alive,
the family isn't telling me anything.

653
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,737
Maybe they've contacted him a while ago.

654
00:54:54,697 --> 00:54:57,906
Shaking here worriedly can't change anything.

655
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:03,958
We can only arrange everything here,
and leave this place.

656
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:12,941
The play ended like that?

657
00:55:13,387 --> 00:55:18,763
It's missing the credits.
That will be our play's climax.

658
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:21,672
Doctor Nam keeps being suspicious.

659
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,763
what will happen if he doesn't make it to the credits?

660
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:30,123
In the end, God will help the
righteous people. Including Sang Mo.

661
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:40,642
<i>Ahjussi, I laughed a few times today.</i>

662
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:43,576
<i>Even though I'm tired, I'm still doing good.</i>

663
00:55:43,744 --> 00:55:49,139
<i>Before you sleep, think about
me and laugh once. Jae Hee.</i>

664
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:52,700
<i>[You cannot miss when you eat. You have to eat rice with brazed cow meat.</i>

665
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,319
<i>[When Ahjussi is sick, I'll be more hurt]</i>

666
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,677
<i>[Ahjussi, you have to drink milk everyday]</i>

667
00:55:57,855 --> 00:55:59,137
<i>[For a cold, drinking water is the best,</i>

668
00:55:59,264 --> 00:56:02,230
<i>[You have to drink 1L everyday]</i>

669
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:03,211
Ahjussi, no matter what your motive is,

670
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:08,600
marrying Joo Ah Ran twice, I oppose.

671
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:15,375
I have to tell the family about your existence.

672
00:57:31,203 --> 00:57:33,092
Ahjussi.

673
00:57:33,563 --> 00:57:39,245
You're not home. It's so cold, why are
you outside? Hurry and go home.

674
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:43,584
Ahjussi's family is looking for you, you know?

675
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:48,751
Yeah, I sent a picture.
It's about time I go back.

676
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:51,643
But why do you have to marry Joo Ah Ran again?

677
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:54,384
You can't. I'll block it.

678
00:57:54,607 --> 00:57:56,702
This isn't revenge, it's not anything.

679
00:57:56,939 --> 00:58:01,401
Why are you hurting yourself
and get deeper into danger?

680
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:07,687
Jae Hee, even if you block it,
I have to marry Joo Ah Ran.

681
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:12,746
How can you say that?

682
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:19,043
Without me, Ahjussi can still be happy? Is that it?

683
00:58:19,158 --> 00:58:23,753
Jae Hee, the person you love isn't Shin Hyun Woo.

684
00:58:24,078 --> 00:58:27,917
Ahn Jae Sung starting from the beginning,
was born to get revenge on Joo Ah Ran.

685
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,655
Leaving you now, is Ahn Jae Sung,
not Shin Hyun Woo,

686
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:33,541
<i>why don't you understand?</i>

687
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:53,530
Nurse Yoon, why did you come to my house?

688
00:58:53,856 --> 00:58:58,354
I wanted to know if you found patient Shin Hyun Woo.

689
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,190
Are you really curious because you don't know?

690
00:59:01,343 --> 00:59:05,028
Or are you using your innocent face
and acting like you don't know?

691
00:59:05,216 --> 00:59:06,798
Leave for today, there's nothing.

692
00:59:06,958 --> 00:59:10,860
I'll tell you tomorrow at the hospital.

693
00:59:20,202 --> 00:59:27,555
Right, the one marrying Joo Ah Ran is Ahn Jae Sung.

694
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,905
I don't need to feel hurt.

695
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:37,393
Let Ahn Jae Sung leave, then Shin Hyun Woo.

696
00:59:38,028 --> 00:59:45,204
I just need to wait for my real,
Daddy Long-legs and it'll be fine.

697
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,204
What is this place?

698
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:59,227
You two dare come in our house together?

699
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,165
And you're trying to leave so quickly.

700
01:00:03,868 --> 01:00:07,705
Today, I have to take Ah Ran
away from this family.

701
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:10,138
What? Hyung, are you crazy?

702
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,452
Hyun Woo Hyung being alive is already confirmed.

703
01:00:12,572 --> 01:00:14,407
In the divorce procedure, Ah Ran.

704
01:00:14,618 --> 01:00:16,527
has no reason to stay in this family.

705
01:00:16,834 --> 01:00:19,146
You scary person.

706
01:00:19,363 --> 01:00:24,178
Because of this wretched woman,
you want to end relations with our family?

707
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:29,906
Thank you. now my ears have been yelled at.

708
01:00:30,071 --> 01:00:32,923
I don't need to feel sorry anymore. I can leave.

709
01:00:33,183 --> 01:00:36,614
Actually when we marry, we don't need to get President's permission.

710
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:38,868
I came because of the kindness these days.

711
01:00:38,962 --> 01:00:42,237
Doctor Nam, how can you say that?

712
01:00:42,336 --> 01:00:44,398
Hurry and disappear from our eyes.

713
01:00:44,511 --> 01:00:48,322
Go and make a family, or have
10 children, we won't care.

714
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:52,295
<i>Don't ever appear in
front of us in your life.</i>

715
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,638
Go up and pack your things.

716
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,869
Hyun Ji, go prepare the rice.

717
01:01:02,045 --> 01:01:05,143
At times like this we need to eat, to cheer us up.

718
01:01:05,372 --> 01:01:07,728
If you won't want that brat to play with us,

719
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:12,280
the whole family needs to cheer up.

720
01:01:18,496 --> 01:01:21,726
How are you? See if you need to bring anything.

721
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:25,072
Passport and checkbook you have to bring.

722
01:01:29,696 --> 01:01:32,862
<i>Right, if Shin Hyun Woo comes back,</i>

723
01:01:33,051 --> 01:01:35,962
<i>the only one that can help me block is Nam Joo Seung.</i>

724
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:39,238
<i>First I need Nam Joo
Seung's help to live on,</i>

725
01:01:39,453 --> 01:01:44,365
<i>then I'll marry Jae Sung,
and quietly leave this place.</i>

726
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:50,881
<i>Nam Joo Seung, since we have
to go different roads anyways,</i>

727
01:01:58,226 --> 01:01:59,614
<i>[Statement</i>

728
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:01,990
<i>I, Shin Hyun Woo, October 13...]</i>

729
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,295
<i>You're tired.</i>

730
01:02:31,368 --> 01:02:34,693
Let me leave this place quickly.

731
01:02:35,165 --> 01:02:38,357
<i>I don't have the energy to breathe.</i>

732
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:43,329
Change any of my assets
you can into cash,

733
01:02:43,478 --> 01:02:46,778
and deposit it in my bank account.

734
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,163
Okay.

735
01:02:54,989 --> 01:02:57,753
This place is full of our memories.

736
01:02:57,997 --> 01:03:01,761
After a few days, this
place would also be gone.

737
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:07,356
Occasionally I will miss this place.

738
01:03:09,681 --> 01:03:14,974
Rest for a while. I need to meet a person.

739
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:30,453
<i>[Nam Joo Seung]</i>

740
01:03:38,655 --> 01:03:41,810
I, who grew up without a mother,

741
01:03:42,078 --> 01:03:45,872
has a person who takes
care of me like Hyung.

742
01:03:52,065 --> 01:03:57,527
Compared to my busy father,
I liked that Hyung more.

743
01:03:57,844 --> 01:04:01,345
<i>He was a deep loving and warm person.</i>

744
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:06,374
But, starting from a time,

745
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:11,203
that Hyung became the person
I hated the most in the world.

746
01:04:11,591 --> 01:04:15,595
Why? Is it because of Joo Ah Ran?

747
01:04:16,338 --> 01:04:18,125
No.

748
01:04:18,683 --> 01:04:21,901
You can say I'm a child that has
never drank his mom's milk.

749
01:04:22,185 --> 01:04:26,812
I have a sense of inferiority to child
who get their mother to themselves.

750
01:04:27,904 --> 01:04:31,879
I don't know what it is,
but I really feel inferiority.

751
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:34,812
Let me ask one thing.

752
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:39,018
Feeling betrayed from the woman you love and

753
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:42,823
feeling betrayed from the parents
who gave birth to you,

754
01:04:43,017 --> 01:04:45,908
which one is deeper.

755
01:04:46,214 --> 01:04:53,360
Yes, because I've never been
disappointed by my parents.

756
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:57,945
Right, giving birth until now,

757
01:04:58,172 --> 01:05:01,487
I've never felt hurt or betrayed once.

758
01:05:01,704 --> 01:05:04,380
So, the feeling I get from Ah Ran,

759
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:06,876
will hurt even bigger.

760
01:05:06,967 --> 01:05:07,833
What?

761
01:05:07,958 --> 01:05:09,855
Do you know?

762
01:05:10,608 --> 01:05:12,467
The cruel mother lion,

763
01:05:12,637 --> 01:05:16,924
to raise their children strong,
will bite the weak lions to death.

764
01:05:17,201 --> 01:05:19,358
The happiness that you're enjoying,

765
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:22,889
might be the value for stepping
into someone else's life.

766
01:05:23,107 --> 01:05:29,223
So, your happiness, isn't timely,
it's also not pretty.

767
01:05:29,408 --> 01:05:30,727
What are you talking about now?

768
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:34,426
I endure one punch, and another punch,
what's bad about that?

769
01:05:34,612 --> 01:05:39,109
Lastly, the person who hit be first
wasn't Ah Ran, it was Hyung, you.

770
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,567
<i>Hyung thinks that the punch
he suffered was the biggest.</i>

771
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,464
But, Hyung's sharp knife tip,

772
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:50,349
didn't hurt Ah Ran and I the deepest.

773
01:05:50,531 --> 01:05:54,257
It will be Hyung's most loved family.

774
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,209
You're still not drunk,

775
01:05:57,394 --> 01:05:59,354
you still think that I'm Shin Hyun Woo?

776
01:05:59,457 --> 01:06:04,377
Hyung is lacking courage
and is being childish.

777
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:08,936
Might as well come back as Shin Hyun Woo,
and get your revenge properly.

778
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:12,551
If it's like this, I will also suffer.

779
01:06:14,326 --> 01:06:18,128
At the end, tomorrow,
everything will be made clear.

780
01:06:18,453 --> 01:06:24,499
Acting as Ahn Jae Sung,
tonight will be the last time.

781
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:27,768
Enjoy it.

782
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:43,701
I was the one that first hit.

783
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:56,676
Today I'll arrange this house,
I'll also arrange the hospital.

784
01:06:56,810 --> 01:07:00,847
Although it's not a lot of money, it won't
be a problem starting over again.

785
01:07:00,996 --> 01:07:02,547
Don't worry too much.

786
01:07:02,809 --> 01:07:05,562
Okay, I also need to go to the marketplace.

787
01:07:05,682 --> 01:07:09,930
Then I'll pack the things that
I need when I leave from Soul.

788
01:07:29,617 --> 01:07:31,582
Are you Joo Ah Ran?

789
01:07:31,633 --> 01:07:35,903
I'm a policeman.
Let's go to the office.

790
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:38,353
What's happening?

791
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:40,969
The criminal that caused the
car accident on October 13th

792
01:07:41,089 --> 01:07:43,194
that happened on the highway
from Seoul to Chang-An.

793
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:46,810
The real suspect is Joo Ah Ran's statement.

794
01:07:49,734 --> 01:07:51,426
Who wrote this?

795
01:07:51,639 --> 01:07:53,723
Shin Hyun Woo.

796
01:07:54,073 --> 01:07:58,489
Shin Hyun Woo? It can't be.

797
01:07:58,693 --> 01:08:00,813
How can a dead person write a statement?

798
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:03,478
Shin Hyun Woo's fingerprint
has been confirmed,

799
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:05,124
talk when we get to the office.

805
01:08:23,495 --> 01:08:25,309
<i>If you hate us, you should have killed us,</i>

806
01:08:25,464 --> 01:08:26,820
<i>why did you touch my son?</i>

807
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:30,366
You want to take away
what is precious to you.

808
01:08:30,817 --> 01:08:31,878
<i>You're lying to me until the end.</i>

809
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:33,862
Who do you want to kill? Bring that man out.

810
01:08:34,073 --> 01:08:36,588
<i>Joo Ah Ran, to see you now, I come out.</i>

811
01:08:36,777 --> 01:08:38,573
<i>Romeo who's heart was stolen.</i>

812
01:08:38,662 --> 01:08:39,402
It's Ahn Jae Sung.

813
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:41,970
<i>Before Ahn Jae Sung helped Shin Hyun Woo
take care of everything,</i>

814
01:08:42,134 --> 01:08:43,358
<i>he went on a plane.</i>

815
01:08:43,607 --> 01:08:45,557
At the end he was caught by the bank's CCTV.

816
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,489
Even God is helping us.

817
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:47,607
If I don't come out,

818
01:08:47,701 --> 01:08:49,847
<i>then it's like giving wings to
someone who needs to escape.</i>

819
01:08:50,045 --> 01:08:51,919
<i>Shin Hyun Woo, you're
finally showing your face.</i>

Temptation Of An Angel

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Episode 14

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:09,123
Shin Hyun Woo.

4
00:00:17,563 --> 00:00:19,061
Hyun Woo hyung.

5
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:20,722
It's been a long time.

6
00:00:21,593 --> 00:00:23,554
So I see you're alive.

7
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:28,630
- What are you talking about now?
- Keep those childish acting skills!

8
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:33,287
With another face, another voice,
you think I wouldn't know?

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:35,220
<i>What plans do you have?</i>

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,426
If you're alive like this, and not going
home, what plans do you have?

11
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,823
Are you following me?

12
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:43,972
The hospital is about to be transferred, you
actually have time to waste time like this?

13
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,623
How did you survive the fire?

14
00:00:47,712 --> 00:00:50,735
In order to hide your burns,
you underwent plastic surgery?

15
00:00:50,855 --> 00:00:52,342
Joo Seung.

16
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:56,461
I'm a doctor.

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,293
No matter what Hyung changes into,

18
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,317
<i>as long as I have a drop of blood,</i>

19
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,896
a strand of hair,

20
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:06,650
I'll be able to tell who you are.

21
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,026
<i>Aren't you going to let him go?</i>

22
00:01:14,029 --> 00:01:16,307
{\a6}Episode 14

23
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,298
Why are you so clingy and pathetic?

24
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:19,539
Didn't I ask you to let it
go cleanly like a man?

25
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:21,636
Why are you so persistent and tiring?

26
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:25,231
This man here, is not Ahn Jae Sung,
but Shin Hyun Woo.

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:25,966
What?

28
00:01:26,006 --> 00:01:28,362
He had surgery to get another person's face,

29
00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:31,754
and purposely got closer
to you in order to take revenge.

30
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,477
Finding evidence to show
that you killed Hyun Woo Hyung,

31
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:37,391
and then pushing you into
desperation, how could I not know?

32
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,834
Joo Seung.

33
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,174
If you don't believe it, take a look at this.

34
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,789
<i>Can't you see the words, "Shin Hyun Woo"?</i>

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,302
If it wasn't really Hyun Woo Hyung,

36
00:01:51,422 --> 00:01:55,205
how could he use Hyun Woo Hyung's
name and do business with the bank?

37
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:58,773
With such clear evidence,
why don't you believe what I'm saying?

38
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:02,504
It's because of this?

39
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:08,223
That bank book, I gave it to Jae Sung.

40
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,272
What?

41
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:12,568
The code to Shin Hyun Woo's
bank account changed,

42
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:15,537
that's why I asked
Jae Sung to do me a favor.

43
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:21,120
How did things go, are they settled?

44
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,598
After I showed them your ID,

45
00:02:28,718 --> 00:02:31,648
they told me just like
I was Shin Hyun Woo himself.

46
00:02:32,574 --> 00:02:35,488
The money in the account
has all been taken out.

47
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,205
I was so worried,
it's such a relief.

48
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,649
Thank you so much.

49
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,753
Lies, nonsense!

50
00:02:43,781 --> 00:02:47,437
Then what about the plastic surgery,
what about the painkillers?!

51
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:49,576
Because I have a slipped disc,

52
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:52,762
I had a prescription for painkillers filled at a
hospital owned by one of my closest Hyung's.

53
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:55,513
Do I have to explain something like that?

54
00:02:56,656 --> 00:02:58,481
Other than that,

55
00:02:58,601 --> 00:03:02,021
what evidence is there concerning
Shin Hyun Woo's death?

56
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,606
Could it be,

57
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,738
that Ah Ran has something to do
with Shin Hyun Woo's death?

58
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,080
What are you saying?

59
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,714
That's ridiculous.

60
00:03:10,834 --> 00:03:14,363
<i>Don't you understand that
Doctor Nam is trying to trick us?</i>

61
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:17,268
You have to rush back to
the office, don't you.

62
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:19,774
You should head back first.

63
00:03:20,346 --> 00:03:21,599
All right.

64
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,205
I'll call you.

65
00:03:34,418 --> 00:03:36,515
What are you doing?

66
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,429
Are you going around
saying I killed Shin Hyun Woo?

67
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,554
What if Ahn Jae Sung's
suspicions are aroused?

68
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:44,777
You killed Shin Hyun Woo,
could Ahn Jae Sung not know about it?

69
00:03:44,897 --> 00:03:47,364
That's because Ahn Jae Sung
is Shin Hyun Woo.

70
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:51,993
I really don't understand
why you're so persistent.

71
00:03:52,113 --> 00:03:55,207
Mother's favorite son is dead,

72
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:59,428
and her other son was in love with his wife,
shouldn't your revenge be over by now?

73
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:00,573
We're not talking about me right now.

74
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:03,697
Are you really that angry that
Mother doesn't want to accept you?

75
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:05,522
But you have your mother,

76
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:07,642
your profession as a doctor,

77
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,313
and your siblings.

78
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,663
For someone who has 99 houses,

79
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:15,993
do you want to use me as a shield,
and get your hundredth?

80
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:18,601
It is a fact that I hate
the mother that birthed me,

81
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,802
but I don't want to ruin
you in order to fulfill my desire.

82
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,431
Now, I have no interest in revenge,

83
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:28,235
and I have no other thoughts but
protecting you from Shin Hyun Woo.

84
00:04:28,595 --> 00:04:31,394
If you ever loved me at all,

85
00:04:32,645 --> 00:04:35,338
you would give me freedom now.

86
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:38,334
The investor that helped
me was Jo Sung Mo's sister,

87
00:04:38,454 --> 00:04:41,048
and after the family found out about my past,
they leapt at me like they wanted to kill me.

88
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,422
Even President Hwang is strangling my neck.

89
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:47,668
If you force me as well,

90
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,043
there is only death for me.

91
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,121
<i>The aftereffects of the plastic surgery
on your entire body is very severe.</i>

92
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:23,325
<i>The site of the skin
grafts keep getting infected,</i>

93
00:05:23,445 --> 00:05:27,516
<i>and your heart is getting weaker,
unreasonably working out is also very dangerous.</i>

94
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:37,911
You're here.

95
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:40,901
What medicine is that?

96
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,174
Are you feeling unwell?

97
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:45,697
It's a medicine that I have
to take for the rest of my life.

98
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:47,771
Because of the traffic accident and
the aftereffects of the plastic surgery,

99
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,442
my entire body is plagued
with strange symptoms.

100
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,348
It's a pain that will accompany
me for the rest of my life,

101
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,175
I'm used to it.

102
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:58,761
I always thought

103
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:02,026
only gods could punish human beings.

104
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:04,974
But, my thoughts have changed.

105
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:07,327
I won't blame it on the gods anymore.

106
00:06:07,447 --> 00:06:10,916
<i>The price of my brother's life,
the price of your pain,</i>

107
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:13,645
I will personally reap it back.

108
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,066
The real revenge,

109
00:06:16,186 --> 00:06:19,480
is to wait for the other party to get more,

110
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,695
before you see them fall,
even more tragically.

111
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,834
<i>The child that Mom abandoned,</i>

112
00:06:34,954 --> 00:06:37,957
<i>how great could he grow up to be?</i>

113
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,883
<i>Even the mother that gave birth to
him pretends not to know him,</i>

114
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,982
<i>there's nothing to hope for either.</i>

115
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,420
<i>To understand the hate
accompanying the death of your son,</i>

116
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,308
<i>you want to kill that son you've
pretended not to know for 30 years?</i>

117
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,665
That's right.

118
00:06:57,676 --> 00:07:01,534
Ah Ran and Joo Seung must know something.

119
00:07:02,425 --> 00:07:06,241
If Hyun Woo's father knows too...

120
00:07:10,582 --> 00:07:13,338
Could you know,
a way to contact the Father?

121
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:14,844
I don't know.

122
00:07:14,964 --> 00:07:17,176
He either calls me directly,

123
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:20,354
or he contacts the people
who brought me here.

124
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,584
What?

125
00:07:21,704 --> 00:07:23,683
The people who brought me here?

126
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:26,820
Wasn't I abandoned in the orphanage?

127
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,665
<i>Director, that's what you said.</i>

128
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:36,440
Is there really a ghost?

129
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:41,704
Do you remember the factory
manager that died 25 years ago?

130
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:44,720
My hands are too slippery.

131
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,790
I've forgotten it after
living for so many years,

132
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,628
but this has been pressing
on my chest recently.

133
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,850
<i>Hyun Woo's death,</i>

134
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:59,903
<i>the instability of the company too,</i>

135
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,402
it feels like a ghost is toying with us.

136
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,713
Keep your voice down,
the children can hear you.

137
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:07,957
So what if they hear?
I haven't done anything wrong.

138
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:10,141
Someone who moves lumber,

139
00:08:10,261 --> 00:08:14,398
he brought his family during working hours,
and died because of his own mistake.

140
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:17,769
It's not that I killed him,
what do I have to feel bad about.

141
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:21,221
Please tell me,

142
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:24,459
who was the person who brought me here.

143
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,490
All right,

144
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,098
it shouldn't be a secret anymore.

145
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:34,698
Actually, the person who's always supported
you, President Shin, his mother,

146
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,775
was the person who brought you here.

147
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:37,984
What?

148
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,595
Madam?

149
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,175
She always took care of
you like you were family.

150
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:48,867
<i>Maybe she had some difficulties,</i>

151
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,030
<i>she never explained the details.</i>

152
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,260
Madam...

153
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,772
Why would she leave me here?

154
00:08:54,892 --> 00:08:56,808
How did she know me?

155
00:08:56,928 --> 00:08:58,355
About that...

156
00:08:58,475 --> 00:09:00,942
Maybe you're distant relatives.

157
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,299
At first, it was the chauffeur that came,

158
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,892
after that it was her son.

159
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,814
Just now, I heard my
Uncle called them.

160
00:09:10,934 --> 00:09:13,994
Then, Madam should know
my Uncle's contact details.

161
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,035
Mom.

162
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,300
Dad.

163
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:50,298
It's almost coming.

164
00:09:53,584 --> 00:09:56,628
God might pity me too,

165
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,932
and sent me someone who could help me.

166
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:04,345
<i>Just wait a while,</i>

167
00:10:06,662 --> 00:10:09,418
I'll personally close your eyes.

168
00:10:29,992 --> 00:10:33,357
<i>Here, a birthday present for our Ah Ran.</i>

169
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,616
Here's another pair of Kyeong Ran.

170
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,630
Wow, it's too pretty.

171
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,026
Kyeong Ran, Unni's is pretty too, right?

172
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,422
<i>Don't keep them, wear them all you like.</i>

173
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,534
If they're too small you
won't be able to wear them.

174
00:10:45,654 --> 00:10:49,032
I might lose them, so I should
write my name on them.

175
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,050
<i>What are you doing on the new shoes?</i>

176
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,597
Kyeong Ran's too.

177
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:07,348
<i>In any case, our Ah Ran is the brightest.</i>

178
00:11:07,468 --> 00:11:08,748
Here.

179
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:14,310
Kyeong Ran.

180
00:11:22,744 --> 00:11:24,122
Kyeong Ran.

181
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,892
Where are you?

182
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,151
How hungry you must be,

183
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:39,589
and how hard your life must be.

184
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:55,920
Director.

185
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,706
Nurse Yoon.

186
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,399
I would like to know something.

187
00:12:01,141 --> 00:12:04,045
What relationship do you
have with Ahn Jae Sung?

188
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:09,437
I... love President Ahn.

189
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:13,486
<i>But because of that, I'm always
being threatened by Joo Ah Ran.</i>

190
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:14,780
<i>Please help me.</i>

191
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,239
<i>Doesn't Director love Joo Ah Ran?</i>

192
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:19,405
Let me love President Ahn freely,

193
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,458
please, Director, catch hold of
Joo Ah Ran. I'm begging you.

194
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:24,218
Tell me honestly.

195
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,123
The person that Nurse Yoon loves,

196
00:12:27,243 --> 00:12:30,021
is it Ahn Jae Sung, or Shin Hyun Woo?

197
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,092
As long as you answer this,
I'll help Nurse Yoon.

198
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:37,696
What are you suspicious about?

199
00:12:37,816 --> 00:12:41,136
The last time I saw Patient
Shin was that day at the villa.

200
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:42,959
His death in that fire,
I only heard about it later.

201
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:46,012
When the fire broke out
at the Yang Pyeong villa,

202
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,302
the person that helped
Shin Woo Hyung was Nurse Yoon.

203
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:51,231
<i>Is there a reason to help Hyun Woo Hyung?</i>

204
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,987
Could you have known each other from before?

205
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,209
Wasn't the person who introduced
Patient Shin Hyun Woo to me, you, Director?

206
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,253
And the person that made me meet
President Ahn, was also, you Director.

207
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,716
<i>No!</i>

208
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:06,232
President Ahn Jae Sung and Nurse Yoon,
you knew each other from before.

209
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,511
<i>I've seen the two of you together.</i>

210
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:12,730
If the Director and Joo Ah Ran,
keeps torturing me like that,

211
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,354
I might as well tell the truth
to Patient Shin Hyun Woo's family,

212
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,495
just to shake off the two of you.

213
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,598
Are you threatening me right now?

214
00:13:19,655 --> 00:13:22,036
That's not a threat,
that's asking for a favor.

215
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,130
Then, goodbye.

216
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:47,033
Who is it?

217
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,620
Where did you go?
I waited a long time.

218
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,910
Is that so?

219
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,239
I went to the orphanage
after I got off work.

220
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:09,450
Actually, my Uncle came over,
and said he wanted to see me.

221
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,765
Is that so?

222
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:13,118
That's good, are there any contact details?

223
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,878
Not yet,

224
00:14:14,998 --> 00:14:17,422
What I want to find out,

225
00:14:18,045 --> 00:14:22,879
I'm not sure, if Madam has any
information that could help me.

226
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:25,720
Well...

227
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:29,133
She did say that a pretty
girl wanted some help,

228
00:14:29,253 --> 00:14:31,296
but didn't say anything else.

229
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,225
Today, I heard from the Director,

230
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:37,296
that Madam was the one
who brought me to the orphanage.

231
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:41,558
Was I... someone's child
that Madam knew?

232
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:44,378
I heard about it a while ago,

233
00:14:44,498 --> 00:14:48,532
but it's not like I could go ask Mom
about it, what a headache.

234
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:52,708
Or not, Jae Hee, why don't you ask Mother directly?

235
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:56,790
Take the opportunity to tell her you
were the little lantern that received help.

236
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:59,016
Can I... really do that?

237
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:03,257
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:06,726
Even with this,
I can't help you at all.

239
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,395
As a compensation,
tell me another wish,

240
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,558
I'll try and fulfill it.

241
00:15:14,024 --> 00:15:15,953
Another... wish?

242
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,619
I want to see the sea in the winter.

243
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:23,888
Do you want to come with me?

244
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,391
<i>Jae Hee.</i>

245
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:55,204
There's no one here.

246
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:59,084
Let's yell out the stories in our heart.

247
00:15:59,204 --> 00:16:00,929
Of course,

248
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:05,029
in front of the sea,
everyone wants to spill their hearts.

249
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,912
It's just like an explosion in
your heart that clears everything away.

250
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:10,483
Why? Just shout out loud.

251
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:17,713
I am...

252
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,623
Shin Hyun Woo!

253
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,864
My name is...

254
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,150
Shin Hyun Woo!

255
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:32,896
Shin Hyun Woo,

256
00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:36,203
wait a while more.

257
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:39,744
I'll immediately use your name to return.

258
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:45,941
Grit your teeth and hold on, you punk.

259
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:49,063
<i>Ahjussi.</i>

260
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,363
It's my turn.

261
00:16:54,771 --> 00:16:56,086
'Till now,

262
00:16:56,595 --> 00:16:59,838
I've never called out for Dad and Mom.

263
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,468
<i>I have to gather up some
courage and shout for them.</i>

264
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:07,331
It has to be really loud
to travel to the heavens,

265
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:09,515
you can't mock me.

266
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:14,814
Dad!

267
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:18,291
Mom!

268
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:21,260
Can they hear you like that?

269
00:17:22,262 --> 00:17:24,912
In order to get rid of all
the grievances you've faced so far,

270
00:17:25,032 --> 00:17:26,629
it has to be louder!

271
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,884
Dad!

272
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:34,019
Mom!

273
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:37,708
Unni!

274
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:41,759
Where are you?

275
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:44,558
You haven't forgotten me, right?

276
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,650
Why aren't you coming to look for me?

277
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,892
Waiting like this,

278
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:55,963
I think I'm going to go crazy.

279
00:17:58,846 --> 00:17:59,821
<i>Jae Hee,</i>

280
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:03,736
<i>I will definitely look for
your family for you.</i>

281
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,432
<i>Don't cry.</i>

282
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,287
<i>Once you cry, I feel like
my heart is going to explode.</i>

283
00:18:11,544 --> 00:18:12,794
<i>I love you,</i>

284
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:15,932
<i>I love you, Jae Hee.</i>

285
00:18:20,327 --> 00:18:22,468
<i>What happened with the
matter I asked you to look into?</i>

286
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:26,918
Factory Manager Joo Chul Ming, we've already gotten
a hold of the address for his brother and his wife.

287
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:27,872
<i>Is that so?</i>

288
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,226
<i>Call the office immediately.</i>

289
00:18:30,346 --> 00:18:35,569
What that family is planning on doing,
we have to take a thorough look.

290
00:18:35,887 --> 00:18:39,639
<i>Who is the person that is disturbing
someone who has been dead for 25 years?</i>

291
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,929
<i>Are they doing evil to our family?</i>

292
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:44,085
<i>I have to find that all out.</i>

293
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:50,318
Did you have a good sleep, Father?

294
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,714
Did something bad happen?

295
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:55,810
Don't get involved in our family matters.

296
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,902
Double check again, when the money
from Myeong Sung Electronics is coming in.

297
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:01,746
That...

298
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,302
President Hwang might need more time,

299
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,549
because of the mistake at the meeting.

300
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:08,521
That's why,

301
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:12,994
why don't we go meet SM Furniture,
in order to expedite the merger deal?

302
00:19:13,348 --> 00:19:14,627
SM Furniture?

303
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:17,612
Such a strong company is investing in us,

304
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:20,644
what reason is there to merge
with such a small company?

305
00:19:20,764 --> 00:19:23,485
SM Furniture is not a
company to be taken lightly.

306
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,379
They've just expanded their business online,

307
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:33,045
and there will be less problems in the future,
because their designs are similar to Soul's.

308
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:36,008
<i>President Hwang hopes for the merger too.</i>

309
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:38,531
President Hwang too?

310
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:42,008
He wants you to keep your
position as representative.

311
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:44,467
To Soul it's not a bad deal.

312
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,214
Although I don't have
the right as a daughter-in-law,

313
00:19:48,334 --> 00:19:51,712
but when it comes to the business,
it's better to listen to me.

314
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:02,363
You have to follow him 24 hours.

315
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:05,802
You have to report all the details,
you can't leave anything out.

316
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:08,219
I understand, please don't worry.

317
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:32,141
Where did you go, that you're back now?

318
00:20:32,261 --> 00:20:35,555
It's ddukbokki and fish sticks,
I bought them because Yeon Jae likes them.

319
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,864
Ddukbokki?

320
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:45,157
It was right to wait without eating,
Manager you have some too.

321
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,287
You must have been starving the whole day.

322
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,831
I don't want any,
Yeon Jae, you eat them all.

323
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,711
Here.

324
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,127
Is it delicious?

325
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,498
Of course it's delicious.

326
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm so hungry, I'm hallucinating.

327
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:08,077
Hold on, I'll get you some water.

328
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,052
What?

329
00:21:15,172 --> 00:21:18,621
You ate two bowls of ramen,
and you're eating this too?

330
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,611
That's true.

331
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,177
It would have been better if I had held on.

332
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:25,364
Sorry.

333
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:28,677
If you weren't hungry,
you should have said so.

334
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:30,521
Eating like that, what would
happen if you got sick?

335
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,112
So what if I got sick?

336
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,422
Manager thought about me and bought it.

337
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,026
Even if I stuff myself sick, I'll eat it.

338
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,553
Don't worry.

339
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:40,779
Delicious.

340
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:44,892
What am I?

341
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,927
Like a fool,

342
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,714
everyone can't wait to fight me.

343
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:57,431
Stop eating. You'll really got a stomachache.

344
00:21:57,794 --> 00:21:59,723
Give it to me, I'll eat it.

345
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,398
I told you to stop eating.

346
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:04,289
Give it to me, why are
you acting like that?

347
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:12,105
Ddukbokki sauce.

348
00:22:13,907 --> 00:22:16,027
I'll wipe it off for you.

349
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,165
Stop laughing.

350
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,158
Stay still, don't move.

351
00:22:34,637 --> 00:22:39,492
Because our niece is treating,
it tastes more delicious.

352
00:22:40,743 --> 00:22:42,651
If it's free, everything is delicious.

353
00:22:42,771 --> 00:22:44,093
Yes, yes.

354
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,757
Listen to what I'm saying.

355
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,788
My father in law is looking
everywhere for you.

356
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:55,519
If he sends someone to fetch you,
you definitely can't go either.

357
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:59,823
If the truth gets out that
my father is Factory Manager Joo,

358
00:23:00,173 --> 00:23:02,060
we're all done for.

359
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,279
That's something for you to worry about,
we have nothing to fear.

360
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:08,270
For our brother, we need to speak the truth,

361
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,977
and to take you out of that
family is also logical for us.

362
00:23:16,493 --> 00:23:18,995
If I die, you die with me too.

363
00:23:19,115 --> 00:23:22,960
Telling Father in law the truth,
do you think you'll get ten thousand?

364
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,412
We know, we know,
do you think we're outsiders?

365
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:32,897
What happened with Kyeong Ran?

366
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,568
How come there's no news
on finding Kyeong Ran at all?

367
00:23:36,959 --> 00:23:39,015
That...

368
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:43,637
Actually, we found
Kyeong Ran a few days ago.

369
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,803
Right?

370
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,326
Is that true?

371
00:23:47,446 --> 00:23:49,396
Where's Kyeong Ran?

372
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:52,110
Can I meet her immediately now?
Where does she stay?

373
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,230
Tell me know.

374
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,435
Yes, yes.

375
00:23:57,426 --> 00:23:59,634
We've made several appointments
with Kyeong Ran to meet her,

376
00:23:59,754 --> 00:24:07,858
but there's a lady that keeps getting
in the way, so it's all for naught.

377
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:09,662
Who's the girl?

378
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,765
Who is it?

379
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:14,602
Just the woman who took Kyeong
Ran away from the orphanage.

380
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:18,016
That woman, we don't know if she's
trying to do a deal using Kyeong Ran,

381
00:24:18,136 --> 00:24:21,533
she changed all their numbers,
then ran away.

382
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:24,183
No matter what, you have to find her.

383
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:26,882
I'll forget all the things
you've done to me,

384
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:29,405
no matter what, you have to
bring Kyeong Ran in front of me.

385
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,376
If you're clothed in skin and come to the
human world, you have to at least do something!

386
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:42,488
Today, I'm not here as a nurse,
but I'm here because I have something to ask.

387
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,099
Is that so?

388
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,371
Tell me.

389
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,797
What is it you want to ask?

390
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:50,511
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to come clean with you all this while.

391
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:56,106
Actually, I'm the little lantern from the
Angel Orphanage that Madam supports.

392
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,205
You still remember little lantern?

393
00:24:58,325 --> 00:25:01,131
What are you saying?
Little lantern?

394
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,532
Nurse Yoon is little lantern?

395
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:07,522
Yes, that child is me.

396
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:11,656
For 25 years, thank you for taking
care of me like I'm your own child.

397
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,800
Coincidentally meeting Patient
Shin Hyun Woo at the Yang Pyeong Villa,

398
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,069
really gave me a shock.

399
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:19,782
How could something like that happen?

400
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,408
Nurse Yoon took care of our Hyun Woo...

401
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,285
I came here today to look for my family.

402
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:29,362
You helped me,

403
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:33,488
do you know anything about my family?

404
00:25:33,912 --> 00:25:36,371
Ah, that.

405
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,336
I only... wanted to help someone.

406
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,198
And very coincidentally,
it happened to be Nurse Yoon.

407
00:25:44,134 --> 00:25:50,219
Then, do you know anything
about my parents or my siblings?

408
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:53,632
Of course. If I knew I would have told you.

409
00:25:55,124 --> 00:25:57,796
I'm really sorry I couldn't help you.

410
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,633
No, my gratitude for your
constant help is greater than that.

411
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:03,735
In this lifetime,

412
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:07,764
the debt that I owe Madam,
I will pay it back diligently.

413
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,056
Then, I'll leave first.

414
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,349
Nurse Yoon.

415
00:26:19,833 --> 00:26:21,614
It's a little strange.

416
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:25,762
Why have you never said...
that you were little lantern?

417
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:29,557
My special relationship with Shin Hyun Woo,

418
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:32,165
I thought I shouldn't let
your daughter-in-law find out.

419
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:35,069
What does that mean?

420
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:38,580
I don't know if I should tell you this,

421
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:43,838
but Patient Shin Hyun Woo regained consciousness
for a little while, at the Yang Pyeong Villa.

422
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:47,659
What?

423
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:51,072
Our Hyun Woo regained consciousness?

424
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,401
Then, why didn't you inform us? Why?

425
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:02,935
Could it be, that our daughter-in-law
told you not to say anything?

426
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:04,843
I'm sorry,

427
00:27:04,963 --> 00:27:08,612
I should have taken every
opportunity to inform you, I’m sorry.

428
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:13,086
Madam, the fact that you're my sponsor,
please keep it from your daughter-in-law.

429
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,358
Then.

430
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:22,176
How could Ah Ran do something like that?

431
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:24,784
Hide the fact that Hyun Woo woke up?

432
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:25,886
Why?

433
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,303
What's the reason?

434
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,923
In the beginning, they seemed
so strong they wouldn't give way,

435
00:27:36,043 --> 00:27:39,148
and then they gave way to
SM Furniture, in a show of losing,

436
00:27:39,268 --> 00:27:41,776
the next step, I'll handle it.

437
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:43,621
All right.

438
00:27:44,505 --> 00:27:47,586
I've asked Joo Ah Ran to come to the house.

439
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:50,457
Let's toast.

440
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,899
I've met the brother of the factory manager.

441
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,598
But he keeps claiming that he doesn't know Joo
Chul Ming, and denies ever meeting the President.

442
00:28:01,718 --> 00:28:03,146
What?!

443
00:28:03,718 --> 00:28:08,361
What are all these beggars
thinking, trying to slip away?

444
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:13,575
If they're really Joo Chul Ming's
siblings, they'll know me.

445
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:17,285
I'll go meet them myself, find out
where they live, and fix a time!

446
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:19,868
There were no mistakes, right?

447
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:20,928
Yes.

448
00:28:28,815 --> 00:28:30,172
This woman...

449
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,434
I heard she's Jung Sang Hwa,
the President of SM Furniture.

450
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:35,665
President Jung?

451
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:39,842
Ahn Jae Sung is meeting up
with Jung Sang Mo's sister, isn't he?

452
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,305
Then...

453
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,615
You like chrysanthemum tea, right?

454
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:15,299
Father seems to have fallen in love
with someone who likes chrysanthemum.

455
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:18,988
The house always smelt like chrysanthemums.

456
00:29:20,817 --> 00:29:23,552
When did you find out I was your mother?

457
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:25,545
Don't say it in that way!

458
00:29:26,562 --> 00:29:29,424
Your whole life you were Madam to me,

459
00:29:29,544 --> 00:29:32,283
you should live like that till you die.

460
00:29:33,131 --> 00:29:36,290
<i>The idea that you could
clumsily become my mother,</i>

461
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,092
don't even dream about it.

462
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:39,428
I reject it.

463
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:41,675
- Joo Seung.
- Don't call me like that!

464
00:29:43,566 --> 00:29:50,838
The Madam... that Dad waited for
every time he closed his eyes,

465
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,000
<i>such a pathetic person,</i>

466
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:57,456
are you going to send him away like that?

467
00:29:57,986 --> 00:30:03,257
To other people, you're
like a charitable Buddha,

468
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,713
<i>but, why are you so harsh,</i>

469
00:30:07,985 --> 00:30:10,910
on the person who's missed
you his entire life, why?!

470
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:14,118
I thought that would be the best
way to protect all of us, to save you.

471
00:30:14,238 --> 00:30:16,238
Keep those explanations!

472
00:30:16,893 --> 00:30:18,314
Just be honest,

473
00:30:19,607 --> 00:30:23,784
and say you didn't want
to destroy your family,

474
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:26,942
that I could understand.

475
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:30,992
Think whatever you like.

476
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,681
I'm already prepared to accept
your hate and your disgust.

477
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:38,253
<i>But, something has to be clarified.</i>

478
00:30:38,698 --> 00:30:44,931
Because you hate me, you and Ah Ran
did something horrible to our Hyun Woo, right?!

479
00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:01,464
The day Hyun Woo died in the fire, this is
a photograph of Ah Ran at Yang Pyeong.

480
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:08,461
The Ah Ran that left at 5, and was still at Yang
Pyeong 2 hours later, how do you explain that?

481
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:11,704
Did Ah Ran go back to the villa?

482
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:15,118
Why? Do you know?!

483
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:17,344
Is it because you hated me,
that's why you killed our Hyun Woo?

484
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,933
Both you and Ah Ran?!

485
00:31:20,053 --> 00:31:21,269
Don't try and stretch the truth.

486
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:23,262
Stretch the truth?!

487
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:31,030
I know you're angry at me.

488
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:34,104
But, Hyun Woo has no sins.

489
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,980
<i>Now, just tell me all the truth.</i>

490
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:42,457
No matter whatever you say,

491
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:45,255
I'll keep your secret till my death.

492
00:31:45,375 --> 00:31:47,354
I mean it.

493
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:48,902
Hyun Woo Hyung,

494
00:31:50,151 --> 00:31:53,585
died because Madam left
the gas on when she went out.

495
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,631
That's how Madam killed two children.

496
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,636
Me and Hyun Woo Hyung.

497
00:32:00,756 --> 00:32:02,523
Do you understand?

498
00:32:02,643 --> 00:32:07,060
If you want to push all your
sins now, to me and Ah Ran,

499
00:32:09,536 --> 00:32:11,910
I won't let you do as you wish.

500
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:23,358
The grief of our Hyun Woo,
I'll settle it for him.

501
00:32:25,224 --> 00:32:28,552
Even if my past is discovered, I'll do it too.

502
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:32,081
<i>How my son died,</i>

503
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,664
I'll definitely find out.

504
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,409
<i>So it turns out this way.</i>

505
00:32:47,063 --> 00:32:50,710
<i>I couldn't become Madam's son in the end.</i>

506
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,860
<i>Hyun Woo Hyung's death,</i>

507
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,188
<i>if you want to find out, find out.</i>

508
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:04,140
<i>But you better not provoke me.</i>

509
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,627
<i>You're here, President Joo.</i>

510
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,154
Take a seat.

511
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,876
<i>Who are you coming to see today?</i>

512
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:31,371
Julie Jung, or Jung Sang Hwa?

513
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:37,854
From the very beginning,
did you get close to me with a motive?

514
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,568
The creation of SM Furniture,

515
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:43,542
was also done with me as a target in mind?

516
00:33:43,662 --> 00:33:44,856
About that,

517
00:33:44,976 --> 00:33:49,033
it's a long time ago,
I don't really remember.

518
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,544
The person who gave me
the design, was Sang Mo!

519
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,410
<i>For his Noona to step out,</i>

520
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:57,018
and plunge his woman into misery,

521
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:59,541
do you think Sang Mo will be happy?

522
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:05,141
If Sang Mo wanted my destruction,
he should have killed me, not himself.

523
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,342
Till the end,

524
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,503
you refuse to admit your crime, is that so?

525
00:34:10,538 --> 00:34:13,238
All the men in this world,

526
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:16,079
wouldn't kill themselves because
they fell out of love, right?

527
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,547
I know the misery of losing a younger sibling,

528
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,858
but don't take it out on me.

529
00:34:25,353 --> 00:34:28,321
This is the proposal to
merge Soul with SM Furniture.

530
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,980
Read it, and let me know.

531
00:34:34,924 --> 00:34:38,698
Soul, taking over SM?

532
00:34:38,818 --> 00:34:39,991
Of course.

533
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,639
If you want to reverse it,
and have SM take over Soul,

534
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,628
I'll file for bankruptcy and
wash my hands of it.

535
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:53,064
In that case, your investment would go to waste.

536
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:59,912
If there's something you want to accomplish,
you should accept my proposal.

537
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:03,851
Then, I await your reply.

538
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:20,577
It can't be.

539
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:23,106
If Mom knew, she would have told you.

540
00:35:23,226 --> 00:35:24,081
No,

541
00:35:24,378 --> 00:35:27,558
Madam clearly knew something,

542
00:35:27,678 --> 00:35:31,359
but I don't know why she's hiding it.

543
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:35,898
<i>He's meeting with Yoon Jae Hee?</i>

544
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:38,188
I got it.

545
00:35:52,842 --> 00:35:54,474
Ahn Jae Sung.

546
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:57,994
Now, I've definitely caught you by the tail.

547
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,877
Madam,

548
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,379
what should I do?

549
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,447
Before you find out the reasons
behind Hyun Woo Hyung's death,

550
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,242
looks like I'll uncover
Ahn Jae Sung's true face.

551
00:36:18,521 --> 00:36:20,514
Take a good look at the photos.

552
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:24,181
Ahn Jae Sung knew
Jung Sang Hwa a long time ago.

553
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:27,510
SM Furniture and Ahn Jae Sung
aren't strangers.

554
00:36:28,638 --> 00:36:30,270
Nonsense,

555
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,769
this can't be.

556
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:37,166
Even now, he's hiding
his meetings with Yoon Jae Hee.

557
00:36:37,286 --> 00:36:38,968
Why?

558
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:42,911
<i>Ahn Jae Sung and Yoon Jae Hee already
knew each other from Yang Pyeong villa.</i>

559
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:49,224
Clearly he has ill intentions,
and circling around you.

560
00:36:53,902 --> 00:36:55,174
Trust me.

561
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,647
<i>If Hyun Woo Hyung comes back alive
and confronts you about your crimes,</i>

562
00:37:00,644 --> 00:37:03,527
I've already made preparations to bear them.

563
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:07,865
The person who can help you,
in this world, is only me.

564
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:15,159
But Shin Hyun Woo and Ahn Jae Sung,
are completely different,

565
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:17,009
even their looks.

566
00:37:17,129 --> 00:37:22,118
Because he was burnt at the villa,
he most probably got plastic surgery.

567
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:24,685
Personality too, interests too, tastes too,

568
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,165
they're all completely different.

569
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:29,031
To fool you,

570
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:31,051
he could have covered it up intentionally.

571
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:34,146
Also, President Ahn is a
world-class equestrian.

572
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,983
How could Shin Hyun Woo,
who hates horses so much...

573
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:39,828
Do that?

574
00:37:43,105 --> 00:37:45,310
Ahn Jae Sung is good at drumming too,

575
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,278
and good at cooking.

576
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:54,260
And he's gifted at sports,
it definitely can't be Shin Hyun Woo.

577
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,121
The fact that he's not like Shin Hyun Woo,

578
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,907
is the evidence that Ahn Jae Sung
is Shin Hyun Woo.

579
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,948
If he didn't throw out the horse-hating,

580
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:04,726
Western cuisine-hating Shin Hyun Woo,

581
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:06,761
there was no way you would believe it.

582
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:10,182
Think about it.

583
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:13,723
Is there something about Shin Woo Hyung,

584
00:38:13,843 --> 00:38:17,306
something that he couldn't
change no matter what?

585
00:38:21,163 --> 00:38:22,286
That's right.

586
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,385
Fear of heights,

587
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,036
because of his fear of heights,

588
00:38:27,156 --> 00:38:30,259
he said he hated taking planes
the most, in this world.

589
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,125
Fear of heights?

590
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,503
When I was young, I fell from a horse, so I didn't
like to ride, and also became afraid of heights.

591
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:51,311
Then, race with me.

592
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:54,407
<i>If it's not a game, it's not interesting.</i>

593
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,508
Compared to spaghetti,
bean paste soup is better.

594
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,501
You know, that I prefer Korean food.

595
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:03,727
Maybe because I grew up overseas,

596
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,399
Korean food is more foreign to me.

597
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,845
Even now, I can't get
used to the taste of bean paste,

598
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:10,499
I can't eat it.

599
00:39:48,766 --> 00:39:50,611
It's been a while, Nurse Yoon.

600
00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:53,918
You're here?
Director is inside.

601
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:57,510
What did you do last night?

602
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,059
Did you meet President Ahn.

603
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,079
No.

604
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,702
It was a friend's birthday,
so I went to play with my friends.

605
00:40:04,822 --> 00:40:06,738
Is that so?

606
00:40:18,429 --> 00:40:19,828
Did you find it?

607
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,630
Here. Nurse Yoon's background.

608
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:29,062
There's nothing special
about her background.

609
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:31,984
Do you have family certificates,
or special personal information?

610
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:36,182
She was a nurse that was here before I came,
so there were no special requirements.

611
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,253
I think I heard someone
similar to a mother was sick,

612
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:42,352
but I don't know anything else.

613
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,571
I have to get a full understanding
of how Nurse Yoon grew up,

614
00:40:45,691 --> 00:40:47,522
in order to get my information.

615
00:40:47,642 --> 00:40:49,367
What her family was like,

616
00:40:49,487 --> 00:40:51,868
Joo Seung, you help me find out.

617
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:55,065
I'll investigate President Ahn.

618
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:13,420
It seems you're really good
at making Korean food.

619
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:15,562
The taste of the bean paste
is really authentic.

620
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:18,360
It's fortunate that it's to your taste.

621
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,346
I always hear people tell me that I like Western food,
that I'm suited to live in the Western world,

622
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:26,183
actually, I'm very Korean.

623
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:34,642
Even though your brother isn't here,
how would you like to start afresh here?

624
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:36,529
If you wish,

625
00:41:36,649 --> 00:41:38,951
I could help you with anything you need.

626
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:44,146
Don't let me have useless hopes.

627
00:41:44,266 --> 00:41:47,650
During that period, I was really lonely,

628
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:51,869
so if you care for me,
I'll be moved uncontrollably.

629
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:56,977
I asked the secretary to buy
a cake, it must be here.

630
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,801
Eat more.

631
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:10,029
You're here without contacting
me at all, what's the matter?

632
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:12,925
I have something urgent to ask you.

633
00:42:17,125 --> 00:42:19,499
So I see you have a guest.

634
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,570
President Joo.

635
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,238
Ah Ran.

636
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,564
The guest is...

637
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:33,554
Jae Sung?

638
00:42:40,107 --> 00:42:44,421
Jae Sung and Julie Jung,
both of you know each other.

639
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:49,928
I didn't know the two of you had the relationship
where you went to each other's houses for dinner.

640
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:51,900
That...

641
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:58,833
President Ahn.

642
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:06,295
I thought you couldn't eat bean paste,
looks like your tastes have changed.

643
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,031
Or, maybe you lied to me,

644
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:15,650
or if not, you're someone else.

645
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:19,316
Get out, Ah Ran.

646
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,627
I'll have dinner with you another time.

647
00:43:21,747 --> 00:43:23,323
What is going on?

648
00:43:24,828 --> 00:43:26,948
How do you know President Jung of SM?

649
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:33,149
<i>The two of you, is there a secret deal between
the two of you that I don't know about?</i>

650
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:34,718
What is it?

651
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:36,224
Tell me quickly!

652
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:38,810
Don't be too excited.

653
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:42,304
I was just trying to help you.

654
00:43:42,424 --> 00:43:43,513
Liar.

655
00:43:45,697 --> 00:43:48,177
You're working with President Jung,

656
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:51,651
and planning to put Soul in danger, right?

657
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:54,471
<i>What is your real motive?</i>

658
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,757
Are you hiding something from me?

659
00:43:58,478 --> 00:44:00,836
The last time, didn't Ah Ran say,
the sister of the person who died

660
00:44:00,956 --> 00:44:04,695
because he had a one-sided love
for Ah Ran opened SM Furniture?

661
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:08,644
After I heard that, I thought Ah Ran
was in danger, and felt really bad.

662
00:44:09,407 --> 00:44:13,668
So, because of Ah Ran,
I met the President of SM.

663
00:44:13,788 --> 00:44:16,481
Are you expecting me to believe that?

664
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:21,061
If you don't believe me,
I can't do anything.

665
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:23,520
There's only one truth.

666
00:44:24,856 --> 00:44:27,511
<i>Just to get closer with President Jung,</i>

667
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,780
I even ate the bean paste
soup that I can't eat,

668
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,497
I made quite an effort.

669
00:44:32,027 --> 00:44:34,868
You suspecting me like
this, is rather chilling.

670
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,592
Joo Seung, it's me.

671
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:48,511
Continue watching what
Ahn Jae Sung is doing.

672
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:51,691
It's true that he has a special
relationship with Jung Sang Hwa.

673
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,504
Anyway, I feel like I'm
being kept in the dark.

674
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:00,205
If there's anything special, contact me.

675
00:45:11,113 --> 00:45:13,764
Why are you here?
What if my family sees you?

676
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:17,176
You seem rather anxious
because of Kyeong Ran,

677
00:45:17,296 --> 00:45:19,698
how could we lie around comfortably?

678
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:24,528
That's why, we should work
together to find Kyeong Ran, right?

679
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:26,733
If you acknowledge our efforts,

680
00:45:26,853 --> 00:45:34,639
then we'll make public the telephone number
of the woman that took Kyeong Ran away.

681
00:45:36,072 --> 00:45:37,471
I understand.

682
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,672
I'll do as you wish,
so tell me.

683
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:43,730
If it changes, I'll let you know.

684
00:45:53,978 --> 00:45:55,483
<i>You clearly promised,</i>

685
00:45:55,603 --> 00:45:58,346
<i>don't pretend this didn't
happen after you find Kyeong Ran.</i>

686
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:00,911
<i>This is the number for our house.</i>

687
00:46:01,335 --> 00:46:05,191
<i>Then, the person who took
Kyeong Ran away was Mother?</i>

688
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,498
<i>What is the reason Mother
took Kyeong Ran away?</i>

689
00:46:10,003 --> 00:46:11,148
<i>That's right.</i>

690
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,626
<i>Mother supports the Angel Orphanage.</i>

691
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:17,068
<i>Then, our Kyeong Ran
could very well be there.</i>

692
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,988
Ah Ran! Where are you going?

693
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:24,571
I'm really anxious.

694
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:29,702
We shouldn't have given
her such important information.

695
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:37,105
I came, because I have
something important to ask you.

696
00:46:37,225 --> 00:46:39,965
Among the children that my
deceased husband was supporting,

697
00:46:40,085 --> 00:46:42,446
was there a child called Joo Kyeong Ran?

698
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,545
Joo Kyeong Ran?

699
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:46,905
No, there wasn't.

700
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:48,771
There wasn't?

701
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:57,188
Then, was there a child, that my mother-in-law
or my husband took special care of?

702
00:46:57,308 --> 00:47:03,964
Madam and her son, helped the entire
orphanage, not just specific children.

703
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:07,738
But, what is it because of?

704
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,205
No, it's fine.

705
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:16,290
The fact that I came here,
please don't tell mother-in-law.

706
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:21,415
If Mother changed the telephone number,

707
00:47:21,535 --> 00:47:24,638
she must know about Kyeong Ran.

708
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:31,657
But, if I ask about Kyeong Ran,
they'll discover whose daughter I am too.

709
00:47:39,791 --> 00:47:41,423
Aunt, it's me.

710
00:47:41,763 --> 00:47:44,752
I've found out the telephone number
of the person who took Kyeong Ran away.

711
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:46,745
I'll tell you the number.

712
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:50,328
You have to find Kyeong Ran. You must.

713
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:00,907
Hello, this is Peng Chang Dong.

714
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:02,969
Peng Chang Dong.

715
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:05,174
This family is in Peng Chang Dong too.

716
00:48:05,294 --> 00:48:07,210
Give it to me, give it to me.

717
00:48:07,824 --> 00:48:09,118
Hello

718
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:12,244
Have you been living well?

719
00:48:12,364 --> 00:48:16,166
I'm Kyeong Ran's aunt, the person
who contacted you before.

720
00:48:16,286 --> 00:48:20,209
Ah, how could you change
your number like that,

721
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:22,584
did you think we wouldn't find it?

722
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:23,623
What?

723
00:48:24,789 --> 00:48:28,817
Just to cut things short,
hurry and bring us our niece.

724
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:31,197
Trying to find our your address now,

725
00:48:31,317 --> 00:48:34,335
is as easy as eating
cooled abalone porridge.

726
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:36,283
And you,

727
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:42,028
do you want to be arrested for kidnapping,
and have it printed in the newspapers?

728
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:45,173
Don't be shocked.

729
00:48:45,293 --> 00:48:50,445
Let's meet and talk about it.

730
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:53,028
All right.

731
00:48:53,148 --> 00:48:57,035
Tell me the meeting place
and time, and I'll be there.

732
00:48:57,155 --> 00:49:01,148
And, please don't call this number again,

733
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:05,281
I hope only you and I
know about this matter.

734
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:07,634
<i>Mom.</i>

735
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:11,959
Why are you back at this time?

736
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,999
I forgot to get something.

737
00:49:15,271 --> 00:49:17,179
You don't look too good.

738
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:19,341
Did something happen?

739
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,515
<i>There were two strange people at
the house, they were looking around.</i>

740
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:27,147
What?

741
00:49:27,656 --> 00:49:30,222
Shut the door tight, and
don't open it to anyone.

742
00:49:31,006 --> 00:49:33,572
<i>Patient Shin Hyun Woo
regained his consciousness,</i>

743
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:36,208
<i>for a short time at Yang Pyeong villa.</i>

744
00:49:43,287 --> 00:49:46,192
Why did Mother take Kyeong Ran away?

745
00:49:48,428 --> 00:49:51,375
To us, who had already lost our parents,

746
00:49:51,495 --> 00:49:54,174
what was she trying to do?

747
00:49:56,156 --> 00:49:57,513
Could it be,

748
00:49:59,548 --> 00:50:02,770
that when Father's crimes were discovered,

749
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:06,380
she was going to use Kyeong Ran as a shield?

750
00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:13,597
It's me, Joo Seung.

751
00:50:13,717 --> 00:50:15,823
Did you find something out?

752
00:50:17,604 --> 00:50:18,834
What?

753
00:50:20,595 --> 00:50:22,355
Ahn Jae Sung is...

754
00:50:23,606 --> 00:50:26,320
at the paper dolls convention right now?

755
00:51:40,817 --> 00:51:41,983
Hyun Woo.

756
00:51:50,806 --> 00:51:52,163
Ah Ran.

757
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:57,005
Why are you so scared?

758
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,500
It's like someone found out
something they shouldn't have.

759
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:05,867
It's just such a coincidence.

760
00:52:06,194 --> 00:52:09,014
I didn't expect to see Ah Ran here.

761
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:12,618
But, just now, did you
just call me Hyun Woo?

762
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:16,772
Looking at the way you were making
the paper dolls, reminded me of Hyun Woo.

763
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:21,606
My husband used to love
making paper dolls too.

764
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,571
<i>That's why I thought about
the past and came in to take a look.</i>

765
00:52:25,691 --> 00:52:28,163
I didn't expect to see Jae Sung here.

766
00:52:28,948 --> 00:52:30,114
Is that so.

767
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:33,146
Looks like Shin Hyun Woo
has special hobbies.

768
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:36,390
But, I didn't expect that Jae Sung
would have the same interests.

769
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,688
Why didn't you say anything?

770
00:52:39,021 --> 00:52:41,741
That you liked paper dolls?

771
00:52:53,597 --> 00:52:56,501
<i>You are really skilled.</i>

772
00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:02,739
The expressions, the color,
is really similar to my husband's.

773
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,834
<i>Especially,</i>

774
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:08,993
giving the dolls blush too.

775
00:53:09,113 --> 00:53:11,670
<i>My dolls have blush on their face.</i>

776
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,896
<i>That's Shin Hyun Woo's
trademark on his paper dolls.</i>

777
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:15,847
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

778
00:53:21,608 --> 00:53:23,431
How could that be?

779
00:53:23,551 --> 00:53:26,081
I haven't learnt the skill for very long.

780
00:53:26,201 --> 00:53:31,523
I was actually going to keep it a secret,
till I made some for Ah Ran as a present.

781
00:53:32,128 --> 00:53:33,749
Is that so?

782
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,392
In that case, today's a really strange day.

783
00:53:39,086 --> 00:53:42,202
I found the paper dolls
that you were hiding from me,

784
00:53:42,322 --> 00:53:45,510
<i>and I also saw you meeting President Jung,
that you said was for my sake.</i>

785
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:48,923
Other than this,
is there something else I don't know?

786
00:53:55,967 --> 00:53:58,655
Let's go and have fun today,

787
00:53:58,775 --> 00:54:01,899
just like I always wanted
to do with Jae Sung.

788
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:04,019
Do you have time?

789
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:21,096
<i>My deceased husband,</i>

790
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:26,736
even though he was a good and kind man,
but he was terrible at sports.

791
00:54:28,487 --> 00:54:30,681
He hated riding horses,

792
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:33,664
and was terrible at swimming and the rest.

793
00:54:35,212 --> 00:54:38,774
But Jae Sung is great at
every sport, I like that.

794
00:54:38,894 --> 00:54:42,599
How about a bungee jump?

795
00:54:43,638 --> 00:54:46,161
I don't know,
I've never done it before.

796
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:47,581
Really?

797
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,320
What a coincidence.

798
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:55,505
You couldn't be afraid of heights,
just like my ex-husband, right.

799
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,749
<i>Joo Ah Ran is suspecting me.</i>

800
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:00,956
<i>I have to be more careful.</i>

801
00:55:01,076 --> 00:55:04,030
<i>The decisive factor has been discovered.</i>

802
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:07,125
<i>If she knows I have a fear of heights,</i>

803
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:10,369
<i>she'll decide that I'm Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

804
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:14,802
Why?

805
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:17,389
Do you not have confidence?

806
00:55:19,973 --> 00:55:22,899
No, it should be quite interesting.

807
00:55:23,387 --> 00:55:26,264
I was just thinking of giving it a shot.

808
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,434
<i>The aftereffects of the plastic surgery
on your entire body is very severe.</i>

809
00:55:52,554 --> 00:55:56,717
<i>Your heart is getting weaker, unreasonably
working out is also very dangerous.</i>

810
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,399
That's right,

811
00:56:22,056 --> 00:56:28,099
even if my heart bursts here, I can never
be that embarrassing Shin Hyun Woo again.

812
00:56:29,271 --> 00:56:31,879
Because the life that already
died in Joo Ah Ran's hands,

813
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,335
can never be revived again.

814
00:56:36,204 --> 00:56:39,066
Show me the evidence that
you are not Shin Hyun Woo.

815
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:44,263
If you're really Ahn Jae Sung,
you have nothing to be afraid of.

816
00:56:46,426 --> 00:56:49,484
Your destruction is right in front of you,

817
00:56:49,604 --> 00:56:52,028
you can't give up here.

818
00:56:52,537 --> 00:56:55,442
Taking everything you own,

819
00:56:56,142 --> 00:56:59,059
and justly bringing you
to the judgment table,

820
00:56:59,179 --> 00:57:01,067
what is betrayal,

821
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:03,830
what is fear of death,

822
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:05,992
I have to show that to you.

823
00:57:06,484 --> 00:57:10,724
Even if you're Shin Hyun Woo,
there's nothing to be afraid of either.

824
00:57:11,784 --> 00:57:14,413
Cowardly hiding and watching
for your opportunities,

825
00:57:14,533 --> 00:57:17,721
you'll get eaten by the snake eventually.

826
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:22,216
Now the knife is in mine
and Joo Seung's hands,

827
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:25,121
what are you hesitating for?

828
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,114
Hurry and jump!

829
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:29,764
<i>All right.</i>

830
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:32,690
<i>I'll try it.</i>

831
00:57:33,156 --> 00:57:35,276
<i>Jump.</i>

832
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:17,300
He jumped.

833
00:58:19,972 --> 00:58:24,070
Shin Hyun Woo,
could definitely not do that.

834
00:58:27,145 --> 00:58:30,749
Even if he changed his face and his voice,

835
00:58:31,693 --> 00:58:35,022
he could not change his fear of heights too.

836
00:58:36,357 --> 00:58:37,778
Then...

837
00:58:38,541 --> 00:58:40,428
this person...

838
00:58:45,866 --> 00:58:48,537
You were really as cool as
I thought you would be.

839
00:58:48,657 --> 00:58:50,912
Did you not tremble at all?

840
00:58:51,032 --> 00:58:55,640
I wasn't trembling because I was scared,
but I was trembling because Ah Ran was watching.

841
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,097
It's a relief you thought it was cool.

842
00:58:58,217 --> 00:59:00,239
Hold on.

843
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:20,612
<i>Did you go to the paper doll convention?</i>

844
00:59:20,732 --> 00:59:24,047
<i>This can prove that Ahn Jae Sung
is not a person of this world.</i>

845
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:27,800
<i>Before Hyun Woo Hyung carries out his plan,
we have to think up an idea first.</i>

846
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:43,646
Thank you.

847
00:59:47,335 --> 00:59:48,416
I,

848
00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:53,250
even though I really like Jae Sung,

849
00:59:53,693 --> 00:59:57,955
I can't tolerate the feeling
of three people being together.

850
00:59:58,075 --> 01:00:00,499
Are you still meeting Yoon Jae Hee?

851
01:00:01,834 --> 01:00:03,785
You love me,

852
01:00:03,905 --> 01:00:06,768
and you love Yoon Jae Hee too?

853
01:00:07,383 --> 01:00:09,079
How can it be?

854
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,766
It's because she's a kind-hearted woman,
and I don't want to hurt her.

855
01:00:12,886 --> 01:00:16,604
I'll take care of it slowly, don't worry.

856
01:00:16,724 --> 01:00:18,724
That taking care of it,

857
01:00:19,362 --> 01:00:21,588
could I help you do it?

858
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:25,552
If you were sincere to me,

859
01:00:26,909 --> 01:00:29,008
<i>give me that ring.</i>

860
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:32,839
<i>even if someone maligns you,
speaks evil of you,</i>

861
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:36,609
I'll believe in Jae Sung's heart,
and walk till the end with you.

862
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:52,639
Even though I'm not wearing
it for its significance,

863
01:00:52,759 --> 01:00:55,184
if Ah Ran wants it,

864
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:58,192
there you go.

865
01:01:12,496 --> 01:01:14,221
Is there a Yoon Jae Hee here?

866
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:15,768
Yes, that's me.

867
01:01:15,826 --> 01:01:18,652
Joo Ah Ran,
sent this to you.

868
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,130
This...

869
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:32,971
this is our couple ring.

870
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:41,399
<i>This is President Ahn's heart,
stop clinging on to him.</i>

871
01:01:48,186 --> 01:01:51,642
Ahjussi, it can't be, right?

872
01:01:52,151 --> 01:01:55,331
It can't be that Ahjussi
sent the ring back.

873
01:01:56,482 --> 01:01:58,899
It can't be.

874
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:03,161
No matter how tiring it is,
he promised he wouldn't give it up.

875
01:02:05,734 --> 01:02:07,600
<i>This ring, is a magic ring.</i>

876
01:02:11,013 --> 01:02:13,642
Oh my, how did you do that?

877
01:02:13,762 --> 01:02:15,803
It attracts when it gets
close by, I designed it.

878
01:02:15,923 --> 01:02:18,050
Just like you and I.

879
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,427
What is with Doctor Nam?

880
01:03:17,547 --> 01:03:19,356
<i>You have nothing to do with our family.</i>

881
01:03:19,476 --> 01:03:21,901
<i>I have something to tell you,</i>

882
01:03:22,452 --> 01:03:24,254
<i>I'll arrive at 7.</i>

883
01:03:31,897 --> 01:03:34,822
I came because you didn't
pick up your phone.

884
01:03:35,634 --> 01:03:38,093
What is with this ring?

885
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:39,980
Ahjussi didn't take it off, right?

886
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:44,715
You lost it, or maybe Joo Ah Ran stole it, right?

887
01:03:54,378 --> 01:03:55,989
Let's just call it quits.

888
01:03:57,261 --> 01:03:58,427
What?

889
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:02,095
That ring, I took it off myself.

890
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:08,241
During this time, I wasn't
sincere to you, sorry.

891
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:11,718
Today, I'm showing you my real heart.

892
01:04:13,504 --> 01:04:17,151
My explanation is done, please go home.

893
01:04:18,105 --> 01:04:20,757
Ahjussi, ahjussi!

894
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:25,697
Ahjussi.

895
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:28,183
What's wrong?

896
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:30,706
Why are you treating me this way?

897
01:04:32,297 --> 01:04:34,862
I'm really tired too.

898
01:04:35,986 --> 01:04:38,496
Please stop it.

899
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:42,758
Please open the door and
tell me, this is a joke.

900
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:14,295
Jae Sung is colder than
I thought he would be.

901
01:05:14,415 --> 01:05:16,902
Nurse Yoon must be really hurt now.

902
01:05:19,418 --> 01:05:22,409
Now that I've verified Jae Sung's heart,

903
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:25,335
I won't have suspicions with no basis.

904
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,283
The table has been set.

905
01:05:50,129 --> 01:05:51,380
Ah Ran.

906
01:05:53,204 --> 01:05:56,765
Marry me.

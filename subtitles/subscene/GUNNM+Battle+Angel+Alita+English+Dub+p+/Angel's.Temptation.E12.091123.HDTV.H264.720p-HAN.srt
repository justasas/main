Temptation Of An Angel

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,297
Episode 12

3
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:08,144
Repeat what I heard just now,

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,917
without leaving anything out.

5
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,713
Tell me the truth.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,143
President.

7
00:00:18,254 --> 00:00:20,558
I love Ah Ran.

8
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:22,959
Now, let go of your daughter-in-law.

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:26,256
Kid, are you crazy?

10
00:00:26,845 --> 00:00:30,557
Is what you're saying human?!

11
00:00:31,124 --> 00:00:33,274
I started liking Ah Ran a long time ago.

12
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,102
Now I can't separate myself from her.

13
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:37,522
Please...

14
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:40,897
- Allow us to get married.
- Get out immediately!

15
00:00:41,017 --> 00:00:43,124
I don't want to hear a single word of this.

16
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,962
Never appear in front of us again!

17
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:50,286
Joo Seung, how could you do something like that?

18
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,382
I...

19
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:54,844
Loved you like a son!

20
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:58,400
Why can't I...

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,435
- love your daughter-in-law?
- Won't you stop?!

22
00:01:02,905 --> 00:01:06,014
Do you want to Mom and Dad to faint out of anger?!

23
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,093
Mother.

24
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,901
Don't believe what he's saying.

25
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,469
I have no feelings for Dr. Nam at all.

26
00:01:17,762 --> 00:01:19,945
I'll never leave this house.

27
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,386
I want to live my life as Shin Hyun Woo's wife.

28
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,446
Mom!

29
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,263
Mom!

30
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:48,998
Mom! Mom!

31
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:50,814
Mom!

32
00:01:57,448 --> 00:01:58,967
Hyun Woo!

33
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:01,745
{\a6}Episode 12

34
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:04,295
What should Mom do?

35
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:11,711
Tell me something.

36
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,716
I called, pretending to ask about her,
but she's not back yet.

37
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:23,899
Everybody seems worried.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,412
Mom has nowhere to go.

39
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:30,299
Maybe...

40
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,723
Could she have gone to the Yang Pyeong villa?

41
00:02:32,724 --> 00:02:35,696
Maybe she missed you so much that she went to the villa.

42
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,913
That's right.

43
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:38,979
The villa.

44
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,875
A few days ago, I saw Mom at the Yang Pyeong villa.

45
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,570
Jae Hee, I'll be back.

46
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:47,293
It's me.

47
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,237
Did Mother go to you?

48
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:51,162
She didn't come here.

49
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:53,869
Did something happen to her?

50
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:56,699
We haven't been able to contact her since she ran out.

51
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,849
Have you filed a missing persons report?

52
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,438
Brother-in-law called the police,

53
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:01,417
but there's no news.

54
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:05,673
- So you're not doing anything and just letting it be?
- This was all because of you!

55
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,121
Why did you act on your own accord and complicate things?

56
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,586
If something happens to Mom,

57
00:03:11,706 --> 00:03:13,769
we can't escape.

58
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:15,647
Don't you know that?

59
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,256
Is there someone named Jo Kyung Hee?

60
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,850
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,527
Could you help me check,

62
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:45,570
among the 119 calls,
is there someone named Jo Kyung Hee?

63
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:52,802
Mom!

64
00:03:52,922 --> 00:03:54,217
Mom!

65
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:07,103
Mom!

66
00:04:07,223 --> 00:04:08,254
Mom!

67
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,664
Hurry, wake up!

68
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,267
Mom!

69
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,555
You can't die.

70
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:17,302
You can't just leave like this.

71
00:04:17,422 --> 00:04:18,578
Mom,

72
00:04:18,698 --> 00:04:20,727
I was wrong,

73
00:04:20,847 --> 00:04:22,683
I was wrong.

74
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:23,679
So,

75
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:26,264
hurry and open your eyes.

76
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:27,539
Mom,

77
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,303
please.

78
00:04:30,107 --> 00:04:31,644
Hyun Woo.

79
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:35,015
If you find her, please contact me.

80
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:39,190
Just now, you were looking for someone called Jo Kyung Hee?

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,579
Yes.

82
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:41,504
Did you find her?

83
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:43,897
Yes, my teammate just contacted me.

84
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:47,632
She's already been sent to the emergency
room at Yang Pyeong Han Ahb Hospital.

85
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,190
- Yang Pyeong?
- Yes.

86
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:51,544
Thank you.

87
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,618
Jo Kyung Hee... Where is she?

88
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:50,536
Madam.

89
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,283
Madam!

90
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,182
I'm the guardian for this patient.

91
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:57,754
What happened to her?

92
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,605
We're still checking.

93
00:05:59,725 --> 00:06:02,732
Because she suffered a mental breakdown,
she lost consciousness temporarily.

94
00:06:02,852 --> 00:06:06,079
We put an IV drip in her. She should be awake soon.

95
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,612
Ah, this is the paramedic that sent her here.

96
00:06:11,529 --> 00:06:13,206
Where did you find her?

97
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,135
How did you get her here?

98
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,865
We got the call really late.

99
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,712
They said someone had fainted at the Yang Pyeong Villa.

100
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,144
Who was the one who filed the report?

101
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,100
It was a young man.

102
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,598
He was crying really hard in the ambulance,

103
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:28,253
and I think he kept calling her Mom.

104
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:30,960
Mom?

105
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:36,683
He was just here. Where did he go?

106
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:50,012
He called her Mom.

107
00:06:50,606 --> 00:06:52,423
It can't be...

108
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:00,810
Mom!

109
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,487
Mom!

110
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:07,259
Is that Hyun Woo?

111
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:10,036
Hyun Woo!

112
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:11,521
Hyun Woo!

113
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,709
Hyun Woo!

114
00:07:12,829 --> 00:07:14,211
Why are you here?

115
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:16,175
Aren't you cold?

116
00:07:18,113 --> 00:07:20,541
It's really Hyun Woo.

117
00:07:21,362 --> 00:07:23,720
It's my son, Hyun Woo.

118
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,588
How could you be cold?

119
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,754
I'm not cold at all.

120
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:32,287
Hyun Woo.

121
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,418
Hyun Woo. Hyun Woo.

122
00:07:35,428 --> 00:07:37,035
Hyun Woo!

123
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,712
Madam.

124
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,284
Are you awake?

125
00:07:40,404 --> 00:07:42,659
Where did our Hyun Woo go?

126
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:47,011
He was clearly here just now.
Where did our Hyun Woo go?

127
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,631
Hyun Woo?

128
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,448
That's right.

129
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:56,141
Our Hyun Woo definitely came.

130
00:08:13,495 --> 00:08:14,893
<i>Mother.</i>

131
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,709
<i>You must be strong.</i>

132
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,202
<i>So I may return honorably,</i>

133
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,635
<i>I must pretend I don't know you right now.</i>

134
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,628
Are you all right?

135
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,913
If you're tired, take a rest.

136
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,149
I'm fine.

137
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:36,193
If you had been discovered a little later,

138
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,516
it would have been dangerous.

139
00:08:38,987 --> 00:08:40,874
Everyone is worried.

140
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:44,874
I have Hyun Woo and Hyun Min.
I have two sons.

141
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,682
You don't have to worry about me.

142
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:50,725
Hyun Woo is dead.

143
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,508
Even if I'm not your son,

144
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,438
I've known you for 20 years and I've been to your house often.

145
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,407
Can't we be a little closer?

146
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:03,464
Do you have the right to say that to me?

147
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,010
Does it make sense to fall in love with the woman Hyun Woo loved?

148
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:10,783
Even though he's not in this world,

149
00:09:12,215 --> 00:09:13,770
I can't tolerate,

150
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:17,653
any humiliation my son will suffer.

151
00:09:18,002 --> 00:09:19,557
<i>That's right.</i>

152
00:09:20,273 --> 00:09:22,142
<i>Let's wait and see.</i>

153
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,690
<i>I'm curious to see</i>

154
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,206
<i>how long you can deny me.</i>

155
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:35,526
Joo Seung is bringing Mom from Yang Pyeong.

156
00:09:36,085 --> 00:09:39,491
She must have gone to Yang Pyeong Villa because she missed Oppa.

157
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,605
Now that I think about it,

158
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:45,303
since you've come in, our house has never been peaceful.

159
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:46,456
And,

160
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:50,194
you even dared to fool around with Joo Seung,
who is about the same age as your brother-in-law.

161
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:51,537
You're so casual.

162
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,630
Did our Hyun Woo die knowing this?

163
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:54,629
That's right.

164
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:57,022
Thinking about the day Oppa died,

165
00:09:57,142 --> 00:10:00,655
why did he go to Chang Won on a stormy night?

166
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,294
No matter what, it's strange.

167
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:06,054
Something must have upset him.

168
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,002
I swear I never liked Doctor Nam, Father.

169
00:10:10,122 --> 00:10:14,243
Father, it's not fair to make me responsible for his one sided love.

170
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,587
Don't call me Father.

171
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,417
I don't want you to be part of our family.

172
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,300
Pack up all of your things and leave.

173
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:31,367
Looks like Madam suffered a huge blow.

174
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:33,638
It's good that nothing happened to her.

175
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,502
Since Nam Joo Seung came to the hospital,

176
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,651
he should have contacted my family.

177
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,861
But,

178
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,499
Your mother didn't see your face?

179
00:10:42,619 --> 00:10:45,992
If you sent her to the Yang Pyeong Hospital,

180
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,734
then Joo Ah Ran and Nam Joo Seung will be suspicious.

181
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:50,922
That's true.

182
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:54,311
Because she lost consciousness,
she shouldn't have seen it.

183
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,961
But she should have felt it in her heart.

184
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:25,869
Mom!

185
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,231
Are you okay?

186
00:11:27,351 --> 00:11:30,008
Your health is not good. Why did you go to Yang Pyeong?

187
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:32,715
You should have asked me to come along.

188
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:35,510
I'm sorry

189
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,571
to have made you worry.

190
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:39,423
Who was worrying?

191
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:40,893
I don't want to see you.

192
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,495
Go in and lie down, or do whatever you want.

193
00:11:45,365 --> 00:11:46,273
Mom.

194
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:47,862
But what is this?

195
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:50,255
Why are you wearing a men's scarf?

196
00:11:51,802 --> 00:11:54,247
It seems like it belongs to the person
who sent her to the hospital.

197
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,077
She keeps saying it belongs to Hyun Woo.

198
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:58,946
What?

199
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,815
Are you insane?

200
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:03,888
Why do you keep talking about your dead son?

201
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:07,992
- Take it off immediately!
- Please, please don't do this.

202
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:10,001
This was given to me by our Hyun Woo.

203
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:13,564
I clearly heard him crying out for me.

204
00:12:14,263 --> 00:12:15,643
Any mother...

205
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:18,839
How could she not know the smell of her child?

206
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:22,098
I know, Mom.

207
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:25,697
Maybe Hyung misses you too much,
so he came to look for you.

208
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,094
Go in and lie down.

209
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:31,691
Please make a cup of hot tea for Madam.

210
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:37,629
What right do you have to be here?

211
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:40,913
What if something happened to Mother because of you?

212
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:42,956
I clearly told you.

213
00:12:43,076 --> 00:12:45,716
I never liked you, not even in my dreams.

214
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:48,580
Being misunderstood like that by my in-laws,

215
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,567
I'd rather go stand in front of Hyun Woo in death.

216
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,767
If you want to die, go out and die.

217
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:59,749
I don't want to know if you die or not.

218
00:13:00,762 --> 00:13:05,026
Why should your ugly body die in my house?

219
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:06,913
Just pretend you don't know.

220
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:08,572
Someone who's intent on dying...

221
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,633
There's no reason to stop them.

222
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,212
Evil people.

223
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,212
Where in the world would you play some evil tricks?

224
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:23,299
Were you going to eat this and die?

225
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:42,632
<i>This is given to me by our Hyun Woo!</i>

226
00:13:42,752 --> 00:13:46,038
<i>I clearly heard him crying out for me.</i>

227
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:55,343
That scarf

228
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,452
was definitely a present I gave to President Ahn.

229
00:14:00,411 --> 00:14:02,298
No, how can it be?

230
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:04,726
What am I thinking?

231
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,044
President Ahn couldn't have gone to the Yang Pyeong Villa,

232
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:10,036
let alone meet Mom.

233
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:13,972
That's right,

234
00:14:14,092 --> 00:14:16,487
Shin Hyun Woo is dead.

235
00:14:17,011 --> 00:14:20,016
They've even found his teeth.
What's there to be suspicious about?

236
00:14:36,314 --> 00:14:38,305
[Jo Kyung Hee.
Seoul, Jongro-gu, Peongchang-dong, 46P-2]

237
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:39,443
This,

238
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,521
was written by the person who brought the patient in?

239
00:14:43,641 --> 00:14:44,219
Yes.

240
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,608
Of course that person wrote it. The patient was unconscious.

241
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,403
Maybe...

242
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,559
Do you remember anything about that person?

243
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,780
Even what he was wearing?

244
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,108
That...

245
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,968
I only remember he was quite tall and quite good-looking.

246
00:15:00,678 --> 00:15:03,840
There weren't only one or two people that came.

247
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,770
Ah, that person said he didn't bring his phone,

248
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,516
and he borrowed mine.

249
00:15:09,636 --> 00:15:11,158
Is that so?

250
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,371
I'm sorry,

251
00:15:12,491 --> 00:15:14,746
but may I take a look at your handphone?

252
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,978
It seems to be this number.

253
00:15:27,044 --> 00:15:29,105
010-9329...

254
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,546
010-9329...

255
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:37,013
Isn't that Nurse Yoon's handphone?

256
00:15:43,141 --> 00:15:47,631
The people at Yang Pyeong Villa know Nurse Yoon.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,685
Then, there's only one person who's suspicious.

258
00:16:05,734 --> 00:16:07,306
Father.

259
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,944
Father, I'll do whatever you want me to do.

260
00:16:10,064 --> 00:16:12,180
I'll settle the mortgage on the house as soon as possible.

261
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,538
I'll also find a way to settle the Julie Jung problem.

262
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:16,547
Please give me some time.

263
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,708
- I'll prove my innocence to Dad.
- These are divorce papers.

264
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,611
You don't have to waste time.

265
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,091
Settle it within this week.

266
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:43,910
Niece.

267
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,741
Did you sleep well?

268
00:16:47,861 --> 00:16:50,221
You're going to work early today.

269
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,282
What are you doing here?

270
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,238
How did you find out where I stay?

271
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,426
We're people who cheat for a living.

272
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:02,126
These are the basics.

273
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:03,995
So,

274
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:06,458
I thought about it.

275
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:10,493
If we told your father-in-law who your parents were,

276
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,238
we might be able to get a big amount of money.

277
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,103
It would be good for both of us.

278
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:18,636
Let's just live with each other.

279
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,417
Exactly.

280
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:22,053
So,

281
00:17:22,473 --> 00:17:25,145
If they give us a lovely apartment that's 100 square feet

282
00:17:25,265 --> 00:17:28,411
and a storefront to do a little business,

283
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,728
I'll just pretend I don't know about you.

284
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,484
That's right.

285
00:17:36,604 --> 00:17:40,781
What's wrong with sharing the property of our enemy?

286
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,816
Get lost immediately.

287
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:48,117
Even if you wring my neck, not a bit of money would come out.

288
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:50,196
I don't even know when I'll be chased out,

289
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:53,305
and I still have to worry about you?

290
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:56,877
Ah Ran!

291
00:17:56,997 --> 00:17:57,698
Ah Ran!

292
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,406
Listen to me, it's not that.

293
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,512
What is this?

294
00:18:06,632 --> 00:18:08,241
She said she was getting chased out?

295
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:10,459
Could it be that everything's out?

296
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:11,804
What?

297
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,337
Then won't they become the dogs that chase after the chickens?

298
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:15,630
What should we do?

299
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,070
Director.

300
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,773
Tell me honestly.

301
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:37,236
Who's Ahn Jae Sung?

302
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:41,645
W-what are you saying?

303
00:18:45,505 --> 00:18:47,584
You know, right?

304
00:18:48,292 --> 00:18:50,493
Is Shin Hyun Woo alive?

305
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,166
He's using another name

306
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,629
and is around us, right?

307
00:18:56,626 --> 00:19:00,452
I don't understand what you're saying right now.

308
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:04,731
Ahn Jae Sung went to Pyeong Yang Villa yesterday,

309
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:09,024
and when he got there, he found Hyun Woo mother,
who had fainted.

310
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:13,006
He called 119 and sent her to the emergency room.

311
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:16,971
- Am I wrong?
- Does that make sense?

312
00:19:17,091 --> 00:19:20,223
How would President Ahn know Madam from Pyeong Chang Dong?

313
00:19:20,343 --> 00:19:22,040
And how would he know about Yang Pyeong Villa?

314
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,507
Then,

315
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:25,847
in the nurse's handphone...

316
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:29,081
Why was your number in there?

317
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,098
Obviously the person who sent
Madam to the emergency room

318
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:35,546
knew you.

319
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:37,458
How do you explain that?

320
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,310
At Yang Pyeong Villa, there are people who know my number.

321
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,374
I met them while I was out for a walk.

322
00:19:41,494 --> 00:19:47,783
Maybe they were too anxious, so they called me.

323
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,527
I didn't get it because my handphone was turned off last night.

324
00:19:50,528 --> 00:19:51,721
Don't lie!

325
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:56,626
You think I'll be fooled by those lies that don't make sense?

326
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:58,845
Shin Hyun Woo is alive, right?

327
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:03,226
The person who sent Madam to the hospital is Ahn Jae Sung, right?

328
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:07,572
What are you doing?!

329
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:12,539
Are you always this rough towards girls?

330
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,696
What is your real face?

331
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,037
What is the reason you're appearing in front of us?

332
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:21,964
Hurry and take off your mask!

333
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:27,449
Why are you so anxious?

334
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,528
What is my real face?

335
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:32,619
Then what is your real face?!

336
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,528
Joo Ah Ran, Yoon Jae Hee...
Which one do you care for?

337
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:41,606
You...

338
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,103
You think you can fool me?

339
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,339
I will...

340
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,363
I definitely will find out who you are.

341
00:20:49,483 --> 00:20:51,127
Go ahead.

342
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:01,735
What should we do?

343
00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,547
Director must have found something out.

344
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:08,641
Looks like he believed that the person at
the Yang Pyeong Hospital was you.

345
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:11,673
Don't worry.

346
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:15,484
Things will be over before Nam Joo Seung discovers my true face.

347
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:20,022
That aside, I would like to ask you for a favor.

348
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,755
How is your health?

349
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,794
Director wanted me to come and see how you are.

350
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:28,065
There's no need.

351
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:30,755
Anyway, take a seat.

352
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:33,814
You still don't look well.

353
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:36,364
Let me give you a nutrition jab.

354
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:37,849
Oh, right.

355
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:41,360
I saw this in the mailbox, so I brought it in.

356
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,366
This...

357
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:48,777
looks like a traffic violation.

358
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:53,668
Were you speeding on Yang Pyeong Bridge?

359
00:21:57,373 --> 00:22:01,199
Nov 27, 7:00 in the evening.

360
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,434
When was that..? To only come now...

361
00:22:03,554 --> 00:22:05,618
Nov 27?

362
00:22:05,738 --> 00:22:08,605
Wasn't that the day the villa caught fire?

363
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:12,919
That's the day I quit my job at the villa.
I remember it very clearly.

364
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,159
That's right.

365
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:16,482
That's the day our Hyun Woo met with his mishap.

366
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,281
But...

367
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:21,250
Why was Ah Ran at Yang Pyeong at 7:00?

368
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,045
She definitely left me at 5:00 in the evening.

369
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,902
Then you go to the market, Mother.

370
00:22:31,022 --> 00:22:34,220
I have to make a trip to the factory,
so I'll make a move first.

371
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:36,666
I'll leave Hyun Woo to you.

372
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,485
It can't be.

373
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,695
She clearly told me she was leaving for Seoul.

374
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,441
Madam,

375
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:50,712
are you all right?

376
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,677
I'm fine.

377
00:22:55,795 --> 00:22:57,542
I'm sorry, but can you leave?

378
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:59,799
I have to think about some things alone.

379
00:23:19,253 --> 00:23:21,331
Why are you waiting here? Why didn't you go in first?

380
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:24,196
I wanted to see if the scarf I gave you was good.

381
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:26,886
You didn't wear it?

382
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:29,453
Ah, that...

383
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:32,622
I don't really like scarves.

384
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,980
Could it be that you lost it?

385
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,465
Or that you gave it to someone else?

386
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:40,458
Are you in the habit of always checking up
on the gifts you give to people?

387
00:23:40,459 --> 00:23:42,887
The scarf is all right. Don't worry.

388
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:45,000
Go and have a cup of tea.

389
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,948
Are you hiding something from me?

390
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:51,396
Tell me honestly...

391
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,789
Who did you give that scarf to?

392
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,898
Last night, who were you with?

393
00:23:57,704 --> 00:24:01,996
I'm not so impolite that I would give someone else
a gift that I had received.

394
00:24:10,152 --> 00:24:11,601
Here.

395
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,348
Is that all right?

396
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:16,458
How?

397
00:24:17,101 --> 00:24:20,404
I thought I could communicate with you.

398
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:22,273
Maybe I was mistaken.

399
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:24,055
How disappointing.

400
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,902
Real trust is not trusting in what you see,

401
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:29,613
but trusting in what you can't see.

402
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:32,198
I'll treat it like I've never received this present.

403
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,347
Welcome!

404
00:24:52,094 --> 00:24:53,718
Why are the two of you here?

405
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:54,557
Welcome.

406
00:24:54,677 --> 00:24:56,041
What furniture are you looking for?

407
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,631
That...

408
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:01,267
I would like to see the most expensive bed in this shop.

409
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:03,730
A bed?

410
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,210
All right, we'll take care of you.
Please go around and have a look.

411
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,520
Yes.

412
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,359
This standard... should be quite expensive.

413
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:22,319
For a showroom like this, how much do you earn a month?

414
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:23,874
What?

415
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:28,094
No, if you came to look at furniture,
you should just look at furniture.

416
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,784
Why are you asking about their sales volume?

417
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:40,272
- Is this the most comfortable bed?
- Then, you'll have to lie down and try it out.

418
00:25:40,743 --> 00:25:41,652
That's right.

419
00:25:43,206 --> 00:25:44,499
Aigoo.

420
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:45,869
Aigoo.

421
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:49,135
I'm getting sleepy and comfortable.

422
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:52,229
Then, let's try it out by sleeping.

423
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:56,124
- Don't worry about us, just go about your business.
- That... Customers...

424
00:25:58,045 --> 00:26:00,002
Hurry and get up.

425
00:26:00,264 --> 00:26:03,198
Go wait at the coffee shop in front.
I'll get Ah Ran here.

426
00:26:03,318 --> 00:26:05,364
Hurry.

427
00:26:10,757 --> 00:26:11,909
What is this?

428
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,569
It's an investment flow report.

429
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:17,219
It shows how much money is needed to settle Soul.

430
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,381
That might be a little difficult.

431
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,220
Although I did agree to invest,

432
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,644
I can't just give money without principle.

433
00:26:27,773 --> 00:26:32,176
If we just make it through this difficult period,
everything will be smooth sailing from then on.

434
00:26:32,296 --> 00:26:35,268
Soul is about to provide furniture to the largest vacation resort in the country,

435
00:26:35,388 --> 00:26:38,307
and we're also in contact with buyers from China.

436
00:26:38,427 --> 00:26:40,278
Is that so?

437
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,326
All right.

438
00:26:45,446 --> 00:26:47,754
I've already introduced myself to President Shin Woo Sub.

439
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:50,234
Could there be any mistakes?

440
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,985
I'll deposit the money you need today.

441
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:56,575
Thank you.

442
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:59,143
I'll definitely not let you regret it.

443
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,470
[Yeon Jae ]

444
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,570
I've just sent them to the coffee shop in front.

445
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,387
You have to come and take care of this.

446
00:27:09,507 --> 00:27:12,723
I was so afraid Manager would find out
that my heart jumped into my mouth.

447
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:17,718
It's 10 million won.

448
00:27:18,076 --> 00:27:20,627
Take this money, hurry and leave.

449
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:23,841
If you appear one more time,

450
00:27:23,961 --> 00:27:26,111
I'll call the police.

451
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:28,068
Ah Ran,

452
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:32,089
did you think we came here just for the 10 million?

453
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:35,880
It was because we were worried how you were going to weather the difficulties.

454
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,731
It's because your family is here.

455
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:40,545
I didn't ask you to worry about me.

456
00:27:41,296 --> 00:27:43,986
Please live like you're dead.

457
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:48,388
People who sold their 18 year-old niece to a forty year-old man...

458
00:27:48,508 --> 00:27:50,011
Why are you talking about family now?

459
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:52,037
All right,

460
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,120
You don't seem to want to accept us as family.

461
00:27:57,681 --> 00:27:59,410
Then, we can't do anything.

462
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,354
Then, forget about finding out about where
your sister went your entire life.

463
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,218
What?

464
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,531
You know where our Kyeong Ran is?

465
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,234
Our Kyeong Ran is alive?

466
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,156
Where is she?

467
00:28:17,276 --> 00:28:19,856
Where is our Kyeong Ran?!

468
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:22,546
Why did you talk about Kyeong Ran?

469
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:26,651
We can't just pull her out of thin air.

470
00:28:27,491 --> 00:28:30,024
You don't treat us like people.

471
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:33,046
Why should we waste effort looking for Kyeong Ran?

472
00:28:35,317 --> 00:28:37,465
What did you do to my sister?

473
00:28:38,644 --> 00:28:39,989
It wasn't enough to do it to me.

474
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,046
What else did you do to that poor child?!

475
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,714
If you want to put it bluntly,

476
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:49,020
even if we did abandon the two of you,

477
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,146
you shouldn't be getting angry at us right now.

478
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:55,762
When your parents died, it wasn't as if they
died in a building in Myeong Dong.

479
00:28:55,882 --> 00:28:59,418
Why should we waste so much effort?

480
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:03,994
Help me find Kyeong Ran.

481
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,525
If you help me find Kyeong Ran,

482
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:09,848
if you want,

483
00:29:09,968 --> 00:29:12,416
I'll risk my life for you and give everything to you.

484
00:29:14,703 --> 00:29:18,039
I promised Mom and Dad I'd take care of Kyeong Ran.

485
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,297
Really?

486
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,795
You'll give us whatever we want?

487
00:29:24,502 --> 00:29:25,952
Then,

488
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,960
give us your brother-in-law's showroom.

489
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,956
Oh?

490
00:29:31,076 --> 00:29:34,327
What courage have you grown?

491
00:29:35,043 --> 00:29:36,650
We don't want anything else.

492
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,676
We just want that.

493
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,417
You pay for the coffee.

494
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:44,303
Let's go.

495
00:29:57,384 --> 00:29:59,026
Kyeong Ran.

496
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:16,470
Kyeong Ran is still alive.

497
00:30:17,658 --> 00:30:19,614
Our Kyeong Ran...

498
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:24,748
All right.

499
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,643
No matter what, I have to stay strong.

500
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:32,363
Once I find our Kyeong Ran,

501
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:35,672
I must show her my success.

502
00:30:38,821 --> 00:30:42,050
We won't go back to our poor and pathetic times.

503
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:44,111
Never.

504
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:48,684
President,

505
00:30:48,804 --> 00:30:51,549
someone sent you flowers.

506
00:30:54,972 --> 00:30:56,230
Who sent them?

507
00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:00,614
There's no name written, just the initials NNJ.

508
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:03,025
NNJ?

509
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,292
Never accept these flowers again.

510
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:18,300
Throw them away.

511
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,497
Also, if Nam Joo Seung ever comes looking for me,

512
00:31:21,617 --> 00:31:23,226
just say that I'm not here.

513
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,357
Understand?

514
00:31:25,477 --> 00:31:26,685
Yes.

515
00:31:30,979 --> 00:31:32,779
Mother.

516
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,857
I came here to ask you about something.

517
00:31:47,979 --> 00:31:50,303
Before Hyun Woo met with his accident,

518
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:52,940
were you dating Doctor Nam?

519
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:55,193
No.

520
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,342
You saw what just happened.

521
00:31:57,693 --> 00:32:00,034
It's Doctor Nam who has the one-sided feelings.

522
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,418
As Hyun Woo's wife, I am not ashamed at all.

523
00:32:05,117 --> 00:32:06,846
Please believe me.

524
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,446
Then I'll ask you something else.

525
00:32:13,202 --> 00:32:15,158
The day the villa caught fire,

526
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:19,562
why did you, who parted from me at 5:00,

527
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,829
leave Yang Pyeong at 7:00 in the evening?

528
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,706
Where were you and what did you do during those two hours?

529
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,378
Mother,

530
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:30,950
what is this?

531
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,535
What are you thinking right now?

532
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:38,271
Doctor Nam clearly did this.

533
00:32:38,742 --> 00:32:42,690
He's using these methods to threaten me because I didn't accept him.

534
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,170
That's right.

535
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:50,497
Even if we dig up the past, Hyun Woo is not here
anymore. What difference would it make?

536
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,387
But promise me something.

537
00:32:55,729 --> 00:32:57,424
If you really loved Hyun Woo,

538
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,433
Doctor Nam won't do.

539
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:04,009
To your father-in-law, Doctor Nam is a special person,

540
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,522
and the only person who got hurt because of this was you.

541
00:33:07,642 --> 00:33:09,566
I will remember that.

542
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:13,098
What you're worried about will never happen.

543
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:18,505
Joo Seung, are you such a clingy person?

544
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:21,142
Love involves two people.

545
00:33:21,631 --> 00:33:24,216
One-sided love is just obsession and violence.

546
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,007
What's wrong now?

547
00:33:26,127 --> 00:33:28,086
Did something happen?

548
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:31,911
You're even so childish as to send flowers.

549
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,426
Do you think anything will change between us?

550
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:39,545
Don't turn the beautiful memories from
the past three years into evil.

551
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:41,903
Please just end it here coolly.

552
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:46,790
Flowers?

553
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,240
I didn't send them.

554
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,899
Liar.

555
00:33:50,563 --> 00:33:53,899
You used the initials on our couple ring,
and you're still denying it?

556
00:33:54,705 --> 00:33:57,727
You were the one who sent Mother
the traffic violation too, right?

557
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:00,871
Tell me what you get out of telling her who set the fire.

558
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:02,164
It wasn't me.

559
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:05,438
If anyone intentionally sent anything, it must be Hyun Woo.

560
00:34:05,558 --> 00:34:08,355
- Shin Hyun Woo is dead.
- He's not dead.

561
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:13,051
The person who sent Madam from the
Yang Pyeong Villa to the hospital must be Hyun Woo.

562
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,753
Madam didn't see wrongly.

563
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:20,310
The only person who knows the initials on our couple ring
is Hyun Woo.

564
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:22,450
Even if Shin Hyun Woo is alive,

565
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,940
do you think I'll abandon everything in that family and leave?

566
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,125
Please wake up.

567
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:30,597
Before it gets more dangerous, leave that family.

568
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:32,457
This is your last chance.

569
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,665
You can't let go of my hand.

570
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:39,434
As long as you shut your mouth, I'll be fine.

571
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:42,560
I really didn't want to say this,

572
00:34:43,189 --> 00:34:45,512
but your wounded look is tiring.

573
00:34:47,194 --> 00:34:48,749
My wounds are already deep enough.

574
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,985
I can't breathe or think when I look at you.

575
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:52,732
Yes!

576
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,050
I had a rough life in this world.

577
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:58,784
I grew up alone without my mother.

578
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:04,243
My father worked his whole life under President as a secretary
and eventually died of illness.

579
00:35:06,673 --> 00:35:09,084
Someone who's never had parental love...

580
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,700
Isn't it normal to be dissatisfied with society?

581
00:35:13,783 --> 00:35:14,461
But...

582
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:19,467
they say that the flowers that grow deep
in the mines are beautiful too.

583
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,816
Even if your love has changed,

584
00:35:25,283 --> 00:35:27,344
don't insult my love.

585
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,346
How can I trust you?

586
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:40,648
If we meet danger, you'd step on me to get to safety.

587
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,736
Before you hurt me,

588
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:48,055
I have to make the first move.

589
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:12,275
<i>Tomorrow, I'll leave President's medicine to you.</i>

590
00:36:09,803 --> 00:36:11,515
{\a6}[Madam]

591
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:17,576
Madam.

592
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:21,978
Madam.

593
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,379
<i>I have Hyun Woo, Hyun Min... two sons.</i>

594
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:29,087
<i>You have no need to be worried about me.</i>

595
00:36:38,843 --> 00:36:40,520
Nurse Yoon,

596
00:36:41,062 --> 00:36:42,215
I'm sorry,

597
00:36:42,335 --> 00:36:43,874
but after you come to work tomorrow,

598
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:46,092
please deliver the President's medicine to Pyeong Chang Dong.

599
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:48,153
I'll leave the prescription on the table.

600
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:27,419
[Shin Woo Sub]

601
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:04,359
Nam Joo Seung.

602
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:07,176
The person who's helping me now,

603
00:38:07,805 --> 00:38:10,058
is not you, it's Ahn Jae Sung.

604
00:38:22,396 --> 00:38:25,366
Nurse Yoon, what are you doing here so early?

605
00:38:25,486 --> 00:38:28,871
Director wanted me to bring the President's medicine.

606
00:38:28,991 --> 00:38:31,089
We still have a lot of medicine.

607
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:33,045
Maybe the medicine changed.

608
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:36,731
We're going to change hospitals.
You don't have to work so hard in the future.

609
00:38:36,851 --> 00:38:38,337
Nurse Yoon,

610
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:41,185
because you came so early,
have some breakfast before you leave.

611
00:38:41,305 --> 00:38:43,700
No, it's fine.

612
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,167
It's all right. Have some before you leave.

613
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:47,421
It's just adding a pair of chopsticks.

614
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,053
I'll eat well.

615
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,577
Dad!

616
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:20,533
What's wrong? Dad!

617
00:39:23,843 --> 00:39:25,921
- Dad!
- Hyun Woo's dad! Hyun Woo's dad!

618
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:27,948
- Hyun Woo's dad!
- Dad!

619
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,288
Hurry and call an ambulance, hurry!

620
00:39:30,408 --> 00:39:32,175
Hyun Woo's dad!

621
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:45,180
<i>Hyung, what are you trying to do?</i>

622
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,259
<i>Are you trying to kill my father?</i>

623
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,076
<i>Why...</i>

624
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:49,861
<i>Why did you do it, why?!</i>

625
00:39:49,981 --> 00:39:51,695
What are you saying?

626
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,771
What?

627
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,593
Father.

628
00:40:07,388 --> 00:40:09,187
Ahjussi, something big happened.

629
00:40:10,969 --> 00:40:11,668
What?

630
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,851
Father fainted?

631
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:16,669
Ah, I know.

632
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,468
I'll call Joo Ah Ran and find out what happened.

633
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:20,128
Jae Hee, you go to the hospital.

634
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,416
I'm leaving Mom and Dad to you.

635
00:40:23,361 --> 00:40:24,968
After doing the tests,

636
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,483
it should be due to the side effects of the medicine.

637
00:40:27,603 --> 00:40:29,265
I looked at the prescription,

638
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:33,995
and there are fatal drugs that will cause patients
with high blood pressure to have breathing difficulties.

639
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:38,138
The doctor in charge probably made a mistake.

640
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,843
What mistake?

641
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:47,530
He has a current license.

642
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:51,827
How could the person who gave me medicine have made a mistake?

643
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:54,692
How could Joo Seung do something like that?

644
00:40:58,371 --> 00:40:59,716
President,

645
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,672
Are you all right? Are you awake?

646
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,891
You bastard.

647
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:08,299
Because you want Hyun Woo's wife,
you want to go as far as to kill me?

648
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:10,413
You evil fellow.

649
00:41:11,793 --> 00:41:13,993
What are you saying?

650
00:41:15,136 --> 00:41:18,175
After seeing this prescription,
you still want to make excuses?

651
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:20,743
No.

652
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:22,315
What?

653
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:25,581
I used the same prescription that I always use.

654
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,845
I got the medicine with the prescription on the table.

655
00:41:30,965 --> 00:41:33,570
You're playing around with your elders' health.

656
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:36,819
We'll change our doctor immediately. Please leave.

657
00:41:39,142 --> 00:41:41,083
<i>Nam Joo Seung,</i>

658
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:43,229
<i>how does it feel?</i>

659
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:46,672
<i>Now you're an enemy to this family too.</i>

660
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:49,938
<i>No one will believe anything you say.</i>

661
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:55,006
Yes President Ahn, I'll come see you as soon as possible.

662
00:41:57,154 --> 00:41:58,657
Tell me,

663
00:41:58,777 --> 00:42:01,556
what were you thinking coming up with a plan like this?

664
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:04,058
It was you who used Madam's name to send me a message.

665
00:42:04,178 --> 00:42:06,993
- I know.
- What did I do?

666
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,700
If it was as you said,

667
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,215
it should be the dead Shin Hyun Woo who did it.

668
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:15,602
It's not. Hyun Woo wouldn't do this to his father.

669
00:42:15,722 --> 00:42:17,250
Move aside.

670
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,132
I don't want people in the family to misunderstand needlessly.

671
00:42:25,637 --> 00:42:26,615
Get out!

672
00:42:26,735 --> 00:42:29,340
Hurry and get out!

673
00:42:38,145 --> 00:42:39,787
Hospital?

674
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:44,381
Doctor Nam broke up with me hatefully.

675
00:42:44,501 --> 00:42:47,438
It seems he played around with Father-in-law's medicine.

676
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:50,949
He's in the hospital because of the side effects.

677
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:55,353
As a doctor, he doesn't even have a basic conscience.

678
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:00,820
Clearly, it shows his love is deep.

679
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,828
But

680
00:43:03,212 --> 00:43:05,797
you get sick of flowers too.

681
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:09,116
Now his love is suffocating too.

682
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,752
Don't ever mention Doctor Nam in front of me again.

683
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:20,001
We don't have enough time just talking about the two of us.

684
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,287
Is it important who looks at me?

685
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:29,807
What's the most important is that I'm looking at you now.

686
00:43:30,802 --> 00:43:33,068
This is the first time

687
00:43:33,188 --> 00:43:36,160
I feel like a business partner can also be my life partner.

688
00:43:38,029 --> 00:43:40,422
Then, are we in a partnership?

689
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:43,898
The reward for a career

690
00:43:44,018 --> 00:43:46,906
is sweet red wine and a world for two people.

691
00:43:47,026 --> 00:43:49,579
The aim of a career

692
00:43:50,382 --> 00:43:52,845
is to snatch the heart of each other.

693
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:54,644
What do you think?

694
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:55,897
<i>From now on,</i>

695
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:59,076
you are the Romeo of my heart.

696
00:43:59,635 --> 00:44:01,923
The Romeo of your heart?

697
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:05,419
- Then what about you?
- The Juliet that's got her heart stolen?

698
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:08,790
Stealing hearts...

699
00:44:09,753 --> 00:44:12,915
Those words are charming, but a little scary.

700
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,247
If you don't want to have your heart stolen,

701
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:20,323
you have to steal someone else's heart.

702
00:44:30,129 --> 00:44:31,928
If you want to steal hearts,

703
00:44:32,048 --> 00:44:33,989
it's too bright here.

704
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:37,587
I'll prepare appropriate wine and set a date

705
00:44:37,707 --> 00:44:39,711
before calling you.

706
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:14,205
Your hospital is a little bigger than I thought it would be.

707
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:19,008
What are you doing at our hospital?

708
00:45:22,571 --> 00:45:24,877
Your hospital deed is in my hands.

709
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:29,471
President Joo said she needed money urgently,
and she gave it to me to help her handle it.

710
00:45:29,591 --> 00:45:32,528
But, I should listen to the hospital Director.

711
00:45:33,488 --> 00:45:37,087
President Joo gave you the hospital?

712
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,155
She provided the money.

713
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:44,877
Of course, we should proceed according to her wishes.

714
00:45:44,878 --> 00:45:46,313
Just handle it.

715
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,391
It's not like I'm lusting after the hospital.

716
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:50,173
Is that so?

717
00:45:51,954 --> 00:45:54,173
Then, I'll do as you wish.

718
00:45:55,098 --> 00:45:58,050
A paid doctor is more comfortable.

719
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,644
Then.

720
00:46:19,282 --> 00:46:22,793
His blood pressure is normal too.
I watched him eat before I came.

721
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,435
Is that so?

722
00:46:24,555 --> 00:46:26,322
That's good.

723
00:46:26,442 --> 00:46:28,750
Everyone had a bad scare, right?

724
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,915
Looking at your family,

725
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:34,513
I feel like having a family is really a good thing.

726
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:37,884
You worry about each other, are anxious,

727
00:46:38,146 --> 00:46:39,928
and grateful.

728
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:44,808
You have no family?

729
00:46:46,002 --> 00:46:48,412
I heard my parents passed away,

730
00:46:48,532 --> 00:46:50,578
and that I have an older sister.

731
00:46:50,698 --> 00:46:52,527
An older sister?

732
00:46:53,086 --> 00:46:55,706
Why didn't you tell me about your older sister?

733
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,601
No matter where she is, you should look for her.

734
00:47:00,355 --> 00:47:02,084
Let me meet the Director.

735
00:47:03,726 --> 00:47:07,534
President, just now, SM Company called.

736
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,525
Is that so?

737
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:12,035
Have you set up a meeting time with them?

738
00:47:12,155 --> 00:47:14,725
They say they don't want to meet and turned it down,

739
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,346
but they sent this over.

740
00:47:25,896 --> 00:47:27,887
[Merger Proposal]

741
00:47:29,127 --> 00:47:30,472
What?

742
00:47:30,592 --> 00:47:32,361
Merger?

743
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:35,362
Who's the boss there?

744
00:47:35,482 --> 00:47:37,406
Who in the world is it? To say crazy things like that...

745
00:47:37,526 --> 00:47:41,144
I asked around, I heard the boss is a woman named Jung Sang Hwa.

746
00:47:41,264 --> 00:47:42,384
Jung Sang Hwa?

747
00:47:42,504 --> 00:47:44,375
She came back from America not long ago

748
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,558
and started her business using her brother's designs.

749
00:47:46,678 --> 00:47:49,737
Her brother's name is Jung Sang Mo.

750
00:47:50,244 --> 00:47:51,973
What?

751
00:47:52,093 --> 00:47:53,895
Jung Sang Mo?

752
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:01,519
That SM representative

753
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:04,576
is Jung Sang Mo's sister?

754
00:48:11,003 --> 00:48:14,287
From the beginning, she watched me and planned how to act?

755
00:48:16,173 --> 00:48:18,129
This won't do.

756
00:48:18,741 --> 00:48:20,260
No.

757
00:48:22,968 --> 00:48:25,186
You gave me so much help at my hardest moment,

758
00:48:25,306 --> 00:48:27,671
yet I didn't come and visit you. I'm really sorry.

759
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,278
It's all right.

760
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:33,016
Compared to the help that Mr. Shin has given to our orphanage,

761
00:48:33,136 --> 00:48:35,462
I'm really ashamed.

762
00:48:36,957 --> 00:48:38,984
Actually...

763
00:48:39,892 --> 00:48:43,263
I came because I'm helping Jae Hee look for her family.

764
00:48:43,383 --> 00:48:45,813
I heard she has an older sister.

765
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:48,154
Do you know about this?

766
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:50,075
What to do?

767
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:52,747
I don't know anything.

768
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,420
Actually,

769
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,898
the person who brought Jae Hee here,

770
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,977
was Mr. Shin's mother.

771
00:49:00,097 --> 00:49:01,339
What?

772
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,260
My mother?

773
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,904
But your mother didn't seem to know where she grew up either.

774
00:49:08,884 --> 00:49:12,256
When Jae Hee came to our orphanage,
she was only three years old.

775
00:49:12,376 --> 00:49:16,186
How about looking in the child protection agencies in Seoul?

776
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:18,335
Yes.

777
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:23,105
Why did Mother bring Jae Hee...

778
00:49:24,747 --> 00:49:26,179
What reason...

779
00:49:30,153 --> 00:49:32,039
Are you sure it's here?

780
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,996
That's right.

781
00:49:34,116 --> 00:49:36,633
This is the biggest place in Seoul.

782
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:38,799
We brought her here because we were looking out for her.

783
00:49:38,919 --> 00:49:40,301
That's right, that's right.

784
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,856
Joo, Kyeong Ran, right?

785
00:49:46,976 --> 00:49:48,254
Yes.

786
00:49:48,374 --> 00:49:51,625
We abandoned her at the doorstep 25 years ago.

787
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:53,866
This...

788
00:49:53,986 --> 00:49:56,014
Not abandoned.

789
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:00,663
We had to leave here temporarily because our lives were too hard.

790
00:50:00,783 --> 00:50:03,895
Now we're here to look for her and seek forgiveness.

791
00:50:06,797 --> 00:50:08,351
Yes, here.

792
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,343
Joo Kyeong Ran,

793
00:50:10,463 --> 00:50:13,120
a girl of 21 months.

794
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,605
Right?

795
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,560
Right, right.

796
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,643
That's right!

797
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,105
Is that child still here?

798
00:50:22,225 --> 00:50:23,992
According to the records here,

799
00:50:24,112 --> 00:50:26,682
it only says that a welfare home took her.

800
00:50:26,802 --> 00:50:28,079
What?

801
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,560
Which welfare house was it?

802
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,429
It doesn't say.

803
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:37,171
Oh, my... What does that mean?

804
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,760
Was she adopted or sent overseas?

805
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,188
There should be a record.

806
00:50:43,308 --> 00:50:47,223
How could people do things so unclearly?

807
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:48,725
Back then,

808
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:51,816
a lot of people didn't like others to find out about their adoption.

809
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:55,432
So they probably didn't leave anything on purpose.

810
00:50:56,115 --> 00:51:00,517
Here, it says that she kept looking for her sister,

811
00:51:00,637 --> 00:51:03,242
and that she liked red leather shoes a lot.

812
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:08,342
This thing concerns life or death.

813
00:51:08,462 --> 00:51:11,598
Please ask around a little more, and you must inform me.

814
00:51:14,552 --> 00:51:16,526
These are really strange people.

815
00:51:16,646 --> 00:51:19,041
They should have just raised her honestly.
Why did they give her to someone else?

816
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:21,067
We could have just found her.

817
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:22,343
Who decides?

818
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:25,574
They didn't even record the phone number of the person who adopted her.

819
00:51:25,694 --> 00:51:28,144
Oh, that scared me.

820
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:33,408
- It's like he's never driven before.
- Exactly.

821
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:35,836
I'm really sorry. Are you all right?

822
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:38,039
Drive properly!

823
00:51:39,174 --> 00:51:40,712
Let's go.

824
00:51:41,218 --> 00:51:43,856
Where should we to find Kyeong Ran?

825
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:47,823
There are no records of a child called Yoon Jae Hee.

826
00:51:48,155 --> 00:51:51,282
Maybe, she was left at a different agency.

827
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:56,075
Yes, I understand.

828
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:01,368
Is that true?

829
00:52:02,591 --> 00:52:03,901
If you don't believe me,

830
00:52:04,021 --> 00:52:07,097
you can go to the police station to verify it.

831
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:10,816
Because my brother killed himself,
the police investigated it too.

832
00:52:11,392 --> 00:52:12,440
Then,

833
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,235
during that period of time, all the furniture that
Soul used based on Sister-in-law's designs...

834
00:52:15,355 --> 00:52:17,939
They were copies of your brother's designs?

835
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:22,291
I'm uncovering your sister-in-law's crimes for my brother.

836
00:52:22,899 --> 00:52:25,396
How you're going to compensate SM Furniture...

837
00:52:25,516 --> 00:52:27,877
Discuss it with Joo Ah Ran before letting me know.

838
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:29,554
Then, I'm leaving.

839
00:52:43,518 --> 00:52:44,986
<i>Look at this.</i>

840
00:52:45,106 --> 00:52:47,885
<i>The child kept looking for you.</i>

841
00:52:48,217 --> 00:52:52,601
<i>The agency had a photograph, so I photocopied it for you.</i>

842
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:59,128
She kept looking for her sister.

843
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:06,619
She especially liked red leather shoes.

844
00:53:13,553 --> 00:53:15,300
Kyeong Ran.

845
00:53:18,347 --> 00:53:19,954
Kyeong Ran.

846
00:53:29,304 --> 00:53:32,012
No matter where you are, just stay alive.

847
00:53:33,514 --> 00:53:36,752
I will definitely look for you.

848
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,374
Who is Jung Sang Mo?

849
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,316
Brother-in-law.

850
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:02,534
I just met Jung Sang Hwa,

851
00:54:03,058 --> 00:54:04,910
so I heard everything.

852
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:07,652
What relationship did you have with Jung Sang Mo?

853
00:54:07,772 --> 00:54:11,176
How did you steal all of Jung Sang Mo's designs?

854
00:54:11,296 --> 00:54:12,573
It's not true.

855
00:54:12,693 --> 00:54:14,844
That woman is lying.

856
00:54:16,014 --> 00:54:17,909
It's that side who is lusting after Soul's designs.

857
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:19,691
That's why they're getting close to you.

858
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:21,629
You can't get involved.

859
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:23,485
At this point,

860
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:25,494
I really hate Hyung.

861
00:54:26,525 --> 00:54:28,830
How could I love someone like you?

862
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,485
If he was here, I would really beat him up.

863
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:34,035
Because of all your lies,

864
00:54:34,155 --> 00:54:36,620
I'm resenting my brother who passed away.

865
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,048
This is all because of you!

866
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,491
Snap out of it, Joo Ah Ran.

867
00:54:55,216 --> 00:54:57,382
You can't fall like this.

868
00:54:58,606 --> 00:55:01,034
You have to find Kyeong Ran

869
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,829
and bring her in front of Dad and Mom.

870
00:55:03,949 --> 00:55:06,187
Before that, you have no right to die.

871
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:13,313
You have to overcome the hurdles of Shin Woo Sub and Jung Sang Hwa.

872
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:17,470
If you don't want to get chased out by Shin Woo Sub,

873
00:55:18,994 --> 00:55:21,422
you have to find his fatal flaw.

874
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:29,719
President Hwang is someone who knows Joo Ah Ran's past.

875
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,015
Through that person,

876
00:55:31,135 --> 00:55:34,142
unveiling Joo Ah Ran's mask should be interesting.

877
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:36,133
Can you help me, Julie Jung?

878
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,194
Go ahead and do it.

879
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:40,674
I have a classmate who is close to President Hwang.

880
00:55:40,794 --> 00:55:42,491
I'll arrange the situation.

881
00:55:42,611 --> 00:55:45,460
Soon, there will be a merger of SM
Furniture and Soul Furniture.

882
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,766
I've sent over the merger proposal,

883
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,516
but there's been no response from Joo Ah Ran.

884
00:55:50,883 --> 00:55:55,634
Soul will eventually leave the hands of Joo Ah Ran and will be mine.

885
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:04,100
Thanks for the investment funds that you sent over.

886
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,336
But what is the matter?

887
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,498
After I made the investment, I was worried.

888
00:56:10,685 --> 00:56:13,969
I compared the news about SM Furniture and Soul Furniture.

889
00:56:14,524 --> 00:56:17,389
The designs are very similar,
but the prices are ridiculously expensive.

890
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,389
{\a6}[Soul Furniture and SM Furniture with similar designs,
but Soul Furniture is double the price.]

891
00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:19,624
They're criticizing Soul.

892
00:56:22,175 --> 00:56:23,738
Don't worry.

893
00:56:23,858 --> 00:56:26,358
This SM Furniture is not a competitor.

894
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:28,605
If there's a chance,

895
00:56:28,725 --> 00:56:31,312
we're planning on suing them for stealing our designs.

896
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:35,120
But, you can't neglect the power of media.

897
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:36,518
In the report,

898
00:56:36,638 --> 00:56:39,137
it says Soul is stealing the designs.

899
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:43,259
I don't know if consumers will trust the words of President Joo.

900
00:56:44,422 --> 00:56:47,863
I will immediately go see the President of SM and issue her a warning.

901
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:52,807
I heard the rumors that her dead brother is a furniture designer

902
00:56:52,927 --> 00:56:55,811
and their president is a rookie in the furniture business.

903
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:58,274
We'll see how long they can hold out.

904
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:02,519
At least you have your confidence.

905
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:06,090
As long as I gain back my investment funds,

906
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:09,286
I can leave confidently.

907
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:25,248
[Myungsung Electronics: Believe its fraud]

908
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:33,178
President Hwang?

909
00:57:35,669 --> 00:57:38,709
Find out what's happening with Hyun Woo's wife.

910
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:41,259
If you don't find a decisive weakness,

911
00:57:41,379 --> 00:57:43,687
she won't back down quietly.

912
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:45,380
Yes, President.

913
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,340
That's right,

914
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,856
the young brother of the manager of Joo Jang Chun factory

915
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:51,004
and his wife were released from prison not long ago.

916
00:57:51,124 --> 00:57:52,559
Is that so?

917
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:54,655
Find out where they live.

918
00:58:01,949 --> 00:58:03,713
Hello.

919
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:07,329
I heard you were sick, and got a shock.
It's fortunate that you're all right.

920
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:10,735
Aigoo, a busy person came to see me.

921
00:58:10,855 --> 00:58:12,063
I'm really grateful.

922
00:58:12,183 --> 00:58:14,263
I didn't even know you were sick.

923
00:58:14,383 --> 00:58:16,499
I just found out.

924
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,613
I'm good friends with President Hwang of Myeong Sung Electronics.

925
00:58:19,733 --> 00:58:21,726
He heard it was a company I was investing in,

926
00:58:21,846 --> 00:58:24,678
and said he had to meet you.

927
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:26,669
President Hwang?

928
00:58:27,597 --> 00:58:32,208
I heard he's a friend of Shin Woo's wife's father.

929
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:33,920
That...

930
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:38,305
I'm getting discharged tomorrow. Arrange a meeting with him.

931
00:58:39,073 --> 00:58:40,540
Can I do that?

932
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:44,209
Tomorrow, at 6:00 in the evening, please come to the Seoul Hotel.

933
00:58:44,879 --> 00:58:47,814
It's been a long time since we've eaten together.

934
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:50,661
I have important business to talk about.

935
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:53,561
You can look forward to it.

936
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,081
Tomorrow, at 6:00 in the evening,

937
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,033
please come to the ChungDamDong Hotel
that Joo Ah Ran used to work at.

938
00:58:58,153 --> 00:59:00,932
I'll arrange everything else and will be waiting.

939
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:24,614
Yes. This is Beautiful Hospital.

940
00:59:24,734 --> 00:59:26,675
Have you checked the security records?

941
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:27,601
<i>Yes.</i>

942
00:59:27,721 --> 00:59:31,251
<i>The first security alarm was set at 7:30 pm.
and then disabled two minutes later.</i>

943
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:34,885
<i>It was disabled using a password. That's why we didn't take action.</i>

944
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:38,013
All right, I understand.

945
00:59:42,153 --> 00:59:44,406
Joo Ah Ran, it was really you.

946
00:59:45,387 --> 00:59:48,356
The only person that can deactivate the code

947
00:59:48,476 --> 00:59:50,207
is you.

948
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:57,611
Welcome.

949
00:59:57,731 --> 00:59:59,515
I'm Julie Jung.

950
00:59:59,635 --> 01:00:02,257
Where is the President?

951
01:00:02,377 --> 01:00:06,519
There is an important guest that is coming from
overseas for the President, so he didn't come.

952
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:08,391
I came by myself. Are you disappointed?

953
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:10,697
No, how can that be?

954
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:12,706
It's an honor to meet you.

955
01:00:12,826 --> 01:00:15,955
What's the reason you called the two of us here?

956
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,818
Wait and see.

957
01:00:18,938 --> 01:00:20,180
Madam

958
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,849
has to take revenge at least once.

959
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,211
Revenge?

960
01:00:42,656 --> 01:00:46,132
President Shin really wanted to meet President Hwang,

961
01:00:46,252 --> 01:00:48,001
so it was such a pity.

962
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:49,617
Since Madam is here,

963
01:00:49,737 --> 01:00:51,958
you should ask her anything you want to.

964
01:00:52,078 --> 01:00:53,809
Actually,

965
01:00:53,929 --> 01:00:57,792
I wanted to meet you because I had something
I wanted to ask about my daughter-in-law.

966
01:00:57,912 --> 01:01:01,495
President Hwang said he knows her very well.

967
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,552
Not just well.

968
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,711
I heard she married into a furniture
company, so it's Soul Furniture.

969
01:01:09,043 --> 01:01:11,086
Taking that kind of woman as your daughter-in-law...

970
01:01:11,206 --> 01:01:14,021
President Shin is really great.

971
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:15,603
That kind of woman?

972
01:01:15,723 --> 01:01:18,380
Looks like President Shin isn't a man.

973
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,922
Is there a man in Seoul that doesn't know Rosemary?

974
01:01:23,553 --> 01:01:25,300
The fox among all foxes that seduced our family's President,

975
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,868
despite his love for his wife.

976
01:01:28,392 --> 01:01:30,051
Rosemary?

977
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:32,741
Who's Rosemary?

978
01:01:41,892 --> 01:01:43,429
That...

979
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,698
That...

980
01:01:46,187 --> 01:01:48,755
How could that happen?!

981
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:55,080
Welcome, President.

982
01:01:55,657 --> 01:01:57,805
You've been well, right?

983
01:02:03,342 --> 01:02:07,700
You still have the guts to meet me?

984
01:02:09,101 --> 01:02:12,909
That day, you were the one who took my passport and my ticket, right?

985
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:15,599
I also knew you didn't get on the plane that day.

986
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:18,201
Are you still angry about that?

987
01:02:19,059 --> 01:02:21,068
Stop being angry.

988
01:02:22,832 --> 01:02:24,736
You evil fellow.

989
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:27,653
Today, I won't let you just leave obediently.

990
01:02:27,773 --> 01:02:30,343
I have to get rid this anger.

991
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:32,526
You'd better be prepared.

992
01:02:34,902 --> 01:02:37,644
I have guests coming. Will you be all right?

993
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:41,117
Guests?

994
01:02:45,134 --> 01:02:48,139
To expose the special relationship between President and I,

995
01:02:48,259 --> 01:02:50,626
I called a few reporters.

996
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,853
The information that you asked me to steal

997
01:02:54,973 --> 01:02:58,452
about Sae May Electronics' new products... Here is the evidence.

998
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:03,144
In this memory card, there are the emails
that the President and I exchanged.

999
01:03:10,451 --> 01:03:11,848
And this

1000
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:15,499
is the investment contract that Myeong Sung
Electronics has with Soul Furniture.

1001
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,154
How about you take this opportunity to invest in Soul Furniture

1002
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:20,634
and become business partners with me?

1003
01:03:21,315 --> 01:03:23,726
The choice is in the hands of President.

1004
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:28,110
Come clean that you're an immoral
businessman in front of the reporters, or

1005
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,870
appear as Soul's investor.

1006
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:33,071
No matter what decision you make,

1007
01:03:33,191 --> 01:03:35,464
I'll listen to the President.

1008
01:03:38,973 --> 01:03:40,824
I've been...

1009
01:03:41,261 --> 01:03:44,422
so nice to you, that I didn't know this was an evil road.

1010
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:49,091
You think you can play me with this game?

1011
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:54,281
Oh,

1012
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,181
we heard that President Hwang and President Joo have a special deal.

1013
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,036
Is that true?

1014
01:03:58,156 --> 01:04:00,115
What are the contents of the deal. Could you tell us in detail?

1015
01:04:04,113 --> 01:04:05,108
Are you crazy?

1016
01:04:05,228 --> 01:04:08,025
If you don't want to die, get rid of the reporters!

1017
01:04:08,532 --> 01:04:10,715
If you don't want to invest,

1018
01:04:10,835 --> 01:04:13,126
then just come clean with the memory disk.

1019
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:16,575
We should also reveal that the President is my sponsor.

1020
01:04:17,885 --> 01:04:19,579
I have nothing to lose anymore.

1021
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:21,693
Do you think I'll agree to that?

1022
01:04:21,813 --> 01:04:24,033
Business is not child's play!

1023
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:26,764
Soul Furniture

1024
01:04:26,884 --> 01:04:29,087
is a company with huge potential.

1025
01:04:30,048 --> 01:04:32,318
Compared to the investments you made on my body,

1026
01:04:32,438 --> 01:04:34,781
this should be a better deal for you.

1027
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,516
Because of Myeong Sung Electronics' large investment,

1028
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,455
in the future, our Soul Furniture,

1029
01:04:47,575 --> 01:04:50,372
will develop to become the best furniture company.

1030
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,723
With Myeong Sung Electronics backing me,

1031
01:05:24,146 --> 01:05:26,329
no one can do anything to me.

1032
01:05:27,901 --> 01:05:30,102
Father and Ahn Jae Sung

1033
01:05:30,222 --> 01:05:32,478
all have to do as I say.

1034
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:41,346
- Hurry and get in the car.
- Let go.

1035
01:05:42,237 --> 01:05:43,844
We're done.

1036
01:05:43,964 --> 01:05:46,010
There's nothing more I have to say to you.

1037
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,210
You and I!

1038
01:05:48,596 --> 01:05:51,408
It's not over unless one of us dies!

1039
01:05:52,352 --> 01:05:54,587
No matter how you step on me, lie to me...

1040
01:05:54,707 --> 01:05:56,674
I can't let you go.

1041
01:05:56,794 --> 01:05:59,679
No, I'll love you more.

1042
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:03,591
Listen to me!

1043
01:06:04,412 --> 01:06:06,404
I like Ahn Jae Sung.

1044
01:06:07,844 --> 01:06:10,342
If you're helping me take revenge,

1045
01:06:10,462 --> 01:06:13,032
then Ahn Jae Sung's the one who will help me succeed.

1046
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:16,980
The time spent with you was torture.

1047
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:20,134
I want to be happy.

1048
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,068
I'm living by using my strength to snatch Soul away

1049
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,422
as compensation for the days my sister and I spent.

1050
01:06:27,405 --> 01:06:29,309
So you

1051
01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:32,069
and the misfortune should vanish from before my eyes.

1052
01:07:11,025 --> 01:07:12,387
I'm back.

1053
01:07:12,507 --> 01:07:14,343
I'm a little late.

1054
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:18,763
Dirty person!

1055
01:07:19,164 --> 01:07:20,544
Father!

1056
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:23,055
Who is Rosemary?

1057
01:07:23,824 --> 01:07:26,444
All the men in Seoul know

1058
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:29,675
who Rosemary is.

1064
01:07:51,182 --> 01:07:52,667
<i>I don't admit that you're my daughter-in-law!</i>

1065
01:07:52,787 --> 01:07:54,851
Even if he leaps over with a knife,
I'm not in the least bit frightened.

1066
01:07:54,971 --> 01:07:56,964
- What ring is this?
- It's a couple ring!

1067
01:07:57,084 --> 01:07:59,347
<i>The woman who was sitting in Hyun Woo's car was you, right?</i>

1068
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,146
- Wait and see.
- Mother, you should leave.

1069
01:08:01,266 --> 01:08:03,574
You take over Soul and develop it.

1070
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:04,936
<i>I want to live as your woman.</i>

1071
01:08:05,056 --> 01:08:07,312
Taking over someone else's woman,
do you think you'll be happy?

1072
01:08:07,432 --> 01:08:08,884
A child that was abandoned by his mother...

1073
01:08:09,004 --> 01:08:10,572
What can he grow up to be?

1074
01:08:10,692 --> 01:08:13,800
Should I take this opportunity to say
how Hyun Woo met with his accident?

1075
01:08:13,801 --> 01:08:17,330
<i>Shall I also reveal that the manager
of Joo Jung Chun Factory was your father?</i>

1076
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,578
<i>Joo Seung's birth parents!</i>

1077
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:22,141
He wanted to use my parents' death to crush that family.

1078
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:25,320
<i>In the end, Joo Ah Ran and Nam Joo Seung's
battle will only get more heated.</i>

1079
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:26,735
The war starts now.

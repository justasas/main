Temptation Of An Angel 

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,307
Episode 18

3
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:13,177
Jae Sung, we've fallen into a trap.

4
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,764
Everybody is maligning me!

5
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:18,266
<i>I told you clearly.</i>

6
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,469
Shin Hyun Woo died
in a gas explosion.

7
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,483
I wasn't there then!

8
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:24,943
I had nothing to do with
the traffic accident either.

9
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:26,363
What...

10
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:28,229
if I don't believe you?

11
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:30,274
You have to believe me.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,575
We don't need the wedding ceremony.

13
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:37,037
Let's leave!

14
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:38,988
Let's go.

15
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:41,680
You took someone's life!

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,168
Do you want to just run away like that?

17
00:00:45,054 --> 00:00:47,876
<i>You actually thought
you can stand here, blissful.</i>

18
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,908
How shameless and hateful.

19
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:53,719
I must...

20
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,427
make the crimes that you committed,
crawl out of your mouth like worms.

21
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,205
Till the day you die.

22
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:04,258
You have to pay for
your crimes till you die.

23
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,141
Who are you?

24
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:10,057
Do you still not know?

25
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:14,933
The Romeo who lost his heart,

26
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:17,350
the person you killed,

27
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:19,697
your husband,
Shin Hyun Woo.

28
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:31,860
That's right.

29
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,213
This person here, is Shin Hyun Woo.

30
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,117
He underwent plastic surgery
because of serious burn injuries.

31
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:39,378
But, he is definitely Shin Hyun Woo.

32
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,561
I'm the witness.

33
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,222
Now, you know?

34
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,754
The Ahn Jae Sung you loved,

35
00:01:50,874 --> 00:01:53,574
is the Shin Hyun Woo you killed.

36
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,390
The Ahn Jae Sung who was going to save you,

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,680
didn't exist right from the beginning,

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,621
only the Shin Hyun Woo
who was stabbing you in the back.

39
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,763
No.

40
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,904
No.

41
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:13,425
You're not Shin Hyun Woo.

42
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:16,584
You're Ahn Jae Sung.

43
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,188
Tell me.

44
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:24,002
You're the Ahn Jae Sung I loved, tell me!

45
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:27,542
Wake up and face reality!

46
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:34,038
I wanted you to feel it in your bones,

47
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:39,770
the feeling that living
is more painful than dying.

48
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,560
If the law can't do it...

49
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,176
I'll do it.

50
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,294
Is that so?

51
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,619
To take revenge on me,

52
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:04,886
with your body full of stab wounds,
you became another person.

53
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,041
You hated me to the point where your face,

54
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:14,464
your blood and heart
had to be replaced.

55
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,344
Or,

56
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,396
did you love me that much?

57
00:03:22,516 --> 00:03:24,579
Shut your mouth!

58
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,451
The moment when I return to Shin Hyun Woo,

59
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:32,422
it's over.

60
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:37,023
There are a lot of reporters
outside the house.

61
00:03:37,143 --> 00:03:39,249
<i>Outside this hotel,</i>

62
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:42,514
<i>there are police officers
waiting to shoot you.</i>

63
00:03:43,347 --> 00:03:45,680
Just as long as I say one word,

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,588
tomorrow,

65
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,408
it'll be all over the news.

66
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,613
<i>Your life,</i>

67
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:55,947
<i>will be unsalvageable.</i>

68
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,958
I'll give you one last chance to repent.

69
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:03,495
Now, you walk out by yourself,

70
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:07,182
spill out everything,
and confess to the police.

71
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:12,122
Confess your own crimes with your own mouth.

72
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,169
That would reduce half of your sins.

73
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:20,834
Make your own choice.

74
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:23,505
You're really cruel.

75
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:31,618
Will you only be happy and give up, after
you've pushed me into a bottomless pit?

76
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:35,647
All right.

77
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,726
If that's what you want,

78
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,355
I'll do as you wish.

79
00:04:45,694 --> 00:04:48,853
Then, how content you'll become,

80
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:54,154
I want to see it with my own eyes.

81
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,988
What big news could there be?

82
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:21,917
Making us wait like that?

83
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,207
All right, let's just wait it out.

84
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:27,536
It seems like something
interesting is happening in there.

85
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:35,261
Father.

86
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,614
Mother.

87
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:40,158
You...

88
00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,491
No, you...

89
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:46,402
Really are Hyun Woo?

90
00:05:46,522 --> 00:05:49,339
My son, Hyun Woo, am I right?

91
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,947
Yes, that's right.

92
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:55,093
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:57,866
This time, I've been pretending not to know.

94
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:01,411
Please forgive me,
I could only do this.

95
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,404
You horrible fellow.

96
00:06:04,248 --> 00:06:06,347
Are you an orphan?

97
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,525
When were you going to leave your
dad out of the loop, before you told me?

98
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:14,345
Was I that untrustworthy?

99
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:15,756
Hyun Woo.

100
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:20,187
It's our Hyun Woo.

101
00:06:20,886 --> 00:06:22,286
This gaze,

102
00:06:23,473 --> 00:06:25,275
this smell,

103
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:27,735
<i>it's our Hyun Woo, that's right.</i>

104
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,474
My son!

105
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:34,096
Mother.

106
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,035
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,092
I came back in this manner.

108
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,572
<i>I missed you this much,</i>

109
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,092
I thought about coming
back a few times a day,

110
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,285
but I couldn't return weakly,
without having done anything.

111
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:55,540
Then, you should also
tell Mother that you're alive.

112
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,804
Did you know that Mom's heart
was on fire, why did you do that?

113
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:04,430
Why did you have to bear it
by yourself, like a fool?

114
00:07:12,822 --> 00:07:14,433
What should we do?

115
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,959
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

116
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:18,174
No, I can't.

117
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,994
The guilty person isn't me,
it's Shin Woo Sub.

118
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,729
That person is still alive and free.

119
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:26,612
<i>He can't pin all the crimes on me.</i>

120
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,629
That Shin Hyun Woo that looks so righteous,

121
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:32,982
that dirty blood is also
flowing through his body.

122
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:35,187
But we can't get away now.

123
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:38,346
From the front, and the back,
they're all watching us.

124
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:44,772
Leave it to me.

125
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,097
All right, brother-in-law,

126
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:50,941
since this is the case,

127
00:07:51,061 --> 00:07:54,078
I'll go see the police
and tell them everything.

128
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,301
But, let me change before that.

129
00:07:57,873 --> 00:08:00,862
I can't let the police interrogate
me when I'm in this state.

130
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,134
You should accede to that request, right?

131
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:06,420
You can see the police
are oustide everywhere, right?

132
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,194
Don't even dream about playing tricks.

133
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,738
You can't run anywhere.

134
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:34,615
No matter what, we have to escape from here.

135
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:38,749
As long as we get on a plane to America,
Shin Hyun Woo can't do anything about it.

136
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,106
What time is the plane?

137
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,272
7.

138
00:08:41,392 --> 00:08:44,144
We can handle all the procedures
as long as we leave right now.

139
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:45,267
All right.

140
00:08:45,387 --> 00:08:47,197
Looking at the situation,
I'll leave with you.

141
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:51,041
Change your clothes first, I'll go see
if there's a door that leads out from here.

142
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:07,858
That's right.

143
00:09:07,978 --> 00:09:10,084
I'll avoid this storm first.

144
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:15,001
Now, if the police looks into everything,
things will look bad for me.

145
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:18,478
To look for the sister I
haven't seen in 25 years,

146
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,328
I can't go to jail.

147
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,717
- Who are you?
- Get my handbag here now.

148
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:27,540
- What?
- Now!

149
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:28,791
Ah, yes.

150
00:09:36,374 --> 00:09:37,392
It's me.

151
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,814
Have you found a way out?

152
00:09:41,404 --> 00:09:44,563
All right. I'll go there right now.

153
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,765
Is Joo Ah Ran still in there?

154
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,631
She just left.

155
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,924
What?

156
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,324
Stand there!

157
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:44,232
Joo Ah Ran!

158
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,790
If you take this, you will see an exit.

159
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,737
Get out from there, and take
the car to Angel Orphanage.

160
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,348
And go straight to the airport.

161
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,023
What about you, Joo Seung?

162
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,631
I don't think I can leave with you.

163
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:04,666
You leave first.

164
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:08,391
No matter what,
you can never get caught.

165
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:10,002
Understand?

166
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,482
Joo Ah Ran! Stay there,
hurry and come out!

167
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,623
I'm going to grit my teeth.

168
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,890
Today, no matter if you're my Hyung,

169
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,840
because of my brother,

170
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,854
I'm not going to let you off!

171
00:12:47,202 --> 00:12:48,898
You can't go.

172
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,214
You can't go.

173
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,141
You can't go!

174
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:40,494
What's going on?
My passport, my air ticket!

175
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,250
I clearly left it here.

176
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,929
Are you looking for this?

177
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:57,816
What are you doing?

178
00:13:57,936 --> 00:13:59,385
Give it to me.

179
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,441
Where are you running away to like a coward?

180
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:05,930
Your crimes cannot even be counted,
you don't even have a sense of shame,

181
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,734
and you want to run away to
a different country to live freely?

182
00:14:08,854 --> 00:14:09,824
That,

183
00:14:09,944 --> 00:14:12,947
even I, who was beside Shin Hyun Woo
watching him suffer, cannot forgive.

184
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,067
Stay out of it.

185
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,654
Are you Shin Hyun Woo's wife?

186
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:20,219
This is something that Shin Hyun Woo,
his family and I have to settle.

187
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,555
Third parties should stay out of it!

188
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:23,484
Then you should settle
everything before you leave.

189
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,871
Stop pretending to be someone
else so cheaply and running away,

190
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,246
it doesn't seem like Joo Ah Ran.

191
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:36,433
No! No!

192
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:41,818
What are you to, involve yourself
in someone else's business?!

193
00:14:41,938 --> 00:14:44,749
Don't touch my woman!

194
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,594
What?

195
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,277
Your woman?

196
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,249
Listen clearly.

197
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:54,471
Yoon Jae Hee,
is a woman I love.

198
00:14:55,341 --> 00:15:01,248
As much as you toy with my life,
I won't allow you to touch my woman.

199
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:06,569
Don't use those cruel hands
of yours to touch a hair of my woman's.

200
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,898
I'm not that Shin Hyun Woo
you played around with.

201
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,248
Joo Ah Ran!

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,128
Let's take a trip to the police station.

203
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:20,136
We'll have a joint interrogation
with Shin Hyun Woo.

204
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:21,493
No.

205
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:26,730
If you turned yourself in,
I was going to leave you a way out.

206
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,231
But you kept walking
towards the gates of hell.

207
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:30,631
I had no other choice.

208
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:33,489
If you wish, I'll walk with you.

209
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:36,330
Take her away please.

210
00:15:41,068 --> 00:15:43,803
Let me go.
Let me go!

211
00:15:46,284 --> 00:15:49,082
Ahjusshi, I have to go back to the hotel.

212
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:52,803
I've made an appointment with my Unnie,
and the time has passed.

213
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,542
All right. Go.

214
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,920
After you meet your Unnie, give me a call.

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,256
All right.

216
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:10,037
Hyung, turn him over to the police too.

217
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:12,502
<i>He's the same person.</i>

218
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:15,809
<i>There's no reason to think about it anymore.</i>

219
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:23,192
Do you really have to do this?

220
00:16:23,312 --> 00:16:26,542
She was the one who abandoned
me and put on a wedding dress.

221
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:27,878
But,

222
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:30,931
do you really have to get
the police to waste her like that?

223
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,956
Even though you and
Joo Ah Ran failed at killing me,

224
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:38,966
I have no intention of
giving in to you at all.

225
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:41,749
<i>Although you wanted to
leave the country and hide,</i>

226
00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:44,908
there is no place for you to
run and hide anymore!

227
00:16:45,417 --> 00:16:46,604
All right.

228
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,487
We will be punished.

229
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:53,491
But, give us some time to cool down,

230
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,205
<i>And, for this woman who loved you,</i>

231
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:58,601
and had your baby,
is that too much to ask?

232
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:00,043
<i>No!</i>

233
00:17:00,163 --> 00:17:02,475
Now, drag them away right
now and convict them!

234
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:05,083
There's no reason to
drag it out any further.

235
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:06,503
<i>Get in the car.</i>

236
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,387
Hold on.

237
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:14,939
The other party wants to
savor her pain slowly.

238
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:21,088
Then, letting them get what they want,
is not a big deal.

239
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:23,791
I'll see them tomorrow
at the police station.

240
00:17:36,112 --> 00:17:37,235
Ah.

241
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,627
What is this?

242
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:44,473
Today is our Ah Ran's wedding.

243
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:48,014
Aigoo, she didn't call us,
what wedding could it be?

244
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:49,752
Isn't it written here?

245
00:17:49,872 --> 00:17:52,000
Groom, Ahn Jae Sung,
Bride Joo Ah Ran.

246
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,642
Oh my.

247
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,119
Looks like the important thing she
was talking about was her wedding.

248
00:17:57,239 --> 00:17:58,688
What a shameless creature.

249
00:17:58,808 --> 00:18:01,232
Then she should at least have
called us over for some pork rib soup.

250
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:04,797
Just, letting us wait
blindly for Kyeong Ran.

251
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,313
Oh, what is going on?

252
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:10,069
Is it all right for her to marry
another guy while living at her in-laws?

253
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,129
Then,

254
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:13,790
wouldn't she be chased out of
her Director position at Soul Furniture?

255
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,313
Oh, that's right.

256
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,082
Where are the guests looking for Kyeong Ran?

257
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:27,842
Kyeong Ran?

258
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,616
They were just here, maybe they left?

259
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,634
What?

260
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:35,156
I left a message asking them to wait.

261
00:18:35,276 --> 00:18:38,548
Could she have left a message when she left?

262
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,392
<i>There isn't anything.</i>

263
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:41,834
Yes.

264
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,960
You have to wipe your face.

265
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,131
I'll go get you something.

266
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,881
What are you doing right now?

267
00:19:58,001 --> 00:19:59,174
Let me go!

268
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:01,159
I don't want to live!

269
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,622
Stop now, do you hear me?!

270
00:20:02,742 --> 00:20:04,784
Just let me go!

271
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,456
This world was never on my side!

272
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:11,104
Even if I struggled so hard to live,
the result was the same.

273
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,517
Since it's a life where I'll never be happy,

274
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:15,874
I should just die.

275
00:20:15,994 --> 00:20:18,376
Who continues living for a reason?

276
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,347
Does anyone just sit there
silently if they have something to say?

277
00:20:23,365 --> 00:20:25,570
Why are you so irresponsible?

278
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,132
<i>Even for your parents,</i>

279
00:20:29,252 --> 00:20:31,858
where is the Joo Ah Ran
that would live on courageously?

280
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,771
Even if you crush the whole
world, it'll become yours,

281
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:38,075
where did that courage go?

282
00:20:39,596 --> 00:20:42,210
Dad and Mom will understand too.

283
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:44,924
If I go,

284
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,694
they should welcome me happily.

285
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:54,066
Don't hold onto me.

286
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,356
Why will you die?!

287
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,402
Without my permission,
you don't have the right to die.

288
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,684
You have to stay by
my side your entire life,

289
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:10,716
to repent for your sin of betrayal.

290
00:21:10,836 --> 00:21:12,349
What?

291
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:14,865
Isn't that better.

292
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,935
At least you didn't kill Hyun Woo Hyung,

293
00:21:19,055 --> 00:21:21,204
you're not a murderer,

294
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,594
I thought you would be happy.

295
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:26,544
Shin Hyun Woo is back!

296
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,555
Everything has returned to Shin Hyun Woo.

297
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:32,599
Shin Woo Sub has not lost anything either,
what good is that?

298
00:21:32,719 --> 00:21:35,567
I can only think about what I can get now.

299
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:39,553
Ah Ran, you're not Shin Hyun Woo's,

300
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,100
or Ahn Jae Sung's.

301
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,411
You'll stay by my side.

302
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:47,401
You're crazy.

303
00:21:48,927 --> 00:21:50,602
You're mentally ill.

304
00:21:54,153 --> 00:21:56,570
Why can't you let go of me?

305
00:21:57,397 --> 00:22:00,021
I'm a woman that ran off after loving me,
why can't you let me go?!

306
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,187
<i>Why?!</i>

307
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,650
Why?!

308
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,837
Why?!

309
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:05,385
Why?!

310
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:14,180
<i>One-sided love, could be my
destiny right from my birth.</i>

311
00:22:15,177 --> 00:22:19,078
<i>It's fine if you don't love me,
as long as you're by my side.</i>

312
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,131
<i>If even you leave me,</i>

313
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:25,037
<i>I might not be able to live in this world.</i>

314
00:22:43,688 --> 00:22:46,508
<i>Then, it was Nurse Yoon that saved Oppa.</i>

315
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:48,819
That Agasshi looks really intelligent,

316
00:22:48,939 --> 00:22:51,278
she has really become
the savior of our family.

317
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:53,678
It's because of all the fortune
Mom accumulated through her charity,

318
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:55,714
that I managed to get some help.

319
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,427
Without Jae Hee,

320
00:22:57,547 --> 00:23:00,459
I wouldn't have been able
to wake up from my vegetative state,

321
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:03,732
and dream about living like a human.

322
00:23:03,852 --> 00:23:05,450
What a strange world.

323
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,655
Mom supported Nurse Yoon
throughout university,

324
00:23:07,775 --> 00:23:10,602
and Nurse Yoon saved Hyung's life,

325
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,869
<i>which is why people
have to live with kindness.</i>

326
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:15,158
What a great piece of news after so long.

327
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:19,867
Then, what is with the company?
In name, it is all under Ahn Jae Sung.

328
00:23:19,987 --> 00:23:23,153
I've discussed it with the lawyer,
to change it to Shin Hyun Woo.

329
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:25,146
Then, Sister...

330
00:23:25,266 --> 00:23:27,139
Then, what about that woman Joo Ah Ran?

331
00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:29,691
Of course she has to be judged by the law.

332
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:35,097
She created two incidents that were
so horrific, and split our family apart.

333
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,857
No matter what she can't be forgiven.

334
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:39,382
Since you were going to use the law,
why did you wait so long?

335
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,714
When you first woke up, if you
had gone to the police straight away,

336
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,237
at least she wouldn't
have set the villa on fire.

337
00:23:44,357 --> 00:23:47,926
I wanted to take all the betrayal
I felt, and give it to her.

338
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,569
I also wanted to know, why Joo Ah Ran
wanted to do such things.

339
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,697
You won't be uncomfortable, right?

340
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:25,502
How about sharing a room
with Hyun Min first?

341
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:26,519
No.

342
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,230
I have a house that I looked for,
I'll just stay there.

343
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,307
You want to live apart from us?

344
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:33,601
Why?

345
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:36,964
We haven't seen each other for such a long time,
why do you want to live separately?

346
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:40,101
I will come often, don't worry.

347
00:24:43,091 --> 00:24:45,140
After going through such
a difficult surgery,

348
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,217
you must have suffered so much pain.

349
00:24:47,337 --> 00:24:50,440
How lonely you were, how tired,

350
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,768
Mom couldn't do anything either.

351
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:57,445
Why is Mom sorry?

352
00:24:57,565 --> 00:25:00,286
That's the payback I get
for loving the wrong person.

353
00:25:00,406 --> 00:25:01,728
That's right.

354
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:06,217
It was you who brought Jae Hee to the
orphanage. How did you know Jae Hee?

355
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:09,376
What do you mean know?

356
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:12,090
It was a coincidence that
a friend asked me for a favor.

357
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,707
I was just helping a friend.

358
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,509
Is that so?

359
00:25:16,996 --> 00:25:21,131
She said she was going to see her
Unnie, I don't know if she saw her.

360
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,593
Did you meet Ah Ran?

361
00:25:32,713 --> 00:25:35,910
Her dead husband actually came
back alive, how embarrassing.

362
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,161
What?

363
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,462
Who came back alive?

364
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:42,586
You don't know?

365
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:44,833
Ah Ran's husband came back alive.

366
00:25:44,953 --> 00:25:49,156
Our Manager's Hyung didn't die,
he just hid using someone else's name.

367
00:25:49,276 --> 00:25:51,976
Oh my, oh my,
what is this?

368
00:25:52,096 --> 00:25:56,004
Then, the fact that our Ah Ran is
marrying someone else is out?

369
00:25:56,124 --> 00:26:01,118
It's not that, the groom was that person,
that person was the groom.

370
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:04,044
What is this girl talking about?

371
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:06,694
Then, you're saying that
after she got married,

372
00:26:06,814 --> 00:26:10,486
two husbands appeared, and her being
chased out, is just a matter of time.

373
00:26:10,606 --> 00:26:12,818
Oh my, oh my,
I'm so frustrated.

374
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh my, I'm so frustrated.

375
00:26:27,442 --> 00:26:28,841
<i>It's locked.</i>

376
00:26:28,961 --> 00:26:32,161
Jae Hee, if you kiss it, it could open.

377
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:56,470
I would never love anyone again,
because my heart froze into a block of ice.

378
00:26:57,254 --> 00:27:01,071
But, you just opened my heart.

379
00:27:02,385 --> 00:27:03,445
Ahjusshi.

380
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,940
Do you... want to marry me?

381
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,350
<i>Kyeong Ran.</i>

382
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:10,869
<i>Unnie is really tired.</i>

383
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:16,557
<i>That man, was just the son of our enemy.</i>

384
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:20,734
<i>But, why is my heart being
torn apart because of that man?</i>

385
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,571
<i>Since we can't be in love,</i>

386
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:31,020
<i>we might as well, hate each other,
and step all over each other.</i>

387
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:43,631
The interrogation is going to begin.

388
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,886
July 13,

389
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:49,475
In Seoul, north Changwon,
in Hyun Woo's car,

390
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:53,120
was involved in a car
accident due to bad driving.

391
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,300
Who was driving?

392
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,840
Then, my wife, Joo Ah Ran was driving.

393
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,833
That was my husband's, Shin Hyun Woo's car.

394
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,530
When the incident happened, the person sitting
in the driver's seat, was also Shin Hyun Woo.

395
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:10,343
Now, I'm in front of you.
Are you going to lie?

396
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,972
I can take out the black box that
has been kept, as evidence.

397
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:17,326
Officer.

398
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:23,534
I'm prepared to accept
the punishments for my crimes.

399
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:27,583
But before that, I have a request.

400
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,513
A request?

401
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:31,139
A long time ago,

402
00:29:31,733 --> 00:29:34,383
in the furniture company
that Shin Woo Sub ran,

403
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:38,538
there was a couple who died
because of hidden reasons.

404
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,873
I hope you can investigate that incident.

405
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,121
What are you saying?

406
00:29:43,241 --> 00:29:45,135
Who killed who in that furniture company?

407
00:29:45,153 --> 00:29:47,637
Do you still not know, even now?

408
00:29:48,379 --> 00:29:50,096
Your father,

409
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,464
killed my parents,

410
00:29:52,483 --> 00:29:54,436
in front of my eyes.

411
00:29:55,772 --> 00:29:58,825
And he even cruelly,
crushed them under wood.

412
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:00,288
<i>Don't lie anymore.</i>

413
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,401
I won't be cheated by your
cheap tricks anymore.

414
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:03,800
It's true.

415
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,578
I know Ah Ran.

416
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:10,351
And it was also because my dad asked
me to take care of Ah Ran when he died.

417
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,282
Because of President,
she grew up as a lonely orphan.

418
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:19,374
If you don't believe me,
ask your Dad here and ask him.

419
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,406
Letting my poor parents die,

420
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:26,513
and my poor sister run away,
ask him here immediately!

421
00:30:27,552 --> 00:30:30,753
Why I had to live,
selling drinks and smiles,

422
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:33,905
was all because of your father.

423
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:39,375
What is all this in the
middle of our interrogation?

424
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:42,131
Shin Hyun Woo.

425
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:47,850
Now, is what Joo Ah Ran is saying, true?

426
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:49,779
No.

427
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,302
This is the first time I'm hearing this.

428
00:30:52,422 --> 00:30:55,494
How about meeting again
after you've found out the truth?

429
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:59,819
We were also thinking about looking
for a lawyer, to start a true investigation.

430
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,792
You're still alive.

431
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:10,121
But my parents are already dead.

432
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:16,365
Whose crime is bigger,
is clear without even comparing.

433
00:31:42,812 --> 00:31:44,907
Because of your family,
do you know how I lived?

434
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:47,239
My parents, and my sister!

435
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:51,076
Getting married, to my pathetic
life, is a strand of straw.

436
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:53,981
And a shame to my parents who died wrongly.

437
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:57,225
They worked hard their
entire life in a factory.

438
00:31:57,345 --> 00:32:01,082
But died wrongly because
of a truth they spoke.

439
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:05,788
It was a cover up, for the
murder that they suffered.

440
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:14,439
Even though we've let it out,

441
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,895
but the matter with Shin Woo Sub was
something that happened 20 years ago.

442
00:32:18,015 --> 00:32:20,492
It's also past the investigation period.

443
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:25,856
Even if they find the truth out now,
there can't be any punishment.

444
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,783
I know.

445
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:31,112
We came all this way because
the law can't serve us.

446
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,005
But, it can't be because time has passed,

447
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:40,203
that the crime of breaking
up a family is let go.

448
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,240
For a man like Shin Hyun Woo,

449
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,502
he won't be able to neglect his
father's crime and send me to jail.

450
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,382
Let's go, I'm tired.

451
00:32:59,195 --> 00:33:03,466
<i>That's right. We have to say that
Nurse Yoon is Ah Ran's sister.</i>

452
00:33:04,267 --> 00:33:06,557
<i>No matter how Hyun Woo
Hyung wants to take revenge,</i>

453
00:33:06,677 --> 00:33:10,453
<i>he can't leave the sister
of the woman he loves alone.</i>

454
00:33:10,877 --> 00:33:15,372
<i>For Nurse Yoon, he'll have
to destroy all the charges.</i>

455
00:33:19,753 --> 00:33:21,874
Nurse Yoon.

456
00:33:22,616 --> 00:33:25,287
You said you were looking for your Unnie.

457
00:33:25,647 --> 00:33:29,061
I'll let you meet her.

458
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:33,802
I know. I'll go when the time comes.

459
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:38,445
Was it Nam Joo Seung?

460
00:33:38,724 --> 00:33:41,781
How could Nam Joo Seung
know where your Unnie is?

461
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,622
But, it doesn't seem like he's lying.

462
00:33:44,742 --> 00:33:48,120
He told me to meet him at
6 at Seoul Hotel's coffee shop.

463
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:51,703
Nam Joo Seung has no
reason to find your Unnie.

464
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:56,246
All the crimes have been revealed,
there's nowhere to go.

465
00:33:56,366 --> 00:33:58,070
He might do something to you,
you have to be careful.

466
00:33:58,642 --> 00:34:01,101
It'll be fine if Ahjusshi comes along.

467
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:03,129
They're under police
investigation right now,

468
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,715
they wouldn't cause any trouble.

469
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,645
Hurry and go in.

470
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:15,636
Thank you. We were just about
to call you, it's good you came.

471
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:17,502
You haven't eaten yet, right?

472
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:21,422
It's not like we can repay what
you've done for us with a meal,

473
00:34:21,542 --> 00:34:23,479
but at least we can express our gratitude.

474
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,381
No, it's not like I've done anything.

475
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:31,321
Actually, you've sent me to school,
I've been the one who has been getting help.

476
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,525
Go wash your hands. On the way here,
didn't you keep saying you were hungry?

477
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:40,659
Sit.

478
00:34:42,006 --> 00:34:44,677
That's right, what happened
at the police station?

479
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:49,172
Don't feel like you should sympathize
with Joo Ah Ran, don't dream about it.

480
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:51,483
Other than that, Father,

481
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:55,840
when you were running Geum Ok Furniture,
were there any employees that died while working?

482
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:01,719
A couple that died on the same day,
did that death happen when Dad was in charge?

483
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,666
What? Who told you that?

484
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:07,384
Hurry and drag that person
over by his collar!

485
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:10,268
Please tell me,
I have to know.

486
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:12,364
Those are all things in the past.

487
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:15,629
They died because of a mistake they made,
why do you have to blame it on me?

488
00:35:15,749 --> 00:35:18,595
<i>Looks like they want to find
someone to take revenge on,</i>

489
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:21,055
do they think I'll blink because of that?

490
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,537
You remember it too, don't you?

491
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:24,190
That brother-in-law and his wife,
barged into the office,

492
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,992
and made a nuisance of themselves.

493
00:35:26,112 --> 00:35:27,604
<i>Do you not remember?</i>

494
00:35:27,724 --> 00:35:29,497
Yes, I remember.

495
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:31,850
Then, did you compensate them?

496
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,500
Is there any evidence of compensation?

497
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:37,426
<i>These are the secret accounts
for Geum Ok Furniture.</i>

498
00:35:37,546 --> 00:35:39,440
<i>Secretary Nam was in charge of it.</i>

499
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,933
<i>Not long ago, Joo Seung said it was part
of Secretary Nam's things, and brought it here.</i>

500
00:35:44,654 --> 00:35:48,852
Then, the company wasn't doing well,
so we couldn't give much compensation.

501
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:52,100
But giving that amount was already enough.

502
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,330
But,

503
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,556
did they really die because of an accident?

504
00:35:55,676 --> 00:35:57,825
I said it was so, why won't you believe me?

505
00:35:57,945 --> 00:35:58,779
But,

506
00:35:59,245 --> 00:36:01,332
who told you all of this?

507
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,915
Did that brother and his wife,
come look for you?

508
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:07,799
Actually,

509
00:36:08,308 --> 00:36:12,280
Joo Ah Ran, is the daughter
of the couple that died.

510
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,954
What?

511
00:36:14,074 --> 00:36:18,489
Joo Ah Ran is the daughter
of Factory Manager Joo Chul Min?

512
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:21,903
How can something like
that happen in this world?

513
00:36:22,023 --> 00:36:25,767
That means, she had bad intentions
when she married into our family?

514
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,693
She thought I killed her
father, or something?

515
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:33,207
No matter what methods Joo Ah Ran uses,
she'll use that incident to force my hand.

516
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,841
I can't handle the situation
without knowing the truth.

517
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:38,215
That factory manager was frustrating
me because of his bad behavior,

518
00:36:38,335 --> 00:36:41,289
it was true that his relationship
with me was bad.

519
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:44,532
But, am I the kind of person
that will kill a person so he'll shut up?

520
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:47,182
<i>Don't be influenced by her.</i>

521
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:49,684
<i>You have to get Joo Ah Ran to repent
for every single one of her crimes.</i>

522
00:36:51,274 --> 00:36:53,649
Yes, I believe Father.

523
00:36:54,418 --> 00:36:56,687
I'll take care of this account book.

524
00:36:57,959 --> 00:37:01,669
I heard Hyun Woo say you
we’re going to meet your sister.

525
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,450
Did you meet her?

526
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,061
I haven't met her yet,

527
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,093
there were too many things
going on yesterday.

528
00:37:08,213 --> 00:37:11,273
Maybe I'll meet her tonight.

529
00:37:11,393 --> 00:37:13,118
Ah, is that so?

530
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:16,105
Being able to meet my family,
is something that I never even dreamt about.

531
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:18,098
I'm especially excited and happy.

532
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:21,893
Tonight, I'm meeting Unnie,
Ahjusshi also promised to come with me.

533
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,837
Ah, sit.

534
00:37:27,469 --> 00:37:30,713
There's nothing much, just eat up.

535
00:37:31,073 --> 00:37:34,105
It looks delicious,
I'll eat well.

536
00:37:34,826 --> 00:37:38,730
Nurse Yoon looks like she
hasn't gotten married.

537
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,253
Is there a person you have in mind?

538
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,215
I was going to tell you after dinner,

539
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:51,374
but after the police investigations
and all the complications are settled,

540
00:37:51,494 --> 00:37:52,901
I was thinking of marrying Jae Hee.

541
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,445
<i>Marrying? It isn't anything bad too.</i>

542
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:59,450
<i>When you were in trouble, you spent it together,
looking at each other and relying on each other.</i>

543
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:03,309
Although it's a shame
you don't have parents,

544
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,832
as long as you're not the
daughter of Joo Chul Min.

545
00:38:05,952 --> 00:38:08,790
What do you think?
They're quite compatible, right?

546
00:38:09,193 --> 00:38:10,168
Yes?

547
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,373
Until now...

548
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,339
Ah, let me go.

549
00:38:24,459 --> 00:38:26,014
I said, I don't like it!

550
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:28,389
Why don't you like it?

551
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:32,474
I said I want to introduce you formally
to my family, does that make you so angry?

552
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:34,657
You said we were going somewhere else,
and asked me to dress up,

553
00:38:34,777 --> 00:38:36,438
so we're going to your house?

554
00:38:36,558 --> 00:38:39,152
When did I say I would marry you, Manager?

555
00:38:39,272 --> 00:38:41,717
Then, Yeon Jae, you don't like me?

556
00:38:41,837 --> 00:38:44,176
You haven't had any feelings
for me all this time?

557
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:47,462
Even though it's not the case,
but it's not marriage either.

558
00:38:47,582 --> 00:38:49,453
I don't want to be the daughter-in-law
of such a powerful family,

559
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:52,739
and then go around being bullied
like I have a needle stuck in my heart.

560
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,799
Is that the reason you don't want to?

561
00:38:56,435 --> 00:39:00,166
It looks like Hyung is telling them he
wants to marry Nurse Yoon today.

562
00:39:00,286 --> 00:39:03,219
Nurse Yoon and Yeon Jae
are not very different.

563
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:05,297
She grew up alone in an orphanage,

564
00:39:05,417 --> 00:39:06,931
and had a hard time going to school too.

565
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:08,776
Even so, she's a lady.

566
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,765
Your brother has been divorced before,
and now he's marrying a lady...

567
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:14,479
What conditions could he ask for?

568
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,505
Then, are we married,
or someone insignificant?

569
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:21,452
<i>What's the difference?</i>

570
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:25,311
I'm not a lady!

571
00:39:25,648 --> 00:39:27,705
Actually, he already died.

572
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,736
What... What?

573
00:39:30,856 --> 00:39:33,471
Although he died before
we could register it,

574
00:39:33,591 --> 00:39:35,443
but I've also had a wedding ceremony
where everybody came together,

575
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:37,664
I clearly had a husband.

576
00:39:37,784 --> 00:39:42,350
Although that idiot left a huge debt,
but, he was my husband for a day.

577
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,852
So, Manager, you wake up too.

578
00:39:52,118 --> 00:39:53,793
It... It can't be.

579
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,567
Yeon Jae... How could she...?

580
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:05,716
Hyun Woo, are you really,
going to marry Nurse Yoon?

581
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:07,031
Yes.

582
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:09,485
Once the divorce is settled,
I'm going to marry her.

583
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,202
That won't do.

584
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,577
You can't marry her, I don't agree.

585
00:40:13,697 --> 00:40:16,397
Why? Because she's an orphan?

586
00:40:16,736 --> 00:40:19,354
<i>Mom, you know too, what kind
of person Jae Hee is to me.</i>

587
00:40:19,672 --> 00:40:21,262
Without Jae Hee, I wouldn't
be the person I am today.

588
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:23,976
You can repay that gratitude
in a different way,

589
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:26,435
you don't have to get married
because you're thankful.

590
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:29,488
<i>If she needs money, help her with money.</i>

591
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:34,237
Mother, this sort of groundless
refusal doesn't seem like my mother at all.

592
00:40:34,357 --> 00:40:36,760
You have to at least give me a reason.

593
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,159
Hyun Woo,

594
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:43,426
although you loved Ah Ran,
you didn't know everything about Ah Ran.

595
00:40:43,546 --> 00:40:44,995
<i>Jae Hee is the same too.</i>

596
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,797
What parents gave birth to her,

597
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:49,151
what her past was like,
you don't have any idea.

598
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:51,370
Why, do you want to marry someone like that?

599
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,978
- Ah Ran and Jae Hee are different.
- There's no difference!

600
00:40:54,098 --> 00:40:55,222
Actually...

601
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,621
Actually... Jae Hee...

602
00:40:58,741 --> 00:40:59,829
<i>Hyung,</i>

603
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,851
what are you doing here?

604
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,699
Marry me.

605
00:41:41,971 --> 00:41:44,522
Don't touch my woman!

606
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:45,705
What?

607
00:41:46,304 --> 00:41:48,932
Yoon Jae Hee,
is the woman I love.

608
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:51,031
<i>Don't use your cruel hands,</i>

609
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:53,681
to touch a single hair of the woman I love.

610
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,063
No,

611
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:00,671
I can't give up.

612
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:04,514
Whether that man is Shin Hyun Woo,
or Ahn Jae Sung, I can't give up.

613
00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:09,729
He was clearly in front of me.

614
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,596
My heart is clearly still beating.

615
00:42:18,988 --> 00:42:22,041
It doesn't matter if I love him or hate him.

616
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:26,223
I can never give that man to Yoon Jae Hee.

617
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,060
Ah Ran came here, right?

618
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,459
Where is she?

619
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,366
Why would she come here?

620
00:43:01,486 --> 00:43:02,574
Did you forget?

621
00:43:02,694 --> 00:43:05,245
Our Hyun Woo came back alive.

622
00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:07,472
Is that so?

623
00:43:08,408 --> 00:43:10,931
Your tone makes you sound really grateful.

624
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:16,253
But, Hyun Woo coming back alive,
for Madam, you aren't just happy, right?

625
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:20,546
Hyun Woo, will continue
hanging out to Ah Ran.

626
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:25,168
Then, the only people that will be hurt,
will be your family, Madam.

627
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,421
Hyun Woo clings on to Ah Ran,
Ah Ran clings on to your family.

628
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,559
<i>What an interesting cycle.</i>

629
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:37,103
Oh right,

630
00:43:38,142 --> 00:43:43,805
I'll take this opportunity, maybe the secret
between Madam and I will be exposed.

631
00:43:43,925 --> 00:43:46,625
Why in the world are you doing this?

632
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:50,632
If you want to take revenge against me,
and linked hands with Ah Ran,

633
00:43:50,752 --> 00:43:52,458
please stop.

634
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:55,871
For Ah Ran, how much of
your life do you want to ruin?

635
00:43:55,991 --> 00:43:59,921
Your doctor's license has already been
suspended, how are you going to live?

636
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:03,404
Half a son is still a son,
are you worrying about me now?

637
00:44:04,103 --> 00:44:07,305
But, no matter what happens,

638
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:09,552
I won't abandon Ah Ran.

639
00:44:09,672 --> 00:44:15,306
I'll stand by... my father's
words to watch over Ah Ran.

640
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:17,627
Joo Seung.

641
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:21,910
Madam, you know too, right?

642
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:26,268
Ah Ran's sister, is Nurse Yoon.

643
00:44:27,774 --> 00:44:29,682
How did you know?

644
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:33,222
The person who handed Nurse Yoon
to the orphanage and kept supporting her...

645
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:36,179
was you, Madam, right?

646
00:44:36,624 --> 00:44:40,885
You wanted to redeem your crime
of killing Ah Ran's parents, right?

647
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,790
<i>But, by your hand,</i>

648
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,850
Hyun Woo and Nurse Yoon,
me and Ah Ran,

649
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:51,857
two brothers and two sisters,
have an inseparable relationship.

650
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,285
This life is interesting, right?

651
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:13,707
Hold on.

652
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,188
I have to talk to you,

653
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:27,613
about why I wanted to marry
you and created all this.

654
00:45:36,594 --> 00:45:40,453
You want to say that my
parents killed your parents,

655
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:42,827
<i>stop creating trouble.</i>

656
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:48,511
Your parents died because of an accident.

657
00:45:48,631 --> 00:45:53,705
Here is evidence that your uncle signed,
and we also paid you compensation.

658
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:56,854
How can you believe that account book?

659
00:45:58,063 --> 00:46:00,416
Have you thought that it
could have been faked?

660
00:46:00,536 --> 00:46:02,833
Stop trying those cheap threats!

661
00:46:03,914 --> 00:46:05,974
It looks like you want
to use those baseless excuses,

662
00:46:06,094 --> 00:46:08,645
to get yourself off.

663
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,126
I'll never let you off that easily.

664
00:46:20,055 --> 00:46:21,791
Jae Hee, it's me.

665
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,081
<i>I'll be late.</i>

666
00:46:24,687 --> 00:46:26,646
You go to the wedding dress shop first.

667
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:28,360
I'll be there.

668
00:46:30,671 --> 00:46:32,219
Wedding shop?

669
00:46:34,954 --> 00:46:41,118
You've made me so pathetic,
and you want to marry Yoon Jae Hee?

670
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:48,861
Then, the ring, necklace, and the earrings
you gave me, what are these?

671
00:46:48,981 --> 00:46:51,957
Was it all efforts to trick me?!

672
00:46:55,298 --> 00:46:56,951
All right.

673
00:46:59,305 --> 00:47:01,085
You and I,

674
00:47:02,082 --> 00:47:06,603
will die here today.

675
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,882
Stop the car immediately!

676
00:47:14,002 --> 00:47:15,366
I'm not stopping!

677
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:17,392
Even if you can't be with me forever,

678
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:20,116
I can't watch you go back
to Yoon Jae Hee's side.

679
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:21,154
All right.

680
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:26,007
I won't die in your hands,
much less die with you!

681
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:44,521
Jae Sung.

682
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:46,874
Look at me.

683
00:47:49,058 --> 00:47:52,535
Besides your parents,
and my parents,

684
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:55,657
let the two of us talk.

685
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:57,862
Wake up.

686
00:47:57,982 --> 00:48:00,449
I'm not Ahn Jae Sung,
I'm Shin Hyun Woo.

687
00:48:00,569 --> 00:48:02,418
Did you forget?

688
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:08,143
My heart still remembers Ahn Jae Sung,
what do you want me to do?

689
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:14,197
Please take away the memories
of Ahn Jae Sung in my heart too, please.

690
00:48:18,744 --> 00:48:21,522
Such a woman like you is really disgusting.

691
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,041
You just explained that it was because
of your parents that you sought revenge.

692
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:28,078
Now, you're saying it's for love?

693
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,901
But what can I do?

694
00:48:30,021 --> 00:48:33,299
I didn't want to spend a single
cent of my money buying your love.

695
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:36,204
If you want love so much,

696
00:48:36,324 --> 00:48:38,896
how about going back to being Rosemary?

697
00:48:54,237 --> 00:48:55,361
Ahn Jae Sung.

698
00:48:57,354 --> 00:48:59,686
You underestimate me.

699
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,333
I won't die that easily.

700
00:49:23,982 --> 00:49:25,014
Are you Yoon Jae Hee?

701
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:25,743
Yes.

702
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:28,252
President Ahn Jae Sun
asked me to pick you up.

703
00:49:28,372 --> 00:49:29,986
Ahjusshi?

704
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:31,767
He asked me to wait here.

705
00:49:31,887 --> 00:49:34,806
He said he would take a long time.

706
00:49:35,399 --> 00:49:36,799
Please get in the car.

707
00:49:50,216 --> 00:49:51,361
Who are you?

708
00:49:59,161 --> 00:50:00,051
Where's my guest?

709
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:01,748
<i>She's not here yet.</i>

710
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:03,995
What? Not here yet?

711
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,296
The time has already passed.

712
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:13,805
<i>Your call cannot be connected right now...</i>

713
00:50:17,863 --> 00:50:19,305
Jae Hee.

714
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:28,894
Jae Hee, where are you?

715
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,989
Nothing happened, right?
Everything is fine, right?

716
00:50:34,279 --> 00:50:37,823
<i>Tonight, at 6, he asked me to go
to Seoul Hotel's Coffee shop.</i>

717
00:50:50,918 --> 00:50:53,086
Where did you go?

718
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:56,691
In the future, no matter
what you do, tell me.

719
00:50:58,766 --> 00:51:00,568
Joo Seung.

720
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:03,948
Do you still have anything you need me for?

721
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:09,274
You clearly know that being
with me will be dangerous for you.

722
00:51:09,677 --> 00:51:10,971
Why aren't you leaving?

723
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:13,493
I still have things to do for you.

724
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:19,015
I contacted Kyeong Ran.

725
00:51:19,524 --> 00:51:23,637
We made an appointment to meet
at Seoul Hotel's coffee shop at 6.

726
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:26,904
Is that true?

727
00:51:27,024 --> 00:51:28,897
How do you know Kyeong Ran?

728
00:51:29,017 --> 00:51:31,080
How I know her, you'll
understand when we meet.

729
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,900
Hurry and get ready. It's almost time.

730
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:02,711
<i>Ah Ran. Don't hate me.</i>

731
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,700
<i>This is the best choice I can make for you.</i>

732
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,075
<i>If you don't hurry and capture Yoon Jae Hee,</i>

733
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,564
<i>you won't escape the palm of Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

734
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:47,357
What are you doing here?

735
00:52:47,477 --> 00:52:49,392
Where's Jae Hee?

736
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,598
What have you done to Jae Hee?

737
00:52:52,895 --> 00:52:55,206
From the afternoon,
Jae Hee has been missing.

738
00:52:55,326 --> 00:52:57,687
Nurse Yoon is missing?

739
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:05,498
She's not at home, she's not picking up her
phone, her person has gone missing.

740
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,805
If the two of you have messed with Jae Hee,

741
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:12,421
I'll risk my life, and
not let the two of you go.

742
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:22,198
Those leather shoes,
whose are those?

743
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,237
It has nothing to do with you.

744
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,999
I've made an appointment
with someone really important.

745
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,271
Please don't pretend you're interested,
and leave.

746
00:53:35,391 --> 00:53:36,667
<i>No.</i>

747
00:53:37,706 --> 00:53:40,080
This has something to do with Hyung.

748
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:42,675
Take a seat.

749
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:46,025
Since you're here, I want to
tell you about Ah Ran's sister.

750
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:48,866
What does that mean?

751
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:51,600
Why do we have to tell him about Kyeong Ran?

752
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,618
Kyeong Ran?

753
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:56,731
My real name isn't Jae Hee, it's Kyeong Ran.

754
00:53:57,515 --> 00:53:59,911
- Kyeong Ran?
- That's right, Kyeong Ran.

755
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:03,690
Hyung, you know her too.

756
00:54:05,174 --> 00:54:07,930
How does he know our Kyeong Ran?

757
00:54:10,944 --> 00:54:12,399
Because Kyeong Ran...

758
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:14,935
is Nurse Yoon.

759
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:21,089
What?

760
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:23,951
Nurse Yoon's real name is Joo Kyeong Ran.

761
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:27,873
<i>When your parents died,</i>

762
00:54:27,993 --> 00:54:31,845
Madam handed Kyeong Ran
over to Angel Orphanage.

763
00:54:33,768 --> 00:54:35,831
That can't be.

764
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:41,059
Yoon Jae Hee is Kyeong Ran.

765
00:54:42,628 --> 00:54:44,578
Our Kyeong Ran...

766
00:54:45,299 --> 00:54:47,674
how could she be Yoon Jae Hee?

767
00:55:00,678 --> 00:55:02,395
Jae Hee...

768
00:55:03,816 --> 00:55:05,809
is Joo Ah Ran's sister.

769
00:55:07,081 --> 00:55:09,053
That can't be.

770
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:44,324
Open the door!

771
00:55:45,278 --> 00:55:47,695
Please open the door!

772
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,069
<i>Someone!</i>

773
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,785
When did you know?

774
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,919
Why didn't you tell me, why?

775
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:03,464
I only found out not long ago.

776
00:56:04,022 --> 00:56:06,566
I was afraid you would be affected,
so I didn't tell you.

777
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:09,874
Why does it have to be Yoon Jae Hee?

778
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:13,605
The sister I was looking so desperately for,

779
00:56:13,901 --> 00:56:16,085
why did it have to be Yoon Jae Hee?

780
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:19,286
<i>How does it feel?</i>

781
00:56:19,965 --> 00:56:24,502
Hyung, the woman you hate the most and
the woman you love the most are actually sisters.

782
00:56:25,073 --> 00:56:26,748
<i>Their blood is connected.</i>

783
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:28,656
Sisters who have met only after 25 years,

784
00:56:28,674 --> 00:56:30,458
are they going to go against
that because of you, Hyung?

785
00:56:30,578 --> 00:56:32,579
No, it can't be!

786
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:35,356
Jae Hee can't be sisters with Joo Ah Ran!

787
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:38,108
If you don't believe me, go
ask Madam personally.

788
00:56:38,469 --> 00:56:40,461
Madam knows everything.

789
00:56:41,628 --> 00:56:43,090
What?

790
00:56:44,362 --> 00:56:45,889
It's all a lie.

791
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:48,140
I don't believe it.

792
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:50,642
I can't not recognize my sister.

793
00:56:51,236 --> 00:56:53,547
Something must have gone wrong.

794
00:56:53,667 --> 00:56:56,112
Yoon Jae Hee is not my sister!

795
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,665
Nurse Yoon...

796
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:46,456
is our Kyeong Ran?

797
00:57:48,115 --> 00:57:50,617
She's my sister?

798
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:24,031
That's really strange.

799
00:58:24,689 --> 00:58:27,127
Sisters born by the same parents.

800
00:58:27,247 --> 00:58:33,532
One wants to give someone love,
one wants to give someone hate.

801
00:58:35,886 --> 00:58:43,339
Nurse Yoon, even if she's Joo Ah Ran's
sister, you haven't been moved, right?

802
00:58:47,303 --> 00:58:49,360
I don't know either.

803
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,201
Why is everything so complicated?

804
00:58:54,759 --> 00:58:58,109
Because of me, what if
something happens to her?

805
00:58:58,745 --> 00:59:01,188
My heart is so restless
it's about to explode.

806
00:59:01,308 --> 00:59:05,302
I can't let Jae Hee get
hurt because of my revenge.

807
00:59:07,379 --> 00:59:09,245
Don't worry too much.

808
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:12,469
It'll definitely be all right.

809
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:25,274
When you can't do anything,
just don't do anything.

810
00:59:27,246 --> 00:59:33,133
We can only wait for time to pass,
and let the storm settle.

811
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:40,405
Love is really difficult.

812
01:00:11,749 --> 01:00:15,514
You really don't know where Nurse Yoon is?

813
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:20,135
I don't know.

814
01:00:23,498 --> 01:00:26,339
What are your plans for the future?

815
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:29,371
Even if I'm Yoon Jae Hee's sister,
what difference does it make?

816
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:33,185
I'm still Joo Ah Ran.

817
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,383
<i>What a really cheap and unsalvageable woman.</i>

818
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:51,300
<i>I've always especially despised you,
but I think you're pathetic today.</i>

819
01:00:51,788 --> 01:00:56,367
<i>In order to live such a terrible life, your mother
suffered so much pain to give birth to you?</i>

820
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:57,964
<i>How pathetic.</i>

821
01:00:59,215 --> 01:01:00,657
Mom.

822
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:02,713
Dad.

823
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,867
What should I do?

824
01:01:10,026 --> 01:01:11,828
Tell me.

825
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:17,690
I shouldn't have looked for Kyeong Ran.

826
01:01:19,513 --> 01:01:22,291
I should have just thought she was dead.

827
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:25,908
Then, I wouldn't be in so much pain now.

828
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:28,529
Jae Hee is Joo Ah Ran's sister,

829
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:30,649
is this true?

830
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,956
How do you know?

831
01:02:34,076 --> 01:02:35,885
So it's true.

832
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:38,747
Till the end, I hoped it wouldn't be true.

833
01:02:38,867 --> 01:02:41,376
That's why I objected to your marriage.

834
01:02:41,496 --> 01:02:43,538
Does Jae Hee know too?

835
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:46,130
She still doesn't know.

836
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:49,289
From yesterday afternoon,
she's been missing.

837
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:52,151
Missing? What does that mean?

838
01:02:52,787 --> 01:02:55,735
No matter what, I think Ah Ran
has done something to Jae Hee.

839
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:57,495
I have a bad feeling.

840
01:02:57,615 --> 01:03:01,353
If nothing happened, she wouldn't
be uncontactable like this.

841
01:03:02,944 --> 01:03:04,894
My guess was too shallow.

842
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:06,919
I shouldn't have helped that child.

843
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:11,223
<i>If I hadn't helped that child,
you wouldn't have met like that,</i>

844
01:03:11,343 --> 01:03:15,675
and Ah Ran and Jae Hee, wouldn't
meet under these consequences.

845
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:20,074
Even if it wasn't for Mother, people who
were meant to meet, will still meet.

846
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:24,166
Jae Hee is Ah Ran's sister,
but my heart won't change either.

847
01:03:24,286 --> 01:03:26,095
I want to marry Jae Hee.

848
01:03:26,215 --> 01:03:27,834
That won't do.

849
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:31,517
Ah Ran is your wife,
your legally married wife.

850
01:03:31,637 --> 01:03:33,743
But, how could you marry Ah Ran's sister?

851
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:35,460
That's incest.

852
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,190
Even so, I have to take
responsibility for Jae Hee.

853
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:42,073
No matter what, I can't let her get hurt.

854
01:03:42,387 --> 01:03:45,143
If something happens to her because of me,

855
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:47,400
I'll never forgive myself.

856
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,516
Hyun Woo.

857
01:03:51,343 --> 01:03:53,951
Even though I'm sorry to say this,

858
01:03:54,269 --> 01:03:58,197
can you not press charges against Joo Seung?

859
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:00,487
No matter what, to you,

860
01:04:00,607 --> 01:04:03,498
he was a child that was
like a younger brother.

861
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:06,784
This time,

862
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:09,907
there are burdens that
he has to bear as well.

863
01:04:10,027 --> 01:04:14,126
Mom should harden her heart,
and just watch.

864
01:04:24,914 --> 01:04:26,356
Shin Hyun Woo.

865
01:04:27,796 --> 01:04:29,259
Do we have to go all the way?

866
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:31,549
This cannot continue.

867
01:04:31,669 --> 01:04:33,521
No matter what card Shin Hyun Woo plays,

868
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,150
we have to make preparations.

869
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:39,362
<i>There's a lawyer we know, you go meet him.</i>

870
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:42,287
I have to go around and
make preparations too.

871
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:48,966
She's all right, right?

872
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:51,117
Don't do anything to her, just monitor her.

873
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:52,813
I'm leaving right now.

874
01:05:02,408 --> 01:05:05,291
All right, Joo Ah Ran,
you make your move.

875
01:05:05,673 --> 01:05:07,962
Now that you know that
Jae Hee is your sister,

876
01:05:08,082 --> 01:05:10,867
you can't be completely unmoved either.

877
01:05:20,634 --> 01:05:21,609
All right.

878
01:05:22,203 --> 01:05:24,768
Since this is the case,
I have no choice either.

879
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,736
I can only tell the truth now.

880
01:05:34,005 --> 01:05:37,015
This is Maria Nunnery, right?

881
01:06:23,439 --> 01:06:24,563
No!

882
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:26,993
Come down. No.

883
01:06:29,304 --> 01:06:33,035
So it was you,
who shut me here.

884
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:38,406
Not only are you not repenting,
are you going to continue doing evil?

885
01:06:38,936 --> 01:06:41,543
<i>I won't be controlled by you anymore,</i>

886
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:43,133
rather than that,

887
01:06:43,253 --> 01:06:47,829
I might as well jump down
from here and break both my legs.

888
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,727
No! It's dangerous!

889
01:07:04,136 --> 01:07:05,302
Jae Hee!

890
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,231
No, don't move.

891
01:07:07,351 --> 01:07:08,418
Ahjussi.

892
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:11,959
<i>No! Kyeong Ran!</i>

893
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:18,958
No.

894
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:23,973
I promised Mom.

895
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,048
I would take care of you.

896
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:51,328
No.

897
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:57,249
It can't be.

898
01:07:57,369 --> 01:07:59,136
It can't be!

899
01:08:07,176 --> 01:08:07,939
Jae Hee!

900
01:08:08,059 --> 01:08:09,720
No! Kyeong Ran!

906
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:22,230
<i>Joo Ah Ran is really my sister?</i>

907
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:23,523
She isn't right?

908
01:08:23,643 --> 01:08:26,373
<i>How can such a frightening
person be my Unnie?</i>

909
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:27,857
We're not sisters anymore.

910
01:08:27,977 --> 01:08:30,910
<i>There's only Shin Hyun Woo's
woman, Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

911
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,946
Joo Ah Ran is Joo Ah Ran,
Yoon Jae Hee is Yoon Jae Hee.

912
01:08:33,066 --> 01:08:34,430
<i>I'm going to kill them all.</i>

913
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:35,451
<i>The President...</i>

914
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:37,402
<i>Your Mother and Hyun Woo.</i>

915
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:38,992
<i>You found the real Ahn Jae Sung?</i>

916
01:08:39,112 --> 01:08:41,914
If only the real Ahn Jae Sung is alive, every
contract that Shin Hyun Woo made would be a fraud.

917
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:44,903
<i>The person who spoilt the wheel,
was you, Shin Woo Sub, right?</i>

918
01:08:45,023 --> 01:08:46,837
<i>You left out an important detail.</i>

919
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:48,703
<i>My dad has two daughters,</i>

920
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:51,353
the elder daughter is me, the
younger daughter is Yoon Jae Hee,

921
01:08:51,473 --> 01:08:53,601
Father's prospective daughter-in-law.

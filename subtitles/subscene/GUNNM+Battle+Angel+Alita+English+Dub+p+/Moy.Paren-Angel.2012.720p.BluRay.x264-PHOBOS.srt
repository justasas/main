Young man!

00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,388
You have snow on your head.

23
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,559
A foreigner!

24
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,646
You all just walk hatless...

25
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:52,107

Sasha, Happy coming New Year!

35
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,724
Oh, it's you, dad?

36
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,143
What time is it?

37
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,395
5 p.m.

38
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
What?

39
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,025
It's 5 p.m. in Kamchatka.

40
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,734
Daught!

41
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:04,371
I'll be passing through Moscow today. Any chance
you could shelter two homeless volcanologists?

42
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,494
Dad, I was actually going to see some
friends.

43
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:11,204
Who's the second one?

44
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,499
My colleague, Seryoga.

45
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,501
He's a great guy.

46
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,171
He's an Alpinist,
he can even roast potatoes.

47
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,965
All in all, you're gonna like him!

48
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,593
Dad, I already have a boyfriend...

49
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,389
...with such a pretty whiskered snout!

50
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,183
If whiskers count for you,
he could grow his own!

51
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:32,642
What?

52
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:33,560
Who?

53
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,481
- I said 'no problem, he can grow his whiskers'.
- Dad, I was talking about my cat!

54
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,023
Dad!

55
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:58,835
Jeeze!

56
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,473
Happy coming New Year!

57
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,768
Hi, Valer! Dad will be coming to see me for
this New Year.

58
00:07:15,436 --> 00:07:19,273
Wait, your dad? But we were planning to go
to Rodion's place, no?

59
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,526
Then we'll have to celebrate it with my dad
first and then go to Rodion.

60
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,947
Is there any way we could do without your
dad?

61
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,157
Who's that?

62
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
What?

63
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,383
Well, somebody just walked by. Who is it?

64
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:39,751
It's my cousin from Chelyabinsk.

65
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,546
Why did she have her panties on?

66
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,740
You mean she wasn't supposed to have
anything on her at all?

67
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,343
Babe! Whom are you talking to?

68
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,220
Go fuck yourself!

69
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:51,597
Babe!

70
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,726
In Chelyabinsk!

71
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,265
Toe loop.

72
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:37,975
Are you OK?

73
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:42,648
How can I be OK? It's been snowing for a
week!

74
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:44,858
And I'm sick of cleaning it.

75
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:46,610
Does it hurt?

76
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,073
Yes, it hurts.

77
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,700
How about now?

78
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,537
It no longer hurts.

79
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,756
Hi! How about celebrating this New Year
with me?

80
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,052
What? You broke up with Valeric and
decided to give me a call?

81
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,993
Well yes, sure, I've been sitting here,
waiting for your call.

82
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,542
Never mind, if you don't want it.

83
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,810
I just wanted you to meet my dad.

84
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,104
Your dad? Meet your dad?

85
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,108
Do you just want to use me? So that I help
you with your exam?

86
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,526
You're sick?

87
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,152
Take a pill, will you?

88
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,905
No, I'm OK, and you are not gonna be OK,
today!

89
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,199
Know why? Volintsev will be taking the
exam!

90
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,325
No!

91
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,328
And we both know he hates geologist girls,
don't we?

92
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,956
Oh, you little toad!

93
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:42,415
Who? Me?

94
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,919
Now I see your true face, Nikolaeva!

95
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,215
It's the face of a person who doesn't
regard other people's feelings...

96
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,758
Come here!

97
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,724
Fuck!

98
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,029
...the sense of your uniqueness is a
profound illusion!

99
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:18,285
Seven billion people live on the Earth, and women make three
and a half billion. Five million of them are beautiful!

100
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,037
Come here, come on!!

101
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,207
Dangerous job, homie!

102
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,961
People throw bottles, eggs...

103
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,796
I said come here.

104
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,550
...you think you can lure a man with your
finger...

105
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,405
Why you kill good man?

106
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,668
Every week a Muscovite falling from the
roof...

107
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,504
...full of oneself, don't want to live?

108
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:11,755
Easy!

109
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,256
- Homie!
- Ambulance is on its' way.

110
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,633
Homie dead!

111
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,927
Such a nice guy!

112
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,095
It was an accident!

113
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,807
They still punish fiercely for an accident.

114
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,767
I know, I know everything. Come on!

115
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,646
Hey, look. He's alive.

116
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,902
Why you scare people?

117
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,780
We thought you lay yourself out. You alive.

118
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,577
Ok Vitya, grab your things. Hello!

119
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:42,994
Ok Vitya, grab your things. Hello!

120
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,123
So, who has fallen out of the window?

121
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:46,832
Me.

122
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,834
What do you mean? And this guy flew down
with you?

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, he...

124
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,504
I fell on him...

125
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,296
Ok, check him.

126
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,384
- And hold his head.
- Don't move!

127
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:58,884
Does it hurt?

128
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,804
I feel great!

129
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,306
I see. It's a torpid phase of shock.

130
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,684
Get the stretchers here!

131
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:09,438
...she fell from the roof. He push me,
and lay oneself out!

132
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,064
Hero of Russia!

133
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:14,151
Shut up, OK? I'm telling you it was an
accident!

134
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,445
Ok, sister. Please get in the car!

135
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,904
No, I can't.

136
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:18,780
What do you mean you can't?

137
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,947
I have an exam!

138
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:20,866
What?

139
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,116
I have an exam!

140
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,202
You don't need to worry, really.

141
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,621
We both feel great.

142
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,001
Some fucking comedians! Do you think we
don't have any other calls?

143
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,336
So who's gonna pay for this false call?

144
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:34,921
Come on. Let's chip in.

145
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,382
Everything hurts. Everything broken inside.

146
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,009
I need take to hospital!

147
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,969
Get in the car.

148
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,138
We'll take you to the hospital.

149
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,140
Vitya, let's take this one at least.

150
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,558
Happy coming New Year.

151
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,976
If you make it, that is.

152
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,937
Vitya, let's go!

153
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:03,867
Look at her. Exam my ass!

154
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,994
Just talking big!

155
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,662
We should've called cops!

156
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,871
Fuck!

157
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,085
It turns out I can fly.

158
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,174
My name's Sasha.

159
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,050
My name is Seraphim.

160
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,676
What?

161
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,138
Seraphim. It means 'red-hot'.

162
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,474
Yeah, I could use some of it to warm up.

163
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,018
Gotta go!

164
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,313
Sorry for that!

165
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,857
Happy coming New Year!

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Hey, red-hot!

167
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,328
Your coat is dirty!

168
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,335
And what should we do with it?

169
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:07,888
Damn!

170
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,306
The key's inside!!

171
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,318
I didn't even lock my door yesterday?

172
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:23,737
Stupid!

173
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:25,906
Come on in!

174
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,501
...you can remain silent, you can keep ignoring me,
you can't ignore the entire world...

175
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,296
...but one day you'll have to pay for that!

176
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,465
All because of you!

177
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:57,409
Why are you just standing there? Take your
clothes off, come on in!

178
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,034
Shall I take off my shirt as well?

179
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,535
What?

180
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,334
Sorry, I guess I got you wrong.

181
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,044
Quite wrong.

182
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:21,629
Here!

183
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,006
Put the kettle on.

184
00:15:23,882 --> 00:15:24,882
And feed the cat.

185
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:26,455
The food is in the refrigerator!

186
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,187
This is not happening.

187
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,034
Why did you give him my chicken?

188
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,161
Cats love chicken.

189
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:54,829
Really?

190
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,206
I love it too!

191
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Fuck!

192
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,866
Why didn't you put the kettle on?

193
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,175
I did.

194
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,178
Fuck!

195
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,390
It seems I've really knocked you off. Maybe
you should go to the hospital?

196
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,976
No, I feel perfectly healthy.

197
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,351
You sure?

198
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,235
This is how you put it.

199
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,610
Remember.

200
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,533
I'll change my clothes, and you dry the
coat, it's in the bathroom.

201
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,160
The bathroom's here.

202
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,798
Hot air!

203
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,383
Very hot!

204
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,135
Where are you from?

205
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,845
From Jerusalem.

206
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,718
I guess you don't have any hair-dryers
there, do you?

207
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:57,016
No.

208
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,478
Then how do you dry your head?

209
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,814
Head?

210
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,485
I'm sorry,
but why do I need to dry my head?

211
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,404
Yeah, right.

212
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,450
Want some tea?

213
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:16,578
Green, black? Tea!

214
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,413
Coffee?

215
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:34,012
Tea.

216
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,345
Tea.

217
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,058
This tea grew on the slope of Sichuan
mountain...

218
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,894
...a Chinese girl by
name Xu Lin gathered it

219
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,648
...she loved a man by name Chu Young,

220
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,860
but married Li Zhen who works in a L.E.D.
factory.

221
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,697
And Chu Young hasn't married yet...

222
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,161
Creamy Candy - fudge with candied fruit!

223
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,705
Made by Red October factory!

224
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:08,630
Sweetened condensed milk, butter, syrup,
candied fruit, alcohol, brandy...

225
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,049
Aromatics, 411 calories!

226
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,389
Packer number 5.

227
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,643
Dyed blonde,

228
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:26,773
a single mother of forty-five.

229
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,821
Sorry, but she's 32 and her hair are red.
Two kids...

230
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,781
twins. Katya and Angela.

231
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,534
Sometimes she takes candies home.

232
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,412
If she doesn't stop, she'll be fired soon.

233
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:45,875
It's very sad.

234
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:47,627
Who are you anyway?

235
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,339
I mean what do you do to make a living?

236
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,508
I help people.

237
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,429
Some kind of a charitable organization?

238
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,640
You could say that.

239
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,742
So what's the name of the organization?

240
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,437
The heavenly host.

241
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,320
So you're a sectarian or something?

242
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,285
I'm an angel.

243
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:23,412
I see.

244
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:24,997
Me too.

245
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,667
Sometimes!

246
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,753
I'm sorry but you're human.

247
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,381
Feminine.

248
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,428
Look, host. I've gotta go, really, sorry.

249
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,763
Crystallography is a complex science.

250
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
How did you find out?

251
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,190
That was funny...

252
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,138
For instance, let's take an ordinary
snowflake.

253
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:23,932
It's a real crystal, formed by the collision of
droplets of water with field particles in the clouds!

254
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,354
Look at this beautiful shape!

255
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,430
By the way, have you read the treatise of
Johannes Kepler on hexagonal snowflakes?

256
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,614
In this treatise, the author
reflects on the form of snowflakes.

257
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,116
What are you doing there?

258
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,578
Catching a cab!

259
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,831
- With your hand?
- And with what else?

260
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,556
Fuck!

261
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,863
What are you doing? Let the car go, you
freak!

262
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,026
I said let it go,
or I'm gonna call the police.

263
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,548
I'm sorry, but why did you stop?

264
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,550
You won't believe.

265
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,884
I'm going crazy.

266
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,721
I feel uncomfortable
driving with the blinker.

267
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:50,268
It was OK before, but today it feels
uncomfortable.

268
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,106
So I began to persuade myself,
saying 'don't fret, man'.

269
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,819
It's an official car after all,
still I feel uncomfortable.

270
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,989
And I saw a girl running, in a hurry.

271
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,576
And I say to myself 'let's do something
good'.

272
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,540
I'm sorry, do you happen to be from
Jerusalem?

273
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:15,709
Do I look like?

274
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,424
No, just asking.

275
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:56,459
Well then, Johannes Kepler wondered why
the snowflake is strictly of a hexagonal
shape.

276
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,883
One of us definitely pitched on one's head.

277
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:09,972
Why? Because when the microscopic water
droplets in the clouds face with the field
particles and freeze...

278
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,141
...the six-pointed crystal
forms come about.

279
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,228
All right, look, snow-lover!
Do you have any gum?

280
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,772
A gum, you know.

281
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:24,654
Thanks.

282
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:30,326
Because of the structure of water
molecules, only 60 " and 120 " angles are
possible between the rays of the crystal!

283
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,206
What's that?

284
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:39,335
It's the very first gum. 1848.

285
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,964
Made by the factory of John Curtis. Called
"Licorice Lulu."

286
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,468
- What fucking Lulu?
- Sasha!

287
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,638
Happy coming New Year!

288
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:53,599
Who's this guy?

289
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,477
Seraphim! It's a pleasure to meet you!

290
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:59,188
My name's Vardar. The pleasure seems to
be mutual!

291
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,397
Shall we?

292
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,025
- He's a psycho, you stupid!
- A psycho?

293
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,360
He's so cute?

294
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,242
Hi!

295
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:20,326
My ugly cat gets on the ledge. Hi! I try to reach him, and then I slip,
and I fly down like a bullet! From the third floor!

296
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,518
That's horrible! Your whole life probably
flashed before your eyes?

297
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:27,508
What? What life? I'm falling down and
yelling 'Maaaaaa'!! And this guy was
standing beneath!

298
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,804
I'm falling down and yelling 'Maaaaaa'! And
this guy was standing beneath!

299
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,733
Do they take your exam here?

300
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,486
Well, in a way yes. But you'll need to take
the other door!

301
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,720
I'm sorry. What kind of exam is this?

302
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,201
Let me explain you that!

303
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,710
The man actually saved your life! And you
just call him a psycho.

304
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,840
Ok, he's not a psycho, but I don't know.
Somewhat inadequate, I told him to put the
kettle on, and he just put it on the table.

305
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,969
He hadn't seen a hair-dryer before, for
Christ's sake.

306
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:55,824
It's called 'Male consumer idiocy' which is
pretty much normal!

307
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:58,558
He stopped a car by holding
its' bumper with one hand.

308
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,311
I saw on TV a man pulling a train with his
teeth!

309
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,984
It took me 15 minutes to get here by a car
with a blinker on. And he just happened to
be here already!

310
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:12,363
Means he had another car with a blinker
around the corner which explains
everything. Maybe he works for the Federal
Security Service.

311
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,199
He's from Jerusalem.

312
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:16,867
Then it's some Israeli CIA.

313
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,538
He says he's an angel.

314
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:24,292
Angel?
So what is it you don't like in that?

315
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:25,957
Did you do the cheatsheet?

316
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,627
Have a look.

317
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:32,842
Here we have the crystal lattice, this is the
unit cell, and here is the polymorphism.

318
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:40,266
Are you kidding me? Is this the stone age?
It's a polycrapism, not polymorphism.

319
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
Know what!

320
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:46,939
It took me half the night to prepare them.
The order of the rector. Anybody who gets
caught with a mobile phone, will be out.

321
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,318
On cheatsheets there's nothing said in the
order.

322
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,614
Ok, Bandar-logs, everybody come down
here!

323
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,401
I'm not going to sit here
with you until the New Year!

324
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,412
Get your mark books ready.

325
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,833
Put your mobile phones on the table!

326
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,590
Why did you come? You're automatically
passed!

327
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,634
Let me have your mark book!

328
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,887
Come on, come on!

329
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,098
- Don't drink too much.
- I don't drink at all.

330
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:23,601
And I don't smoke.

331
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,482
- Happy coming New Year!
- Thanks!

332
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,864
Ok, whoever answers first, gets one extra
point!

333
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,331
Varv!

334
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,002
Varv, the formation of snow.

335
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,379
Right away.

336
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,137
- Lower, lower...
- Can't.

337
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,015
You!

338
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:06,686
What is it you're looking for in there?

339
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,144
Nothing!

340
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,510
No, you were looking for something, I saw.
Need any help?

341
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,401
No! Thanks! I'll be answering!

342
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:15,443
Your name?

343
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:16,486
Nikolaeva!

344
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,705
The law of crystal symmetry. The formation
of snow!

345
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:38,467
Back in the sixteenth century, the medieval
scholar, Johannes Kepler wondered why the
snowflake is strictly of a hexagonal shape!

346
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:41,679
You've been reading Kepler?

347
00:28:43,097 --> 00:28:49,645
Yes, I love Kepler! And his treatise is
really something, it's such a great book!

348
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,607
That's interesting, please go on!

349
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,739
Snowflakes are of a hexagonal star shape
and there must be reason for that.

350
00:29:00,156 --> 00:29:04,702
For if it is a coincidence, why there are
no pentagonal or septangular snowflakes?

351
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:05,994
You!

352
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:10,458
What are you hiding in there?

353
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:13,043
I can see everything. What do you have in
there?

354
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:17,089
I believe you! You'll make an excellent
geologist, give me your mark book!

355
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:23,137
I can see everything, everything, no, no.
What's there under your, under your skirt?

356
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,513
Under my skirt? My legs.

357
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,891
Yeah right! But your legs are with cheats.

358
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:31,187
This girl here is quoting Kepler,
and look at you!

359
00:29:34,815 --> 00:29:36,150
I'll need to have those.

360
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,160
Yes! What?

361
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,538
Wait, are you sure?

362
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,349
My son was born.

363
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,519
Congratulations!

364
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:14,230
4 girls in 3 years!

365
00:30:14,522 --> 00:30:17,191
I mean 3 in 4 years. My son!

366
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:22,431
Girl can't be a proper geologist.

367
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,908
She can't carry the rock, it's too hard.

368
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:28,994
And once she gets married...

369
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:33,749
...she can say good-bye to the field works!

370
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,002
Everybody gets A! Give me your mark
books!

371
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:42,258
Look, it was the first time
I heard about that Kepler.

372
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:45,886
No, really, I opened my mouth and it just
came out.

373
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:49,667
It's absolutely different when the words
just come out of your mouth by themselves.

374
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,562
Well? 10 o'clock at Rodion's place? Don't
forget the dress code.

375
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:59,900
Anyone who comes in jeans will celebrate in the
street. Finally I'll see Nikolaeva's legs!!

376
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:02,444
So you're not interested in mine.

377
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,989
Did you find a dress?

378
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,783
We have our concept changed.

379
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,474
Dad will be coming to my place, with a team
of volcanologists.

380
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,795
And what am I supposed to do there without
you?

381
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,210
An A, mom...

382
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,980
...what do you mean 'how'? I studied!

383
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,630
Sasha!

384
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,426
Sasha, I'm sorry, I was very rude, this
morning,

385
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,012
But it was too unexpected. I wasn't ready.

386
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,389
And then I thought 'why not?' I'd love to.

387
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,061
I'd love to.

388
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:37,812
How's that?

389
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,357
You'd love to do what?

390
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,569
Well, meet your dad, and...

391
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:44,695
Kolya...

392
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:48,032
Seven billion people live on the earth! You
have a huge selection!

393
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,797
Ok, let's go.

394
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:05,507
- Where to?
- You'll by the stand-by.

395
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:14,724
There he is!

396
00:32:18,687 --> 00:32:19,480
Kolya...

397
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,106
that guy is insane.

398
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:23,067
He's been following me since this morning.

399
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:24,859
Do something!

400
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,069
Like what?

401
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,864
Like asking him to leave.

402
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,032
Will he leave?

403
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,576
Depends on how you ask him.

404
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,161
Sasha, let me do that.

405
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,412
Don't!

406
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,289
What's his name?

407
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,542
What's the difference?! Shall I'll go?

408
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,793
Stop!

409
00:32:55,391 --> 00:32:56,809
You probably want to hit me?

410
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:58,643
Me?

411
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:00,515
I've already been hit today.

412
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,261
They even knocked out my tooth.

413
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,453
Is it OK now?

414
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:19,998
Ok!

415
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,335
Sasha!

416
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,547
He makes denture on his own!

417
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,090
Ok!

418
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:32,928
Kolya...

419
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,740
...you go, I can do it myself, got it?

420
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,764
Young man!

421
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:37,807
...turn around!

422
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,309
Turn around!

423
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,311
...and go!

424
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,147
Go!

425
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,986
Don't just stand. You go the other way!
Both of you!

426
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,864
The psycho...

427
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,950
the coward and the lover-boy.

428
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,285
Who's the lover-boy?

429
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,910
Valera.

430
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:02,666
I called him on Skype, and there was a
naked body with no head, but in panties.
Red panties.

431
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
So who was that?

432
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:08,303
Who's what? I'm telling you there was no
head, I'm unable to identify a person by
one's panties.

433
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:32,154
No, I think he's not a psycho.

434
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:37,201
- Why's that?
- He has a nice coat and rhetorical twists. He has a nice coat and rhetorical twists.

435
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,746
You're telling me you
still believe in angels?

436
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,706
Well, I concede their existence.

437
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:45,751
Hi, dad.

438
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:48,128
Sasha, we have a snow flurry here, so they
have delayed the flight!

439
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:49,630
And what about the New Year?

440
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,005
We can deal with that.

441
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:53,549
OK, see you!

442
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,804
He'll be late. Non-flying weather.

443
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:15,447
Just look at this. Our young volunteer is
repairing the trolley.

444
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,786
Sash, can I have him?

445
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,914
In your dreams. I'm gonna need him myself.

446
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,999
Come on in.

447
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,095
Seraphim! Could you please help me today?

448
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,014
Sure, angels were created to help people.

449
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,126
Ok, then could you please tell everyone
you're my boyfriend?

450
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,855
Ok, but I'll be around
only until 12 o'clock.

451
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,983
Well, that's just great,
exactly what I need.

452
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,652
Dog in the manger, like always.

453
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:58,615
Look! They're eating each other!

454
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,371
It's called a kiss.

455
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,081
They are French.

456
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:11,295
- Is that a French kiss?
- Yes, Seraphim, and if you want I could
explain it to you in details, but not here.

457
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,381
Easy! Get yourself a boyfriend and you can
explain it to him then.

458
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,302
Seraphim, what are you doing tomorrow?

459
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,846
I won't be here tomorrow.

460
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,556
Got that?

461
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,933
- Now relax!
- Can't! Until I gorge something.

462
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,393
Let's go there.

463
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,353
Come on, hurry!

464
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,273
Here you go, Bon Appйtit!

465
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:32,774
Thanks!

466
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,701
This is our favorite place. We often come
here, and play this game.

467
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,536
The game is called 'guess'.

468
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:48,956
There!

469
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,668
You have to guess his name and
profession.

470
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,546
It's Leonid, some middle manager.

471
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,673
Pavel, photographer!

472
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,982
He's name is Boris. He's a dermatologist.

473
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,803
Go check that out.

474
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,067
Just wandering there without knowing he's
being watched.

475
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,026
Yes.

476
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,572
It's very much similar to the
way we look at you from there.

477
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,160
So what do you feel up there?

478
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,496
Love!

479
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,277
His name is Boris and he's an artist!

480
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,802
It seems you flopped, mister Red-Hot! Turns
out it's not everything you know.

481
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,052
He's a dermatologist.

482
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:45,164
Well he guessed the name at least!

483
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:48,622
Never mind, maybe he was distracted.

484
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,812
And Seraphim here was just confessing his
love to me.

485
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,229
Already?

486
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:54,689
Shall I go?

487
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,191
No why?! I love you too.

488
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:02,989
That's cool.

489
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:07,411
No, wait. Maybe you could specify your
choice?

490
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:08,828
How?

491
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,664
I love you both.

492
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,709
- And you too.
- Thanks.

493
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,751
Lover-boy for sure.

494
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,965
What do you mean by saying 'I love you'?

495
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:21,549
Love.

496
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,804
I love everybody. Absolutely everybody!

497
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:28,974
It's some daisy chain.

498
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:36,440
Come on, let's explain to our representative
of supernatural powers, what "love" is.

499
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:42,487
Well, love is, when a man and a woman
meet and there happens a spark.

500
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,488
Spark?

501
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:50,704
Well yes, or attraction! When you go
around and don't think of anyone or
anything, and you don't notice anything...

502
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,126
and the pleasantry for life escalates, and
you eat without getting fat.

503
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,337
- So you're saying that love is...
- A game.

504
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:00,797
People play and play that game, and then
break up.

505
00:39:02,466 --> 00:39:03,466
Break up?

506
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:07,304
Well, of course, everything tends to end
sooner or later.

507
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,141
You know, the summer, traffic, coffee,
cigarettes...

508
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:12,933
sugar, night...

509
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,143
...and love.

510
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,896
I don't think so!

511
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,073
That's the reason you don't have a
boyfriend!

512
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,823
Sorry!

513
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,039
- Where are you going? Stop!
- Can't you see a man is being beaten?

514
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:36,375
Are you some kind of a superhero? What do
you care?

515
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,962
Hey guys! What are you doing? It's New
Year coming. Leave the man alone.

516
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:43,131
What do you want, fat?

517
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:44,883
I'm fat?

518
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,319
- That's cool!
- Get up, hurry! Come on.

519
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,723
You like Negroes.

520
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:53,725
Hold her.

521
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:56,686
- Oh you bitch!
- Don't touch her!

522
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,315
Take your hands off her.

523
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:10,033
What do you want?

524
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:15,330
Take your filthy hands off me, macaque!

525
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,920
What's wrong?

526
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,172
What's wrong?

527
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,782
Is this the shit I've been smoking?

528
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,135
I'm gonna feel sick.

529
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,762
Hey guys, what's wrong? Stop fucking
around!

530
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:42,607
Amazing! Amazing! This is quite an unique
case, sudden pigmentation!

531
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:46,194
You know, you come to my clinic. I'm a
dermatologist...

532
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,250
- Go fuck yourself, dermatologist!
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

533
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,286
Unbelievable!

534
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,539
Boris Anatolyevich, dermatologist.

535
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,791
Well, Boris Anatolyevich...

536
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,294
...Candidate of Medical Science, why did
you lie?

537
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:10,343
You know, when such a beautiful girl approached me in the street,
I couldn't work up the courage and say...

538
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,846
'I'm a dermatologist'.

539
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,641
Yes, you're so beautiful!

540
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:19,394
You have blood.

541
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:25,609
I'm a nice person,
the faculty of "gas field machinery."

542
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:27,986
My dad is a king.

543
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,199
I want to take care of you. For a long time.
As long as you want.

544
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,119
Great, you got the angel, I got the prince.

545
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:38,371
Let's go stitch up your face, Prince.

546
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,190
Wow! So my boyfriend is an angel?

547
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,575
I could imagine my father come and see I've
turned black.

548
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:18,036
He has no father, only mom.

549
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,604
Come on, I don't believe it.
I don't believe you're an angel.

550
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't believe him, sis, I'm the angel!

551
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:29,506
- No, I'm the one!
- You're both angels, let's go.

552
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,509
I'm an Angel. He's not!

553
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,011
So you're an angel?

554
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,931
Well, come on. Since you're an angel. Show
me something!

555
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:39,474
What?

556
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,768
I don't know. Some miracle.

557
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,603
Come on!

558
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,564
What would you want?

559
00:42:48,942 --> 00:42:50,986
What would I want?

560
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,531
As a child I had a dream...

561
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,002
...that I'm walking in the street.
Then I hear this voice calling me.

562
00:42:59,703 --> 00:43:01,746
I turn around, and see this...

563
00:43:02,455 --> 00:43:04,082
two meters tall...

564
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,378
handsome young man, who tells me...

565
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,380
Can I have your papers?

566
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:16,803
Hi!

567
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,849
Jeeze!

568
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,521
Do you need some special invitation or
something?

569
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,315
I don't have any papers.

570
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,983
How come?

571
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:32,360
Who are you? Where did you come from?

572
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:34,696
- Hey guys, he's a foreigner.
- All the more so.

573
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,365
Where's your registration, ghoul?

574
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:39,034
I'm not a ghoul. I'm an angel.

575
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,202
Then you're going our way, get in the car.

576
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,539
Hey guys. The New Year's near at hand, is
there...

577
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,208
an amicable way we could resolve this?

578
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,127
Amicable? What do you mean by that?

579
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,502
Well...

580
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:53,005
Five?

581
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,592
Ten?

582
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,012
Twenty thousand?

583
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,806
No way! We take no bribes!

584
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,811
This is similar to antlers!

585
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:08,855
You want a deer?

586
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,859
Well, yeah right, take me...

587
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,653
to your deer, deer.

588
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:18,947
A deer!

589
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,660
A deer!

590
00:44:25,664 --> 00:44:27,945
Three zeroes speaking, we have a deer
here in front of us.

591
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:29,208
A deer!

592
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,711
Just be here in a minute. We don't have
enough men.

593
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,672
- Here you go!
- Thanks!

594
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:36,466
Hurry or I'll break your balls.

595
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:40,929
Where did they go? They wanted this deer,
didn't they?

596
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,306
They did!

597
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,224
Now!

598
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,393
We got the deer.

599
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:47,852
The next shot!

600
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,939
Where are the loving couples?

601
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:52,774
Here they are!

602
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:56,820
Who are you?

603
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:58,655
Your assistant.

604
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,323
Then assist!

605
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:05,495
I need some looks. And I asked for a loving
couple...

606
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,498
...not the housing office
workers on strike!

607
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:12,794
Your green tea.

608
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:16,126
Hey guys, any chance you could stand in
the background for this shot, please?

609
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:21,511
- And what should we do?
- The director will tell you everything, you won't be paid of course! Is that all right?

610
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,304
Come on, come on!

611
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,143
Let's go!

612
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,478
So what do you think?

613
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:32,021
- Hi!
- Hi!

614
00:45:32,939 --> 00:45:33,939
Marvelous!

615
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,734
Marvelous!

616
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:39,571
All right, now, you've just met! You don't
know each other well enough, but you like
each other.

617
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:47,946
Don't look into the camera. Look at each
other! Eye to eye, up to the 'cut' command.

618
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,249
Should we kiss each other?

619
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,084
- Kiss?
- Kiss?

620
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:57,380
No. There's no way you can kiss.
It's just the beginning of your relationship.

621
00:45:57,881 --> 00:46:05,221
You just look at each other and the magic
feeling conceives in your soul.

622
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,099
Like a flower.

623
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:09,934
It's your destiny!

624
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,353
It's your destiny, understand?

625
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:17,484
I'll kill on the spot any of you who
looks into the camera or kisses.

626
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:19,360
Please approve the costumes.

627
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:23,198
Ready to shoot! Snow, wind-blower, camera!

628
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,450
Come on, guys, follow her.

629
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:28,495
Action!

630
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:29,788
- Action!
- Got it!

631
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:31,372
Camera!

632
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,752
Scene 36. Shot three. Take one.

633
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,713
Let's do it!

634
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:44,969
I can't, I'm sorry. Let me just...

635
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,908
Stop!

636
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,495
Young man!

637
00:47:10,954 --> 00:47:12,997
Young man, you, come here!

638
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:26,002
Come here! You need to be in the movies.
Your face is amazing, it simply shines in
shot.

639
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:28,471
And mine?

640
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,056
Yours doesn't.

641
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:38,189
It just doesn't. You have to work on your
internal alimentation.

642
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,692
Ok, what do we have next?

643
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,070
SCENE 37.

644
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:52,453
Then they'll show it in theatres.
On such big screens.

645
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,539
Why?

646
00:47:54,914 --> 00:48:00,628
What do you mean why? In order to...
Fuck! Simple things are so hard to be explained.

647
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,923
Why do you keep saying the word 'fuck'?
What does it mean?

648
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:07,343
Well, it means...

649
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:13,600
it's the analogue of another word, which
means...

650
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:17,353
...a woman of bad behavior, so to say.

651
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:22,150
What's her name? Do you know her?

652
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:24,652
Who?

653
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,446
That woman?

654
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,782
Oh, fuck! You're gonna blow my mind!

655
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,494
We just say it for no special reason.

656
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,747
Don't bark, Jorik!

657
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,627
Jorik!

658
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:42,503
Jorik!

659
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,131
Jorik!

660
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,348
Some fucking New Year!

661
00:48:55,642 --> 00:48:57,310
The dog's dead.

662
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:00,772
Jesus!

663
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,317
Seraphim, do something,

664
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,570
Help us! Jorik!

665
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:12,241
Could you check him please? I think he has
a pulse. I'm afraid to!

666
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:14,452
- Anybody!
- Jorik!

667
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:18,790
Jorik!

668
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:20,750
It's gonna be all right.

669
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,543
Jorik!

670
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,257
Get up!

671
00:49:28,967 --> 00:49:30,134
Come on!

672
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,012
Get up!

673
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,895
Jorik, you scared me, you scared your
mammy, stupid,

674
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,232
- Thank you so much!
- Happy coming New Year, Jora!

675
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,995
Did you see that? How's it possible?

676
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,791
Hello! Yes!

677
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,462
So I'm the one who puzzles you?

678
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,715
Maybe you puzzle me?

679
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,307
Valer, look enough blowing my mind.

680
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:22,436
What?

681
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:25,481
Fuck you, Valer!

682
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:40,705
Do you think you could make someone so
ugly...

683
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:44,709
that all the girls would
not even touch him with a ten foot pole?

684
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:46,169
No, I can't!

685
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:50,131
Why the hell do I need you then?

686
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:52,506
And what do girls usually do with their
boyfriends?

687
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,012
I could tell you that...

688
00:50:57,138 --> 00:50:58,639
but you'll faint then.

689
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:02,143
Please note, only the most powerful and
stable angels are sent to Russia!

690
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,771
Yeah right!

691
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,661
Ok, can you carry anything heavy at least?

692
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,623
I see. That's enough, put it down.

693
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:25,333
Thanks.

694
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:34,717
Seraphim, Seraphim!

695
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:38,471
I'm here!

696
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,643
- I'm here!
- I can see you.

697
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,938
Come to me! Now you understand.

698
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,830
I'm telling myself every year 'go
and get the presents beforehand'!

699
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,071
Presents? You mean gifts. Offerings?

700
00:51:56,906 --> 00:52:03,329
Something like that. But not so smugly. It's more of an expression
of high regard, love, and so on. The thing is to guess.

701
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,259
By the way, what should I present to my
dad?

702
00:52:06,582 --> 00:52:07,750
He wants skis.

703
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:10,294
- Skis?
- Skis.

704
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:41,367
Watch it!

705
00:52:41,742 --> 00:52:44,412
This is an advertising campaign. Want to
try?

706
00:52:49,208 --> 00:52:51,377
- Is this champagne?
- Yes.

707
00:52:53,004 --> 00:52:53,671
We'd like to.

708
00:52:53,921 --> 00:52:54,921
We need to pay.

709
00:52:57,216 --> 00:52:59,302
No, there's no need. Put it back.

710
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,096
- It's free, isn't it?
- Yes.

711
00:53:05,183 --> 00:53:06,392
Thanks!

712
00:53:08,769 --> 00:53:12,398
- We can't do this!
- Everybody can do anything today.

713
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,750
Well?

714
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:34,712
Like it?

715
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,714
I feel dizzy.

716
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:38,633
That's good!

717
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:41,886
Let's go!

718
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:44,305
I feel so dizzy.

719
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,558
May I? Thanks

720
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,902
What happened to her head?

721
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:02,823
Because a woman with no head, is an ideal
woman!

722
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:05,034
Ideal woman?

723
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,291
Oh, that's just great!

724
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,880
This dress goes well with your head.

725
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:29,016
Present it to the girl.

726
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:32,061
Is it what guys do?

727
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,480
Sort of.

728
00:54:39,568 --> 00:54:40,987
We'll take it.

729
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:45,699
What's this?

730
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:51,289
With this coin, King Henry of Navarre
redeemed from captivity his friend, Count
Antoine de Martignac...

731
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:55,334
...then it was among those with which the
Chateau de Royale castle was bought...

732
00:54:56,127 --> 00:55:00,298
Then it was put in a chest where it stayed
for a hundred years, but was stolen during
the fire in 1745...

733
00:55:00,423 --> 00:55:01,507
Stop.

734
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:04,719
We don't take foreign currency.

735
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,350
Where are you going? Stop, stop!

736
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:15,896
Stop!
He stole your coin!

737
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,732
The waiter!

738
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,152
That's OK, he needs it more than I do.

739
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:22,945
Just do something!

740
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,197
Nothing needs to be done.

741
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,074
He needs it more, really.

742
00:55:30,411 --> 00:55:31,954
You're so saint that I feel sick.

743
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,711
The smell of a true man. How is he
supposed to smell?

744
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,046
It depends.

745
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:46,886
Try it!

746
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,894
Oh, Seraphim! That's enough.

747
00:55:56,729 --> 00:55:58,773
Do I smell like a real man? Smell it.

748
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,157
Do I?

749
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,835
You smell absolutely different.

750
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,772
Sure, the perfume unfolds different ways
with different persons.

751
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:26,050
Young man, this is your aroma, take it!

752
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,803
- My aroma?
- Young man!

753
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:33,516
- You don't need it.
- But he said it's my aroma!

754
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,393
Just trust me!

755
00:56:36,185 --> 00:56:37,545
Miss, please check this new aroma.

756
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:41,899
What is she doing?

757
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:45,485
Dancing.

758
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,154
Why?

759
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,492
She's in a good mood.

760
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:55,037
I'm in a good mood too.
But I'm not dancing.

761
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:57,706
Why?

762
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,877
In a whirlwind of gay couples whirl...

763
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,630
We've almost said good-bye to this year...

764
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,383
- Get a music centre for your briney...
- Seraphim!

765
00:57:08,509 --> 00:57:13,139
- Everybody's looking at us!
- So what! I'm in a good mood. Let's dance!

766
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:16,183
Please! Come on!

767
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:18,686
Stop!

768
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:20,771
Put your hand on my waist.

769
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,065
- Where?
- My waist.

770
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,568
Let's dance like her.

771
00:57:59,268 --> 00:58:00,769
I feel dizzy.

772
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,566
It's good, you're supposed to.

773
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,546
Nice job, old man!

774
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:29,340
I'm not an old man. I'm a guy!

775
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,133
Her boyfriend!

776
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:34,470
Well, man, your girlfriend is the prettiest
ever.

777
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,096
Thanks!

778
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,349
She's my girlfriend just for one day!

779
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,481
Girlfriend for one day?

780
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,191
Yes, sure!

781
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,365
I'm not your girlfriend at all.

782
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,163
Sasha!

783
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,241
Sasha!

784
00:59:49,545 --> 00:59:50,546
Sasha!

785
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:56,926
Wait!

786
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,556
Wait!

787
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,391
What?

788
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,144
You forgot the skis!

789
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:10,482
Keep them. You still have time to ski.
There's plenty of time till 12 o'clock.

790
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:39,261
Varv?

791
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:41,305
Where are you?

792
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,976
At home! Treating the prince. He doesn't want
to go to hospital. He prefers grandma's home.

793
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:49,438
Listen, I checked the encyclopedia. Angel
means 'a messenger'.

794
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,693
Sasha, if he's an angel, then there's a good reason for
that!! Understand? He's here to deliver a message.

795
01:00:55,069 --> 01:00:56,862
So nail him down, and make him talk!

796
01:00:57,237 --> 01:01:00,491
There's nobody to nail down, we broke up!

797
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:04,119
Broke up? Come to my place! Grandma
misses you.

798
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,872
Prince made some chops.

799
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,668
Hey, some Olympian! Olympian!

800
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:13,879
Just look at this guy.

801
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:17,007
What's he doing? Not bad, huh?

802
01:01:17,675 --> 01:01:19,009
I'm gonna call you back.

803
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:24,306
- He's skiing for the first time!
- Oh come on.

804
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:26,767
Oh come on! Ninety miles an hour!

805
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:30,396
First time, my ass! No matter how good the
skier is...

806
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,940
the lay of line is too hard.

807
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:34,983
He loves hard lays.

808
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:42,825
Hey, shall we stop? The guy is gonna trip
over.

809
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,786
He's not a guy.

810
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:48,831
Step on it, please!

811
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:49,665
What?

812
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,083
Step on it!

813
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:00,842
Get out!

814
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:07,725
Sitting in my car. Get out! Get out!

815
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,269
Ok, I'm out.

816
01:02:10,728 --> 01:02:13,439
How can you treat him like that? How can
you all treat us like that?

817
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,069
We love you, ready to break our necks for
you, so that you can give yourself airs.

818
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:21,804
- You'll step on it at home!
- What?

819
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,949
You know what I mean by 'it'!

820
01:02:24,867 --> 01:02:26,285
You heard me!

821
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,871
Hey! Olympian!

822
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:39,506
They ski just fine.

823
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,383
Dad's gonna love them.

824
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:46,263
Sasha, I said you're my girlfriend for one day,
but for me that means my entire life. Do you understand?

825
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:52,352
No, no!
Love is a real and earthy feeling...

826
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:55,105
...and it requires another person to be
nearby...

827
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,859
- ...to feel his touches.
- Ok, touch me!

828
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:00,778
I don't believe this.

829
01:03:01,904 --> 01:03:03,947
Wait. Wait!

830
01:03:04,198 --> 01:03:05,574
Wait. Wait!

831
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,660
Why? You wanted us to kiss each other?

832
01:03:09,912 --> 01:03:11,079
Me? With you?

833
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:14,625
Look at yourself. You're not even a man!

834
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:20,631
But I smell like a real man!

835
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,884
No, you smell of magic!

836
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:30,516
Like an angel, I don't know. But that has
nothing in common with a man!

837
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:33,685
Ok, then. What shall I do? Tell me!

838
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,312
I don't know...

839
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,149
If a man asks such a question,
then he's not a man at all!

840
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:14,017
Let's go, Vitya!

841
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,483
Oh! It's them again. Skiing.

842
01:04:21,859 --> 01:04:25,195
I'll hit them on the head with those
skis if something goes wrong.

843
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,989
- So, what happened this time?
- Hurry, please. I don't know, he just fell!

844
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,199
He fell?

845
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,452
- He won't say a thing.
- Nothing new!

846
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,037
Where does it hurt?

847
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:36,122
Here!

848
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,793
That's because you've been skiing with
broken ribs!

849
01:04:40,127 --> 01:04:42,588
How come they're broken? He's been
walking today!

850
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:45,090
He's been flying today as well. Come on,
put him on the stretcher.

851
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,009
Vitya, just put him.

852
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:56,143
Your hand is so warm!

853
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,104
What does it mean?

854
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,608
- It means your heart pumps blood, for the
time being.
- The heart.

855
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:05,569
Are you sure you're an angel?

856
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:10,616
Could you please take
his skis off at least?

857
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,204
Don't just stand there!

858
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:19,333
Press your chest against!

859
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,586
I said 'press your chest against'!

860
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:28,258
I said press your chest against!

861
01:05:34,014 --> 01:05:36,850
I don't get it. Is this a dance invitation?

862
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:39,394
You said 'press your chest against'.

863
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:45,275
Dear! See I'm bald?

864
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:50,113
That means I love women, and women love
me.

865
01:05:55,077 --> 01:05:56,203
Don't breathe!

866
01:05:58,413 --> 01:05:59,413
Give me your labs.

867
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,166
Blood, urinalysis.

868
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:08,839
Miss!

869
01:06:09,257 --> 01:06:10,550
Are you waiting for X-Rays?

870
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:14,763
No.

871
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,433
Stay here, don't cry. Everything's cured
nowadays.

872
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,018
They'll fix you!

873
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:22,396
What the fuck is this?

874
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:26,483
- Why isn't it working? What's going on?
- Doc!

875
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,194
Doc, here are the shots!

876
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:32,781
I'm sorry, ma'am! But my X-Ray is broken.

877
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:34,783
The shots!

878
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:39,621
- I don't need these.
- Just do the X-Ray photography. Nobody
agrees to see us without it!

879
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:43,125
Pavlik, Pavlik!

880
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,626
Pavlik, come here!

881
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:47,087
Let the doctor see you.

882
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,131
See?

883
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:51,842
He's entirely black now.

884
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,719
Mom!

885
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:02,936
So he's going to be black
for the rest of his life?

886
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,106
Depends on him.

887
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:10,652
Does anything depend on us?

888
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,071
Everything.

889
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:21,038
No, if I completely believe you're an angel,
I'll go nuts!

890
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,208
People don't go nuts because
they believe in angels!

891
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,508
What are they doing?

892
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,597
Acting the goat.

893
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:40,724
Who's the goat?

894
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,680
Just put the skis. Here he is!

895
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:19,012
I love acting the goat!

896
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,766
Me too!

897
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:44,079
Of course, it's not exactly a slide.
We have some slide in Kamchatka...

898
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:47,231
where you're literally flying a mile and
yelling: mamaaaa...

899
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,921
...and mom is standing beneath and
laughing.

900
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,302
And then...

901
01:08:59,678 --> 01:09:01,721
...she left me.

902
01:09:03,849 --> 01:09:05,142
Left you?

903
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,478
On the 31st of December...

904
01:09:09,855 --> 01:09:11,898
they went with dad to the mountains...

905
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,442
...there was an avalanche...

906
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:16,653
...and mom was gone,

907
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:19,739
They loved each other so much. And what?

908
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,117
Did that love save her?

909
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:23,367
No!

910
01:09:23,785 --> 01:09:30,417
That's why I know I need to live here and
now, because nothing's gonna be then.

911
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:07,787
I'm tired of miracles.

912
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,583
I just want you to be an ordinary man.

913
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,168
An ordinary man?

914
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:16,963
How do you do that?

915
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:20,717
It's very easy. Ordinary people go on a
visit...

916
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:23,720
hide presents under the Christmas tree...

917
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:25,972
...watch old movies, make wishes...

918
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:27,641
And then?

919
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,644
Then they go to sleep.

920
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:32,896
And then?

921
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:35,899
And then nothing! There's only "here and
now".

922
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:40,695
And now I want to kiss you more than
anything.

923
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:43,365
Sasha, I can't do that!

924
01:10:43,782 --> 01:10:45,825
But breaking into my life was not a problem
for you!

925
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,091
Seraphim!

926
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:07,096
Yes, dad!

927
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,350
- Sasha! I love you so much!
- What?

928
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:14,604
Don't be afraid of anything. I love you very much! Don't
be afraid of anything. My dear girl, I love you so much!!

929
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,648
What dad? Dad, I can't hear you!

930
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:20,068
Do you hear me?! I love you very much!

931
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:22,361
Hello!

932
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:28,994
No, no, no, no!

933
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:52,093
I'm sorry, please, I need a phone like this,
urgently!

934
01:11:52,225 --> 01:11:53,310
One minute please!

935
01:11:56,438 --> 01:12:00,859
As we were informed by the press-service of
Ministry of Emergency Situations of
Russia...

936
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,487
...Su-825 took off from
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky 12:03 Moscow
time. After overcoming some 500
kilometers...

937
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,983
the crew discovered a combustion of one of
the engines

938
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:12,912
what disrupted the navigation systems. The
crew is doing everything possible to land.

939
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:15,540
The situation is complicated by bad weather
conditions. It's been heavily snowing there
for three hours now.

940
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,876
Miss, your cell phone is fine.

941
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:20,503
Hurry, please, my dad's there!

942
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:29,554
The liner has 132 people on board,
including 7 crew members. All services of
the airport are on high alert...

943
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:32,004
The subscriber's machine is switched o_ or
out of reach.

944
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:34,184
...they have special duty doctors,
ambulances...

945
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:40,815
It was the latest news in the last half an
hour, We will monitor all the further
developments.

946
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:38,123
I asked you to get my mom back...

947
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,667
you didn't...

948
01:13:43,128 --> 01:13:45,171
If you take my father...

949
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:48,550
I will never believe again. Got that?

950
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:08,862
You could also, pray to the Guardian-angel!

951
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,322
Here he is!

952
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:15,076
This one deceived me completely.

953
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,246
- The Angel?
- That's right!

954
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,211
Hello! Dad!

955
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:26,545
Sasha, everything's ok.

956
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,048
I'm alive. Don't worry.

957
01:14:30,008 --> 01:14:32,051
We just landed.

958
01:14:32,427 --> 01:14:33,470
Daddy!

959
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,563
We'll be flying to Moscow in an hour. I'm
OK.

960
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:39,184
Hello, hello, dad!

961
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,520
Great!

962
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,358
Thanks!

963
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:49,110
Dad's alive!

964
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,365
May I?

965
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:01,122
Nice work. You deserved thanks.

966
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,545
Come on in. Take them o_.

967
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,468
Give me the candy.

968
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:15,762
Give it to me.

969
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:19,098
Keep your voices down. Or I'll
tell the Lord you're not behaving.

970
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,096
And I'll tell him you steal
candies from the factory.

971
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:24,562
What are you saying?

972
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,405
I'm sorry.

973
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:37,784
Are you the packer number 5? Red October
factory?

974
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:41,162
Why?

975
01:15:42,789 --> 01:15:45,500
If you don't stop doing that,
they'll fire you.

976
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,670
Jeeze! I wasn't taking much.

977
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:51,631
I won't do it anyway!

978
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,495
Could you please tell me what time it is?

979
01:17:05,705 --> 01:17:06,706
Sure!

980
01:17:08,416 --> 01:17:10,668
- It's ten!
- She's gonna kill me.

981
01:17:14,881 --> 01:17:16,924
You still had 2 hours left.

982
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,510
And you already vanished!

983
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:27,852
Rodion!

984
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,271
- You scared me!
- Why are you wandering here?

985
01:17:30,605 --> 01:17:33,483
You should be at my place in half an hour!
Get in. Come on, come on.

986
01:17:39,530 --> 01:17:44,077
So what's all that shit with Valera. He keeps
calling and telling me some angel stories.

987
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,872
Didn't he tell you anything about red
panties?

988
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,168
No. Nothing on that.

989
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:56,464
Stop here.

990
01:17:57,382 --> 01:17:59,842
No, I don't help blinkers on principle!

991
01:18:00,218 --> 01:18:01,678
Just stop it, will you?

992
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:13,022
Hey guys, could you please give me a ride?
It's only one block. The belt died!

993
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:15,900
Get in.

994
01:18:23,241 --> 01:18:24,534
Don't you recognize me?

995
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:29,914
No, I'm sorry.

996
01:18:31,416 --> 01:18:33,918
You actually took me to
the university today!

997
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:35,836
Me?

998
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:40,007
I have an official car. We're not
allowed to give anybody a ride!

999
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:53,521
I got this for my mom. For two years she
wouldn't talk to my wife.

1000
01:18:53,938 --> 01:18:55,982
And today she called...

1001
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,570
jittering. She said 'God
was about to punish me'.

1002
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:03,489
I asked 'what happened mammy'?

1003
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:07,702
She answered 'my dog was run over by a
car'.

1004
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:11,622
Because of that dog she pulled the chill on
with my wife.

1005
01:19:12,165 --> 01:19:14,208
One day she said 'my dog

1006
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,544
is better than your Lena'

1007
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,380
So did the dog survive?

1008
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,132
It's not that simple.

1009
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,925
This is what she told me.

1010
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:26,888
There was a man with a woman passing by,

1011
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:32,810
the woman put her hands on that dog, and it
revived!

1012
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,271
Some paranormalist vets?

1013
01:19:35,563 --> 01:19:37,607
Yes, I laughed myself.

1014
01:19:37,899 --> 01:19:39,942
But she was so serious, she said 'God,

1015
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:41,402
was about to punish me'.

1016
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:47,033
Could you stop it here?

1017
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,714
So, did you pass your exam?

1018
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:17,939
This is the creative idea.

1019
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:21,359
This firm really has some imagination,
although, I don't give a shit.

1020
01:20:21,943 --> 01:20:22,985
You can pick your wings!

1021
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,321
- No, thanks!
- You have to!

1022
01:20:26,322 --> 01:20:29,367
Young man, any chance we could be more
careful? Thank you.

1023
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,703
You stole our coin today?

1024
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,246
What coin?

1025
01:20:34,914 --> 01:20:36,994
Of the 16th century. With which King Henry
of Navarre

1026
01:20:37,250 --> 01:20:40,503
redeemed from captivity his friend, Memory
any better?
- I'm sorry, I'm not aware of any coin or
Henry?

1027
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:46,592
Young man, just keep up the work,
everything's OK. Sasha, come here!

1028
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,303
I'm sure it was him?

1029
01:20:49,887 --> 01:20:52,390
Sasha, listen, thanks!

1030
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:57,895
Look at me, look at me, look at me. Are you
OK?

1031
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,151
Well, I fell out of the window today.

1032
01:21:06,863 --> 01:21:11,701
I think I have something for you in the
kitchen, let's go!

1033
01:21:21,168 --> 01:21:23,212
Rodion!

1034
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:25,548
I won't let you out until you make friends!

1035
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:28,467
What? Rodion! Open it!

1036
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:33,306
- I'll break the lock!
- Feel free, you'll cover it with your
scholarship!

1037
01:21:36,434 --> 01:21:39,687
It was my sister, Marina, from Chelyabinsk!

1038
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:43,107
Valer, I don't care either way.

1039
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:53,701
Why are you being so disputatious?

1040
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,829
I'm not.

1041
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:59,415
Look! You're not saint yourself, are you?

1042
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:02,597
I thought we're modern people, and
perfectly understand each other.

1043
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:03,419
Valer!

1044
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,838
- Do you ski?
- Yes, I do!

1045
01:22:06,881 --> 01:22:08,925
What's your personal record?

1046
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:12,720
30 miles an hour!

1047
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,348
It's very little!

1048
01:22:18,893 --> 01:22:21,213
And do you know that there can't be 2
identical snowflakes.

1049
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:23,648
So what?

1050
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:30,571
Or did you know that Henry of Navarre spent his
last coin to redeem from captivity his best friend.

1051
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:36,827
Tell your tycoon skier that I'm gonna break
his face.

1052
01:22:39,497 --> 01:22:43,250
You can't do that! He can lift a bench with
one hand.

1053
01:22:53,177 --> 01:22:55,221
- Am I forgiven?
- Yes...

1054
01:22:56,806 --> 01:22:58,849
...now you can ask Rodion to open the door!

1055
01:22:59,684 --> 01:23:01,727
Rodion, open the door!

1056
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,025
Now a kiss!

1057
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:14,824
What are you doing?

1058
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,201
He suffered so much...

1059
01:23:17,535 --> 01:23:22,039
and Rodik left all his guests to come get
you. It's New Year!

1060
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:25,668
You won't understand!

1061
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:35,720
Seven billion people live on the Earth, and women make three and a
half billion. And beautiful women according to the statistics...

1062
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,263
Don't touch me!

1063
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,361
So who's this guy?

1064
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,364
I thought everybody's here.

1065
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:01,412
Friends!

1066
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:09,378
Imagine this picture - the park in the
morning, and a man is dying by the post.

1067
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:13,340
Everybody just passed by, except him!

1068
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:19,722
This is a man with a warm heart and powerful torso! If it
wasn't for him, you'd be coming in 3 days with red garlands!

1069
01:24:20,681 --> 01:24:21,766
How did you get here?

1070
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:24,268
You invited me, remember?

1071
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:32,901
Where have you been?

1072
01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:36,238
I brought your father's
skis and your dress!

1073
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:40,284
Sasha, what dress? Do you guys know each
other?

1074
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:42,036
Yes, sure.

1075
01:24:42,244 --> 01:24:44,914
- I'm her boyfriend.
- Then who am I?

1076
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:49,112
You were her boyfriend yesterday.

1077
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:51,670
Me? Yesterday?

1078
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,216
Valera, Valera!

1079
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:59,220
Marina from Chelyabinsk loves you very
much, she's waiting for you.

1080
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,234
Where's my dress?

1081
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,969
You came back for good?

1082
01:25:41,512 --> 01:25:43,139
Depends on you.

1083
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:45,641
How's that?

1084
01:25:47,268 --> 01:25:52,523
Sasha, people have the
greatest gift ever...

1085
01:25:53,149 --> 01:25:55,609
the freedom. You have to decide for
yourself.

1086
01:25:58,696 --> 01:26:00,739
Can we be together?

1087
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:06,495
Yes, we can live together, long and even
happy, and we'll have children.

1088
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,040
But heaven for me will be closed forever
then.

1089
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,419
Why?

1090
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:15,796
They don't receive fallen angels.

1091
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:18,507
What shall we do?

1092
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:21,927
It's up to you to decide.
If you say so, I'll stay.

1093
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:29,685
I feel dizzy.

1094
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:36,942
Jeeze, you're saying all the time 'love,
love' and I learned just now what love is!

1095
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,736
One!

1096
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,201
I can't do this. I'm not ready.
Don't do this to me.

1097
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,661
Five, six!

1098
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:51,999
Ok, go! No, wait!

1099
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:59,298
Wait, you kept telling me that for everything
there's a good reason. So, why are you here?

1100
01:26:59,924 --> 01:27:01,967
Eight! Nine!

1101
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,386
You'll understand it someday.

1102
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,556
Ten! Eleven!

1103
01:27:09,308 --> 01:27:10,768
Go.

1104
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:13,229
Twelve!

1105
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,960
Sash!

1106
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,212
Happy New Year, sweet!

1107
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:41,173
I had a phone call to take.

1108
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:47,304
He flew away!

1109
01:27:49,056 --> 01:27:52,851
- You should've held him!
- I let him go!

1110
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:56,563
- You shouldn't have done that!
- Don't cry, he'll be back.

1111
01:28:07,324 --> 01:28:12,705
Happy New Year Sasha! I'm at the airport!! But I won't be able
to reach home! My flight is in 2 hours! Could you come here?

1112
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,824
Wait, Wait!

1113
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:52,703
Here, forgive me,
I couldn't resist back then.

1114
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,165
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

1115
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:40,709
Dad!

1116
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,720
Hey!

1117
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:52,638
What?

1118
01:29:52,805 --> 01:29:55,432
- Great dress!
- Like it?

1119
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,477
I lost Seryoga! What a fool?

1120
01:30:02,106 --> 01:30:03,148
Shall we go?

1121
01:30:06,276 --> 01:30:10,489
We were flying in circles over the airfield.
Everybody screaming, crying, praying,

1122
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,327
and I called you, I thought I needed to hear your voice at least.
Dad!

1123
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:23,702
Suddenly the plane started to dive down,
and everything was calm, and the light was
On.

1124
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:28,132
In five minutes we safely landed. Can you
imagine it?

1125
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:29,716
Yes!

1126
01:30:35,305 --> 01:30:36,348
Dad!

1127
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,893
Did you love mom very much?

1128
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:45,607
Yes, and I still love her.

1129
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,159
It seems Reykjavik was just announced.

1130
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,204
- Time to go.
- Dad! I got these skis for you!

1131
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,831
How did you guess?

1132
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:04,822
Great. I'll pick them on my way back! I
completely forgot!

1133
01:31:05,586 --> 01:31:12,551
In hurry we were pushed on different flights, and Seryoga forgot
his ticket. He'll be flying in a day. Could you pass this?

1134
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:14,178
Yes, sure!

1135
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:15,762
That's great!

1136
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:39,570
Such nice hospital, doctors drunk, nurses drunk, the patient
with a dropper drunk too! No limits! You should've come!

1137
01:31:50,506 --> 01:31:53,592
Miss, is this the 5th building?

1138
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:57,971
Seraphim?

1139
01:31:58,597 --> 01:31:59,890
My name is Sergey,

1140
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:03,060
and you are Sasha?

1141
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:05,062
San Sanich's daughter?

1142
01:32:05,646 --> 01:32:10,192
I came to see you. I lost him, and
he told me you have my tickets.

1143
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:17,282
Well, do you have my airplane tickets?

1144
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,034
Yes, sure.

1145
01:32:24,498 --> 01:32:27,084
Great, that was so stupid.

1146
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:31,755
You're very much like your photo.

1147
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:34,007
Which one?

1148
01:32:34,383 --> 01:32:36,426
Sanich has it on his wall.

1149
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,013
It's not me, it's my mom.

1150
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,265
I see!

1151
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:44,393
- She's a very beautiful woman!
- Thanks!

1152
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:47,145
Your mom.

1153
01:32:55,028 --> 01:33:01,577
Ok, I've gotta catch my plane. Thank you so
much. Good-bye!

1154
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,831
Sergey!

1155
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:10,043
Your jacket is dirty!

1156
01:33:17,134 --> 01:33:19,177
And what should we do with it?

1
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,486
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

2
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:23,895
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

3
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,030
I'll be right behind the wall

4
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,675
In 370BC, the Warring States China

5
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,774
Zhao Nation dispatched 100,000 warriors

6
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:45,718
led by Xiang Yanzhong, to attack Yan Nation

7
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,984
LIANG stands right on his path to Yan

8
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:50,890
There's no way she can
resist Zhao's mighty troop

9
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:53,291
and will be definitely taken as buffer

10
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,461
Their only chance for survival is to

11
00:00:56,498 --> 00:00:57,897
ask for the help of Mozi warrior

12
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,662
who are experts in defending

13
00:01:01,336 --> 00:01:02,633
but...

14
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,800
as Liang teeters on the edge of peril

15
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,706
Mozi warriors...

16
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,643
still didn't arrive

17
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:24,455
Father, we must fight

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,060
Zhao's Commander
Xiang Yanzhong is a brilliant strategist

19
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:34,467
His advance troop has already arrived

20
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:36,766
We have to take action now

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:40,138
before the arrival of their main force

22
00:01:40,175 --> 00:01:42,575
we must surrender

23
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,603
otherwise, we're all done for

24
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:53,445
Fighting with bare hands...

25
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,747
ends up the same...

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,685
My Lord

27
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,426
My Lord

28
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:05,763
what if the Mozi army were to make it here?

29
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:12,203
Assemble at the Gate, quick

30
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,174
Get the horses ready

31
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,642
Move on, quick

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,211
Hurry up

33
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,885
Come on, hurry up

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,591
Cavalry Chief

35
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:34,390
Who told you to ride out?

36
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:35,657
Your Majesty's decree

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,756
All cavaliers await at the South Gate

38
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,391
for General Niu's order

39
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:43,628
General, the surrender notes
and cavaliers are ready

40
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,832
Open the Gate

41
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:17,235
Open the Gate

42
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,071
Someone's approaching from the West

43
00:04:08,556 --> 00:04:10,421
Who are you?

44
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,126
Mozi, Ge Li

45
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:20,692
Mozi has finally arrived

46
00:04:26,774 --> 00:04:27,672
Open the Gate

47
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,075
Open the Gate

48
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:41,215
Take this

49
00:04:42,123 --> 00:04:43,681
Zhao soldiers... they're here

50
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,437
Zhao's hostile force

51
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,073
They're furious, shall we inform the King?

52
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:12,947
Who are you?

53
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:16,081
How dare you trespasses on our camp site

54
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:19,389
This is General Niu of LIANG

55
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:24,098
I'm here to deliver the surrender note

56
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,907
Send cavaliers to pass them
our surrender decision

57
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:35,909
Yes

58
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,513
Attack

59
00:05:56,264 --> 00:06:00,098
You think surrendering and not fighting

60
00:06:00,134 --> 00:06:01,965
can please the Zhao?

61
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:04,062
And stop the war?

62
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,470
Zhao's army is huge

63
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,134
you want us all to get killed?

64
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:26,288
When they take over Liang,
you'll still have to suffer

65
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:28,221
Ministers will be killed

66
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,568
soldiers will be captured

67
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,929
your families will be ruined

68
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:44,809
women will be dishonored

69
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,473
Why?

70
00:06:46,514 --> 00:06:49,244
Are you contented with this?

71
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:53,746
Why don't you give a try?

72
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:55,886
Though...

73
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:58,191
we may die in the battle

74
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,619
but at least you'd tried

75
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:03,289
and if we can make it

76
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,061
we'll make it worth

77
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,431
We can't give up our homeland

78
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,765
What shall we do then?

79
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,895
Sir, please lead us to defend

80
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:13,532
Yes, lead us

81
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,472
Take action now, Mozi

82
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:20,413
Zhao army is already here

83
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:06,221
Can you give me your bow?

84
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,921
Their distance is too far

85
00:08:07,962 --> 00:08:09,361
Give me

86
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,538
To fight or surrender?

87
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:33,251
No one is allowed to intrude into my city

88
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:58,609
Protect the General

89
00:09:08,122 --> 00:09:09,749
General Gao...

90
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:14,490
General Wei commanded us to retreat?

91
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,826
Retreat

92
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:20,094
Thank you

93
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:23,126
Good job, they'd retreated

94
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,331
They are only the vanguard troop

95
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:27,136
It's just the beginning

96
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:32,309
Retreat

97
00:09:38,219 --> 00:09:39,686
Your majesty

98
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,744
Proceed

99
00:09:41,722 --> 00:09:45,818
A Mozi arrived and
drove away the Zhao's vanguard

100
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,020
Congratulations, My Lord

101
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:50,428
Liang is saved

102
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,603
Nonsense

103
00:10:07,548 --> 00:10:09,311
My Lord, please take care

104
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:13,947
My Lord...

105
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,186
My Lord...

106
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,351
Your Honor, the King was drunk

107
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,732
Back off, the Prince is coming

108
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,738
Come on, good boy

109
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,350
The King is not feeling well

110
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:47,247
your request had to be put back later

111
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:50,922
Enemies are right outside,
we don't have much time

112
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:52,550
By the way

113
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,754
which cities have you protected before?

114
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,998
This is my first time

115
00:11:00,835 --> 00:11:02,393
You are the only one they sent?

116
00:11:03,838 --> 00:11:07,205
How about the jade pendant?

117
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,273
Did you bring it?

118
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:12,006
It's still in the Mozi Hall

119
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,543
It was our token for Mozi's help

120
00:11:16,584 --> 00:11:18,552
How can you forget?

121
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,718
Let me have a look

122
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:21,653
General Wei

123
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:23,281
why...

124
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,422
Just a little modification...

125
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:30,454
and double the shooting range

126
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,659
Why do you stop my attack?

127
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:36,602
What for?

128
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,867
We don't need to attack

129
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:42,374
Liang had already sent someone here to surrender

130
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:47,375
Then, why are they shooting me?

131
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,076
Give out my order

132
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:54,821
block off all the paths to Liang

133
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,416
poison all its water source.

134
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:01,860
No one is to go near Liang without my order

135
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,386
Yes

136
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,592
That just...

137
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:07,726
gives them time to defend

138
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:13,865
Don't worry

139
00:12:13,908 --> 00:12:16,775
we'll discuss when the Commander arrives

140
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,307
Sir, Prince Liang Shi offered...

141
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,049
you to rest here for the night

142
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:29,179
Thank you

143
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,139
Thank you

144
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,159
Cavalry Chief

145
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,665
Who did the arrangement?
He's here to protect us

146
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,642
It's the Prince's order...

147
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,144
The Prince? How can he...

148
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,792
My Prince was convinced by an outsider

149
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:43,820
and stimulated the Zhao's vanguard

150
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,492
They will definitely retaliate.

151
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,502
I'm sure your majesty understands

152
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,870
What is your suggestion?

153
00:13:55,075 --> 00:13:56,940
Your servant believes that...

154
00:13:56,977 --> 00:14:00,504
Don't hesitate? Say it.

155
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:06,512
Ge Li persuaded the people

156
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,718
and offended the Zhao against your decree

157
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:13,158
We must arrest Ge Li

158
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:15,355
and hand him over to the Zhao

159
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,695
That will placate them

160
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,224
and show My Lord's sincerity

161
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:26,103
If Xiang Yanzhong and his troops arrive

162
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,166
Liang will be in great danger

163
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:34,371
Royal Tutor wants me to...

164
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:36,747
turn against the Mozi?

165
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:38,581
My Lord

166
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:43,122
this is the only way to save Liang

167
00:14:43,157 --> 00:14:47,924
What about the Mozi?

168
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:50,055
They would be furious

169
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:55,827
Ge Li didn't bring the pendant you sent

170
00:14:56,837 --> 00:14:59,169
his identity is unclear

171
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,005
My Lord

172
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:04,408
Proceed

173
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,243
The Prince came to see
your majesty with Mozi Ge Li

174
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:14,252
Bring Ge Li to the Main Hall alone

175
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,516
Yes

176
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:28,663
Long live My Lord

177
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:44,343
Ge Li

178
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,409
Yes

179
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:49,286
I've heard that you've never lead troops

180
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,383
or protect a city before

181
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:56,690
Facing Xiang Yanzhong's force

182
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,724
how will you save Liang?

183
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:04,932
Zhao's target is Yan Nation

184
00:16:04,972 --> 00:16:09,238
they won't risk their mission on Liang

185
00:16:09,276 --> 00:16:13,337
The battle with Liang must be fast and clear

186
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,814
Survival or not

187
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,909
depends on how long Liang can hold

188
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:21,854
How long will it take to repel the Zhao?

189
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:27,953
If Liang can hold up to one month,
Zhao will retreat

190
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,666
Ge Li

191
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,059
You think...

192
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,037
how long can Liang hold?

193
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:41,974
That's up to your trust on me

194
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,500
I trust you unquestionably

195
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,807
Then, I urged you to

196
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:48,679
hand over all command to Ge Li

197
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,009
The utmost care must be taken

198
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,249
orders must be clear & strict

199
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,520
efficiency is most important

200
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:02,959
Right

201
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:08,795
Right

202
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:13,633
It seems that...

203
00:17:13,674 --> 00:17:17,906
Liang is going for a long siege

204
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:19,977
Yes

205
00:17:20,014 --> 00:17:23,177
But what if...

206
00:17:23,217 --> 00:17:28,450
...I mean if you were killed?

207
00:17:28,489 --> 00:17:31,151
What else can we do?

208
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:33,315
How about...

209
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,057
not fighting?

210
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:43,769
Not to fight?

211
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:45,328
Right

212
00:17:48,075 --> 00:17:51,340
That's all on your will

213
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,640
My will is strong for that

214
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,884
Then tie up Ge Li now

215
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,426
let Prince Liang Shi...

216
00:18:07,728 --> 00:18:09,662
bring him to the Zhao

217
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:14,027
That will stop the war

218
00:18:15,235 --> 00:18:19,001
You can bring along your families

219
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,599
go to Zhao Nation

220
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,304
and plead for forgiveness

221
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:30,082
You then hand over Liang to the Zhao

222
00:18:31,418 --> 00:18:36,856
All men will become slaves

223
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,822
Then...

224
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:42,261
the people of Liang will suffer no war

225
00:18:43,097 --> 00:18:47,056
If your majesty prefers this

226
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:50,935
Fine, Ge Li will do all he can

227
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:52,438
Please

228
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,052
The king sees his people as everything

229
00:19:44,258 --> 00:19:47,591
My decision is... at all costs

230
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:50,330
Liang Shi

231
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:53,530
Yes

232
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:59,331
You must obey Ge Li's command

233
00:19:59,373 --> 00:20:01,500
Apart from the Royal guards

234
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:05,410
Mozi Ge Li will command all troops

235
00:20:05,445 --> 00:20:08,346
to resist Zhao's invasion

236
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:13,046
Anyone who disobeys his orders will be...

237
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,678
be-headed

238
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:22,251
Our enemy will poison our water source

239
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,321
from now on

240
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:28,266
we must not use any water flowing into Liang

241
00:20:28,302 --> 00:20:32,636
We'll have to dig more wells in the city

242
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:36,837
Collect farmer's harvest

243
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:38,845
select several locations in the city

244
00:20:38,879 --> 00:20:40,540
as food storages

245
00:20:40,581 --> 00:20:43,414
All food and water will be under distribution

246
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,509
Direct all water drainage

247
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:48,487
to the farmland and let it swamp

248
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:50,649
Swamp the farmland?

249
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:52,955
We'll starve ourselves of food

250
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,518
With appropriate allocation

251
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:58,622
our coffers will last us for a year

252
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,599
Then what?

253
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,602
We'll have kept the city

254
00:21:03,537 --> 00:21:05,528
but there'll be nothing left

255
00:21:05,572 --> 00:21:09,941
If we lose our lives,
what good will come of that?

256
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,342
Even if we block off the East

257
00:21:11,378 --> 00:21:14,074
enemies will attack us from other directions

258
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,614
The west and north give us natural barriers

259
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,086
Enemies will not attack from those directions

260
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:23,282
How about the south?

261
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,813
Why don't we spend more effort on it?

262
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:28,259
Every city must have one weakness

263
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:32,732
this is where our enemies will attack

264
00:21:32,766 --> 00:21:35,132
so as to control their attack

265
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,503
Gather all the strong men

266
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:43,601
we've to build a bulwark
at the south in seven days

267
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:47,609
Can that be done?

268
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,637
Mr. Ge Li

269
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,048
how can we build a bulwark in such a short time?

270
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,608
It would take at least a year

271
00:21:52,653 --> 00:21:55,349
to bring the stones from the mountain

272
00:21:55,389 --> 00:21:58,358
Knocking down the palace wall?

273
00:21:59,393 --> 00:22:01,623
How can you protect the palace?

274
00:22:01,662 --> 00:22:03,186
Are you revolting?

275
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,867
These stones are for building a bulwark

276
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:14,267
The bulwark

277
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:18,276
is our first line of defense

278
00:22:19,146 --> 00:22:21,114
If we lose the city

279
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,776
the palace will be lost too

280
00:22:23,817 --> 00:22:27,651
Protecting the city means protecting the palace

281
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:30,020
Ge Li

282
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:33,584
can a bulwark built in such a short tim

283
00:22:33,627 --> 00:22:37,028
defend Xiang Yanzhong's troop?

284
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,329
To defend Liang in such a way...

285
00:22:40,367 --> 00:22:42,494
This is not only defending

286
00:22:42,536 --> 00:22:47,337
it's also a psychological tactic

287
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,837
The bulwark has to be built precisely

288
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,144
matching with the main wall

289
00:22:56,183 --> 00:22:58,583
The efficiency of the Liang people

290
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:02,247
will definitely threaten our enemies

291
00:23:07,828 --> 00:23:10,092
Your highness

292
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,963
please allow cavalry to
help with moving the stones

293
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,933
to speed up the process

294
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:18,265
Cavalry troops represent
the superiority of Liang

295
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:21,638
how can they be used to move stones?

296
00:23:25,178 --> 00:23:26,406
I believe that...

297
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,539
this may prove My Lord's love

298
00:23:28,582 --> 00:23:31,050
and care for his people

299
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:32,881
Right

300
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,689
With their help, seven days will be enough

301
00:23:55,342 --> 00:23:57,606
Unload and move on quickly

302
00:23:58,678 --> 00:23:59,736
The sun rises in this direction

303
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,647
Sunlight will be the strongest after 3 hours

304
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,883
Move back

305
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,190
There's drinking water outside the Gate

306
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,062
Go by the side

307
00:24:25,105 --> 00:24:27,505
Move on quickly

308
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,275
Record the landscape

309
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:32,471
Yes

310
00:24:32,979 --> 00:24:35,846
Let's go the stream

311
00:24:35,882 --> 00:24:37,179
Go

312
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:11,211
What a disgrace, never-ending warfare

313
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,151
There's war everywhere

314
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:16,451
I don't want to run anymore

315
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,617
You want to die here?

316
00:25:18,658 --> 00:25:20,990
That Mozi looks quite capable

317
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:23,052
maybe Liang can hold

318
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,690
Why don't we just give them the city?

319
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,166
Who cares who we pay tax to?

320
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:29,327
Quiet...

321
00:25:30,837 --> 00:25:32,668
Quick, unload these alcohols

322
00:25:32,706 --> 00:25:34,173
Yes...

323
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,768
Cai Qiu...

324
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:18,083
Don't go

325
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:21,382
Come back

326
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:55,654
Just let the baby cry...

327
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,090
Be quiet

328
00:26:58,124 --> 00:26:59,421
What is it?

329
00:26:59,459 --> 00:27:01,256
Zhao troops arrived

330
00:27:01,294 --> 00:27:03,057
Don't let the baby cry

331
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:04,085
Keep quiet

332
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:04,960
Don't let her cry

333
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,693
- Let me hug her
- Give her to me

334
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,291
Don't hurt the child

335
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,166
Stop the crying

336
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:12,433
Let me hug her

337
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:15,803
Don't let the baby cry

338
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,811
Give her to me

339
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,712
Give her the child

340
00:27:21,748 --> 00:27:23,682
Stop her crying and keep quiet

341
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:24,706
sister...

342
00:27:24,751 --> 00:27:26,685
My child

343
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,278
My child

344
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:29,515
Shut up

345
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:31,023
We are all going to die

346
00:27:31,057 --> 00:27:32,581
Stop crying

347
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,763
You flee because you don't want to fight

348
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:46,902
we're also tired of killing

349
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:49,572
We're heading to Yan Nation

350
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:52,442
and just bypassing Liang for supplies

351
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:55,107
How come Liang confused our purpose?

352
00:27:55,782 --> 00:27:58,307
Is there someone persuading you?

353
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:01,818
A Mozi came...

354
00:28:02,422 --> 00:28:03,787
his name is Geli...

355
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:05,188
Only one?

356
00:28:06,326 --> 00:28:10,820
4,000 people persuaded by one person

357
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:13,731
to fight against 100,000 soldiers?

358
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:16,491
We dare not

359
00:28:19,205 --> 00:28:23,039
Leaders must earn their respect

360
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:27,204
Zi Tuan, you'll lead the archers

361
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:30,211
Will you take the command?

362
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:34,544
Why don't you take Ge Li's order?

363
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,318
How dare you

364
00:28:38,358 --> 00:28:41,327
Your skill and experience is not up to mine

365
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,852
how can you be the leader?

366
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:45,956
You're not qualified and hiding the truth

367
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:47,928
Guards

368
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,598
Take him

369
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:51,069
No

370
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,366
Stop

371
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:01,275
Not up to the Prince's skill
will had to be imprisoned

372
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:03,942
I should be taken too

373
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:10,279
Leaders must earn their respect

374
00:29:10,323 --> 00:29:12,223
Zi Tuan is not qualified

375
00:29:12,258 --> 00:29:13,782
Zi Tuan's archery

376
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,988
had amazed me on the day I arrive Liang

377
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,988
Warfare is a matter of
strategies and cooperation

378
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:23,434
no single man can ever hold off an army

379
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,960
Right

380
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:29,804
For military tactics

381
00:29:29,843 --> 00:29:35,179
we can only judge
when the enemy is at our doorstep

382
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:40,551
But for archery, let's settle it right now

383
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:50,595
the top of that pole is the target

384
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,894
you each have five shots

385
00:29:52,932 --> 00:29:55,093
You start first

386
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,675
Quit now and I can spare your life

387
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,217
Please start

388
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,284
Even if you made it, you'll never beat me

389
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:55,487
You lose

390
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:57,587
Guards, take him

391
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,766
Wait

392
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:35,263
You're the best archer

393
00:31:35,301 --> 00:31:37,633
best rider, and best fighter

394
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:41,264
all because you're the Prince of Liang

395
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:44,071
You should widen your scope

396
00:31:44,811 --> 00:31:48,076
the world is bigger than you think

397
00:31:52,986 --> 00:31:54,453
What's going on?

398
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:56,318
They're beating up those who tried to escape

399
00:31:59,425 --> 00:32:01,689
I dare not run again

400
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:11,495
Please stop, please

401
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,704
Do you remember the location of Zhao camp?

402
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,775
We don't know

403
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,485
When we saw the Zhao's sentry

404
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:32,047
we just turn and run

405
00:32:35,528 --> 00:32:37,826
Sir, Zhao's Commander Xiang Yanzhong

406
00:32:37,864 --> 00:32:39,798
wants to meet with you at the South Gate

407
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,894
War on a board game?

408
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:18,199
So we know where we stand

409
00:33:18,237 --> 00:33:19,363
Please

410
00:33:24,177 --> 00:33:25,075
Please

411
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,235
Commander

412
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:01,371
Just to check you out

413
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,382
you certainly are a fine catch

414
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:09,179
Small defeat means nothing,
it's just a board game

415
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,756
It isn't worth

416
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:17,354
wasting Commander's time on Liang

417
00:34:17,397 --> 00:34:18,694
right?

418
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,764
It won't cost much

419
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,566
I'm not done yet

420
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,139
Neither am I

421
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,012
See you in the battlefield

422
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,258
General

423
00:34:49,195 --> 00:34:50,560
Thank you, My Lord

424
00:34:56,269 --> 00:35:01,502
I'd changed my words in surrendering

425
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:05,568
and I'd hand over all commands to Ge Li

426
00:35:05,611 --> 00:35:08,205
General, I hope you won't take offence...

427
00:35:08,247 --> 00:35:09,646
My Lord, I really don't mind

428
00:35:11,684 --> 00:35:13,311
General...

429
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,910
Your servant is loyal to your majesty

430
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:17,923
I'm always at your command

431
00:35:20,726 --> 00:35:23,024
I appreciate your generalship

432
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,198
and your understanding

433
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:34,363
General Niu, you're always my great General

434
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,342
This battle is critical for Liang

435
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:42,637
If we can defend Zhao's first attack

436
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,912
Liang will have hope

437
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:46,717
Any questions?

438
00:35:46,752 --> 00:35:48,117
No

439
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:49,121
We'll get everything ready

440
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,180
So, dismiss and prepare for the battle

441
00:35:51,224 --> 00:35:52,486
Yes

442
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,520
Sir...

443
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:58,962
Mr. Ge Li...

444
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:00,855
What is it?

445
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,959
Cavalry troop is not yet assigned with any work

446
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:06,128
Cavalry troops belong to the royal guards

447
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:07,605
I've no rights to command

448
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,005
Don't argue anymore

449
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,435
Usually...

450
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:17,977
People flee from war

451
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:22,051
do you really know what war is?

452
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:24,113
This is my homeland

453
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:26,717
When my father was still alive

454
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:28,852
he was always on the front line

455
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,419
I don't want to be despised

456
00:36:30,463 --> 00:36:32,988
just because I'm a girl...

457
00:36:37,803 --> 00:36:39,930
There's one very important job...

458
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,240
You're responsible for the square

459
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:52,183
Collect them to the City East for distribution

460
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:55,210
We don't have much time, the rest come with me

461
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,380
Yes

462
00:37:02,895 --> 00:37:04,988
Wake up, everybody

463
00:37:05,031 --> 00:37:07,226
By the command of Mr. Ge Li

464
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,394
give us all your excrement now

465
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,427
give us all your excrement

466
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:13,904
I can't take this anymore

467
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:17,402
I'm really cracked up

468
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,213
The Zhaos...

469
00:37:22,248 --> 00:37:25,877
when will they attack?

470
00:37:31,724 --> 00:37:34,625
Are they... waiting for us?

471
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,367
That's impossible

472
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:49,806
Ge Li is no dummy...

473
00:37:49,842 --> 00:37:51,207
We've to think it through

474
00:37:51,244 --> 00:37:52,973
We can't wait anymore

475
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:55,412
They'll really kill them all

476
00:37:57,583 --> 00:38:01,451
Don't you know our wives
and kids will all be dead?

477
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,148
Quiet

478
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:06,056
We're here all because of your wife...

479
00:38:06,092 --> 00:38:07,684
Forget it... it's over already...

480
00:38:07,727 --> 00:38:09,388
it's over

481
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:19,395
...I killed my own child, he is still in...

482
00:38:19,438 --> 00:38:20,666
It's over already

483
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,338
Everybody get up

484
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,768
and follow me out

485
00:38:25,811 --> 00:38:26,971
What's going on here?

486
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,947
- What is it?
- Get up! Quick

487
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,273
Keep quiet

488
00:38:31,317 --> 00:38:32,375
Quiet

489
00:38:32,418 --> 00:38:33,851
What's going on here?

490
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:36,616
You... shut up

491
00:38:36,656 --> 00:38:39,022
For no matter what reasons you're here

492
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:41,026
from now on

493
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:44,627
no one will care

494
00:38:44,997 --> 00:38:47,329
You'll be sent to the front line of the battle

495
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,926
to fight against your enemies

496
00:38:50,569 --> 00:38:51,729
Defeat your enemies

497
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,062
and you'll be freed

498
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,437
We're innocent

499
00:38:55,474 --> 00:38:57,203
why do we have to give our lives?

500
00:38:57,243 --> 00:39:00,940
Who are not victims in a war?
Answer me

501
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:10,244
Your anger and rages

502
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:12,587
your freedom...

503
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:14,957
is in your hands now

504
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:16,928
Fight for yourselves

505
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:19,294
and the innocents

506
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,598
Freedom is more valued only if

507
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,502
you defeat your enemies, understand?

508
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:32,672
Set

509
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:37,480
Shoot

510
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:41,752
Alignment

511
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:44,080
Shoot

512
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,826
Hurry up, pass around the arrows

513
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:14,946
Look

514
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:16,818
The excrement really works

515
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:18,483
it puts out the fire

516
00:40:18,524 --> 00:40:20,890
Spread more on the other roof tops

517
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:46,345
Front attack

518
00:40:53,592 --> 00:40:58,325
Invade South Gate

519
00:40:58,364 --> 00:41:00,730
Invade South Gate

520
00:41:57,823 --> 00:42:00,155
Everybody get up and fight

521
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:10,234
Pour the sulphur

522
00:42:44,203 --> 00:42:45,192
Shoot

523
00:43:00,686 --> 00:43:02,176
Give me the stone

524
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:07,821
Pass it along to the wall

525
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,690
Yes

526
00:43:08,827 --> 00:43:10,988
Hurry up

527
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:17,666
Move

528
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,070
Come with me

529
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,832
I'm not, not me

530
00:43:56,275 --> 00:43:58,573
My Prince, there are Zhao spies in the town

531
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,778
Dong

532
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,467
Go

533
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:19,017
You shouldn't be here...

534
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,591
You shouldn't...

535
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:26,523
Get back inside the Gate

536
00:46:06,538 --> 00:46:07,664
Shoot

537
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:43,367
Bulwark had been taken, two units are moving in

538
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:46,206
South gate was opened, we are moving in

539
00:46:51,116 --> 00:46:52,242
You stay behind

540
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:53,444
Yes

541
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,931
Raise the drawbridge

542
00:47:07,966 --> 00:47:09,297
Hurry up

543
00:47:16,108 --> 00:47:17,302
Pull it

544
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,218
The drawbridge got stuck

545
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,743
we can't get out and rescue Ge Li

546
00:48:10,062 --> 00:48:11,222
Attack

547
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,023
Three units are approaching

548
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,068
Focus the attack in the Bulwark

549
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,933
Cover Ge Li. Go

550
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,358
Shoot! Just shoot

551
00:49:19,398 --> 00:49:20,456
Draw back

552
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:31,106
Ge Li

553
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:33,642
- Shoot him
- Pull

554
00:49:49,094 --> 00:49:50,686
Close the gate

555
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:52,026
Remove the bodies, quick

556
00:49:52,064 --> 00:49:53,190
Close the gate

557
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:54,198
Hurry up

558
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:55,961
Close the gate

559
00:50:06,812 --> 00:50:08,837
Tear down Liang

560
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,632
Protect Commander

561
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:38,975
Close the gate

562
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,673
Stop crying

563
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,569
Close the Gate

564
00:50:42,614 --> 00:50:44,013
Quick

565
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:45,106
Move back

566
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,141
What sound is that? Quiet

567
00:50:47,185 --> 00:50:47,776
Come with me

568
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,116
Quiet

569
00:50:49,154 --> 00:50:50,781
Zhao's retreating drum sound

570
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:52,449
- Zhao is retreating
- Really?

571
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:55,153
They're retreating, we've made it

572
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:59,186
The Zhao's retreating

573
00:52:10,702 --> 00:52:11,828
Stay in bed

574
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:13,633
tend to your wounds

575
00:52:14,306 --> 00:52:15,432
I'm fine

576
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:19,844
Where am I?

577
00:52:21,913 --> 00:52:23,540
Dong's room

578
00:52:24,816 --> 00:52:26,306
I'm sorry

579
00:52:27,752 --> 00:52:29,447
He can finally relieve...

580
00:52:30,055 --> 00:52:31,955
only that he cannot die in peace...

581
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:43,631
Brand new

582
00:52:44,636 --> 00:52:48,094
It's okay, I'm fine with what I have

583
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:50,301
It isn't worth much

584
00:52:50,342 --> 00:52:52,003
please keep it

585
00:52:53,311 --> 00:52:58,305
Mozi shouldn't accept gifts

586
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,977
or else

587
00:53:00,018 --> 00:53:04,250
people will think we are
helping others for their return

588
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:05,916
Not accepting gifts

589
00:53:05,957 --> 00:53:08,517
doesn't mean no one suspect you

590
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:22,431
Wait...

591
00:53:24,476 --> 00:53:26,068
You'd better stay in here

592
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:27,601
there're lots of people outside

593
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,442
Mr. Ge Li has recovered

594
00:53:42,861 --> 00:53:47,093
Commander, we can't postpone attacking Yan

595
00:53:47,132 --> 00:53:48,861
My suggestion is...

596
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,733
Let's leave 4,000 soldiers guarding Liang

597
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,433
they'll surrender when they
run out of food and water

598
00:53:55,473 --> 00:53:56,701
then...

599
00:53:56,741 --> 00:53:59,904
we can then take revenge for General Gao

600
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,413
Commander, what do you think?

601
00:54:04,049 --> 00:54:07,041
This battle is no longer a personal affair

602
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:09,815
Liang seems meaningless to us, but...

603
00:54:09,854 --> 00:54:12,322
we under-estimated our enemies,
and were defeated

604
00:54:13,558 --> 00:54:15,287
You think...

605
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:18,888
we can defeat Yan with our dispirited troops?

606
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,023
Do we have this courage?

607
00:54:23,368 --> 00:54:27,532
I would like to have
opinions from other Generals

608
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:09,680
This dagger has poison

609
00:55:09,714 --> 00:55:11,909
someone dropped it into my house

610
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:14,111
They're already here...

611
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:16,245
even if we don't do it...

612
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:20,186
they'll do it

613
00:55:30,235 --> 00:55:33,898
You don't want to kill Ge Li, right?

614
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,504
You must have forgotten your wife and son...

615
00:55:38,576 --> 00:55:39,941
No

616
00:55:39,978 --> 00:55:42,606
he came here to protect us

617
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:44,512
How can we do that?

618
00:55:46,685 --> 00:55:47,947
Protect us?

619
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:49,715
He is giving up our lives

620
00:55:49,754 --> 00:55:51,722
by putting us in the front line?

621
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:55,214
We're just lucky to be still alive

622
00:55:56,294 --> 00:55:59,058
Even if we'd killed Ge Li...

623
00:55:59,097 --> 00:56:01,861
can we save our families?

624
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,425
If we kill Ge Li...

625
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:06,937
who's going to save Liang?

626
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:13,037
I know where he is...

627
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:26,917
Take it

628
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:28,084
Go

629
00:56:28,126 --> 00:56:29,252
Go

630
00:56:34,632 --> 00:56:36,099
Everybody listen

631
00:56:36,134 --> 00:56:37,567
no matter what, armor or swords

632
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:40,469
collect all the useful stuffs

633
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,574
What are you doing?

634
00:56:51,216 --> 00:56:53,377
Why do you want to kill me?

635
00:56:53,418 --> 00:56:54,043
Drop the knife

636
00:56:54,085 --> 00:56:55,814
Stay away

637
00:56:55,854 --> 00:56:58,345
Guards

638
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:02,291
Drop the weapon

639
00:57:11,603 --> 00:57:13,730
Mr. Ge Li, he's dead

640
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:27,550
I've one important announcement today

641
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:29,450
But before I announce

642
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,512
let's give a...

643
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:34,184
silent meditation to Pu Le, who died yesterday

644
00:57:36,394 --> 00:57:38,453
As usual

645
00:57:39,431 --> 00:57:40,830
close your eyes

646
00:57:40,865 --> 00:57:42,924
until the 10th stroke

647
00:57:55,713 --> 00:57:56,975
Traitor

648
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:06,813
Little girl...

649
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,120
don't be afraid

650
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,852
why do you have to come to Liang?

651
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:17,593
It must be the Zhao
assigned her to kill Mr. Ge Li

652
00:58:17,635 --> 00:58:19,694
Right, why do you want to kill Mr. Ge Li

653
00:58:19,737 --> 00:58:21,102
Quiet

654
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,604
Bastard, how dare you are

655
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:29,773
Don't let her go! Kill her

656
00:58:29,814 --> 00:58:30,906
Stop

657
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:32,483
Back off

658
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:34,278
Back off

659
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:31,841
Mr. Ge Li

660
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:34,534
Where are you going?

661
00:59:37,715 --> 00:59:39,342
I'd like to make myself clear

662
00:59:40,752 --> 00:59:44,210
Mozi will not accept any gifts

663
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:47,515
Thanks for your gesture

664
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:31,129
Sir

665
01:00:31,163 --> 01:00:32,926
Why do you follow me?

666
01:00:32,965 --> 01:00:35,195
You nearly got killed! Go back

667
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,067
Aren't you going to spy on Zhao Camp?

668
01:00:39,104 --> 01:00:40,799
I always came here riding with the horses

669
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,568
I'm familiar with this area

670
01:00:43,108 --> 01:00:44,473
Follow me

671
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:47,836
You're not going

672
01:00:48,647 --> 01:00:50,239
This way is the shortcut

673
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:00,220
What are they carrying?

674
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:01,749
Soil

675
01:01:01,794 --> 01:01:03,921
They're digging a tunnel...

676
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:08,189
To Liang?

677
01:01:17,142 --> 01:01:18,939
Why are they dumping it into the stream?

678
01:01:18,977 --> 01:01:22,413
The stream will wash away the soil

679
01:01:24,116 --> 01:01:26,243
then, no one will know

680
01:01:26,285 --> 01:01:30,051
how far they had dug

681
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:31,716
Let's go

682
01:01:32,725 --> 01:01:34,090
Someone is up there

683
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:48,033
There they are

684
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:49,438
Get them

685
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,224
Can you swim?

686
01:02:10,496 --> 01:02:12,259
Go, don't worry about me

687
01:02:12,297 --> 01:02:13,457
Go, quick

688
01:02:18,637 --> 01:02:19,626
Stop running

689
01:02:19,671 --> 01:02:21,866
Surrender or you'll die here

690
01:02:21,907 --> 01:02:22,839
You'll have to save me

691
01:02:24,843 --> 01:02:26,174
Move

692
01:03:13,992 --> 01:03:14,959
Breathe

693
01:03:16,762 --> 01:03:18,457
You're...

694
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:20,124
very brave

695
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:23,995
If I didn't jump...

696
01:03:25,137 --> 01:03:26,695
would you jump?

697
01:03:26,738 --> 01:03:28,262
I would

698
01:03:28,307 --> 01:03:30,332
But I'll kill you first

699
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,604
Is that what you Mozi would have done sanely?

700
01:03:35,314 --> 01:03:37,805
You think killing you is rational?

701
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,545
How are you going to kill me?

702
01:03:44,189 --> 01:03:45,918
Push you down the waterfall

703
01:03:49,461 --> 01:03:51,190
Do you feel better now?

704
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,027
Can you walk by yourself?

705
01:04:04,309 --> 01:04:06,106
Quiet

706
01:04:12,317 --> 01:04:14,046
There's nothing in the West City and the barn

707
01:04:14,086 --> 01:04:16,020
where are they going to attack?

708
01:04:16,788 --> 01:04:19,916
They'll dig a few tunnels,
there'll be more than one exit

709
01:04:19,958 --> 01:04:23,223
we can't be sure whether we had blocked them all

710
01:04:24,963 --> 01:04:27,090
I'm not blocking them off

711
01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:28,531
I'm letting them in

712
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:29,727
No

713
01:04:29,768 --> 01:04:32,862
they must be collaborating
with the force outside

714
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,670
I know

715
01:04:35,707 --> 01:04:38,835
we're going to defeat our enemies in a dragnet

716
01:04:39,478 --> 01:04:40,706
After ten days

717
01:04:40,746 --> 01:04:45,376
we can dig three tunnels in here, here and here

718
01:04:45,417 --> 01:04:46,577
Commander, what do you think?

719
01:04:46,618 --> 01:04:48,711
Can you speed up the process?

720
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:52,212
If our soldiers can enter the City

721
01:04:52,257 --> 01:04:54,521
Liang will not be able to defend

722
01:04:56,428 --> 01:04:58,589
Three days later

723
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:00,791
will be the advent of winter

724
01:05:00,832 --> 01:05:03,824
Longer night time is an advantage for our attack

725
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:04,836
Commander

726
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:09,398
Someone was spying on us a few days ago...

727
01:05:09,441 --> 01:05:11,932
The longer we take

728
01:05:11,977 --> 01:05:15,811
our enemies may find out the tunnel exits

729
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:17,940
Gather all the slaves

730
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:21,817
three days later

731
01:05:21,853 --> 01:05:24,617
we'll attack from here

732
01:06:26,551 --> 01:06:28,246
Warriors, get ready

733
01:06:46,671 --> 01:06:48,536
Commander...

734
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:09,084
The exit was blocked, move back

735
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:14,727
Attack

736
01:07:16,334 --> 01:07:17,995
Pull

737
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:43,758
Drop your weapons

738
01:07:43,795 --> 01:07:45,524
and your lives will be spared

739
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:06,510
They're here

740
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,914
I'm just a slave

741
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,424
I don't want to come

742
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:14,152
Stop him

743
01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:15,557
let me go

744
01:08:16,428 --> 01:08:17,588
Kill him

745
01:08:17,629 --> 01:08:19,028
What are you doing? Please let her down

746
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:22,496
Stay back

747
01:08:22,534 --> 01:08:26,231
Please... please, let her go...

748
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,634
Please... please, let her go...

749
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:34,412
Please... don't...

750
01:08:34,446 --> 01:08:36,243
he'll really kill my sister

751
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:38,010
The Zhao force me

752
01:08:38,049 --> 01:08:39,209
I don't want to come

753
01:08:39,251 --> 01:08:40,240
Please, please...

754
01:08:40,285 --> 01:08:41,684
Please give her back to me

755
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:45,747
Please let her down

756
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:46,654
Stay back

757
01:08:46,691 --> 01:08:48,556
No please

758
01:08:50,061 --> 01:08:51,619
Let her go...

759
01:08:51,663 --> 01:08:53,858
let the child go

760
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:54,866
She's innocent

761
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,368
I just know how to dig tunnels

762
01:08:57,402 --> 01:08:59,336
they force me to come

763
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:02,329
Get ready

764
01:09:02,941 --> 01:09:04,272
Kill

765
01:09:05,677 --> 01:09:06,905
Shoot

766
01:09:15,554 --> 01:09:17,488
Defeating enemies in a dragnet

767
01:09:28,366 --> 01:09:29,628
Quiet

768
01:09:29,668 --> 01:09:31,135
Xiao Xiao, it's okay

769
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:33,833
Let go of the child

770
01:09:34,606 --> 01:09:36,631
I promise

771
01:09:36,675 --> 01:09:38,870
no one will hurt you

772
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,447
Give her to me

773
01:09:43,481 --> 01:09:45,506
Please...

774
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:47,279
Give me

775
01:09:55,694 --> 01:09:56,490
Xiao-xiao...

776
01:09:56,528 --> 01:09:58,689
Xiao-xiao...

777
01:10:01,967 --> 01:10:03,059
Stop

778
01:10:03,835 --> 01:10:04,494
Let him go

779
01:10:05,103 --> 01:10:06,092
Stop

780
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:08,735
Stop

781
01:10:09,908 --> 01:10:10,875
Stop

782
01:10:12,143 --> 01:10:13,269
Stop

783
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:17,207
Move back

784
01:10:17,916 --> 01:10:18,974
Move back

785
01:10:19,017 --> 01:10:19,984
Everybody back

786
01:10:20,018 --> 01:10:21,280
Everybody move back

787
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:22,115
Sir, are you alright?

788
01:10:22,153 --> 01:10:23,211
I'm fine

789
01:10:23,255 --> 01:10:24,779
All of you assemble at the Square

790
01:10:24,823 --> 01:10:26,757
Hurry Up! Go

791
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:29,157
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

792
01:11:07,499 --> 01:11:09,126
Let's go back

793
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,864
Don't come back

794
01:11:17,842 --> 01:11:21,710
Go along the stream, you'll not be found

795
01:11:26,885 --> 01:11:29,217
Why don't you kill me?

796
01:11:34,959 --> 01:11:37,689
Why do you ask such a foolish question?

797
01:11:40,865 --> 01:11:42,924
Why...

798
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:45,060
should people kill each other?

799
01:11:57,015 --> 01:11:59,813
I must take revenge for you

800
01:12:01,453 --> 01:12:04,217
It's all my fault

801
01:12:04,255 --> 01:12:08,157
I shouldn't make you suffer

802
01:12:08,193 --> 01:12:10,787
They're inhuman

803
01:12:35,553 --> 01:12:37,145
Congratulations on your astounding victory

804
01:12:37,188 --> 01:12:38,815
The King would like to reward you

805
01:12:40,358 --> 01:12:42,053
Please come with me to the Palace

806
01:12:45,397 --> 01:12:46,989
Reward?

807
01:12:49,267 --> 01:12:51,497
General Niu...

808
01:12:51,536 --> 01:12:54,994
can't you see all these dead bodies?

809
01:12:55,573 --> 01:12:57,006
They were our enemies

810
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:59,066
Aren't they humans?

811
01:13:00,178 --> 01:13:04,808
When enemies is trying to kill me

812
01:13:04,849 --> 01:13:08,410
I'll have to defend or even kill him

813
01:13:09,187 --> 01:13:12,088
but killing someone because of hatred...

814
01:13:12,123 --> 01:13:14,057
it's absolutely wrong

815
01:13:15,093 --> 01:13:16,856
What a pity

816
01:13:17,362 --> 01:13:21,162
Every man has his weak point

817
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,863
Mozi Philosophy is not for ruling a country

818
01:13:26,604 --> 01:13:32,065
This Mozi clan will fall...

819
01:13:37,115 --> 01:13:38,912
I'd like to be excused

820
01:13:39,684 --> 01:13:43,484
You seem very appreciative of Ge Li

821
01:13:45,857 --> 01:13:48,155
I acknowledge his defending skills

822
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:51,754
That's where it should end

823
01:13:51,796 --> 01:13:58,031
Mozi philosophy is only
applicable in times of war

824
01:13:58,069 --> 01:14:03,097
They're not suitable in times of peace

825
01:14:03,141 --> 01:14:05,939
You must be clear on this

826
01:14:05,977 --> 01:14:09,413
Yes, my Lord is right

827
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:10,937
Understood

828
01:14:19,891 --> 01:14:21,722
Watch him closely

829
01:14:21,759 --> 01:14:22,316
Yes

830
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:24,590
don't let him getting off the track

831
01:14:24,629 --> 01:14:26,119
Yes

832
01:14:26,164 --> 01:14:27,961
General Niu

833
01:14:27,999 --> 01:14:28,761
Yes

834
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,825
you must pay close attention

835
01:14:30,869 --> 01:14:34,862
all those revolting thoughts

836
01:14:34,906 --> 01:14:37,397
shall never spread in Liang

837
01:14:37,442 --> 01:14:38,409
Yes

838
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:56,386
Are you okay?

839
01:15:00,131 --> 01:15:01,598
I'm fine

840
01:15:04,769 --> 01:15:06,498
The weather is getting cold...

841
01:15:06,538 --> 01:15:08,028
I know you don't have any warm clothing...

842
01:15:08,072 --> 01:15:11,633
so I took out my father's coat
and see if it fits or not

843
01:15:11,676 --> 01:15:14,201
I can adjust it...

844
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:17,808
Just fit, thanks

845
01:15:19,817 --> 01:15:22,342
I'll return it when I leave

846
01:15:23,755 --> 01:15:25,746
When?

847
01:15:26,524 --> 01:15:28,958
I'll leave when this battle is over

848
01:15:31,062 --> 01:15:32,962
The battle should be over soon...

849
01:15:33,565 --> 01:15:34,827
very soon

850
01:15:45,577 --> 01:15:48,273
Did you go to the Square last night?

851
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:50,938
No

852
01:15:50,982 --> 01:15:54,440
You assigned me to keep guard in the North

853
01:15:54,485 --> 01:15:56,749
I'd heard the Zhao army was defeated

854
01:15:56,788 --> 01:15:58,847
Many of them died...

855
01:16:01,859 --> 01:16:04,157
lots of them

856
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:08,792
They're still...

857
01:16:09,534 --> 01:16:12,526
moving their bodies out for burial

858
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:18,141
Defeating enemies
in a dragnet... is that right?

859
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,127
I remembered

860
01:16:40,164 --> 01:16:43,622
my father told me this
when I was a little girl...

861
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:50,538
When you start questioning
what is right or wrong

862
01:16:50,575 --> 01:16:53,601
you are uncertain with your faith and beliefs

863
01:17:06,924 --> 01:17:09,859
Is it only war can make you stay?

864
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:17,065
I thought...

865
01:17:17,101 --> 01:17:19,626
you are always looking for peace

866
01:17:33,251 --> 01:17:34,775
Sorry...

867
01:17:37,321 --> 01:17:39,346
What for?

868
01:17:53,738 --> 01:17:55,968
You're always like that...

869
01:17:58,076 --> 01:18:01,512
You're so protective with everything you do

870
01:18:02,613 --> 01:18:05,480
You always ask whether you're right or not

871
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:10,747
Is it really that important?

872
01:18:11,656 --> 01:18:13,556
Even if you know it's right

873
01:18:13,591 --> 01:18:16,685
but for some people...

874
01:18:16,728 --> 01:18:19,026
they prefers to be wrong

875
01:18:21,866 --> 01:18:24,027
I would want to tell you

876
01:18:25,236 --> 01:18:27,500
no matter it's right or wrong

877
01:18:28,906 --> 01:18:31,397
I just want to be with you

878
01:18:38,049 --> 01:18:41,883
You talk about universal love all the time

879
01:18:44,856 --> 01:18:46,790
You should know how to love

880
01:18:47,725 --> 01:18:49,249
you know

881
01:18:58,636 --> 01:18:59,933
Ge Li arrives...

882
01:18:59,971 --> 01:19:01,563
Liang will survive

883
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,335
Ge Li stays...

884
01:19:03,374 --> 01:19:05,274
Liang will be safe

885
01:19:05,309 --> 01:19:06,606
Ge Li goes...

886
01:19:06,644 --> 01:19:08,737
Liang cannot hold

887
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,714
How about if Ge Li leaves?

888
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:21,691
Just those small pieces?

889
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:25,055
Anyway, melt it quickly

890
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:35,530
Commander

891
01:19:44,282 --> 01:19:46,113
It is time to retreat

892
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:54,618
News from our spy who returned from Zhao Nation

893
01:19:54,659 --> 01:19:56,126
Proceed

894
01:19:56,661 --> 01:19:58,356
News from Zhao Nation

895
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:00,057
The King of Qi has ordered an army of 200,000

896
01:20:00,097 --> 01:20:02,065
setting off five days ago to attack Zhao Nation

897
01:20:02,099 --> 01:20:04,329
Zhao Nation is preparing for the war

898
01:20:05,503 --> 01:20:07,266
Thanks for your majesty's blessing

899
01:20:07,305 --> 01:20:08,670
If that is the case

900
01:20:08,706 --> 01:20:11,539
Xiang Yanzhong will be called back

901
01:20:11,576 --> 01:20:13,635
Liang will be saved

902
01:20:13,678 --> 01:20:15,942
Liang will be saved

903
01:20:17,114 --> 01:20:22,017
However, the news of
Zhao's retreat must not spread

904
01:20:22,053 --> 01:20:23,418
I plead My Lord

905
01:20:23,454 --> 01:20:27,857
to withdraw all power from Ge Li immediately

906
01:20:27,892 --> 01:20:29,382
otherwise, people will think it is Ge Li

907
01:20:29,427 --> 01:20:32,760
who defeated the Zhao troops

908
01:20:32,797 --> 01:20:35,391
We have to demolish any chance

909
01:20:35,433 --> 01:20:41,065
for Ge Li's supporters to rebel

910
01:20:41,906 --> 01:20:46,275
You think Ge Li will rebel, General?

911
01:20:47,445 --> 01:20:49,276
I don't think so

912
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:51,076
Why are you so sure?

913
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:51,774
Because...

914
01:20:51,816 --> 01:20:54,046
Because there is no such need

915
01:20:54,952 --> 01:20:58,752
Ge Li's popularity

916
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:00,757
is now higher than the King

917
01:21:01,626 --> 01:21:03,890
he doesn't need to do a thing

918
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:06,091
Right?

919
01:21:11,102 --> 01:21:16,540
Someone defending Liang under false pretenses

920
01:21:17,275 --> 01:21:23,703
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

921
01:21:23,748 --> 01:21:26,376
Doesn't it sound the same as rebel?

922
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:28,817
General, what do you think?

923
01:21:30,621 --> 01:21:35,115
I agree with Royal Tutor but lack of evidence

924
01:21:35,927 --> 01:21:36,859
General Niu

925
01:21:36,894 --> 01:21:37,690
Yes

926
01:21:37,728 --> 01:21:39,195
if you restores your military power

927
01:21:39,864 --> 01:21:44,358
would you be able to put down the riot?

928
01:21:45,503 --> 01:21:48,597
And arrest all the rebels?

929
01:22:40,458 --> 01:22:42,016
They're back

930
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,559
How's it?

931
01:22:56,374 --> 01:22:57,534
Commander

932
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:03,843
Liang must think that we had retreated

933
01:23:03,881 --> 01:23:08,113
We're just left with 1,000 soldiers

934
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,414
Commander

935
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:14,114
shall we call back part of
our army for the attack?

936
01:23:15,092 --> 01:23:17,219
Victory will come

937
01:23:17,995 --> 01:23:20,327
when there's no way to retreat

938
01:23:20,998 --> 01:23:23,899
This battle has to be fast and clear

939
01:23:23,934 --> 01:23:26,494
We'll end this up with Ge Li

940
01:24:02,273 --> 01:24:03,934
New boots?

941
01:24:16,353 --> 01:24:17,877
No problem, Mr. Ge Li

942
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:20,152
it will be ready when you come back

943
01:24:21,992 --> 01:24:25,519
I disagreed on the massacre last night, but...

944
01:24:25,563 --> 01:24:27,724
You can't stop them...

945
01:24:29,834 --> 01:24:32,132
I always think that killing enemies
is a kind of glory...

946
01:24:34,772 --> 01:24:36,899
where will you go after the battle ends?

947
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:42,602
Wherever needs me, I'll be there

948
01:24:47,551 --> 01:24:51,681
What if Zhao is being
invaded and ask for your help

949
01:24:51,722 --> 01:24:53,383
will you go?

950
01:24:53,424 --> 01:24:55,051
Of course I would

951
01:24:56,627 --> 01:24:58,686
You've wiped out their army

952
01:24:59,396 --> 01:25:01,830
then turn around and save their lives?

953
01:25:01,866 --> 01:25:03,993
Those you'd defeated before...

954
01:25:04,034 --> 01:25:06,434
will they accept your help?

955
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:12,208
Frankly speaking

956
01:25:13,477 --> 01:25:15,104
I'm never sure

957
01:25:16,247 --> 01:25:18,340
whether those people I had helped

958
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:22,746
really appreciate what I've done for them...

959
01:25:24,288 --> 01:25:28,850
Then, Mozi's universal love
is just blind talking?

960
01:25:32,163 --> 01:25:34,290
Nothing is perfect

961
01:25:35,099 --> 01:25:36,964
I just want no regrets in my life

962
01:25:38,335 --> 01:25:39,802
Blacksmith

963
01:25:39,837 --> 01:25:43,500
is the pot ready?

964
01:25:43,541 --> 01:25:44,565
Sure

965
01:25:44,608 --> 01:25:47,008
Mr. Ge Li is a true hero

966
01:25:47,044 --> 01:25:48,739
He's humble and skilled

967
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,476
Just the opposite to our royals

968
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:56,117
If our King got a bit of his talent

969
01:25:56,153 --> 01:25:58,678
Liang will be undefeatable

970
01:26:01,892 --> 01:26:03,086
Mr. Ge Li

971
01:26:03,794 --> 01:26:05,022
Mr. Ge Li

972
01:26:05,062 --> 01:26:06,290
we are all set

973
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:07,456
Let's go

974
01:26:07,498 --> 01:26:09,591
Is this really going to work?

975
01:26:09,633 --> 01:26:11,533
That's psychological tactic

976
01:26:11,569 --> 01:26:14,970
Can you really cook Zhao food?

977
01:26:15,005 --> 01:26:18,372
I can guarantee that
the Zhaos will be miss home-

978
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:19,706
Here are the firewoods

979
01:26:19,743 --> 01:26:20,710
Put it here

980
01:26:21,912 --> 01:26:22,606
Thank you

981
01:26:22,646 --> 01:26:24,307
Pass me the seasoning

982
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:25,542
Mr. Ge Li...

983
01:26:28,419 --> 01:26:29,351
How is it?

984
01:26:29,386 --> 01:26:31,513
There's no one is the Zhao camp

985
01:26:31,555 --> 01:26:32,180
They retreated?

986
01:26:32,223 --> 01:26:34,453
Yes. It's abandoned. Nothing's there

987
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:37,153
You guys first go back.
I'll go and check it out

988
01:26:40,598 --> 01:26:41,997
Come on

989
01:26:42,032 --> 01:26:43,397
Let's have some meat

990
01:26:45,636 --> 01:26:47,763
Is that Zhao's food? What a great smell

991
01:26:50,608 --> 01:26:51,939
Open the Gate

992
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:53,603
Ge Li is back

993
01:27:09,627 --> 01:27:12,892
By order of the Royal Court

994
01:27:12,930 --> 01:27:16,696
Ge Li is defending Liang under false pretenses

995
01:27:16,734 --> 01:27:20,670
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

996
01:27:20,704 --> 01:27:23,138
Be arrested, otherwise

997
01:27:23,173 --> 01:27:24,435
you will be killed

998
01:27:30,347 --> 01:27:31,712
General...

999
01:27:44,561 --> 01:27:45,858
Ge Li!

1000
01:27:52,269 --> 01:27:54,464
I'd always suspected your motives

1001
01:27:58,642 --> 01:28:01,509
How dare you seize my land

1002
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:04,271
I'm going to kill you today

1003
01:28:10,187 --> 01:28:11,347
Take me hostage

1004
01:28:13,557 --> 01:28:15,024
My Prince...

1005
01:28:15,059 --> 01:28:16,356
Thank you

1006
01:28:16,393 --> 01:28:18,293
Draw back

1007
01:28:20,964 --> 01:28:22,056
Move back

1008
01:28:23,567 --> 01:28:24,625
Open the Gate

1009
01:28:24,668 --> 01:28:26,033
Open the Gate

1010
01:28:34,912 --> 01:28:37,710
Ge Li, let go my Prince

1011
01:28:37,748 --> 01:28:39,306
the King will pardon you

1012
01:28:45,456 --> 01:28:47,686
Prepare Ge Li's arrows

1013
01:28:47,725 --> 01:28:48,851
Yes sir

1014
01:28:59,937 --> 01:29:01,029
Thank you

1015
01:29:01,071 --> 01:29:03,904
Mr. Ge Li

1016
01:29:04,775 --> 01:29:06,470
Sir...

1017
01:29:08,145 --> 01:29:09,942
may I follow by your side?

1018
01:29:12,483 --> 01:29:13,882
You should go back

1019
01:29:13,917 --> 01:29:16,715
Staying in Liang is much more important

1020
01:29:16,754 --> 01:29:18,244
Don't you wish to see more people

1021
01:29:18,288 --> 01:29:21,280
passing on Mozi's thought of peace?

1022
01:29:25,062 --> 01:29:26,427
Remember

1023
01:29:26,463 --> 01:29:28,021
those who know how to defend a city

1024
01:29:28,065 --> 01:29:29,896
cannot bring peace to the world

1025
01:29:29,933 --> 01:29:35,530
Peace lies on the kings of all nations

1026
01:29:35,572 --> 01:29:36,698
Understand?

1027
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:40,176
Ge Li, release the Prince

1028
01:29:41,612 --> 01:29:43,512
Ge Li had released me

1029
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:44,809
I'm coming back

1030
01:29:44,848 --> 01:29:46,145
Stop

1031
01:29:46,183 --> 01:29:47,309
Sir

1032
01:29:54,925 --> 01:29:56,017
Thank you

1033
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:57,690
Let's go

1034
01:29:57,728 --> 01:29:59,593
We're not going back

1035
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,029
Where're you guys going?

1036
01:30:01,064 --> 01:30:01,894
Let's go home

1037
01:30:01,932 --> 01:30:03,194
We've got no home

1038
01:30:04,134 --> 01:30:06,932
The Prince is coming back

1039
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:08,130
Get ready

1040
01:30:08,172 --> 01:30:09,639
Yes

1041
01:30:09,673 --> 01:30:11,163
Aren't they...

1042
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:14,234
retreated already? Why...

1043
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,047
What sound is that?

1044
01:30:18,081 --> 01:30:20,948
Shoot as far as you can

1045
01:30:20,984 --> 01:30:22,246
Run

1046
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:23,344
Quick

1047
01:30:26,323 --> 01:30:27,585
Fire

1048
01:30:34,164 --> 01:30:35,631
Run

1049
01:30:40,003 --> 01:30:42,403
Mr. Ge Li

1050
01:30:42,439 --> 01:30:44,964
Don't come back, go

1051
01:30:45,943 --> 01:30:47,433
Go

1052
01:31:04,695 --> 01:31:06,356
Search for the bodies

1053
01:31:06,396 --> 01:31:07,829
Come with me

1054
01:31:17,574 --> 01:31:22,068
My Lordship Liang Shi has fallen

1055
01:31:22,779 --> 01:31:24,872
Your servant has killed the Prince by accident

1056
01:31:24,915 --> 01:31:27,008
I'll never be forgiven

1057
01:31:29,019 --> 01:31:32,853
However, Liang is still under the threat of riot

1058
01:31:32,890 --> 01:31:35,051
I plead with you my Lord

1059
01:31:35,092 --> 01:31:38,220
to let me accomplish
my mission in a hundred days

1060
01:31:38,262 --> 01:31:40,457
I swear I can eliminate all Ge Li's league

1061
01:31:43,166 --> 01:31:44,690
I will take my punishment after that

1062
01:31:49,339 --> 01:31:51,307
Please, My Lord

1063
01:31:53,076 --> 01:31:56,375
Liang Shi...

1064
01:31:56,413 --> 01:31:59,109
is my only son

1065
01:32:01,451 --> 01:32:04,477
he was the future of Liang

1066
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:09,752
You ruined the future of Liang

1067
01:32:09,793 --> 01:32:11,954
Pardoning you?

1068
01:32:15,098 --> 01:32:18,124
That's ridiculous

1069
01:32:26,043 --> 01:32:28,204
But taking into account of your loyalty

1070
01:32:29,513 --> 01:32:33,745
and all you've done in defending Liang

1071
01:32:37,321 --> 01:32:39,312
moreover...

1072
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:43,754
protection of Liang

1073
01:32:44,728 --> 01:32:47,959
cannot lie on outsiders

1074
01:32:53,337 --> 01:32:56,738
I'm in a hard position

1075
01:32:59,576 --> 01:33:03,535
I'll accept your plea. Hundred days later

1076
01:33:05,415 --> 01:33:06,939
your accusation will be denounced

1077
01:33:09,286 --> 01:33:11,015
Thank you, My Lord

1078
01:33:28,071 --> 01:33:31,507
Why are you taking me?
What have I done?

1079
01:33:47,858 --> 01:33:50,326
General, what's happening here?

1080
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:52,260
The King's decree

1081
01:33:52,295 --> 01:33:53,523
capture all the rebels

1082
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:01,627
Rinse again with water

1083
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:07,742
What have you asked me for, Sir?

1084
01:34:11,048 --> 01:34:12,777
The King ordered you to kill Ge Li

1085
01:34:12,816 --> 01:34:14,909
Why didn't you shoot him last night?

1086
01:34:18,188 --> 01:34:19,746
Ge Li has done nothing wrong

1087
01:34:21,024 --> 01:34:23,015
He saved all the Liang people

1088
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,527
You disobeyed the King's command

1089
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:29,291
You will be punished

1090
01:34:29,332 --> 01:34:30,264
What do you guys want?

1091
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:31,927
Let go of me

1092
01:34:31,968 --> 01:34:32,935
Stop

1093
01:34:34,604 --> 01:34:36,071
Stop

1094
01:35:07,504 --> 01:35:09,836
Sometimes, I really don't know...

1095
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:13,009
what is cause and effect

1096
01:35:19,249 --> 01:35:20,614
There's no cause and effect

1097
01:35:24,287 --> 01:35:28,189
You saved them, and they turn against you

1098
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,892
Mozi...

1099
01:35:32,929 --> 01:35:35,659
doesn't ask for returns

1100
01:35:39,169 --> 01:35:42,730
Are all Mozis like that?

1101
01:35:42,773 --> 01:35:46,072
How come you came here alone?

1102
01:35:48,178 --> 01:35:50,544
Mozi...

1103
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,480
didn't send anyone to Liang

1104
01:35:56,219 --> 01:35:57,618
You came here on your own will?

1105
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:01,787
How many cities can you protect?

1106
01:36:02,459 --> 01:36:05,690
There are never ending wars and battles

1107
01:36:05,729 --> 01:36:09,597
peace will only come

1108
01:36:09,633 --> 01:36:12,261
when the seven nations are united

1109
01:36:12,302 --> 01:36:14,998
I believe universal love

1110
01:36:15,038 --> 01:36:17,404
is the only path towards peace

1111
01:36:20,977 --> 01:36:26,313
Mozi's "universal love" is loving everyone

1112
01:36:26,349 --> 01:36:31,514
that means you don't know whom you should love

1113
01:36:42,165 --> 01:36:44,099
Where are you going?

1114
01:36:44,134 --> 01:36:45,328
To Liang

1115
01:36:45,368 --> 01:36:48,269
and let someone I love know that I am safe

1116
01:36:52,609 --> 01:36:56,670
It's all underground stream here

1117
01:36:56,713 --> 01:36:57,907
and you're injured

1118
01:36:57,948 --> 01:37:00,849
It's too dangerous, I'll go for you

1119
01:37:14,497 --> 01:37:16,328
Your Majesty

1120
01:37:16,366 --> 01:37:19,062
these people were in league with Ge Li

1121
01:37:19,102 --> 01:37:20,330
They are traitors

1122
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:22,531
My Lord...

1123
01:37:22,572 --> 01:37:27,737
I have nothing to do with Ge Li

1124
01:37:27,777 --> 01:37:32,305
I know nothing about his rebellion...

1125
01:37:34,184 --> 01:37:35,515
Immoral, selfish

1126
01:37:37,120 --> 01:37:39,179
When everyone praise Ge Li

1127
01:37:39,222 --> 01:37:41,986
respect him and listen to him

1128
01:37:42,025 --> 01:37:42,957
Will you say such things?

1129
01:37:42,993 --> 01:37:47,794
I'm just a farmer, I just want to live my life

1130
01:37:47,831 --> 01:37:51,631
I don't care who's a hero

1131
01:37:51,668 --> 01:37:54,262
I just miss my family, my child

1132
01:37:54,304 --> 01:37:58,365
my home... My Lord...

1133
01:37:59,509 --> 01:38:01,636
Your city is in great danger

1134
01:38:02,379 --> 01:38:06,008
and you are just self-seeking

1135
01:38:06,616 --> 01:38:09,744
Don't you know how many unfortunate lives

1136
01:38:09,786 --> 01:38:12,550
we had lost to save our city?

1137
01:38:12,589 --> 01:38:14,523
Without Ge Li

1138
01:38:14,557 --> 01:38:16,582
we never would have been saved

1139
01:38:16,626 --> 01:38:18,116
Guard

1140
01:38:19,562 --> 01:38:20,824
Sir

1141
01:38:20,864 --> 01:38:21,558
Slap her

1142
01:38:21,598 --> 01:38:22,530
Yes

1143
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:35,377
You are the descendants of my loyal servant

1144
01:38:35,412 --> 01:38:40,247
and you grew up with my beloved son

1145
01:38:40,283 --> 01:38:44,617
I'll have mercy on you, I'm granting you death

1146
01:38:44,654 --> 01:38:47,555
you'll have a Royal funeral

1147
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:51,287
you'll be honored as Calvary Princess

1148
01:38:51,328 --> 01:38:55,822
and buried with my beloved son...

1149
01:38:55,865 --> 01:38:57,423
It's all rubbish

1150
01:38:58,969 --> 01:39:01,096
You just want me

1151
01:39:01,137 --> 01:39:04,595
to be a burial item in your son's tomb

1152
01:39:04,641 --> 01:39:07,007
You want all of us

1153
01:39:07,043 --> 01:39:09,944
to die under you verdict

1154
01:39:12,048 --> 01:39:14,016
so as to prove and

1155
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:16,109
show your power

1156
01:39:16,152 --> 01:39:17,813
But if it wasn't Ge Li

1157
01:39:17,854 --> 01:39:20,948
and those who died in the war

1158
01:39:20,991 --> 01:39:22,720
Would you still be able

1159
01:39:22,759 --> 01:39:24,192
to abuse your people?

1160
01:39:24,227 --> 01:39:25,694
Shut up

1161
01:39:27,864 --> 01:39:30,424
This girl no longer
belongs to the royal families

1162
01:39:30,467 --> 01:39:33,459
She was in league with Ge Li

1163
01:39:33,503 --> 01:39:36,131
She will be executed in the public...

1164
01:39:36,172 --> 01:39:38,572
ripped to shreds by five horses

1165
01:39:46,716 --> 01:39:47,683
Execute

1166
01:39:49,019 --> 01:39:50,543
Execute them all

1167
01:39:50,587 --> 01:39:51,986
Yes

1168
01:39:52,022 --> 01:39:53,046
Execution

1169
01:39:53,089 --> 01:39:56,058
My Lord! My Lord

1170
01:40:04,167 --> 01:40:07,432
Report to the King, Yi Yue was muted

1171
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:08,437
Yes

1172
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,711
Warriors

1173
01:41:25,748 --> 01:41:29,047
behind this slope, there is a city

1174
01:41:29,085 --> 01:41:31,952
in that city, there're 4,000 people

1175
01:41:32,489 --> 01:41:35,049
but under the ground outside this city

1176
01:41:35,091 --> 01:41:37,389
there're 5,000 warriors

1177
01:41:37,427 --> 01:41:42,831
friends and brothers who came with us

1178
01:41:42,866 --> 01:41:45,061
we can't just leave them there

1179
01:41:45,768 --> 01:41:49,397
they were killed even after

1180
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:52,135
throwing down their weapons

1181
01:41:52,175 --> 01:41:54,666
their bodies were even

1182
01:41:54,711 --> 01:41:57,441
tossed from the Wall...

1183
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:02,315
we'll fight for our
fallen brothers to our last soldier

1184
01:42:20,937 --> 01:42:22,370
Start

1185
01:42:35,351 --> 01:42:36,841
What's that?

1186
01:42:38,488 --> 01:42:41,457
Anything you want to say?

1187
01:42:59,509 --> 01:43:01,033
What did you see?

1188
01:43:01,077 --> 01:43:02,408
There's nothing

1189
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:08,474
Look! Over there

1190
01:43:10,887 --> 01:43:13,856
Zhao is attacking again

1191
01:43:13,890 --> 01:43:15,551
Shoot them

1192
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:23,255
The Zhao's here...

1193
01:43:27,604 --> 01:43:28,434
Protect the King

1194
01:43:28,471 --> 01:43:29,631
Hurry up, protect the King

1195
01:43:29,672 --> 01:43:31,299
My Lord, this way

1196
01:43:32,342 --> 01:43:34,606
Get more soldiers up here

1197
01:43:37,513 --> 01:43:39,913
Wait! How about us?

1198
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:42,714
All soldiers report to you captain

1199
01:43:44,821 --> 01:43:45,913
Bring her back to the prison

1200
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,952
Come with me

1201
01:44:01,871 --> 01:44:02,929
No! Stop

1202
01:44:02,972 --> 01:44:04,030
Stop

1203
01:44:04,073 --> 01:44:05,870
Stop shooting

1204
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:08,671
Go, quick

1205
01:44:08,711 --> 01:44:09,837
Go

1206
01:44:13,483 --> 01:44:14,814
General...

1207
01:44:14,851 --> 01:44:17,285
General, let's go

1208
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,878
Go?

1209
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:21,583
This is betrayal

1210
01:44:23,159 --> 01:44:25,252
If you won't leave, neither will we

1211
01:44:28,865 --> 01:44:30,264
General

1212
01:44:31,034 --> 01:44:32,695
whatever we do...

1213
01:44:32,735 --> 01:44:34,669
we're all rebels

1214
01:44:34,704 --> 01:44:37,434
All your men have been...

1215
01:44:37,473 --> 01:44:39,202
dispersed already

1216
01:44:40,777 --> 01:44:42,836
or you would like...

1217
01:44:42,879 --> 01:44:46,076
to see us all get our wrists broken?

1218
01:44:53,122 --> 01:44:55,454
Fight for our homeland

1219
01:45:01,597 --> 01:45:02,859
Bring more arrows here

1220
01:45:29,792 --> 01:45:31,350
Kill all those who tried to run

1221
01:45:31,928 --> 01:45:33,555
and all those evade

1222
01:45:33,596 --> 01:45:35,359
What's going on, sister?

1223
01:45:35,398 --> 01:45:36,262
Come, quick

1224
01:45:51,914 --> 01:45:53,575
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1225
01:45:53,616 --> 01:45:56,016
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1226
01:45:56,052 --> 01:45:57,713
Alright

1227
01:45:57,754 --> 01:45:59,722
I'll be right behind the wall

1228
01:46:15,037 --> 01:46:16,868
Run?

1229
01:46:20,076 --> 01:46:21,976
Get the horses out, quick

1230
01:46:23,146 --> 01:46:24,113
Hurry up

1231
01:46:24,580 --> 01:46:26,912
Kill all those who run

1232
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,157
Go

1233
01:46:35,892 --> 01:46:36,551
General

1234
01:46:36,592 --> 01:46:38,719
The archers had taken down the North Gate

1235
01:46:38,761 --> 01:46:41,787
around 800 of them had escaped

1236
01:46:43,933 --> 01:46:45,924
Abandon the North Gate

1237
01:46:46,936 --> 01:46:48,836
get all soldiers to the Bulwark

1238
01:46:48,871 --> 01:46:50,065
await for my command

1239
01:46:50,106 --> 01:46:51,073
Yes

1240
01:47:08,558 --> 01:47:10,185
General

1241
01:47:10,226 --> 01:47:11,955
it's over

1242
01:47:11,994 --> 01:47:13,552
we should...

1243
01:47:13,596 --> 01:47:14,756
surrender

1244
01:47:14,797 --> 01:47:16,025
We can't surrender...

1245
01:47:16,065 --> 01:47:17,896
General, Ge Li said

1246
01:47:17,934 --> 01:47:20,425
if we surrender, we will end up even worst

1247
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:22,665
General, Ge Li said that...

1248
01:47:24,207 --> 01:47:27,506
Stop talking about Ge Li, there're only us now

1249
01:47:27,543 --> 01:47:29,135
General...

1250
01:47:32,215 --> 01:47:33,477
Any arrows left?

1251
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:35,679
Listen

1252
01:47:36,652 --> 01:47:38,984
We can't rely on others

1253
01:47:39,021 --> 01:47:40,545
We have to hang on even if we have

1254
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:42,114
only one soldier left

1255
01:47:46,095 --> 01:47:48,393
General...

1256
01:47:48,431 --> 01:47:50,695
the enemies are here. Leave now

1257
01:47:50,733 --> 01:47:52,291
Everybody, run now

1258
01:47:57,673 --> 01:47:58,731
Let's go

1259
01:48:13,322 --> 01:48:14,755
General...

1260
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:16,189
run...

1261
01:48:20,429 --> 01:48:22,488
This person is the great General Niu

1262
01:49:26,996 --> 01:49:27,963
Commander

1263
01:49:27,997 --> 01:49:31,455
defending the city is Ge Li's intention

1264
01:49:32,134 --> 01:49:33,761
Commander

1265
01:49:33,803 --> 01:49:38,570
we're suppose to hand him over to you...

1266
01:49:38,608 --> 01:49:41,475
but he had escaped

1267
01:49:56,225 --> 01:49:58,250
Ge Li...

1268
01:49:58,661 --> 01:50:00,993
Ge Li...

1269
01:50:01,797 --> 01:50:03,662
by tomorrow's noon time

1270
01:50:03,699 --> 01:50:06,190
if you don't come back...

1271
01:50:06,235 --> 01:50:08,260
we'll burn down the City

1272
01:50:08,304 --> 01:50:11,432
and its entire people

1273
01:50:16,545 --> 01:50:18,479
Please lead us to fight back

1274
01:50:18,514 --> 01:50:20,573
I am willing to give up my life

1275
01:50:20,616 --> 01:50:22,777
So do we

1276
01:50:22,818 --> 01:50:24,809
If we go back, more people will die

1277
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,954
Why can't we end this war...

1278
01:50:33,996 --> 01:50:37,090
in a rational way?

1279
01:50:37,600 --> 01:50:39,591
You really want to go back?

1280
01:50:40,436 --> 01:50:41,630
...is it worth it?

1281
01:50:44,707 --> 01:50:46,299
If this can really stop the war

1282
01:50:48,577 --> 01:50:50,568
and save more lives

1283
01:50:51,213 --> 01:50:52,544
why not?

1284
01:50:53,716 --> 01:50:54,774
...is it worth it?

1285
01:50:58,788 --> 01:51:01,450
Bring all the men out, leave the women here

1286
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:03,014
Go, quick

1287
01:51:04,160 --> 01:51:05,923
Keep moving, hurry up

1288
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:17,835
Commander, I think Ge Li will not come

1289
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:28,610
We'd taken Liang already, why don't we go back?

1290
01:51:28,651 --> 01:51:30,676
We can reach our main force

1291
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:33,587
and return Handan

1292
01:51:33,622 --> 01:51:35,590
and protect our homeland

1293
01:51:36,592 --> 01:51:38,583
Isn't that just another battle field?

1294
01:51:38,627 --> 01:51:41,755
There's only victory & defeat

1295
01:51:43,165 --> 01:51:45,531
we have taken Liang

1296
01:51:45,568 --> 01:51:47,832
but it's not a victory

1297
01:51:47,870 --> 01:51:50,202
Ge Li had lost

1298
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:54,938
His theory is impractical,
idealism leads to jealousy

1299
01:51:55,978 --> 01:51:58,105
He can't even gain the trust

1300
01:51:58,147 --> 01:52:00,411
of those he helped

1301
01:52:00,449 --> 01:52:02,713
He was totally beaten

1302
01:52:03,953 --> 01:52:07,081
There is no winner in this battle

1303
01:52:07,123 --> 01:52:10,854
I know Ge Li had lost

1304
01:52:10,893 --> 01:52:12,656
but...

1305
01:52:12,695 --> 01:52:15,425
I had to defeat him myself

1306
01:52:41,323 --> 01:52:43,348
Someone is coming

1307
01:52:43,392 --> 01:52:45,826
Mr Ge Li?

1308
01:52:55,404 --> 01:52:56,336
Close the Gate

1309
01:53:08,384 --> 01:53:09,976
Commander

1310
01:53:10,019 --> 01:53:11,111
on the battlefield

1311
01:53:12,054 --> 01:53:13,248
we had a fair fight

1312
01:53:14,023 --> 01:53:15,388
and no regrets

1313
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:17,716
You've taken Liang already

1314
01:53:19,328 --> 01:53:21,262
why do you have to kill all its people?

1315
01:53:23,132 --> 01:53:24,156
Nonsense

1316
01:53:26,635 --> 01:53:29,399
You think war is a game?

1317
01:53:30,439 --> 01:53:32,805
They fought for you

1318
01:53:32,842 --> 01:53:34,207
you failed

1319
01:53:34,243 --> 01:53:36,211
and with no responsibility

1320
01:53:36,245 --> 01:53:37,906
you left

1321
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:41,681
It's you...

1322
01:53:41,717 --> 01:53:44,515
you bring them to the battlefield

1323
01:53:48,557 --> 01:53:49,751
Fine

1324
01:53:49,792 --> 01:53:51,817
It's totally between you and me

1325
01:53:53,863 --> 01:53:57,390
Will Commander end all this with me alone

1326
01:53:57,433 --> 01:54:00,493
on the gate tower?

1327
01:54:01,337 --> 01:54:03,066
No matter who wins

1328
01:54:06,775 --> 01:54:09,107
please spare these people's life

1329
01:54:09,879 --> 01:54:12,575
It is all between me and Ge Li

1330
01:54:12,615 --> 01:54:15,413
Only one of us can walk out from the Gate Tower

1331
01:54:15,451 --> 01:54:18,352
No matter who he is

1332
01:54:18,387 --> 01:54:20,412
everything will end

1333
01:54:28,764 --> 01:54:31,130
What are you waiting for?

1334
01:54:31,166 --> 01:54:32,326
Let's start

1335
01:54:32,368 --> 01:54:33,596
Forget it

1336
01:54:35,204 --> 01:54:37,764
As you had said

1337
01:54:37,806 --> 01:54:39,706
no matter who get out of here

1338
01:54:39,742 --> 01:54:41,869
this whole thing will be over

1339
01:54:42,478 --> 01:54:45,606
Go now, Ge Li is willing to stay here

1340
01:54:46,348 --> 01:54:47,713
Good strategy

1341
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:50,108
I promised to retreat

1342
01:54:51,053 --> 01:54:53,044
just because I want to defeat you

1343
01:54:53,622 --> 01:54:56,090
but now, you give up

1344
01:54:56,125 --> 01:54:59,253
I am leading 100,000 soldiers

1345
01:54:59,295 --> 01:55:02,753
but before attacking Yan,
I'd already lost 5,000 men

1346
01:55:02,798 --> 01:55:05,528
and afterall, I didn't get Liang

1347
01:55:05,567 --> 01:55:07,626
but at least...

1348
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:09,399
now...

1349
01:55:09,438 --> 01:55:11,338
I can kill you

1350
01:55:11,373 --> 01:55:13,238
and take revenge for my men

1351
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:21,082
Don't use the dead ones as an excuse

1352
01:55:22,318 --> 01:55:24,377
to cover up your savageness

1353
01:55:26,121 --> 01:55:27,213
War...

1354
01:55:28,824 --> 01:55:31,918
will only cause more death

1355
01:55:32,995 --> 01:55:36,954
Both the dead and
the living ones have to suffer...

1356
01:55:36,999 --> 01:55:38,261
Enough

1357
01:55:40,836 --> 01:55:43,202
In battlefields

1358
01:55:43,238 --> 01:55:46,002
survivors are the winners

1359
01:55:51,013 --> 01:55:52,776
Survivors are winners?

1360
01:55:55,451 --> 01:55:56,816
Though you survive

1361
01:55:58,921 --> 01:56:01,890
can your 5,000 soldiers come back?

1362
01:56:06,328 --> 01:56:07,590
Retreat

1363
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,927
end this war now

1364
01:56:15,537 --> 01:56:17,164
or else...

1365
01:56:18,774 --> 01:56:21,174
the rest of your men

1366
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:23,178
will also lose their lives

1367
01:56:56,945 --> 01:56:58,708
My auxiliary troop has arrived

1368
01:57:39,955 --> 01:57:41,582
General Wei, we're besieged

1369
01:57:41,623 --> 01:57:42,282
Warrirors

1370
01:57:43,325 --> 01:57:45,418
Fight

1371
01:57:52,034 --> 01:57:55,333
Everybody fight and drive the Zhaos out

1372
01:58:08,016 --> 01:58:09,608
That way

1373
01:58:21,163 --> 01:58:22,391
Ask yourself

1374
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,397
Is it for the soldiers

1375
01:58:26,435 --> 01:58:28,596
or for your own savageness?

1376
01:58:30,706 --> 01:58:32,037
Please leave

1377
01:58:33,675 --> 01:58:37,475
don't let any more people lose their lives...

1378
01:58:44,186 --> 01:58:45,517
Go now

1379
01:58:46,522 --> 01:58:48,319
I was defeated

1380
01:58:48,357 --> 01:58:51,884
I'm staying here

1381
01:58:52,694 --> 01:58:54,355
Please go

1382
01:58:55,264 --> 01:58:56,288
Commander...

1383
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,161
Survivors are the winners

1384
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:10,141
Commander

1385
01:59:11,046 --> 01:59:13,105
is victory

1386
01:59:13,148 --> 01:59:15,013
more important than your life?

1387
01:59:19,054 --> 01:59:22,421
My life must be meaningful

1388
01:59:24,793 --> 01:59:26,283
Please go

1389
01:59:26,328 --> 01:59:28,319
and tell my people to leave

1390
01:59:28,363 --> 01:59:30,024
I can't help you

1391
01:59:32,467 --> 01:59:34,128
You bring them here

1392
01:59:34,169 --> 01:59:36,194
you should save them

1393
01:59:37,906 --> 01:59:39,771
There is someone I have to save

1394
01:59:53,388 --> 01:59:54,821
Yi Yue...

1395
01:59:55,958 --> 01:59:57,516
Yi Yue...

1396
02:00:04,866 --> 02:00:06,163
Shoot

1397
02:00:08,237 --> 02:00:09,670
Don't run

1398
02:00:09,705 --> 02:00:11,104
Attack

1399
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:24,342
Yi Yue...

1400
02:01:30,452 --> 02:01:36,254
Can you hear me? Are you there?

1401
02:01:47,202 --> 02:01:52,105
Yi Yue! Where are you?

1402
02:01:54,109 --> 02:01:55,804
Yi Yue...

1403
02:01:58,547 --> 02:02:00,606
Commander, we must leave now

1404
02:02:01,683 --> 02:02:05,346
You all leave now.
General Wei will lead you home

1405
02:02:05,387 --> 02:02:06,445
Commander...

1406
02:02:06,488 --> 02:02:08,422
This is my command

1407
02:02:08,457 --> 02:02:11,358
I want you all to leave

1408
02:02:12,661 --> 02:02:15,425
Back to you homeland

1409
02:02:16,865 --> 02:02:18,093
Yes

1410
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,834
Listen

1411
02:02:27,509 --> 02:02:28,908
Aim at their feet

1412
02:02:28,944 --> 02:02:30,070
Ready

1413
02:02:31,313 --> 02:02:32,473
Shoot

1414
02:02:47,796 --> 02:02:50,765
General Wei, the Commander ordered you

1415
02:02:50,799 --> 02:02:52,596
to lead our retreat

1416
02:02:53,735 --> 02:02:55,259
Retreat

1417
02:02:56,671 --> 02:02:58,070
Leave now

1418
02:02:59,107 --> 02:03:02,440
I'll stay with the Commander

1419
02:03:02,477 --> 02:03:04,172
The commander ordered you

1420
02:03:04,212 --> 02:03:06,271
to lead our retreat

1421
02:03:06,314 --> 02:03:08,043
We came together, we'll leave together

1422
02:03:08,083 --> 02:03:10,142
Right! We came together
and leave together

1423
02:03:10,185 --> 02:03:11,743
Yes, we'll leave together

1424
02:03:12,687 --> 02:03:14,120
I'm not leaving

1425
02:03:14,156 --> 02:03:15,316
Go now

1426
02:03:15,357 --> 02:03:17,587
Take the General

1427
02:03:17,626 --> 02:03:18,684
Let me down

1428
02:03:19,561 --> 02:03:21,028
I'm not leaving

1429
02:03:21,062 --> 02:03:23,895
Let me down, that's my order...

1430
02:03:25,033 --> 02:03:26,432
Let me down

1431
02:03:27,469 --> 02:03:29,699
I order you to let me down...

1432
02:06:08,730 --> 02:06:09,719
Shoot

1433
02:06:09,764 --> 02:06:10,924
Yes

1434
02:06:11,900 --> 02:06:13,060
Archers

1435
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,933
Get ready

1436
02:06:16,104 --> 02:06:17,093
Shoot

1437
02:06:37,726 --> 02:06:38,988
Long live My Lord

1438
02:06:40,895 --> 02:06:42,760
Long live My Lord

1439
02:07:19,768 --> 02:07:21,429
Where's General?

1440
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:58,398
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1441
02:07:58,440 --> 02:08:00,704
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1442
02:08:02,677 --> 02:08:04,611
I'll be right behind the wall

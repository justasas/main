00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,695
Temptation Of An Angel

2
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:04,695
Episode 16

3
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,357
Joo Ah Ran, right?

4
00:00:21,184 --> 00:00:22,965
I'm the police.

5
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,260
Let's take a trip to the station.

6
00:00:26,002 --> 00:00:28,143
What is the matter?

7
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,690
October 13,the traffic accident
that took place on Chang Won Street,

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,167
here is the statement for the real criminal,
Joo Ah Ran.

9
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:41,168
Who wrote this?

10
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,140
Shin Hyun Woo this.

11
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,111
Shin Hyun Woo.

12
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:47,974
That's ridiculous.

13
00:00:48,419 --> 00:00:50,632
How could a dead person write a statement.

14
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:53,197
Let's talk about it in the station.

15
00:01:29,763 --> 00:01:31,841
Come to the police station immediately.

16
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:34,115
The police came to look for
me all of a sudden,

17
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:37,338
with Shin Hyun Woo's statement, saying that
I was the perpetrator of the traffic accident.

18
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,843
I'll go now.

19
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:40,603
Try and delay some time.

20
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:43,152
Don't panic,
and speak as little as possible.

21
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,258
Shin Hyun Woo...

22
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,143
your real intentions are finally revealed.

23
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,429
It's me, Jae Sung.

24
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:21,872
Are you busy?

25
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,077
I have to reserve plane tickets.

26
00:02:24,197 --> 00:02:25,752
Where are you?

27
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,360
I have something on, I'm far away.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,651
I'll call you when it's done.

29
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,458
My husband is dead.

30
00:02:46,578 --> 00:02:49,935
Someone must be using my
husband's name to play a trick.

31
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,744
The death certificate hasn't been issued,
how can he be dead?

32
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:59,852
The fingerprint on the statement,
has been verified as Shin Hyun Woo's.

33
00:03:01,302 --> 00:03:04,773
If Shin Hyun Woo is alive,
then call him to come here.

34
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,757
If not,
we can't cooperate with this investigation.

35
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,429
That's right.

36
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,286
When my husband met with an accident,
I wasn't even there.

37
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:13,894
If it's true...

38
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,862
I want to confront Shin Hyun Woo.

39
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,614
And then,
I'll accept my punishment willingly.

40
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,925
Episode 16

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,406
Really...

42
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,875
really,
Shin Hyun Woo is alive?

43
00:03:34,123 --> 00:03:39,393
The words on the statement,
is definitely Shin Hyun Woo's.

44
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,796
Even if he's alive, we don't have to worry.

45
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:44,102
We already know the intentions
and plans of the other side,

46
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:46,663
and we definitely won't suffer easily.

47
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:50,833
How was the search for the plastic
surgery results at the medical insurance company?

48
00:03:50,953 --> 00:03:52,444
I'm about to go now.

49
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:53,756
Get up.

50
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:55,661
Because of the rule against
personal information,

51
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:58,815
we cannot make personal
medical information public.

52
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,955
Hold on.

53
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:07,791
If Shin Hyun Woo is alive...

54
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,161
he must have carried out bank transactions.

55
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,598
We have to look into the banking transactions
that Shin Hyun woo made after the fire.

56
00:04:12,718 --> 00:04:15,392
It wasn't even him,
what's there to look into?

57
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,424
Only one side can win.

58
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:20,260
Let's go look for the police...

59
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,336
and prove that my husband disappeared
in his vegetative state, to seek help.

60
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,702
Then, we'll find the bank
that cooperated with Shin Hyun Woo,

61
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:32,003
and look at the CCTV,
it should have Shin Hyun Woo's face on it.

62
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,229
It's Ahn Jae Sung!

63
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,890
How can that be?

64
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,807
Then...

65
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:12,648
Nothing has changed.

66
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,378
We just have to do as we planned,
organize everything and get out of here.

67
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:18,123
Ahn Jae Sung goes back to being
Shin Hyun Woo,

68
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:21,657
and before he reveals everything,
we have to be on a plane, no matter what.

69
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,541
Why are you in a daze?

70
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:30,154
Are you that disappointed
that Ahn Jae Sung is Shin Hyun Woo?

71
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:34,832
Did you really...
fall in love with him?

72
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:35,932
No.

73
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,844
- I just can't accept what I've been through.
- Don't think about it.

74
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,214
He just returned the favor.

75
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:46,241
Today, I'll take care of
the hospital and the apartment.

76
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:47,922
<i>You do the same thing.</i>

77
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:50,864
I know.

78
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:54,335
He camouflaged himself
so perfectly as Ahn Jae Sung,

79
00:05:54,455 --> 00:05:57,467
yet, he got still hilariously
got caught by the CCTV,

80
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,320
if it wasn't for revenge,
would he have changed his face?

81
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,458
When he found out that we left,

82
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:07,696
he would wail and cry to the heavens,
wouldn't he.

83
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,480
Heaven is on our side.

84
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,367
What happened?

85
00:06:21,487 --> 00:06:24,901
The fact that Ahjussi is Shin Hyun Woo,
have they found out?

86
00:06:25,021 --> 00:06:26,996
If the two of them leave,

87
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:29,485
won't Ahjussi's revenge end?

88
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,538
He's waiting so long, enduring so much.

89
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,858
Please arrange the seats a little closer.

90
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:40,693
Yes, I know.

91
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:44,027
So the guests can look forward
a little easier.

92
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,292
Please change the lights.

93
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,050
It's me, Ah Ran.

94
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:58,818
I'm looking at the wedding hall.

95
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:01,622
In order to welcome the most
beautiful bride,

96
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:03,251
I can't be sloppy.

97
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,474
<i>I have something to say,
let's meet.</i>

98
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,505
<i>I'll call you once I'm there.</i>

99
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,253
Yoon Jae Hee.

100
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:29,210
You knew everything right
from the beginning,

101
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,861
and you were planning to fool me?

102
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,244
I have nothing,
that I can say to Madam anymore.

103
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,138
Don't toy with me.

104
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:42,392
If I have a crime to shoulder,
God will give it to me.

105
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:46,512
Who are you to meddle between
a husband and wife?

106
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,801
Husband and wife?

107
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,997
Since when were you husband
and wife with Shin Hyun Woo?

108
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,792
If you were really husband and wife...

109
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:56,903
would you lock your husband in
a countryside villa that had no doctors?

110
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,977
If you were really husband and wife...

111
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:02,617
would you be intimate with another
mean while your husband was fighting for his life?

112
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,508
Now you're unbosoming yourself.

113
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,856
So, the Shin Hyun Woo that couldn't take it,
you wanted to help him?

114
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:17,042
From that guy's vegetative state
to his plastic surgery, you wanted to help him?

115
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,807
Then,
that man would become yours?

116
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:23,638
I heard,
you're getting married to President Ahn.

117
00:08:24,586 --> 00:08:27,528
The beautiful bride's mouth
is a little uncouth, isn't it.

118
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:31,782
This time,
please, don't betray President Ahn.

119
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:41,243
Ahn Jae Sung.

120
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:43,359
Yoon Jae Hee.

121
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:47,211
You actually made me become this pathetic.

122
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,378
Manager, what are you doing?

123
00:08:58,394 --> 00:09:01,632
If Hyung comes back, I want to
change all the furniture in Hyung's house.

124
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:05,611
Hyungsoo is out too, in order to forget
the nightmare, I want to change it all.

125
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:09,201
After she moved out,
what is Ah Ran doing?

126
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:11,444
There's nowhere she can go.

127
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:13,476
How can there be nowhere for her to go?

128
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,333
She probably went to the house
of the man she's crazily in love with.

129
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,981
But,
what has Yeon Jae been doing?

130
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,494
I've been decorating the newlyweds' section.

131
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,332
A new house, just like the newlyweds,
I tried to decorate it.

132
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:27,792
How is it?

133
00:09:28,173 --> 00:09:29,316
Is it childish?

134
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,083
No.

135
00:09:34,057 --> 00:09:36,067
It's warm and touching, it's good.

136
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:37,316
Just like Yeon Jae.

137
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:41,748
Really, really, really, really.

138
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,727
That...

139
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:49,002
Should we...
lie down and try it out?

140
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:52,240
We have to know how comfortable
it is before we introduce it to our customers.

141
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,243
Yeon Jae,
what should we do if customers come?

142
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,729
Hyun Min, it's been a while
since we laid down together.

143
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:05,633
<i>Ahjussi, it's good.</i>

144
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:09,974
Hug me.
Hug me tighter!

145
00:10:13,296 --> 00:10:15,709
You're really humorous,
and cute and charming.

146
00:10:20,923 --> 00:10:24,224
Why are you so cute, witty and lovable?

147
00:10:24,344 --> 00:10:27,405
I really want to put you in a gourd,
and take you out every day.

148
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:31,466
You probably couldn't fit me into a gourd.

149
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,061
Yes, Father?

150
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,437
Father,
what do you mean?

151
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,514
The MyeongSung investment is fake.

152
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:54,857
This is a fax that just came
from MyeongSung.

153
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:59,859
The intention that they had to invest in Soul,
there isn't any in the future.

154
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,123
I was fooled again by that fox.

155
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,271
After we uncovered her job at the bar...

156
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,049
she tried various ways and means to get by.

157
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,653
After she got some time, I don't
know what else she was planning to do with Soul.

158
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,902
Secretary Kang.

159
00:11:14,022 --> 00:11:15,807
Get me Joo Ah Ran's sales report.

160
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:16,971
Yes, President.

161
00:11:20,701 --> 00:11:23,452
This definitely is fake too.

162
00:11:23,572 --> 00:11:25,886
She must have withdrawn
all the investment in Soul...

163
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:27,956
and then pulled her tricks.

164
00:11:28,076 --> 00:11:29,677
<i>Everyone work up some energy...</i>

165
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:33,274
<i>and thoroughly verify the sales
reports from all the different showrooms.</i>

166
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,544
Yes, Father.

167
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,952
Secretary Kang.

168
00:11:55,196 --> 00:11:56,254
You're here.

169
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,920
I wanted to eat lunch with you,
so I was waiting.

170
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,143
We have to book the plane tickets, right?

171
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,793
Could you give me your passport?

172
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:06,567
My friend works at a travel agency,
I'll book the plane tickets.

173
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,176
I've already asked someone to do it.

174
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:09,382
Don't worry,

175
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:11,689
you just have to show up at
the airport on time.

176
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:12,832
Hold on.

177
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:19,509
<i>It must be Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

178
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:22,535
<i>There can't be a passport
with Ahn Jae Sung's name on it.</i>

179
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,355
<i>How did he survive?</i>

180
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,757
<i>Was he not at the villa during the fire?</i>

181
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,641
<i>But why didn't he come back?</i>

182
00:12:28,761 --> 00:12:31,752
<i>Who did he want to drive insane,
that he pulled these tricks?</i>

183
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:44,120
<i>It's a good shot, right?</i>

184
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,745
The last time we went to the park,
I took it,

185
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:50,006
and I put it here to look
at it every time I thought of you.

186
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:52,398
I'm hungry,
let's hurry and go.

187
00:13:01,256 --> 00:13:02,420
Yoon Jae Hee.

188
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:09,237
Don't misunderstand.

189
00:13:09,576 --> 00:13:11,967
The other time Jae Hee brought it,

190
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:14,211
and it wasn't nice to throw it away,
so I left it.

191
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,687
This photograph has no other meaning.

192
00:13:17,216 --> 00:13:19,384
Do you expect me to believe that right now?

193
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,109
Your love, sometimes there are two,
sometimes there are three.

194
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,522
I can't believe this kind of man,
and fly to America.

195
00:13:25,642 --> 00:13:27,278
Let's break up.

196
00:13:27,398 --> 00:13:28,823
What did you say?

197
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,487
We've even booked the wedding hall.

198
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:32,778
Now, you want to cancel the wedding?

199
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:35,614
The person who betrayed our trust first wasn't me,
but Jae Sung.

200
00:13:35,734 --> 00:13:36,859
Let's not talk about anything else,

201
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:39,653
but I can't start with a man
who thinks about other women in his heart.

202
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,791
You won't regret this?

203
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:51,548
A woman who leaves once,

204
00:13:51,668 --> 00:13:53,813
I'm not a man that will chase after her.

205
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,620
Of course.

206
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,456
Our destiny ends here.

207
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,165
Let's not meet till the day we die.

208
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:03,684
<i>Ah Ran!</i>

209
00:14:09,506 --> 00:14:11,326
<i>Shin Hyun Woo is back.</i>

210
00:14:11,622 --> 00:14:13,993
<i>The person who was always
by my side was Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

211
00:14:14,113 --> 00:14:15,449
<i>I have to get away quickly.</i>

212
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:18,200
<i>Once that man opens his mouth,
it's all over.</i>

213
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,465
Joo Seung, it's me.

214
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,498
About us leaving, hurry.

215
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,355
It's too scary,
I don't even want to stay another day.

216
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:37,812
Our son, Hyun Woo,

217
00:14:37,932 --> 00:14:39,759
disappeared during the fire,

218
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,780
he must be living somewhere now,
so I came to look for help.

219
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:47,793
I was just about to look for Shin
Hyun Woo's family, good thing you came.

220
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:49,867
Actually, yesterday...

221
00:14:49,987 --> 00:14:53,169
a statement about the traffic
accident at Chang Won...

222
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:55,518
came from Shin Hyun Woo.

223
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,462
What?

224
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:03,398
From our Hyun Woo?

225
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:08,862
The statement says that,
at the time of the accident,

226
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:10,830
the driver was Joo Ah Ran

227
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,391
and said that she ran away
after the accident.

228
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,701
Then, our Hyun Woo...

229
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:18,902
Can you contact him?

230
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,447
Where is Hyun Woo?

231
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,791
Where can I go to see him?
Please tell me, Officer.

232
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,521
The phone number didn't show up.

233
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:29,935
I contacted him,
and told him to show up before 3.

234
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,559
During this period of time,
we'll ask Joo Ah Ran here as well.

235
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:34,555
Then,
you're saying that at 3,

236
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:38,447
our Hyun Woo will be here?

237
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,189
Hello?

238
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:45,522
Yes,

239
00:15:45,642 --> 00:15:47,406
I'm Joo Ah Ran.

240
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,776
What?

241
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,182
To have a confrontation with Shin Hyun Woo?

242
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:56,796
Shin Hyun Woo is going to
the police station?

243
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,446
It's me.

244
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:58,600
Don't be nervous.
No matter what, face it calmly.

245
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:02,748
Hyun Woo Hyung is not showing up.
No, he can't show up.

246
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:05,015
If he wanted to use the law
from the beginning,

247
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:07,702
he wouldn't return in Ahn Jae Sung's skin.

248
00:17:07,822 --> 00:17:10,997
Furthermore,
there is no evidence...

249
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:13,240
the police can't do anything to you.

250
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,203
Joo Ah Ran one-sidedly called
off the wedding?

251
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:21,484
Even though she gave me a different reason,

252
00:17:22,013 --> 00:17:24,722
Even though she gave me a different reason,

253
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,185
but, I feel like she's found
out my identity.

254
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:31,831
You mean she knows that
President Ahn is her ex-husband?

255
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,947
That's big.

256
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:39,577
We haven't received all the assets that
are under Joo Ah Ran's name, it can't end here.

257
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:45,797
If she knows I'm Shin Hyun Woo,
there will be no way to capture her heart.

258
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:49,056
No matter what, she'll find a way to escape.

259
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:52,436
If tonight, Joo Ah Ran and
Nam Joo Seung leaves tonight...

260
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:54,044
our game is over.

261
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:55,124
<i>No!</i>

262
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:57,325
We definitely cannot give up.

263
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:59,335
In front of Sang Mo's altar,

264
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,446
I promised to dispel any remaining
hate he had.

265
00:18:03,246 --> 00:18:05,676
<i>Because I believed you,
I made it here.</i>

266
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:08,770
No matter what happens, don't disappoint me.

267
00:18:13,754 --> 00:18:15,638
Now, at the police station,

268
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:19,087
they're waiting for me to
confront Joo Ah Ran.

269
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:21,267
If I don't appear...

270
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:25,106
then, it's equivalent to putting
wings on someone who's about to escape,

271
00:18:25,226 --> 00:18:29,487
as well as confirm the belief,
that Shin Hyun Woo is Ahn Jae Sung.

272
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,449
Looks like the confrontation has
to be postponed.

273
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,243
That's why I said...

274
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,439
it looks like someone is playing a trick.

275
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:58,456
That fake statement,
please remember that it has no legal implications.

276
00:18:58,576 --> 00:18:59,874
No!

277
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:02,287
It's definitely a statement
that our Hyun Woo sent.

278
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,123
If that's the case,
why hasn't he appeared by now?

279
00:19:07,421 --> 00:19:09,812
There are two reasons.

280
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:12,289
One is that the contents
of the statement are fake.

281
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,511
Or, the fact that he's alive is a lie.

282
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,331
My son is alive!

283
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,033
He won't die from that little burn.

284
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,033
Are you more comfortable thinking that way?

285
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,083
A son that's dead and can't come back,

286
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:30,723
or a son that's not dead and can't come back,
what's the difference?

287
00:19:38,856 --> 00:19:40,020
Tell me!

288
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,811
Did you hide Hyun Woo?

289
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,245
If not, Hyun Woo does not have
a reason to hide.

290
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,234
What did you do to Hyun Woo?

291
00:19:46,354 --> 00:19:50,213
The traffic accident, the fire at the villa,
it was all done by you!

292
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:55,064
Before I reply,
Mum has to explain herself.

293
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,906
Nothing else is needed.

294
00:19:57,026 --> 00:19:58,429
Tell me!

295
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:02,027
Where is Joo Kyeong Ran?

296
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,009
What?

297
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:05,342
Joo Kyeong Ran?

298
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:07,438
Where did you leave that child?

299
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:08,873
<i>Tell me!</i>

300
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,591
You have to tell me.

301
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,738
I don't know where you heard that from,
but that has nothing to do with you.

302
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:17,658
Who says it has nothing to do with me?

303
00:20:18,357 --> 00:20:19,669
What?

304
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:23,436
Did you leave that child at the
Angel Orphanage?

305
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,321
What did you do to that poor child?

306
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,628
For someone who is so cold
to even the own son that she birthed,

307
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,781
would you look at someone else's child?

308
00:20:31,901 --> 00:20:35,340
How cruel Mother is as a person,
Mother knows best!

309
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,906
What are you doing?

310
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:38,790
You have no reason to know!

311
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,652
Bring Kyeong Ran here.

312
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,510
If something happens to that child,
I'll never forgive you.

313
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,114
Not just Shin Hyun Woo,

314
00:20:45,234 --> 00:20:48,056
I won't let the rest of your children off!

315
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,845
Are you fine?

316
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,130
Oh, I'm fine.

317
00:21:00,506 --> 00:21:02,030
Let's just go.

318
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,202
How does Ah Ran know about Kyeong Ran?

319
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:23,430
Joo Ah Ran,
Joo Kyeong Ran...

320
00:21:24,975 --> 00:21:26,752
it can't be?

321
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:31,173
President, we've found out where the restaurant
that Joo Chul Ming's brother is at right now.

322
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:32,951
Is that so?
Toad like creatures.

323
00:21:33,071 --> 00:21:34,496
This time we can never let them go.

324
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:37,379
Call the restaurant,
and tell them to lock it up!

325
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:39,241
Lead the way.

326
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:47,177
I might as well just
pull my teeth out with pliers.

327
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:50,213
Eating soup and rice, what good is my teeth.

328
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,668
I still have to brush them in the morning,
how annoying.

329
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:55,208
Then just go pull them all out.

330
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,642
As you grow older,
people should be more sensible.

331
00:21:57,762 --> 00:21:59,352
The money hasn't even fallen
from the sky yet,

332
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,468
and you want to eat galbi that much...

333
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:08,297
Where are the people?!

334
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:10,180
Is it this restaurant?

335
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,233
How did they find us here?

336
00:22:12,353 --> 00:22:15,048
Shut up and let's run away!

337
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:29,489
What should we do now?!

338
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:33,087
Looks like you got some courage.

339
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,850
You think by threatening me,
I would take out even 10 dollars?

340
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,268
Secretary Kang.

341
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,465
Call the police immediately.

342
00:22:41,815 --> 00:22:43,465
Wait...

343
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:46,673
what crime did we commit,
that you have to call the police?

344
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:49,833
That... Your wife was the
one who took away our Kyeong Ran,

345
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,971
will the police leave it alone?

346
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:56,293
So,
hurry and give us our Kyeong Ran!

347
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,663
Who took who away?

348
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,473
Do you want to get arrested
for threatening and blackmailing me?

349
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,972
That...President,
we are really wronged.

350
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:09,042
That is.. President, your wife,
took my dead brother's daughter,

351
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:11,116
and she's hiding her and not
giving her back.

352
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:13,909
Can we just stand on the sidelines?

353
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,730
What, daughter?

354
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,003
What is the matter?

355
00:23:27,123 --> 00:23:28,967
Who is Ah Ran?

356
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,375
Who are her parents?
You know, right?

357
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,142
I don't know.
I've never met them.

358
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:39,748
Are Ah Ran's parents still alive?

359
00:23:40,976 --> 00:23:44,193
I heard they died on the
same day when she was young.

360
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,008
They died on the same day?

361
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,256
Why?

362
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:50,760
Is it someone you know?

363
00:23:51,649 --> 00:23:53,067
No.

364
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,988
Then, go home safely.

365
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,177
Ah Ran... how could it be?

366
00:24:04,297 --> 00:24:07,309
It can't be.
That's ridiculous.

367
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,554
You tell me honestly.

368
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,555
What happened to Joo Chul Ming's daughter?

369
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,481
Honey...

370
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:27,650
That family said,
you took their daughter away.

371
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,359
- What does that mean?
- It's not that!

372
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:33,296
It was really sad for her to lose both
her parents, so I just helped a little. Really.

373
00:24:33,416 --> 00:24:34,650
You helped them?

374
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,449
Are you crazy?

375
00:24:36,569 --> 00:24:38,819
It's fine that we gave them
so much compensation.

376
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,555
All my hard-earned money...

377
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,222
what charitable heart was that?

378
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,381
Hurry and tell that family,
where their daughter is,

379
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:47,773
and chase those leeches away, immediately!

380
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:49,614
I really don't know.

381
00:24:49,734 --> 00:24:52,710
I helped after the accident,
but I haven't heard anything after that.

382
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,192
Those words are true right?

383
00:24:54,312 --> 00:24:58,721
Then, if those fellows hang around our door,
call the police.

384
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:04,325
I don't ever want to hear the
name of the annoying Joo Chul Ming again!

385
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:05,891
I know.

386
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:07,373
I know.

387
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,094
Ah Ran.

388
00:25:26,214 --> 00:25:28,591
Let's meet.
I have something to say.

389
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:31,242
Ah Ran.

390
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:32,639
Ah Ran!

391
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:39,962
<i>Looks like our destiny ends here.</i>

392
00:25:40,082 --> 00:25:41,745
<i>Let's not meet till the day we die.</i>

393
00:25:41,865 --> 00:25:44,602
<i>Because I believed you,
I've come this far.</i>

394
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:47,586
<i>No matter what, don't disappoint me.</i>

395
00:26:43,729 --> 00:26:49,154
I hoped that Ahjussi and
Joo Ah Ran wouldn't get married...

396
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:53,461
that would be a good thing for me.

397
00:26:55,006 --> 00:26:57,482
But why...
am I not happy at all?

398
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:02,996
Looking at Ahjussi’s sadness...

399
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:06,827
my heart hurts so much it's
going to explode.

400
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,555
Ahjussi!
What's wrong?

401
00:28:21,675 --> 00:28:23,227
Where does it hurt?
Ahjussi!

402
00:28:23,347 --> 00:28:25,788
Don't look at me,
don't look at me!

403
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,604
I don't want you to see me this way...

404
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:32,128
go home!

405
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:36,509
Ahjussi,
must you definitely carry out that revenge?

406
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,491
If I can't fill Ahjussi up with my love,

407
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:44,729
if there's only that way,

408
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,353
I lose.

409
00:28:47,473 --> 00:28:49,449
Marry Joo Ah Ran.

410
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:53,916
Even if you can't return to my side...

411
00:28:59,398 --> 00:29:01,599
I will let Ahjussi go too.

412
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,243
<i>With me...</i>

413
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,143
<i>Marry me.</i>

414
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,035
Your sister...

415
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:18,770
even if you don't show up,

416
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,162
we can use someone to find her.

417
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:24,464
If she's living somewhere,
we'll find her.

418
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:25,818
No.

419
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,344
I must see Kyeong Ran with
my own eyes before I leave.

420
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:31,164
There's no time.

421
00:30:31,284 --> 00:30:35,778
Just now, Madam came,
and asked about your parents.

422
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,554
Whose daughter you are,
they could probably guess.

423
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,988
It doesn't matter anymore.

424
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,311
Everything will be fine
as long as I find Kyeong Ran.

425
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:56,033
We have to go to the showroom
to take a look.

426
00:30:56,153 --> 00:30:58,439
There are documents I have to take care of.

427
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:10,347
<i>Is this Doctor Nam's apartment?</i>

428
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,675
The lights are turned
on in the apartment right now.

429
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:14,728
It seems she hasn't left yet.

430
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:18,474
She transferred the hospital today,
it seems she's about to leave.

431
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,207
Before that, you have to hand all
the evidence to the police.

432
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,021
Are you done with your treatment?

433
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:27,878
<i>I'm going to the hospital right now.</i>

434
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:32,720
What?

435
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:36,381
Shin Hyun Woo is in the hospital right now?

436
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,705
Shin Hyun Woo!

437
00:32:51,012 --> 00:32:53,171
That was clearly Shin Hyun Woo.

438
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:56,202
With a burn scar even.

439
00:32:58,974 --> 00:33:01,324
That was definitely Shin Hyun Woo,
no mistake.

440
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:03,694
Not Ahn Jae Sung.

441
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,265
I can't be completely sure.

442
00:33:20,385 --> 00:33:23,122
Shin Hyun Woo was sitting next to her.

443
00:33:23,673 --> 00:33:25,341
Just like at the villa,

444
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,579
it might be a model of Shin Hyun Woo.

445
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,839
I have to be careful.

446
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:41,643
Is this Korea Hospital?

447
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,141
I just wanted to check...

448
00:33:44,261 --> 00:33:46,553
was there a patient by the name
of Shin Hyun Woo?

449
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:52,732
He just left after being treated for burns?

450
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,828
I understand.

451
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,140
Then...

452
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,272
is it really Shin Hyun Woo?

453
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:23,704
Ah Ran.

454
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,069
When have you been home since?

455
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:36,460
Just now... Did you go out?

456
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,730
No.

457
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,409
I came home really early,
I've been home since.

458
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:53,016
The last time of entry, 6.20 p.m.

459
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,323
Then...

460
00:34:55,704 --> 00:34:58,942
<i>just now, that person was
really Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

461
00:35:02,249 --> 00:35:04,620
Why?
Is something the matter?

462
00:35:06,334 --> 00:35:09,466
Just sit down first,
you don't look so well,

463
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,693
I'll make you a hot cup of tea.

464
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:57,654
<i>That's right.</i>

465
00:35:57,774 --> 00:36:00,321
<i>He has identification cards and a passport,</i>

466
00:36:00,441 --> 00:36:02,670
<i>he can't be Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

467
00:36:10,671 --> 00:36:11,878
Jae Sung.

468
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,171
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:16,584
I must have been crazy.

470
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:18,996
I actually didn't believe you.

471
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,108
What kind of person are you to me?

472
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:25,181
Forgive me.

473
00:36:25,301 --> 00:36:27,911
I'll do anything to appease your anger.

474
00:36:55,118 --> 00:36:55,986
So...

475
00:36:56,106 --> 00:36:58,399
you saw me being captured on the CCTV,

476
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,896
and came to the conclusion
that I was Shin Hyun Woo.

477
00:37:01,016 --> 00:37:05,040
The two of you went on the same
day to the same bank, isn't that strange?

478
00:37:06,415 --> 00:37:11,029
That bank is close to our company,
so I'm a VIP there.

479
00:37:11,149 --> 00:37:14,248
I was too impulsive,
and I didn't think too much,

480
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,941
I'm really sorry.

481
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:22,620
Thinking about the fact that
Ah Ran doesn't trust me up till now,

482
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,461
it hurts me.

483
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,334
The reason why you can't trust me,
is my fault.

484
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,102
We'll hold the wedding as planned,
and then go together to America.

485
00:37:34,222 --> 00:37:38,229
The company matters are almost settled,
and I have nothing to hold on to here.

486
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:41,933
The reason for your sudden rush,
is it because of your ex-husband?

487
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:45,207
Is there a reason Shin
Hyun Woo shouldn't be alive?

488
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:49,122
That man...

489
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:52,076
won't quietly let me go.

490
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,123
Even though we're in the
process of getting a divorce,

491
00:37:55,243 --> 00:37:59,314
he'll grab me by my ankles,
and get in the way of my future happiness.

492
00:38:02,638 --> 00:38:04,204
From now on...

493
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:07,484
I want to be happy as the woman of one man.

494
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,842
Just like other people,
to fight as a couple over something small,

495
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:22,037
to birth a baby that looks like you,
and have him call me mum,

496
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,799
to go to the amusement park,

497
00:38:28,174 --> 00:38:30,735
to have water fights,

498
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:33,444
in a garden that has a
sign with our last name on it,

499
00:38:33,564 --> 00:38:35,623
I want to live like that.

500
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:41,778
If I could be greedy for things like that,

501
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:44,064
please don't abandon me.

502
00:38:54,388 --> 00:38:57,626
Now, the life that you're dreaming of,

503
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:01,287
is the married life, that I dreamt of once.

504
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:06,034
Even though I was trampled on by one woman.

505
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:17,632
Since it's a choice between life and death...

506
00:39:18,669 --> 00:39:21,505
you have to be happy.

507
00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,722
I only want one thing.

508
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:28,759
No matter who you're with...

509
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:32,103
as long as Ahjussi is content.

510
00:39:32,402 --> 00:39:34,603
I'm happy too.

511
00:39:57,238 --> 00:39:59,270
<i>Don't wait for me, go sleep first.</i>

512
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,746
<i>There's a lot to organize,
I'll sleep at the showroom tonight.</i>

513
00:40:02,866 --> 00:40:04,503
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

514
00:41:08,103 --> 00:41:10,474
<i>Joo Ah Ran,
it's been a long time.</i>

515
00:41:10,812 --> 00:41:12,527
<i>Have you been well?</i>

516
00:41:12,823 --> 00:41:15,723
<i>I came to this earth to see you now.</i>

517
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:18,157
<i>I'm looking forward to seeing you.</i>

518
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:21,479
<i>From, the Romeo who had his heart stolen.</i>

519
00:41:23,278 --> 00:41:25,879
The Romeo who had his heart stolen...

520
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:31,593
That was the nickname that
only I and Shin Hyun Woo knew.

521
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,515
What are you doing?

522
00:42:09,635 --> 00:42:11,017
Who are you?

523
00:42:11,137 --> 00:42:12,393
Who let you in?

524
00:42:12,513 --> 00:42:14,065
Who let you in?

525
00:42:16,727 --> 00:42:19,225
We inspected closely,
there's nothing special in particular.

526
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:22,547
However, there is quite a bit of male clothing,
and medicine to treat burns.

527
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:23,944
Is that so?

528
00:42:24,064 --> 00:42:25,990
I get it.
Go out first.

529
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,777
For a place where a girl stays by herself,
there's quite a lot of male clothing.

530
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:37,697
Antiseptic, sedatives,

531
00:42:38,988 --> 00:42:40,681
what are these?

532
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,040
Hurry and get out.

533
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,458
This is my house.

534
00:42:44,578 --> 00:42:46,511
You're still lying to me till the end.

535
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:51,717
You've been hiding Shin Hyun Woo,
and giving him treatment?

536
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,483
I have to go to work,
please let me through.

537
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,933
I saw it with my own eyes.

538
00:42:59,053 --> 00:43:01,493
You took Shin Hyun Woo from the hospital.

539
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,303
Where did you hide him,
what tricks are you trying to play?

540
00:43:06,748 --> 00:43:08,250
Now you know.

541
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:09,351
That's right.

542
00:43:09,471 --> 00:43:11,383
I love Shin Hyun Woo.

543
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:15,101
The person I love isn't President Ahn,
it's Shin Hyun Woo.

544
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:16,985
Is that so?

545
00:43:17,725 --> 00:43:19,821
To hide Shin Hyun Woo...

546
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:21,542
all this time, you've been pretending
to be in love with President Ahn?

547
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:24,484
Anyway, he's not a man you loved.

548
00:43:24,604 --> 00:43:27,574
What's wrong if I love him?

549
00:43:27,694 --> 00:43:29,321
Betrayed by his wife,

550
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:31,268
a car accident,
and a fire,

551
00:43:31,388 --> 00:43:33,921
that person's body and mind
are already riddled with bullet holes.

552
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,855
If I love him,
and care for him, what's so wrong with that?

553
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,120
If you like Shin Hyun Woo that much,

554
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,623
then the two of you should run away,
and live quietly like dead people.

555
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:43,316
Why did you come back?

556
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,559
Why do you want to force people
to their death?

557
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:47,295
Are you that scared?

558
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:50,110
Now, kneel in front of
that person and beg for mercy,

559
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:51,523
sincerely repent,

560
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:53,428
and say you were sincerely
accept the punishments for your sins!

561
00:43:56,582 --> 00:43:59,105
I don't have any thoughts of
begging for forgiveness from that person.

562
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:02,406
My wounds are still being ripped apart...

563
00:44:02,526 --> 00:44:05,539
what does that person's pain
have to do with me?

564
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:09,720
The way you look,
arrogant because you saved someone's life...

565
00:44:10,165 --> 00:44:12,514
there won't be a second time.

566
00:44:12,634 --> 00:44:14,525
God is fair.

567
00:44:21,387 --> 00:44:22,657
Ahjussi...

568
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,768
I'm fine.

569
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:28,964
I'm actually feeling refreshed.

570
00:44:29,905 --> 00:44:32,000
In front of Joo Ah Ran,

571
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,577
I could even say I like Ahjussi out loud.

572
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:39,026
It was good.

573
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:49,750
President!
Something big has happened!

574
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,985
President has sent an auditor,
to redo the last 6 months of sale figures.

575
00:44:54,105 --> 00:44:56,779
The sales section and the invoice
section has to be investigated.

576
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:58,384
What?

577
00:44:58,504 --> 00:45:00,246
Did people in the two sections
spout nonsense?

578
00:45:00,366 --> 00:45:02,617
No.
No one said anything to anyone.

579
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,193
I understand.
Go and work.

580
00:45:10,661 --> 00:45:13,117
That old fox might have suspected
something again.

581
00:45:13,237 --> 00:45:15,360
If Soul is not snatched away,

582
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,302
I can only transfer all
my assets to Jae Sung's name.

583
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,377
No...

584
00:45:22,075 --> 00:45:24,615
Care makes everything go smoothly.

585
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,832
Before that, I have to verify something.

586
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,349
If Jae Hee didn't help...

587
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:35,270
all my plans would have been ruined.

588
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,635
It's all because of
Ahjussi’s model of Shin Hyun Woo.

589
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:43,221
As planned, Joo Ah Ran even
called the Korea Hospital to verify it.

590
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:47,284
Luckily I asked a nurse I knew,
if not, we would have been in trouble.

591
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:50,878
Thank you.

592
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,883
Although it's hard, you understand me.

593
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,560
Please don't say that,
I'm actually sorry.

594
00:45:58,941 --> 00:46:04,171
Even though I know how Ahjussi
got to this step...

595
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:09,293
I was like a child, and only wanted
you to look at me, and throwing a tantrum.

596
00:46:11,885 --> 00:46:18,056
What I really wanted,
wasn't Soul Furniture, a house, or assets,

597
00:46:18,669 --> 00:46:24,014
and even though I know that damning Ah Ran,
won't change my life at all.

598
00:46:24,134 --> 00:46:25,475
But...

599
00:46:26,342 --> 00:46:29,919
I just want to comfort my broken spirit.

600
00:46:30,533 --> 00:46:35,151
To say, you did the right thing,
it wasn't you fault.

601
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:38,262
If not...

602
00:46:38,382 --> 00:46:41,479
I'm afraid I won't have hope
to continue living.

603
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:44,527
Wait and see...

604
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:48,604
the days when the bandages are taken off
Ahjussi’s heart, those days will definitely come.

605
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:49,705
Oh, right.

606
00:46:49,825 --> 00:46:53,451
What happened with the CCTV
that captured Ahjussi’s face?

607
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,137
I'm sorry,

608
00:47:02,257 --> 00:47:05,590
but could I take a look
at the CCTV I saw yesterday?

609
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:26,986
That's right.

610
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,774
Shin Hyun Woo and Ahn Jae
Sung are two different people.

611
00:47:31,642 --> 00:47:34,552
No matter how god-like
Shin Hyun Woo's hands are,

612
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:38,277
he can't create a person who
breathes and walks.

613
00:48:26,818 --> 00:48:28,405
Ah Ran, it's me.

614
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:32,321
Right now?

615
00:48:34,251 --> 00:48:36,198
Is it really alright?

616
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:38,082
We aren't even married yet...

617
00:48:38,202 --> 00:48:42,103
transferring all the assets under
your name to mine, will make you uneasy.

618
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,426
If you're not happy, let's not do it.

619
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,061
No.

620
00:48:47,887 --> 00:48:49,622
If we don't do this...

621
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:53,220
all of Soul's assets will
be stolen away by my in-laws.

622
00:48:54,193 --> 00:48:57,039
You don't know how greedy my
father-in-law is.

623
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:58,605
Then, in that case...

624
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:01,991
transferring the ownership of Pyeong Chang Dong,
and all of your brother-in-law's showrooms too,

625
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:04,002
isn't that a little too much?

626
00:49:04,122 --> 00:49:08,435
No matter what, you used to be a family too.

627
00:49:10,107 --> 00:49:11,588
Those people...

628
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,403
don't have the right to enjoy those assets.

629
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:17,239
Sucking people's blood
dry in order to get that wealth,

630
00:49:18,142 --> 00:49:20,448
of course they have to lose it this way.

631
00:49:21,464 --> 00:49:22,903
Alright.

632
00:49:23,023 --> 00:49:24,131
Then...

633
00:49:24,251 --> 00:49:26,247
the stock that I received from
President Joo,

634
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,782
I'll give to President Ahn.

635
00:49:28,902 --> 00:49:30,665
You've even transferred SM Furniture,

636
00:49:30,785 --> 00:49:33,226
what use is there if I keep it?

637
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:37,141
Thank you, Julie Jung.

638
00:49:37,261 --> 00:49:39,374
What's there to be thankful for?

639
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:43,141
Just treat it as compensation
for my brother Sang Mo's crimes.

640
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:45,766
Lawyer Lee,
the transfer documents,

641
00:49:45,886 --> 00:49:48,564
please don't make any mistakes,
and handle it detailed.

642
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,601
Yes.

643
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,977
For documents of these standard,

644
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:53,918
even if President Shin Woo Sub
files a lawsuit,

645
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:55,929
there will be no problem legally.

646
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,231
<i>Is Ah Ran really Joo Chul Ming's daughter?</i>

647
00:50:09,064 --> 00:50:11,604
<i>If she's that person's daughter,</i>

648
00:50:11,724 --> 00:50:14,059
<i>what else could she know?</i>

649
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:17,953
<i>If she knew everything,
and married into our family...</i>

650
00:51:06,216 --> 00:51:08,798
<i>That's a really happy family photo isn't it?</i>

651
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:11,993
You...

652
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:14,265
You...

653
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:22,244
That happiness,
who destroyed it?

654
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:25,146
Who is the person who killed Mum and Dad?

655
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,776
Was it Father-in-law?

656
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:31,157
Of course Mother-in-law
wouldn't know either.

657
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,913
All...

658
00:51:33,421 --> 00:51:35,492
Do you know all of it?

659
00:51:35,612 --> 00:51:37,630
Is that why you got close to our Hyun Woo?

660
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,450
- Is that so?
- That's right.

661
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:40,910
That was the case.

662
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,111
Then,
for the death of your parents...

663
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,892
you caused the death of our Hyun Woo?

664
00:51:45,012 --> 00:51:47,940
The traffic accident,
the fire at the villa, was that all planned?

665
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,797
At first, I didn't plan to kill Hyun Woo...

666
00:51:50,917 --> 00:51:53,548
but, I couldn't die because of Hyun Woo.

667
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:55,963
Hyun Woo dug his own grave.

668
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,354
If you hated us,
you should have killed us...

669
00:51:58,474 --> 00:51:59,963
why did you touch my son?!

670
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:02,968
Because, I wanted to take away
what was most precious to your family.

671
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:07,641
You want me to find your sister, right?

672
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:08,889
Alright.

673
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:11,344
Then, bring my son first.

674
00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:15,852
Don't bargain with my sister.

675
00:52:17,413 --> 00:52:19,381
She's a poor child who doesn't
know anything.

676
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:24,079
Where's my sister?

677
00:52:24,524 --> 00:52:27,996
If you have a shred of conscience,
give me my sister.

678
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:30,726
Before you find my son,
don't even think about getting anything!

679
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:34,430
<i>Now, I'll go to the police station, and tell them
you're the real culprit of the traffic accident.</i>

680
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,040
Then, find our Hyun Woo.

681
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,374
As long as you get your retribution,
I'll take my own payback!

682
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:50,454
No!

683
00:53:01,746 --> 00:53:02,846
No!

684
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:05,008
I'm about to leave with Jae Sung.

685
00:53:05,128 --> 00:53:07,357
I can't be caught by the police.

686
00:53:10,828 --> 00:53:13,177
It's me, Joo Seung.
Something big has happened.

687
00:53:13,297 --> 00:53:16,165
Persuade Mother,
Mother is on her way to the police station,

688
00:53:16,285 --> 00:53:19,191
she says she wants to tell them everything
about the traffic accident and the arson!

689
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:20,461
What?!

690
00:53:20,581 --> 00:53:23,614
I just want to be happy with you now.

691
00:53:23,734 --> 00:53:25,253
In order to get happiness for Dad and Mum,

692
00:53:25,373 --> 00:53:28,681
I can't even live,
expressing my love for you.

693
00:53:29,274 --> 00:53:32,829
Now, happiness is right in front of us,
we can't give up halfway.

694
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,761
Didn't I promise you?

695
00:53:34,881 --> 00:53:38,993
I'll protect you till the end,
and give you happiness.

696
00:53:40,327 --> 00:53:42,591
I'll meet Madam.

697
00:53:43,163 --> 00:53:44,792
You wait.

698
00:54:31,251 --> 00:54:34,023
If you're trying to help Ah Ran,
go back.

699
00:54:34,467 --> 00:54:36,922
I don't want to hear anything.

700
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:44,851
What are you doing right now?

701
00:54:44,971 --> 00:54:46,643
Get up immediately.

702
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:49,338
Although you've never treated me like a son,

703
00:54:50,205 --> 00:54:52,364
this is the first time,
and the last time,

704
00:54:52,484 --> 00:54:54,417
I'm begging you as a son.

705
00:54:54,537 --> 00:54:58,269
Ah Ran's crimes,
help me cover them.

706
00:54:58,735 --> 00:54:59,815
I can't do that.

707
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:02,249
It's not because of Ah Ran,

708
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,493
at least once in my life,

709
00:55:04,613 --> 00:55:07,752
I could be Madam's son
Just once!

710
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,167
For me...

711
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:12,283
Hyun Woos' grievances,

712
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:14,760
you could keep an eye shut.

713
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:17,342
For the son that was born illegitimately...

714
00:55:17,462 --> 00:55:19,289
is that a request that's too much too?

715
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:21,539
This is not a crime that can be covered up.

716
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:24,840
If we don't investigate Ah Ran's crimes...

717
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,973
Hyun Woo could never appear
in front of us again!

718
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:40,712
This photograph...

719
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,924
to me...

720
00:55:46,044 --> 00:55:48,336
is the only family photo I have.

721
00:55:49,246 --> 00:55:51,680
Although Madam denies it,

722
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:56,109
but to me,
you're my mother.

723
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:00,490
I...

724
00:56:01,294 --> 00:56:03,538
love AH Ran very much.

725
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:07,792
Even though the whole world
points and stares...

726
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:13,887
the heart that loves Ah Ran,
is bright and true.

727
00:56:16,024 --> 00:56:18,014
<i>Together with Ah Ran...</i>

728
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:22,733
I want to build a new family,
and live together..

729
00:56:24,428 --> 00:56:26,904
with no empty spaces as parents,

730
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,100
I want to live with the woman I love.

731
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,896
Is that impossible?

732
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:39,266
Hyun Woo Hyung is alive.

733
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:42,272
He's not far away.

734
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,002
I...

735
00:56:45,446 --> 00:56:47,859
will send him to Madam's side.

736
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:50,445
I promise.

737
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:54,804
Where's our Hyun Woo?

738
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:57,556
You know it?

739
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:28,354
Madam won't make things
hard for you anymore,

740
00:57:28,474 --> 00:57:30,259
don't worry.

741
00:57:30,379 --> 00:57:32,079
Even if that's the case,
you're still her son.

742
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:35,328
Once her heart softens, she loses to you.

743
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:37,565
I only got you some time temporarily.

744
00:57:37,685 --> 00:57:40,861
There are no secrets forever.

745
00:57:40,981 --> 00:57:43,548
Let's go to a new country
and forget the past,

746
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,749
start anew.

747
00:57:46,406 --> 00:57:49,058
Just like we've never been hurt before,

748
00:57:49,798 --> 00:57:54,137
and then,
fall in love all over again.

749
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:06,509
<i>Joo Seung.</i>

750
00:58:07,038 --> 00:58:15,070
<i>There isn't much time left
to spend with Joo Seung either.</i>

751
00:58:15,399 --> 00:58:22,848
<i>Joo Seung, for loving such
a woman like me, thank you.</i>

752
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,787
<i>I will occasionally think about you.</i>

753
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,090
What are you doing?

754
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:56,611
It's so dark,
yet you don't turn on the lights.

755
00:58:56,731 --> 00:58:58,135
Mum, you put up the Christmas tree so early?

756
00:58:58,255 --> 00:58:59,531
Honey...

757
00:59:00,314 --> 00:59:02,092
our Hyun Woo was here.

758
00:59:02,212 --> 00:59:04,008
It must be our Hyun Woo.

759
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:07,351
Look at the paper doll,
that's Hyun Woo's art.

760
00:59:08,029 --> 00:59:09,828
Is it real?

761
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:14,303
This tree,
did Hyun Woo Oppa make it before leaving?

762
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:15,425
Yes.

763
00:59:15,545 --> 00:59:19,530
Oppa is still alive, and is thinking of us,
that's why he came secretly.

764
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,372
He hasn't forgotten us.

765
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:23,780
Hyun Woo, this kid.

766
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,366
He's clearly by our side,
yet he's not returning.

767
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:32,091
It must be for something serious.

768
01:00:02,644 --> 01:00:04,740
President, something big has happened.

769
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:06,327
<i>What is it?</i>

770
01:00:06,447 --> 01:00:08,778
According to your instructions, we
inspected the showrooms of your daughter-in-law.

771
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:11,423
We found these documents.

772
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:16,593
What is this?

773
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:20,254
The transfer documents for Soul Furniture.

774
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,297
Who's transferring Soul Furniture?!

775
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,530
<i>Hyun Woo's stocks,</i>

776
01:00:27,335 --> 01:00:29,515
and the house at Pyeong Chang Dong,

777
01:00:29,635 --> 01:00:31,948
and Hyun Min's showrooms.

778
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:34,869
How can that be?!

779
01:00:40,638 --> 01:00:42,056
What is it?

780
01:00:43,813 --> 01:00:48,037
Maybe Father-in-law knows that
I've transferred my assets over to Jae Sung.

781
01:00:49,645 --> 01:00:51,106
Looks like...

782
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:54,217
I'll have to stay here tonight.

783
01:00:56,643 --> 01:00:57,828
Let's just do that.

784
01:00:57,948 --> 01:01:01,680
If possible,
you can stay here before the wedding.

785
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,881
Really?

786
01:01:05,447 --> 01:01:07,987
Anyway, I don't have to go to
the company anymore...

787
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,753
so I'll just stay here,
and prepare for the wedding.

788
01:01:12,721 --> 01:01:13,779
But...

789
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:16,912
when are your parents and
siblings coming from America?

790
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:18,986
The wedding is tomorrow.

791
01:01:19,685 --> 01:01:22,330
On the day of the wedding,
I think they'll go straight to the church.

792
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,145
They don't seem t be very free,
because of their work.

793
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,510
So, they can only greet you in the church.

794
01:01:35,466 --> 01:01:37,181
<i>What a miracle.</i>

795
01:01:37,776 --> 01:01:40,696
If people say the same thing with
the same mouth,

796
01:01:40,816 --> 01:01:42,813
it might come true.

797
01:01:43,405 --> 01:01:46,821
Who knew I would live in America.

798
01:01:47,625 --> 01:01:50,123
I'm so touched...

799
01:01:50,243 --> 01:01:52,959
and I'm anticipating,
our new married life.

800
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:24,161
Jae Sung really...

801
01:02:24,281 --> 01:02:27,420
When did he put this here?

802
01:02:35,153 --> 01:02:37,418
<i>The Juliet that steals heart.</i>

803
01:02:37,538 --> 01:02:40,034
<i>You're leaving without even seeing me?</i>

804
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:41,685
<i>Wait a little longer.</i>

805
01:02:41,805 --> 01:02:43,928
<i>We'll meet again.</i>

806
01:02:44,224 --> 01:02:47,716
<i>I really want to see how
you look in a wedding dress.</i>

807
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,939
It clearly says...

808
01:03:09,512 --> 01:03:12,433
the only I crime I have,
is that I tried very hard to run the company.

809
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:15,607
I'm sorry that things turned out this way.

810
01:03:15,727 --> 01:03:17,279
Don't lie.

811
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:22,502
The two of you planned
to take over the company, right?

812
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:25,105
<i>You're looking at the wrong person.</i>

813
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:27,497
Is that how you do business?

814
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,116
You use the resort as an excuse
to get closer,

815
01:03:31,236 --> 01:03:33,847
and what have you prepared for this thing?

816
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:38,101
I, only used legitimate methods
to take over Soul and the house.

817
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:41,912
Here

818
01:03:42,426 --> 01:03:44,965
These are the details of my
investment in Soul.

819
01:03:50,129 --> 01:03:51,928
This is ridiculous.

820
01:03:52,048 --> 01:03:55,595
Toads,
also go toward the light.

821
01:03:55,715 --> 01:03:57,839
How could you take the entirety
of someone else's assets,

822
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:00,019
and take it over in one morning?

823
01:04:00,139 --> 01:04:01,310
<i>Return me my company!</i>

824
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,622
<i>I can never give you my company.</i>

825
01:04:03,742 --> 01:04:09,548
Before my son comes back,
he has to die in that house!

826
01:04:09,865 --> 01:04:11,632
<i>Dad, are you alright?</i>

827
01:04:11,752 --> 01:04:13,812
<i>Dad, calm down!</i>

828
01:04:17,137 --> 01:04:20,015
You should send him to the hospital.

829
01:04:27,701 --> 01:04:29,352
As your request...

830
01:04:30,114 --> 01:04:33,352
if you want to leave with Joo Seung,
do that.

831
01:04:34,008 --> 01:04:36,759
What a charitable act.

832
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:39,735
But...

833
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:43,608
give the house,
and Hyun Min's showrooms back to us.

834
01:04:45,237 --> 01:04:46,507
No.

835
01:04:47,858 --> 01:04:50,482
The house, the company,
the showrooms...

836
01:04:50,602 --> 01:04:53,424
I can't return you a single one.

837
01:04:55,329 --> 01:04:58,377
A family built on blood, will
end with blood.

838
01:04:59,222 --> 01:05:01,783
The crime of trampling on our
family for money...

839
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,365
you have to pay it back with money.

840
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,504
<i>That's fair, don't you think?</i>

841
01:05:07,024 --> 01:05:10,015
Do you know what it is like,
living on the streets because we had no money,

842
01:05:10,135 --> 01:05:12,550
that lonely and pathetic life?!

843
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:15,937
It cuts to the bone, doesn't it.

844
01:05:25,006 --> 01:05:27,348
If you hand over our Kyeong Ran...

845
01:05:27,835 --> 01:05:30,523
I might consider returning you the house.

846
01:05:44,403 --> 01:05:48,001
<i>The Shin Woo Sub who only
graduated from elementary school,</i>

847
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:50,674
<i>fought for money to buy this house.</i>

848
01:05:50,794 --> 01:05:54,441
<i>Dad, after I'm married, I want to
stay with my wife and children in this house.</i>

849
01:05:54,561 --> 01:05:58,335
<i>How can that be?
I want to stay here with my children too!</i>

850
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,747
<i>Then, isn't it alright if we
all stay together?</i>

851
01:06:00,867 --> 01:06:02,864
<i>Should we build another floor?</i>

852
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,411
Director.

853
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,591
I'm Hyun Woo's mother.

854
01:06:16,711 --> 01:06:18,262
Kyeong Ran...

855
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:20,841
No,
Jae Hee...

856
01:06:22,026 --> 01:06:23,973
Her sister wants to see her.

857
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:26,280
Can you contact her for me?

858
01:06:40,235 --> 01:06:41,505
Hello.

859
01:06:41,907 --> 01:06:42,880
Mother.

860
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,103
Hello,

861
01:06:45,223 --> 01:06:46,436
this is...

862
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:48,646
Mother..

863
01:06:49,578 --> 01:06:50,953
I'm Hyun Woo.

864
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:55,990
Hyun Woo?

865
01:06:56,689 --> 01:06:58,615
Are you really Hyun Woo?

866
01:06:59,704 --> 01:07:00,804
Yes, Mother.

867
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:04,190
It's Hyun Woo.

873
01:07:15,106 --> 01:07:17,229
<i>In the end, you want to kill me right?</i>

874
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:18,880
<i>If the law,
the world is all on Father-in-law's side,</i>

875
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,555
<i>I will trample this world.</i>

876
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:22,989
<i>I'm so happy, yet I keep shedding tears.</i>

877
01:07:23,109 --> 01:07:24,979
I'm so in love with you.

878
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:28,217
What kind of betrayal that was,
I will let you feel it in your bones.

879
01:07:28,337 --> 01:07:29,775
<i>Marrying Joo Ah Ran,</i>

880
01:07:29,895 --> 01:07:31,260
<i>does that make sense?</i>

881
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,287
<i>Is that what Ah Ran really is?</i>

882
01:07:34,407 --> 01:07:35,320
Where is Shin Hyun Woo!

883
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:36,636
Come out immediately!

884
01:07:36,756 --> 01:07:39,079
Don't meddle in other people's business.
Don't show your face again!

885
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:41,830
Joo Ah Ran,
did you really kill Shin Hyun Woo?

886
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:43,545
It's all a lie!

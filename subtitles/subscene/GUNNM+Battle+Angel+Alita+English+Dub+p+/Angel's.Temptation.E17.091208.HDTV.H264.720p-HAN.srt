00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,995
Temptation Of An Angel 

3
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:07,984
Episode 17

4
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:17,485
Hello?

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,015
Mother.

6
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,296
Hello? Who...?

7
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:27,015
Mother, it's Hyun Woo.

8
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:34,518
Hyun Woo? Is it really you, Hyun Woo?

9
00:00:35,762 --> 00:00:40,218
Yes, Mother. It's Hyun Woo.

10
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:42,300
Are you really Hyun Woo?

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,304
My son, Hyun Woo?

12
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,452
Yes.

13
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:48,001
Where are you right now?

14
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:50,231
Tell me where you are,
I'll go pick you up right now.

15
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,684
Why didn't you come back if
you were still alive?

16
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:57,152
Just wait for a while. Then,
we'll be able to meet.

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,733
I'll call again.

18
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:05,779
Hyun Woo? Hyun Woo!

19
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:11,154
There's no mistake, it's my son Hyun Woo.

20
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,158
My son Hyun Woo is still alive!

21
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:27,996
It's me.

22
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:30,478
Attorney Lee just came by.

23
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,716
The Yang Pyeong villa under Joo Ah Ran

24
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,967
was transferred to Nam Joo Seung,
did you know?

25
00:01:36,087 --> 00:01:38,340
What? To Nam Joo Seung?

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,626
All of the other assets were
transferred to you,

27
00:01:41,746 --> 00:01:46,215
but the Yang Pyeong villa was transferred
to Nam Joo Seung. I'm surprised.

28
00:01:47,337 --> 00:01:50,356
Is it some kind of settlement for a man that she has
taken advantage of, then thrown away?

29
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,996
That's not possible. No matter what reason,

30
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:55,167
Nam Joo Seung has no right to the
Yang Pyeong villa.

31
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:57,844
Although it all burned up...

32
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,750
it has evidence to prove two
people's evil actions.

33
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:05,512
No matter what, I will get it back.

34
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:11,885
Nam Joo Seung.

35
00:02:12,689 --> 00:02:16,073
Do you also want to hurt my parents? [? He says something like his parents being stabbed in the heart]

36
00:02:17,364 --> 00:02:18,887
What is betrayal?

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,458
I will let you feel what it means
to be betrayed.

38
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:37,761
<i>Last year in October, the beautiful medical
director Nam Joo Seung,</i>

39
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:40,244
<i>placed car accident patient Shin Hyun Woo</i>

40
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:43,637
<i>in the Yang Pyeong villa
without any medical attention</i>

41
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:46,682
<i>The patient's guardians were led to believe in a
medical treatment which was in fact non-existent.</i>

42
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:50,560
<i>Not only that, it has been proven that he hired a
foreigner that didn't have a medical license,</i>

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,847
<i>and directed him to provide
the medical care.</i>

44
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:58,530
<i>For such unmoral behavior, Nam Joo Seung's
license should be taken away.</i>

45
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,520
We're finally leaving tomorrow.

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,617
Are you going to drive a knife into
my parents' hearts too?

47
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:10,619
It's not uncomfortable. Don't worry.

48
00:03:14,551 --> 00:03:16,270
Here are some information
about Design School.

49
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,625
After you get to America,

50
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,348
study furniture design more formally.

51
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:22,344
Like your dream,
you get a degree, find a job

52
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,562
and become a real furniture designer.

53
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,285
I will help you.

54
00:03:26,698 --> 00:03:30,394
Me... study design?

55
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:32,259
It's not something that's impossible.

56
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:36,207
Every day, after getting up,
pack a lunch box and go to the library.

57
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:40,416
You'll learn linguistics,
then go to Design School.

58
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:45,023
I'll get a new medical license in America,
then go into neurology.

59
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:49,803
Like that. Then you'll give birth to a baby that
is half like you and half like me.

60
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:52,348
Think about it,
isn't that such a happy image?

61
00:03:56,652 --> 00:04:02,333
<i>Joo Seung, the image you have
of us together, give up on it.</i>

62
00:04:03,741 --> 00:04:05,429
<i>Right now, my heart...</i>

63
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,913
<i>is filled with thoughts about Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

64
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:10,618
<i>I love that man.</i>

65
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,789
<i>If it's because of that person...</i>

66
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>I can even forget revenge.</i>

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,865
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

68
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:22,379
I have a present to give you, too.

69
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:27,264
The Yang Pyeong villa that had my all,

70
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,092
was transferred to you today.

71
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:34,210
You are also your mother's son.

72
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:36,748
You have the right to accept these.

73
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:40,264
A villa in Korea is useless.

74
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:42,453
And, I don't need this.

75
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,983
Even so, you should accept these.
Who knows what will happen?

76
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:55,778
Director,
something of yours came by courier.

77
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,783
The sender was Shin Hyun Woo.

78
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,447
What? Our Hyun Woo?

79
00:05:10,318 --> 00:05:11,918
What is this?

80
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:15,746
How could Joo Seung do something like this?

81
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:20,089
Secretary Kang.

82
00:05:20,209 --> 00:05:20,998
Yes, President.

83
00:05:21,118 --> 00:05:25,305
Go and get the records from when I was wrongly
hospitalized and a doctor's confirmation.

84
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:28,729
I was going to protect him to the end...

85
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,949
but now I can't put up with him anymore.

86
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:39,885
Why did you come to the hospital?

87
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,089
If you needed help,
you should have called me.

88
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,058
I only came because I have good news.

89
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,776
I heard your sister was looking for you.

90
00:05:47,963 --> 00:05:52,728
My sister? Is this true?

91
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,418
I knew you would be happy,
I came when I got the news.

92
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:58,479
I'll try to set up a meeting for tomorrow,
so go and meet her.

93
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:04,209
Sister. My sister didn't forget me?

94
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:10,838
Where was she? Why did she only come now?
I missed her so much.

95
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,796
It's still a relief that you
can meet her now.

96
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,450
Before, I didn't know...

97
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,722
but I heard you real name was Kyung Ran.

98
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:24,854
Kyung Ran?
My original name is not Yoon Jae Hee?

99
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,152
Jae Hee was a name I came up for you.

100
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:31,072
Oh yeah,
you still have those red shoes, right?

101
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:35,683
Of course. It's the only thing that can
help me find my family.

102
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:38,511
When you go see your sister,
you have to bring them.

103
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,800
Your sister probably still remembers them.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,521
I know, Director. Please make it so we
meet as soon as possible.

105
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,622
I'm fine with any time.

106
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:52,619
Kyung Ran. Kyung Ran.

107
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:41,926
So it's like this. Shin Hyun Woo
and Yoon Jae Hee

108
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,961
have known each other since the orphanage.

109
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:49,051
So that's why Yoon Jae Hee is helping
Shin Hyun Woo with the revenge.

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,257
What's the matter?
Why are in a department store?

111
00:07:55,795 --> 00:08:00,314
Tomorrow is the wedding, and I feel bad that I
haven't bought you anything.

112
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,718
Tomorrow when your parents come,
they won't dislike me, right?

113
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:07,925
This is not quite it.

114
00:08:28,144 --> 00:08:30,598
Jae Sung, look at this.

115
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,112
It's beautiful, isn't it?

116
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:38,671
I want to give birth to a son that looks
exactly like you. What about you?

117
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,924
<i>Pregnant?
I'm pregnant with Shin Hyun Woo's child?</i>

118
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:45,756
<i>Every time I think about how I carry
Shin Hyun Woo's child,</i>

119
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,958
<i>I feel more disgusted than when I have
snakes crawling all over my body.</i>

120
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:56,236
Let's wait to have a child.
There isn't enough time to love you.

121
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,888
If it's okay, can we go see my parents?

122
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:09,655
After we get married,
we won't have much time to visit.

123
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,054
I want them to see their son-in-law.

124
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,207
Parents?

125
00:09:32,402 --> 00:09:35,921
Mom...
Dad...

126
00:09:39,183 --> 00:09:43,340
When they're in a good mood,
they would've had a drink.

127
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,916
Today, please drink as much as you want.

128
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:55,810
Dad. I'm getting married.

129
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,977
I've met a good person that
I'm getting married to.

130
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,606
So, don't worry about me now.

131
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:10,731
We'll find Kyung Ran too.

132
00:10:12,731 --> 00:10:14,853
Today, I will fulfill...

133
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:18,148
the promise I made to the both of you.

134
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:25,139
Please rest in peace now.

135
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,143
Looks like there is a heartbreaking
story behind this.

136
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,591
How did your parents pass away?

137
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:39,195
In the company that they've worked
for their whole lives...

138
00:10:40,143 --> 00:10:43,309
they told the truth and wrongly died.

139
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:48,740
<i>It was made so it looked like it accident.
But it was a planned murder.</i>

140
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,294
To save Dad...

141
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,577
my mom also passed away on the same day.

142
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,305
Is that the truth?

143
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,728
If both of them passed away,

144
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,991
the truth is unknown.

145
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,163
How did you know?

146
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:11,679
After entering the tiger's den,
I saw it with my own eyes.

147
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:19,447
They also took away my poor little sister.

148
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,320
Sister?

149
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:29,304
Although we haven't seen each
other in 25 years,

150
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:33,195
I haven't forgotten her for even a day.

151
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,054
Tomorrow, before leaving...

152
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,990
I must find and meet her.

153
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:45,999
What is the company your parents worked for?

154
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,601
If it's that kind of evil business,

155
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:50,830
I think it's best if I remember it.

156
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,444
It's at a place that you know.

157
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:01,538
It's at...

158
00:12:03,878 --> 00:12:05,240
Wait a second.

159
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,014
It's me. Is it ready?

160
00:12:18,417 --> 00:12:20,930
Alright. I'm leaving now.

161
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:27,272
Sorry. Something urgent came up
and I have to go now.

162
00:12:36,469 --> 00:12:39,820
Made it look like an accident,
but was murder...?

163
00:12:42,825 --> 00:12:44,849
It definitely was our Hyun Woo.

164
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:46,896
His voice changed a little,

165
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,553
but it's the same warm tone.

166
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:50,111
It's definitely Hyun Woo, no mistake.

167
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:52,326
Yes. It's Hyun Woo.

168
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,382
He sent me this today.

169
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:00,459
What is this?

170
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,506
Request to invalidate
Nam Joo Seung's license...?

171
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:07,727
Our Hyun Woo...

172
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,419
knew all about the things Joo Seung
was doing in the Villa.

173
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,146
Although he was lying with his eyes closed,
he wasn't sleeping.

174
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,945
<i>Hyun Woo really woke up?</i>

175
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:18,099
But sister-in-law didn't tell us.

176
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,809
<i>How can we just let it go like this?
How could she have done that?</i>

177
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,809
No, what is this?

178
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,505
Why is the Yang Pyeon villa under
Doctor Nam's name?

179
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:28,158
He even stole Hyun Woo's wife,
what can't he steal?

180
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:31,552
Look at Hyun Woo,
telling us what Joo Seung did.

181
00:13:31,672 --> 00:13:33,709
He's telling us to not forgive what
Joo Seung did.

182
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:37,906
And, the last time he messed
with my medical records.

183
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,747
We should use this chance to make
him take off his doctor's coat.

184
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:41,976
<i>-Honey...
-Our Hyun Woo is coming back.</i>

185
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:45,020
If it's like this, will he forgive his
wife and Joo Seung?

186
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,261
This family and the company will come
back to the original place,

187
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:49,158
so I'm not worried about anything.

188
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,676
Director. Something big happened.
We must go back to the company and see.

189
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,753
Why, what is it?

190
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:57,668
The shareholders came to the company...

191
00:13:57,788 --> 00:13:59,565
and are requesting for you to be
dismissed from your position.

192
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:02,741
What?

193
00:14:09,204 --> 00:14:12,062
<i>You went behind our backs and sold
the company. Is that true?</i>

194
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:16,613
The news about Soul collapsing
is traveling everywhere,

195
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:17,785
<i>how do you explain that?</i>

196
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,033
Everyone, don't be like this.

197
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,310
Director, let's get away from here.

198
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,246
<i>Your son died, but you still haven't
reported his death yet.</i>

199
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,554
You unmoral jerk!

200
00:14:28,674 --> 00:14:31,578
You must immediately transfer your
position to someone else...

201
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:34,860
<i>and save the company even if it means selling yourself!
You jerk, do you understand?</i>

202
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,828
Our SOUL didn't die!

203
00:14:37,597 --> 00:14:39,451
I will be responsible for reviving
the company.

204
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:44,686
Just you wait! My son is still alive!

205
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:49,908
I, Shin Woo Sub,
absolutely will not lose. Ever!

206
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:08,562
<i>You're Shin Hyun Min, right?</i>

207
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,365
Yes. What is it?

208
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:13,876
The leadership power has been changed.

209
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,304
If you don't move out soon...

210
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:17,216
we'll have to force you to.

211
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:21,076
Stop all business.
We'll have to repossess your furniture too.

212
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:23,527
What? Repossess?

213
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,879
- Let's start.
- Yes.

214
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,214
Nam Joo Seung finalized everything
with the hospital, right?

215
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:38,076
Yes. He said he's going to America tomorrow.

216
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:40,116
It's like he hasn't even dreamed that

217
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,957
Joo Ah Ran is getting married.

218
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:46,731
But everything will be revealed tomorrow.

219
00:15:47,806 --> 00:15:50,123
What exactly are you thinking of?

220
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:52,562
My heart can't rest and it's
driving me crazy.

221
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,293
If Joo Ah Ran find out who you are today,

222
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,121
the wedding will be ruined.

223
00:15:57,369 --> 00:15:59,998
You don't know what
Director Nam is going to do.

224
00:16:02,623 --> 00:16:04,967
There hasn't been a moment
where there isn't danger.

225
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,807
Life is about choosing.

226
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,137
Once you've made your choice,
you cannot be afraid.

227
00:16:11,936 --> 00:16:14,840
I want to stand up from where I've fallen.

228
00:16:16,913 --> 00:16:19,622
If the thing that went wrong
in my life was marriage...

229
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:24,692
I should go back,
and start anew from there, right?

230
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:27,624
I believe in you.

231
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:31,920
When you were Shin Hyun Woo,
or Ahn Jae Sung...

232
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,683
even when you're going to be Joo Ah Ran's
husband tomorrow,

233
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:36,762
my heart will remain the same.

234
00:16:36,882 --> 00:16:39,120
It will stay here, and wait for you.

235
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,482
Do just as we planned. Do it well.

236
00:16:56,927 --> 00:17:01,074
Let them be scared. Don't hold back.

237
00:17:01,451 --> 00:17:03,549
They will reap what they have sown.

238
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,261
Please don't worry.

239
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,230
This house belongs to Ahn Jae Sung, right?

240
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:21,732
So why are you still here
and not moving out?

241
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,258
What are you going to do?

242
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:24,916
We never sold this house.

243
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:26,207
This is fraud!

244
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:30,730
Fraud? This house was bought with money.
How is this fraud?

245
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:34,718
While I'm being nice, hurry up,
pack your bags and get out.

246
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,942
You guys. Did this guy called Ahn Jae Sung
tell you to come here?

247
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,009
That jerk.

248
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,193
This is our house.

249
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:42,213
Before I call the cops, get out.

250
00:17:42,457 --> 00:17:47,510
Cops? If the cops come,
you will be the one they usher out.

251
00:17:48,016 --> 00:17:49,166
Come. Let's start.

252
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:54,239
Why are you being like this?

253
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,182
It's not like we can move right away.
Why are you like this?

254
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,213
Okay. I got it. I'll be right there.
Take care of your mom and sister.

255
00:18:02,592 --> 00:18:04,666
I said that I'll take care of it!

256
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,478
What is this? Where's my car?

257
00:18:09,598 --> 00:18:12,448
Oh that. The shareholders took it...

258
00:18:12,568 --> 00:18:14,121
along with your corporate credit cards.

259
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,067
What?

260
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:21,746
They all want me to die.

261
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:26,368
I've worn out my shoes working so hard to
line the pockets of these people,

262
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:30,653
and they are kicking me out the moment
the company hits an obstacle?

263
00:18:31,648 --> 00:18:33,498
These worthless jerks.

264
00:19:03,615 --> 00:19:05,747
Get out. Get out.

265
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,226
What are you doing?

266
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,389
There had been no notice,
why do we have to move out?

267
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:16,844
Who told you to force us to get out?

268
00:19:16,964 --> 00:19:18,963
Who sent you guys,

269
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,888
Ahn Jae Sung or Joo Ah Ran?

270
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,319
They were sent by me.
What are you going to do?

271
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:28,224
Oh right. It's you.

272
00:19:28,444 --> 00:19:31,287
You want me to die, don't you?

273
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,146
You're using these ways to
get my family fortune...

274
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:36,463
and so planned for Hyun Woo to
have an accident, right?

275
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,224
What evidence do you have?

276
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,817
Don't be too proud.

277
00:19:39,937 --> 00:19:42,037
Someday, the truth will be revealed.

278
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:44,928
There's no such thing as a perfect crime.

279
00:19:45,048 --> 00:19:46,911
I'm the one that should have said that.

280
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,677
Through the passage of time...

281
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:52,005
did you think that your crimes
will disappear?

282
00:19:52,444 --> 00:19:55,163
Did you think that the grudge of other
people will be so easily forgotten?

283
00:19:55,421 --> 00:19:58,851
No. Even if the person died...

284
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:00,773
crime will not rot away.

285
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:03,021
Because of your actions,
a family has been stomped over.

286
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:05,318
While you've had enough to eat...

287
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:08,218
someone else was thinking about death.

288
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,616
Law and this world is all on your side.

289
00:20:10,736 --> 00:20:12,551
I will step on that world until
it is crushed.

290
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:16,584
What crime have I committed? Let me hear it.

291
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:18,551
Why did you turn me into a criminal?

292
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,651
Even though we were poor,
I could have grown up in my parents' love.

293
00:20:25,804 --> 00:20:28,005
Why did you turn me into
this poisonous child?

294
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,506
Because of the hurt you gave me...

295
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,666
my whole being is filled me poison.

296
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:34,605
Why don't you know?

297
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:39,218
Don't say anymore. We don't have anything
else that can be lost or stolen.

298
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:43,144
What you've done is enough.
What do we still have?

299
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:46,474
<i>Why are you pleading with such a person?</i>

300
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:50,535
Looks like you're just saying stuff
to cover up your own crime.

301
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:52,407
After our Hyun Woo comes back...

302
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:55,591
you're the one that'll be dragged
to the police station.

303
00:20:57,187 --> 00:21:01,753
Really? Thanks for caring about me.

304
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:06,979
I think you should worry about where your
family's going to sleep tonight.

305
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:12,374
Lock the door properly. Don't let anyone in.

306
00:21:24,267 --> 00:21:26,145
If you've lived your life right...

307
00:21:26,664 --> 00:21:29,146
you should be able to find a friend
who can lend you a room.

308
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:50,747
Dad. Dad, don't be like this.

309
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:53,413
Dad. Dad, calm down.

310
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:12,969
<i>Father.</i>

311
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,661
How much did you love her,
if you've served her as the Director's wife.

312
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:20,830
and then left?

313
00:22:22,523 --> 00:22:24,546
<i>I won't live like you.</i>

314
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,553
If I like it, I will fight for it.

315
00:22:26,673 --> 00:22:28,922
Love will always remain on my side.

316
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,833
I won't let my woman

317
00:22:32,631 --> 00:22:34,861
live as someone else's woman anymore.

318
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:10,680
Yes, hello?

319
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,496
The Medical Association?

320
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,584
What did you say?

321
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,632
What are you doing right now?

322
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:38,153
What are you doing in someone else's office?

323
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:43,569
We've received information about how
you were conducting malpractice.

324
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:48,100
We've also received information about how you
intentionally gave out false prescriptions.

325
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,461
Per request,
the Medical Association will investigate.

326
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:57,126
Who submitted the request?

327
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:59,350
Someone named Shin Hyun Woo.

328
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,303
It's a patient of yours, right?

329
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:08,272
Shin Hyun Woo?

330
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:11,838
After investigation,
not only is there medical punishment,

331
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:14,702
but also law punishments. Do you understand?

332
00:24:28,864 --> 00:24:33,068
You can take them all away,
I'll never come back here.

333
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:36,373
As long as I get to leave with Ah Ran,

334
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:38,089
the physician's license is nothing.

335
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:40,871
With my abilities, I can give it up.

336
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:54,028
<i>You've worked hard during this time.</i>

337
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:58,647
<i>If I hurt you, please forgive me.
Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

338
00:25:00,572 --> 00:25:02,220
What are you thinking about doing?

339
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,542
Because of your stubbornness,

340
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:08,201
your whole family has to sleep on the streets.
Does that feel good?

341
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:12,123
Are you still unwilling to hand
over Kyung Ran?

342
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:15,879
<i>Alright, I'll bring Kyung Ran over tomorrow.</i>

343
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:19,399
<i>So please return the house to us.</i>

344
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:21,003
<i>Regarding whose daughter you are...</i>

345
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:22,869
<i>please keep it a secret from
Hyun Woo's Dad until the end.</i>

346
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,878
Then, we will discuss this after
I meet with Kyung Ran.

347
00:25:36,641 --> 00:25:38,941
Tomorrow, you will be contacted
by my mother-in-law.

348
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,993
They've been scared,
so they'll have to show us Kyung Ran.

349
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,779
Really? So everything is settled now?

350
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:52,743
But I'm busy tomorrow, so I will not be
able to make it on time tomorrow.

351
00:25:53,025 --> 00:25:56,957
Please make sure you hold Kyung Ran there,
and wait for me.

352
00:25:58,447 --> 00:26:00,213
If this completes without mistake,

353
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,166
I will transfer the furniture store
over to you as promised.

354
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:09,257
Don't worry about it.
Our nickname is Jinduk dog!

355
00:26:09,377 --> 00:26:12,555
Once we grab onto it,
we definitely will not let go.

356
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:18,148
Director, what brings you here?

357
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,007
You've worked hard these days,
and I haven't had time to properly thank you.

358
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,560
This is a handbag, I hope you like it.

359
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:30,897
You don't need to be like this. Thanks.

360
00:26:31,017 --> 00:26:36,872
Live a good life. You were a good person.

361
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:53,849
That...

362
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,874
What is it?

363
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:06,553
<i>If Yoon Jae Hee was the one Madam
supported at the Angel Orphanage,</i>

364
00:27:06,912 --> 00:27:10,177
<i>then, is Yoon Jae Hee Kyung Ran?</i>

365
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,585
Why did it become like this?

366
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,646
The sister that Ah Ran's been looking for,

367
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,874
it's Yoon Jae Hee?

368
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:36,477
How did it become like this?

369
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:40,637
The sister Ah Ran wanted to see,

370
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,287
why did it have to be...?

371
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:48,423
Even if you have no appetite, eat something.

372
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,943
The situation is already like this,
did you think I'd be able to swallow food, like pigs?

373
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,563
The family fortune I've put my whole life
towards with blood and sweat...

374
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:56,843
is just going to fly away like that.

375
00:27:57,178 --> 00:27:59,220
Mom doesn't look so good.

376
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,790
She needs to go lie down somewhere.

377
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,987
How about going to my store?

378
00:28:04,262 --> 00:28:06,387
Even though it's closed at the moment,

379
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:08,328
it's still a warm place to lie down.

380
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:09,744
Let's just live there.

381
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,797
<i>How can we sleep at a store?</i>

382
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:14,297
Before getting our house back,
let's make a reservation at a hotel.

383
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:18,840
Did you think that Shin Woo Sup
can't come up with that much money?

384
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:28,986
President Park, I have something urgent,

385
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,531
so can you lend me some money?
I'll pay you back.

386
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:36,639
What?

387
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:38,670
Ownership issue?

388
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:41,742
Who is it that is spreading those rumors?

389
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:43,605
If you don't want to lend me money,
then fine.

390
00:28:56,948 --> 00:28:59,140
Yoon Jae. What are you doing here?

391
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,719
Director, something big happened!

392
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,448
Just now Ah Ran came here,
and changed the lock on the store.

393
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:08,997
She said that the store's owner is going to change,
and asked me not to come anymore.

394
00:29:09,117 --> 00:29:10,558
I tried to convince her.
That inconsiderate jerk.

395
00:29:10,678 --> 00:29:14,537
What? We can't go into the store anymore?

396
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:18,140
I'm so ashamed. My whole life

397
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,476
I never that that there'd be a
day when I was poor.

398
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,734
<i>What's the use of living?</i>

399
00:29:22,854 --> 00:29:25,129
Let's just all die together. Die.

400
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:29,964
Mom! Stay strong, mom!

401
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:32,100
This won't do. Help mom into the car.

402
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:39,094
She wanted to find her sister so much,

403
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,700
so I should tell her, right?

404
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:53,907
No. If I tell her now,

405
00:29:54,694 --> 00:29:56,971
both of them will get hurt.

406
00:29:58,133 --> 00:30:01,265
One person is the person Hyun Woo
wants to get revenge on.

407
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:06,023
Another person is the person helping
Hyun Woo get his revenge.

408
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:29,170
This coffee house.
Why doesn't it have any other people?

409
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:32,278
Today, I reserved the whole store.

410
00:30:33,694 --> 00:30:36,013
Today is the last day of our single lives.

411
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,023
We should celebrate it.

412
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:44,846
I specially told them to make it like that.
Do you like the mood?

413
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:47,200
Excellent.

414
00:30:48,189 --> 00:30:51,485
The you under candlelight is more beautiful.

415
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:55,842
Can I borrow your hand for a second?

416
00:31:48,435 --> 00:31:50,824
I'm shaking.

417
00:31:51,487 --> 00:31:53,252
Then lean onto me.

418
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:57,213
It'll be fine as long as you follow me.

419
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:11,962
Jae Sung,
you make so happy I could cry.

420
00:32:15,181 --> 00:32:17,050
You make my hard past...

421
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:20,312
become like white snow.

422
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:26,499
I will be able to hold your hand
until the end, right?

423
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:28,557
Why are you worrying about that?

424
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:32,950
Once you've loved once,
you will always love, isn't it like that?

425
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,510
The bride that's getting married
tomorrow, how can she cry?

426
00:32:48,086 --> 00:32:50,480
If I've met you from the beginning,

427
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:55,417
would my life be different?

428
00:32:59,051 --> 00:33:04,051
Maybe I wouldn't have gotten
married with Hyun Woo.

429
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,640
If that person hadn't died...

430
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:16,998
we wouldn't have met.

431
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:19,696
That person and me,

432
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:25,658
will not be happy even if we started again.

433
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:30,005
A marriage that is destined for failure.

434
00:33:31,216 --> 00:33:35,461
Everyday will be filled with
hatred and pain.

435
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:53,727
Jae Sung, it seems like the first
time I've said this...

436
00:33:56,445 --> 00:34:01,523
but I really love you.

437
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,352
To protect this love,

438
00:34:07,874 --> 00:34:10,478
I'm willing to pay any price.

439
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:21,525
<i>You woman,</i>

440
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,789
<i>I can't believe even a crocodile's
tears can flow so freely.</i>

441
00:34:27,537 --> 00:34:29,912
<i>Your beautiful tears...</i>

442
00:34:30,457 --> 00:34:33,165
<i>I don't know what kind of thunder storm
they will become tomorrow.</i>

443
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,414
<i>I'm curious.</i>

444
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:49,198
Why is everyone sitting like
they're being punished?

445
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:52,377
The people collecting debts won't
chase you here, will they?

446
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:55,186
What happened? I will...

447
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:57,167
Don't be too depressed.

448
00:34:57,287 --> 00:35:00,553
There are times in life that you'll fall down
and experience storms.

449
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:03,028
How can it be possible that your whole life is
filled with sunny paths with fresh flowers?

450
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:08,514
Cheer up! If you're healthy, then you will
have a day when you will smile.

451
00:35:08,936 --> 00:35:12,063
Sorry. I've never thought that

452
00:35:12,183 --> 00:35:13,303
I would bring you trouble.

453
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:15,425
What trouble?

454
00:35:15,545 --> 00:35:17,948
The house is too small.
I'm the one who's sorry.

455
00:35:18,605 --> 00:35:21,528
Do we all have to sleep here?

456
00:35:21,648 --> 00:35:24,482
Because you're all guests,
I'll give you this side.

457
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:26,948
That side doesn't have heat, and is colder.

458
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,981
But since there are so many people,
it probably won't be too cold.

459
00:36:05,185 --> 00:36:08,644
<i>Right. I should just leave without
saying anything.</i>

460
00:36:09,354 --> 00:36:11,518
<i>While they're still missing
for each other and...</i>

461
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:14,224
<i>when it comes time that they
heal their wounds,</i>

462
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:16,656
<i>they should meet.
That should be fine, right?</i>

463
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:28,320
Sister... will she recognize
what I look like?

464
00:36:31,173 --> 00:36:35,195
Sister... why didn't she look for me?

465
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:38,253
She didn't want to throw me away, did she?

466
00:36:43,672 --> 00:36:49,576
Sister,
I miss you so much.

467
00:36:52,398 --> 00:37:01,412
I just want to call you again.
Sister. Sister.

468
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,774
It's finally today.

469
00:37:28,177 --> 00:37:29,839
Have you prepared everything?

470
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,539
Yes. The people in the family
have all moved out.

471
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,107
There's no need to wait.

472
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:38,402
There's something I need your help with.

473
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:41,603
Can you call the reporters over?

474
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:44,308
To the wedding church?

475
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,615
Okay. I'll try and think of something.

476
00:37:49,068 --> 00:37:50,508
Thanks.

477
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:57,460
But, when are you leaving?

478
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,958
After your wedding officially ends.

479
00:38:03,174 --> 00:38:07,105
I've only accepted help from you. To let you go like this,
my heart doesn't feel comfortable.

480
00:38:08,435 --> 00:38:12,478
After, I'll become like a brother to you in
place of Sang Mo, is that okay?

481
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,562
It's okay.

482
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,810
During this time,
because of leaving Sang Mo alone,

483
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,059
once I remember that I have
a brother near the sea,

484
00:38:25,444 --> 00:38:27,482
my heart feels uneasy.

485
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:29,307
I only want to

486
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:34,318
place him in my heart and leave.

487
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,102
Today, let's go to my father's grave,

488
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:42,225
and also to your parents'.

489
00:38:43,681 --> 00:38:46,009
If we're leaving tomorrow,
today's the only day we have time.

490
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:48,211
There's no time today.

491
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:54,511
To be truthful, I've set up an appointment
to see Kyung Ran.

492
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:02,599
Kyung Ran?
You know who Kyung Ran is?

493
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:07,288
Mother already set it up.
I've got to go there in a little while.

494
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:14,029
Kyung Ran may be different than
what you'd think she'd be.

495
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:16,142
After such a long while...

496
00:39:16,262 --> 00:39:18,554
you both might be disappointed.

497
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,213
Do you have to meet?

498
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:24,203
No matter what she changed into,
and how she lives,

499
00:39:24,776 --> 00:39:26,660
none of that matters.

500
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,833
My sister can meet me while still living,

501
00:39:29,311 --> 00:39:31,366
what else can I ask for?

502
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,558
I still need some things...

503
00:39:34,678 --> 00:39:36,269
so I'll hang onto my suitcase.

504
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,958
I'll leave directly from the hotel.

505
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,530
Let's meet tomorrow at the airport.

506
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,281
<i>Miss Yoon? Where are you right now?</i>

507
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:25,676
I'll go there right now. Wait a while.

508
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:42,109
Ahn Jae Sung, right now...

509
00:40:42,804 --> 00:40:44,954
it's time to say goodbye to you.

510
00:40:52,141 --> 00:40:53,521
Today at 11...

511
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:55,953
Kyung Ran will be at the Seoul Coffee Shop.

512
00:40:56,708 --> 00:41:00,032
Before I get there, you must make her
stay there no matter what.

513
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:03,083
Okay. I'm hanging up.

514
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:09,312
How are you feeling?

515
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:16,747
I'm shaking so much.
You're so handsome today.

516
00:41:17,162 --> 00:41:21,106
The bride is too pretty that she doesn't
even care about the groom anymore.

517
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,655
Really beautiful. Even God will be jealous.

518
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,608
Thanks.

519
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:33,006
But, where are your parents?

520
00:41:33,494 --> 00:41:36,856
They said they've just arrived at the airport,
and should be getting here soon.

521
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:40,232
What if they're disappointed
when they see me?

522
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:42,988
We don't have anyone to invite,

523
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:44,796
so the church must be empty.

524
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:47,453
Because I was afraid of that,
I spent some money and got some guests.

525
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:49,103
What?

526
00:41:49,366 --> 00:41:52,042
I heard it from someone that if
you give money...

527
00:41:52,372 --> 00:41:54,607
there will be fake guests who
come to the wedding.

528
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,984
So there can be fake relatives,
fake friends.

529
00:41:59,357 --> 00:42:01,700
Because I wanted to make you comfortable,
I also called some.

530
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,324
There's someone playing the
bridesmaid outside. Want to see?

531
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,279
Hello.

532
00:42:11,952 --> 00:42:13,849
<i>Here's the money I promised.</i>

533
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,950
<i>Until it ends, don't mess up
and do it properly.</i>

534
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:20,584
The bride is really pretty.

535
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:24,481
Be close.

536
00:42:24,856 --> 00:42:28,638
This way, later on, you can act
naturally at the church.

537
00:42:37,297 --> 00:42:41,043
So we've met again.
You look like you have abilities.

538
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,263
What happened? Why are you here?

539
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:48,483
Last time you came to my wedding,

540
00:42:48,803 --> 00:42:50,762
will the guests also come?

541
00:42:50,972 --> 00:42:53,214
It's a team. Of course we all come together.

542
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:59,626
You didn't say anything, did you?

543
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:01,527
If you say anything, I won't let you live.

544
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03,443
We've been doing this for a long time.

545
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:06,907
This is the basic, so don't worry.

546
00:43:09,321 --> 00:43:11,198
Why did it turn out like this?

547
00:43:14,652 --> 00:43:16,652
Why did you buy some clothes?

548
00:43:16,772 --> 00:43:18,339
It's okay if I just wore mine.

549
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:20,416
It's not that expensive...

550
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,695
I just called someone to deliver it this morning.
Don't blame me, okay?

551
00:43:24,295 --> 00:43:26,855
No matter who it is, sister or uncle,

552
00:43:26,975 --> 00:43:29,387
if you want them to like you,
you must be nice.

553
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,347
Even after I meet them...

554
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,979
you will be like a mom to me.

555
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,320
Do you know my meaning?

556
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,700
Why are you saying stuff like that?

557
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,921
After, you don't need to bother me.
I'm happy!

558
00:43:41,216 --> 00:43:42,944
When you came...

559
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:45,557
you just brought a pair of shoes with you.

560
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:47,573
Now, you've found your sister,

561
00:43:47,928 --> 00:43:50,010
and it's because of your kindness.

562
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:53,393
This is all because of you.

563
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:54,730
I will do good.

564
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:58,353
I will hear that even if my parents
weren't alive, I grew up well.

565
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:00,119
Don't worry.

566
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:08,057
Oh, our Rosemary,

567
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:09,848
you're marrying a person again?

568
00:44:10,486 --> 00:44:12,012
What are you doing here again?

569
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:14,697
We have nothing to meet over.

570
00:44:14,817 --> 00:44:17,608
No, you sent us an invitation,

571
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:20,010
so why are you saying something else now?

572
00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:23,479
President Hwang was busy,
so we came in place of him.

573
00:44:24,397 --> 00:44:27,777
Before, you didn't let him know,
and got in trouble.

574
00:44:28,306 --> 00:44:31,245
This time, make sure you tell him,
okay? Isn't it like this?

575
00:44:32,456 --> 00:44:36,850
Invitation? Who sent the invitation?

576
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:57,978
Mother. I am Hyun Woo.

577
00:44:58,944 --> 00:44:59,798
Hyun Woo?

578
00:44:59,918 --> 00:45:01,853
Hyun Woo? Where is he?

579
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:03,573
Where are you right now?

580
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,254
Tell me where you are right now!

581
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,197
I'm going crazy because I'm so anxious.

582
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:09,499
what? Hotel?

583
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:13,278
Yes. Bring father, Hyun Min, Hyun Jib,

584
00:45:13,398 --> 00:45:16,469
all of them. I'll be waiting.

585
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:18,892
I got it. I'll be there.

586
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:21,196
Before I get there, don't go anywhere!

587
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:25,066
Honey, our Hyun Woo said he's at a hotel,

588
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:26,910
and told us to go there quickly.

589
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,437
That kid finally came back.

590
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:32,688
He definitely will not pretend that he doesn't
know when his dad is in trouble.

591
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:35,146
What are you doing? Hyun Woo told you to go!

592
00:45:35,385 --> 00:45:38,003
Okay, I got it. Get dressed then come out.
I'll get the car ready.

593
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,221
He probably knew that you've
been forced out,

594
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:41,799
and booked a room at the hotel.

595
00:45:41,919 --> 00:45:45,836
Why did he make us worry during this
time if he was going to come?

596
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,223
When I see him, I'll definitely use my
energy and beat him up.

597
00:45:52,556 --> 00:45:53,797
Let's go.

598
00:46:03,907 --> 00:46:06,076
Who were those people?

599
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,173
People my father-in-law sent.

600
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,938
I don't know what happened,
but I think they were here to intimidate me.

601
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:17,267
Really? We're leaving anyways,
so don't think too much of it.

602
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:20,269
But, you're not looking too good.

603
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:23,459
It's almost time for the official party.

604
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,843
Come. Can we go?

605
00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:47,171
Miss Yoon...

606
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:50,828
Please talk with me for a while.

607
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:55,176
I have something urgent going on,
so I must leave.

608
00:46:57,073 --> 00:47:00,443
Don't go. You can't go!

609
00:47:01,657 --> 00:47:03,147
What are you talking about?

610
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:05,893
I'm saying this because I think of you.

611
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,114
Please believe in my words and stay here.

612
00:47:09,234 --> 00:47:12,718
Only then will the wheels of the mistake
car be stopped. Only you...

613
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,827
Why exactly are you being like that to me?

614
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:18,257
This is my personal business;
I don't need your intervention.

615
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,408
I know your sister.

616
00:47:20,528 --> 00:47:22,598
She has important stuff to tend to today,

617
00:47:23,002 --> 00:47:25,924
but because she wants to see you,

618
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,669
she might ruin it all.

619
00:47:28,242 --> 00:47:29,748
If you're really thinking of your sister,

620
00:47:30,544 --> 00:47:32,248
please stop yourself from
going this one day.

621
00:47:32,647 --> 00:47:34,279
You know my sister?

622
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:39,906
Sorry, but I don't believe in your words.

623
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,701
We've already set up a meeting...

624
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:43,920
and there's really no reason
to push it back.

625
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,059
Then. I'm going now.

626
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:47,777
You leave me with no choice.

627
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:50,853
I'll call your sister...

628
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:52,772
you say it yourself.

629
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:55,233
If you have courage to go after that,

630
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:57,500
then do as you wish.

631
00:48:02,803 --> 00:48:04,671
Give my sister a call?

632
00:48:04,963 --> 00:48:06,691
It's Joo Ah Ran?

633
00:48:07,461 --> 00:48:11,442
What is the reason why the two of you
won't let me see my sister?

634
00:48:11,658 --> 00:48:12,843
Hello?

635
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:14,655
Isn't this Ah Ran's cell phone?

636
00:48:14,775 --> 00:48:17,005
The bride probably left her cell phone here.

637
00:48:17,125 --> 00:48:20,279
She's at the church right now,
and can't talk.

638
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,856
Wedding church?

639
00:48:23,128 --> 00:48:24,639
Who's the bride?

640
00:48:24,759 --> 00:48:26,020
Joo Ah Ran.

641
00:48:26,978 --> 00:48:28,903
She's getting married?

642
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,731
Where is it happening now?

643
00:48:32,962 --> 00:48:34,962
Where is the church?!

644
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,294
This is impossible.

645
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,560
She's getting remarried to Shin Hyun Woo.

646
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,267
Doing such foolish things.

647
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,164
No, you can't go.

648
00:48:52,284 --> 00:48:53,973
Two people's hatred...

649
00:48:54,093 --> 00:48:55,852
let the two of them solve it.

650
00:48:56,481 --> 00:48:59,686
Miss Yoon. You knew of it too?

651
00:49:01,182 --> 00:49:03,044
You allowed it even though you knew?

652
00:49:04,171 --> 00:49:08,058
Joo Ah Ran and Shin Hyun Woo getting remarried.
Isn't that ridiculous?

653
00:49:32,554 --> 00:49:34,400
What are you doing right now?

654
00:49:58,551 --> 00:50:00,619
No. You can't go!

655
00:50:58,101 --> 00:50:59,519
<i>Yes. Let's begin.</i>

656
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:05,869
<i>Holding Groom Ahn Jae Sung,
and bride Joo Ahn Ran's wedding.</i>

657
00:51:05,989 --> 00:51:09,204
<i>The groom and bride are entering together.</i>

658
00:51:09,513 --> 00:51:12,612
<i>Groom. Bride. Enter!</i>

659
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,094
Isn't this song nice?

660
00:51:47,545 --> 00:51:51,094
Whenever I hear this song,
I feel so happy and blessed.

661
00:51:52,705 --> 00:51:56,799
Who chose this song?

662
00:51:58,047 --> 00:51:59,736
Of course I chose it.

663
00:52:00,207 --> 00:52:02,835
Why? You don't like it?

664
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,103
No, I like it.

665
00:52:27,058 --> 00:52:28,796
Why are you shaking like that?

666
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:32,453
Don't be nervous. I'm here.

667
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,460
I'm okay.

668
00:52:49,965 --> 00:52:52,540
Where did he tell us to go in the hotel?

669
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,209
Hyun Woo didn't say anything?

670
00:52:54,329 --> 00:52:58,077
Yes. He said that he'll see us
at the Seoul Hotel.

671
00:52:58,988 --> 00:53:00,904
12th floor. Wedding Ceremony.

672
00:53:01,289 --> 00:53:06,081
Look at this. Groom Ahn Jae Sung,
bride Joo Ah Ran.

673
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:10,259
Joo Ah Ran? No way.

674
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,686
What? It's not Nam Joo Seung either.

675
00:53:13,806 --> 00:53:16,473
Ahn Jae Sun and Joo Ah Ran
are getting married?

676
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,994
These guys. Where is the elevator?

677
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:26,169
<i>Right now, the bow that will bound them
together for 100 years.</i>

678
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:29,707
<i>Groom, Bride. Bow.</i>

679
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:37,813
These ridiculous...

680
00:53:38,086 --> 00:53:39,623
It really is Joo Ah Ran!

681
00:53:40,622 --> 00:53:42,161
How could something like this happen?

682
00:53:42,281 --> 00:53:44,968
<i>She's still in the process of getting divorced,
now she's secretly getting married?</i>

683
00:53:48,797 --> 00:53:51,323
Just now my parents and brothers
have arrived.

684
00:53:51,886 --> 00:53:54,949
After the wedding ends,
I'll introduce them to you.

685
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:04,465
Next, we'll see a presentation of the groom
and bride's happy life journey.

686
00:54:05,545 --> 00:54:07,017
Presentation?

687
00:54:57,226 --> 00:54:58,043
<i>I love you.</i>

688
00:54:58,163 --> 00:54:59,217
<i>I love you Joo Seung.</i>

689
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,496
<i>I love you.</i>

690
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:20,967
Those are all lies.

691
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:26,153
Quickly, turn it off! Turn it off!

692
00:55:29,177 --> 00:55:32,633
Was that... Ah Ran's real self?

693
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,417
Someone who proposed love
to 3 different men...

694
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:38,858
how can I trust you?

695
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:44,485
No. It must be someone's prank.

696
00:55:50,842 --> 00:55:54,071
Where is Shin Hyun Woo? Come out.

697
00:55:54,191 --> 00:55:56,223
Hurry up and come out!

698
00:55:56,796 --> 00:55:59,397
If you have something to say,
appear before me!

699
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:02,540
Don't hide like a coward. Come out!

700
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,510
<i>Joo Ah Ran.</i>

701
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,857
Do you still remember me?

702
00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:11,450
I'm the security guard that used to
work at the Yang Pyeong villa.

703
00:56:11,957 --> 00:56:14,041
What are you talking about?

704
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:16,516
I don't know you.

705
00:56:16,636 --> 00:56:19,840
The money you gave me,
I have the record right here.

706
00:56:20,141 --> 00:56:21,618
You say you don't know me?

707
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:24,357
You locked up Shin Hyun Woo and the nurse

708
00:56:24,477 --> 00:56:26,259
and told me to watch them.

709
00:56:26,379 --> 00:56:30,858
I am the physician Joo Ah Ran found.

710
00:56:30,978 --> 00:56:35,944
She told me that she'll give me a huge amount
of money if I pretended to be a doctor.

711
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:39,587
So I pretended to be Shin Hyun Woo's doctor.

712
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:42,395
I have also seen you.

713
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,882
From our villa, we could see your villa.

714
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,290
You always had a security guard guarding the villa,
which was weird.

715
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,900
Who are you?

716
00:56:54,055 --> 00:56:55,571
Don't intervene in other people's business.

717
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,115
Shut up. Go away!

718
00:56:57,235 --> 00:56:58,636
Also, there's another important truth.

719
00:56:59,012 --> 00:57:03,988
One day, when I was getting some
air on my balcony...

720
00:57:04,439 --> 00:57:07,210
I saw you running out of the burning villa.

721
00:57:07,755 --> 00:57:08,872
The clothes you wore at that time,

722
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,299
I remember them very clearly.

723
00:57:10,806 --> 00:57:12,515
<i>But, after the incident, I heard that</i>

724
00:57:13,126 --> 00:57:16,581
in that villa, there was a patient
who was unable to move.

725
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:20,461
Lies! It wasn't me.

726
00:57:21,643 --> 00:57:23,722
Someone told you to do this, didn't they?

727
00:57:23,842 --> 00:57:25,778
They gave you money, didn't they?

728
00:57:26,754 --> 00:57:28,227
<i>I saw it too.</i>

729
00:57:29,473 --> 00:57:32,899
This woman was driving really fast,
and almost hit my child.

730
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:36,328
Not long after that,
I heard the ambulance's sound.

731
00:57:37,276 --> 00:57:41,524
On one night,
I saw her push a person in a wheelchair.

732
00:57:41,644 --> 00:57:45,142
<i>It was too scary.
I had nightmares for a lot of nights.</i>

733
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,397
Joo Ah Ran.

734
00:58:33,313 --> 00:58:35,428
Why aren't you saying anything?

735
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,407
At least try to defend yourself a little.

736
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:46,177
The real Ah Ran that's hiding underneath
that pretty face...

737
00:58:46,994 --> 00:58:48,865
how many are there?

738
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:54,616
Shin Hyun Woo, did you really kill him?

739
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,499
No. No!

740
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:03,063
I didn't kill! I'm innocent.

741
00:59:03,851 --> 00:59:05,475
I didn't know of this.

742
00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:16,795
Enough! Everyone stop!

743
00:59:26,513 --> 00:59:30,927
Nam Joo Seung. What are you doing right now?

744
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:35,668
Other people's sacred weddings,
is this something that you can intervene in?

745
00:59:36,358 --> 00:59:38,123
Hurry up and go back!

746
00:59:38,243 --> 00:59:39,755
Must you be like this?

747
00:59:40,912 --> 00:59:42,912
A woman you have once loved...

748
00:59:43,551 --> 00:59:46,161
must you step all over her to get happiness?

749
00:59:47,029 --> 00:59:49,404
You were treated that because of a reason!

750
00:59:50,766 --> 00:59:52,888
The victim also have responsibility.

751
00:59:54,503 --> 00:59:56,566
Don't say anything. Come with me.

752
00:59:58,933 --> 01:00:03,426
Wait a minute, you have yet to account for the crime
you've committed against my brother.

753
01:00:04,445 --> 01:00:05,910
Joo Ah Ran..

754
01:00:06,839 --> 01:00:09,913
My innocent and kind younger brother,
why did you kill him?

755
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:12,805
After you stole his design...

756
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:15,021
and satisfied your wish, that is enough.

757
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,931
Why did my poor brother have to die?

758
01:00:18,051 --> 01:00:20,307
Didn't I already settle my debt with you?

759
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:22,504
Why are you here again?

760
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:24,894
The person is dead. What debts are finished?

761
01:00:25,799 --> 01:00:27,659
Using your snake tongue...

762
01:00:27,779 --> 01:00:30,721
did you think saying sorry would
grant you forgiveness?

763
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:35,268
Crime, will eventually come back like a boomerang,
didn't you know?

764
01:00:35,388 --> 01:00:37,259
Suicide was that person's choice.

765
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:40,528
He was depressed about his life...

766
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,969
strictly speaking, that's not
my responsibility.

767
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,286
Do you have evidence that I killed him?

768
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:48,469
The mentally unstable brother,

769
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:50,332
by neglecting him,

770
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:52,467
isn't that your responsibility?

771
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:57,943
My brother was afraid of that,
so he recorded your voice.

772
01:00:59,106 --> 01:01:00,815
My brother's present

773
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,190
to the woman he loved.

774
01:01:04,647 --> 01:01:06,995
<i>Without you, SOUL is still doing
really well.</i>

775
01:01:07,115 --> 01:01:09,910
<i>There are a lot of top designers on
the on the streets,</i>

776
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:12,731
<i>don't stay around and get lost!</i>

777
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:14,534
<i>Annoying! So annoying!</i>

778
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,740
<i>Why are you sticking to me like a parasite?</i>

779
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:19,970
<i>I don't love you. I love your designs.</i>

780
01:01:22,164 --> 01:01:23,647
So it's like this.

781
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:27,648
You killed Jung Sang Mo like this too?

782
01:01:29,263 --> 01:01:31,873
How many secrets are out there
that I don't know?

783
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:38,224
Just now, the black box from Shin Hyun Woo's
accident had been found.

784
01:01:38,878 --> 01:01:40,896
It was very damaged...

785
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:43,353
but I'm curious to see how
well it was restored.

786
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:45,303
Black Box.

787
01:01:49,277 --> 01:01:51,127
<i>If you have found the couple ring,</i>

788
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:53,565
<i>then you should know who
it is I love, right?</i>

789
01:01:53,685 --> 01:01:55,350
<i>Nam Joo Seung is my brother!</i>

790
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:56,645
<i>And also my parents' directing doctor.</i>

791
01:01:56,765 --> 01:01:57,830
<i>He is also my man!</i>

792
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,236
<i>No! No!</i>

793
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:21,552
Why isn't she here yet?

794
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:23,627
She said she'd be here at 12!

795
01:02:23,747 --> 01:02:26,428
Right. It's driving people crazy.

796
01:02:27,095 --> 01:02:30,053
<i>The person you're looking for doesn't
seem to be here yet.</i>

797
01:02:30,173 --> 01:02:33,320
Right. Circle round a few more times.

798
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,660
We must find our daughter. Go.

799
01:02:39,185 --> 01:02:41,122
The coffee shop IS here, isn't it?

800
01:02:41,242 --> 01:02:44,218
Do you want to go outside and
look for her? Hurry.

801
01:02:50,904 --> 01:02:53,938
Sorry, but where is the wedding ceremony?

802
01:02:54,058 --> 01:02:56,531
A hotel is for eating, and sleeping.
Why would there be weddings?

803
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:58,850
We're very busy, ask elsewhere.

804
01:03:04,437 --> 01:03:09,108
Joo Ah Ran. How could you do those
things to Hyun Woo.

805
01:03:09,334 --> 01:03:11,170
Are you still trying to live like this?

806
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:13,452
You're not satisfied with just
killing your husband,

807
01:03:13,572 --> 01:03:15,856
but also forcing your in-laws
out on the streets,

808
01:03:16,245 --> 01:03:18,590
<i>and marrying some other guy.</i>

809
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,924
Are you not afraid of the heavens?

810
01:03:21,044 --> 01:03:22,938
<i>You cruel and vicious person!</i>

811
01:03:27,974 --> 01:03:29,356
So it's like this.

812
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:35,054
This was all devised by you, wasn't it?

813
01:03:36,518 --> 01:03:39,264
After I stole your fortune,
you feel wronged,

814
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:41,423
so you hired people to act as witnesses,

815
01:03:41,543 --> 01:03:43,968
<i>and made a ridiculous video.</i>

816
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:45,902
Compared to your son,

817
01:03:46,193 --> 01:03:48,075
is losing your fortune that much worse?

818
01:03:48,944 --> 01:03:52,521
You wanted to ruin my wedding,
and did all this, right?

819
01:03:52,803 --> 01:03:54,452
Just like you said...

820
01:03:54,737 --> 01:03:57,982
crime will not rot away,
and will grow bigger.

821
01:03:58,724 --> 01:04:01,963
<i>So now the truth has been revealed.</i>

822
01:04:02,357 --> 01:04:07,118
Yet you still don't admit it, do you?

823
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:12,075
I'll be the last witness.

824
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:18,967
Nurse Yoon! Don't say anything!

825
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:21,063
Don't do something that you'll regret.

826
01:04:21,183 --> 01:04:24,603
No, it's because I was too clear,
during this period of time,

827
01:04:24,723 --> 01:04:28,247
about Shin Hyun Woo and his family's
many sufferings.

828
01:04:28,367 --> 01:04:30,934
So I must say them. I must!

829
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:35,395
I am a nurse that tended to Shin Hyun Woo

830
01:04:35,515 --> 01:04:38,014
at the Yang Pyeong villa.

831
01:04:38,259 --> 01:04:40,862
The Joo Ah Ran and Director Nam here,

832
01:04:40,982 --> 01:04:43,761
they prevented me from giving treatment.

833
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:46,503
They gave up on the patient completely,
and left him to die.

834
01:04:46,623 --> 01:04:48,200
Shut that mouth!

835
01:04:49,076 --> 01:04:51,074
You don't know anything yet
you appeared here?

836
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:52,265
Get out right now.

837
01:04:52,385 --> 01:04:53,574
Not only that...

838
01:04:53,694 --> 01:04:56,857
she poured hot water on the patient,
causing life-threatening damage.

839
01:04:57,092 --> 01:04:59,270
She also tortured him mentally.

840
01:04:59,674 --> 01:05:03,382
Shin Hyun Woo,
after regaining consciousness,

841
01:05:03,739 --> 01:05:05,651
feared his wife's revenge.

842
01:05:06,086 --> 01:05:08,659
He hid the fact that he was still awake.

843
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:12,454
Joo Ah Ran, before causing the fire,

844
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:15,430
was a murderer that killed
her husband's soul.

845
01:05:19,214 --> 01:05:23,375
Jae Sung, we've gotten into a trap.

846
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:25,695
They're all framing me.

847
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,606
Truthfully, Shin Hyun Woo died
because of a gas explosion.

848
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:32,509
I wasn't at the scene at all.

849
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,808
The accident had nothing to
do with me at all.

850
01:05:35,152 --> 01:05:38,509
What if I don't believe you?

851
01:05:38,629 --> 01:05:40,181
You have to believe me!

852
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:44,326
Plug your ears, close your eyes,
only listen to me.

853
01:05:47,512 --> 01:05:49,552
A wedding ceremony is not needed,

854
01:05:49,672 --> 01:05:50,730
let's just leave.

855
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:52,885
<i>Just like we planned,</i>

856
01:05:53,005 --> 01:05:55,448
let's go to a new country
and begin a new life.

857
01:05:55,971 --> 01:05:59,962
I love you. Didn't you say you love me too?

858
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:01,853
So, the past doesn't matter.

859
01:06:02,272 --> 01:06:03,370
Let's leave!

860
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:05,116
Let's leave right now!

861
01:06:05,236 --> 01:06:07,107
You took away someone's life,

862
01:06:07,854 --> 01:06:10,213
and then you that ruined
everything in their life.

863
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:13,853
But for your own happiness,
you're still standing here?

864
01:06:14,544 --> 01:06:19,262
You're shameful and ridiculous.
I'll make sure...

865
01:06:20,025 --> 01:06:24,219
that all of your crimes come crawling out
of your mouth like bugs.

866
01:06:25,311 --> 01:06:27,435
Until the day you die...

867
01:06:27,822 --> 01:06:30,005
you'll pay for all of your crimes.

868
01:06:36,956 --> 01:06:38,797
What? Who are you?

869
01:06:39,961 --> 01:06:41,524
You still don't know?

870
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:46,029
The Romeo whose heart was stolen.

871
01:06:47,026 --> 01:06:51,809
The one you killed..
your husband Shin Hyun Woo.

880
01:08:06,892 --> 01:08:07,664
PREVIEW:

881
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:10,105
The Ahn Jae Sung that said he loved me.

882
01:08:10,225 --> 01:08:12,241
Look closely at reality!

883
01:08:12,361 --> 01:08:14,016
It is more painful than death.

884
01:08:14,136 --> 01:08:15,891
I will let you have a true taste of what it
feels like to be worse than death.

885
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:17,126
Are you really my son Hyun Woo?

886
01:08:17,246 --> 01:08:18,007
Yes.

887
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,403
No mistake,
it's our son Hyun Woo!

888
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:20,635
Are you really going to turn yourself in?

889
01:08:20,755 --> 01:08:21,741
Leave it to me.

890
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:22,983
I want to get married to Jae Hee.

891
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:25,105
Marriage? As long as it's not with
Joo Chul Min's children.

892
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,290
This wedding cannot be. I don't approve.

893
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,913
Jae Hee is not the same as Ah Ran!

894
01:08:29,006 --> 01:08:30,490
Actually, they're the same!

895
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,544
<i>That man. I definitely cannot give
him to Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

896
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,128
Who are you?

897
01:08:35,248 --> 01:08:36,384
<i>Are you going to do it to the end?</i>

898
01:08:36,504 --> 01:08:37,724
<i>Do you still not understand?</i>

899
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:40,239
<i>Your Dad, killed my parents in front of me.</i>

900
01:08:40,359 --> 01:08:43,455
<i>Let's see whose crime was bigger.
You should be able to tell without calculating, right?</i>

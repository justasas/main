1
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:19,829
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

2
00:00:19,872 --> 00:00:22,238
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

3
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:26,373
I'll be right behind the wall

4
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:39,018
In 370BC, the Warring States China

5
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:41,117
Zhao Nation dispatched 100,000 warriors

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,061
led by Xiang Yanzhong,
to attack Yan Nation

7
00:00:44,097 --> 00:00:46,327
LIANG stands right on his path to Yan

8
00:00:46,366 --> 00:00:49,233
There's no way she can
resist Zhao's mighty troop

9
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,634
and will be definitely taken as buffer

10
00:00:52,472 --> 00:00:54,804
Their only chance for survival is to

11
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:56,240
ask for the help of Mozi warrior

12
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:59,005
who are experts in defending

13
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,976
but...

14
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:05,143
as Liang teeters on the edge of peril

15
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:07,049
Mozi warriors...

16
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,986
still didn't arrive

17
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:22,798
Father, we must fight

18
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:28,403
Zhao's Commander
Xiang Yanzhong is a brilliant strategist

19
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,810
His advance troop has already arrived

20
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,109
We have to take action now

21
00:01:35,648 --> 00:01:38,481
before the arrival of their main force

22
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:40,918
we must surrender

23
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:44,946
otherwise, we're all done for

24
00:01:48,694 --> 00:01:51,788
Fighting with bare hands...

25
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:54,090
ends up the same...

26
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:56,028
My Lord

27
00:01:58,438 --> 00:01:59,769
My Lord

28
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:04,106
what if the Mozi army
were to make it here?

29
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:10,546
Assemble at the Gate, quick

30
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,517
Get the horses ready

31
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:13,985
Move on, quick

32
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:18,554
Hurry up

33
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:25,228
Come on, hurry up

34
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:30,934
Cavalry Chief

35
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,733
Who told you to ride out?

36
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,000
Your Majesty's decree

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,099
All cavaliers await at the South Gate

38
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:37,734
for General Niu's order

39
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:41,971
General, the surrender notes
and cavaliers are ready

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,175
Open the Gate

41
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:15,578
Open the Gate

42
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:49,414
Someone's approaching from the West

43
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:08,764
Who are you?

44
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:15,469
Mozi, Ge Li

45
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:19,035
Mozi has finally arrived

46
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,015
Open the Gate

47
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,418
Open the Gate

48
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:39,558
Take this

49
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,024
Zhao soldiers... they're here

50
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,780
Zhao's hostile force

51
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:02,416
They're furious, shall we inform the King?

52
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,290
Who are you?

53
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,424
How dare you trespasses on our camp site

54
00:05:14,467 --> 00:05:17,732
This is General Niu of LIANG

55
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,441
I'm here to deliver the surrender note

56
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:33,250
Send cavaliers to pass them
our surrender decision

57
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:34,252
Yes

58
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,856
Attack

59
00:05:54,607 --> 00:05:58,441
You think surrendering and not fighting

60
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,308
can please the Zhao?

61
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:02,405
And stop the war?

62
00:06:02,448 --> 00:06:03,813
Zhao's army is huge

63
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:06,477
you want us all to get killed?

64
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,631
When they take over Liang,
you'll still have to suffer

65
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:26,564
Ministers will be killed

66
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:32,911
soldiers will be captured

67
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:37,272
your families will be ruined

68
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,152
women will be dishonored

69
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:44,816
Why?

70
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:47,587
Are you contented with this?

71
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:52,089
Why don't you give a try?

72
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:54,229
Though...

73
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:56,534
we may die in the battle

74
00:06:57,903 --> 00:06:59,962
but at least you'd tried

75
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,632
and if we can make it

76
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:04,404
we'll make it worth

77
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:05,774
We can't give up our homeland

78
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:07,108
What shall we do then?

79
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:08,238
Sir, please lead us to defend

80
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,875
Yes, lead us

81
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,815
Take action now, Mozi

82
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:18,756
Zhao army is already here

83
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,564
Can you give me your bow?

84
00:08:04,603 --> 00:08:06,264
Their distance is too far

85
00:08:06,305 --> 00:08:07,704
Give me

86
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:25,881
To fight or surrender?

87
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:31,594
No one is allowed to intrude into my city

88
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:56,952
Protect the General

89
00:09:06,465 --> 00:09:08,092
General Gao...

90
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:12,833
General Wei commanded us to retreat?

91
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:17,169
Retreat

92
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:18,437
Thank you

93
00:09:18,477 --> 00:09:21,469
Good job, they'd retreated

94
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:23,674
They are only the vanguard troop

95
00:09:23,716 --> 00:09:25,479
It's just the beginning

96
00:09:28,354 --> 00:09:30,652
Retreat

97
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,029
Your majesty

98
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,087
Proceed

99
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:44,161
A Mozi arrived and
drove away the Zhao's vanguard

100
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,363
Congratulations, My Lord

101
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:48,771
Liang is saved

102
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:00,946
Nonsense

103
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,654
My Lord, please take care

104
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,290
My Lord...

105
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:14,529
My Lord...

106
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:20,694
Your Honor, the King was drunk

107
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:28,075
Back off, the Prince is coming

108
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:30,081
Come on, good boy

109
00:10:40,793 --> 00:10:42,693
The King is not feeling well

110
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:45,590
your request had to be put back later

111
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:49,265
Enemies are right outside,
we don't have much time

112
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:50,893
By the way

113
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,097
which cities have you protected before?

114
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:58,341
This is my first time

115
00:10:59,178 --> 00:11:00,736
You are the only one they sent?

116
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:05,548
How about the jade pendant?

117
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:08,616
Did you bring it?

118
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:10,349
It's still in the Mozi Hall

119
00:11:12,224 --> 00:11:14,886
It was our token for Mozi's help

120
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,895
How can you forget?

121
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,061
Let me have a look

122
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:19,996
General Wei

123
00:11:20,032 --> 00:11:21,624
why...

124
00:11:22,968 --> 00:11:24,765
Just a little modification...

125
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,797
and double the shooting range

126
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,002
Why do you stop my attack?

127
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:34,945
What for?

128
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,210
We don't need to attack

129
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:40,717
Liang had already sent
someone here to surrender

130
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:45,718
Then, why are they shooting me?

131
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:49,419
Give out my order

132
00:11:50,229 --> 00:11:53,164
block off all the paths to Liang

133
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:56,759
poison all its water source.

134
00:11:56,802 --> 00:12:00,203
No one is to go near Liang
without my order

135
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:01,729
Yes

136
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:03,935
That just...

137
00:12:03,976 --> 00:12:06,069
gives them time to defend

138
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:12,208
Don't worry

139
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,118
we'll discuss
when the Commander arrives

140
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:18,650
Sir, Prince Liang Shi offered...

141
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:24,392
you to rest here for the night

142
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,522
Thank you

143
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:51,482
Thank you

144
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,502
Cavalry Chief

145
00:13:18,016 --> 00:13:21,008
Who did the arrangement?
He's here to protect us

146
00:13:21,053 --> 00:13:21,985
It's the Prince's order...

147
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,487
The Prince? How can he...

148
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,135
My Prince was convinced by an outsider

149
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,163
and stimulated the Zhao's vanguard

150
00:13:42,207 --> 00:13:44,835
They will definitely retaliate.

151
00:13:44,877 --> 00:13:46,845
I'm sure your majesty understands

152
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,213
What is your suggestion?

153
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:55,283
Your servant believes that...

154
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,847
Don't hesitate? Say it.

155
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,855
Ge Li persuaded the people

156
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:09,061
and offended the Zhao
against your decree

157
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,501
We must arrest Ge Li

158
00:14:11,537 --> 00:14:13,698
and hand him over to the Zhao

159
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:17,038
That will placate them

160
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:20,567
and show My Lord's sincerity

161
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:24,446
If Xiang Yanzhong and his troops arrive

162
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,509
Liang will be in great danger

163
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,714
Royal Tutor wants me to...

164
00:14:32,758 --> 00:14:35,090
turn against the Mozi?

165
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:36,924
My Lord

166
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,465
this is the only way to save Liang

167
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,267
What about the Mozi?

168
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,398
They would be furious

169
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:54,170
Ge Li didn't bring the pendant you sent

170
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,512
his identity is unclear

171
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:01,348
My Lord

172
00:15:01,386 --> 00:15:02,751
Proceed

173
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,586
The Prince came to see
your majesty with Mozi Ge Li

174
00:15:08,727 --> 00:15:12,595
Bring Ge Li to the Main Hall alone

175
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:13,859
Yes

176
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:27,006
Long live My Lord

177
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,686
Ge Li

178
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:43,752
Yes

179
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:47,629
I've heard that you've never lead troops

180
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,726
or protect a city before

181
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,033
Facing Xiang Yanzhong's force

182
00:15:55,073 --> 00:16:00,067
how will you save Liang?

183
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:03,275
Zhao's target is Yan Nation

184
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:07,581
they won't risk their mission on Liang

185
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:11,680
The battle with Liang
must be fast and clear

186
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:14,157
Survival or not

187
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:17,252
depends on how long Liang can hold

188
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,197
How long will it take to repel the Zhao?

189
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:26,296
If Liang can hold up to one month,
Zhao will retreat

190
00:16:29,041 --> 00:16:31,009
Ge Li

191
00:16:31,877 --> 00:16:34,402
You think...

192
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:36,380
how long can Liang hold?

193
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:40,317
That's up to your trust on me

194
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,843
I trust you unquestionably

195
00:16:42,888 --> 00:16:44,150
Then, I urged you to

196
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:47,022
hand over all command to Ge Li

197
00:16:48,894 --> 00:16:52,352
The utmost care must be taken

198
00:16:52,397 --> 00:16:54,592
orders must be clear & strict

199
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,863
efficiency is most important

200
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,302
Right

201
00:17:03,475 --> 00:17:07,138
Right

202
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:11,976
It seems that...

203
00:17:12,017 --> 00:17:16,249
Liang is going for a long siege

204
00:17:16,955 --> 00:17:18,320
Yes

205
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:21,520
But what if...

206
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,793
...I mean if you were killed?

207
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:29,494
What else can we do?

208
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:31,658
How about...

209
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:35,400
not fighting?

210
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,112
Not to fight?

211
00:17:42,147 --> 00:17:43,671
Right

212
00:17:46,418 --> 00:17:49,683
That's all on your will

213
00:17:50,288 --> 00:17:51,983
My will is strong for that

214
00:17:58,463 --> 00:18:01,227
Then tie up Ge Li now

215
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,769
let Prince Liang Shi...

216
00:18:06,071 --> 00:18:08,005
bring him to the Zhao

217
00:18:09,207 --> 00:18:12,370
That will stop the war

218
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:17,344
You can bring along your families

219
00:18:17,382 --> 00:18:19,942
go to Zhao Nation

220
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:22,647
and plead for forgiveness

221
00:18:23,522 --> 00:18:28,425
You then hand over Liang to the Zhao

222
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:35,199
All men will become slaves

223
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:36,165
Then...

224
00:18:36,201 --> 00:18:40,604
the people of Liang will suffer no war

225
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,399
If your majesty prefers this

226
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:49,278
Fine, Ge Li will do all he can

227
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,781
Please

228
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:41,395
The king sees his people as everything

229
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:45,934
My decision is... at all costs

230
00:19:46,705 --> 00:19:48,673
Liang Shi

231
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:51,873
Yes

232
00:19:53,078 --> 00:19:57,674
You must obey Ge Li's command

233
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:59,843
Apart from the Royal guards

234
00:19:59,885 --> 00:20:03,753
Mozi Ge Li will command all troops

235
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:06,689
to resist Zhao's invasion

236
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:11,389
Anyone who disobeys his orders will be...

237
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:13,021
be-headed

238
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:20,594
Our enemy will poison our water source

239
00:20:21,106 --> 00:20:22,664
from now on

240
00:20:22,707 --> 00:20:26,609
we must not use any water
flowing into Liang

241
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:30,979
We'll have to dig more wells in the city

242
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:35,180
Collect farmer's harvest

243
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,188
select several locations in the city

244
00:20:37,222 --> 00:20:38,883
as food storages

245
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,757
All food and water
will be under distribution

246
00:20:41,793 --> 00:20:43,852
Direct all water drainage

247
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,830
to the farmland and let it swamp

248
00:20:46,865 --> 00:20:48,992
Swamp the farmland?

249
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,298
We'll starve ourselves of food

250
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,861
With appropriate allocation

251
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:56,965
our coffers will last us for a year

252
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,942
Then what?

253
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:00,945
We'll have kept the city

254
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,871
but there'll be nothing left

255
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:08,284
If we lose our lives,
what good will come of that?

256
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,685
Even if we block off the East

257
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:12,417
enemies will attack us
from other directions

258
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,957
The west and north
give us natural barriers

259
00:21:16,995 --> 00:21:19,429
Enemies will not
attack from those directions

260
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,625
How about the south?

261
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,156
Why don't we spend more effort on it?

262
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:26,602
Every city must have one weakness

263
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:31,075
this is where our enemies will attack

264
00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:33,475
so as to control their attack

265
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:36,846
Gather all the strong men

266
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:41,944
we've to build a bulwark
at the south in seven days

267
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,952
Can that be done?

268
00:21:45,991 --> 00:21:46,980
Mr. Ge Li

269
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,391
how can we build a bulwark
in such a short time?

270
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:50,951
It would take at least a year

271
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:53,692
to bring the stones from the mountain

272
00:21:53,732 --> 00:21:56,701
Knocking down the palace wall?

273
00:21:57,736 --> 00:21:59,966
How can you protect the palace?

274
00:22:00,005 --> 00:22:01,529
Are you revolting?

275
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:10,210
These stones are for building a bulwark

276
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:12,610
The bulwark

277
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:16,619
is our first line of defense

278
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,457
If we lose the city

279
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:22,119
the palace will be lost too

280
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,994
Protecting the city means
protecting the palace

281
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:28,363
Ge Li

282
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,927
can a bulwark built in such a short tim

283
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:35,371
defend Xiang Yanzhong's troop?

284
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:38,672
To defend Liang in such a way...

285
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,837
This is not only defending

286
00:22:40,879 --> 00:22:45,680
it's also a psychological tactic

287
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:52,180
The bulwark has to be built precisely

288
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:54,487
matching with the main wall

289
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:56,926
The efficiency of the Liang people

290
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:00,590
will definitely threaten our enemies

291
00:23:06,171 --> 00:23:08,435
Your highness

292
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:11,306
please allow cavalry to
help with moving the stones

293
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,276
to speed up the process

294
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:16,608
Cavalry troops represent
the superiority of Liang

295
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:19,981
how can they be used to move stones?

296
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:24,749
I believe that...

297
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,882
this may prove My Lord's love

298
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:29,393
and care for his people

299
00:23:29,427 --> 00:23:31,224
Right

300
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:36,032
With their help, seven days will be enough

301
00:23:53,685 --> 00:23:55,949
Unload and move on quickly

302
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:58,079
The sun rises in this direction

303
00:23:58,123 --> 00:24:00,990
Sunlight will be the strongest after 3 hours

304
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:09,226
Move back

305
00:24:17,008 --> 00:24:19,533
There's drinking water outside the Gate

306
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:23,405
Go by the side

307
00:24:23,448 --> 00:24:25,848
Move on quickly

308
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,618
Record the landscape

309
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:30,814
Yes

310
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:34,189
Let's go the stream

311
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,522
Go

312
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:09,554
What a disgrace, never-ending warfare

313
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:11,494
There's war everywhere

314
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,794
I don't want to run anymore

315
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,960
You want to die here?

316
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:19,333
That Mozi looks quite capable

317
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,395
maybe Liang can hold

318
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:24,033
Why don't we just give them the city?

319
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:26,509
Who cares who we pay tax to?

320
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:27,670
Quiet...

321
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,011
Quick, unload these alcohols

322
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,516
Yes...

323
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,111
Cai Qiu...

324
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:16,426
Don't go

325
00:26:16,995 --> 00:26:19,725
Come back

326
00:26:51,062 --> 00:26:53,997
Just let the baby cry...

327
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:56,433
Be quiet

328
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:57,764
What is it?

329
00:26:57,802 --> 00:26:59,599
Zhao troops arrived

330
00:26:59,637 --> 00:27:01,400
Don't let the baby cry

331
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:02,428
Keep quiet

332
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:03,303
Don't let her cry

333
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,036
- Let me hug her
- Give her to me

334
00:27:05,076 --> 00:27:06,634
Don't hurt the child

335
00:27:06,678 --> 00:27:08,509
Stop the crying

336
00:27:08,546 --> 00:27:10,776
Let me hug her

337
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:14,146
Don't let the baby cry

338
00:27:14,185 --> 00:27:17,154
Give her to me

339
00:27:17,188 --> 00:27:20,055
Give her the child

340
00:27:20,091 --> 00:27:22,025
Stop her crying and keep quiet

341
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,049
sister...

342
00:27:23,094 --> 00:27:25,028
My child

343
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:26,621
My child

344
00:27:26,664 --> 00:27:27,858
Shut up

345
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:29,366
We are all going to die

346
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,924
Stop crying

347
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:42,106
You flee because you don't want to fight

348
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:45,245
we're also tired of killing

349
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:47,915
We're heading to Yan Nation

350
00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:50,785
and just bypassing Liang for supplies

351
00:27:50,822 --> 00:27:53,450
How come Liang confused our purpose?

352
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:56,650
Is there someone persuading you?

353
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:00,161
A Mozi came...

354
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,130
his name is Geli...

355
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,531
Only one?

356
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:09,163
4,000 people persuaded by one person

357
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:12,074
to fight against 100,000 soldiers?

358
00:28:13,344 --> 00:28:14,834
We dare not

359
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:21,382
Leaders must earn their respect

360
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:25,547
Zi Tuan, you'll lead the archers

361
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:28,554
Will you take the command?

362
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,887
Why don't you take Ge Li's order?

363
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:36,661
How dare you

364
00:28:36,701 --> 00:28:39,670
Your skill and experience is not up to mine

365
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,195
how can you be the leader?

366
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,299
You're not qualified and hiding the truth

367
00:28:45,009 --> 00:28:46,271
Guards

368
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:47,941
Take him

369
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:49,412
No

370
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,709
Stop

371
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:59,618
Not up to the Prince's skill
will had to be imprisoned

372
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:02,285
I should be taken too

373
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:08,622
Leaders must earn their respect

374
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,566
Zi Tuan is not qualified

375
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,125
Zi Tuan's archery

376
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,331
had amazed me on the day I arrive Liang

377
00:29:14,372 --> 00:29:18,331
Warfare is a matter of
strategies and cooperation

378
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:21,777
no single man can ever hold off an army

379
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,303
Right

380
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:28,147
For military tactics

381
00:29:28,186 --> 00:29:33,522
we can only judge
when the enemy is at our doorstep

382
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:38,894
But for archery, let's settle it right now

383
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:48,938
the top of that pole is the target

384
00:29:48,973 --> 00:29:51,237
you each have five shots

385
00:29:51,275 --> 00:29:53,436
You start first

386
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:07,018
Quit now and I can spare your life

387
00:30:09,127 --> 00:30:10,560
Please start

388
00:30:49,567 --> 00:30:52,627
Even if you made it, you'll never beat me

389
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,830
You lose

390
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,930
Guards, take him

391
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,109
Wait

392
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:33,606
You're the best archer

393
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,976
best rider, and best fighter

394
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:39,607
all because you're the Prince of Liang

395
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:42,414
You should widen your scope

396
00:31:43,154 --> 00:31:46,419
the world is bigger than you think

397
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:52,796
What's going on?

398
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,661
They're beating up
those who tried to escape

399
00:31:57,768 --> 00:32:00,032
I dare not run again

400
00:32:05,276 --> 00:32:09,838
Please stop, please

401
00:32:18,055 --> 00:32:21,047
Do you remember
the location of Zhao camp?

402
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,118
We don't know

403
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:28,828
When we saw the Zhao's sentry

404
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,390
we just turn and run

405
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,169
Sir, Zhao's Commander Xiang Yanzhong

406
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,141
wants to meet with you at the South Gate

407
00:33:11,042 --> 00:33:13,237
War on a board game?

408
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,542
So we know where we stand

409
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,706
Please

410
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,418
Please

411
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,578
Commander

412
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,714
Just to check you out

413
00:33:59,757 --> 00:34:01,725
you certainly are a fine catch

414
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:07,522
Small defeat means nothing,
it's just a board game

415
00:34:09,767 --> 00:34:12,099
It isn't worth

416
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:15,697
wasting Commander's time on Liang

417
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,037
right?

418
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:20,107
It won't cost much

419
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,909
I'm not done yet

420
00:34:27,685 --> 00:34:29,482
Neither am I

421
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:35,355
See you in the battlefield

422
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:46,601
General

423
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:48,903
Thank you, My Lord

424
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:59,845
I'd changed my words in surrendering

425
00:34:59,884 --> 00:35:03,911
and I'd hand over all commands to Ge Li

426
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:06,548
General, I hope you won't take offence...

427
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,989
My Lord, I really don't mind

428
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:11,654
General...

429
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,253
Your servant is loyal to your majesty

430
00:35:13,297 --> 00:35:16,266
I'm always at your command

431
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:21,367
I appreciate your generalship

432
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,541
and your understanding

433
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:32,706
General Niu, you're
always my great General

434
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,685
This battle is critical for Liang

435
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:40,980
If we can defend Zhao's first attack

436
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:43,255
Liang will have hope

437
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,060
Any questions?

438
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:46,460
No

439
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:47,464
We'll get everything ready

440
00:35:47,498 --> 00:35:49,523
So, dismiss and prepare for the battle

441
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,829
Yes

442
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,863
Sir...

443
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:57,305
Mr. Ge Li...

444
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:59,198
What is it?

445
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:01,302
Cavalry troop is not yet
assigned with any work

446
00:36:01,946 --> 00:36:04,471
Cavalry troops belong to the royal guards

447
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:05,948
I've no rights to command

448
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,348
Don't argue anymore

449
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:11,778
Usually...

450
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:16,320
People flee from war

451
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,394
do you really know what war is?

452
00:36:20,431 --> 00:36:22,456
This is my homeland

453
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,060
When my father was still alive

454
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:27,195
he was always on the front line

455
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:28,762
I don't want to be despised

456
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:31,331
just because I'm a girl...

457
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:38,273
There's one very important job...

458
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:47,583
You're responsible for the square

459
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,526
Collect them to
the City East for distribution

460
00:36:50,561 --> 00:36:53,553
We don't have much time,
the rest come with me

461
00:36:53,597 --> 00:36:54,723
Yes

462
00:37:01,238 --> 00:37:03,331
Wake up, everybody

463
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:05,569
By the command of Mr. Ge Li

464
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:08,737
give us all your excrement now

465
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:10,770
give us all your excrement

466
00:37:10,814 --> 00:37:12,247
I can't take this anymore

467
00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:15,745
I'm really cracked up

468
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,556
The Zhaos...

469
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:24,220
when will they attack?

470
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,968
Are they... waiting for us?

471
00:37:42,913 --> 00:37:44,710
That's impossible

472
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:48,149
Ge Li is no dummy...

473
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:49,550
We've to think it through

474
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:51,316
We can't wait anymore

475
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:53,755
They'll really kill them all

476
00:37:55,926 --> 00:37:59,794
Don't you know our wives
and kids will all be dead?

477
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,491
Quiet

478
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:04,399
We're here all because of your wife...

479
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,027
Forget it... it's over already...

480
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,731
it's over

481
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:17,738
...I killed my own child, he is still in...

482
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,009
It's over already

483
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:20,681
Everybody get up

484
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,111
and follow me out

485
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:25,314
What's going on here?

486
00:38:25,356 --> 00:38:27,290
- What is it?
- Get up! Quick

487
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,616
Keep quiet

488
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,718
Quiet

489
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,194
What's going on here?

490
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:34,959
You... shut up

491
00:38:34,999 --> 00:38:37,365
For no matter what reasons you're here

492
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:39,369
from now on

493
00:38:40,137 --> 00:38:42,970
no one will care

494
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,672
You'll be sent to the front line of the battle

495
00:38:45,709 --> 00:38:48,269
to fight against your enemies

496
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,072
Defeat your enemies

497
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:52,405
and you'll be freed

498
00:38:52,449 --> 00:38:53,780
We're innocent

499
00:38:53,817 --> 00:38:55,546
why do we have to give our lives?

500
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:59,283
Who are not victims in a war?
Answer me

501
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:08,587
Your anger and rages

502
00:39:08,632 --> 00:39:10,930
your freedom...

503
00:39:10,968 --> 00:39:13,300
is in your hands now

504
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,271
Fight for yourselves

505
00:39:15,305 --> 00:39:17,637
and the innocents

506
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,941
Freedom is more valued only if

507
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,845
you defeat your enemies, understand?

508
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:31,015
Set

509
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,823
Shoot

510
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:40,095
Alignment

511
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:42,423
Shoot

512
00:39:51,575 --> 00:39:54,169
Hurry up, pass around the arrows

513
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:13,289
Look

514
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,161
The excrement really works

515
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,826
it puts out the fire

516
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,233
Spread more on the other roof tops

517
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,688
Front attack

518
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:56,668
Invade South Gate

519
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,073
Invade South Gate

520
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:58,498
Everybody get up and fight

521
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:08,577
Pour the sulphur

522
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:43,535
Shoot

523
00:42:59,029 --> 00:43:00,519
Give me the stone

524
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:06,164
Pass it along to the wall

525
00:43:06,203 --> 00:43:07,033
Yes

526
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,331
Hurry up

527
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:16,009
Move

528
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:25,413
Come with me

529
00:43:50,514 --> 00:43:52,175
I'm not, not me

530
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:56,916
My Prince, there are
Zhao spies in the town

531
00:44:39,563 --> 00:44:41,121
Dong

532
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:03,810
Go

533
00:45:15,665 --> 00:45:17,360
You shouldn't be here...

534
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:20,934
You shouldn't...

535
00:45:21,738 --> 00:45:24,866
Get back inside the Gate

536
00:46:04,881 --> 00:46:06,007
Shoot

537
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:41,710
Bulwark had been taken,
two units are moving in

538
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:44,549
South gate was opened, we are moving in

539
00:46:49,459 --> 00:46:50,585
You stay behind

540
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:51,787
Yes

541
00:47:04,374 --> 00:47:06,274
Raise the drawbridge

542
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:07,640
Hurry up

543
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:15,645
Pull it

544
00:47:58,094 --> 00:47:59,561
The drawbridge got stuck

545
00:47:59,596 --> 00:48:01,086
we can't get out and rescue Ge Li

546
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:09,565
Attack

547
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:12,366
Three units are approaching

548
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:15,411
Focus the attack in the Bulwark

549
00:48:15,445 --> 00:48:17,276
Cover Ge Li. Go

550
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:17,701
Shoot! Just shoot

551
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:18,799
Draw back

552
00:49:28,084 --> 00:49:29,449
Ge Li

553
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,985
- Shoot him
- Pull

554
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:49,029
Close the gate

555
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,369
Remove the bodies, quick

556
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,533
Close the gate

557
00:49:51,574 --> 00:49:52,541
Hurry up

558
00:49:52,575 --> 00:49:54,304
Close the gate

559
00:50:05,155 --> 00:50:07,180
Tear down Liang

560
00:50:26,643 --> 00:50:28,975
Protect Commander

561
00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:37,318
Close the gate

562
00:50:37,754 --> 00:50:39,016
Stop crying

563
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,912
Close the Gate

564
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,356
Quick

565
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:43,449
Move back

566
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,484
What sound is that? Quiet

567
00:50:45,528 --> 00:50:46,119
Come with me

568
00:50:46,162 --> 00:50:47,459
Quiet

569
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:49,124
Zhao's retreating drum sound

570
00:50:49,165 --> 00:50:50,792
- Zhao is retreating
- Really?

571
00:50:50,834 --> 00:50:53,496
They're retreating, we've made it

572
00:50:53,536 --> 00:50:57,529
The Zhao's retreating

573
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:10,171
Stay in bed

574
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:11,976
tend to your wounds

575
00:52:12,649 --> 00:52:13,775
I'm fine

576
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:18,187
Where am I?

577
00:52:20,256 --> 00:52:21,883
Dong's room

578
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:24,649
I'm sorry

579
00:52:26,095 --> 00:52:27,790
He can finally relieve...

580
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,298
only that he cannot die in peace...

581
00:52:40,643 --> 00:52:41,974
Brand new

582
00:52:42,979 --> 00:52:46,437
It's okay, I'm fine with what I have

583
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:48,644
It isn't worth much

584
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:50,346
please keep it

585
00:52:51,654 --> 00:52:56,648
Mozi shouldn't accept gifts

586
00:52:56,693 --> 00:52:58,320
or else

587
00:52:58,361 --> 00:53:02,593
people will think we are
helping others for their return

588
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:04,259
Not accepting gifts

589
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,860
doesn't mean no one suspect you

590
00:53:19,182 --> 00:53:20,774
Wait...

591
00:53:22,819 --> 00:53:24,411
You'd better stay in here

592
00:53:24,454 --> 00:53:25,944
there're lots of people outside

593
00:53:27,123 --> 00:53:29,785
Mr. Ge Li has recovered

594
00:53:41,204 --> 00:53:45,436
Commander, we can't
postpone attacking Yan

595
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,204
My suggestion is...

596
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:50,076
Let's leave 4,000 soldiers guarding Liang

597
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:53,776
they'll surrender when they
run out of food and water

598
00:53:53,816 --> 00:53:55,044
then...

599
00:53:55,084 --> 00:53:58,247
we can then
take revenge for General Gao

600
00:53:58,288 --> 00:54:00,756
Commander, what do you think?

601
00:54:02,392 --> 00:54:05,384
This battle is no longer a personal affair

602
00:54:05,428 --> 00:54:08,158
Liang seems meaningless to us, but...

603
00:54:08,197 --> 00:54:10,665
we under-estimated our enemies,
and were defeated

604
00:54:11,901 --> 00:54:13,630
You think...

605
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:17,231
we can defeat Yan
with our dispirited troops?

606
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:19,366
Do we have this courage?

607
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:25,875
I would like to have
opinions from other Generals

608
00:55:05,088 --> 00:55:08,023
This dagger has poison

609
00:55:08,057 --> 00:55:10,252
someone dropped it into my house

610
00:55:10,293 --> 00:55:12,454
They're already here...

611
00:55:12,495 --> 00:55:14,588
even if we don't do it...

612
00:55:15,264 --> 00:55:18,529
they'll do it

613
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:32,241
You don't want to kill Ge Li, right?

614
00:55:33,583 --> 00:55:35,847
You must have forgotten
your wife and son...

615
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:38,284
No

616
00:55:38,321 --> 00:55:40,949
he came here to protect us

617
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,855
How can we do that?

618
00:55:45,028 --> 00:55:46,290
Protect us?

619
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:48,058
He is giving up our lives

620
00:55:48,097 --> 00:55:50,065
by putting us in the front line?

621
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:53,557
We're just lucky to be still alive

622
00:55:54,637 --> 00:55:57,401
Even if we'd killed Ge Li...

623
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,204
can we save our families?

624
00:56:00,243 --> 00:56:02,768
If we kill Ge Li...

625
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:05,280
who's going to save Liang?

626
00:56:10,186 --> 00:56:11,380
I know where he is...

627
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:25,260
Take it

628
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:26,427
Go

629
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:27,595
Go

630
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:34,442
Everybody listen

631
00:56:34,477 --> 00:56:35,910
no matter what, armor or swords

632
00:56:35,945 --> 00:56:38,812
collect all the useful stuffs

633
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,917
What are you doing?

634
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:51,720
Why do you want to kill me?

635
00:56:51,761 --> 00:56:52,386
Drop the knife

636
00:56:52,428 --> 00:56:54,157
Stay away

637
00:56:54,197 --> 00:56:56,688
Guards

638
00:56:59,235 --> 00:57:00,634
Drop the weapon

639
00:57:09,946 --> 00:57:12,073
Mr. Ge Li, he's dead

640
00:57:22,992 --> 00:57:25,893
I've one important announcement today

641
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:27,793
But before I announce

642
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,855
let's give a...

643
00:57:29,899 --> 00:57:32,527
silent meditation to Pu Le,
who died yesterday

644
00:57:34,737 --> 00:57:36,796
As usual

645
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:39,173
close your eyes

646
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,267
until the 10th stroke

647
00:57:54,056 --> 00:57:55,318
Traitor

648
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,156
Little girl...

649
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:06,463
don't be afraid

650
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:11,195
why do you have to come to Liang?

651
00:58:12,842 --> 00:58:15,936
It must be the Zhao
assigned her to kill Mr. Ge Li

652
00:58:15,978 --> 00:58:18,037
Right, why do you want to kill Mr. Ge Li

653
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,445
Quiet

654
00:58:22,218 --> 00:58:23,947
Bastard, how dare you are

655
00:58:23,986 --> 00:58:28,116
Don't let her go! Kill her

656
00:58:28,157 --> 00:58:29,249
Stop

657
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:30,826
Back off

658
00:58:31,427 --> 00:58:32,621
Back off

659
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,184
Mr. Ge Li

660
00:59:31,387 --> 00:59:32,877
Where are you going?

661
00:59:36,058 --> 00:59:37,685
I'd like to make myself clear

662
00:59:39,095 --> 00:59:42,553
Mozi will not accept any gifts

663
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:45,858
Thanks for your gesture

664
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:29,472
Sir

665
01:00:29,506 --> 01:00:31,269
Why do you follow me?

666
01:00:31,308 --> 01:00:33,538
You nearly got killed! Go back

667
01:00:35,112 --> 01:00:37,410
Aren't you going to spy on Zhao Camp?

668
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:39,142
I always came here riding with the horses

669
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:40,911
I'm familiar with this area

670
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,816
Follow me

671
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:46,179
You're not going

672
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,582
This way is the shortcut

673
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:58,563
What are they carrying?

674
01:00:58,602 --> 01:01:00,092
Soil

675
01:01:00,137 --> 01:01:02,264
They're digging a tunnel...

676
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:06,532
To Liang?

677
01:01:15,485 --> 01:01:17,282
Why are they dumping it into the stream?

678
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,756
The stream will wash away the soil

679
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:24,586
then, no one will know

680
01:01:24,628 --> 01:01:28,394
how far they had dug

681
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:30,059
Let's go

682
01:01:31,068 --> 01:01:32,433
Someone is up there

683
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:46,376
There they are

684
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:47,781
Get them

685
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:04,567
Can you swim?

686
01:02:08,839 --> 01:02:10,602
Go, don't worry about me

687
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:11,800
Go, quick

688
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:17,969
Stop running

689
01:02:18,014 --> 01:02:20,209
Surrender or you'll die here

690
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,182
You'll have to save me

691
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:24,517
Move

692
01:03:12,335 --> 01:03:13,302
Breathe

693
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:16,800
You're...

694
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,467
very brave

695
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:22,338
If I didn't jump...

696
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,038
would you jump?

697
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,605
I would

698
01:03:26,650 --> 01:03:28,675
But I'll kill you first

699
01:03:30,353 --> 01:03:32,947
Is that what you Mozi
would have done sanely?

700
01:03:33,657 --> 01:03:36,148
You think killing you is rational?

701
01:03:36,193 --> 01:03:37,888
How are you going to kill me?

702
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:44,261
Push you down the waterfall

703
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:49,533
Do you feel better now?

704
01:03:49,573 --> 01:03:51,370
Can you walk by yourself?

705
01:04:02,652 --> 01:04:04,449
Quiet

706
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,389
There's nothing
in the West City and the barn

707
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:14,363
where are they going to attack?

708
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:18,259
They'll dig a few tunnels,
there'll be more than one exit

709
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:21,566
we can't be sure whether
we had blocked them all

710
01:04:23,306 --> 01:04:25,433
I'm not blocking them off

711
01:04:25,475 --> 01:04:26,874
I'm letting them in

712
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,070
No

713
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:31,205
they must be collaborating
with the force outside

714
01:04:32,182 --> 01:04:34,013
I know

715
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:37,178
we're going to defeat
our enemies in a dragnet

716
01:04:37,821 --> 01:04:39,049
After ten days

717
01:04:39,089 --> 01:04:43,719
we can dig three tunnels
in here, here and here

718
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:44,920
Commander, what do you think?

719
01:04:44,961 --> 01:04:47,054
Can you speed up the process?

720
01:04:47,097 --> 01:04:50,555
If our soldiers can enter the City

721
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,864
Liang will not be able to defend

722
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:56,932
Three days later

723
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:59,134
will be the advent of winter

724
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:02,167
Longer night time
is an advantage for our attack

725
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:03,179
Commander

726
01:05:03,213 --> 01:05:07,741
Someone was spying on us
a few days ago...

727
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:10,275
The longer we take

728
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:14,154
our enemies may
find out the tunnel exits

729
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:16,283
Gather all the slaves

730
01:05:18,795 --> 01:05:20,160
three days later

731
01:05:20,196 --> 01:05:22,960
we'll attack from here

732
01:06:24,894 --> 01:06:26,589
Warriors, get ready

733
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:46,879
Commander...

734
01:07:05,402 --> 01:07:07,427
The exit was blocked, move back

735
01:07:09,873 --> 01:07:13,070
Attack

736
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:16,338
Pull

737
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:42,101
Drop your weapons

738
01:07:42,138 --> 01:07:43,867
and your lives will be spared

739
01:08:02,692 --> 01:08:04,853
They're here

740
01:08:08,198 --> 01:08:10,257
I'm just a slave

741
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:11,767
I don't want to come

742
01:08:11,801 --> 01:08:12,495
Stop him

743
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:13,900
let me go

744
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:15,931
Kill him

745
01:08:15,972 --> 01:08:17,371
What are you doing? Please let her down

746
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:20,839
Stay back

747
01:08:20,877 --> 01:08:24,574
Please... please, let her go...

748
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:29,977
Please... please, let her go...

749
01:08:30,787 --> 01:08:32,755
Please... don't...

750
01:08:32,789 --> 01:08:34,586
he'll really kill my sister

751
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:36,353
The Zhao force me

752
01:08:36,392 --> 01:08:37,552
I don't want to come

753
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:38,583
Please, please...

754
01:08:38,628 --> 01:08:40,027
Please give her back to me

755
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:44,090
Please let her down

756
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:44,997
Stay back

757
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:46,899
No please

758
01:08:48,404 --> 01:08:49,962
Let her go...

759
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:52,201
let the child go

760
01:08:52,242 --> 01:08:53,209
She's innocent

761
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:55,711
I just know how to dig tunnels

762
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,679
they force me to come

763
01:08:59,148 --> 01:09:00,672
Get ready

764
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:02,615
Kill

765
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,248
Shoot

766
01:09:13,897 --> 01:09:15,831
Defeating enemies in a dragnet

767
01:09:26,709 --> 01:09:27,971
Quiet

768
01:09:28,011 --> 01:09:29,478
Xiao Xiao, it's okay

769
01:09:30,914 --> 01:09:32,176
Let go of the child

770
01:09:32,949 --> 01:09:34,974
I promise

771
01:09:35,018 --> 01:09:37,213
no one will hurt you

772
01:09:40,323 --> 01:09:41,790
Give her to me

773
01:09:41,824 --> 01:09:43,849
Please...

774
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:45,622
Give me

775
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:54,833
Xiao-xiao...

776
01:09:54,871 --> 01:09:57,032
Xiao-xiao...

777
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:01,402
Stop

778
01:10:02,178 --> 01:10:02,837
Let him go

779
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:04,435
Stop

780
01:10:06,282 --> 01:10:07,078
Stop

781
01:10:08,251 --> 01:10:09,218
Stop

782
01:10:10,486 --> 01:10:11,612
Stop

783
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:15,550
Move back

784
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:17,317
Move back

785
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,327
Everybody back

786
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,623
Everybody move back

787
01:10:19,662 --> 01:10:20,458
Sir, are you alright?

788
01:10:20,496 --> 01:10:21,554
I'm fine

789
01:10:21,598 --> 01:10:23,122
All of you assemble at the Square

790
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:25,100
Hurry Up! Go

791
01:10:25,134 --> 01:10:27,500
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

792
01:11:05,842 --> 01:11:07,469
Let's go back

793
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:15,207
Don't come back

794
01:11:16,185 --> 01:11:20,053
Go along the stream, you'll not be found

795
01:11:25,228 --> 01:11:27,560
Why don't you kill me?

796
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:36,032
Why do you ask such a foolish question?

797
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,267
Why...

798
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:43,403
should people kill each other?

799
01:11:55,358 --> 01:11:58,156
I must take revenge for you

800
01:11:59,796 --> 01:12:02,560
It's all my fault

801
01:12:02,598 --> 01:12:06,500
I shouldn't make you suffer

802
01:12:06,536 --> 01:12:09,130
They're inhuman

803
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,488
Congratulations on
your astounding victory

804
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:37,158
The King would like to reward you

805
01:12:38,701 --> 01:12:40,396
Please come with me to the Palace

806
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:45,332
Reward?

807
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:49,840
General Niu...

808
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:53,337
can't you see all these dead bodies?

809
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,349
They were our enemies

810
01:12:55,384 --> 01:12:57,409
Aren't they humans?

811
01:12:58,521 --> 01:13:03,151
When enemies is trying to kill me

812
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:06,753
I'll have to defend or even kill him

813
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,431
but killing someone because of hatred...

814
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,400
it's absolutely wrong

815
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:15,199
What a pity

816
01:13:15,705 --> 01:13:19,505
Every man has his weak point

817
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:24,206
Mozi Philosophy is not
for ruling a country

818
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:30,408
This Mozi clan will fall...

819
01:13:35,458 --> 01:13:37,255
I'd like to be excused

820
01:13:38,027 --> 01:13:41,827
You seem very appreciative of Ge Li

821
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,498
I acknowledge his defending skills

822
01:13:46,536 --> 01:13:50,097
That's where it should end

823
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:56,374
Mozi philosophy is only
applicable in times of war

824
01:13:56,412 --> 01:14:01,440
They're not suitable in times of peace

825
01:14:01,484 --> 01:14:04,282
You must be clear on this

826
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,756
Yes, my Lord is right

827
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,280
Understood

828
01:14:18,234 --> 01:14:20,065
Watch him closely

829
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:20,659
Yes

830
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,933
don't let him getting off the track

831
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:24,462
Yes

832
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:26,304
General Niu

833
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:27,104
Yes

834
01:14:27,143 --> 01:14:29,168
you must pay close attention

835
01:14:29,212 --> 01:14:33,205
all those revolting thoughts

836
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:35,740
shall never spread in Liang

837
01:14:35,785 --> 01:14:36,752
Yes

838
01:14:53,102 --> 01:14:54,729
Are you okay?

839
01:14:58,474 --> 01:14:59,941
I'm fine

840
01:15:03,112 --> 01:15:04,841
The weather is getting cold...

841
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:06,371
I know you don't have
any warm clothing...

842
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:09,976
so I took out my father's coat
and see if it fits or not

843
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:12,544
I can adjust it...

844
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:16,151
Just fit, thanks

845
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,685
I'll return it when I leave

846
01:15:22,098 --> 01:15:24,089
When?

847
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:27,301
I'll leave when this battle is over

848
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:31,305
The battle should be over soon...

849
01:15:31,908 --> 01:15:33,170
very soon

850
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,616
Did you go to the Square last night?

851
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:49,281
No

852
01:15:49,325 --> 01:15:52,783
You assigned me
to keep guard in the North

853
01:15:52,828 --> 01:15:55,092
I'd heard the Zhao army was defeated

854
01:15:55,131 --> 01:15:57,190
Many of them died...

855
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:02,500
lots of them

856
01:16:04,974 --> 01:16:07,135
They're still...

857
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:10,869
moving their bodies out for burial

858
01:16:12,548 --> 01:16:16,484
Defeating enemies
in a dragnet... is that right?

859
01:16:37,173 --> 01:16:38,470
I remembered

860
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:41,965
my father told me this
when I was a little girl...

861
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:48,881
When you start questioning
what is right or wrong

862
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,944
you are uncertain with
your faith and beliefs

863
01:17:05,267 --> 01:17:08,202
Is it only war can make you stay?

864
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:15,408
I thought...

865
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:17,969
you are always looking for peace

866
01:17:31,594 --> 01:17:33,118
Sorry...

867
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:37,689
What for?

868
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:54,311
You're always like that...

869
01:17:56,419 --> 01:17:59,855
You're so protective with everything you do

870
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:03,823
You always ask whether you're right or not

871
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:09,090
Is it really that important?

872
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:11,899
Even if you know it's right

873
01:18:11,934 --> 01:18:15,028
but for some people...

874
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:17,369
they prefers to be wrong

875
01:18:20,209 --> 01:18:22,370
I would want to tell you

876
01:18:23,579 --> 01:18:25,843
no matter it's right or wrong

877
01:18:27,249 --> 01:18:29,740
I just want to be with you

878
01:18:36,392 --> 01:18:40,226
You talk about universal love all the time

879
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,133
You should know how to love

880
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:47,592
you know

881
01:18:56,979 --> 01:18:58,276
Ge Li arrives...

882
01:18:58,314 --> 01:18:59,906
Liang will survive

883
01:18:59,949 --> 01:19:01,678
Ge Li stays...

884
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:03,617
Liang will be safe

885
01:19:03,652 --> 01:19:04,949
Ge Li goes...

886
01:19:04,987 --> 01:19:07,080
Liang cannot hold

887
01:19:07,123 --> 01:19:09,057
How about if Ge Li leaves?

888
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:20,034
Just those small pieces?

889
01:19:21,203 --> 01:19:23,398
Anyway, melt it quickly

890
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:33,873
Commander

891
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:44,456
It is time to retreat

892
01:19:49,798 --> 01:19:52,961
News from our spy who
returned from Zhao Nation

893
01:19:53,002 --> 01:19:54,469
Proceed

894
01:19:55,004 --> 01:19:56,699
News from Zhao Nation

895
01:19:56,739 --> 01:19:58,400
The King of Qi has ordered
an army of 200,000

896
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:00,408
setting off five days ago
to attack Zhao Nation

897
01:20:00,442 --> 01:20:02,672
Zhao Nation is preparing for the war

898
01:20:03,846 --> 01:20:05,609
Thanks for your majesty's blessing

899
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:07,013
If that is the case

900
01:20:07,049 --> 01:20:09,882
Xiang Yanzhong will be called back

901
01:20:09,919 --> 01:20:11,978
Liang will be saved

902
01:20:12,021 --> 01:20:14,285
Liang will be saved

903
01:20:15,457 --> 01:20:20,360
However, the news of
Zhao's retreat must not spread

904
01:20:20,396 --> 01:20:21,761
I plead My Lord

905
01:20:21,797 --> 01:20:26,200
to withdraw all power from
Ge Li immediately

906
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:27,725
otherwise, people will think it is Ge Li

907
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:31,103
who defeated the Zhao troops

908
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:33,734
We have to demolish any chance

909
01:20:33,776 --> 01:20:39,408
for Ge Li's supporters to rebel

910
01:20:40,249 --> 01:20:44,618
You think Ge Li will rebel, General?

911
01:20:45,788 --> 01:20:47,619
I don't think so

912
01:20:47,656 --> 01:20:49,419
Why are you so sure?

913
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:50,117
Because...

914
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:52,389
Because there is no such need

915
01:20:53,295 --> 01:20:57,095
Ge Li's popularity

916
01:20:57,132 --> 01:20:59,100
is now higher than the King

917
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:02,233
he doesn't need to do a thing

918
01:21:03,172 --> 01:21:04,434
Right?

919
01:21:09,445 --> 01:21:14,883
Someone defending Liang
under false pretenses

920
01:21:15,618 --> 01:21:22,046
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

921
01:21:22,091 --> 01:21:24,719
Doesn't it sound the same as rebel?

922
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,160
General, what do you think?

923
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:33,458
I agree with Royal Tutor
but lack of evidence

924
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:35,202
General Niu

925
01:21:35,237 --> 01:21:36,033
Yes

926
01:21:36,071 --> 01:21:37,538
if you restores your military power

927
01:21:38,207 --> 01:21:42,701
would you be able to put down the riot?

928
01:21:43,846 --> 01:21:46,940
And arrest all the rebels?

929
01:22:38,801 --> 01:22:40,359
They're back

930
01:22:41,503 --> 01:22:42,902
How's it?

931
01:22:54,717 --> 01:22:55,877
Commander

932
01:22:58,887 --> 01:23:02,186
Liang must think that we had retreated

933
01:23:02,224 --> 01:23:06,456
We're just left with 1,000 soldiers

934
01:23:07,062 --> 01:23:08,757
Commander

935
01:23:09,431 --> 01:23:12,457
shall we call back part of
our army for the attack?

936
01:23:13,435 --> 01:23:15,562
Victory will come

937
01:23:16,338 --> 01:23:18,670
when there's no way to retreat

938
01:23:19,341 --> 01:23:22,242
This battle has to be fast and clear

939
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,837
We'll end this up with Ge Li

940
01:24:00,616 --> 01:24:02,277
New boots?

941
01:24:14,696 --> 01:24:16,220
No problem, Mr. Ge Li

942
01:24:16,265 --> 01:24:18,495
it will be ready when you come back

943
01:24:20,335 --> 01:24:23,862
I disagreed on the massacre last night, but...

944
01:24:23,906 --> 01:24:26,067
You can't stop them...

945
01:24:28,177 --> 01:24:30,475
I always think that killing enemies
is a kind of glory...

946
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,242
where will you go after the battle ends?

947
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,945
Wherever needs me, I'll be there

948
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:50,024
What if Zhao is being
invaded and ask for your help

949
01:24:50,065 --> 01:24:51,726
will you go?

950
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,394
Of course I would

951
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,029
You've wiped out their army

952
01:24:57,739 --> 01:25:00,173
then turn around and save their lives?

953
01:25:00,209 --> 01:25:02,336
Those you'd defeated before...

954
01:25:02,377 --> 01:25:04,777
will they accept your help?

955
01:25:08,617 --> 01:25:10,551
Frankly speaking

956
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,447
I'm never sure

957
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:16,683
whether those people I had helped

958
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:21,089
really appreciate what I've done for them...

959
01:25:22,631 --> 01:25:27,193
Then, Mozi's universal love
is just blind talking?

960
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:32,633
Nothing is perfect

961
01:25:33,442 --> 01:25:35,307
I just want no regrets in my life

962
01:25:36,678 --> 01:25:38,145
Blacksmith

963
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:41,843
is the pot ready?

964
01:25:41,884 --> 01:25:42,908
Sure

965
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:45,351
Mr. Ge Li is a true hero

966
01:25:45,387 --> 01:25:47,082
He's humble and skilled

967
01:25:47,122 --> 01:25:50,819
Just the opposite to our royals

968
01:25:51,093 --> 01:25:54,460
If our King got a bit of his talent

969
01:25:54,496 --> 01:25:57,021
Liang will be undefeatable

970
01:26:00,235 --> 01:26:01,429
Mr. Ge Li

971
01:26:02,137 --> 01:26:03,365
Mr. Ge Li

972
01:26:03,405 --> 01:26:04,633
we are all set

973
01:26:04,673 --> 01:26:05,799
Let's go

974
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:07,934
Is this really going to work?

975
01:26:07,976 --> 01:26:09,876
That's psychological tactic

976
01:26:09,912 --> 01:26:13,313
Can you really cook Zhao food?

977
01:26:13,348 --> 01:26:16,715
I can guarantee that
the Zhaos will be miss home-

978
01:26:16,752 --> 01:26:18,049
Here are the firewoods

979
01:26:18,086 --> 01:26:19,053
Put it here

980
01:26:20,255 --> 01:26:20,949
Thank you

981
01:26:20,989 --> 01:26:22,650
Pass me the seasoning

982
01:26:22,691 --> 01:26:23,885
Mr. Ge Li...

983
01:26:26,762 --> 01:26:27,694
How is it?

984
01:26:27,729 --> 01:26:29,856
There's no one is the Zhao camp

985
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:30,523
They retreated?

986
01:26:30,566 --> 01:26:32,796
Yes. It's abandoned. Nothing's there

987
01:26:32,834 --> 01:26:35,496
You guys first go back.
I'll go and check it out

988
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:40,340
Come on

989
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:41,740
Let's have some meat

990
01:26:43,979 --> 01:26:46,106
Is that Zhao's food? What a great smell

991
01:26:48,951 --> 01:26:50,282
Open the Gate

992
01:26:50,319 --> 01:26:51,946
Ge Li is back

993
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:11,235
By order of the Royal Court

994
01:27:11,273 --> 01:27:15,039
Ge Li is defending Liang under false pretenses

995
01:27:15,077 --> 01:27:19,013
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

996
01:27:19,047 --> 01:27:21,481
Be arrested, otherwise

997
01:27:21,516 --> 01:27:22,778
you will be killed

998
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,055
General...

999
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:44,201
Ge Li!

1000
01:27:50,612 --> 01:27:52,807
I'd always suspected your motives

1001
01:27:56,985 --> 01:27:59,852
How dare you seize my land

1002
01:28:00,555 --> 01:28:02,614
I'm going to kill you today

1003
01:28:08,530 --> 01:28:09,690
Take me hostage

1004
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,367
My Prince...

1005
01:28:13,402 --> 01:28:14,699
Thank you

1006
01:28:14,736 --> 01:28:16,636
Draw back

1007
01:28:19,307 --> 01:28:20,399
Move back

1008
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:22,968
Open the Gate

1009
01:28:23,011 --> 01:28:24,376
Open the Gate

1010
01:28:33,255 --> 01:28:36,053
Ge Li, let go my Prince

1011
01:28:36,091 --> 01:28:37,649
the King will pardon you

1012
01:28:43,799 --> 01:28:46,029
Prepare Ge Li's arrows

1013
01:28:46,068 --> 01:28:47,194
Yes sir

1014
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:59,372
Thank you

1015
01:28:59,414 --> 01:29:02,247
Mr. Ge Li

1016
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:04,813
Sir...

1017
01:29:06,488 --> 01:29:08,285
may I follow by your side?

1018
01:29:10,826 --> 01:29:12,225
You should go back

1019
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:15,058
Staying in Liang is much more important

1020
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:16,587
Don't you wish to see more people

1021
01:29:16,631 --> 01:29:19,623
passing on Mozi's thought of peace?

1022
01:29:23,405 --> 01:29:24,770
Remember

1023
01:29:24,806 --> 01:29:26,364
those who know how to defend a city

1024
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:28,239
cannot bring peace to the world

1025
01:29:28,276 --> 01:29:33,873
Peace lies on the kings of all nations

1026
01:29:33,915 --> 01:29:35,041
Understand?

1027
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,519
Ge Li, release the Prince

1028
01:29:39,955 --> 01:29:41,855
Ge Li had released me

1029
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:43,152
I'm coming back

1030
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:44,488
Stop

1031
01:29:44,526 --> 01:29:45,652
Sir

1032
01:29:53,268 --> 01:29:54,360
Thank you

1033
01:29:55,203 --> 01:29:56,033
Let's go

1034
01:29:56,071 --> 01:29:57,936
We're not going back

1035
01:29:57,973 --> 01:29:59,372
Where're you guys going?

1036
01:29:59,407 --> 01:30:00,237
Let's go home

1037
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:01,537
We've got no home

1038
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:05,275
The Prince is coming back

1039
01:30:05,313 --> 01:30:06,473
Get ready

1040
01:30:06,515 --> 01:30:07,982
Yes

1041
01:30:08,016 --> 01:30:09,506
Aren't they...

1042
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:12,577
retreated already? Why...

1043
01:30:14,422 --> 01:30:16,390
What sound is that?

1044
01:30:16,424 --> 01:30:19,291
Shoot as far as you can

1045
01:30:19,327 --> 01:30:20,589
Run

1046
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:21,687
Quick

1047
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:25,928
Fire

1048
01:30:32,507 --> 01:30:33,974
Run

1049
01:30:38,346 --> 01:30:40,746
Mr. Ge Li

1050
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:43,307
Don't come back, go

1051
01:30:44,286 --> 01:30:45,776
Go

1052
01:31:03,038 --> 01:31:04,699
Search for the bodies

1053
01:31:04,739 --> 01:31:06,172
Come with me

1054
01:31:15,917 --> 01:31:20,411
My Lordship Liang Shi has fallen

1055
01:31:21,122 --> 01:31:23,215
Your servant has killed
the Prince by accident

1056
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:25,351
I'll never be forgiven

1057
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:31,196
However, Liang is still
under the threat of riot

1058
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:33,394
I plead with you my Lord

1059
01:31:33,435 --> 01:31:36,563
to let me accomplish
my mission in a hundred days

1060
01:31:36,605 --> 01:31:38,800
I swear I can eliminate all Ge Li's league

1061
01:31:41,509 --> 01:31:43,033
I will take my punishment after that

1062
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:49,650
Please, My Lord

1063
01:31:51,419 --> 01:31:54,718
Liang Shi...

1064
01:31:54,756 --> 01:31:57,452
is my only son

1065
01:31:59,794 --> 01:32:02,820
he was the future of Liang

1066
01:32:05,433 --> 01:32:08,095
You ruined the future of Liang

1067
01:32:08,136 --> 01:32:10,297
Pardoning you?

1068
01:32:13,441 --> 01:32:16,467
That's ridiculous

1069
01:32:24,386 --> 01:32:26,547
But taking into account of your loyalty

1070
01:32:27,856 --> 01:32:32,088
and all you've done in defending Liang

1071
01:32:35,664 --> 01:32:37,655
moreover...

1072
01:32:39,367 --> 01:32:42,097
protection of Liang

1073
01:32:43,071 --> 01:32:46,302
cannot lie on outsiders

1074
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:55,081
I'm in a hard position

1075
01:32:57,919 --> 01:33:01,878
I'll accept your plea. Hundred days later

1076
01:33:03,758 --> 01:33:05,282
your accusation will be denounced

1077
01:33:07,629 --> 01:33:09,358
Thank you, My Lord

1078
01:33:26,414 --> 01:33:29,850
Why are you taking me?
What have I done?

1079
01:33:46,201 --> 01:33:48,669
General, what's happening here?

1080
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:50,603
The King's decree

1081
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:51,866
capture all the rebels

1082
01:33:58,480 --> 01:33:59,970
Rinse again with water

1083
01:34:03,218 --> 01:34:06,085
What have you asked me for, Sir?

1084
01:34:09,391 --> 01:34:11,120
The King ordered you to kill Ge Li

1085
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:13,252
Why didn't you shoot him last night?

1086
01:34:16,531 --> 01:34:18,089
Ge Li has done nothing wrong

1087
01:34:19,367 --> 01:34:21,358
He saved all the Liang people

1088
01:34:21,403 --> 01:34:22,870
You disobeyed the King's command

1089
01:34:26,474 --> 01:34:27,634
You will be punished

1090
01:34:27,675 --> 01:34:28,607
What do you guys want?

1091
01:34:28,643 --> 01:34:30,270
Let go of me

1092
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:31,278
Stop

1093
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:34,414
Stop

1094
01:35:05,847 --> 01:35:08,179
Sometimes, I really don't know...

1095
01:35:09,384 --> 01:35:11,352
what is cause and effect

1096
01:35:17,592 --> 01:35:18,957
There's no cause and effect

1097
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:26,532
You saved them,
and they turn against you

1098
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:31,235
Mozi...

1099
01:35:31,272 --> 01:35:34,002
doesn't ask for returns

1100
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:41,073
Are all Mozis like that?

1101
01:35:41,116 --> 01:35:44,415
How come you came here alone?

1102
01:35:46,521 --> 01:35:48,887
Mozi...

1103
01:35:48,923 --> 01:35:50,823
didn't send anyone to Liang

1104
01:35:54,562 --> 01:35:55,961
You came here on your own will?

1105
01:35:57,332 --> 01:36:00,130
How many cities can you protect?

1106
01:36:00,802 --> 01:36:04,033
There are never ending wars and battles

1107
01:36:04,072 --> 01:36:07,940
peace will only come

1108
01:36:07,976 --> 01:36:10,604
when the seven nations are united

1109
01:36:10,645 --> 01:36:13,341
I believe universal love

1110
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:15,747
is the only path towards peace

1111
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:24,656
Mozi's "universal love" is loving everyone

1112
01:36:24,692 --> 01:36:29,857
that means you don't know
whom you should love

1113
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:42,442
Where are you going?

1114
01:36:42,477 --> 01:36:43,671
To Liang

1115
01:36:43,711 --> 01:36:46,612
and let someone I love
know that I am safe

1116
01:36:50,952 --> 01:36:55,013
It's all underground stream here

1117
01:36:55,056 --> 01:36:56,250
and you're injured

1118
01:36:56,291 --> 01:36:59,192
It's too dangerous, I'll go for you

1119
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,671
Your Majesty

1120
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:17,405
these people were in league with Ge Li

1121
01:37:17,445 --> 01:37:18,673
They are traitors

1122
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:20,874
My Lord...

1123
01:37:20,915 --> 01:37:26,080
I have nothing to do with Ge Li

1124
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:30,648
I know nothing about his rebellion...

1125
01:37:32,527 --> 01:37:33,858
Immoral, selfish

1126
01:37:35,463 --> 01:37:37,522
When everyone praise Ge Li

1127
01:37:37,565 --> 01:37:40,329
respect him and listen to him

1128
01:37:40,368 --> 01:37:41,300
Will you say such things?

1129
01:37:41,336 --> 01:37:46,137
I'm just a farmer,
I just want to live my life

1130
01:37:46,174 --> 01:37:49,974
I don't care who's a hero

1131
01:37:50,011 --> 01:37:52,605
I just miss my family, my child

1132
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:56,708
my home... My Lord...

1133
01:37:57,852 --> 01:37:59,979
Your city is in great danger

1134
01:38:00,722 --> 01:38:04,351
and you are just self-seeking

1135
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:08,087
Don't you know
how many unfortunate lives

1136
01:38:08,129 --> 01:38:10,893
we had lost to save our city?

1137
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:12,866
Without Ge Li

1138
01:38:12,900 --> 01:38:14,925
we never would have been saved

1139
01:38:14,969 --> 01:38:16,459
Guard

1140
01:38:17,905 --> 01:38:19,167
Sir

1141
01:38:19,207 --> 01:38:19,901
Slap her

1142
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:20,873
Yes

1143
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:33,720
You are the descendants
of my loyal servant

1144
01:38:33,755 --> 01:38:38,590
and you grew up with my beloved son

1145
01:38:38,626 --> 01:38:42,960
I'll have mercy on you,
I'm granting you death

1146
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:45,898
you'll have a Royal funeral

1147
01:38:45,933 --> 01:38:49,630
you'll be honored as Calvary Princess

1148
01:38:49,671 --> 01:38:54,165
and buried with my beloved son...

1149
01:38:54,208 --> 01:38:55,766
It's all rubbish

1150
01:38:57,312 --> 01:38:59,439
You just want me

1151
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:02,938
to be a burial item in your son's tomb

1152
01:39:02,984 --> 01:39:05,350
You want all of us

1153
01:39:05,386 --> 01:39:08,287
to die under you verdict

1154
01:39:10,391 --> 01:39:12,359
so as to prove and

1155
01:39:12,393 --> 01:39:14,452
show your power

1156
01:39:14,495 --> 01:39:16,156
But if it wasn't Ge Li

1157
01:39:16,197 --> 01:39:19,291
and those who died in the war

1158
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,063
Would you still be able

1159
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:22,535
to abuse your people?

1160
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:24,037
Shut up

1161
01:39:26,207 --> 01:39:28,767
This girl no longer
belongs to the royal families

1162
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:31,802
She was in league with Ge Li

1163
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:34,474
She will be executed in the public...

1164
01:39:34,515 --> 01:39:36,915
ripped to shreds by five horses

1165
01:39:45,059 --> 01:39:46,026
Execute

1166
01:39:47,362 --> 01:39:48,886
Execute them all

1167
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,329
Yes

1168
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:51,389
Execution

1169
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:54,401
My Lord! My Lord

1170
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:05,775
Report to the King, Yi Yue was muted

1171
01:40:05,813 --> 01:40:06,780
Yes

1172
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:24,054
Warriors

1173
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:27,390
behind this slope, there is a city

1174
01:41:27,428 --> 01:41:30,295
in that city, there're 4,000 people

1175
01:41:30,832 --> 01:41:33,392
but under the ground outside this city

1176
01:41:33,434 --> 01:41:35,732
there're 5,000 warriors

1177
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:41,174
friends and brothers who came with us

1178
01:41:41,209 --> 01:41:43,404
we can't just leave them there

1179
01:41:44,111 --> 01:41:47,740
they were killed even after

1180
01:41:47,782 --> 01:41:50,478
throwing down their weapons

1181
01:41:50,518 --> 01:41:53,009
their bodies were even

1182
01:41:53,054 --> 01:41:55,784
tossed from the Wall...

1183
01:41:55,823 --> 01:42:00,658
we'll fight for our
fallen brothers to our last soldier

1184
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:20,713
Start

1185
01:42:33,694 --> 01:42:35,184
What's that?

1186
01:42:36,831 --> 01:42:39,800
Anything you want to say?

1187
01:42:57,852 --> 01:42:59,376
What did you see?

1188
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,751
There's nothing

1189
01:43:05,293 --> 01:43:06,817
Look! Over there

1190
01:43:09,230 --> 01:43:12,199
Zhao is attacking again

1191
01:43:12,233 --> 01:43:13,894
Shoot them

1192
01:43:19,073 --> 01:43:21,598
The Zhao's here...

1193
01:43:25,947 --> 01:43:26,777
Protect the King

1194
01:43:26,814 --> 01:43:27,974
Hurry up, protect the King

1195
01:43:28,015 --> 01:43:29,642
My Lord, this way

1196
01:43:30,685 --> 01:43:32,949
Get more soldiers up here

1197
01:43:35,856 --> 01:43:38,256
Wait! How about us?

1198
01:43:38,793 --> 01:43:41,057
All soldiers report to you captain

1199
01:43:43,164 --> 01:43:44,256
Bring her back to the prison

1200
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:47,295
Come with me

1201
01:44:00,214 --> 01:44:01,272
No! Stop

1202
01:44:01,315 --> 01:44:02,373
Stop

1203
01:44:02,416 --> 01:44:04,213
Stop shooting

1204
01:44:05,353 --> 01:44:07,014
Go, quick

1205
01:44:07,054 --> 01:44:08,180
Go

1206
01:44:11,826 --> 01:44:13,157
General...

1207
01:44:13,194 --> 01:44:15,628
General, let's go

1208
01:44:15,663 --> 01:44:17,221
Go?

1209
01:44:17,264 --> 01:44:19,926
This is betrayal

1210
01:44:21,502 --> 01:44:23,595
If you won't leave, neither will we

1211
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:28,607
General

1212
01:44:29,377 --> 01:44:31,038
whatever we do...

1213
01:44:31,078 --> 01:44:33,012
we're all rebels

1214
01:44:33,047 --> 01:44:35,777
All your men have been...

1215
01:44:35,816 --> 01:44:37,545
dispersed already

1216
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,179
or you would like...

1217
01:44:41,222 --> 01:44:44,419
to see us all get our wrists broken?

1218
01:44:51,465 --> 01:44:53,797
Fight for our homeland

1219
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:01,202
Bring more arrows here

1220
01:45:28,135 --> 01:45:29,693
Kill all those who tried to run

1221
01:45:30,271 --> 01:45:31,898
and all those evade

1222
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:33,702
What's going on, sister?

1223
01:45:33,741 --> 01:45:34,605
Come, quick

1224
01:45:50,257 --> 01:45:51,918
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1225
01:45:51,959 --> 01:45:54,359
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1226
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:56,056
Alright

1227
01:45:56,097 --> 01:45:58,065
I'll be right behind the wall

1228
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:15,211
Run?

1229
01:46:18,419 --> 01:46:20,319
Get the horses out, quick

1230
01:46:21,489 --> 01:46:22,456
Hurry up

1231
01:46:22,923 --> 01:46:25,255
Kill all those who run

1232
01:46:32,533 --> 01:46:33,500
Go

1233
01:46:34,235 --> 01:46:34,894
General

1234
01:46:34,935 --> 01:46:37,062
The archers had
taken down the North Gate

1235
01:46:37,104 --> 01:46:40,130
around 800 of them had escaped

1236
01:46:42,276 --> 01:46:44,267
Abandon the North Gate

1237
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:47,179
get all soldiers to the Bulwark

1238
01:46:47,214 --> 01:46:48,408
await for my command

1239
01:46:48,449 --> 01:46:49,416
Yes

1240
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:08,528
General

1241
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:10,298
it's over

1242
01:47:10,337 --> 01:47:11,895
we should...

1243
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:13,099
surrender

1244
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:14,368
We can't surrender...

1245
01:47:14,408 --> 01:47:16,239
General, Ge Li said

1246
01:47:16,277 --> 01:47:18,768
if we surrender, we will end up even worst

1247
01:47:18,813 --> 01:47:21,008
General, Ge Li said that...

1248
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:25,849
Stop talking about Ge Li,
there're only us now

1249
01:47:25,886 --> 01:47:27,478
General...

1250
01:47:30,558 --> 01:47:31,820
Any arrows left?

1251
01:47:32,293 --> 01:47:34,022
Listen

1252
01:47:34,995 --> 01:47:37,327
We can't rely on others

1253
01:47:37,364 --> 01:47:38,888
We have to hang on even if we have

1254
01:47:38,933 --> 01:47:40,457
only one soldier left

1255
01:47:44,438 --> 01:47:46,736
General...

1256
01:47:46,774 --> 01:47:49,038
the enemies are here. Leave now

1257
01:47:49,076 --> 01:47:50,634
Everybody, run now

1258
01:47:56,016 --> 01:47:57,074
Let's go

1259
01:48:11,665 --> 01:48:13,098
General...

1260
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:14,532
run...

1261
01:48:18,772 --> 01:48:20,831
This person is the great General Niu

1262
01:49:25,339 --> 01:49:26,306
Commander

1263
01:49:26,340 --> 01:49:29,798
defending the city is Ge Li's intention

1264
01:49:30,477 --> 01:49:32,104
Commander

1265
01:49:32,146 --> 01:49:36,913
we're suppose to hand him over to you...

1266
01:49:36,951 --> 01:49:39,818
but he had escaped

1267
01:49:54,568 --> 01:49:56,593
Ge Li...

1268
01:49:57,004 --> 01:49:59,336
Ge Li...

1269
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:02,005
by tomorrow's noon time

1270
01:50:02,042 --> 01:50:04,533
if you don't come back...

1271
01:50:04,578 --> 01:50:06,603
we'll burn down the City

1272
01:50:06,647 --> 01:50:09,775
and its entire people

1273
01:50:14,888 --> 01:50:16,822
Please lead us to fight back

1274
01:50:16,857 --> 01:50:18,916
I am willing to give up my life

1275
01:50:18,959 --> 01:50:21,120
So do we

1276
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:23,152
If we go back, more people will die

1277
01:50:29,703 --> 01:50:32,297
Why can't we end this war...

1278
01:50:32,339 --> 01:50:35,433
in a rational way?

1279
01:50:35,943 --> 01:50:37,934
You really want to go back?

1280
01:50:38,779 --> 01:50:39,973
...is it worth it?

1281
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:44,642
If this can really stop the war

1282
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,911
and save more lives

1283
01:50:49,556 --> 01:50:50,887
why not?

1284
01:50:52,059 --> 01:50:53,117
...is it worth it?

1285
01:50:57,131 --> 01:50:59,793
Bring all the men out,
leave the women here

1286
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:01,357
Go, quick

1287
01:51:02,503 --> 01:51:04,266
Keep moving, hurry up

1288
01:51:12,913 --> 01:51:16,178
Commander, I think Ge Li will not come

1289
01:51:22,823 --> 01:51:26,953
We'd taken Liang already,
why don't we go back?

1290
01:51:26,994 --> 01:51:29,019
We can reach our main force

1291
01:51:29,063 --> 01:51:31,930
and return Handan

1292
01:51:31,965 --> 01:51:33,933
and protect our homeland

1293
01:51:34,935 --> 01:51:36,926
Isn't that just another battle field?

1294
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:40,098
There's only victory & defeat

1295
01:51:41,508 --> 01:51:43,874
we have taken Liang

1296
01:51:43,911 --> 01:51:46,175
but it's not a victory

1297
01:51:46,213 --> 01:51:48,545
Ge Li had lost

1298
01:51:48,582 --> 01:51:53,281
His theory is impractical,
idealism leads to jealousy

1299
01:51:54,321 --> 01:51:56,448
He can't even gain the trust

1300
01:51:56,490 --> 01:51:58,754
of those he helped

1301
01:51:58,792 --> 01:52:01,056
He was totally beaten

1302
01:52:02,296 --> 01:52:05,424
There is no winner in this battle

1303
01:52:05,466 --> 01:52:09,197
I know Ge Li had lost

1304
01:52:09,236 --> 01:52:10,999
but...

1305
01:52:11,038 --> 01:52:13,768
I had to defeat him myself

1306
01:52:39,666 --> 01:52:41,691
Someone is coming

1307
01:52:41,735 --> 01:52:44,169
Mr Ge Li?

1308
01:52:53,747 --> 01:52:54,679
Close the Gate

1309
01:53:06,727 --> 01:53:08,319
Commander

1310
01:53:08,362 --> 01:53:09,454
on the battlefield

1311
01:53:10,397 --> 01:53:11,591
we had a fair fight

1312
01:53:12,366 --> 01:53:13,731
and no regrets

1313
01:53:14,501 --> 01:53:16,059
You've taken Liang already

1314
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:19,605
why do you have to kill all its people?

1315
01:53:21,475 --> 01:53:22,499
Nonsense

1316
01:53:24,978 --> 01:53:27,742
You think war is a game?

1317
01:53:28,782 --> 01:53:31,148
They fought for you

1318
01:53:31,185 --> 01:53:32,550
you failed

1319
01:53:32,586 --> 01:53:34,554
and with no responsibility

1320
01:53:34,588 --> 01:53:36,249
you left

1321
01:53:37,624 --> 01:53:40,024
It's you...

1322
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:42,858
you bring them to the battlefield

1323
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,094
Fine

1324
01:53:48,135 --> 01:53:50,160
It's totally between you and me

1325
01:53:52,206 --> 01:53:55,733
Will Commander end
all this with me alone

1326
01:53:55,776 --> 01:53:58,836
on the gate tower?

1327
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,409
No matter who wins

1328
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:07,450
please spare these people's life

1329
01:54:08,222 --> 01:54:10,918
It is all between me and Ge Li

1330
01:54:10,958 --> 01:54:13,756
Only one of us can
walk out from the Gate Tower

1331
01:54:13,794 --> 01:54:16,695
No matter who he is

1332
01:54:16,730 --> 01:54:18,755
everything will end

1333
01:54:27,107 --> 01:54:29,473
What are you waiting for?

1334
01:54:29,509 --> 01:54:30,669
Let's start

1335
01:54:30,711 --> 01:54:31,939
Forget it

1336
01:54:33,547 --> 01:54:36,107
As you had said

1337
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:38,049
no matter who get out of here

1338
01:54:38,085 --> 01:54:40,212
this whole thing will be over

1339
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:43,949
Go now, Ge Li is willing to stay here

1340
01:54:44,691 --> 01:54:46,056
Good strategy

1341
01:54:46,893 --> 01:54:48,451
I promised to retreat

1342
01:54:49,396 --> 01:54:51,387
just because I want to defeat you

1343
01:54:51,965 --> 01:54:54,433
but now, you give up

1344
01:54:54,468 --> 01:54:57,596
I am leading 100,000 soldiers

1345
01:54:57,638 --> 01:55:01,096
but before attacking Yan,
I'd already lost 5,000 men

1346
01:55:01,141 --> 01:55:03,871
and afterall, I didn't get Liang

1347
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:05,969
but at least...

1348
01:55:06,013 --> 01:55:07,742
now...

1349
01:55:07,781 --> 01:55:09,681
I can kill you

1350
01:55:09,716 --> 01:55:11,581
and take revenge for my men

1351
01:55:15,022 --> 01:55:19,425
Don't use the dead ones as an excuse

1352
01:55:20,661 --> 01:55:22,720
to cover up your savageness

1353
01:55:24,464 --> 01:55:25,556
War...

1354
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:30,261
will only cause more death

1355
01:55:31,338 --> 01:55:35,297
Both the dead and
the living ones have to suffer...

1356
01:55:35,342 --> 01:55:36,604
Enough

1357
01:55:39,179 --> 01:55:41,545
In battlefields

1358
01:55:41,581 --> 01:55:44,345
survivors are the winners

1359
01:55:49,356 --> 01:55:51,119
Survivors are winners?

1360
01:55:53,794 --> 01:55:55,159
Though you survive

1361
01:55:57,264 --> 01:56:00,233
can your 5,000 soldiers come back?

1362
01:56:04,671 --> 01:56:05,933
Retreat

1363
01:56:10,143 --> 01:56:12,270
end this war now

1364
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,507
or else...

1365
01:56:17,117 --> 01:56:19,517
the rest of your men

1366
01:56:19,553 --> 01:56:21,521
will also lose their lives

1367
01:56:55,288 --> 01:56:57,051
My auxiliary troop has arrived

1368
01:57:38,298 --> 01:57:39,925
General Wei, we're besieged

1369
01:57:39,966 --> 01:57:40,625
Warrirors

1370
01:57:41,668 --> 01:57:43,761
Fight

1371
01:57:50,377 --> 01:57:53,676
Everybody fight and drive the Zhaos out

1372
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:07,951
That way

1373
01:58:19,506 --> 01:58:20,734
Ask yourself

1374
01:58:22,943 --> 01:58:24,740
Is it for the soldiers

1375
01:58:24,778 --> 01:58:26,939
or for your own savageness?

1376
01:58:29,049 --> 01:58:30,380
Please leave

1377
01:58:32,018 --> 01:58:35,818
don't let any more people lose their lives...

1378
01:58:42,529 --> 01:58:43,860
Go now

1379
01:58:44,865 --> 01:58:46,662
I was defeated

1380
01:58:46,700 --> 01:58:50,227
I'm staying here

1381
01:58:51,037 --> 01:58:52,698
Please go

1382
01:58:53,607 --> 01:58:54,631
Commander...

1383
01:58:56,343 --> 01:58:58,504
Survivors are the winners

1384
01:59:07,153 --> 01:59:08,484
Commander

1385
01:59:09,389 --> 01:59:11,448
is victory

1386
01:59:11,491 --> 01:59:13,356
more important than your life?

1387
01:59:17,397 --> 01:59:20,764
My life must be meaningful

1388
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:24,626
Please go

1389
01:59:24,671 --> 01:59:26,662
and tell my people to leave

1390
01:59:26,706 --> 01:59:28,367
I can't help you

1391
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:32,471
You bring them here

1392
01:59:32,512 --> 01:59:34,537
you should save them

1393
01:59:36,249 --> 01:59:38,114
There is someone I have to save

1394
01:59:51,731 --> 01:59:53,164
Yi Yue...

1395
01:59:54,301 --> 01:59:55,859
Yi Yue...

1396
02:00:03,209 --> 02:00:04,506
Shoot

1397
02:00:06,580 --> 02:00:08,013
Don't run

1398
02:00:08,048 --> 02:00:09,447
Attack

1399
02:00:21,127 --> 02:00:22,685
Yi Yue...

1400
02:01:28,795 --> 02:01:34,597
Can you hear me? Are you there?

1401
02:01:45,545 --> 02:01:50,448
Yi Yue! Where are you?

1402
02:01:52,452 --> 02:01:54,147
Yi Yue...

1403
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:58,949
Commander, we must leave now

1404
02:02:00,026 --> 02:02:03,689
You all leave now.
General Wei will lead you home

1405
02:02:03,730 --> 02:02:04,788
Commander...

1406
02:02:04,831 --> 02:02:06,765
This is my command

1407
02:02:06,800 --> 02:02:09,701
I want you all to leave

1408
02:02:11,004 --> 02:02:13,768
Back to you homeland

1409
02:02:15,208 --> 02:02:16,436
Yes

1410
02:02:23,983 --> 02:02:25,177
Listen

1411
02:02:25,852 --> 02:02:27,251
Aim at their feet

1412
02:02:27,287 --> 02:02:28,413
Ready

1413
02:02:29,656 --> 02:02:30,816
Shoot

1414
02:02:46,139 --> 02:02:49,108
General Wei, the Commander ordered you

1415
02:02:49,142 --> 02:02:50,939
to lead our retreat

1416
02:02:52,078 --> 02:02:53,602
Retreat

1417
02:02:55,014 --> 02:02:56,413
Leave now

1418
02:02:57,450 --> 02:03:00,783
I'll stay with the Commander

1419
02:03:00,820 --> 02:03:02,515
The commander ordered you

1420
02:03:02,555 --> 02:03:04,614
to lead our retreat

1421
02:03:04,657 --> 02:03:06,386
We came together, we'll leave together

1422
02:03:06,426 --> 02:03:08,485
Right! We came together
and leave together

1423
02:03:08,528 --> 02:03:10,086
Yes, we'll leave together

1424
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:12,463
I'm not leaving

1425
02:03:12,499 --> 02:03:13,659
Go now

1426
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:15,930
Take the General

1427
02:03:15,969 --> 02:03:17,027
Let me down

1428
02:03:17,904 --> 02:03:19,371
I'm not leaving

1429
02:03:19,405 --> 02:03:22,238
Let me down, that's my order...

1430
02:03:23,376 --> 02:03:24,775
Let me down

1431
02:03:25,812 --> 02:03:28,042
I order you to let me down...

1432
02:06:07,073 --> 02:06:08,062
Shoot

1433
02:06:08,107 --> 02:06:09,267
Yes

1434
02:06:10,243 --> 02:06:11,403
Archers

1435
02:06:12,412 --> 02:06:13,276
Get ready

1436
02:06:14,447 --> 02:06:15,436
Shoot

1437
02:06:36,069 --> 02:06:37,331
Long live My Lord

1438
02:06:39,238 --> 02:06:41,103
Long live My Lord

1439
02:07:18,111 --> 02:07:19,772
Where's General?

1440
02:07:55,114 --> 02:07:56,741
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1441
02:07:56,783 --> 02:07:59,047
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1442
02:08:01,020 --> 02:08:02,954
I'll be right behind the wall

Temptation Of An Angel

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,700
Episode 19

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,720
Jae Hee, don't. Don't move there.

4
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,510
Ahjussi.

5
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,370
Don't, Kyeong Ran.

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,410
Don't.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:33,480
I promised Mom I'd take care of you.

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:58,460
No. No. Impossible. Impossible.

9
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,365
Jae Hee.

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,390
No, Kyeong Ran.

11
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,180
Jae Hee. Jae Hee.

12
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,870
Ahjussi, Joo Ah Ran isn't my sister, right?

13
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,710
Don't talk anymore, we'll talk later.

14
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,790
Hello? This is the Log House.

15
00:01:34,825 --> 00:01:36,342
We have an emergency patient.

16
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:37,860
Hurry and come here. Hurry.

17
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,100
Cruel, evil.

18
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,590
You still have to hurt Jae Hee?

19
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,380
<i>The things that you've done to me,</i>

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,180
plus the things you did to Jae Hee today,

21
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,370
I won't forgive you.

22
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,395
<i>Ahjussi.</i>

23
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,990
<i>Joo Ah Ran isn't my sister, right?</i>

24
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,320
Dad, Mom.

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,930
Kyeong Ran can't be like this.

26
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,730
I'm afraid to be left alone.

27
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,410
Please.

28
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,585
I will give it my best.

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,130
But looking at the crimes,
we can only discuss with your brother.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,980
Because the other person from
the traffic incident already died.

31
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:48,965
{\a6}Episode 19

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,710
There's setting fire, jail, and
improper use of public funding.

33
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,290
There's no way to escape.

34
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Then an incident 25 years ago
can't achieve punishment by law?

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,640
A case that as passed the
appeal date can't be penalized,

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,640
so there's no need to investigate.

37
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,430
Then if it's using someone else's
name to establish a company,

38
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,350
and signing a fake contract,
would these actions be punished?

39
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,520
Then of course we can punish him with
the crimes of forgery and fraud.

40
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,360
<i>Right.</i>

41
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,920
<i>I need to find the mask of Ahn Jae Sung
that Hyun Woo Hyung used.</i>

42
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,160
<i>There has to be a real Ahn Jae Sung
living out there.</i>

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,790
Ahjussi.

44
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,145
What happened?

45
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,710
You woke up? Are you okay?

46
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,140
When you fell, you suffered an impact and
you were temporarily in a coma.

47
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:03,850
You rib was scratched, don't move.

48
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,390
Luckily your head and other
places are normal.

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,210
Where's Joo Ah Ran?

50
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,950
We didn't come together.

51
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,270
Joo Ah Ran is really my sister?

52
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,310
Can't be.

53
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,970
How can that type of person be my sister?

54
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,370
A person who has lies all over her body.

55
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,630
She gave us such hard times.

56
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,770
How can such a scary person be my sister?

57
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,310
Doctor Nam and Joo Ah Ran
made this with this for sure.

58
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,170
It has to be. They wanted to escape
being investigated by the police.

59
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:53,330
So she pretends to be my sister.

60
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,330
If she's really my sister,

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,930
she wouldn't tell people to
lock me up in that place.

62
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,480
Right.

63
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,380
She hasn't paid for the crimes she's done,

64
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,380
and yet she still harms you.

65
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,160
Don't think about Joo Ah Ran anymore.

66
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,720
Just take care of your own health.

67
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,430
I have to tell the nurse that you woke up.

68
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,430
Then.

69
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,150
What about us?

70
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,800
If Joo Ah Ran is really my sister.

71
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,130
Ahjussi and I are impossible.

72
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,625
That won't happen.

73
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,700
No matter what happens,
I'll watch over you.

74
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,890
I won't let you cry, don't worry.

75
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,110
Why did you come here?

76
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,430
Did you come to see how
much harm there was?

77
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,620
Jae Sung, go out.

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,210
The two of us have to talk.

79
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,810
What do you want to do to Jae Hee again?

80
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,460
Leave this room immediately.

81
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,200
I will never trust a woman like you again.

82
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,940
Ahjussi, I'm okay.

83
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,800
There's nothing scary anymore.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,640
You go out first.

85
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,190
How's the wound?

86
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,550
Are you okay?

87
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,900
Aren't you ashamed of those words?

88
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:29,160
You... are really Kyeong Ran?

89
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,700
Time really doesn't have mercy on people.

90
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,190
You and the face that I
imagined are not the same.

91
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,700
Me too.

92
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,550
The sister that I dreamed about,

93
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,730
isn't the way you are now.

94
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,760
In order to reach your own goal,
you can kill people.

95
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,310
A scary woman is my sister.

96
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,310
I feel ashamed.

97
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,270
If I can escape, I really want to.

98
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,990
There is something that you don't know.

99
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,900
Shin Hyun Woo's dad is the
one who killed our parents.

100
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,770
Our innocent parents were crushed
by the car Shin Woo Sub ruined.

101
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,280
I witnessed it 25 years ago.

102
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,640
That family to us, is our enemy.

103
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,340
What?

104
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Shin Hyun Woo and I getting married,

105
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:41,400
pushing Shin Hyun Woo to death,

106
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,180
was to get revenge for our parents.

107
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,440
I won't believe Joo Ah Ran's words.

108
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,515
What you said about 25 years ago,

109
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,440
do you have confirmed evidence?

110
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,140
<i>I've never heard Ahjussi say this.</i>

111
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,910
I only believe in the words my lover says.

112
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,170
The words you say now,

113
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,790
I think they are only
excuses to escape crime.

114
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,370
Because of one man.

115
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,100
Your parents' hatred,

116
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,935
Your sister's sorrowful live,

117
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,170
You're going to ignore it?

118
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,280
<i>How can you blame me?</i>

119
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:22,980
When I take revenge by myself and bleed,

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,660
Do you know how lonely and tiring it was?

121
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:26,360
Don't find any more excuses.

122
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,340
How you're living is just your own choice.

123
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,710
Even if you don't have parents,
not everyone has to take this crooked road,

124
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,660
and live thinking about evil ideas.

125
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,710
Even though I had hard times
and grew up in an orphanage,

126
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:41,160
at least I know that I shouldn't
play with people's lives.

127
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,160
<i>Don't blame one's self,</i>

128
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,210
and corrupt my parent's reputation.

129
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,250
Why won't you hit?

130
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,690
Saying such upright words,

131
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,690
then hitting me with that hand.

132
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,690
What are you doing now?

133
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,590
You want to hit a sister lying
in the hospital, hurt by you?

134
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,420
Are you still considered a human?

135
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,600
Even a degraded bug would
recognize their own siblings.

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,910
How can you be so cruel?

137
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,005
Leave immediately.

138
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,187
Hurry and leave.

139
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,310
You say I'm cruel?

140
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,230
Then what are you, who knows my little
sister and still wants to marry her?

141
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,490
After stealing my whole heart,

142
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,790
you want to marry my little sister?!
Aren't you more cruel?

143
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,520
When were we a married couple?

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,310
Our marriage was a lie in the first place.

145
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,140
That marriage ceremony
can be said to be invalid.

146
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,570
So?

147
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,790
So two people have to marry?

148
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,120
Starting from this moment,
I have no sister.

149
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,560
We've lived separately for 25 years,
I just need to pretend she's dead.

150
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,590
You are no longer my little sister.

151
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,590
You're just Yoon Jae Hee.

152
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,700
Right.

153
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,210
If I'm your little sister.

154
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,645
I'd rather die than return
to Joo Kyeong Ran.

155
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,930
I want to live as Yoon Jae Hee
for my whole life.

156
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,420
<i>Rather than having a fake sister,</i>

157
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,950
Why don't I live uprightly as an orphan?

158
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:51,150
How I thought I would reunite
with my sister wasn't like this.

159
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,720
I've anticipated it for so long.

160
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,620
I've waited so anxiously.

161
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:10,330
I never thought that reuniting
would hurt each other like that.

162
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,420
What should I do?

163
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,370
In the room my sister locked me up in,

164
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,950
I actually found out that
that person was my sister.

165
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,640
Joo Ah Ran, get your mind straight.

166
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,590
Looking like a fool, why are you crying?

167
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,980
Your little sister already died.

168
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,780
My parents and her all
died being crushed by wood.

169
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,830
I don't need a brat like Yoon Jae Hee.

170
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,150
President, I have something to say.

171
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,150
Don't say it.

172
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,170
What crime do you commit when marrying?

173
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,170
Why won't you let people talk?

174
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,560
What other explosive news
do you have to say?

175
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,940
Perhaps, you have a child?

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,845
Or did you remarry and
get a new husband?

177
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,690
How many more secrets
do I not know about?

178
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,999
Tell me truthfully.

179
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,980
Right.

180
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,500
I have a lot of secrets I didn't tell President.

181
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,920
My husband left a
debt of over $10 million.

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,770
Last year he was bit by a
dog and used $2,300,000.

183
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,515
It really feels like it's getting worst.

184
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,750
I also need to pay my
little brother's tuition fee.

185
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,145
His brain is also stupid.

186
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,160
He's still in 35th place after
studying 3 days and 3 nights.

187
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,455
Yeon Jae.

188
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,490
But I also have a lot of good points.

189
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,800
Not only do I eat a lot,
I'm also really good at cooking.

190
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,800
I really know how to cook and
I can hammer needles.

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,875
Also,

192
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,330
When I was in school,
I was the class representative.

193
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,855
I have a lot of hair,

194
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,340
so the children don't need to
worry about having a little hair.

195
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,230
And.

196
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,960
What are you doing?

197
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,530
Enough.
Those are enough to qualify as my wife.

198
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,530
Don't think you're the best again.

199
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,720
Who's thinking that they're the best?

200
00:15:01,755 --> 00:15:03,720
So what if you've married once.

201
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,850
You need to know that compared
to the fake Joo Ah Ran,

202
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,360
do you know how beautiful
the truthful Yeon Jae is?

203
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,730
My parents also like you a lot, Yeon Jae.

204
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,435
Where do you need to go?

205
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,095
You want to escape from me?

206
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,205
Let me go. I'm begging you to let me go.

207
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,190
No matter how much I deny it,
I'm still Joo Ah Ran's little sister.

208
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,455
How can I love Ahjussi like that?

209
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,450
Nothing has changed between us.

210
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,890
I only love you as my woman,
and you also love me.

211
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,580
It doesn't matter who's woman
and who's sister you are.

212
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,300
Our heart didn't change.
What reason is there for us to separate.

213
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:13,450
Ahjussi.

214
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,500
Don't leave.

215
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,500
Be by my side.

216
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,310
If you leave, I really won't have confidence.

217
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:24,540
You will regret it later.

218
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:28,380
This might be our last chance to separate.

219
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,300
No matter who makes you sway,

220
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,570
We have to endure and persist until the end.

221
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:40,470
The road that you have to walk
later will be even more harsh.

222
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:43,740
But I will never give up.

223
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,410
You also have to believe me.

224
00:16:46,445 --> 00:16:48,480
You can never let go of my hand.

225
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,490
What are you doing now?

226
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,490
Setting your mind straight to
deal with them is not enough.

227
00:17:40,525 --> 00:17:42,490
You can still drink this down?

228
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,590
Today I need to drink.

229
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:04,480
Kyeong Ran is like a swollen
piece inside my heart.

230
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,750
I want to use a knife to chop it off clean,

231
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,670
and forget about it.

232
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:15,850
So today I have to get drunk.

233
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,830
You know where Nurse Yoon is?

234
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,550
You found her?

235
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,550
At the hospital.

236
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,450
She tried to escape from the room
I locked her up in, and got injured.

237
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,880
What?

238
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,200
You locked up Nurse Yoon?

239
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,750
It's really an interesting fate.

240
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,700
An older sister locking up
her little sister, hating her.

241
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,590
A little sister who doesn't recognize
her older sister, blaming her.

242
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,730
We're no longer sisters.

243
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,450
Joo Kyeong Ran already died.

244
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,620
Only Shin Hyun Woo's woman,
Yoon Jae Hee, is left over.

245
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,170
Stop saying what you don't mean.

246
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,960
How much you miss your little sister,

247
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,960
I know clearer than you.

248
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,820
Why are you saying these
words to hurt your own heart?

249
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,820
I won't.

250
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,240
The more I miss,
the stronger the feeling of betrayal is.

251
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,240
I won't let go of Shin Hyun Woo
and Yoon Jae Hee.

252
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,390
I need to ruin my enemy and his
wife with my own hands.

253
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,910
You have to change the situation like this?

254
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,400
You have to make a sister that she
hasn't seen in 25 years her enemy.

255
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,150
And only then your heart's
hatred will be solved?

256
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:00,150
Stop provoking unwanted trouble.

257
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,510
Joo Ah Ran losing the qualification of
being a sister isn't because of me.

258
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,950
It's not too late now.

259
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,105
Let the little sister return to Ah Ran's side.

260
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,220
This is the last choice Hyung can
do for the two people that he loved.

261
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:14,500
Don't think that you can use Jae Hee
as a shield to beg for forgiveness.

262
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,680
<i>Joo Ah Ran is Joo Ah Ran.
Yoon Jae Hee is Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

263
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,780
I don't care how much I love Jae Hee,

264
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,420
I won't forgive the woman
who ruined me and my family.

265
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,980
This is what humiliated my life.

266
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,980
Even if Yoon Jae Hee becomes unfortunate.

267
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,700
Even if she becomes unfortunate.

268
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,530
Nam Joo Seung.
Don't think that your love is that that great.

269
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,855
You're not loving Joo Ah Ran,

270
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,310
you're ruining that woman's whole life.

271
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,280
Why don't you know that because of you,
her sins are getting deeper and deeper.

272
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,690
The one making Joo Ah Ran's sins
heavier isn't me, it's you, Hyung.

273
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,490
If you didn't pretend to be a dead person.

274
00:20:57,525 --> 00:21:01,430
Ah Ran wouldn't have set fire, right?

275
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,490
Today it looks like you are really pitiful.

276
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,760
Secretary Nam took pride in you.

277
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:18,280
Luckily he never saw you like this.

278
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,360
Don't casually talk about my father.

279
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,100
In the world, no matter who,
they just need to insult my dad,

280
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,790
and I will kill them all.

281
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,550
President, Madam, and Hyung, you.

282
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,550
You pitiful brat.

283
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,320
<i>[Fax: Ahn Jae Sung's Profile]</i>

284
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,910
You found the real Ahn Jae Sung?

285
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,465
He's in England now.

286
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,615
He was originally from Angel Orphanage.

287
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:50,290
Looks like it's the Ahn Jae Sung
that Yoon Jae Hee introduced.

288
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,635
What are we going to do when we get him?

289
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,800
We have to charge
Shin Hyun Woo with fraud.

290
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,930
He stole someone's identity
to build a company,

291
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,450
and he took away Soul that you had
and its orders and real estates.

292
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,590
The contract only needs to have
Ahn Jae Sung written on it.

293
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,560
Then the contracts that
Shin Hyun Woo signed were all frauds.

294
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,020
If that's the case, then he must have also
lied about purchasing Jang Heung Pension.

295
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:21,160
Shin Hyun Woo can't have bought that
community with hundreds of millions of dollars.

296
00:23:21,195 --> 00:23:24,380
We just need to confirm that
the real Ahn Jae Sung is in England,

297
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,990
then searching up what
Shin Hyun Woo did isn't too hard.

298
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,770
We're already being charged,
we can't sit and wait for death.

299
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,780
Hello? I'm Joo Ah Ran.

300
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,780
What?

301
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,780
Promissory note return?

302
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,520
Then do it like that.

303
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,110
If it is due, of course I have to return it.

304
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,240
What does that mean?

305
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,400
Promissory note.

306
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,215
Because the company is in trouble,

307
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,660
The promissory note that Soul passed
out needs to be returned.

308
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,140
Not married yet and turning everything over,

309
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,845
my heart didn't feel comfortable.

310
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,240
So I never signed my name
on the promissory note.

311
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,880
I can't believe that I'm being helped.

312
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,590
Now, when Shin Woo Sub thinks that
he's won the game and is celebrating,

313
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,590
I really need to hit him on
the back of his head.

314
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,800
How much is on the promissory note?

315
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,520
Considering Soul's condition now,
it's hard for it not to close down.

316
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,800
Dad's company closing down.

317
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,770
Son being searched for fraud.

318
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,800
I really need to live life to know.

319
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,290
I heard the person you love is sick.
Why did you still come here?

320
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,210
I said you didn't need to send me.
I won't feel depressed.

321
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:01,210
I wanted to come myself.

322
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,670
Also, this is a present.

323
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,600
I used Chang Mo's design to make these.

324
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,710
It's really too pretty.

325
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,210
Thank you.

326
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,430
I will treasure these forever.

327
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,430
It's like seeing President Ahn.

328
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,660
Right.

329
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,470
This is for the Jang Heung
Pension that I own.

330
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,750
I might never return to Seoul.

331
00:25:36,891 --> 00:25:39,510
So I'll let President Ahn run it.

332
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,370
Even though I'm really thankful,
I don't want it.

333
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,680
Now, I want to use my own
abilities to make Soul stronger.

334
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:52,280
Until now, you've helped me with these,

335
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,650
To outside people, it's already enough.

336
00:25:55,810 --> 00:26:00,710
To President Ahn, I'm only an outsider?

337
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,700
Why are you using such
depressing eyes to look at me?

338
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,700
What I mean is,

339
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,230
I treated you as a comrade whom
I shared pain and revenge with.

340
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,100
I believe in President Ahn's abilities.

341
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,260
If you have any difficulties,
feel free to contact me.

342
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,420
We shall shake hands and bid farewell here.

343
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:48,390
How's your health?

344
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,955
I'm okay.

345
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,890
Making you worry, I'm sorry.

346
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,970
You already know that
Ah Ran is your real sister?

347
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,970
Even though it's hard to believe.

348
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,540
the two of you really are sisters.

349
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,300
Because the factory President
died in my husband's factory.

350
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:07,780
I always felt sorry.

351
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,570
So I raised the factory
President's two daughters.

352
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,725
Madam.

353
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,610
No matter what,
it's your sister's failed marriage.

354
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,140
Can you can still marry and live with a man
who was once your sister's husband?

355
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,270
No matter if it's by law, or by morals,
it just won't work.

356
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,710
I can't repeat this and let
everyone become unfortunate again.

357
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:34,710
I'm begging you.

358
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,710
Nurse Yoon, you, let go of our Hyun Woo.

359
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,565
If Nurse Yoon can't decide,

360
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,600
Hyun Woo won't let go of you, Nurse Yoon.

361
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:43,415
Not because of love,

362
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,620
Even if it's because he feels sorry,
he won't let go of Nurse Yoon.

363
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,500
Madam, I love Hyun Woo.

364
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:54,882
To me, who is an orphan.

365
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:58,310
Ahjussi is my whole dream.

366
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,610
Because of Ahjussi,
I was able to go to college.

367
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:03,770
Because of Ahjussi,
I worked hard and lived to be nice.

368
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,225
I'll do well.

369
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,780
I have confidence that I'll
be a good wife to Ahjussi,

370
00:28:07,815 --> 00:28:11,130
and be a good daughter-in-law
to his parents.

371
00:28:11,165 --> 00:28:13,130
Why are you so selfish?

372
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,945
If you're like this, Nurse Yoon,

373
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,560
do you know how tired
our Hyun Woo will get?

374
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,560
<i>My son,</i>

375
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,560
No matter what happens.

376
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,560
I won't allow him to marry two sisters.

377
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,780
Even if it's one time,

378
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,770
Can't I just think of my own happiness?

379
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,160
I don't want to lose Ahjussi.

380
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,710
Even if I throw away the
name Joo Kyeong Ran,

381
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,840
I still want to marry Ahjussi.

382
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,620
I'm begging you, Madam.

383
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,830
I'll pretend that you understood my words.

384
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:47,245
I'm leaving.

385
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Take care of your health.

386
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:59,430
Think of this as returning
everything that we owe you.

387
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,800
No matter how much you hate Ah Ran,

388
00:29:24,835 --> 00:29:26,290
I trust Nurse Yoon.

389
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,100
Only Nurse Yoon can save Ah Ran.

390
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,870
If Nurse Yoon begs Hyun Woo Hyung.

391
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,750
Maybe the crime will be less.

392
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:40,725
No, I don't want to.

393
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,610
I won't do anything for Joo Ah Ran.

394
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,260
I know what she did to Hyun Woo.

395
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,130
She isn't free of crime just
because we're blood related.

396
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,630
You sister has her reasons for doing so.

397
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,190
She's not doing this because
she wants to live better.

398
00:29:58,225 --> 00:30:00,180
You want to talk about my
parents' wrongful treatment?

399
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,595
No matter what the reason is.

400
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,500
The traffic incident and setting fire
can't be considered normal actions.

401
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,195
The person who did such cruel things,

402
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,230
And still dragging me to
an empty room, is Joo Ah Ran.

403
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:13,850
You might not be able to understand now,

404
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,710
But no matter what,
both of you are related by blood.

405
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,740
Don't wait until Ah Ran turns
more unfortunate to regret it.

406
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,310
Don't wait until it's too late,
help your sister.

407
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,600
I will refuse.

408
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:30,490
If you refuse, I won't let go of Hyun Woo.

409
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,380
I'll use all the plans that I can think of.

410
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,880
and push Hyun Woo to the unfortunate cliff.

411
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,826
Nurse Yoon, choose yourself.

412
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:42,565
You still think you can threaten me now?

413
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,900
Rather than cooperating with
President Nam and Joo Ah Ran,

414
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,600
I'd rather choose to be unfortunate.

415
00:30:49,763 --> 00:30:53,370
Hyun Woo and I, will definitely marry.

416
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:55,370
The date as already been set.

417
00:30:55,920 --> 00:31:00,710
I won't let the two of you control our life.

418
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,300
Lawyer,

419
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,920
Please start the case between
Shin Hyun Woo and I.

420
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,700
What? The promissory note came back?

421
00:31:19,735 --> 00:31:21,200
What does that mean?

422
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,700
When did I issue a promissory note?

423
00:31:23,735 --> 00:31:26,110
It seems to be Joo Ah Ran's doing.

424
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,425
When she was collecting funds,

425
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
it seems like she issued promissory notes.

426
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,510
If you don't return it immediately,
the company will be in danger.

427
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:33,510
Damn.

428
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:35,605
Where can I get that much
money all of a sudden?

429
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,650
I also had to pack my luggage
and got kicked out.

430
00:31:37,685 --> 00:31:39,660
I just returned, brushed off the dust,
and sat here.

431
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,660
Oh, my head.

432
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,340
Why can't there be one
day where I can relax?

433
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,600
Hurry and call Hyun Woo.

434
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,300
Our Jae Hee is so pretty.

435
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,300
Ahjussi is already really handsome.

436
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,960
Yes, Dad.

437
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,340
I'm trying on hanboks with Jae Hee.

438
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,450
There aren't many days remaining
before our marriage,

439
00:32:05,485 --> 00:32:07,570
so I have to prepare everything.

440
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,570
What?

441
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,810
Where did you go?

442
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,240
I went to confirm the promissory
note's condition.

443
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,670
Soul Furniture is already in danger.

444
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,420
Did you start the case with Shin Hyun Woo?

445
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,630
Yeah.

446
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:35,850
I don't think it's fair that my
doctor's license was cancelled.

447
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,780
If Hyun Woo wasn't dead,

448
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,725
Then the fake treatment I did was fake.

449
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
If we're talking about lying,
the patient is the same.

450
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:53,180
Then, me setting fire wasn't
to kill Shin Hyun Woo.

451
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,840
Shin Hyun Woo already made
a fake person and escaped.

452
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,340
Then that wouldn't be considered as murder.

453
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,305
Shin Hyun Woo.

454
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,265
You're jumping into the
trap you dug yourself.

455
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,770
Stealing another person's identity,
acting as a dead person.

456
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:12,510
It's a movie directed by you to seek revenge.

457
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,810
Right.

458
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:22,400
Did you know that Hyun Woo and Nurse Yoon
have set their marriage date set?

459
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,470
Marriage date?

460
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:34,900
<i>Yoon Jae Hee.</i>

461
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,980
Looks like you're busying
preparing for the marriage.

462
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,690
You're not married yet and yet you've
moved into Shin Hyun Woo's house.

463
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,920
Aren't we pretending that
we don't know each other?

464
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,460
Don't look for me ever again.

465
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,320
it's not convenient seeing you.

466
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,690
What are you doing now?

467
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,570
You listen carefully to me.

468
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,365
No matter what happens,

469
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,660
I won't send you to an enemy's house.

470
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,885
I waited 25 years, just to see that face?

471
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm still the same in feeling
despair for my sister.

472
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,545
We lost our parents.

473
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,280
You were crying because of hunger
while I had you on my back.

474
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,480
I was accused of being a thief
because I wanted to feed you.

475
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,230
Even if I had to go through garbage to
find food, I would give you the best.

476
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,230
After I left you.

477
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,380
I looked for you on the
streets like a crazy woman.

478
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:47,220
But in return you're going to
do be like this to me?

479
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,185
The sister that I anticipated,

480
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,620
isn't one who stole other
people's food to feed me.

481
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,135
Even if I starved,

482
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,100
I want a sister who is
honest and upright.

483
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,800
A woman who's heart is filled
with hatred and is so twisted,

484
00:36:03,835 --> 00:36:05,940
is a person that I look down on.

485
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,650
What?

486
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,350
I have to marry Hyun Woo.

487
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:17,285
If you feel sorry towards Hyun Woo,

488
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,320
then sincerely congratulate
Hyun Woo's marriage.

489
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,590
Then redeem your crimes broadly.

490
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:28,700
This is the last warning I can
give as a younger sister.

491
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,875
Up until she transferred
everything to my name,

492
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,500
she never mentioned anything
about a promissory note.

493
00:36:53,535 --> 00:36:55,265
<i>Joo Ah Ran is such a tricky person.</i>

494
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,170
She has nothing, how could she
have given away all of her fortune?

495
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,745
Then what should we do now?

496
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,895
The promissory notes amount is really big.

497
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,230
No.

498
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:06,130
What face does she have to
pull our family into water?

499
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,535
Hyun Woo, what are you doing?

500
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:09,440
I let you give her to the police to arrest her,

501
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,285
What's the reason for you to hesitate?

502
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,530
Is it that Joo Ah Ran
knows one of your weaknesses?

503
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,235
No.

504
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,335
Right now, I'm thinking about how I can
withstand these promissory notes.

505
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,400
First we have to discuss how we can extend
the time of the promissory notes.

506
00:37:22,435 --> 00:37:23,580
If it doesn't work,

507
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,720
We can only use our estate money.

508
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:26,550
Right.

509
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,175
I'll bring out my store and apartment.

510
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,700
No matter what, we can't let it close.

511
00:37:31,735 --> 00:37:33,700
Finding this company wasn't easy.

512
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:35,275
How about asking Julie Jung?

513
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:37,750
That person would definitely help us.

514
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,850
She left today.

515
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,850
This isn't coming along.

516
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,845
The company might have a bloody storm.

517
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,345
First we need to set up Hyun Woo's wedding.

518
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:54,720
<i>Tomorrow, we'll simply eat a dinner
and that will be the engagement.</i>

519
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,290
We don't know what tricks
Joo Ah Ran will use again.

520
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,970
You need to get engaged,
then she'll give up on you.

521
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,310
Okay.

522
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,190
What?

523
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,740
The engagement ceremony is tomorrow?

524
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,740
Honey,

525
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,745
Why are you in such a rush?

526
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,635
Hyun Woo returned not long ago.

527
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,690
You only have to do it,
why do you have so much to say?

528
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:20,690
Hyun Woo's divorce result already came.

529
00:38:20,725 --> 00:38:22,120
Just do it like that.

530
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,345
Ah, money is a really nice thing.

531
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,590
Your face hasn't changed at all
compared to 25 years ago.

532
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:41,920
<i>Aigoo. Your home looks really fancy.</i>

533
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:43,542
<i>You clean it very well.</i>

534
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:45,095
Why did you come here?

535
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,500
Didn't I say not to come to my house?

536
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,195
Now we have to bargain.

537
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,380
If you don't bring over our Kyeong Ran.

538
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:58,245
We're going to stay here.

539
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,365
Looks like you still don't know.

540
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,450
Ah Ran and Kyeong Ran already met.

541
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:03,790
What?

542
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,790
That's what you say.

543
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,330
Aigoo, I knew this would happen.

544
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,400
That's why Ah Ran lost contact with us
and locked the doors for the wedding.

545
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,780
What does this mean?

546
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,830
We made porridge for a dog.

547
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:18,342
Aigoo. I'm going crazy.

548
00:39:18,377 --> 00:39:19,785
<i>That's why I said.</i>

549
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,510
<i>If you had gave in to our Kyeong Ran earlier,</i>

550
00:39:21,545 --> 00:39:24,007
<i>We wouldn't have done useless things.</i>

551
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,470
<i>What's the use of putting a parent here?</i>

552
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:31,500
I have something to ask of you two.

553
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,970
Can you do me a favor?

554
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,690
If you do this favor,

555
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,180
I won't mistreat you.

556
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,375
Engagement?

557
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,350
Joo Ah Ran will continue
blocking our marriage.

558
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,670
We can't always be controlled by her.

559
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,480
I'm also worried that your soft
heart will make you waver,

560
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,480
I won't waver..

561
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,330
I already promised you.

562
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,350
No matter what difficulties there are,
I won't let go of Ahjussi's hand.

563
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,720
Even if my parents were
alive to block my marriage,

564
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,270
I'd still want to marry Ahjussi.

565
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,875
<i>Be strong.</i>

566
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,270
Tomorrow,
everything will return to its original place.

567
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,527
You came back.

568
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:59,575
Where did you go?

569
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,249
I went to meet someone.

570
00:41:01,953 --> 00:41:03,570
Tomorrow,
Hyun Woo's engagement ceremony,

571
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,570
I have to take care of a special guest.

572
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,570
Special guest?

573
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,340
Just wait.

574
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,720
I have to give a meaningful present
at Hyun Woo's ceremony.

575
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,860
Just my family breaking up isn't fair.

576
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:35,720
Your family will also have a storm today.

577
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,315
Aigoo, you're Kyeong Ran.

578
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,330
I told you you can't lie
about blood relationships.

579
00:41:48,365 --> 00:41:52,125
She totally has her father's face.

580
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,145
This is definitely Joo Chul Min's daughter.

581
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,950
Yes, I would recognize you
even if we were in the streets.

582
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,600
Who are you two?

583
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,720
We're Kyeong Ran's uncle and aunt.

584
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:08,720
Who are you?

585
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:12,910
Uncle and aunt?

586
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,880
Where did Jae Hee go?
Why did you come by yourself?

587
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,840
She saw her Uncle's family.

588
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,400
She'll be here soon.

589
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:29,160
She grew up in an orphanage
and still has an uncle?

590
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,400
It's a engagement ceremony,
why don't you invite them.

591
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,400
We'll visit officially.

592
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,580
We were so angry we couldn't even sleep.

593
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,910
How can you marry Ah Ran's ex-husband?

594
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,140
You didn't drop from the sky.

595
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,065
You are our Joo family's child.

596
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,655
How can you marry your brother-in-law?

597
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,175
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed I can't talk.

598
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:23,400
Just pretend that there was
no engagement ceremony.

599
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:24,850
Come with us to get some air.

600
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:27,634
<i>Driver, drive faster.</i>

601
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:31,590
Did Joo Ah Ran tell you
to block my marriage?

602
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:33,790
<i>So you came to find me?</i>

603
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,605
Driver. Please stop.

604
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,125
Don't stop. Keep driving. Keep going.

605
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,610
No one can stop me from my engagement.

606
00:43:43,645 --> 00:43:45,260
I have to get engaged.

607
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,100
Driver. Please drive to Kuang Hwa
Police Department.

608
00:43:48,135 --> 00:43:49,065
Police Department?

609
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,725
Hurry and reject. Go. Go.

610
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,895
My head hurts.
Let's decide at the police department.

611
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,830
Oh my god. This person, do you
want someone to go to jail?

612
00:43:56,865 --> 00:43:59,300
Listen. Stop there.

613
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,360
Stop. Stop.

614
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,190
Kyeong Ran. You come out also.

615
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:11,530
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.

616
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,515
Ahjussi. Hurry and go.

617
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,700
Kyeong Ran. Kyeong Ran. Aigoo.

618
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,450
You brat.

619
00:44:47,903 --> 00:44:51,930
<i>Down here is a toast full of wishes
for the groom and bride.</i>

620
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,190
<i>Please raise your cups.</i>

621
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,210
<i>Everyone together. Cheers.</i>

622
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:12,930
What are you guys doing?

623
00:45:12,964 --> 00:45:15,740
Where do you think this is?

624
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:23,075
You..

625
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,120
Because we're guests you didn't invite,
were you surprised?

626
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,930
Our wedding was also full of
people who we didn't invite.

627
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:32,690
I should thank you for that.

628
00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:35,896
Joo Ah Ran. Nam Joo Seung.
Leave immediately.

629
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:38,655
Aren't you too unreasonable to a guest?

630
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,490
This person is Director Jung who worked for
President since the start of Gam Yu Furniture.

631
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,440
We invited him because he had
something to say to President.

632
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,460
Director Jung,
what do you want to talk about?

633
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,759
Today is an important family reunion.

634
00:45:55,004 --> 00:45:56,870
Let's meet some other day.

635
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,610
Long time no see, President Shin.

636
00:46:01,062 --> 00:46:06,220
Secretary Nam's son and Leader Joo's
daughter have grown up.

637
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,740
It's already been 25 years since the incident.

638
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,705
Director Jung.

639
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:19,920
Director Jung.
Do you know how my father died?

640
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,855
<i>Please say it.</i>

641
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:25,430
What's the real reason
behind the car incident?

642
00:46:25,465 --> 00:46:27,430
Only Director, you, can say it clearly.

643
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,210
That person left really pitifully.

644
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,940
The car suddenly lost
balance and tipped over.

645
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,560
After investigation, one of the
tire's screws was found loose.

646
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:46,830
Who purposely malfunctioned the car?

647
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:52,730
At that time, President Shin meant to not
tell the police and let it quietly calm down.

648
00:46:54,460 --> 00:47:00,280
That right, President Shin and President Joo's
relationships weren't that good.

649
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,485
What are you talking about now?

650
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:09,670
The person who fixed the tired,
was you, Shin Woo Sub.

651
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,840
You were relaxed because
the recourse date was passed.

652
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,390
Even if the law forgives you,

653
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,420
I won't forget this crime even if I die.

654
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,170
Nurse Yoon. You should come to our side.

655
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,310
You still don't know that you and
President's family don't match?

656
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,240
Right. I left out something important.

657
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,920
My father had two daughters.

658
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,520
Coincidentally, both of them are here.

659
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,760
What? Two daughters?

660
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,890
The older one is me.
The younger one is Yoon Jae Hee.

661
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,300
<i>Dad's soon to be daughter-in-law.</i>

662
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,400
What?

663
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:10,740
Yoon Jae Hee.

664
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,115
<i>My younger sister, Joo Kyeong Ran.</i>

665
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,680
<i>Why did she want to use a fake name,
Yoon Jae Hee,</i>

666
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,680
<i>and become this family's daughter-in-law?</i>

667
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,550
You know without me saying right?

668
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,370
It's my parents' hatred that called
both daughters to be in this family.

669
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,920
How can this be?

670
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:58,230
Thank you Joo Seung,
things went smoothly.

671
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,590
I can't believe that there would be
someone to prove that day's incident.

672
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,430
What do you plan on doing now?

673
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,290
I need to put a deadly flaw
onto Shin Woo Sub's morality.

674
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,700
Let him be swallowed by society.

675
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,740
You don't need to be behind
bars to be considered in jail.

676
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,995
You're going to give all the things
President Shin did to the media?

677
00:49:19,996 --> 00:49:22,460
This time I need Kyeong Ran to help out.

678
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:27,680
She needs to do something
for our dead parents.

679
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:33,810
You knew that Yoon Jae Hee is Ah Ran's
sister and you still want to marry?

680
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:35,275
Yes.

681
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:37,275
<i>You crazy bastard.</i>

682
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:39,850
There's no other woman to marry,

683
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,150
So you're going to marry the younger sister
of the person who turned you into this?

684
00:49:43,185 --> 00:49:45,445
<i>Why does it have to
be Joo Chul Min's daughter?</i>

685
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,830
<i>Of all the woman in this world,
is there only Joo Chul Min's daughter?</i>

686
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,800
Honey, calm down.
Your blood pressure might rise.

687
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,800
You also knew.

688
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,475
Why didn't you block it?

689
00:49:56,510 --> 00:49:58,820
Are you still considered a mother?

690
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,395
This marriage cannot be completed.

691
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:03,670
Don't say that it's your life.

692
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,850
Even if we have to scoop
our family up from a flood,

693
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:10,450
I won't accept her as my daughter-in-law.

694
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:13,200
I didn't know from the start.

695
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,510
I found out that they were
sisters after deciding to marry.

696
00:50:17,545 --> 00:50:20,820
But we can't separate like that.

697
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,820
The one time I had to leave Jae Hee,

698
00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:24,290
No matter if I was Ahn Jae Sung
or Shin Hyun Woo,

699
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,345
I was a bastard that couldn't do anything.

700
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,200
Even if you say it a million times,
my answer will be the same.

701
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,885
I can't be a family with that type of family.

702
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,320
Yoon Jae Hee definitely
approached you with a plan.

703
00:50:36,355 --> 00:50:39,310
Dad. A package came with your name.

704
00:50:39,345 --> 00:50:40,870
Open it and look.

705
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,550
What is this?

706
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,240
It's a silk and a letter.

707
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,340
Isn't this Secretary Nam's uncle?

708
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,525
What?

709
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,850
Secretary Nam?

710
00:50:56,963 --> 00:50:58,625
But who is this child?

711
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,790
<i>Who is Mom and Secretary Nam
carrying in this picture?</i>

712
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,790
<i>It looks like a family picture.</i>

713
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,180
Who is playing these kinds of tricks?

714
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,715
Joo Seung that bastard.

715
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,640
He wants to threaten
me with his dead father?

716
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,720
Is that child Joo Seung Hyung?

717
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:31,840
<i>I heard Joo Seung's mother
died a long time ago.</i>

718
00:51:31,933 --> 00:51:34,210
<i>Mom thought he was so
pitiful that you took care of him.</i>

719
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,340
<i>Then what is this silk?</i>

720
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,200
<i>Mom, tell us.</i>

721
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,310
Are you and Secretary Nam related?

722
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,810
<i>The grudge between Shin Hyun Woo's
family and our family is true.</i>

723
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,257
<i>You have to believe it.</i>

724
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,635
<i>You are allowed not to accept me,</i>

725
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,450
<i>But you can't deny that
Shin Woo Sub killed our parents.</i>

726
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,450
<i>Are you listening to me?</i>

727
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,635
Joo Ah Ran is a suspect of setting the fire.

728
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,700
She's also a criminal
who killed her husband.

729
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,560
No. No. No.

730
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,870
What should I do?

731
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:09,790
I'm a sinner towards Sister.
I'm a sinner towards Ahjussi.

732
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:13,350
No matter what choice I make,

733
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:17,680
I won't be happy.

734
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,580
Was it you?

735
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,880
Did you send this picture to my house?

736
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:48,680
Besides my dad,
the only person with that picture is me.

737
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,790
You didn't know?

738
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,460
Madam is my mother.

739
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,270
Shut up.

740
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,280
Then when do I need to die until?

741
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,580
Why does it have to be like this?

742
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,785
Because of President's family happiness.

743
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,490
It doesn't matter if I'm
not a person of this world.

744
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,295
President and Madam are the same.

745
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:12,750
Both of you are selfish people
who only know of their own family.

746
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,545
No matter where you go, disappear.

747
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:20,300
Don't start arguments in my family.

748
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:23,772
Don't appear in front of my eyes ever.

749
00:54:24,082 --> 00:54:26,700
Then let go of Ah Ran.

750
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,510
Persuade Hyun Woo Hyung
to get Ah Ran off the hook.

751
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,350
Then both of us will leave.

752
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:37,410
Are you threatening me now?

753
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:39,410
I'm not threatening, I'm discussing.

754
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:45,190
The more you abandon Ah Ran,
the more publicized your secrets will be.

755
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:50,210
Does the war that injures
both sides need to continue?

756
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:53,290
I really raised a tiger.

757
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:56,670
In this world,
no matter how weak the animal is,

758
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,420
As long as it wasn't abandoned by
it's mother, it will become strong.

759
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,250
What do you have to say?

760
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:28,500
When did you start knowing,

761
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:31,790
that your mother was my mother.

762
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,380
It was when Dad passed away.

763
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,615
But don't worry.

764
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:42,330
I never wished to be
treated as your brother.

765
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,690
Then why did you send
that letter and picture?

766
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,840
What do you want?

767
00:55:49,875 --> 00:55:51,370
What I want?

768
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,510
Of course it's Madam's family
becoming unfortunate.

769
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,280
It's too lonely wanting only one
person to become unfortunate.

770
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,780
You bastard.

771
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:09,770
A family arguing is pretty exciting.

772
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,700
You should accept it also.

773
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:23,941
Is it to take revenge on the
mother who abandoned you,

774
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:26,860
that you helped Joo Ah Ran
go against my family?

775
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,176
This is how you thank the
mother who gave birth to you?

776
00:56:31,938 --> 00:56:34,850
This is how you thank me, who loved and
took care of you and became your brother-

777
00:56:34,885 --> 00:56:36,850
What do you know?

778
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:39,810
What would you, who grew up
in a honey jar, know?

779
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,230
When I was sick,
I never once called mother.

780
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:44,520
With a life like a beggar.

781
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,360
For the past 30 years,
Madam was never my mother.

782
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,560
She's only a President's wife
who is so cold and scary.

783
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,200
So you want to kill me?

784
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,220
You want to kill me,
me, who hogged your mother's love.

785
00:56:58,255 --> 00:57:01,680
Is your goal to let your
mom become miserable?

786
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:09,360
When no one was there,
if she put food in my bowl,

787
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,590
I wouldn't hate her so much.

788
00:57:11,625 --> 00:57:13,590
<i>Behind me,</i>

789
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,220
If she spoke to me nicely,

790
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,380
Then maybe I would understand everything.

791
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:22,480
But she totally forgot about this son.

792
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,200
This is more cruel than getting abandoned.

793
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,480
Will you become happy
after your mother's hurt?

794
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:34,540
<i>If you're still considered Mom's son,</i>

795
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,830
Letting Mother become unfortunate,
you won't get freedom.

796
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,600
How could that be?

797
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:47,620
My revenge hasn't ended yet.

798
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:50,550
There will soon be a lawsuit
letter sent to your house.

799
00:57:50,585 --> 00:57:52,300
The real Ahn Jae Sung might also come.

800
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,300
You should get ready.

801
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:59,700
No, maybe he's already at the airport.

802
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,330
The real Ahn Jae Sung?

803
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,790
<i>[Killing Devil: Shin Woo Sub]</i>

804
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:40,440
Who did this?

805
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:43,750
What were you doing looking
at these getting taped up?

806
00:58:43,785 --> 00:58:45,591
Hurry and rip them off.

807
00:58:45,592 --> 00:58:46,745
Sorry President.

808
00:58:46,746 --> 00:58:48,720
Every newspaper and media got a call,

809
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:51,310
revealing President's past.

810
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,800
What?

811
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,800
No matter what, we have to block this.

812
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:56,765
No matter how much money we use,

813
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,480
We have to prevent the news
of this from coming out.

814
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,140
No, no. I'll have to go to the
police department myself.

815
00:59:03,175 --> 00:59:04,970
Hurry and get the car ready.

816
00:59:05,005 --> 00:59:05,960
Yes, President.

817
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,435
Those bastards.

818
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:11,495
Find the person who posted these up.

819
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:15,295
Arrest them for ruining
my reputation and fraud.

820
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:19,490
They also took the media.
I can't hold this in anymore.

821
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,680
If it's something that happened
25 years ago, we can't investigate it.

822
00:59:25,855 --> 00:59:27,920
But is this true?

823
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,165
If you don't believe me,

824
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,330
you can look at my company's secret books.

825
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:34,567
There is proof of the incident,

826
00:59:34,602 --> 00:59:36,770
there's also a record of the fees.

827
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,465
Who did it?

828
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,130
Nam Joo Seung or Joo Ah Ran?

829
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,562
The one who reported it to
the media was Joo Kyeong Ran.

830
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,760
Do you know her?

831
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,290
Joo Kyeong Ran?

832
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,870
Ah.

833
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,350
Yoon Jae Hee.

834
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:02,295
Mom, tell us.

835
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:04,330
What is this secret
that you're hiding from us?

836
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,820
No matter what the truth is,
we'll accept it.

837
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:12,607
Hyun Min, Hyun Ji, I'm sorry.

838
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:15,024
Sorry for what?

839
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,139
What's the reason for mother being like this?

840
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,688
I'm about to go crazy.

841
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,750
Joo Seung is my son whom I gave birth to.

842
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:31,730
It's Hyun Min's brother.

843
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:34,220
Also Hyun Ji's brother.

844
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:34,905
<i>Mom.</i>

845
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,255
This is impossible.

846
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:41,380
Joo Seung is Secretary Nam's son.

847
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:45,680
Sorry.

848
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,100
Forgive mother.

849
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:52,535
How can mother be like this?

850
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:54,985
Secretary Nam was always
like a brother to father.

851
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:57,400
How could someone who came
to our house for 30 years..

852
01:00:57,435 --> 01:01:01,200
You hid this from father for 30 years?

853
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:02,832
So when I said I wanted to marry,

854
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:05,900
you rejected, right?

855
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:10,350
<i>Taking revenge on father like that,
isn't it too low?</i>

856
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:15,160
If you hated father so much,
you could have just divorced.

857
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:19,270
I hate mother. I feel embarrassed.

858
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,770
I always thought father was too harsh.

859
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,850
<i>I felt sorry for you.</i>

860
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,730
<i>But it was like that?</i>

861
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,900
<i>The one who betrayed father and gave
our family such humiliation was you!</i>

862
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,450
Hyun Min.

863
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,430
Jae Hee is Ah Ran's younger sister.

864
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,780
Joo Seung is my younger brother.

865
01:01:47,815 --> 01:01:48,850
Is it like that?

866
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:51,905
<i>Why aren't you saying anything?</i>

867
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,440
If we knew earlier,
then we wouldn't be unfortunate like this.

868
01:01:55,475 --> 01:01:57,340
It's all my sin.

869
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:02,570
I know there's no point in saying anything.

870
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:08,850
But, why were you so
harsh towards Joo Seung?

871
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:14,340
Would you still be a mother when
you stabbed a knife into his heart?

872
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:18,450
If I didn't do that, I felt that I
would be discovered by your father.

873
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:20,575
<i>If your father found out.</i>

874
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,170
<i>Joo Seung and I wouldn't live on.</i>

875
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:30,320
No matter what,
I didn't want to ruin this family.

876
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,570
That heart is real.

877
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:36,680
Stop finding excuses in ignoring
Joo Seung and making him lonely.

878
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,745
It's because of mother's motherly love.

879
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:45,350
Since you gave birth,
at least become a mother.

880
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:46,942
How could you not know,

881
01:02:46,977 --> 01:02:48,465
To us, you were so caring,

882
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,260
To another person,
you became a deadly poisonous medicine.

883
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,390
Mom, you're just a cruel person?

884
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,690
You've received a great impact.

885
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,320
Go and find father.

886
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:18,350
Ah. Ah.

887
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,350
Ah!

888
01:03:53,100 --> 01:04:00,400
Hyun Woo. I came back because I
didn't want you to not have a father.

889
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,660
Was I wrong?

890
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:08,270
To give you a perfect family,

891
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,900
and the crime of letting ,
Joo Seung not have a mother

892
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,190
I've received my punishment now.

893
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,630
President.

894
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:39,400
Buy some wine. I want to drink.

895
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,360
Even though you're really tired,
I want you to know,

896
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,870
What?

897
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,955
The debt company sent their last notice.

898
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:51,270
If we can't block the promissory note by
tomorrow before the bank closes,

899
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,620
We'll go through the
first stage of bankruptcy.

900
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,330
Bankruptcy?

901
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:03,160
Soul needs to go bankrupt?

902
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:29,636
No. No.

903
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,360
This is all because of Joo Ah Ran.

904
01:05:40,830 --> 01:05:45,290
Joo Chul Min's daughter comes into our
family and my family goes bankrupt.

905
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:50,470
Then I'm a fool who's sitting
here waiting for death.

906
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,900
Secretary Kang.

907
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:52,730
Yes, President.

908
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,695
Contact the police department.

909
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:57,780
Let them start investigating
the fire incident.

910
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,680
Looks like Hyun Woo is softhearted
because of Joo Ah Ran's sister.

911
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:05,950
What that bastard can't do, I'll do.

912
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,950
Is it Ah Ran?

913
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,590
Is Joo Ah Ran inside?

914
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,470
We have to investigate the
fire incident in the mansion.

915
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,435
Joo Ah Ran isn't here.

916
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,460
Also, this isn't Joo Ah Ran's
house, it's my house.

917
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:25,450
If she comes over, I'll contact you.
Please leave.

918
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,380
Then we'll wait outside.

919
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,730
It's me. Don't come home.

920
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,105
The police are looking for you.

921
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:44,840
If you receive investigation
then you'll definitely be charged.

922
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,202
I'll do something about it.

923
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:49,530
Find a hotel or sauna and hide.

924
01:06:49,565 --> 01:06:51,340
Don't use a car either.

925
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,900
Can you hear me?

926
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,250
What do you want me to do?

927
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:20,390
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

928
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:28,130
If you want me to leave, I'll leave.
If you want to divorce, I'll agree.

929
01:07:28,165 --> 01:07:34,680
Who agrees on divorce? Divorce?
Stop dreaming.

930
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:38,340
What deed am I doing by divorcing?

931
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:42,270
Turning the family into this.

932
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:45,280
You want to live peacefully,
is that what you mean?

933
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:47,630
Then what do you want me to do?

934
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:51,850
Do you want me to be a sinner
to you and the kids,

935
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:58,460
and bow down waiting to
die for my whole life?

936
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:03,520
What did you do right?
You're still talking back.

937
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,390
I won't forgive and I won't forget.

938
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:12,700
You'll live like a criminal without
knowing when you'll die.

939
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,450
You'll pay for your crimes for betraying
your husband and then leave.

940
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:22,450
I'm also human.

941
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,730
I can also get angry. If you hit me,
I'll also scream because of pain.

942
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:28,950
I'm a person with feelings.

943
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,210
Did you turn crazy? You.

944
01:08:31,245 --> 01:08:33,120
Yes, I'm crazy.

945
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:36,780
I should be crazy since
you torture me like this.

946
01:08:36,983 --> 01:08:39,800
Even if I'm a maid who prepares
your food for my whole life,

947
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,470
You can't treat me like this.

948
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,660
Now you're going to talk
about making food?

949
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,480
Then, do other Ahjummas
not do that and play?

950
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:54,770
Don't say that everything is my wrong.

951
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:57,900
If you've looked at me
even once as your wife,

952
01:08:57,935 --> 01:09:00,570
No, looked at me as a human.

953
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,550
I wouldn't have given birth
to Joo Seung painfully.

954
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:13,310
Ah. What you mean is that
you're wrong was my fault.

955
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:16,470
I really regret not leaving you that time.

956
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,755
Not resisting against your violence.

957
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:23,840
I endured it because of the children.
I really regret.

958
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:29,480
I want to give up on being your wife.

959
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,730
I don't want to beg for forgiveness.

960
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,110
I want to go on my own road.

961
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:08,830
Honey.

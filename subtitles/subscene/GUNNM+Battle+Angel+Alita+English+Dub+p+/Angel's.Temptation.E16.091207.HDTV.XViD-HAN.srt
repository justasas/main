00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:03,795
Temptation Of An Angel

2
00:00:00,105 --> 00:00:03,795
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,457
Joo Ah Ran, right?

4
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:22,065
I'm the police.

5
00:00:22,185 --> 00:00:24,360
Let's take a trip to the station.

6
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:27,243
What is the matter?

7
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,790
October 13,the traffic accident
that took place on Chang Won Street,

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,267
here is the statement for the real criminal,
Joo Ah Ran.

9
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:40,268
Who wrote this?

10
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:42,240
Shin Hyun Woo this.

11
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:44,211
Shin Hyun Woo.

12
00:00:45,611 --> 00:00:47,074
That's ridiculous.

13
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,732
How could a dead person write a statement.

14
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:52,297
Let's talk about it in the station.

15
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,941
Come to the police station immediately.

16
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,215
The police came to look for
me all of a sudden,

17
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,438
with Shin Hyun Woo's statement, saying that
I was the perpetrator of the traffic accident.

18
00:01:36,558 --> 00:01:37,943
I'll go now.

19
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:39,703
Try and delay some time.

20
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:42,252
Don't panic,
and speak as little as possible.

21
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,358
Shin Hyun Woo...

22
00:01:50,335 --> 00:01:52,243
your real intentions are finally revealed.

23
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,529
It's me, Jae Sung.

24
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,972
Are you busy?

25
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:23,177
I have to reserve plane tickets.

26
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,852
Where are you?

27
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,460
I have something on, I'm far away.

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,751
I'll call you when it's done.

29
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,558
My husband is dead.

30
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:49,035
Someone must be using my
husband's name to play a trick.

31
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:52,844
The death certificate hasn't been issued,
how can he be dead?

32
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:58,952
The fingerprint on the statement,
has been verified as Shin Hyun Woo's.

33
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:03,873
If Shin Hyun Woo is alive,
then call him to come here.

34
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,857
If not,
we can't cooperate with this investigation.

35
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:08,529
That's right.

36
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:11,386
When my husband met with an accident,
I wasn't even there.

37
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:12,994
If it's true...

38
00:03:13,114 --> 00:03:14,962
I want to confront Shin Hyun Woo.

39
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,714
And then,
I'll accept my punishment willingly.

40
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,025
Episode 16

41
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,506
Really...

42
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,975
really,
Shin Hyun Woo is alive?

43
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:38,493
The words on the statement,
is definitely Shin Hyun Woo's.

44
00:03:38,613 --> 00:03:40,896
Even if he's alive, we don't have to worry.

45
00:03:41,016 --> 00:03:43,202
We already know the intentions
and plans of the other side,

46
00:03:43,322 --> 00:03:45,763
and we definitely won't suffer easily.

47
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,933
How was the search for the plastic
surgery results at the medical insurance company?

48
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,544
I'm about to go now.

49
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:52,856
Get up.

50
00:03:52,976 --> 00:03:54,761
Because of the rule against
personal information,

51
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,915
we cannot make personal
medical information public.

52
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:04,055
Hold on.

53
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:06,891
If Shin Hyun Woo is alive...

54
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:09,261
he must have carried out bank transactions.

55
00:04:09,381 --> 00:04:11,698
We have to look into the banking transactions
that Shin Hyun woo made after the fire.

56
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,492
It wasn't even him,
what's there to look into?

57
00:04:14,612 --> 00:04:16,524
Only one side can win.

58
00:04:17,328 --> 00:04:19,360
Let's go look for the police...

59
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,436
and prove that my husband disappeared
in his vegetative state, to seek help.

60
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,802
Then, we'll find the bank
that cooperated with Shin Hyun Woo,

61
00:04:27,922 --> 00:04:31,103
and look at the CCTV,
it should have Shin Hyun Woo's face on it.

62
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,329
It's Ahn Jae Sung!

63
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:01,990
How can that be?

64
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,907
Then...

65
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,748
Nothing has changed.

66
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:14,478
We just have to do as we planned,
organize everything and get out of here.

67
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:17,223
Ahn Jae Sung goes back to being
Shin Hyun Woo,

68
00:05:17,343 --> 00:05:20,757
and before he reveals everything,
we have to be on a plane, no matter what.

69
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,641
Why are you in a daze?

70
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:29,254
Are you that disappointed
that Ahn Jae Sung is Shin Hyun Woo?

71
00:05:30,588 --> 00:05:33,932
Did you really...
fall in love with him?

72
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:35,032
No.

73
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:39,944
- I just can't accept what I've been through.
- Don't think about it.

74
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,314
He just returned the favor.

75
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:45,341
Today, I'll take care of
the hospital and the apartment.

76
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,022
<i>You do the same thing.</i>

77
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:49,964
I know.

78
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,435
He camouflaged himself
so perfectly as Ahn Jae Sung,

79
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:56,567
yet, he got still hilariously
got caught by the CCTV,

80
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,420
if it wasn't for revenge,
would he have changed his face?

81
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,558
When he found out that we left,

82
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:06,796
he would wail and cry to the heavens,
wouldn't he.

83
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,580
Heaven is on our side.

84
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,467
What happened?

85
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,001
The fact that Ahjussi is Shin Hyun Woo,
have they found out?

86
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,096
If the two of them leave,

87
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,585
won't Ahjussi's revenge end?

88
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:34,638
He's waiting so long, enduring so much.

89
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,958
Please arrange the seats a little closer.

90
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:39,793
Yes, I know.

91
00:06:39,794 --> 00:06:43,127
So the guests can look forward
a little easier.

92
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:45,392
Please change the lights.

93
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:54,150
It's me, Ah Ran.

94
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:57,918
I'm looking at the wedding hall.

95
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,722
In order to welcome the most
beautiful bride,

96
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,351
I can't be sloppy.

97
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:04,574
<i>I have something to say,
let's meet.</i>

98
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,605
<i>I'll call you once I'm there.</i>

99
00:07:22,787 --> 00:07:24,353
Yoon Jae Hee.

100
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:28,310
You knew everything right
from the beginning,

101
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,961
and you were planning to fool me?

102
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,344
I have nothing,
that I can say to Madam anymore.

103
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,238
Don't toy with me.

104
00:07:38,021 --> 00:07:41,492
If I have a crime to shoulder,
God will give it to me.

105
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,612
Who are you to meddle between
a husband and wife?

106
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,901
Husband and wife?

107
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:51,097
Since when were you husband
and wife with Shin Hyun Woo?

108
00:07:51,217 --> 00:07:52,892
If you were really husband and wife...

109
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:56,003
would you lock your husband in
a countryside villa that had no doctors?

110
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,077
If you were really husband and wife...

111
00:07:58,197 --> 00:08:01,717
would you be intimate with another
mean while your husband was fighting for his life?

112
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,608
Now you're unbosoming yourself.

113
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,956
So, the Shin Hyun Woo that couldn't take it,
you wanted to help him?

114
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:16,142
From that guy's vegetative state
to his plastic surgery, you wanted to help him?

115
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,907
Then,
that man would become yours?

116
00:08:19,027 --> 00:08:22,738
I heard,
you're getting married to President Ahn.

117
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:26,628
The beautiful bride's mouth
is a little uncouth, isn't it.

118
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,882
This time,
please, don't betray President Ahn.

119
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:40,343
Ahn Jae Sung.

120
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,459
Yoon Jae Hee.

121
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,311
You actually made me become this pathetic.

122
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,478
Manager, what are you doing?

123
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,732
If Hyung comes back, I want to
change all the furniture in Hyung's house.

124
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:04,711
Hyungsoo is out too, in order to forget
the nightmare, I want to change it all.

125
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,301
After she moved out,
what is Ah Ran doing?

126
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,544
There's nowhere she can go.

127
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:12,576
How can there be nowhere for her to go?

128
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:15,433
She probably went to the house
of the man she's crazily in love with.

129
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:19,081
But,
what has Yeon Jae been doing?

130
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:22,594
I've been decorating the newlyweds' section.

131
00:09:22,714 --> 00:09:25,432
A new house, just like the newlyweds,
I tried to decorate it.

132
00:09:25,552 --> 00:09:26,892
How is it?

133
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:28,416
Is it childish?

134
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:32,183
No.

135
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:35,167
It's warm and touching, it's good.

136
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:36,416
Just like Yeon Jae.

137
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,848
Really, really, really, really.

138
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:44,827
That...

139
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:48,102
Should we...
lie down and try it out?

140
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:51,340
We have to know how comfortable
it is before we introduce it to our customers.

141
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:58,343
Yeon Jae,
what should we do if customers come?

142
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:02,829
Hyun Min, it's been a while
since we laid down together.

143
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:04,733
<i>Ahjussi, it's good.</i>

144
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:09,074
Hug me.
Hug me tighter!

145
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:14,809
You're really humorous,
and cute and charming.

146
00:10:20,023 --> 00:10:23,324
Why are you so cute, witty and lovable?

147
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:26,505
I really want to put you in a gourd,
and take you out every day.

148
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,566
You probably couldn't fit me into a gourd.

149
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:43,161
Yes, Father?

150
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,537
Father,
what do you mean?

151
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,614
The MyeongSung investment is fake.

152
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:53,957
This is a fax that just came
from MyeongSung.

153
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:58,959
The intention that they had to invest in Soul,
there isn't any in the future.

154
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:01,223
I was fooled again by that fox.

155
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,371
After we uncovered her job at the bar...

156
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,149
she tried various ways and means to get by.

157
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,753
After she got some time, I don't
know what else she was planning to do with Soul.

158
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:13,002
Secretary Kang.

159
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:14,907
Get me Joo Ah Ran's sales report.

160
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:16,071
Yes, President.

161
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,552
This definitely is fake too.

162
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,986
She must have withdrawn
all the investment in Soul...

163
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:27,056
and then pulled her tricks.

164
00:11:27,176 --> 00:11:28,777
<i>Everyone work up some energy...</i>

165
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,374
<i>and thoroughly verify the sales
reports from all the different showrooms.</i>

166
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,644
Yes, Father.

167
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,052
Secretary Kang.

168
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,354
You're here.

169
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:58,020
I wanted to eat lunch with you,
so I was waiting.

170
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,243
We have to book the plane tickets, right?

171
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:01,893
Could you give me your passport?

172
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,667
My friend works at a travel agency,
I'll book the plane tickets.

173
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:07,276
I've already asked someone to do it.

174
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:08,482
Don't worry,

175
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,789
you just have to show up at
the airport on time.

176
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:11,932
Hold on.

177
00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:18,609
<i>It must be Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

178
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:21,635
<i>There can't be a passport
with Ahn Jae Sung's name on it.</i>

179
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,455
<i>How did he survive?</i>

180
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:25,857
<i>Was he not at the villa during the fire?</i>

181
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:27,741
<i>But why didn't he come back?</i>

182
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:30,852
<i>Who did he want to drive insane,
that he pulled these tricks?</i>

183
00:12:41,972 --> 00:12:43,220
<i>It's a good shot, right?</i>

184
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,845
The last time we went to the park,
I took it,

185
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:49,106
and I put it here to look
at it every time I thought of you.

186
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:51,498
I'm hungry,
let's hurry and go.

187
00:13:00,356 --> 00:13:01,520
Yoon Jae Hee.

188
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:08,337
Don't misunderstand.

189
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:11,067
The other time Jae Hee brought it,

190
00:13:11,187 --> 00:13:13,311
and it wasn't nice to throw it away,
so I left it.

191
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:15,787
This photograph has no other meaning.

192
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:18,484
Do you expect me to believe that right now?

193
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:22,209
Your love, sometimes there are two,
sometimes there are three.

194
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:24,622
I can't believe this kind of man,
and fly to America.

195
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,378
Let's break up.

196
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:27,923
What did you say?

197
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:30,587
We've even booked the wedding hall.

198
00:13:30,707 --> 00:13:31,878
Now, you want to cancel the wedding?

199
00:13:31,998 --> 00:13:34,714
The person who betrayed our trust first wasn't me,
but Jae Sung.

200
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:35,959
Let's not talk about anything else,

201
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,753
but I can't start with a man
who thinks about other women in his heart.

202
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,891
You won't regret this?

203
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:50,648
A woman who leaves once,

204
00:13:50,768 --> 00:13:52,913
I'm not a man that will chase after her.

205
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,720
Of course.

206
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,556
Our destiny ends here.

207
00:13:57,676 --> 00:14:00,265
Let's not meet till the day we die.

208
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,784
<i>Ah Ran!</i>

209
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:10,426
<i>Shin Hyun Woo is back.</i>

210
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:13,093
<i>The person who was always
by my side was Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

211
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:14,549
<i>I have to get away quickly.</i>

212
00:14:14,669 --> 00:14:17,300
<i>Once that man opens his mouth,
it's all over.</i>

213
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:23,565
Joo Seung, it's me.

214
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,598
About us leaving, hurry.

215
00:14:25,718 --> 00:14:28,455
It's too scary,
I don't even want to stay another day.

216
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,912
Our son, Hyun Woo,

217
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:38,859
disappeared during the fire,

218
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:42,880
he must be living somewhere now,
so I came to look for help.

219
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:46,893
I was just about to look for Shin
Hyun Woo's family, good thing you came.

220
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:48,967
Actually, yesterday...

221
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,269
a statement about the traffic
accident at Chang Won...

222
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,618
came from Shin Hyun Woo.

223
00:14:57,123 --> 00:14:58,562
What?

224
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:02,498
From our Hyun Woo?

225
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,962
The statement says that,
at the time of the accident,

226
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:09,930
the driver was Joo Ah Ran

227
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,491
and said that she ran away
after the accident.

228
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:15,801
Then, our Hyun Woo...

229
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:18,002
Can you contact him?

230
00:15:18,122 --> 00:15:19,547
Where is Hyun Woo?

231
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:22,891
Where can I go to see him?
Please tell me, Officer.

232
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:25,621
The phone number didn't show up.

233
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:29,035
I contacted him,
and told him to show up before 3.

234
00:15:29,155 --> 00:15:31,659
During this period of time,
we'll ask Joo Ah Ran here as well.

235
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:33,655
Then,
you're saying that at 3,

236
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:37,547
our Hyun Woo will be here?

237
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,289
Hello?

238
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:44,622
Yes,

239
00:15:44,742 --> 00:15:46,506
I'm Joo Ah Ran.

240
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,876
What?

241
00:15:48,996 --> 00:15:51,282
To have a confrontation with Shin Hyun Woo?

242
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:55,896
Shin Hyun Woo is going to
the police station?

243
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:54,546
It's me.

244
00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:57,700
Don't be nervous.
No matter what, face it calmly.

245
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,848
Hyun Woo Hyung is not showing up.
No, he can't show up.

246
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,115
If he wanted to use the law
from the beginning,

247
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:06,802
he wouldn't return in Ahn Jae Sung's skin.

248
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:10,097
Furthermore,
there is no evidence...

249
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,340
the police can't do anything to you.

250
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,303
Joo Ah Ran one-sidedly called
off the wedding?

251
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:20,584
Even though she gave me a different reason,

252
00:17:21,113 --> 00:17:23,822
Even though she gave me a different reason,

253
00:17:24,301 --> 00:17:27,285
but, I feel like she's found
out my identity.

254
00:17:27,405 --> 00:17:30,931
You mean she knows that
President Ahn is her ex-husband?

255
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,047
That's big.

256
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:38,677
We haven't received all the assets that
are under Joo Ah Ran's name, it can't end here.

257
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:44,897
If she knows I'm Shin Hyun Woo,
there will be no way to capture her heart.

258
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:48,156
No matter what, she'll find a way to escape.

259
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,536
If tonight, Joo Ah Ran and
Nam Joo Seung leaves tonight...

260
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,144
our game is over.

261
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,224
<i>No!</i>

262
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:56,425
We definitely cannot give up.

263
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:58,435
In front of Sang Mo's altar,

264
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,546
I promised to dispel any remaining
hate he had.

265
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:04,776
<i>Because I believed you,
I made it here.</i>

266
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:07,870
No matter what happens, don't disappoint me.

267
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:14,738
Now, at the police station,

268
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:18,187
they're waiting for me to
confront Joo Ah Ran.

269
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,367
If I don't appear...

270
00:18:20,487 --> 00:18:24,206
then, it's equivalent to putting
wings on someone who's about to escape,

271
00:18:24,326 --> 00:18:28,587
as well as confirm the belief,
that Shin Hyun Woo is Ahn Jae Sung.

272
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,549
Looks like the confrontation has
to be postponed.

273
00:18:47,015 --> 00:18:49,343
That's why I said...

274
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,539
it looks like someone is playing a trick.

275
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:57,556
That fake statement,
please remember that it has no legal implications.

276
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:58,974
No!

277
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,387
It's definitely a statement
that our Hyun Woo sent.

278
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,223
If that's the case,
why hasn't he appeared by now?

279
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,912
There are two reasons.

280
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,389
One is that the contents
of the statement are fake.

281
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:13,611
Or, the fact that he's alive is a lie.

282
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,431
My son is alive!

283
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,133
He won't die from that little burn.

284
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,133
Are you more comfortable thinking that way?

285
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,183
A son that's dead and can't come back,

286
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:29,823
or a son that's not dead and can't come back,
what's the difference?

287
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:39,120
Tell me!

288
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,911
Did you hide Hyun Woo?

289
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:43,345
If not, Hyun Woo does not have
a reason to hide.

290
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:45,334
What did you do to Hyun Woo?

291
00:19:45,454 --> 00:19:49,313
The traffic accident, the fire at the villa,
it was all done by you!

292
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:54,164
Before I reply,
Mum has to explain herself.

293
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:56,006
Nothing else is needed.

294
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,529
Tell me!

295
00:19:57,649 --> 00:20:01,127
Where is Joo Kyeong Ran?

296
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:03,109
What?

297
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:04,442
Joo Kyeong Ran?

298
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,538
Where did you leave that child?

299
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:07,973
<i>Tell me!</i>

300
00:20:08,393 --> 00:20:09,691
You have to tell me.

301
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:13,838
I don't know where you heard that from,
but that has nothing to do with you.

302
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,758
Who says it has nothing to do with me?

303
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,769
What?

304
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,536
Did you leave that child at the
Angel Orphanage?

305
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:25,421
What did you do to that poor child?

306
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:27,728
For someone who is so cold
to even the own son that she birthed,

307
00:20:27,848 --> 00:20:30,881
would you look at someone else's child?

308
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:34,440
How cruel Mother is as a person,
Mother knows best!

309
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,006
What are you doing?

310
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:37,890
You have no reason to know!

311
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,752
Bring Kyeong Ran here.

312
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,610
If something happens to that child,
I'll never forgive you.

313
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,214
Not just Shin Hyun Woo,

314
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:47,156
I won't let the rest of your children off!

315
00:20:54,696 --> 00:20:55,945
Are you fine?

316
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:58,230
Oh, I'm fine.

317
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,130
Let's just go.

318
00:21:14,678 --> 00:21:17,302
How does Ah Ran know about Kyeong Ran?

319
00:21:19,567 --> 00:21:22,530
Joo Ah Ran,
Joo Kyeong Ran...

320
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,852
it can't be?

321
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,273
President, we've found out where the restaurant
that Joo Chul Ming's brother is at right now.

322
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,051
Is that so?
Toad like creatures.

323
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:33,596
This time we can never let them go.

324
00:21:33,716 --> 00:21:36,479
Call the restaurant,
and tell them to lock it up!

325
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,341
Lead the way.

326
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:46,277
I might as well just
pull my teeth out with pliers.

327
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:49,313
Eating soup and rice, what good is my teeth.

328
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,768
I still have to brush them in the morning,
how annoying.

329
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:54,308
Then just go pull them all out.

330
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:56,742
As you grow older,
people should be more sensible.

331
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,452
The money hasn't even fallen
from the sky yet,

332
00:21:58,572 --> 00:22:00,568
and you want to eat galbi that much...

333
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,397
Where are the people?!

334
00:22:07,517 --> 00:22:09,280
Is it this restaurant?

335
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,333
How did they find us here?

336
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:14,148
Shut up and let's run away!

337
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:28,589
What should we do now?!

338
00:22:28,709 --> 00:22:32,187
Looks like you got some courage.

339
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,950
You think by threatening me,
I would take out even 10 dollars?

340
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,368
Secretary Kang.

341
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:39,565
Call the police immediately.

342
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,565
Wait...

343
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:45,773
what crime did we commit,
that you have to call the police?

344
00:22:45,893 --> 00:22:48,933
That... Your wife was the
one who took away our Kyeong Ran,

345
00:22:49,053 --> 00:22:51,071
will the police leave it alone?

346
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:55,393
So,
hurry and give us our Kyeong Ran!

347
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:57,763
Who took who away?

348
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,573
Do you want to get arrested
for threatening and blackmailing me?

349
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:06,072
That...President,
we are really wronged.

350
00:23:06,192 --> 00:23:08,142
That is.. President, your wife,
took my dead brother's daughter,

351
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,216
and she's hiding her and not
giving her back.

352
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,009
Can we just stand on the sidelines?

353
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:14,830
What, daughter?

354
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:26,103
What is the matter?

355
00:23:26,223 --> 00:23:28,067
Who is Ah Ran?

356
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,475
Who are her parents?
You know, right?

357
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:35,242
I don't know.
I've never met them.

358
00:23:35,362 --> 00:23:38,848
Are Ah Ran's parents still alive?

359
00:23:40,076 --> 00:23:43,293
I heard they died on the
same day when she was young.

360
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,108
They died on the same day?

361
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,356
Why?

362
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:49,860
Is it someone you know?

363
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:52,167
No.

364
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:55,088
Then, go home safely.

365
00:24:00,885 --> 00:24:03,277
Ah Ran... how could it be?

366
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:06,409
It can't be.
That's ridiculous.

367
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,654
You tell me honestly.

368
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:20,655
What happened to Joo Chul Ming's daughter?

369
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:22,581
Honey...

370
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,750
That family said,
you took their daughter away.

371
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,459
- What does that mean?
- It's not that!

372
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:32,396
It was really sad for her to lose both
her parents, so I just helped a little. Really.

373
00:24:32,516 --> 00:24:33,750
You helped them?

374
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,549
Are you crazy?

375
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:37,919
It's fine that we gave them
so much compensation.

376
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,655
All my hard-earned money...

377
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:42,322
what charitable heart was that?

378
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,481
Hurry and tell that family,
where their daughter is,

379
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,873
and chase those leeches away, immediately!

380
00:24:46,993 --> 00:24:48,714
I really don't know.

381
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:51,810
I helped after the accident,
but I haven't heard anything after that.

382
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,292
Those words are true right?

383
00:24:53,412 --> 00:24:57,821
Then, if those fellows hang around our door,
call the police.

384
00:24:57,941 --> 00:25:03,425
I don't ever want to hear the
name of the annoying Joo Chul Ming again!

385
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:04,991
I know.

386
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:06,473
I know.

387
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,194
Ah Ran.

388
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:27,691
Let's meet.
I have something to say.

389
00:25:29,326 --> 00:25:30,342
Ah Ran.

390
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,739
Ah Ran!

391
00:25:36,966 --> 00:25:39,062
<i>Looks like our destiny ends here.</i>

392
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:40,845
<i>Let's not meet till the day we die.</i>

393
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:43,702
<i>Because I believed you,
I've come this far.</i>

394
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:46,686
<i>No matter what, don't disappoint me.</i>

395
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:48,254
I hoped that Ahjussi and
Joo Ah Ran wouldn't get married...

396
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:52,561
that would be a good thing for me.

397
00:26:54,106 --> 00:26:56,582
But why...
am I not happy at all?

398
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:02,096
Looking at Ahjussi’s sadness...

399
00:27:03,006 --> 00:27:05,927
my heart hurts so much it's
going to explode.

400
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:20,655
Ahjussi!
What's wrong?

401
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:22,327
Where does it hurt?
Ahjussi!

402
00:28:22,447 --> 00:28:24,888
Don't look at me,
don't look at me!

403
00:28:27,682 --> 00:28:29,704
I don't want you to see me this way...

404
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,228
go home!

405
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,609
Ahjussi,
must you definitely carry out that revenge?

406
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:40,591
If I can't fill Ahjussi up with my love,

407
00:28:41,162 --> 00:28:43,829
if there's only that way,

408
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,453
I lose.

409
00:28:46,573 --> 00:28:48,549
Marry Joo Ah Ran.

410
00:28:49,948 --> 00:28:53,016
Even if you can't return to my side...

411
00:28:58,498 --> 00:29:00,699
I will let Ahjussi go too.

412
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,343
<i>With me...</i>

413
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,243
<i>Marry me.</i>

414
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:16,135
Your sister...

415
00:30:16,255 --> 00:30:17,870
even if you don't show up,

416
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,262
we can use someone to find her.

417
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:23,564
If she's living somewhere,
we'll find her.

418
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:24,918
No.

419
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,444
I must see Kyeong Ran with
my own eyes before I leave.

420
00:30:28,564 --> 00:30:30,264
There's no time.

421
00:30:30,384 --> 00:30:34,878
Just now, Madam came,
and asked about your parents.

422
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,654
Whose daughter you are,
they could probably guess.

423
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:41,088
It doesn't matter anymore.

424
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:44,411
Everything will be fine
as long as I find Kyeong Ran.

425
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,133
We have to go to the showroom
to take a look.

426
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,539
There are documents I have to take care of.

427
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:09,447
<i>Is this Doctor Nam's apartment?</i>

428
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,775
The lights are turned
on in the apartment right now.

429
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,828
It seems she hasn't left yet.

430
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:17,574
She transferred the hospital today,
it seems she's about to leave.

431
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:21,307
Before that, you have to hand all
the evidence to the police.

432
00:31:21,857 --> 00:31:24,121
Are you done with your treatment?

433
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:26,978
<i>I'm going to the hospital right now.</i>

434
00:31:30,338 --> 00:31:31,820
What?

435
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:35,481
Shin Hyun Woo is in the hospital right now?

436
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:47,805
Shin Hyun Woo!

437
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:52,271
That was clearly Shin Hyun Woo.

438
00:32:53,122 --> 00:32:55,302
With a burn scar even.

439
00:32:58,074 --> 00:33:00,424
That was definitely Shin Hyun Woo,
no mistake.

440
00:33:00,544 --> 00:33:02,794
Not Ahn Jae Sung.

441
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:19,365
I can't be completely sure.

442
00:33:19,485 --> 00:33:22,222
Shin Hyun Woo was sitting next to her.

443
00:33:22,773 --> 00:33:24,441
Just like at the villa,

444
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:27,679
it might be a model of Shin Hyun Woo.

445
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,939
I have to be careful.

446
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:40,743
Is this Korea Hospital?

447
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:43,241
I just wanted to check...

448
00:33:43,361 --> 00:33:45,653
was there a patient by the name
of Shin Hyun Woo?

449
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,832
He just left after being treated for burns?

450
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:55,928
I understand.

451
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,240
Then...

452
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,372
is it really Shin Hyun Woo?

453
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:22,804
Ah Ran.

454
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,169
When have you been home since?

455
00:34:33,289 --> 00:34:35,560
Just now... Did you go out?

456
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,830
No.

457
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,509
I came home really early,
I've been home since.

458
00:34:48,392 --> 00:34:52,116
The last time of entry, 6.20 p.m.

459
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:54,423
Then...

460
00:34:54,804 --> 00:34:58,042
<i>just now, that person was
really Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

461
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,720
Why?
Is something the matter?

462
00:35:05,434 --> 00:35:08,566
Just sit down first,
you don't look so well,

463
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,793
I'll make you a hot cup of tea.

464
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:56,754
<i>That's right.</i>

465
00:35:56,874 --> 00:35:59,421
<i>He has identification cards and a passport,</i>

466
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,770
<i>he can't be Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

467
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:10,978
Jae Sung.

468
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,271
I'm sorry.

469
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:15,684
I must have been crazy.

470
00:36:15,804 --> 00:36:18,096
I actually didn't believe you.

471
00:36:18,477 --> 00:36:21,208
What kind of person are you to me?

472
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:24,281
Forgive me.

473
00:36:24,401 --> 00:36:27,011
I'll do anything to appease your anger.

474
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:55,086
So...

475
00:36:55,206 --> 00:36:57,499
you saw me being captured on the CCTV,

476
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:59,996
and came to the conclusion
that I was Shin Hyun Woo.

477
00:37:00,116 --> 00:37:04,140
The two of you went on the same
day to the same bank, isn't that strange?

478
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:10,129
That bank is close to our company,
so I'm a VIP there.

479
00:37:10,249 --> 00:37:13,348
I was too impulsive,
and I didn't think too much,

480
00:37:13,468 --> 00:37:15,041
I'm really sorry.

481
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,720
Thinking about the fact that
Ah Ran doesn't trust me up till now,

482
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,561
it hurts me.

483
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,434
The reason why you can't trust me,
is my fault.

484
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:33,202
We'll hold the wedding as planned,
and then go together to America.

485
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:37,329
The company matters are almost settled,
and I have nothing to hold on to here.

486
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:41,033
The reason for your sudden rush,
is it because of your ex-husband?

487
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:44,307
Is there a reason Shin
Hyun Woo shouldn't be alive?

488
00:37:46,846 --> 00:37:48,222
That man...

489
00:37:48,615 --> 00:37:51,176
won't quietly let me go.

490
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:54,223
Even though we're in the
process of getting a divorce,

491
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:58,414
he'll grab me by my ankles,
and get in the way of my future happiness.

492
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:03,304
From now on...

493
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:06,584
I want to be happy as the woman of one man.

494
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:13,942
Just like other people,
to fight as a couple over something small,

495
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:21,137
to birth a baby that looks like you,
and have him call me mum,

496
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,899
to go to the amusement park,

497
00:38:27,274 --> 00:38:29,835
to have water fights,

498
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,544
in a garden that has a
sign with our last name on it,

499
00:38:32,664 --> 00:38:34,723
I want to live like that.

500
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:40,878
If I could be greedy for things like that,

501
00:38:41,302 --> 00:38:43,164
please don't abandon me.

502
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:56,726
Now, the life that you're dreaming of,

503
00:38:57,276 --> 00:39:00,387
is the married life, that I dreamt of once.

504
00:39:01,234 --> 00:39:05,134
Even though I was trampled on by one woman.

505
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:16,732
Since it's a choice between life and death...

506
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:20,605
you have to be happy.

507
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:23,822
I only want one thing.

508
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,859
No matter who you're with...

509
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:31,203
as long as Ahjussi is content.

510
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,703
I'm happy too.

511
00:39:56,338 --> 00:39:58,370
<i>Don't wait for me, go sleep first.</i>

512
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:01,846
<i>There's a lot to organize,
I'll sleep at the showroom tonight.</i>

513
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,603
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

514
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:09,574
<i>Joo Ah Ran,
it's been a long time.</i>

515
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:11,627
<i>Have you been well?</i>

516
00:41:11,923 --> 00:41:14,823
<i>I came to this earth to see you now.</i>

517
00:41:14,943 --> 00:41:17,257
<i>I'm looking forward to seeing you.</i>

518
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:20,579
<i>From, the Romeo who had his heart stolen.</i>

519
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,979
The Romeo who had his heart stolen...

520
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:30,693
That was the nickname that
only I and Shin Hyun Woo knew.

521
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,615
What are you doing?

522
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,117
Who are you?

523
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:11,493
Who let you in?

524
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,165
Who let you in?

525
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:18,325
We inspected closely,
there's nothing special in particular.

526
00:42:18,445 --> 00:42:21,647
However, there is quite a bit of male clothing,
and medicine to treat burns.

527
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:23,044
Is that so?

528
00:42:23,164 --> 00:42:25,090
I get it.
Go out first.

529
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,877
For a place where a girl stays by herself,
there's quite a lot of male clothing.

530
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,797
Antiseptic, sedatives,

531
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,781
what are these?

532
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,140
Hurry and get out.

533
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,558
This is my house.

534
00:42:43,678 --> 00:42:45,611
You're still lying to me till the end.

535
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:50,817
You've been hiding Shin Hyun Woo,
and giving him treatment?

536
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,583
I have to go to work,
please let me through.

537
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,033
I saw it with my own eyes.

538
00:42:58,153 --> 00:43:00,593
You took Shin Hyun Woo from the hospital.

539
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,403
Where did you hide him,
what tricks are you trying to play?

540
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:07,350
Now you know.

541
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,451
That's right.

542
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,483
I love Shin Hyun Woo.

543
00:43:10,603 --> 00:43:14,201
The person I love isn't President Ahn,
it's Shin Hyun Woo.

544
00:43:14,321 --> 00:43:16,085
Is that so?

545
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:18,921
To hide Shin Hyun Woo...

546
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,642
all this time, you've been pretending
to be in love with President Ahn?

547
00:43:20,762 --> 00:43:23,584
Anyway, he's not a man you loved.

548
00:43:23,704 --> 00:43:26,674
What's wrong if I love him?

549
00:43:26,794 --> 00:43:28,421
Betrayed by his wife,

550
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:30,368
a car accident,
and a fire,

551
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:33,021
that person's body and mind
are already riddled with bullet holes.

552
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:35,955
If I love him,
and care for him, what's so wrong with that?

553
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,220
If you like Shin Hyun Woo that much,

554
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,723
then the two of you should run away,
and live quietly like dead people.

555
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:42,416
Why did you come back?

556
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,659
Why do you want to force people
to their death?

557
00:43:44,779 --> 00:43:46,395
Are you that scared?

558
00:43:46,515 --> 00:43:49,210
Now, kneel in front of
that person and beg for mercy,

559
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:50,623
sincerely repent,

560
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:52,528
and say you were sincerely
accept the punishments for your sins!

561
00:43:55,682 --> 00:43:58,205
I don't have any thoughts of
begging for forgiveness from that person.

562
00:43:58,818 --> 00:44:01,506
My wounds are still being ripped apart...

563
00:44:01,626 --> 00:44:04,639
what does that person's pain
have to do with me?

564
00:44:05,633 --> 00:44:08,820
The way you look,
arrogant because you saved someone's life...

565
00:44:09,265 --> 00:44:11,614
there won't be a second time.

566
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,625
God is fair.

567
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:21,757
Ahjussi...

568
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,868
I'm fine.

569
00:44:25,376 --> 00:44:28,064
I'm actually feeling refreshed.

570
00:44:29,005 --> 00:44:31,100
In front of Joo Ah Ran,

571
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,677
I could even say I like Ahjussi out loud.

572
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:38,126
It was good.

573
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,850
President!
Something big has happened!

574
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:53,085
President has sent an auditor,
to redo the last 6 months of sale figures.

575
00:44:53,205 --> 00:44:55,879
The sales section and the invoice
section has to be investigated.

576
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:57,484
What?

577
00:44:57,604 --> 00:44:59,346
Did people in the two sections
spout nonsense?

578
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:01,717
No.
No one said anything to anyone.

579
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:05,293
I understand.
Go and work.

580
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:12,217
That old fox might have suspected
something again.

581
00:45:12,337 --> 00:45:14,460
If Soul is not snatched away,

582
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,402
I can only transfer all
my assets to Jae Sung's name.

583
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,477
No...

584
00:45:21,175 --> 00:45:23,715
Care makes everything go smoothly.

585
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:26,932
Before that, I have to verify something.

586
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,449
If Jae Hee didn't help...

587
00:45:31,569 --> 00:45:34,370
all my plans would have been ruined.

588
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,735
It's all because of
Ahjussi’s model of Shin Hyun Woo.

589
00:45:37,855 --> 00:45:42,321
As planned, Joo Ah Ran even
called the Korea Hospital to verify it.

590
00:45:42,441 --> 00:45:46,384
Luckily I asked a nurse I knew,
if not, we would have been in trouble.

591
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:49,978
Thank you.

592
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,983
Although it's hard, you understand me.

593
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,660
Please don't say that,
I'm actually sorry.

594
00:45:58,041 --> 00:46:03,271
Even though I know how Ahjussi
got to this step...

595
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:08,393
I was like a child, and only wanted
you to look at me, and throwing a tantrum.

596
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:17,156
What I really wanted,
wasn't Soul Furniture, a house, or assets,

597
00:46:17,769 --> 00:46:23,114
and even though I know that damning Ah Ran,
won't change my life at all.

598
00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:24,575
But...

599
00:46:25,442 --> 00:46:29,019
I just want to comfort my broken spirit.

600
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:34,251
To say, you did the right thing,
it wasn't you fault.

601
00:46:35,648 --> 00:46:37,362
If not...

602
00:46:37,482 --> 00:46:40,579
I'm afraid I won't have hope
to continue living.

603
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:43,627
Wait and see...

604
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:47,704
the days when the bandages are taken off
Ahjussi’s heart, those days will definitely come.

605
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:48,805
Oh, right.

606
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:52,551
What happened with the CCTV
that captured Ahjussi’s face?

607
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:01,237
I'm sorry,

608
00:47:01,357 --> 00:47:04,690
but could I take a look
at the CCTV I saw yesterday?

609
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:26,086
That's right.

610
00:47:26,678 --> 00:47:29,874
Shin Hyun Woo and Ahn Jae
Sung are two different people.

611
00:47:30,742 --> 00:47:33,652
No matter how god-like
Shin Hyun Woo's hands are,

612
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:37,377
he can't create a person who
breathes and walks.

613
00:48:25,918 --> 00:48:27,505
Ah Ran, it's me.

614
00:48:30,024 --> 00:48:31,421
Right now?

615
00:48:33,351 --> 00:48:35,298
Is it really alright?

616
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:37,182
We aren't even married yet...

617
00:48:37,302 --> 00:48:41,203
transferring all the assets under
your name to mine, will make you uneasy.

618
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,526
If you're not happy, let's not do it.

619
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:46,161
No.

620
00:48:46,987 --> 00:48:48,722
If we don't do this...

621
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:52,320
all of Soul's assets will
be stolen away by my in-laws.

622
00:48:53,293 --> 00:48:56,139
You don't know how greedy my
father-in-law is.

623
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:57,705
Then, in that case...

624
00:48:57,825 --> 00:49:01,091
transferring the ownership of Pyeong Chang Dong,
and all of your brother-in-law's showrooms too,

625
00:49:01,211 --> 00:49:03,102
isn't that a little too much?

626
00:49:03,222 --> 00:49:07,535
No matter what, you used to be a family too.

627
00:49:09,207 --> 00:49:10,688
Those people...

628
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,503
don't have the right to enjoy those assets.

629
00:49:13,623 --> 00:49:16,339
Sucking people's blood
dry in order to get that wealth,

630
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:19,548
of course they have to lose it this way.

631
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:22,003
Alright.

632
00:49:22,123 --> 00:49:23,231
Then...

633
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:25,347
the stock that I received from
President Joo,

634
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,882
I'll give to President Ahn.

635
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:29,765
You've even transferred SM Furniture,

636
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:32,326
what use is there if I keep it?

637
00:49:34,252 --> 00:49:36,241
Thank you, Julie Jung.

638
00:49:36,361 --> 00:49:38,474
What's there to be thankful for?

639
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:42,241
Just treat it as compensation
for my brother Sang Mo's crimes.

640
00:49:42,361 --> 00:49:44,866
Lawyer Lee,
the transfer documents,

641
00:49:44,986 --> 00:49:47,664
please don't make any mistakes,
and handle it detailed.

642
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:48,701
Yes.

643
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:50,077
For documents of these standard,

644
00:49:50,197 --> 00:49:53,018
even if President Shin Woo Sub
files a lawsuit,

645
00:49:53,138 --> 00:49:55,029
there will be no problem legally.

646
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:07,331
<i>Is Ah Ran really Joo Chul Ming's daughter?</i>

647
00:50:08,164 --> 00:50:10,704
<i>If she's that person's daughter,</i>

648
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:13,159
<i>what else could she know?</i>

649
00:50:13,518 --> 00:50:17,053
<i>If she knew everything,
and married into our family...</i>

650
00:51:05,316 --> 00:51:07,898
<i>That's a really happy family photo isn't it?</i>

651
00:51:09,824 --> 00:51:11,093
You...

652
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,365
You...

653
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:21,344
That happiness,
who destroyed it?

654
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:24,246
Who is the person who killed Mum and Dad?

655
00:51:24,366 --> 00:51:25,876
Was it Father-in-law?

656
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:30,257
Of course Mother-in-law
wouldn't know either.

657
00:51:30,377 --> 00:51:32,013
All...

658
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:34,592
Do you know all of it?

659
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:36,730
Is that why you got close to our Hyun Woo?

660
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,550
- Is that so?
- That's right.

661
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,010
That was the case.

662
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,211
Then,
for the death of your parents...

663
00:51:42,331 --> 00:51:43,992
you caused the death of our Hyun Woo?

664
00:51:44,112 --> 00:51:47,040
The traffic accident,
the fire at the villa, was that all planned?

665
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,897
At first, I didn't plan to kill Hyun Woo...

666
00:51:50,017 --> 00:51:52,648
but, I couldn't die because of Hyun Woo.

667
00:51:53,177 --> 00:51:55,063
Hyun Woo dug his own grave.

668
00:51:55,183 --> 00:51:57,454
If you hated us,
you should have killed us...

669
00:51:57,574 --> 00:51:59,063
why did you touch my son?!

670
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:02,068
Because, I wanted to take away
what was most precious to your family.

671
00:52:04,518 --> 00:52:06,741
You want me to find your sister, right?

672
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:07,989
Alright.

673
00:52:08,434 --> 00:52:10,444
Then, bring my son first.

674
00:52:12,709 --> 00:52:14,952
Don't bargain with my sister.

675
00:52:16,513 --> 00:52:18,481
She's a poor child who doesn't
know anything.

676
00:52:21,169 --> 00:52:23,179
Where's my sister?

677
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:27,096
If you have a shred of conscience,
give me my sister.

678
00:52:27,216 --> 00:52:29,826
Before you find my son,
don't even think about getting anything!

679
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:33,530
<i>Now, I'll go to the police station, and tell them
you're the real culprit of the traffic accident.</i>

680
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,140
Then, find our Hyun Woo.

681
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,474
As long as you get your retribution,
I'll take my own payback!

682
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,554
No!

683
00:53:00,846 --> 00:53:01,946
No!

684
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,108
I'm about to leave with Jae Sung.

685
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:06,457
I can't be caught by the police.

686
00:53:09,928 --> 00:53:12,277
It's me, Joo Seung.
Something big has happened.

687
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,265
Persuade Mother,
Mother is on her way to the police station,

688
00:53:15,385 --> 00:53:18,291
she says she wants to tell them everything
about the traffic accident and the arson!

689
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:19,561
What?!

690
00:53:19,681 --> 00:53:22,714
I just want to be happy with you now.

691
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:24,353
In order to get happiness for Dad and Mum,

692
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:27,781
I can't even live,
expressing my love for you.

693
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:31,929
Now, happiness is right in front of us,
we can't give up halfway.

694
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:33,861
Didn't I promise you?

695
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:38,093
I'll protect you till the end,
and give you happiness.

696
00:53:39,427 --> 00:53:41,691
I'll meet Madam.

697
00:53:42,263 --> 00:53:43,892
You wait.

698
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:33,123
If you're trying to help Ah Ran,
go back.

699
00:54:33,567 --> 00:54:36,022
I don't want to hear anything.

700
00:54:42,336 --> 00:54:43,951
What are you doing right now?

701
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:45,743
Get up immediately.

702
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:48,438
Although you've never treated me like a son,

703
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:51,464
this is the first time,
and the last time,

704
00:54:51,584 --> 00:54:53,517
I'm begging you as a son.

705
00:54:53,637 --> 00:54:57,369
Ah Ran's crimes,
help me cover them.

706
00:54:57,835 --> 00:54:58,915
I can't do that.

707
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:01,349
It's not because of Ah Ran,

708
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:03,593
at least once in my life,

709
00:55:03,713 --> 00:55:06,852
I could be Madam's son
Just once!

710
00:55:07,741 --> 00:55:09,267
For me...

711
00:55:09,817 --> 00:55:11,383
Hyun Woos' grievances,

712
00:55:11,503 --> 00:55:13,860
you could keep an eye shut.

713
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:16,442
For the son that was born illegitimately...

714
00:55:16,562 --> 00:55:18,389
is that a request that's too much too?

715
00:55:18,509 --> 00:55:20,639
This is not a crime that can be covered up.

716
00:55:21,507 --> 00:55:23,940
If we don't investigate Ah Ran's crimes...

717
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,073
Hyun Woo could never appear
in front of us again!

718
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:39,812
This photograph...

719
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:45,024
to me...

720
00:55:45,144 --> 00:55:47,436
is the only family photo I have.

721
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:50,780
Although Madam denies it,

722
00:55:52,754 --> 00:55:55,209
but to me,
you're my mother.

723
00:55:58,468 --> 00:55:59,590
I...

724
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:02,638
love AH Ran very much.

725
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:06,892
Even though the whole world
points and stares...

726
00:56:08,162 --> 00:56:12,987
the heart that loves Ah Ran,
is bright and true.

727
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:17,114
<i>Together with Ah Ran...</i>

728
00:56:17,706 --> 00:56:21,833
I want to build a new family,
and live together..

729
00:56:23,528 --> 00:56:26,004
with no empty spaces as parents,

730
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,200
I want to live with the woman I love.

731
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,996
Is that impossible?

732
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:38,366
Hyun Woo Hyung is alive.

733
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,372
He's not far away.

734
00:56:42,917 --> 00:56:44,102
I...

735
00:56:44,546 --> 00:56:46,959
will send him to Madam's side.

736
00:56:47,079 --> 00:56:49,545
I promise.

737
00:56:51,746 --> 00:56:53,904
Where's our Hyun Woo?

738
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:56,656
You know it?

739
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:27,454
Madam won't make things
hard for you anymore,

740
00:57:27,574 --> 00:57:29,359
don't worry.

741
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,179
Even if that's the case,
you're still her son.

742
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:34,428
Once her heart softens, she loses to you.

743
00:57:34,766 --> 00:57:36,665
I only got you some time temporarily.

744
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:39,961
There are no secrets forever.

745
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:42,648
Let's go to a new country
and forget the past,

746
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:44,849
start anew.

747
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:48,158
Just like we've never been hurt before,

748
00:57:48,898 --> 00:57:53,237
and then,
fall in love all over again.

749
00:58:04,276 --> 00:58:05,609
<i>Joo Seung.</i>

750
00:58:06,138 --> 00:58:14,170
<i>There isn't much time left
to spend with Joo Seung either.</i>

751
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:21,948
<i>Joo Seung, for loving such
a woman like me, thank you.</i>

752
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:25,887
<i>I will occasionally think about you.</i>

753
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,190
What are you doing?

754
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,711
It's so dark,
yet you don't turn on the lights.

755
00:58:55,831 --> 00:58:57,235
Mum, you put up the Christmas tree so early?

756
00:58:57,355 --> 00:58:58,631
Honey...

757
00:58:59,414 --> 00:59:01,192
our Hyun Woo was here.

758
00:59:01,312 --> 00:59:03,108
It must be our Hyun Woo.

759
00:59:03,228 --> 00:59:06,451
Look at the paper doll,
that's Hyun Woo's art.

760
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:08,928
Is it real?

761
00:59:09,499 --> 00:59:13,403
This tree,
did Hyun Woo Oppa make it before leaving?

762
00:59:13,523 --> 00:59:14,525
Yes.

763
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:18,630
Oppa is still alive, and is thinking of us,
that's why he came secretly.

764
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,472
He hasn't forgotten us.

765
00:59:20,592 --> 00:59:22,880
Hyun Woo, this kid.

766
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,466
He's clearly by our side,
yet he's not returning.

767
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:31,191
It must be for something serious.

768
01:00:01,744 --> 01:00:03,840
President, something big has happened.

769
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,427
<i>What is it?</i>

770
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:07,878
According to your instructions, we
inspected the showrooms of your daughter-in-law.

771
01:00:07,998 --> 01:00:10,523
We found these documents.

772
01:00:14,381 --> 01:00:15,693
What is this?

773
01:00:16,624 --> 01:00:19,354
The transfer documents for Soul Furniture.

774
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:23,397
Who's transferring Soul Furniture?!

775
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:25,630
<i>Hyun Woo's stocks,</i>

776
01:00:26,435 --> 01:00:28,615
and the house at Pyeong Chang Dong,

777
01:00:28,735 --> 01:00:31,048
and Hyun Min's showrooms.

778
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:33,969
How can that be?!

779
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:41,156
What is it?

780
01:00:42,913 --> 01:00:47,137
Maybe Father-in-law knows that
I've transferred my assets over to Jae Sung.

781
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,206
Looks like...

782
01:00:50,925 --> 01:00:53,317
I'll have to stay here tonight.

783
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:56,928
Let's just do that.

784
01:00:57,048 --> 01:01:00,780
If possible,
you can stay here before the wedding.

785
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,981
Really?

786
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:07,087
Anyway, I don't have to go to
the company anymore...

787
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:09,853
so I'll just stay here,
and prepare for the wedding.

788
01:01:11,821 --> 01:01:12,879
But...

789
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:16,012
when are your parents and
siblings coming from America?

790
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,086
The wedding is tomorrow.

791
01:01:18,785 --> 01:01:21,430
On the day of the wedding,
I think they'll go straight to the church.

792
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,245
They don't seem t be very free,
because of their work.

793
01:01:24,365 --> 01:01:27,610
So, they can only greet you in the church.

794
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,281
<i>What a miracle.</i>

795
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:39,796
If people say the same thing with
the same mouth,

796
01:01:39,916 --> 01:01:41,913
it might come true.

797
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:45,921
Who knew I would live in America.

798
01:01:46,725 --> 01:01:49,223
I'm so touched...

799
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:52,059
and I'm anticipating,
our new married life.

800
01:02:21,377 --> 01:02:23,261
Jae Sung really...

801
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:26,520
When did he put this here?

802
01:02:34,253 --> 01:02:36,518
<i>The Juliet that steals heart.</i>

803
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:39,134
<i>You're leaving without even seeing me?</i>

804
01:02:39,494 --> 01:02:40,785
<i>Wait a little longer.</i>

805
01:02:40,905 --> 01:02:43,028
<i>We'll meet again.</i>

806
01:02:43,324 --> 01:02:46,816
<i>I really want to see how
you look in a wedding dress.</i>

807
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:08,039
It clearly says...

808
01:03:08,612 --> 01:03:11,533
the only I crime I have,
is that I tried very hard to run the company.

809
01:03:13,014 --> 01:03:14,707
I'm sorry that things turned out this way.

810
01:03:14,827 --> 01:03:16,379
Don't lie.

811
01:03:17,416 --> 01:03:21,602
The two of you planned
to take over the company, right?

812
01:03:22,364 --> 01:03:24,205
<i>You're looking at the wrong person.</i>

813
01:03:24,325 --> 01:03:26,597
Is that how you do business?

814
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,216
You use the resort as an excuse
to get closer,

815
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:32,947
and what have you prepared for this thing?

816
01:03:33,067 --> 01:03:37,201
I, only used legitimate methods
to take over Soul and the house.

817
01:03:40,213 --> 01:03:41,012
Here

818
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:44,065
These are the details of my
investment in Soul.

819
01:03:49,229 --> 01:03:51,028
This is ridiculous.

820
01:03:51,148 --> 01:03:54,695
Toads,
also go toward the light.

821
01:03:54,815 --> 01:03:56,939
How could you take the entirety
of someone else's assets,

822
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:59,119
and take it over in one morning?

823
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,410
<i>Return me my company!</i>

824
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:02,722
<i>I can never give you my company.</i>

825
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:08,648
Before my son comes back,
he has to die in that house!

826
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:10,732
<i>Dad, are you alright?</i>

827
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:12,912
<i>Dad, calm down!</i>

828
01:04:16,237 --> 01:04:19,115
You should send him to the hospital.

829
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,452
As your request...

830
01:04:29,214 --> 01:04:32,452
if you want to leave with Joo Seung,
do that.

831
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:35,859
What a charitable act.

832
01:04:37,459 --> 01:04:38,835
But...

833
01:04:39,851 --> 01:04:42,708
give the house,
and Hyun Min's showrooms back to us.

834
01:04:44,337 --> 01:04:45,607
No.

835
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:49,582
The house, the company,
the showrooms...

836
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:52,524
I can't return you a single one.

837
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:57,477
A family built on blood, will
end with blood.

838
01:04:58,322 --> 01:05:00,883
The crime of trampling on our
family for money...

839
01:05:01,179 --> 01:05:03,465
you have to pay it back with money.

840
01:05:03,585 --> 01:05:05,604
<i>That's fair, don't you think?</i>

841
01:05:06,124 --> 01:05:09,115
Do you know what it is like,
living on the streets because we had no money,

842
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:11,650
that lonely and pathetic life?!

843
01:05:12,730 --> 01:05:15,037
It cuts to the bone, doesn't it.

844
01:05:24,106 --> 01:05:26,448
If you hand over our Kyeong Ran...

845
01:05:26,935 --> 01:05:29,623
I might consider returning you the house.

846
01:05:43,503 --> 01:05:47,101
<i>The Shin Woo Sub who only
graduated from elementary school,</i>

847
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:49,774
<i>fought for money to buy this house.</i>

848
01:05:49,894 --> 01:05:53,541
<i>Dad, after I'm married, I want to
stay with my wife and children in this house.</i>

849
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:57,435
<i>How can that be?
I want to stay here with my children too!</i>

850
01:05:57,555 --> 01:05:59,847
<i>Then, isn't it alright if we
all stay together?</i>

851
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:01,964
<i>Should we build another floor?</i>

852
01:06:12,156 --> 01:06:13,511
Director.

853
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,691
I'm Hyun Woo's mother.

854
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:17,362
Kyeong Ran...

855
01:06:18,353 --> 01:06:19,941
No,
Jae Hee...

856
01:06:21,126 --> 01:06:23,073
Her sister wants to see her.

857
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:25,380
Can you contact her for me?

858
01:06:39,335 --> 01:06:40,605
Hello.

859
01:06:41,007 --> 01:06:41,980
Mother.

860
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,203
Hello,

861
01:06:44,323 --> 01:06:45,536
this is...

862
01:06:46,434 --> 01:06:47,746
Mother..

863
01:06:48,678 --> 01:06:50,053
I'm Hyun Woo.

864
01:06:53,736 --> 01:06:55,090
Hyun Woo?

865
01:06:55,789 --> 01:06:57,715
Are you really Hyun Woo?

866
01:06:58,804 --> 01:06:59,904
Yes, Mother.

867
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,290
It's Hyun Woo.

873
01:07:14,206 --> 01:07:16,329
<i>In the end, you want to kill me right?</i>

874
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,980
<i>If the law,
the world is all on Father-in-law's side,</i>

875
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,655
<i>I will trample this world.</i>

876
01:07:19,775 --> 01:07:22,089
<i>I'm so happy, yet I keep shedding tears.</i>

877
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:24,079
I'm so in love with you.

878
01:07:24,199 --> 01:07:27,317
What kind of betrayal that was,
I will let you feel it in your bones.

879
01:07:27,437 --> 01:07:28,875
<i>Marrying Joo Ah Ran,</i>

880
01:07:28,995 --> 01:07:30,360
<i>does that make sense?</i>

881
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,387
<i>Is that what Ah Ran really is?</i>

882
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:34,420
Where is Shin Hyun Woo!

883
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,736
Come out immediately!

884
01:07:35,856 --> 01:07:38,179
Don't meddle in other people's business.
Don't show your face again!

885
01:07:38,299 --> 01:07:40,930
Joo Ah Ran,
did you really kill Shin Hyun Woo?

886
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:42,645
It's all a lie!

Final Episode 21

3
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:07,113
President, you don't know, right?

4
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:09,812
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,

5
00:00:09,932 --> 00:00:11,174
is Madam.

6
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:13,325
What?

7
00:00:13,445 --> 00:00:15,719
Is this fellow crazy?

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,015
You don't know that Madam was the one
who tampered with the wheels, right?

9
00:00:20,135 --> 00:00:22,400
The person who killed Ah Ran's parents,

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,179
<i>and the person who plunged
the sisters into tragedy,</i>

11
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,928
was Madam!

12
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:29,632
<i>What are you saying?</i>

13
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:31,811
No matter how much you hate your mother,

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,689
you can't spout nonsense like that.

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,563
If you doubt me, ask Madam directly.

16
00:00:39,013 --> 00:00:41,361
Who was the person who
tampered with the wheels,

17
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:43,220
who was the person who
killed Ah Ran's parents,

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,500
tell him everything!

19
00:00:49,782 --> 00:00:51,246
Honey,

20
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:53,650
forgive me.

21
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:58,405
Then, it's true?

22
00:01:00,076 --> 00:01:01,588
How could you?!

23
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:03,297
It's not!

24
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:07,382
The person who brutally trampled
on Ah Ran's entire family...

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,710
was Madam.

26
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,081
Up till now,

27
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:15,372
can President's family point fingers
at Ah Ran and blame her?

28
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,607
Hyun Woo is still alive,

29
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:19,316
but Ah Ran's parents are dead,

30
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:21,857
who should be punished?

31
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:23,303
Do you not feel shame?

32
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,913
All the guilt is mine,

33
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,767
why are you blaming Hyun Woo?

34
00:01:28,887 --> 00:01:30,608
It doesn't matter if it was
the traffic accident,

35
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:31,790
or setting fire to burn him to death,

36
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,556
from the beginning you should
have tried to kill me.

37
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,997
It's not too late yet!

38
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,024
If dying is your wish,

39
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:46,627
I'll grant it.

40
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,700
- Ah Ran.
- You want to die?

41
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:52,989
What are you waiting for?

42
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,655
My father and my mother are waiting for you!

43
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:57,589
Ah Ran, wait a while.

44
00:01:57,709 --> 00:01:59,505
Let go!

45
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,158
Hurry in.

46
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:33,680
I've talked to Joo Ah Ran,

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,234
she doesn't seem to have any intention
of extending the invoice period.

48
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:37,454
What should we do?

49
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,493
By the end of business hours today,
you'll officially be declared bankrupt.

50
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:43,070
Don't worry too much.

51
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,093
I've already made preparations
for the official declaration.

52
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:46,800
What?

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,305
I've separated Soul and SM.

54
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:55,042
Soul was originally a wedding present to
Joo Ah Ran when we got married.

55
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:59,380
Now, I am going over with
no regrets to SM Furniture.

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,469
Then, if Soul Furniture goes bankrupt,
will there be no impact on SM Furniture?

57
00:03:04,589 --> 00:03:06,932
It's difficult right now because
there is no capital,

58
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:11,062
but I just have to act like the beginning,
gritting my teeth and running a little more.

59
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:13,541
Compared to this,

60
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:15,889
I have something to tell you Jae Hee.

61
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,528
I can't believe this.

62
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:21,565
{\a6}Last Episode

63
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:22,341
<i>The person who has been
sponsoring me all this time,</i>

64
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:26,661
is the person who killed my parents.

65
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:28,708
Then,

66
00:03:28,828 --> 00:03:31,168
with my parents' lives,

67
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:33,178
I traded it for clothes,

68
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:35,216
presents,

69
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:37,713
and even college?
Is that right?

70
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,601
Don't feel burdened,

71
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:45,265
to Mother, it was some kind of redemption.

72
00:03:46,072 --> 00:03:48,101
Why was she so cruel?

73
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:52,044
She didn't have to kill someone innocent.

74
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:56,784
Maybe she was afraid her
secret would be exposed,

75
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,775
and lost her mind.

76
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:03,866
If only she was calmer and more rational,

77
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:06,101
things would have been better.

78
00:04:12,648 --> 00:04:14,113
Yes, Father.

79
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:17,137
What?

80
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,063
Do you know where this place is?

81
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,028
Because of you, my parents didn't
even know why they died.

82
00:04:40,148 --> 00:04:42,338
This is my parents' grave!

83
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,979
In this cold water,

84
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:50,246
only the ashes of my parents are left.

85
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,443
What do you have to say?

86
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:59,626
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:00,621
I will apologize.

88
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,246
If you want me to die, I'll die.

89
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:06,144
Apologize?

90
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,193
What's the use of an apology?!

91
00:05:09,653 --> 00:05:12,114
Can my dead parents come back?

92
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:15,456
Can my tragic life be changed?

93
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,229
<i>Because of you, I became a lunatic,</i>

94
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:24,210
I became a criminal that
tried to kill my husband.

95
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,440
All of this, how are you going to repay me?

96
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,815
Follow me.

97
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,335
Ah... Ah Ran.

98
00:05:58,087 --> 00:05:59,457
It's me.

99
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,509
Where are you right now?

100
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:02,011
I'll go there.

101
00:06:02,131 --> 00:06:03,157
<i>Forget it.</i>

102
00:06:03,277 --> 00:06:05,796
<i>I don't need your help anymore.</i>

103
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:09,495
<i>The person who should have died
wasn't Shin Hyun Woo, but Jo Kyung Hee.</i>

104
00:06:09,615 --> 00:06:10,491
No...

105
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,805
Ah Ran!

106
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:13,777
You can't, Ah Ran!

107
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:38,698
I've found out the location of the taxi that
Ah Ran is taking by the car plate number.

108
00:06:39,205 --> 00:06:41,740
It's better if you go look there,

109
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,914
I have a bad feeling.

110
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:47,061
Yeo Ju.

111
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,146
If it's Yeo Ju...

112
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:53,352
It's the wooden lodge where she held me!

113
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:03,072
You said you wanted to
die to apologize, right?

114
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:07,321
Then just die in front of me.

115
00:07:08,824 --> 00:07:11,302
All this is already out in the open,

116
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:15,152
there is no other choice for you.

117
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:29,058
Do you want to pour it yourself,
or should I do it for you?

118
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,259
Ah Ran.

119
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:32,156
Why?

120
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:35,123
Are you afraid of dying?

121
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,255
I know you hate me,

122
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:48,428
but I still want to apologize to you.

123
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,797
Because of a criminal like me,

124
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,863
stop doing things that destroy your life.

125
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,797
If you want,

126
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:58,896
I will die quietly by myself.

127
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:02,361
Stop pretending to be pathetic.

128
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,779
Do you think I'll let you off this way?

129
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:10,758
There's nothing else to destroy
or abandon in my life.

130
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:15,584
Traffic accident, murder charges,
running away, arson,

131
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,631
ten fingers are not enough.

132
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,500
Someone like me,

133
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,012
even if I kill the people
who killed my parents,

134
00:08:25,132 --> 00:08:27,547
is not enough for me.

135
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,231
Alright.

136
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:44,067
Let's die.

137
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:48,630
There's nothing else to hold on to,
or to cling on to.

138
00:08:49,825 --> 00:08:53,844
Life, if we suffer through our life,
it's hell.

139
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,365
Now...

140
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,440
I want to shed this burden too.

141
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,754
When you die and meet my parents,

142
00:09:33,677 --> 00:09:35,950
you have to kneel and beg
for their forgiveness.

143
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:39,067
When they forgive you,

144
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,799
I'll offer a cup of wine at your tombstone.

145
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:25,821
Joo Ah Ran, stop!

146
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:28,256
Don't come over!

147
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:30,847
If you come over, your mother will die.

148
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:36,671
What is this?

149
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,268
The crimes that you've
committed aren't enough,

150
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,146
what else do you want to do?!

151
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,549
Kyeong Ran, you stay out of this.

152
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:45,706
My hands are soiled,

153
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:48,091
I'll end this by myself.

154
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:51,396
<i>Don't watch anything.</i>

155
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:53,734
Just pretend you don't
know anything forever.

156
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,439
Please listen to me and stop.

157
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,345
I'll stop pursuing everything
that you've done to me.

158
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:02,101
I haven't handed the evidence to the police.

159
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:04,918
It doesn't matter if you do!

160
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:08,017
Now, I've met the real culprit.

161
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,512
<i>You've suffered so much too,</i>

162
00:11:12,113 --> 00:11:15,136
now, you should let your
mother suffer it too!

163
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,534
What...

164
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,295
What are you doing now?

165
00:11:37,206 --> 00:11:38,427
I,

166
00:11:39,424 --> 00:11:41,265
don't have a mother,

167
00:11:41,385 --> 00:11:43,330
or a father.

168
00:11:44,025 --> 00:11:47,537
I've missed my family so
much all this while.

169
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,472
<i>It's been so hard to find my sister.</i>

170
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:57,989
I don't want to send you to
prison and leave me alone.

171
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,138
If something happens to Madam,

172
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,706
you'll never return to being my Unni.

173
00:12:07,382 --> 00:12:10,180
If you still want to light the fire,
light it.

174
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,769
Here...

175
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,826
I'll die with Madam.

176
00:12:54,242 --> 00:12:55,613
You can't,

177
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,374
you can't... my poor parents.

178
00:13:00,176 --> 00:13:03,256
What will happen to my poor parents?!

179
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,351
I put it on you because the smell
of the gasoline is too choking.

180
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:48,622
Why do you do something
like that so casually?

181
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,491
Did you endure it for me?

182
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:57,207
I said we would die together,

183
00:13:57,733 --> 00:13:59,704
you got scared, right?

184
00:14:01,545 --> 00:14:04,418
What does it matter to me if you died?

185
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:07,462
I just didn't have the courage.

186
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,997
Actually, I...

187
00:14:11,255 --> 00:14:13,452
have something to tell you.

188
00:14:15,017 --> 00:14:18,040
When I found out you were my Unni,

189
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:21,383
I prayed to the Heavens.

190
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:25,777
I don't need an Unni like that,

191
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,901
quickly take her away.

192
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:35,197
<i>I was afraid to break up with Hyun Woo,</i>

193
00:14:36,479 --> 00:14:39,615
that's why I had such frightening thoughts.

194
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,446
I'm really...

195
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,374
horrible, right?

196
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,815
I have something to confess too.

197
00:14:57,942 --> 00:15:00,797
When our parents died,

198
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:05,269
it was the day Dad was supposed
to go away for business.

199
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:11,297
But I wanted a birthday celebration,

200
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:15,834
so I was throwing a tantrum.

201
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,933
To have dinner together,

202
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,275
to buy presents together.

203
00:15:23,744 --> 00:15:26,674
If Dad had gone away like
he was supposed to,

204
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,894
they wouldn't have died like that.

205
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:38,516
I'm afraid to say it's my fault,

206
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,211
that's why I push the blame
on other people more,

207
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,031
that might be the case.

208
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:07,815
What's the reason you demanded to be
let out of the hospital so quickly?

209
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,881
Where did Mum go?

210
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,261
Did Mum... get into trouble again?

211
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,458
Don't blame your mother.

212
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,940
When she comes home,

213
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,193
don't say anything,
and treat her with warmth.

214
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:25,414
<i>Horrible person.</i>

215
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:29,589
<i>She must have endured so
much pain for so many years.</i>

216
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:34,133
<i>If I had told her I knew about her
relationship with Secretary Nam,</i>

217
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:37,479
<i>all this tragedy wouldn't have happened.</i>

218
00:16:38,268 --> 00:16:40,559
<i>All this is my fault.</i>

219
00:16:41,498 --> 00:16:43,113
Mum!

220
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,483
Father, what's going on?

221
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:47,948
Did you get discharged?

222
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:51,670
I won't be able to walk even
if I stay in the hospital.

223
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:55,069
I got a lot of painkillers, don't worry.

224
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:57,135
Is your Mum alright?

225
00:16:58,741 --> 00:16:59,906
Yes.

226
00:17:00,026 --> 00:17:02,741
Joo Ah Ran was taken away by Jae Hee.

227
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,624
But...

228
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:05,314
But what is this smell?

229
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:07,380
Isn't it gasoline?

230
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,201
You said you were with Joo Ah Ran,

231
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,849
could she have poured gasoline on Mum?

232
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,253
No!

233
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,713
I'm going in to shower.

234
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,558
Is Oppa a fool?

235
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,169
You risked your life to undergo
full-body plastic surgery,

236
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:30,342
but where's the Oppa that wanted
to take revenge on Joo Ah Ran?

237
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:41,312
If Oppa can't do it, I will.

238
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,735
I won't let that woman,

239
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,556
Joo Ah Ran, go!

240
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:33,325
Are you looking at the photographs?

241
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,071
That was when I was younger,

242
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,437
I was quite ugly, right?

243
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:43,495
If our parents were alive,

244
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:47,119
you wouldn't be living like that either.

245
00:18:49,448 --> 00:18:51,438
When you went to school,

246
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,604
did anyone tease you for being
from an orphanage?

247
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:56,237
So what if I did?

248
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:58,979
It was just because they didn't know better,

249
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:01,289
I was fine with it.

250
00:19:02,105 --> 00:19:04,396
You don't need to lie to me.

251
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:08,134
<i>What is an orphan,</i>

252
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,293
what is poverty,

253
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:13,617
I've felt it in my bones too.

254
00:19:15,273 --> 00:19:16,982
What you see might not be true.

255
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:20,400
Orphans and people in poverty
don't have to live unhappy.

256
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:25,454
Because they have dreams,
tomorrow might be a happier day.

257
00:19:25,811 --> 00:19:29,642
Compared to this, Madam's life is hell.

258
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:31,697
Thinking about the way she lived,

259
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,243
she's already made her repentance,

260
00:19:34,363 --> 00:19:35,452
let's just forget it.

261
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,556
How can we forget it?

262
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,406
25 years turns her into an innocent victim,

263
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,658
but makes me a cold-blooded murderer.

264
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:47,513
What in the world do I have to forget,

265
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:49,203
or to forgive?

266
00:20:07,577 --> 00:20:09,173
<i>[Madam]</i>

267
00:20:11,861 --> 00:20:14,904
<i>The person who gave birth to you was Mum,</i>

268
00:20:15,617 --> 00:20:18,134
<i>the person you hate is also Mother!</i>

269
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:21,946
<i>You feel it's right to personally send the
person who gave birth to you to her death?</i>

270
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,566
What do you plan to do with Joo Ah Ran?

271
00:20:28,354 --> 00:20:32,148
I don't know what would be
the right call to make either.

272
00:20:33,873 --> 00:20:36,258
To you and Hyun Woo,

273
00:20:36,972 --> 00:20:39,819
even though this might sound ridiculous,

274
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,169
but could we absolve her crimes legally?

275
00:20:43,665 --> 00:20:45,092
Because,

276
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:47,177
Ah Ran has lost a lot too.

277
00:20:47,297 --> 00:20:49,280
I share the same thoughts as your mother,

278
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,886
because if your mother is
a criminal, so am I.

279
00:20:53,006 --> 00:20:55,806
If Ah Ran comes to any trouble,
our family won't be free either.

280
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:57,815
Sending Ah Ran to jail,

281
00:20:57,935 --> 00:21:00,219
you won't feel comfortable either.

282
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:05,036
Then, I'll become the real culprit
of the traffic accident.

283
00:21:05,156 --> 00:21:07,327
If they find out that Joo Ah Ran
is the driver,

284
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:10,276
then she'll be convicted for running away.

285
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:13,030
Just take it that you're
repenting for the crime

286
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,265
that your mother committed 25 years ago.

287
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:16,767
Prepare yourself,

288
00:21:16,887 --> 00:21:18,382
please.

289
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:40,456
You grew up beautifully.

290
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,026
I really wanted to...

291
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,890
do everything for you like a mother.

292
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:55,901
But after we've really met,
I can't do anything for you.

293
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:01,572
Like you said,

294
00:22:04,453 --> 00:22:06,744
were my methods wrong?

295
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:16,553
The two of us are living such tiring lives,

296
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:22,713
why can't I have the same thoughts as you?

297
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,387
<i>I'm sorry Unni.</i>

298
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,279
<i>Tiring Unni out like that,</i>

299
00:22:32,443 --> 00:22:34,922
<i>from loving Shin Hyun Woo,</i>

300
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:39,548
<i>and Unni loving Ahn Jae Sung,</i>

301
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:45,651
<i>our parents wouldn't want to see
the way we take revenge too.</i>

302
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:55,741
Hyun Ji!

303
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:57,678
Did you see the flashdrive in my room?

304
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:00,025
I left it on my bed.

305
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:01,565
I didn't see it.

306
00:23:01,685 --> 00:23:02,711
What is it?

307
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:06,316
Ah, it's really important,
where did I drop it?

308
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,167
Ah Ran...

309
00:23:16,969 --> 00:23:19,730
we've decided to accept her.

310
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:24,258
If there's a need,
we'll write her a recognition letter.

311
00:23:24,378 --> 00:23:26,042
No matter what,

312
00:23:26,162 --> 00:23:28,690
help her to forget the past
and start afresh.

313
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:31,799
Hyun Woo Hyung,

314
00:23:32,268 --> 00:23:33,789
has agreed too?

315
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:35,048
Of course.

316
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,996
Hyun Woo's father feels the same way too.

317
00:23:38,822 --> 00:23:40,869
If there's time,

318
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:45,875
can you go somewhere with me?

319
00:24:00,135 --> 00:24:02,389
Joo Seung's father,

320
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,998
it's been a long time.

321
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,112
I never thought there would be a day,

322
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:14,319
where Joo Seung and I will come
and see you together.

323
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:19,974
The day you died,

324
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:24,237
I stayed outside your hospital
door and never came in,

325
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:26,660
<i>you can understand, right?</i>

326
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,197
My cowardice,

327
00:24:31,317 --> 00:24:33,882
please forgive it.

328
00:24:35,385 --> 00:24:38,408
The life that was supposed
to end a long time ago,

329
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,700
because of you,

330
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,405
I lived a long time.

331
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:53,868
Thank you.

332
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,940
- Let's go.
- Joo Seung.

333
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,008
Just once...

334
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:29,059
Could you call me Mother?

335
00:25:32,629 --> 00:25:35,540
From the beginning, I never had a mother.

336
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:38,732
In the future as well.

337
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:10,749
<i>Joo Ah Ran.</i>

338
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:13,256
<i>Even if everyone in our family forgives you,</i>

339
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,604
<i>I'll never be able to.</i>

340
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:17,876
<i>Everything that you did to our family,</i>

341
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:20,411
<i>I want you to pay it back one by one.</i>

342
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:25,913
It's the police.

343
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,349
What are you doing right now?

344
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:35,678
Where is Joo Ah Ran?

345
00:26:36,617 --> 00:26:38,025
I don't know.

346
00:26:38,145 --> 00:26:39,765
From the black box and the fingerprints
that Shin Hyun Woo provided,

347
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:42,226
we've come to a conclusion.

348
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:46,499
The traffic accident at Chang Yuan,
and the arson at Yang Pyeong,

349
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:48,865
the suspect is Joo Ah Ran.

350
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:52,057
Shin Hyun Woo.

351
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:54,985
The person who reported
it was Shin Hyun Woo?

352
00:26:59,682 --> 00:27:01,692
This is the spinach I made,

353
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:04,189
I'm good at cooking.

354
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,006
Try the fish soup too.

355
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,509
I was really determined,

356
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:11,583
and went to the market to buy a big fish.

357
00:27:14,177 --> 00:27:16,900
Wretch, why are you showing off?

358
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:20,881
You think no one else can do it?

359
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:23,041
At Aunt's house,

360
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:27,370
I made food till I had calluses on my hands.

361
00:27:30,996 --> 00:27:34,039
After we eat,

362
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,043
shall we shower together?

363
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:39,334
I shower by myself every day,

364
00:27:39,454 --> 00:27:42,179
no one scrubs my back for me.

365
00:27:45,391 --> 00:27:47,062
Where are you going?

366
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:49,485
If you don't want to, it's fine too.

367
00:27:49,605 --> 00:27:51,848
Are you in a bad mood?

368
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:53,951
Didn't you want to shower?

369
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:55,998
We have to fill the tub.

370
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,702
What's wrong?

371
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:12,563
Are you crying?

372
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:15,117
Who's crying?

373
00:28:15,237 --> 00:28:16,995
It's just tiring.

374
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,216
Don't save money,

375
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,723
go to the spa to get your
back scrubbed sometimes.

376
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:32,099
I can do it for you when I'm around,

377
00:28:34,216 --> 00:28:37,671
but I don't know what will
happen in the future.

378
00:28:38,404 --> 00:28:40,225
Why are you saying that?

379
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:43,822
Hyun Woo said he won't pursue the past,

380
00:28:44,648 --> 00:28:47,239
everything will be alright from now on.

381
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,380
Don't think about those things.

382
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,541
<i>[Joo Seung]</i>

383
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:19,584
Ah Ran,

384
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:22,816
hurry pick up the phone!

385
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:25,596
The police are after you!

386
00:29:34,864 --> 00:29:36,029
Joo Seung, it's me.

387
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,357
Why are you not picking up your phone?

388
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,690
<i>Something big has happened.</i>

389
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,197
<i>Hurry and run away from there now.</i>

390
00:29:42,317 --> 00:29:45,052
Shin Hyun Woo has handed over the black box,

391
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:47,925
the police could be on their way!

392
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,836
I got it.

393
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:53,634
What happened?

394
00:29:53,754 --> 00:29:55,501
The police are after me.

395
00:29:55,621 --> 00:29:57,022
I have to go out.

396
00:29:57,142 --> 00:29:59,971
It's too dangerous by yourself,
I'll go with you.

397
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,961
Kyeong Ran, you stay here.

398
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:04,703
I don't want you to be tired
out because of me.

399
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:07,004
Where are you going to go?

400
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:08,093
That's right.

401
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,445
You can go to the Angel Orphanage.

402
00:30:11,462 --> 00:30:13,163
I'll call the Director,

403
00:30:13,283 --> 00:30:14,497
you can go hide there for
a day or two first.

404
00:30:14,617 --> 00:30:17,301
I'll clarify the situation
before calling you.

405
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:22,859
It's cold, you have to watch
out for your health.

406
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,057
Take a cab.

407
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,560
During this period of time, use my phone,

408
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,362
got it?

409
00:30:40,948 --> 00:30:42,450
Unni!

410
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,959
Unni,

411
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,657
you have to be fine.

412
00:30:58,777 --> 00:31:01,136
If something happens,

413
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:03,352
I will really hate you then.

414
00:31:07,941 --> 00:31:10,250
Kyeong Ran, so you're a crybaby,

415
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,260
how silly.

416
00:31:13,274 --> 00:31:15,978
Unni will come back soon,
why are you crying?

417
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,366
Unni will be back soon,

418
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,301
I promise.

419
00:31:39,786 --> 00:31:42,265
In order for things to happen this way,

420
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:44,856
did you try to give us some peace?

421
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:48,086
Is this the end of your revenge?

422
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,011
Like a hypocrite,

423
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,058
you only said the good things,

424
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,518
from beginning till end, you didn't
shed a drop of blood, or a tear,

425
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:56,415
and you're expecting Ah Ran to die?

426
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:58,161
It's a misunderstanding,

427
00:31:58,281 --> 00:32:00,214
I never handed the flashdrive over.

428
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:01,961
Then who did?

429
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:07,125
Besides the victim, who else is there?!

430
00:32:09,968 --> 00:32:12,654
Don't be agitated, let's think of a way.

431
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:16,485
Once the flashdrive's content is exposed,
everything Ah Ran did will be uncovered.

432
00:32:16,605 --> 00:32:19,583
Then, even when we write the letter,
nothing will be of use.

433
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:22,275
I have to make a trip to the police station.

434
00:32:27,064 --> 00:32:28,134
What?

435
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,699
Shin Hyun Ji?

436
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:32,858
Since we already have concrete evidence,

437
00:32:32,978 --> 00:32:34,811
we have to launch a formal investigation
against Joo Ah Ran.

438
00:32:34,931 --> 00:32:37,271
<i>The police are arresting her right now.</i>

439
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:39,337
I'm sorry,

440
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,082
but could you give Joo Ah Ran more time?

441
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:44,786
If the victim submits a letter that
he doesn't want to pursue charges,

442
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:45,819
what will happen?

443
00:32:45,939 --> 00:32:48,861
Although it can be used for
reference during the jury,

444
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:50,335
running away from the police,

445
00:32:50,455 --> 00:32:52,345
is something that cannot be pardoned.

446
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:01,259
I'm the main perpetrator!

447
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,320
Joo Ah Ran isn't guilty.

448
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,484
<i>Prison,</i>

449
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:07,268
<i>or the detention center,</i>

450
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:08,977
please just lock me up.

451
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:11,311
There was Joo Ah Ran's face
in the black box,

452
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:13,471
what are you talking about?

453
00:33:14,128 --> 00:33:15,630
It's not true.

454
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,377
Joo Ah Ran,

455
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:19,517
is only my helper.

456
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,297
I hate Shin Hyun Woo,

457
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,438
and told her to kill him.

458
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:28,438
<i>That woman was just persuaded by me,</i>

459
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:30,485
I'm the real murderer!

460
00:33:37,164 --> 00:33:38,798
What?!

461
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,014
Who wants to marry who?

462
00:33:41,134 --> 00:33:43,125
Father's health isn't good,

463
00:33:43,245 --> 00:33:45,603
and I know I shouldn't be saying this,

464
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,087
but, I want to hold a simple
wedding ceremony,

465
00:33:47,207 --> 00:33:49,472
with just our family.

466
00:33:51,092 --> 00:33:52,876
Please agree to it.

467
00:33:58,472 --> 00:34:00,707
Are you just informing us,

468
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:03,346
after you've set the wedding date?

469
00:34:03,646 --> 00:34:06,181
Oppa, are you crazy?

470
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:07,477
Hyun Min.

471
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:09,318
How can you surprise your father like that?

472
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,450
Let's talk about this another time.

473
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,684
What's there to talk about another time?

474
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,609
You personally saw how your Hyung
went to hell for a woman,

475
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,374
how can you make decisions like these?

476
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:21,149
<i>How can my children have such
taste when it comes to women?</i>

477
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,666
If we look at it in perspective,

478
00:34:23,786 --> 00:34:26,884
there's nothing wrong with Yeon Jae at all.

479
00:34:27,004 --> 00:34:28,706
<i>But, if you use your heart to look at her,</i>

480
00:34:28,826 --> 00:34:31,016
she's actually a really good person.

481
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:34,001
Our family needs to have
someone like Yeon Jae.

482
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:36,833
Please believe me,
and accept Yeon Jae.

483
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,425
Hyung and I,

484
00:34:41,021 --> 00:34:43,368
is it so hard to come to terms?

485
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:46,967
Where did we go wrong?

486
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:51,230
The one mother that gave birth to us,

487
00:34:52,282 --> 00:34:55,418
doesn't know why we came
to such a hateful point.

488
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,765
Today's tragedy,

489
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:03,333
is a punishment for my past.

490
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:06,152
That's right.

491
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:10,681
I've always been thinking,

492
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:14,080
that taking revenge on Joo Ah Ran
was the only way to recover my life.

493
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,728
Because of that misguided thought,

494
00:35:17,477 --> 00:35:21,139
I've split up my entire family.

495
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,482
I've been hurt,

496
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:26,229
by my own knife.

497
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:28,947
What's the use in saying such things?

498
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:31,783
We have to protect Ah Ran first.

499
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,825
Even if I sell my soul to the dark side,

500
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:37,736
I can't watch Ah Ran suffer anymore.

501
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,444
Let's go visit the victim's family first.

502
00:35:42,327 --> 00:35:43,885
Regarding Ah Ran's crimes,

503
00:35:44,005 --> 00:35:46,515
Mother has also agreed to write a letter.

504
00:35:46,635 --> 00:35:48,317
If Mum's crimes are exposed,

505
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,768
it would be beneficial to Ah Ran as well.

506
00:35:50,888 --> 00:35:53,209
I'll try my best to delay the police.

507
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,683
Is this Kyeong Ran?

508
00:36:15,803 --> 00:36:17,467
Unni, you're fine, right?

509
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:19,382
I really want to go see you, Unni,

510
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:22,708
but I'm afraid of being followed,
so I can't go.

511
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:25,393
You've eaten, right?

512
00:36:25,513 --> 00:36:26,595
I have.

513
00:36:26,715 --> 00:36:28,642
I'm fine.

514
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:29,975
Don't worry.

515
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,279
I've heard of the community
center at Gangwondo.

516
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,232
I've been there once,

517
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:36,467
if you go there, you'll be safe.

518
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:38,570
Hyun Woo, and Director Nam,

519
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:41,415
are also working really hard for Unni.

520
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:45,641
<i>The victim's family has also
agreed to write a letter,</i>

521
00:36:45,761 --> 00:36:47,444
<i>everything will be fine.</i>

522
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,108
Right now,

523
00:36:51,228 --> 00:36:54,301
you've been living for our deceased parents.

524
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,155
Right now, Unni, you have
to live for yourself.

525
00:36:57,889 --> 00:37:01,176
If that's the case, you have to forget
the past and forgive everything.

526
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:03,354
If you don't forgive,

527
00:37:03,474 --> 00:37:05,439
Unni will come into misfortune.

528
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,598
<i>You know what I'm saying, right?</i>

529
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:10,091
Kyeong Ran.

530
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,509
I want to ask you something.

531
00:37:16,157 --> 00:37:17,922
Till now,

532
00:37:19,315 --> 00:37:21,719
you still love Hyun Woo, right?

533
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,264
It might need some time,

534
00:37:26,384 --> 00:37:28,574
but I'll take care of it.

535
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,479
If I had to choose someone,

536
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,676
between Unni and Hyun Woo,

537
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:37,169
my answer is,

538
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,009
Unni.

539
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:45,042
I have to hang up.

540
00:37:45,162 --> 00:37:47,746
The director is waiting for me.

541
00:37:48,328 --> 00:37:50,187
Goodnight.

542
00:37:57,282 --> 00:37:59,067
My sister.

543
00:38:04,431 --> 00:38:06,515
How embarrassing,

544
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,839
and how much she must hate me.

545
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:15,069
Thank you for calling me Unni.

546
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:20,083
I really really wanted to hear that.

547
00:38:23,322 --> 00:38:26,458
Appearing in this disgraceful way,
I'm really sorry.

548
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,022
Unni.

549
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:40,604
Unni.

550
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:44,722
Unni.

551
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,914
So?

552
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,107
Must you hold the wedding today?

553
00:39:01,064 --> 00:39:02,548
I'm sorry.

554
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:03,769
But,

555
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:06,038
I want to keep my promise,

556
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,028
to my wedding.

557
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:10,038
<i>Even if no one comes to my wedding,</i>

558
00:39:10,158 --> 00:39:12,348
I have to hold it.

559
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,373
I will prove it to you for
the rest of my life.

560
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:19,584
Hyun Min,

561
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:20,204
Hyun Min!

562
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,439
Why is this fellow so worrisome too?

563
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:24,185
Has he gone crazy with the idea of marriage?

564
00:39:24,305 --> 00:39:25,316
Honey,

565
00:39:25,436 --> 00:39:28,790
just give in to Hyun Min this once.

566
00:39:29,504 --> 00:39:31,626
I don't want Hyun Min to get hurt,

567
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:35,738
and to live with the woman he loves.

568
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:38,067
<i>As parents, we shouldn't expect anything,</i>

569
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:40,671
<i>but to think of Hyun Min.</i>

570
00:39:48,759 --> 00:39:50,938
Are you going out?

571
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:52,609
I'm going to Seoul.

572
00:39:52,729 --> 00:39:55,664
The police are looking for you,
will you be fine?

573
00:39:56,772 --> 00:40:00,284
You know that you're going to the community
center today, right?

574
00:40:00,404 --> 00:40:01,917
Yes.

575
00:40:02,037 --> 00:40:04,349
Before that, I have something I need to do.

576
00:40:05,025 --> 00:40:06,903
It won't be too long.

577
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:28,889
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,786
I can't give you a proper wedding,

579
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:33,645
so we can only come to the photo studio.

580
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,749
But to repay you for the lack
of a wedding ceremony,

581
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:38,528
I'll definitely let you put on
a beautiful wedding dress.

582
00:40:38,648 --> 00:40:40,537
So what?

583
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:45,254
More than that, I feel uneasy that
we're letting down your family.

584
00:40:45,374 --> 00:40:48,014
How hurt they have to be right now.

585
00:40:48,134 --> 00:40:49,855
I'm a bad woman.

586
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:53,224
Suffer a little on the wedding day,

587
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:56,398
but it's alright if you make
them happy in the future.

588
00:40:56,518 --> 00:40:58,050
I'll do well.

589
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:59,759
Be strong.

590
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:03,809
Here, look here!

591
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,650
Look a little closer.

592
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:08,523
Here... One, two...

593
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:12,844
Dad!

594
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,516
You came?

595
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,997
Father, thank you!

596
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:23,063
Let go of me.

597
00:41:23,183 --> 00:41:25,673
I didn't come to see you get married.

598
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:28,959
Your mother insisted on coming
to take a family photo,

599
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,384
so we came to take a photo.

600
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,299
Then, let's hurry and take a photo.

601
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,835
Mother, and Brother-in-law, come over.

602
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:37,788
Ahgassi too.

603
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,934
- Here...
- Father, you have to smile!

604
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:43,882
Ahgassi too!

605
00:41:45,762 --> 00:41:48,429
<i>Alright, look here.</i>

606
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,790
<i>Let's take another one</i>

607
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:01,473
What is this?

608
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:03,877
Is this a wedding car?

609
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:07,503
The preparations were a little rushed,
so we couldn't prepare anything.

610
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,114
Here's a card for four days and
three nights in a hotel,

611
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:11,766
have fun.

612
00:42:11,886 --> 00:42:13,532
Hurry and leave,

613
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:16,452
do you want to spend the night here?

614
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,286
Honey,

615
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,370
I'll go out for a while,

616
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,920
to make preparations for
Hyun Min's wedding room.

617
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,004
I want to go out and catch a breath too.

618
00:42:45,124 --> 00:42:47,352
What breath?

619
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:50,766
You've only taken care of the old man for
a couple of days, you're tired already?

620
00:42:50,886 --> 00:42:53,865
She might feel a little empty
because of Hyun Min's wedding,

621
00:42:53,985 --> 00:42:55,536
Hyun Ji and I are here too,

622
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,489
let Mother go.

623
00:42:58,072 --> 00:43:00,025
It's cold out,
so you should take my car.

624
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:03,446
Don't catch a cold just because
you have to take the bus.

625
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,437
Thank you.

626
00:44:47,805 --> 00:44:49,814
Yes, this is Pyeong Chang Dong.

627
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:53,571
What?!

628
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:05,189
It's me.

629
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:07,387
I was about to call.

630
00:45:07,507 --> 00:45:09,782
The police station just called.

631
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,829
They've just received the letter,

632
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:14,289
so on the whole, they're
going to handle it lightly.

633
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:16,805
Ah Ran, you can come back now.

634
00:45:33,858 --> 00:45:35,642
Mother.

635
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,943
Mum.

636
00:45:56,544 --> 00:45:58,872
Why is your hand so cold?

637
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:02,074
What in the world,

638
00:46:02,656 --> 00:46:06,074
how long were you out in the cold?

639
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:13,649
Hyun Ji,

640
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,273
quickly get a blanket.

641
00:46:18,419 --> 00:46:20,804
Mum is really cold, hurry!

642
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:33,195
Even if you die,
I can't forgive you either.

643
00:46:35,244 --> 00:46:38,756
You might as well just take me with you.

644
00:46:40,653 --> 00:46:43,244
Let's go together!

645
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:00,106
<i>Mother.</i>

646
00:47:00,226 --> 00:47:02,002
<i>Mum, mum.</i>

647
00:47:04,594 --> 00:47:06,190
<i>Mum.</i>

648
00:47:06,613 --> 00:47:08,773
<i>Mum, mum</i>

649
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:10,838
<i>Mum!</i>

650
00:47:47,585 --> 00:47:48,881
No.

651
00:47:57,043 --> 00:47:58,545
No.

652
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,673
Stop.

653
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,401
Don't go.

654
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,204
Don't go!

655
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:28,467
From now on,

656
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,987
I won't do anything.

657
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:38,320
Just stay by my side.

658
00:48:42,695 --> 00:48:46,188
I still have a lot to tell you.

659
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,505
Thank you for giving birth to me,

660
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,951
I'm sorry I kept hating you.

661
00:49:02,244 --> 00:49:05,550
I still have a lot to tell you.

662
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,104
Why did you just leave like that?!

663
00:49:23,648 --> 00:49:27,141
<i>I wanted to call you Mother too.</i>

664
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:40,203
I'm sorry, Mother.

665
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,983
We've just begun the investigation
on Jo Kyung Hee.

666
00:49:49,103 --> 00:49:51,368
The accident happened because
of the problem with the brake.

667
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,734
A problem with the brake?

668
00:49:54,478 --> 00:49:55,849
That can't be.

669
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:58,290
At the workshop last week,
everything was fine,

670
00:49:58,410 --> 00:49:59,886
how could there suddenly be a problem?

671
00:50:00,006 --> 00:50:01,595
According to the experts,

672
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:05,464
someone intentionally tampered
with the brakes.

673
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:08,081
Is there someone you can think of?

674
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:09,640
That's right.

675
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,386
Joo Ah Ran!

676
00:50:11,506 --> 00:50:13,564
A person who has ill intentions
to our family,

677
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:14,882
there's only that person!

678
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:17,530
Don't say anything you don't have proof of.

679
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:19,032
<i>Oh, right.</i>

680
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:21,590
I saw Ah Ran behind the potted plants,

681
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,201
she was hiding in a corner staring at us.

682
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,966
<i>Then,</i>

683
00:50:26,086 --> 00:50:28,276
<i>Joo Ah Ran, like your mother,</i>

684
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:30,811
<i>tampered with the brakes?</i>

685
00:50:30,931 --> 00:50:31,818
Could it be?

686
00:50:31,938 --> 00:50:33,978
<i>Go find out where Joo Ah Ran is...</i>

687
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:35,687
No.

688
00:50:37,283 --> 00:50:39,593
Ah Ran couldn't have done that.

689
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:51,444
Where I'm going,

690
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:53,654
don't tell anyone at all.

691
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,842
I don't think I need this
hand phone anymore.

692
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:08,072
Take care of your health,
and live well.

693
00:51:08,192 --> 00:51:11,058
If there's any difficulty,
please contact me.

694
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,497
It's me.

695
00:51:15,617 --> 00:51:17,844
I'm going to pick your Unni up.

696
00:51:17,964 --> 00:51:20,097
Where is your Unni?

697
00:51:21,487 --> 00:51:23,459
Alright, I get it.

698
00:51:24,671 --> 00:51:26,530
Joo Ah Ran,

699
00:51:27,225 --> 00:51:29,722
did you have to go to the extreme?

700
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:32,614
No matter what, she's my mother.

701
00:51:32,734 --> 00:51:35,186
If you loved me at all,

702
00:51:35,787 --> 00:51:38,040
you'd have held back just a little.

703
00:52:50,464 --> 00:52:51,910
Joo Ah Ran!

704
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:55,872
Joo Seung.

705
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,917
Did you really...

706
00:53:13,518 --> 00:53:15,039
do it?

707
00:53:20,742 --> 00:53:22,676
Don't come over!

708
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,831
Don't take another step.

709
00:53:27,259 --> 00:53:29,024
Why did you do it?

710
00:53:29,642 --> 00:53:32,403
Everything was getting better,
why did you have to do it?!

711
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:36,741
If you loved me at all,
you would have held back.

712
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,407
Was the love I gave you,

713
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,705
that insufficient?

714
00:53:43,414 --> 00:53:45,029
Stand there!

715
00:53:46,287 --> 00:53:48,954
If you come over, I'll die.

716
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,341
That's impossible.

717
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:58,744
How could you...

718
00:53:58,864 --> 00:54:00,547
my mother...

719
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:07,470
Joo Ah Ran!

720
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,423
Stand there!

721
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,306
Joo Ah Ran!

722
00:54:16,426 --> 00:54:19,208
Stay there!

723
00:54:19,328 --> 00:54:20,597
Joo Ah Ran!

724
00:54:20,717 --> 00:54:22,231
Stay there!

725
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:23,508
Joo Ah Ran!

726
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:25,067
Stay there!

727
00:54:25,187 --> 00:54:28,053
Stay there!

728
00:54:28,442 --> 00:54:31,127
Stay, there, Joo Ah Ran!

729
00:54:32,217 --> 00:54:34,301
Joo Ah Ran, stay there!

730
00:54:34,421 --> 00:54:36,536
Stay there!

731
00:55:05,894 --> 00:55:07,490
Don't come over.

732
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,406
Don't come over!

733
00:55:12,132 --> 00:55:13,541
Joo Ah Ran.

734
00:55:13,661 --> 00:55:16,095
It's no use running away.

735
00:55:16,215 --> 00:55:18,142
Turn yourself in now.

736
00:55:18,874 --> 00:55:20,977
That's right, let me go.

737
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,293
I've never asked for anything,

738
00:55:24,763 --> 00:55:26,678
till the day I die,

739
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,213
can't I hide here, just to live here?

740
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:32,565
Repent for all the crimes you've done first.

741
00:55:32,685 --> 00:55:35,720
Here, come here.

742
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,204
I don't want to.

743
00:55:37,324 --> 00:55:39,138
I won't go to prison.

744
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:42,221
Thinking about how I lived
brings me to tears.

745
00:55:42,954 --> 00:55:46,015
Do you still want me to waste
my life in prison?

746
00:55:48,043 --> 00:55:50,334
Now, I want to live like a person.

747
00:55:51,338 --> 00:55:53,291
Like our Kyeong Ran said,

748
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:55,845
the rest of my life is for me.

749
00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:59,019
I want to do the things that I wish to do,
and to live thinking about myself.

750
00:56:42,323 --> 00:56:44,445
<i>Don't feel sorry.</i>

751
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,619
<i>Right now,</i>

752
00:56:48,351 --> 00:56:50,868
<i>I'm really really peaceful.</i>

753
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:56,038
<i>During this period of time,</i>

754
00:56:56,864 --> 00:56:59,549
<i>I've been really tired,</i>

755
00:57:03,402 --> 00:57:05,712
<i>I want to rest now.</i>

756
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:08,491
<i>I met, the person I really
wanted to see, Kyeong Ran,</i>

757
00:57:09,395 --> 00:57:12,137
<i>and I undid the knots in my heart.</i>

758
00:57:13,734 --> 00:57:16,232
<i>Now, there's nothing left to hold on to.</i>

759
00:57:19,218 --> 00:57:21,189
<i>Mum, Dad,</i>

760
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:25,234
<i>you must be really happy to see me, right?</i>

761
00:57:28,633 --> 00:57:30,210
<i>At this moment,</i>

762
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:36,428
<i>I suddenly really want to see Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

763
00:57:39,076 --> 00:57:41,330
<i>The man I really loved,</i>

764
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:45,288
<i>should be Ahn Jae Sung.</i>

765
00:57:48,649 --> 00:57:51,447
<i>I've never told him this.</i>

766
00:57:53,628 --> 00:57:55,450
<i>Please tell him,</i>

767
00:57:56,332 --> 00:57:58,041
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

768
00:58:00,145 --> 00:58:01,703
<i>Also,</i>

769
00:58:02,871 --> 00:58:06,871
<i>if you find anything useful in my body,</i>

770
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:11,547
<i>give it to someone who needs help.</i>

771
00:58:19,189 --> 00:58:23,658
<i>The main suspect in the murder of
Madam Jo at Pyeong Chang Do,</i>

772
00:58:23,778 --> 00:58:27,136
<i>Ms. Joo's body, has been found
by someone this early morning.</i>

773
00:58:27,256 --> 00:58:30,498
<i>The police suspect that
the main suspect, Ms. Joo,</i>

774
00:58:30,618 --> 00:58:33,052
<i>had a personal grudge against Madam Jo,</i>

775
00:58:33,172 --> 00:58:36,761
<i>and tampered with the brake on
Madam Jo's car, killing Madam Jo.</i>

776
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:58,001
<i>[Deceased: Joo Ah Ran]</i>

777
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:04,104
I can't understand.

778
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:07,463
How Unni,

779
00:59:08,571 --> 00:59:11,257
would do something like that to Madam.

780
00:59:12,797 --> 00:59:14,975
Stop thinking about it.

781
00:59:15,324 --> 00:59:16,432
Be it Mum,

782
00:59:16,552 --> 00:59:18,179
or Ah Ran,

783
00:59:18,724 --> 00:59:21,202
they've gone to somewhere peaceful.

784
00:59:21,935 --> 00:59:23,493
At that place,

785
00:59:23,613 --> 00:59:25,489
both of them are innocent.

786
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:27,968
She told Director that
at the community center,

787
00:59:28,088 --> 00:59:32,562
she wanted to live out her life,

788
00:59:32,682 --> 00:59:35,330
as a volunteer.

789
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:38,516
Then, I don't understand,

790
00:59:38,636 --> 00:59:42,103
why Unni would do something like that.

791
00:59:42,985 --> 00:59:45,990
Since she already made such a decision,

792
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:49,441
why could she not forgive
Madam till the end,

793
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:56,391
and live diligently till the end.

794
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:59,927
If I knew this was going to happen,

795
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:04,716
I should have let Ah Ran and Joo Seung
leave at the beginning.

796
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:08,278
Why was I,

797
01:00:08,398 --> 01:00:10,926
so insistent on my revenge?

798
01:00:11,962 --> 01:00:13,728
Unni.

799
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:15,624
Go well.

800
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:20,967
In our next lives,

801
01:00:21,775 --> 01:00:24,122
be my Unni again.

802
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,543
Then...

803
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,242
let's not separate,

804
01:00:32,557 --> 01:00:34,679
and not hate each other,

805
01:00:37,658 --> 01:00:39,480
and not fight.

806
01:01:03,068 --> 01:01:04,608
<i>Ah Ran,</i>

807
01:01:05,737 --> 01:01:08,930
<i>didn't want me to tell you
for the time being.</i>

808
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,048
The death report.

809
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:24,820
Why would Unni file a death
report for Joo Kyeong Ran?

810
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:29,064
She wanted you to live under
the name of Yun Jae Hee in the future.

811
01:01:30,907 --> 01:01:32,710
So in that case, there would
be no problem if you wanted

812
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:36,748
to marry Teacher Shin.

813
01:01:58,521 --> 01:01:59,742
What?

814
01:01:59,862 --> 01:02:01,507
What does that mean?

815
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:04,089
Mother asked to look at the brake?

816
01:02:04,209 --> 01:02:08,315
She came to our auto club,
and asked to take apart the brake.

817
01:02:08,712 --> 01:02:12,956
Then, everything was fine,
and the accident happened.

818
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,285
Could it be...

819
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:44,436
<i>Joo Seung.</i>

820
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:48,849
<i>Every year when I received
a birthday present from you,</i>

821
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:53,253
<i>I shamelessly anticipated it, and was happy.</i>

822
01:02:54,624 --> 01:02:57,816
<i>There wasn't one I didn't like.</i>

823
01:02:58,637 --> 01:03:00,534
<i>The pearl necklace you sent me,</i>

824
01:03:00,654 --> 01:03:02,412
<i>the scarf,</i>

825
01:03:02,532 --> 01:03:04,478
<i>the blouse.</i>

826
01:03:05,172 --> 01:03:08,421
<i>They were all so precious,
thank you very much.</i>

827
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:12,390
<i>All the crimes I committed,</i>

828
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,906
<i>I'll take them away.</i>

829
01:03:16,183 --> 01:03:21,135
<i>Forgive, the Mum that only left you pain.</i>

830
01:03:23,182 --> 01:03:26,318
<i>But in this last moment before I leave,</i>

831
01:03:27,614 --> 01:03:30,732
<i>I've never regretted giving birth to you.</i>

832
01:03:31,163 --> 01:03:33,736
<i>Father, Hyung and younger brother,</i>

833
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:38,299
<i>are the last presents I leave for you.</i>

834
01:03:48,572 --> 01:03:50,056
Then,

835
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,215
Mum...

836
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:57,675
She...

837
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:05,486
Ah Ran...

838
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:21,664
Ah Ran...

839
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:56,630
<i>1 year later</i>

840
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:13,366
Unni.

841
01:05:14,436 --> 01:05:16,389
Have you been well?

842
01:05:16,953 --> 01:05:19,094
You haven't been cold, right?

843
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:21,986
I know you miss me,

844
01:05:22,523 --> 01:05:24,795
so I brought a photograph.

845
01:05:41,465 --> 01:05:43,099
It's been a while.

846
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,184
Have you been well?

847
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:47,550
Yes, Ahjussi.

848
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:49,052
No,

849
01:05:49,172 --> 01:05:51,606
what about you, President?

850
01:05:51,726 --> 01:05:54,909
I've been really busy, I have no energy.

851
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:58,909
Occasionally, I see the news in the papers,

852
01:05:59,029 --> 01:06:01,613
congratulations on your big expansion in SM.

853
01:06:02,187 --> 01:06:06,093
Madam, today is her death
anniversary, right?

854
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,483
Yes.

855
01:06:09,663 --> 01:06:12,180
You don't know the news
about Joo Seung, right?

856
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:15,410
He seems like he's still travelling around.

857
01:06:16,877 --> 01:06:20,840
Once in a while, he sends a postcard
so I won't forget him.

858
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:24,464
I told him he had to come home
for Mum's death anniversary,

859
01:06:24,584 --> 01:06:25,967
I don't know.

860
01:06:27,934 --> 01:06:32,572
Losing the two people he loved
the most in one day,

861
01:06:33,624 --> 01:06:36,835
that pain, won't disappear so easily.

862
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:39,097
Right.

863
01:06:39,217 --> 01:06:42,083
I applied for the name,

864
01:06:42,203 --> 01:06:43,905
Joo Kyeong Ran.

865
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:47,661
Is that so?

866
01:06:48,864 --> 01:06:50,329
Good job.

867
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:57,296
Then, I'm going to leave.

868
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,315
Director is sick.

869
01:06:59,435 --> 01:07:02,451
I have to cook for the children.

870
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:45,691
<i>Like a snowflake floating towards you,</i>

871
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:47,813
<i>don't hesitate, don't stop.</i>

872
01:08:47,933 --> 01:08:49,391
<i>Don't hide.</i>

873
01:08:49,511 --> 01:08:51,542
<i>I want to float into your arms,</i>

874
01:08:51,662 --> 01:08:54,948
<i>and become part of a snowdrift,
an everlasting snowdrift.</i>

875
01:08:57,446 --> 01:08:58,986
<i>There,</i>

876
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:02,917
<i>are the two people I occasionally protect,</i>

877
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:06,786
<i>One is my wife.</i>

878
01:09:07,387 --> 01:09:09,941
<i>One is my mother's son.</i>

879
01:09:11,392 --> 01:09:13,645
<i>One person is dead,</i>

880
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,612
<i>one person is tragic.</i>

881
01:09:18,565 --> 01:09:22,152
<i>But why am I not happy right now?</i>

882
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:27,489
<i>If I had handed the crimes
of those two people to God,</i>

883
01:09:28,222 --> 01:09:30,550
<i>would our lives be different?</i>

884
01:09:32,198 --> 01:09:33,907
<i>Joo Ah Ran,</i>

885
01:09:34,027 --> 01:09:35,653
<i>you've won.</i>

886
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,986
<i>Because, the last person who cut
off the tail of your revenge was me.</i>

887
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,950
<i>My mother's crimes,</i>

888
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:48,180
<i>for forgiving them before you left,</i>

889
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:50,189
<i>thank you.</i>

Temptation Of An Angel

00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,540
Episode 14

3
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:09,823
Shin Hyun Woo.

4
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:19,761
Hyun Woo hyung.

5
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:21,422
It's been a long time.

6
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,254
So I see you're alive.

7
00:00:25,643 --> 00:00:29,330
- What are you talking about now?
- Keep those childish acting skills!

8
00:00:29,746 --> 00:00:33,987
With another face, another voice,
you think I wouldn't know?

9
00:00:34,107 --> 00:00:35,920
<i>What plans do you have?</i>

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,126
If you're alive like this, and not going
home, what plans do you have?

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,523
Are you following me?

12
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:44,672
The hospital is about to be transferred, you
actually have time to waste time like this?

13
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:47,323
How did you survive the fire?

14
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:51,435
In order to hide your burns,
you underwent plastic surgery?

15
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,042
Joo Seung.

16
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:57,161
I'm a doctor.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,993
No matter what Hyung changes into,

18
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:02,017
<i>as long as I have a drop of blood,</i>

19
00:01:02,137 --> 00:01:04,596
a strand of hair,

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,350
I'll be able to tell who you are.

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,726
<i>Aren't you going to let him go?</i>

22
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,007
{\a6}Episode 14

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,998
Why are you so clingy and pathetic?

24
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:20,239
Didn't I ask you to let it
go cleanly like a man?

25
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,336
Why are you so persistent and tiring?

26
00:01:22,377 --> 00:01:25,931
This man here, is not Ahn Jae Sung,
but Shin Hyun Woo.

27
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:26,666
What?

28
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:29,062
He had surgery to get another person's face,

29
00:01:29,182 --> 00:01:32,454
and purposely got closer
to you in order to take revenge.

30
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:35,177
Finding evidence to show
that you killed Hyun Woo Hyung,

31
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:38,091
and then pushing you into
desperation, how could I not know?

32
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,534
Joo Seung.

33
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,874
If you don't believe it, take a look at this.

34
00:01:46,446 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>Can't you see the words, "Shin Hyun Woo"?</i>

35
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,002
If it wasn't really Hyun Woo Hyung,

36
00:01:52,122 --> 00:01:55,905
how could he use Hyun Woo Hyung's
name and do business with the bank?

37
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:59,473
With such clear evidence,
why don't you believe what I'm saying?

38
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:03,204
It's because of this?

39
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:08,923
That bank book, I gave it to Jae Sung.

40
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:10,972
What?

41
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:13,268
The code to Shin Hyun Woo's
bank account changed,

42
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:16,237
that's why I asked
Jae Sung to do me a favor.

43
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,820
How did things go, are they settled?

44
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,298
After I showed them your ID,

45
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:32,348
they told me just like
I was Shin Hyun Woo himself.

46
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:36,188
The money in the account
has all been taken out.

47
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,905
I was so worried,
it's such a relief.

48
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:40,349
Thank you so much.

49
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:43,453
Lies, nonsense!

50
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:48,137
Then what about the plastic surgery,
what about the painkillers?!

51
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:50,276
Because I have a slipped disc,

52
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:53,462
I had a prescription for painkillers filled at a
hospital owned by one of my closest Hyung's.

53
00:02:53,582 --> 00:02:56,213
Do I have to explain something like that?

54
00:02:57,356 --> 00:02:59,181
Other than that,

55
00:02:59,301 --> 00:03:02,721
what evidence is there concerning
Shin Hyun Woo's death?

56
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,306
Could it be,

57
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:07,438
that Ah Ran has something to do
with Shin Hyun Woo's death?

58
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:09,780
What are you saying?

59
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,414
That's ridiculous.

60
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:15,063
<i>Don't you understand that
Doctor Nam is trying to trick us?</i>

61
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,968
You have to rush back to
the office, don't you.

62
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:20,474
You should head back first.

63
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:22,299
All right.

64
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,905
I'll call you.

65
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,215
What are you doing?

66
00:03:37,335 --> 00:03:40,129
Are you going around
saying I killed Shin Hyun Woo?

67
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:42,254
What if Ahn Jae Sung's
suspicions are aroused?

68
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:45,477
You killed Shin Hyun Woo,
could Ahn Jae Sung not know about it?

69
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,064
That's because Ahn Jae Sung
is Shin Hyun Woo.

70
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,693
I really don't understand
why you're so persistent.

71
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,907
Mother's favorite son is dead,

72
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,128
and her other son was in love with his wife,
shouldn't your revenge be over by now?

73
00:04:00,248 --> 00:04:01,273
We're not talking about me right now.

74
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:04,397
Are you really that angry that
Mother doesn't want to accept you?

75
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,222
But you have your mother,

76
00:04:06,342 --> 00:04:08,342
your profession as a doctor,

77
00:04:09,253 --> 00:04:11,013
and your siblings.

78
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,363
For someone who has 99 houses,

79
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,693
do you want to use me as a shield,
and get your hundredth?

80
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:19,301
It is a fact that I hate
the mother that birthed me,

81
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:22,502
but I don't want to ruin
you in order to fulfill my desire.

82
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:25,131
Now, I have no interest in revenge,

83
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:28,935
and I have no other thoughts but
protecting you from Shin Hyun Woo.

84
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:32,094
If you ever loved me at all,

85
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:36,038
you would give me freedom now.

86
00:04:36,158 --> 00:04:39,034
The investor that helped
me was Jo Sung Mo's sister,

87
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,748
and after the family found out about my past,
they leapt at me like they wanted to kill me.

88
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:44,122
Even President Hwang is strangling my neck.

89
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,368
If you force me as well,

90
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,743
there is only death for me.

91
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,821
<i>The aftereffects of the plastic surgery
on your entire body is very severe.</i>

92
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:24,025
<i>The site of the skin
grafts keep getting infected,</i>

93
00:05:24,145 --> 00:05:28,216
<i>and your heart is getting weaker,
unreasonably working out is also very dangerous.</i>

94
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:38,611
You're here.

95
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,601
What medicine is that?

96
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,874
Are you feeling unwell?

97
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:46,397
It's a medicine that I have
to take for the rest of my life.

98
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:48,471
Because of the traffic accident and
the aftereffects of the plastic surgery,

99
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:51,142
my entire body is plagued
with strange symptoms.

100
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:54,048
It's a pain that will accompany
me for the rest of my life,

101
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:55,875
I'm used to it.

102
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:59,461
I always thought

103
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:02,726
only gods could punish human beings.

104
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:05,674
But, my thoughts have changed.

105
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:08,027
I won't blame it on the gods anymore.

106
00:06:08,147 --> 00:06:11,616
<i>The price of my brother's life,
the price of your pain,</i>

107
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:14,345
I will personally reap it back.

108
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,766
The real revenge,

109
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:20,180
is to wait for the other party to get more,

110
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:25,395
before you see them fall,
even more tragically.

111
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:35,534
<i>The child that Mom abandoned,</i>

112
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,657
<i>how great could he grow up to be?</i>

113
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:41,583
<i>Even the mother that gave birth to
him pretends not to know him,</i>

114
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,682
<i>there's nothing to hope for either.</i>

115
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,120
<i>To understand the hate
accompanying the death of your son,</i>

116
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,008
<i>you want to kill that son you've
pretended not to know for 30 years?</i>

117
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,365
That's right.

118
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,234
Ah Ran and Joo Seung must know something.

119
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:06,941
If Hyun Woo's father knows too...

120
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:14,038
Could you know,
a way to contact the Father?

121
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:15,544
I don't know.

122
00:07:15,664 --> 00:07:17,876
He either calls me directly,

123
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:21,054
or he contacts the people
who brought me here.

124
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,284
What?

125
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:24,383
The people who brought me here?

126
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:27,520
Wasn't I abandoned in the orphanage?

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,365
<i>Director, that's what you said.</i>

128
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,140
Is there really a ghost?

129
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,404
Do you remember the factory
manager that died 25 years ago?

130
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,420
My hands are too slippery.

131
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:50,490
I've forgotten it after
living for so many years,

132
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,328
but this has been pressing
on my chest recently.

133
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:57,550
<i>Hyun Woo's death,</i>

134
00:07:57,847 --> 00:08:00,603
<i>the instability of the company too,</i>

135
00:08:00,723 --> 00:08:03,102
it feels like a ghost is toying with us.

136
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,413
Keep your voice down,
the children can hear you.

137
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:08,657
So what if they hear?
I haven't done anything wrong.

138
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,841
Someone who moves lumber,

139
00:08:10,961 --> 00:08:15,098
he brought his family during working hours,
and died because of his own mistake.

140
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:18,469
It's not that I killed him,
what do I have to feel bad about.

141
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:21,921
Please tell me,

142
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,159
who was the person who brought me here.

143
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:28,190
All right,

144
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,798
it shouldn't be a secret anymore.

145
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:35,398
Actually, the person who's always supported
you, President Shin, his mother,

146
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,475
was the person who brought you here.

147
00:08:37,595 --> 00:08:38,684
What?

148
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,295
Madam?

149
00:08:42,009 --> 00:08:46,875
She always took care of
you like you were family.

150
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,567
<i>Maybe she had some difficulties,</i>

151
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,730
<i>she never explained the details.</i>

152
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,960
Madam...

153
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,472
Why would she leave me here?

154
00:08:55,592 --> 00:08:57,508
How did she know me?

155
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,055
About that...

156
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,642
Maybe you're distant relatives.

157
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,999
At first, it was the chauffeur that came,

158
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:07,592
after that it was her son.

159
00:09:08,164 --> 00:09:11,514
Just now, I heard my
Uncle called them.

160
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,694
Then, Madam should know
my Uncle's contact details.

161
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,735
Mom.

162
00:09:43,812 --> 00:09:45,000
Dad.

163
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:50,998
It's almost coming.

164
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:57,328
God might pity me too,

165
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:01,632
and sent me someone who could help me.

166
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:05,045
<i>Just wait a while,</i>

167
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:10,118
I'll personally close your eyes.

168
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:34,057
<i>Here, a birthday present for our Ah Ran.</i>

169
00:10:34,624 --> 00:10:37,316
Here's another pair of Kyeong Ran.

170
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,330
Wow, it's too pretty.

171
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,726
Kyeong Ran, Unni's is pretty too, right?

172
00:10:41,846 --> 00:10:44,122
<i>Don't keep them, wear them all you like.</i>

173
00:10:44,242 --> 00:10:46,234
If they're too small you
won't be able to wear them.

174
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,732
I might lose them, so I should
write my name on them.

175
00:11:00,587 --> 00:11:02,750
<i>What are you doing on the new shoes?</i>

176
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,297
Kyeong Ran's too.

177
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:08,048
<i>In any case, our Ah Ran is the brightest.</i>

178
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,448
Here.

179
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:15,010
Kyeong Ran.

180
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:24,822
Kyeong Ran.

181
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,592
Where are you?

182
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,851
How hungry you must be,

183
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:40,289
and how hard your life must be.

184
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:56,620
Director.

185
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,406
Nurse Yoon.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,099
I would like to know something.

187
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,745
What relationship do you
have with Ahn Jae Sung?

188
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:10,137
I... love President Ahn.

189
00:12:10,257 --> 00:12:14,186
<i>But because of that, I'm always
being threatened by Joo Ah Ran.</i>

190
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:15,480
<i>Please help me.</i>

191
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,939
<i>Doesn't Director love Joo Ah Ran?</i>

192
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,105
Let me love President Ahn freely,

193
00:12:20,225 --> 00:12:23,158
please, Director, catch hold of
Joo Ah Ran. I'm begging you.

194
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:24,918
Tell me honestly.

195
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:27,823
The person that Nurse Yoon loves,

196
00:12:27,943 --> 00:12:30,721
is it Ahn Jae Sung, or Shin Hyun Woo?

197
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,792
As long as you answer this,
I'll help Nurse Yoon.

198
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:38,396
What are you suspicious about?

199
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:41,836
The last time I saw Patient
Shin was that day at the villa.

200
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,659
His death in that fire,
I only heard about it later.

201
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,712
When the fire broke out
at the Yang Pyeong villa,

202
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,002
the person that helped
Shin Woo Hyung was Nurse Yoon.

203
00:12:49,122 --> 00:12:51,931
<i>Is there a reason to help Hyun Woo Hyung?</i>

204
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:54,687
Could you have known each other from before?

205
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,909
Wasn't the person who introduced
Patient Shin Hyun Woo to me, you, Director?

206
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,953
And the person that made me meet
President Ahn, was also, you Director.

207
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,416
<i>No!</i>

208
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:06,932
President Ahn Jae Sung and Nurse Yoon,
you knew each other from before.

209
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:09,211
<i>I've seen the two of you together.</i>

210
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,430
If the Director and Joo Ah Ran,
keeps torturing me like that,

211
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,054
I might as well tell the truth
to Patient Shin Hyun Woo's family,

212
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,195
just to shake off the two of you.

213
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:20,298
Are you threatening me right now?

214
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,736
That's not a threat,
that's asking for a favor.

215
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:25,830
Then, goodbye.

216
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,733
Who is it?

217
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,320
Where did you go?
I waited a long time.

218
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,610
Is that so?

219
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,939
I went to the orphanage
after I got off work.

220
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:10,150
Actually, my Uncle came over,
and said he wanted to see me.

221
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,465
Is that so?

222
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,818
That's good, are there any contact details?

223
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,578
Not yet,

224
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:18,122
What I want to find out,

225
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:23,579
I'm not sure, if Madam has any
information that could help me.

226
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:26,420
Well...

227
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,833
She did say that a pretty
girl wanted some help,

228
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,996
but didn't say anything else.

229
00:14:32,116 --> 00:14:33,925
Today, I heard from the Director,

230
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:37,996
that Madam was the one
who brought me to the orphanage.

231
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:42,258
Was I... someone's child
that Madam knew?

232
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:45,078
I heard about it a while ago,

233
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,232
but it's not like I could go ask Mom
about it, what a headache.

234
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:53,408
Or not, Jae Hee, why don't you ask Mother directly?

235
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:57,490
Take the opportunity to tell her you
were the little lantern that received help.

236
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,716
Can I... really do that?

237
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:03,957
I'm sorry.

238
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:07,426
Even with this,
I can't help you at all.

239
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,095
As a compensation,
tell me another wish,

240
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,258
I'll try and fulfill it.

241
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,653
Another... wish?

242
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:22,319
I want to see the sea in the winter.

243
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:24,588
Do you want to come with me?

244
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,091
<i>Jae Hee.</i>

245
00:15:53,678 --> 00:15:55,904
There's no one here.

246
00:15:56,434 --> 00:15:59,784
Let's yell out the stories in our heart.

247
00:15:59,904 --> 00:16:01,629
Of course,

248
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:05,729
in front of the sea,
everyone wants to spill their hearts.

249
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,612
It's just like an explosion in
your heart that clears everything away.

250
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:11,183
Why? Just shout out loud.

251
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,413
I am...

252
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,323
Shin Hyun Woo!

253
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,564
My name is...

254
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,850
Shin Hyun Woo!

255
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:33,596
Shin Hyun Woo,

256
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,903
wait a while more.

257
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:40,444
I'll immediately use your name to return.

258
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:46,641
Grit your teeth and hold on, you punk.

259
00:16:48,343 --> 00:16:49,763
<i>Ahjussi.</i>

260
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,063
It's my turn.

261
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:56,786
'Till now,

262
00:16:57,295 --> 00:17:00,538
I've never called out for Dad and Mom.

263
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:04,168
<i>I have to gather up some
courage and shout for them.</i>

264
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,031
It has to be really loud
to travel to the heavens,

265
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:10,215
you can't mock me.

266
00:17:13,564 --> 00:17:15,514
Dad!

267
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,991
Mom!

268
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,960
Can they hear you like that?

269
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:25,612
In order to get rid of all
the grievances you've faced so far,

270
00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,329
it has to be louder!

271
00:17:28,304 --> 00:17:30,584
Dad!

272
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:34,719
Mom!

273
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,408
Unni!

274
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:42,459
Where are you?

275
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:45,258
You haven't forgotten me, right?

276
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,350
Why aren't you coming to look for me?

277
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,592
Waiting like this,

278
00:17:53,992 --> 00:17:56,663
I think I'm going to go crazy.

279
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,521
<i>Jae Hee,</i>

280
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,436
<i>I will definitely look for
your family for you.</i>

281
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,132
<i>Don't cry.</i>

282
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:10,987
<i>Once you cry, I feel like
my heart is going to explode.</i>

283
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,494
<i>I love you,</i>

284
00:18:14,682 --> 00:18:16,632
<i>I love you, Jae Hee.</i>

285
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,168
<i>What happened with the
matter I asked you to look into?</i>

286
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:27,618
Factory Manager Joo Chul Ming, we've already gotten
a hold of the address for his brother and his wife.

287
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:28,572
<i>Is that so?</i>

288
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,926
<i>Call the office immediately.</i>

289
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:36,269
What that family is planning on doing,
we have to take a thorough look.

290
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:40,339
<i>Who is the person that is disturbing
someone who has been dead for 25 years?</i>

291
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:42,629
<i>Are they doing evil to our family?</i>

292
00:18:42,749 --> 00:18:44,785
<i>I have to find that all out.</i>

293
00:18:48,686 --> 00:18:51,018
Did you have a good sleep, Father?

294
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,414
Did something bad happen?

295
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,510
Don't get involved in our family matters.

296
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:00,602
Double check again, when the money
from Myeong Sung Electronics is coming in.

297
00:19:01,068 --> 00:19:02,446
That...

298
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:05,002
President Hwang might need more time,

299
00:19:05,122 --> 00:19:07,249
because of the mistake at the meeting.

300
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:09,221
That's why,

301
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:13,694
why don't we go meet SM Furniture,
in order to expedite the merger deal?

302
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:15,327
SM Furniture?

303
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,312
Such a strong company is investing in us,

304
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:21,344
what reason is there to merge
with such a small company?

305
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:24,185
SM Furniture is not a
company to be taken lightly.

306
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,079
They've just expanded their business online,

307
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:33,745
and there will be less problems in the future,
because their designs are similar to Soul's.

308
00:19:34,164 --> 00:19:36,708
<i>President Hwang hopes for the merger too.</i>

309
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,231
President Hwang too?

310
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,708
He wants you to keep your
position as representative.

311
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:45,167
To Soul it's not a bad deal.

312
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:48,914
Although I don't have
the right as a daughter-in-law,

313
00:19:49,034 --> 00:19:52,412
but when it comes to the business,
it's better to listen to me.

314
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,063
You have to follow him 24 hours.

315
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:06,502
You have to report all the details,
you can't leave anything out.

316
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,919
I understand, please don't worry.

317
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:32,841
Where did you go, that you're back now?

318
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:36,255
It's ddukbokki and fish sticks,
I bought them because Yeon Jae likes them.

319
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,564
Ddukbokki?

320
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:45,857
It was right to wait without eating,
Manager you have some too.

321
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:47,987
You must have been starving the whole day.

322
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,531
I don't want any,
Yeon Jae, you eat them all.

323
00:20:53,181 --> 00:20:54,411
Here.

324
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:58,827
Is it delicious?

325
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:02,198
Of course it's delicious.

326
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,700
I'm so hungry, I'm hallucinating.

327
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,777
Hold on, I'll get you some water.

328
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:15,752
What?

329
00:21:15,872 --> 00:21:19,321
You ate two bowls of ramen,
and you're eating this too?

330
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,311
That's true.

331
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,877
It would have been better if I had held on.

332
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:26,064
Sorry.

333
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:29,377
If you weren't hungry,
you should have said so.

334
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,221
Eating like that, what would
happen if you got sick?

335
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,812
So what if I got sick?

336
00:21:32,932 --> 00:21:35,122
Manager thought about me and bought it.

337
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,726
Even if I stuff myself sick, I'll eat it.

338
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:39,253
Don't worry.

339
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:41,479
Delicious.

340
00:21:43,621 --> 00:21:45,592
What am I?

341
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:47,627
Like a fool,

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,414
everyone can't wait to fight me.

343
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:58,131
Stop eating. You'll really got a stomachache.

344
00:21:58,494 --> 00:22:00,423
Give it to me, I'll eat it.

345
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:02,098
I told you to stop eating.

346
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:04,989
Give it to me, why are
you acting like that?

347
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:12,805
Ddukbokki sauce.

348
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:16,727
I'll wipe it off for you.

349
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,865
Stop laughing.

350
00:22:23,268 --> 00:22:24,858
Stay still, don't move.

351
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:40,192
Because our niece is treating,
it tastes more delicious.

352
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,351
If it's free, everything is delicious.

353
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:44,793
Yes, yes.

354
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,457
Listen to what I'm saying.

355
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:52,488
My father in law is looking
everywhere for you.

356
00:22:52,608 --> 00:22:56,219
If he sends someone to fetch you,
you definitely can't go either.

357
00:22:57,555 --> 00:23:00,523
If the truth gets out that
my father is Factory Manager Joo,

358
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:02,760
we're all done for.

359
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,979
That's something for you to worry about,
we have nothing to fear.

360
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:08,970
For our brother, we need to speak the truth,

361
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:13,677
and to take you out of that
family is also logical for us.

362
00:23:17,193 --> 00:23:19,695
If I die, you die with me too.

363
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:23,660
Telling Father in law the truth,
do you think you'll get ten thousand?

364
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:28,112
We know, we know,
do you think we're outsiders?

365
00:23:31,523 --> 00:23:33,597
What happened with Kyeong Ran?

366
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:36,268
How come there's no news
on finding Kyeong Ran at all?

367
00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:39,715
That...

368
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:44,337
Actually, we found
Kyeong Ran a few days ago.

369
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:45,503
Right?

370
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,026
Is that true?

371
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:50,096
Where's Kyeong Ran?

372
00:23:50,216 --> 00:23:52,810
Can I meet her immediately now?
Where does she stay?

373
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,930
Tell me know.

374
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,135
Yes, yes.

375
00:23:58,126 --> 00:24:00,334
We've made several appointments
with Kyeong Ran to meet her,

376
00:24:00,454 --> 00:24:08,558
but there's a lady that keeps getting
in the way, so it's all for naught.

377
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:10,362
Who's the girl?

378
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:11,465
Who is it?

379
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:15,302
Just the woman who took Kyeong
Ran away from the orphanage.

380
00:24:15,422 --> 00:24:18,716
That woman, we don't know if she's
trying to do a deal using Kyeong Ran,

381
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:22,233
she changed all their numbers,
then ran away.

382
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,883
No matter what, you have to find her.

383
00:24:25,003 --> 00:24:27,582
I'll forget all the things
you've done to me,

384
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:30,105
no matter what, you have to
bring Kyeong Ran in front of me.

385
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,076
If you're clothed in skin and come to the
human world, you have to at least do something!

386
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:43,188
Today, I'm not here as a nurse,
but I'm here because I have something to ask.

387
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,799
Is that so?

388
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,071
Tell me.

389
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,497
What is it you want to ask?

390
00:24:48,815 --> 00:24:51,211
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to come clean with you all this while.

391
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:56,806
Actually, I'm the little lantern from the
Angel Orphanage that Madam supports.

392
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,905
You still remember little lantern?

393
00:24:59,025 --> 00:25:01,831
What are you saying?
Little lantern?

394
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:05,232
Nurse Yoon is little lantern?

395
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:08,222
Yes, that child is me.

396
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:12,356
For 25 years, thank you for taking
care of me like I'm your own child.

397
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:15,500
Coincidentally meeting Patient
Shin Hyun Woo at the Yang Pyeong Villa,

398
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,769
really gave me a shock.

399
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:20,482
How could something like that happen?

400
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,108
Nurse Yoon took care of our Hyun Woo...

401
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,985
I came here today to look for my family.

402
00:25:28,105 --> 00:25:30,062
You helped me,

403
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:34,188
do you know anything about my family?

404
00:25:34,612 --> 00:25:37,071
Ah, that.

405
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:41,036
I only... wanted to help someone.

406
00:25:41,156 --> 00:25:43,898
And very coincidentally,
it happened to be Nurse Yoon.

407
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:50,919
Then, do you know anything
about my parents or my siblings?

408
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,332
Of course. If I knew I would have told you.

409
00:25:55,824 --> 00:25:58,496
I'm really sorry I couldn't help you.

410
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:02,333
No, my gratitude for your
constant help is greater than that.

411
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:04,435
In this lifetime,

412
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:08,464
the debt that I owe Madam,
I will pay it back diligently.

413
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,756
Then, I'll leave first.

414
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,049
Nurse Yoon.

415
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:22,314
It's a little strange.

416
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:26,462
Why have you never said...
that you were little lantern?

417
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,257
My special relationship with Shin Hyun Woo,

418
00:26:30,377 --> 00:26:32,865
I thought I shouldn't let
your daughter-in-law find out.

419
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:35,769
What does that mean?

420
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:39,280
I don't know if I should tell you this,

421
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:44,538
but Patient Shin Hyun Woo regained consciousness
for a little while, at the Yang Pyeong Villa.

422
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:48,359
What?

423
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:51,772
Our Hyun Woo regained consciousness?

424
00:26:52,239 --> 00:26:55,101
Then, why didn't you inform us? Why?

425
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:03,635
Could it be, that our daughter-in-law
told you not to say anything?

426
00:27:04,271 --> 00:27:05,543
I'm sorry,

427
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:09,312
I should have taken every
opportunity to inform you, I’m sorry.

428
00:27:09,432 --> 00:27:13,786
Madam, the fact that you're my sponsor,
please keep it from your daughter-in-law.

429
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:15,058
Then.

430
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,876
How could Ah Ran do something like that?

431
00:27:22,996 --> 00:27:25,484
Hide the fact that Hyun Woo woke up?

432
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:26,586
Why?

433
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,003
What's the reason?

434
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:36,623
In the beginning, they seemed
so strong they wouldn't give way,

435
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,848
and then they gave way to
SM Furniture, in a show of losing,

436
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,476
the next step, I'll handle it.

437
00:27:43,007 --> 00:27:44,321
All right.

438
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,286
I've asked Joo Ah Ran to come to the house.

439
00:27:49,007 --> 00:27:51,157
Let's toast.

440
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:58,599
I've met the brother of the factory manager.

441
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,298
But he keeps claiming that he doesn't know Joo
Chul Ming, and denies ever meeting the President.

442
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:03,846
What?!

443
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:09,061
What are all these beggars
thinking, trying to slip away?

444
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:14,275
If they're really Joo Chul Ming's
siblings, they'll know me.

445
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:17,985
I'll go meet them myself, find out
where they live, and fix a time!

446
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:20,568
There were no mistakes, right?

447
00:28:20,688 --> 00:28:21,628
Yes.

448
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:30,872
This woman...

449
00:28:30,992 --> 00:28:34,134
I heard she's Jung Sang Hwa,
the President of SM Furniture.

450
00:28:34,711 --> 00:28:36,365
President Jung?

451
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:40,542
Ahn Jae Sung is meeting up
with Jung Sang Mo's sister, isn't he?

452
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:45,005
Then...

453
00:29:05,025 --> 00:29:07,315
You like chrysanthemum tea, right?

454
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:15,999
Father seems to have fallen in love
with someone who likes chrysanthemum.

455
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:19,688
The house always smelt like chrysanthemums.

456
00:29:21,517 --> 00:29:24,252
When did you find out I was your mother?

457
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:26,245
Don't say it in that way!

458
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:30,124
Your whole life you were Madam to me,

459
00:29:30,244 --> 00:29:32,983
you should live like that till you die.

460
00:29:33,831 --> 00:29:36,990
<i>The idea that you could
clumsily become my mother,</i>

461
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,792
don't even dream about it.

462
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,128
I reject it.

463
00:29:40,173 --> 00:29:42,375
- Joo Seung.
- Don't call me like that!

464
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:51,538
The Madam... that Dad waited for
every time he closed his eyes,

465
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,700
<i>such a pathetic person,</i>

466
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:58,156
are you going to send him away like that?

467
00:29:58,686 --> 00:30:03,957
To other people, you're
like a charitable Buddha,

468
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,413
<i>but, why are you so harsh,</i>

469
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:11,610
on the person who's missed
you his entire life, why?!

470
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,818
I thought that would be the best
way to protect all of us, to save you.

471
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,938
Keep those explanations!

472
00:30:17,593 --> 00:30:19,014
Just be honest,

473
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:24,484
and say you didn't want
to destroy your family,

474
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:27,642
that I could understand.

475
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,692
Think whatever you like.

476
00:30:32,646 --> 00:30:35,381
I'm already prepared to accept
your hate and your disgust.

477
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:38,953
<i>But, something has to be clarified.</i>

478
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:45,631
Because you hate me, you and Ah Ran
did something horrible to our Hyun Woo, right?!

479
00:30:57,309 --> 00:31:02,164
The day Hyun Woo died in the fire, this is
a photograph of Ah Ran at Yang Pyeong.

480
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:09,161
The Ah Ran that left at 5, and was still at Yang
Pyeong 2 hours later, how do you explain that?

481
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,404
Did Ah Ran go back to the villa?

482
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:15,818
Why? Do you know?!

483
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:18,044
Is it because you hated me,
that's why you killed our Hyun Woo?

484
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,633
Both you and Ah Ran?!

485
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,969
Don't try and stretch the truth.

486
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,962
Stretch the truth?!

487
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:31,730
I know you're angry at me.

488
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:34,804
But, Hyun Woo has no sins.

489
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,680
<i>Now, just tell me all the truth.</i>

490
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:43,157
No matter whatever you say,

491
00:31:43,277 --> 00:31:45,955
I'll keep your secret till my death.

492
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:48,054
I mean it.

493
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:49,602
Hyun Woo Hyung,

494
00:31:50,851 --> 00:31:54,285
died because Madam left
the gas on when she went out.

495
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,331
That's how Madam killed two children.

496
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,336
Me and Hyun Woo Hyung.

497
00:32:01,456 --> 00:32:03,223
Do you understand?

498
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:07,760
If you want to push all your
sins now, to me and Ah Ran,

499
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:12,610
I won't let you do as you wish.

500
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:24,058
The grief of our Hyun Woo,
I'll settle it for him.

501
00:32:25,924 --> 00:32:29,252
Even if my past is discovered, I'll do it too.

502
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,781
<i>How my son died,</i>

503
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,364
I'll definitely find out.

504
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,109
<i>So it turns out this way.</i>

505
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:51,410
<i>I couldn't become Madam's son in the end.</i>

506
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:54,560
<i>Hyun Woo Hyung's death,</i>

507
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,888
<i>if you want to find out, find out.</i>

508
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:04,840
<i>But you better not provoke me.</i>

509
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,327
<i>You're here, President Joo.</i>

510
00:33:20,447 --> 00:33:21,854
Take a seat.

511
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:27,576
<i>Who are you coming to see today?</i>

512
00:33:27,915 --> 00:33:32,071
Julie Jung, or Jung Sang Hwa?

513
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:38,554
From the very beginning,
did you get close to me with a motive?

514
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:41,268
The creation of SM Furniture,

515
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:44,242
was also done with me as a target in mind?

516
00:33:44,362 --> 00:33:45,556
About that,

517
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:49,733
it's a long time ago,
I don't really remember.

518
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,244
The person who gave me
the design, was Sang Mo!

519
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,110
<i>For his Noona to step out,</i>

520
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,718
and plunge his woman into misery,

521
00:33:57,838 --> 00:34:00,241
do you think Sang Mo will be happy?

522
00:34:00,949 --> 00:34:05,841
If Sang Mo wanted my destruction,
he should have killed me, not himself.

523
00:34:07,346 --> 00:34:09,042
Till the end,

524
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,203
you refuse to admit your crime, is that so?

525
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:13,938
All the men in this world,

526
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,779
wouldn't kill themselves because
they fell out of love, right?

527
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:19,247
I know the misery of losing a younger sibling,

528
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:21,558
but don't take it out on me.

529
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:29,021
This is the proposal to
merge Soul with SM Furniture.

530
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:31,680
Read it, and let me know.

531
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:39,398
Soul, taking over SM?

532
00:34:39,518 --> 00:34:40,691
Of course.

533
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,339
If you want to reverse it,
and have SM take over Soul,

534
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,328
I'll file for bankruptcy and
wash my hands of it.

535
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,764
In that case, your investment would go to waste.

536
00:34:54,930 --> 00:35:00,612
If there's something you want to accomplish,
you should accept my proposal.

537
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,551
Then, I await your reply.

538
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,277
It can't be.

539
00:35:21,397 --> 00:35:23,806
If Mom knew, she would have told you.

540
00:35:23,926 --> 00:35:24,781
No,

541
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:28,258
Madam clearly knew something,

542
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:32,059
but I don't know why she's hiding it.

543
00:35:34,009 --> 00:35:36,598
<i>He's meeting with Yoon Jae Hee?</i>

544
00:35:37,494 --> 00:35:38,888
I got it.

545
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,174
Ahn Jae Sung.

546
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:58,694
Now, I've definitely caught you by the tail.

547
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,577
Madam,

548
00:36:02,192 --> 00:36:04,079
what should I do?

549
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:08,147
Before you find out the reasons
behind Hyun Woo Hyung's death,

550
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,942
looks like I'll uncover
Ahn Jae Sung's true face.

551
00:36:19,221 --> 00:36:21,214
Take a good look at the photos.

552
00:36:21,934 --> 00:36:24,881
Ahn Jae Sung knew
Jung Sang Hwa a long time ago.

553
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:28,210
SM Furniture and Ahn Jae Sung
aren't strangers.

554
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:30,970
Nonsense,

555
00:36:32,666 --> 00:36:34,469
this can't be.

556
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:37,866
Even now, he's hiding
his meetings with Yoon Jae Hee.

557
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,668
Why?

558
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:43,611
<i>Ahn Jae Sung and Yoon Jae Hee already
knew each other from Yang Pyeong villa.</i>

559
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:49,924
Clearly he has ill intentions,
and circling around you.

560
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:55,874
Trust me.

561
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,347
<i>If Hyun Woo Hyung comes back alive
and confronts you about your crimes,</i>

562
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,227
I've already made preparations to bear them.

563
00:37:04,905 --> 00:37:08,565
The person who can help you,
in this world, is only me.

564
00:37:12,615 --> 00:37:15,859
But Shin Hyun Woo and Ahn Jae Sung,
are completely different,

565
00:37:16,373 --> 00:37:17,709
even their looks.

566
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:22,818
Because he was burnt at the villa,
he most probably got plastic surgery.

567
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,385
Personality too, interests too, tastes too,

568
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:27,865
they're all completely different.

569
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,731
To fool you,

570
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:31,751
he could have covered it up intentionally.

571
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,846
Also, President Ahn is a
world-class equestrian.

572
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:38,683
How could Shin Hyun Woo,
who hates horses so much...

573
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:40,528
Do that?

574
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,010
Ahn Jae Sung is good at drumming too,

575
00:37:46,795 --> 00:37:48,978
and good at cooking.

576
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:54,960
And he's gifted at sports,
it definitely can't be Shin Hyun Woo.

577
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,821
The fact that he's not like Shin Hyun Woo,

578
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:59,607
is the evidence that Ahn Jae Sung
is Shin Hyun Woo.

579
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,648
If he didn't throw out the horse-hating,

580
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:05,426
Western cuisine-hating Shin Hyun Woo,

581
00:38:05,546 --> 00:38:07,461
there was no way you would believe it.

582
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:10,882
Think about it.

583
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:14,423
Is there something about Shin Woo Hyung,

584
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:18,006
something that he couldn't
change no matter what?

585
00:38:21,863 --> 00:38:22,986
That's right.

586
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:25,085
Fear of heights,

587
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,736
because of his fear of heights,

588
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:30,959
he said he hated taking planes
the most, in this world.

589
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,825
Fear of heights?

590
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:49,203
When I was young, I fell from a horse, so I didn't
like to ride, and also became afraid of heights.

591
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:52,011
Then, race with me.

592
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:55,107
<i>If it's not a game, it's not interesting.</i>

593
00:38:58,077 --> 00:39:00,208
Compared to spaghetti,
bean paste soup is better.

594
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,201
You know, that I prefer Korean food.

595
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:04,427
Maybe because I grew up overseas,

596
00:39:04,547 --> 00:39:07,099
Korean food is more foreign to me.

597
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,545
Even now, I can't get
used to the taste of bean paste,

598
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,199
I can't eat it.

599
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,311
It's been a while, Nurse Yoon.

600
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,618
You're here?
Director is inside.

601
00:39:56,166 --> 00:39:58,210
What did you do last night?

602
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,759
Did you meet President Ahn.

603
00:40:00,879 --> 00:40:01,779
No.

604
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,402
It was a friend's birthday,
so I went to play with my friends.

605
00:40:05,522 --> 00:40:07,438
Is that so?

606
00:40:19,129 --> 00:40:20,528
Did you find it?

607
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:25,330
Here. Nurse Yoon's background.

608
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:29,762
There's nothing special
about her background.

609
00:40:29,882 --> 00:40:32,684
Do you have family certificates,
or special personal information?

610
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:36,882
She was a nurse that was here before I came,
so there were no special requirements.

611
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,953
I think I heard someone
similar to a mother was sick,

612
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:43,052
but I don't know anything else.

613
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:46,271
I have to get a full understanding
of how Nurse Yoon grew up,

614
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,222
in order to get my information.

615
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:50,067
What her family was like,

616
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:52,568
Joo Seung, you help me find out.

617
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,765
I'll investigate President Ahn.

618
00:41:12,334 --> 00:41:14,120
It seems you're really good
at making Korean food.

619
00:41:14,163 --> 00:41:16,262
The taste of the bean paste
is really authentic.

620
00:41:16,382 --> 00:41:19,060
It's fortunate that it's to your taste.

621
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,046
I always hear people tell me that I like Western food,
that I'm suited to live in the Western world,

622
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,883
actually, I'm very Korean.

623
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:35,342
Even though your brother isn't here,
how would you like to start afresh here?

624
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,229
If you wish,

625
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:39,651
I could help you with anything you need.

626
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:44,846
Don't let me have useless hopes.

627
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:48,350
During that period, I was really lonely,

628
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,569
so if you care for me,
I'll be moved uncontrollably.

629
00:41:55,434 --> 00:41:57,677
I asked the secretary to buy
a cake, it must be here.

630
00:41:57,797 --> 00:41:59,501
Eat more.

631
00:42:08,007 --> 00:42:10,729
You're here without contacting
me at all, what's the matter?

632
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,625
I have something urgent to ask you.

633
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:20,199
So I see you have a guest.

634
00:42:22,468 --> 00:42:24,270
President Joo.

635
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:27,938
Ah Ran.

636
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,264
The guest is...

637
00:42:32,727 --> 00:42:34,254
Jae Sung?

638
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:45,121
Jae Sung and Julie Jung,
both of you know each other.

639
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:50,628
I didn't know the two of you had the relationship
where you went to each other's houses for dinner.

640
00:42:51,307 --> 00:42:52,600
That...

641
00:42:57,794 --> 00:42:59,533
President Ahn.

642
00:43:03,072 --> 00:43:06,995
I thought you couldn't eat bean paste,
looks like your tastes have changed.

643
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,731
Or, maybe you lied to me,

644
00:43:10,851 --> 00:43:16,350
or if not, you're someone else.

645
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:20,016
Get out, Ah Ran.

646
00:43:20,673 --> 00:43:22,327
I'll have dinner with you another time.

647
00:43:22,447 --> 00:43:24,023
What is going on?

648
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,648
How do you know President Jung of SM?

649
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:33,849
<i>The two of you, is there a secret deal between
the two of you that I don't know about?</i>

650
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:35,418
What is it?

651
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:36,924
Tell me quickly!

652
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,510
Don't be too excited.

653
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,004
I was just trying to help you.

654
00:43:43,124 --> 00:43:44,213
Liar.

655
00:43:46,397 --> 00:43:48,877
You're working with President Jung,

656
00:43:48,997 --> 00:43:52,351
and planning to put Soul in danger, right?

657
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:55,171
<i>What is your real motive?</i>

658
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,457
Are you hiding something from me?

659
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,536
The last time, didn't Ah Ran say,
the sister of the person who died

660
00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:05,395
because he had a one-sided love
for Ah Ran opened SM Furniture?

661
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:09,344
After I heard that, I thought Ah Ran
was in danger, and felt really bad.

662
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:14,368
So, because of Ah Ran,
I met the President of SM.

663
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:17,181
Are you expecting me to believe that?

664
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:21,761
If you don't believe me,
I can't do anything.

665
00:44:21,881 --> 00:44:24,220
There's only one truth.

666
00:44:25,556 --> 00:44:28,211
<i>Just to get closer with President Jung,</i>

667
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:30,480
I even ate the bean paste
soup that I can't eat,

668
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:32,197
I made quite an effort.

669
00:44:32,727 --> 00:44:35,568
You suspecting me like
this, is rather chilling.

670
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:46,292
Joo Seung, it's me.

671
00:44:46,721 --> 00:44:49,211
Continue watching what
Ahn Jae Sung is doing.

672
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:52,391
It's true that he has a special
relationship with Jung Sang Hwa.

673
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,204
Anyway, I feel like I'm
being kept in the dark.

674
00:44:57,324 --> 00:45:00,905
If there's anything special, contact me.

675
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:14,464
Why are you here?
What if my family sees you?

676
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:17,876
You seem rather anxious
because of Kyeong Ran,

677
00:45:17,996 --> 00:45:20,398
how could we lie around comfortably?

678
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:25,228
That's why, we should work
together to find Kyeong Ran, right?

679
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,433
If you acknowledge our efforts,

680
00:45:27,553 --> 00:45:35,339
then we'll make public the telephone number
of the woman that took Kyeong Ran away.

681
00:45:36,772 --> 00:45:38,171
I understand.

682
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,372
I'll do as you wish,
so tell me.

683
00:45:41,949 --> 00:45:44,430
If it changes, I'll let you know.

684
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:56,183
<i>You clearly promised,</i>

685
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:59,046
<i>don't pretend this didn't
happen after you find Kyeong Ran.</i>

686
00:45:59,166 --> 00:46:01,611
<i>This is the number for our house.</i>

687
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:05,891
<i>Then, the person who took
Kyeong Ran away was Mother?</i>

688
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:09,198
<i>What is the reason Mother
took Kyeong Ran away?</i>

689
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:11,848
<i>That's right.</i>

690
00:46:11,968 --> 00:46:14,326
<i>Mother supports the Angel Orphanage.</i>

691
00:46:14,446 --> 00:46:17,768
<i>Then, our Kyeong Ran
could very well be there.</i>

692
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:21,688
Ah Ran! Where are you going?

693
00:46:23,341 --> 00:46:25,271
I'm really anxious.

694
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:30,402
We shouldn't have given
her such important information.

695
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:37,805
I came, because I have
something important to ask you.

696
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:40,665
Among the children that my
deceased husband was supporting,

697
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:43,146
was there a child called Joo Kyeong Ran?

698
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,245
Joo Kyeong Ran?

699
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:47,605
No, there wasn't.

700
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:49,471
There wasn't?

701
00:46:52,545 --> 00:46:57,888
Then, was there a child, that my mother-in-law
or my husband took special care of?

702
00:46:58,008 --> 00:47:04,664
Madam and her son, helped the entire
orphanage, not just specific children.

703
00:47:05,392 --> 00:47:08,438
But, what is it because of?

704
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:10,905
No, it's fine.

705
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:16,990
The fact that I came here,
please don't tell mother-in-law.

706
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:22,115
If Mother changed the telephone number,

707
00:47:22,235 --> 00:47:25,338
she must know about Kyeong Ran.

708
00:47:26,525 --> 00:47:32,357
But, if I ask about Kyeong Ran,
they'll discover whose daughter I am too.

709
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:42,123
Aunt, it's me.

710
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:45,452
I've found out the telephone number
of the person who took Kyeong Ran away.

711
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:47,445
I'll tell you the number.

712
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:51,028
You have to find Kyeong Ran. You must.

713
00:47:59,657 --> 00:48:01,607
Hello, this is Peng Chang Dong.

714
00:48:01,952 --> 00:48:03,669
Peng Chang Dong.

715
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,874
This family is in Peng Chang Dong too.

716
00:48:05,994 --> 00:48:07,910
Give it to me, give it to me.

717
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:09,818
Hello

718
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,944
Have you been living well?

719
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:16,866
I'm Kyeong Ran's aunt, the person
who contacted you before.

720
00:48:16,986 --> 00:48:20,909
Ah, how could you change
your number like that,

721
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,284
did you think we wouldn't find it?

722
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:24,323
What?

723
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:29,517
Just to cut things short,
hurry and bring us our niece.

724
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:31,897
Trying to find our your address now,

725
00:48:32,017 --> 00:48:35,035
is as easy as eating
cooled abalone porridge.

726
00:48:35,155 --> 00:48:36,983
And you,

727
00:48:37,023 --> 00:48:42,728
do you want to be arrested for kidnapping,
and have it printed in the newspapers?

728
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:45,873
Don't be shocked.

729
00:48:45,993 --> 00:48:51,145
Let's meet and talk about it.

730
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:53,728
All right.

731
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:57,735
Tell me the meeting place
and time, and I'll be there.

732
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,848
And, please don't call this number again,

733
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:05,981
I hope only you and I
know about this matter.

734
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:08,334
<i>Mom.</i>

735
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,659
Why are you back at this time?

736
00:49:12,779 --> 00:49:14,699
I forgot to get something.

737
00:49:15,971 --> 00:49:17,879
You don't look too good.

738
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:20,041
Did something happen?

739
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,215
<i>There were two strange people at
the house, they were looking around.</i>

740
00:49:26,335 --> 00:49:27,847
What?

741
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:30,922
Shut the door tight, and
don't open it to anyone.

742
00:49:31,706 --> 00:49:34,272
<i>Patient Shin Hyun Woo
regained his consciousness,</i>

743
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,908
<i>for a short time at Yang Pyeong villa.</i>

744
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:46,892
Why did Mother take Kyeong Ran away?

745
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:52,075
To us, who had already lost our parents,

746
00:49:52,195 --> 00:49:54,874
what was she trying to do?

747
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:58,213
Could it be,

748
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:03,470
that when Father's crimes were discovered,

749
00:50:04,282 --> 00:50:07,080
she was going to use Kyeong Ran as a shield?

750
00:50:12,648 --> 00:50:14,297
It's me, Joo Seung.

751
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:16,523
Did you find something out?

752
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:19,534
What?

753
00:50:21,295 --> 00:50:23,055
Ahn Jae Sung is...

754
00:50:24,306 --> 00:50:27,020
at the paper dolls convention right now?

755
00:51:41,517 --> 00:51:42,683
Hyun Woo.

756
00:51:51,506 --> 00:51:52,863
Ah Ran.

757
00:51:55,924 --> 00:51:57,705
Why are you so scared?

758
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,200
It's like someone found out
something they shouldn't have.

759
00:52:04,701 --> 00:52:06,567
It's just such a coincidence.

760
00:52:06,894 --> 00:52:09,714
I didn't expect to see Ah Ran here.

761
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:13,318
But, just now, did you
just call me Hyun Woo?

762
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:17,472
Looking at the way you were making
the paper dolls, reminded me of Hyun Woo.

763
00:52:18,532 --> 00:52:22,306
My husband used to love
making paper dolls too.

764
00:52:23,472 --> 00:52:26,271
<i>That's why I thought about
the past and came in to take a look.</i>

765
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:28,863
I didn't expect to see Jae Sung here.

766
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:30,814
Is that so.

767
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:33,846
Looks like Shin Hyun Woo
has special hobbies.

768
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:37,090
But, I didn't expect that Jae Sung
would have the same interests.

769
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:39,388
Why didn't you say anything?

770
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:42,441
That you liked paper dolls?

771
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:57,201
<i>You are really skilled.</i>

772
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:03,439
The expressions, the color,
is really similar to my husband's.

773
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,534
<i>Especially,</i>

774
00:53:07,446 --> 00:53:09,693
giving the dolls blush too.

775
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:12,370
<i>My dolls have blush on their face.</i>

776
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,596
<i>That's Shin Hyun Woo's
trademark on his paper dolls.</i>

777
00:53:14,716 --> 00:53:16,547
<i>Don't forget it.</i>

778
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:24,131
How could that be?

779
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:26,781
I haven't learnt the skill for very long.

780
00:53:26,901 --> 00:53:32,223
I was actually going to keep it a secret,
till I made some for Ah Ran as a present.

781
00:53:32,828 --> 00:53:34,449
Is that so?

782
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:39,092
In that case, today's a really strange day.

783
00:53:39,786 --> 00:53:42,902
I found the paper dolls
that you were hiding from me,

784
00:53:43,022 --> 00:53:46,210
<i>and I also saw you meeting President Jung,
that you said was for my sake.</i>

785
00:53:46,867 --> 00:53:49,623
Other than this,
is there something else I don't know?

786
00:53:56,667 --> 00:53:59,355
Let's go and have fun today,

787
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:02,599
just like I always wanted
to do with Jae Sung.

788
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:04,719
Do you have time?

789
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,796
<i>My deceased husband,</i>

790
00:54:22,771 --> 00:54:27,436
even though he was a good and kind man,
but he was terrible at sports.

791
00:54:29,187 --> 00:54:31,381
He hated riding horses,

792
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,364
and was terrible at swimming and the rest.

793
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:39,474
But Jae Sung is great at
every sport, I like that.

794
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:43,299
How about a bungee jump?

795
00:54:44,338 --> 00:54:46,861
I don't know,
I've never done it before.

796
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,281
Really?

797
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:50,020
What a coincidence.

798
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:56,205
You couldn't be afraid of heights,
just like my ex-husband, right.

799
00:54:56,325 --> 00:54:59,449
<i>Joo Ah Ran is suspecting me.</i>

800
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:01,656
<i>I have to be more careful.</i>

801
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:04,730
<i>The decisive factor has been discovered.</i>

802
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,825
<i>If she knows I have a fear of heights,</i>

803
00:55:07,945 --> 00:55:11,069
<i>she'll decide that I'm Shin Hyun Woo.</i>

804
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:15,502
Why?

805
00:55:15,622 --> 00:55:18,089
Do you not have confidence?

806
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:23,599
No, it should be quite interesting.

807
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,964
I was just thinking of giving it a shot.

808
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,134
<i>The aftereffects of the plastic surgery
on your entire body is very severe.</i>

809
00:55:53,254 --> 00:55:57,417
<i>Your heart is getting weaker, unreasonably
working out is also very dangerous.</i>

810
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,099
That's right,

811
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:28,799
even if my heart bursts here, I can never
be that embarrassing Shin Hyun Woo again.

812
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:32,579
Because the life that already
died in Joo Ah Ran's hands,

813
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:36,035
can never be revived again.

814
00:56:36,904 --> 00:56:39,766
Show me the evidence that
you are not Shin Hyun Woo.

815
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,963
If you're really Ahn Jae Sung,
you have nothing to be afraid of.

816
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:50,184
Your destruction is right in front of you,

817
00:56:50,304 --> 00:56:52,728
you can't give up here.

818
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:56,142
Taking everything you own,

819
00:56:56,842 --> 00:56:59,759
and justly bringing you
to the judgment table,

820
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:01,767
what is betrayal,

821
00:57:01,887 --> 00:57:04,530
what is fear of death,

822
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:06,692
I have to show that to you.

823
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:11,424
Even if you're Shin Hyun Woo,
there's nothing to be afraid of either.

824
00:57:12,484 --> 00:57:15,113
Cowardly hiding and watching
for your opportunities,

825
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:18,421
you'll get eaten by the snake eventually.

826
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,916
Now the knife is in mine
and Joo Seung's hands,

827
00:57:23,828 --> 00:57:25,821
what are you hesitating for?

828
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,814
Hurry and jump!

829
00:57:29,086 --> 00:57:30,464
<i>All right.</i>

830
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:33,390
<i>I'll try it.</i>

831
00:57:33,856 --> 00:57:35,976
<i>Jump.</i>

832
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:18,000
He jumped.

833
00:58:20,672 --> 00:58:24,770
Shin Hyun Woo,
could definitely not do that.

834
00:58:27,845 --> 00:58:31,449
Even if he changed his face and his voice,

835
00:58:32,393 --> 00:58:35,722
he could not change his fear of heights too.

836
00:58:37,057 --> 00:58:38,478
Then...

837
00:58:39,241 --> 00:58:41,128
this person...

838
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:49,237
You were really as cool as
I thought you would be.

839
00:58:49,357 --> 00:58:51,612
Did you not tremble at all?

840
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:56,340
I wasn't trembling because I was scared,
but I was trembling because Ah Ran was watching.

841
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,797
It's a relief you thought it was cool.

842
00:58:58,917 --> 00:59:00,939
Hold on.

843
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:21,312
<i>Did you go to the paper doll convention?</i>

844
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,747
<i>This can prove that Ahn Jae Sung
is not a person of this world.</i>

845
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:28,500
<i>Before Hyun Woo Hyung carries out his plan,
we have to think up an idea first.</i>

846
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:44,346
Thank you.

847
00:59:48,035 --> 00:59:49,116
I,

848
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:53,950
even though I really like Jae Sung,

849
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:58,655
I can't tolerate the feeling
of three people being together.

850
00:59:58,775 --> 01:00:01,199
Are you still meeting Yoon Jae Hee?

851
01:00:02,534 --> 01:00:04,485
You love me,

852
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:07,468
and you love Yoon Jae Hee too?

853
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,779
How can it be?

854
01:00:09,899 --> 01:00:13,466
It's because she's a kind-hearted woman,
and I don't want to hurt her.

855
01:00:13,586 --> 01:00:17,304
I'll take care of it slowly, don't worry.

856
01:00:17,424 --> 01:00:19,424
That taking care of it,

857
01:00:20,062 --> 01:00:22,288
could I help you do it?

858
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:26,252
If you were sincere to me,

859
01:00:27,609 --> 01:00:29,708
<i>give me that ring.</i>

860
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:33,539
<i>even if someone maligns you,
speaks evil of you,</i>

861
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,309
I'll believe in Jae Sung's heart,
and walk till the end with you.

862
01:00:50,922 --> 01:00:53,339
Even though I'm not wearing
it for its significance,

863
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:55,884
if Ah Ran wants it,

864
01:00:57,214 --> 01:00:58,892
there you go.

865
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:14,921
Is there a Yoon Jae Hee here?

866
01:01:15,041 --> 01:01:16,468
Yes, that's me.

867
01:01:16,526 --> 01:01:19,352
Joo Ah Ran,
sent this to you.

868
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,830
This...

869
01:01:31,339 --> 01:01:33,671
this is our couple ring.

870
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:42,099
<i>This is President Ahn's heart,
stop clinging on to him.</i>

871
01:01:48,886 --> 01:01:52,342
Ahjussi, it can't be, right?

872
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:56,031
It can't be that Ahjussi
sent the ring back.

873
01:01:57,182 --> 01:01:59,599
It can't be.

874
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:03,861
No matter how tiring it is,
he promised he wouldn't give it up.

875
01:02:06,434 --> 01:02:08,300
<i>This ring, is a magic ring.</i>

876
01:02:11,713 --> 01:02:14,342
Oh my, how did you do that?

877
01:02:14,462 --> 01:02:16,503
It attracts when it gets
close by, I designed it.

878
01:02:16,623 --> 01:02:18,750
Just like you and I.

879
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,127
What is with Doctor Nam?

880
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:20,056
<i>You have nothing to do with our family.</i>

881
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:22,601
<i>I have something to tell you,</i>

882
01:03:23,152 --> 01:03:24,954
<i>I'll arrive at 7.</i>

883
01:03:32,597 --> 01:03:35,522
I came because you didn't
pick up your phone.

884
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:38,793
What is with this ring?

885
01:03:38,913 --> 01:03:40,680
Ahjussi didn't take it off, right?

886
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:45,415
You lost it, or maybe Joo Ah Ran stole it, right?

887
01:03:55,078 --> 01:03:56,689
Let's just call it quits.

888
01:03:57,961 --> 01:03:59,127
What?

889
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,795
That ring, I took it off myself.

890
01:04:05,761 --> 01:04:08,941
During this time, I wasn't
sincere to you, sorry.

891
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:12,418
Today, I'm showing you my real heart.

892
01:04:14,204 --> 01:04:17,851
My explanation is done, please go home.

893
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:21,457
Ahjussi, ahjussi!

894
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:26,397
Ahjussi.

895
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,883
What's wrong?

896
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:31,406
Why are you treating me this way?

897
01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:35,562
I'm really tired too.

898
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:39,196
Please stop it.

899
01:04:39,748 --> 01:04:43,458
Please open the door and
tell me, this is a joke.

900
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:14,995
Jae Sung is colder than
I thought he would be.

901
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:17,602
Nurse Yoon must be really hurt now.

902
01:05:20,118 --> 01:05:23,109
Now that I've verified Jae Sung's heart,

903
01:05:23,229 --> 01:05:26,035
I won't have suspicions with no basis.

904
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:29,983
The table has been set.

905
01:05:50,829 --> 01:05:52,080
Ah Ran.

906
01:05:53,904 --> 01:05:57,465
Marry me.

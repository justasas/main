1
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:14,486
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

2
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,895
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,030
I'll be right behind the wall

4
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:33,675
In 370BC, the Warring States China

5
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,774
Zhao Nation dispatched 100,000 warriors

6
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:38,718
led by Xiang Yanzhong, to attack Yan Nation

7
00:00:38,754 --> 00:00:40,984
LIANG stands right on his path to Yan

8
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,890
There's no way she can
resist Zhao's mighty troop

9
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:46,291
and will be definitely taken as buffer

10
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,461
Their only chance for survival is to

11
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:50,897
ask for the help of Mozi warrior

12
00:00:50,932 --> 00:00:53,662
who are experts in defending

13
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:55,633
but...

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,800
as Liang teeters on the edge of peril

15
00:00:59,841 --> 00:01:01,706
Mozi warriors...

16
00:01:01,743 --> 00:01:03,643
still didn't arrive

17
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:17,455
Father, we must fight

18
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,060
Zhao's Commander
Xiang Yanzhong is a brilliant strategist

19
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:27,467
His advance troop has already arrived

20
00:01:27,502 --> 00:01:29,766
We have to take action now

21
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:33,138
before the arrival of their main force

22
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:35,575
we must surrender

23
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,603
otherwise, we're all done for

24
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,445
Fighting with bare hands...

25
00:01:47,155 --> 00:01:48,747
ends up the same...

26
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:50,685
My Lord

27
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:54,426
My Lord

28
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:58,763
what if the Mozi army were to make it here?

29
00:02:02,871 --> 00:02:05,203
Assemble at the Gate, quick

30
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,174
Get the horses ready

31
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:08,642
Move on, quick

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,211
Hurry up

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,885
Come on, hurry up

34
00:02:24,192 --> 00:02:25,591
Cavalry Chief

35
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,390
Who told you to ride out?

36
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,657
Your Majesty's decree

37
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:30,756
All cavaliers await at the South Gate

38
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,391
for General Niu's order

39
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:36,628
General, the surrender notes
and cavaliers are ready

40
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,832
Open the Gate

41
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:10,235
Open the Gate

42
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:44,071
Someone's approaching from the West

43
00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:03,421
Who are you?

44
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:10,126
Mozi, Ge Li

45
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:13,692
Mozi has finally arrived

46
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:20,672
Open the Gate

47
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,075
Open the Gate

48
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:34,215
Take this

49
00:04:35,123 --> 00:04:36,681
Zhao soldiers... they're here

50
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,437
Zhao's hostile force

51
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:57,073
They're furious, shall we inform the King?

52
00:05:04,753 --> 00:05:05,947
Who are you?

53
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:09,081
How dare you trespasses on our camp site

54
00:05:09,124 --> 00:05:12,389
This is General Niu of LIANG

55
00:05:13,662 --> 00:05:17,098
I'm here to deliver the surrender note

56
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:27,907
Send cavaliers to pass them
our surrender decision

57
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:28,909
Yes

58
00:05:40,989 --> 00:05:42,513
Attack

59
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:53,098
You think surrendering and not fighting

60
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:54,965
can please the Zhao?

61
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:57,062
And stop the war?

62
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:58,470
Zhao's army is huge

63
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:01,134
you want us all to get killed?

64
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:19,288
When they take over Liang,
you'll still have to suffer

65
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:21,221
Ministers will be killed

66
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:27,568
soldiers will be captured

67
00:06:29,404 --> 00:06:31,929
your families will be ruined

68
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,809
women will be dishonored

69
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,473
Why?

70
00:06:39,514 --> 00:06:42,244
Are you contented with this?

71
00:06:44,152 --> 00:06:46,746
Why don't you give a try?

72
00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:48,886
Though...

73
00:06:49,758 --> 00:06:51,191
we may die in the battle

74
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,619
but at least you'd tried

75
00:06:54,662 --> 00:06:56,289
and if we can make it

76
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:59,061
we'll make it worth

77
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,431
We can't give up our homeland

78
00:07:00,468 --> 00:07:01,765
What shall we do then?

79
00:07:01,803 --> 00:07:02,895
Sir, please lead us to defend

80
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:06,532
Yes, lead us

81
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:10,472
Take action now, Mozi

82
00:07:10,512 --> 00:07:13,413
Zhao army is already here

83
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:59,221
Can you give me your bow?

84
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,921
Their distance is too far

85
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,361
Give me

86
00:08:17,512 --> 00:08:20,538
To fight or surrender?

87
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:26,251
No one is allowed to intrude into my city

88
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,609
Protect the General

89
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:02,749
General Gao...

90
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:07,490
General Wei commanded us to retreat?

91
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,826
Retreat

92
00:09:11,866 --> 00:09:13,094
Thank you

93
00:09:13,134 --> 00:09:16,126
Good job, they'd retreated

94
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,331
They are only the vanguard troop

95
00:09:18,373 --> 00:09:20,136
It's just the beginning

96
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,309
Retreat

97
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:32,686
Your majesty

98
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,744
Proceed

99
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:38,818
A Mozi arrived and
drove away the Zhao's vanguard

100
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,020
Congratulations, My Lord

101
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:43,428
Liang is saved

102
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,603
Nonsense

103
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,311
My Lord, please take care

104
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:06,947
My Lord...

105
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:09,186
My Lord...

106
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,351
Your Honor, the King was drunk

107
00:10:20,935 --> 00:10:22,732
Back off, the Prince is coming

108
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,738
Come on, good boy

109
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,350
The King is not feeling well

110
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,247
your request had to be put back later

111
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:43,922
Enemies are right outside,
we don't have much time

112
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:45,550
By the way

113
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:47,754
which cities have you protected before?

114
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:52,998
This is my first time

115
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,393
You are the only one they sent?

116
00:10:56,838 --> 00:11:00,205
How about the jade pendant?

117
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:03,273
Did you bring it?

118
00:11:03,311 --> 00:11:05,006
It's still in the Mozi Hall

119
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,543
It was our token for Mozi's help

120
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:11,552
How can you forget?

121
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,718
Let me have a look

122
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,653
General Wei

123
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:16,281
why...

124
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,422
Just a little modification...

125
00:11:20,428 --> 00:11:23,454
and double the shooting range

126
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:27,659
Why do you stop my attack?

127
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:29,602
What for?

128
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,867
We don't need to attack

129
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:35,374
Liang had already sent someone here to surrender

130
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:40,375
Then, why are they shooting me?

131
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,076
Give out my order

132
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,821
block off all the paths to Liang

133
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:51,416
poison all its water source.

134
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,860
No one is to go near Liang without my order

135
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:56,386
Yes

136
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,592
That just...

137
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,726
gives them time to defend

138
00:12:04,806 --> 00:12:06,865
Don't worry

139
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:09,775
we'll discuss when the Commander arrives

140
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:13,307
Sir, Prince Liang Shi offered...

141
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:19,049
you to rest here for the night

142
00:12:20,655 --> 00:12:22,179
Thank you

143
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:46,139
Thank you

144
00:13:02,897 --> 00:13:04,159
Cavalry Chief

145
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:15,665
Who did the arrangement?
He's here to protect us

146
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,642
It's the Prince's order...

147
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:18,144
The Prince? How can he...

148
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:32,792
My Prince was convinced by an outsider

149
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:36,820
and stimulated the Zhao's vanguard

150
00:13:36,864 --> 00:13:39,492
They will definitely retaliate.

151
00:13:39,534 --> 00:13:41,502
I'm sure your majesty understands

152
00:13:42,537 --> 00:13:45,870
What is your suggestion?

153
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:49,940
Your servant believes that...

154
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:53,504
Don't hesitate? Say it.

155
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,512
Ge Li persuaded the people

156
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:03,718
and offended the Zhao against your decree

157
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,158
We must arrest Ge Li

158
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:08,355
and hand him over to the Zhao

159
00:14:08,396 --> 00:14:11,695
That will placate them

160
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:15,224
and show My Lord's sincerity

161
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,103
If Xiang Yanzhong and his troops arrive

162
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,166
Liang will be in great danger

163
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:27,371
Royal Tutor wants me to...

164
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:29,747
turn against the Mozi?

165
00:14:30,284 --> 00:14:31,581
My Lord

166
00:14:32,186 --> 00:14:36,122
this is the only way to save Liang

167
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:40,924
What about the Mozi?

168
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,055
They would be furious

169
00:14:43,764 --> 00:14:48,827
Ge Li didn't bring the pendant you sent

170
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:52,169
his identity is unclear

171
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,005
My Lord

172
00:14:56,043 --> 00:14:57,408
Proceed

173
00:14:57,445 --> 00:15:00,243
The Prince came to see
your majesty with Mozi Ge Li

174
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:07,252
Bring Ge Li to the Main Hall alone

175
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:08,516
Yes

176
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:21,663
Long live My Lord

177
00:15:36,217 --> 00:15:37,343
Ge Li

178
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:38,409
Yes

179
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:42,286
I've heard that you've never lead troops

180
00:15:42,323 --> 00:15:45,383
or protect a city before

181
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:49,690
Facing Xiang Yanzhong's force

182
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,724
how will you save Liang?

183
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,932
Zhao's target is Yan Nation

184
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:02,238
they won't risk their mission on Liang

185
00:16:02,276 --> 00:16:06,337
The battle with Liang must be fast and clear

186
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:08,814
Survival or not

187
00:16:08,849 --> 00:16:11,909
depends on how long Liang can hold

188
00:16:11,953 --> 00:16:14,854
How long will it take to repel the Zhao?

189
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:20,953
If Liang can hold up to one month,
Zhao will retreat

190
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,666
Ge Li

191
00:16:26,534 --> 00:16:29,059
You think...

192
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,037
how long can Liang hold?

193
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:34,974
That's up to your trust on me

194
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:37,500
I trust you unquestionably

195
00:16:37,545 --> 00:16:38,807
Then, I urged you to

196
00:16:38,846 --> 00:16:41,679
hand over all command to Ge Li

197
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:47,009
The utmost care must be taken

198
00:16:47,054 --> 00:16:49,249
orders must be clear & strict

199
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,520
efficiency is most important

200
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:55,959
Right

201
00:16:58,132 --> 00:17:01,795
Right

202
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:06,633
It seems that...

203
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:10,906
Liang is going for a long siege

204
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:12,977
Yes

205
00:17:13,014 --> 00:17:16,177
But what if...

206
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:21,450
...I mean if you were killed?

207
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,151
What else can we do?

208
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:26,315
How about...

209
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,057
not fighting?

210
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:36,769
Not to fight?

211
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:38,328
Right

212
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,340
That's all on your will

213
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,640
My will is strong for that

214
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,884
Then tie up Ge Li now

215
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:59,426
let Prince Liang Shi...

216
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,662
bring him to the Zhao

217
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:07,027
That will stop the war

218
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:12,001
You can bring along your families

219
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:14,599
go to Zhao Nation

220
00:18:14,642 --> 00:18:17,304
and plead for forgiveness

221
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,082
You then hand over Liang to the Zhao

222
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:29,856
All men will become slaves

223
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:30,822
Then...

224
00:18:30,858 --> 00:18:35,261
the people of Liang will suffer no war

225
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:40,056
If your majesty prefers this

226
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,935
Fine, Ge Li will do all he can

227
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:45,438
Please

228
00:19:34,221 --> 00:19:36,052
The king sees his people as everything

229
00:19:37,258 --> 00:19:40,591
My decision is... at all costs

230
00:19:41,362 --> 00:19:43,330
Liang Shi

231
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:46,530
Yes

232
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:52,331
You must obey Ge Li's command

233
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:54,500
Apart from the Royal guards

234
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:58,410
Mozi Ge Li will command all troops

235
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:01,346
to resist Zhao's invasion

236
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:06,046
Anyone who disobeys his orders will be...

237
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:07,678
be-headed

238
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:15,251
Our enemy will poison our water source

239
00:20:15,763 --> 00:20:17,321
from now on

240
00:20:17,364 --> 00:20:21,266
we must not use any water flowing into Liang

241
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:25,636
We'll have to dig more wells in the city

242
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:29,837
Collect farmer's harvest

243
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:31,845
select several locations in the city

244
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:33,540
as food storages

245
00:20:33,581 --> 00:20:36,414
All food and water will be under distribution

246
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,509
Direct all water drainage

247
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:41,487
to the farmland and let it swamp

248
00:20:41,522 --> 00:20:43,649
Swamp the farmland?

249
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:45,955
We'll starve ourselves of food

250
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:48,518
With appropriate allocation

251
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:51,622
our coffers will last us for a year

252
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:53,599
Then what?

253
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,602
We'll have kept the city

254
00:20:56,537 --> 00:20:58,528
but there'll be nothing left

255
00:20:58,572 --> 00:21:02,941
If we lose our lives,
what good will come of that?

256
00:21:02,977 --> 00:21:04,342
Even if we block off the East

257
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:07,074
enemies will attack us from other directions

258
00:21:08,816 --> 00:21:11,614
The west and north give us natural barriers

259
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:14,086
Enemies will not attack from those directions

260
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:16,282
How about the south?

261
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:17,813
Why don't we spend more effort on it?

262
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:21,259
Every city must have one weakness

263
00:21:21,295 --> 00:21:25,732
this is where our enemies will attack

264
00:21:25,766 --> 00:21:28,132
so as to control their attack

265
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:31,503
Gather all the strong men

266
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:36,601
we've to build a bulwark
at the south in seven days

267
00:21:37,344 --> 00:21:40,609
Can that be done?

268
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:41,637
Mr. Ge Li

269
00:21:41,682 --> 00:21:44,048
how can we build a bulwark in such a short time?

270
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:45,608
It would take at least a year

271
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:48,349
to bring the stones from the mountain

272
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,358
Knocking down the palace wall?

273
00:21:52,393 --> 00:21:54,623
How can you protect the palace?

274
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:56,186
Are you revolting?

275
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:04,867
These stones are for building a bulwark

276
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:07,267
The bulwark

277
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,276
is our first line of defense

278
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:14,114
If we lose the city

279
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:16,776
the palace will be lost too

280
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:20,651
Protecting the city means protecting the palace

281
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:23,020
Ge Li

282
00:22:23,057 --> 00:22:26,584
can a bulwark built in such a short tim

283
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:30,028
defend Xiang Yanzhong's troop?

284
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:33,329
To defend Liang in such a way...

285
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,494
This is not only defending

286
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:40,337
it's also a psychological tactic

287
00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:46,837
The bulwark has to be built precisely

288
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,144
matching with the main wall

289
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:51,583
The efficiency of the Liang people

290
00:22:51,618 --> 00:22:55,247
will definitely threaten our enemies

291
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:03,092
Your highness

292
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,963
please allow cavalry to
help with moving the stones

293
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:07,933
to speed up the process

294
00:23:08,569 --> 00:23:11,265
Cavalry troops represent
the superiority of Liang

295
00:23:11,305 --> 00:23:14,638
how can they be used to move stones?

296
00:23:18,178 --> 00:23:19,406
I believe that...

297
00:23:19,446 --> 00:23:21,539
this may prove My Lord's love

298
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,050
and care for his people

299
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:25,881
Right

300
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:30,689
With their help, seven days will be enough

301
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:50,606
Unload and move on quickly

302
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:52,736
The sun rises in this direction

303
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,647
Sunlight will be the strongest after 3 hours

304
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,883
Move back

305
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,190
There's drinking water outside the Gate

306
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,062
Go by the side

307
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,505
Move on quickly

308
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,275
Record the landscape

309
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:25,471
Yes

310
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:28,846
Let's go the stream

311
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:30,179
Go

312
00:25:00,514 --> 00:25:04,211
What a disgrace, never-ending warfare

313
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,151
There's war everywhere

314
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:09,451
I don't want to run anymore

315
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:11,617
You want to die here?

316
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:13,990
That Mozi looks quite capable

317
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,052
maybe Liang can hold

318
00:25:16,096 --> 00:25:18,690
Why don't we just give them the city?

319
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:21,166
Who cares who we pay tax to?

320
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,327
Quiet...

321
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:25,668
Quick, unload these alcohols

322
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:27,173
Yes...

323
00:25:57,971 --> 00:25:59,768
Cai Qiu...

324
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:11,083
Don't go

325
00:26:11,652 --> 00:26:14,382
Come back

326
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,654
Just let the baby cry...

327
00:26:49,156 --> 00:26:51,090
Be quiet

328
00:26:51,124 --> 00:26:52,421
What is it?

329
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:54,256
Zhao troops arrived

330
00:26:54,294 --> 00:26:56,057
Don't let the baby cry

331
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:57,085
Keep quiet

332
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,960
Don't let her cry

333
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,693
- Let me hug her
- Give her to me

334
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,291
Don't hurt the child

335
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:03,166
Stop the crying

336
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:05,433
Let me hug her

337
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:08,803
Don't let the baby cry

338
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:11,811
Give her to me

339
00:27:11,845 --> 00:27:14,712
Give her the child

340
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:16,682
Stop her crying and keep quiet

341
00:27:16,717 --> 00:27:17,706
sister...

342
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:19,685
My child

343
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,278
My child

344
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:22,515
Shut up

345
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:24,023
We are all going to die

346
00:27:24,057 --> 00:27:25,581
Stop crying

347
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:36,763
You flee because you don't want to fight

348
00:27:37,604 --> 00:27:39,902
we're also tired of killing

349
00:27:40,741 --> 00:27:42,572
We're heading to Yan Nation

350
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:45,442
and just bypassing Liang for supplies

351
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:48,107
How come Liang confused our purpose?

352
00:27:48,782 --> 00:27:51,307
Is there someone persuading you?

353
00:27:52,953 --> 00:27:54,818
A Mozi came...

354
00:27:55,422 --> 00:27:56,787
his name is Geli...

355
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,188
Only one?

356
00:27:59,326 --> 00:28:03,820
4,000 people persuaded by one person

357
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:06,731
to fight against 100,000 soldiers?

358
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:09,491
We dare not

359
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:16,039
Leaders must earn their respect

360
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:20,204
Zi Tuan, you'll lead the archers

361
00:28:21,448 --> 00:28:23,211
Will you take the command?

362
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:27,544
Why don't you take Ge Li's order?

363
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,318
How dare you

364
00:28:31,358 --> 00:28:34,327
Your skill and experience is not up to mine

365
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,852
how can you be the leader?

366
00:28:36,897 --> 00:28:38,956
You're not qualified and hiding the truth

367
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,928
Guards

368
00:28:41,768 --> 00:28:42,598
Take him

369
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:44,069
No

370
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,366
Stop

371
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:54,275
Not up to the Prince's skill
will had to be imprisoned

372
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:56,942
I should be taken too

373
00:29:00,253 --> 00:29:03,279
Leaders must earn their respect

374
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,223
Zi Tuan is not qualified

375
00:29:05,258 --> 00:29:06,782
Zi Tuan's archery

376
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:08,988
had amazed me on the day I arrive Liang

377
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:12,988
Warfare is a matter of
strategies and cooperation

378
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:16,434
no single man can ever hold off an army

379
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:17,960
Right

380
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:22,804
For military tactics

381
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:28,179
we can only judge
when the enemy is at our doorstep

382
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:33,551
But for archery, let's settle it right now

383
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:43,595
the top of that pole is the target

384
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,894
you each have five shots

385
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,093
You start first

386
00:29:57,511 --> 00:30:01,675
Quit now and I can spare your life

387
00:30:03,784 --> 00:30:05,217
Please start

388
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,284
Even if you made it, you'll never beat me

389
00:30:47,327 --> 00:30:48,487
You lose

390
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:50,587
Guards, take him

391
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,766
Wait

392
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:28,263
You're the best archer

393
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,633
best rider, and best fighter

394
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,264
all because you're the Prince of Liang

395
00:31:35,308 --> 00:31:37,071
You should widen your scope

396
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:41,076
the world is bigger than you think

397
00:31:45,986 --> 00:31:47,453
What's going on?

398
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:49,318
They're beating up those who tried to escape

399
00:31:52,425 --> 00:31:54,689
I dare not run again

400
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:04,495
Please stop, please

401
00:32:12,712 --> 00:32:15,704
Do you remember the location of Zhao camp?

402
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:18,775
We don't know

403
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,485
When we saw the Zhao's sentry

404
00:32:23,523 --> 00:32:25,047
we just turn and run

405
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:30,826
Sir, Zhao's Commander Xiang Yanzhong

406
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:32,798
wants to meet with you at the South Gate

407
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:07,894
War on a board game?

408
00:33:07,934 --> 00:33:11,199
So we know where we stand

409
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:12,363
Please

410
00:33:17,177 --> 00:33:18,075
Please

411
00:33:41,768 --> 00:33:43,235
Commander

412
00:33:51,277 --> 00:33:54,371
Just to check you out

413
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:56,382
you certainly are a fine catch

414
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:02,179
Small defeat means nothing,
it's just a board game

415
00:34:04,424 --> 00:34:06,756
It isn't worth

416
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:10,354
wasting Commander's time on Liang

417
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,694
right?

418
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:14,764
It won't cost much

419
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:19,566
I'm not done yet

420
00:34:22,342 --> 00:34:24,139
Neither am I

421
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:30,012
See you in the battlefield

422
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,258
General

423
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:43,560
Thank you, My Lord

424
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:54,502
I'd changed my words in surrendering

425
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:58,568
and I'd hand over all commands to Ge Li

426
00:34:58,611 --> 00:35:01,205
General, I hope you won't take offence...

427
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:02,646
My Lord, I really don't mind

428
00:35:04,684 --> 00:35:06,311
General...

429
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:07,910
Your servant is loyal to your majesty

430
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:10,923
I'm always at your command

431
00:35:13,726 --> 00:35:16,024
I appreciate your generalship

432
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,198
and your understanding

433
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:27,363
General Niu, you're always my great General

434
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:30,342
This battle is critical for Liang

435
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:35,637
If we can defend Zhao's first attack

436
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:37,912
Liang will have hope

437
00:35:38,785 --> 00:35:39,717
Any questions?

438
00:35:39,752 --> 00:35:41,117
No

439
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,121
We'll get everything ready

440
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:44,180
So, dismiss and prepare for the battle

441
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:45,486
Yes

442
00:35:47,393 --> 00:35:49,520
Sir...

443
00:35:49,562 --> 00:35:51,962
Mr. Ge Li...

444
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:53,855
What is it?

445
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,959
Cavalry troop is not yet assigned with any work

446
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:59,128
Cavalry troops belong to the royal guards

447
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:00,605
I've no rights to command

448
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,005
Don't argue anymore

449
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,435
Usually...

450
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:10,977
People flee from war

451
00:36:12,218 --> 00:36:15,051
do you really know what war is?

452
00:36:15,088 --> 00:36:17,113
This is my homeland

453
00:36:17,157 --> 00:36:19,717
When my father was still alive

454
00:36:19,759 --> 00:36:21,852
he was always on the front line

455
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:23,419
I don't want to be despised

456
00:36:23,463 --> 00:36:25,988
just because I'm a girl...

457
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:32,930
There's one very important job...

458
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,240
You're responsible for the square

459
00:36:42,282 --> 00:36:45,183
Collect them to the City East for distribution

460
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:48,210
We don't have much time, the rest come with me

461
00:36:48,254 --> 00:36:49,380
Yes

462
00:36:55,895 --> 00:36:57,988
Wake up, everybody

463
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:00,226
By the command of Mr. Ge Li

464
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:03,394
give us all your excrement now

465
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:05,427
give us all your excrement

466
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:06,904
I can't take this anymore

467
00:37:08,241 --> 00:37:10,402
I'm really cracked up

468
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,213
The Zhaos...

469
00:37:15,248 --> 00:37:18,877
when will they attack?

470
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,625
Are they... waiting for us?

471
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,367
That's impossible

472
00:37:39,405 --> 00:37:42,806
Ge Li is no dummy...

473
00:37:42,842 --> 00:37:44,207
We've to think it through

474
00:37:44,244 --> 00:37:45,973
We can't wait anymore

475
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:48,412
They'll really kill them all

476
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:54,451
Don't you know our wives
and kids will all be dead?

477
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:56,148
Quiet

478
00:37:56,189 --> 00:37:59,056
We're here all because of your wife...

479
00:37:59,092 --> 00:38:00,684
Forget it... it's over already...

480
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,388
it's over

481
00:38:05,865 --> 00:38:12,395
...I killed my own child, he is still in...

482
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:13,666
It's over already

483
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,338
Everybody get up

484
00:38:17,176 --> 00:38:18,768
and follow me out

485
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:19,971
What's going on here?

486
00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:21,947
- What is it?
- Get up! Quick

487
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:24,273
Keep quiet

488
00:38:24,317 --> 00:38:25,375
Quiet

489
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:26,851
What's going on here?

490
00:38:26,886 --> 00:38:29,616
You... shut up

491
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:32,022
For no matter what reasons you're here

492
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:34,026
from now on

493
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:37,627
no one will care

494
00:38:37,997 --> 00:38:40,329
You'll be sent to the front line of the battle

495
00:38:40,366 --> 00:38:42,926
to fight against your enemies

496
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:44,729
Defeat your enemies

497
00:38:45,538 --> 00:38:47,062
and you'll be freed

498
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:48,437
We're innocent

499
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,203
why do we have to give our lives?

500
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:53,940
Who are not victims in a war?
Answer me

501
00:39:00,753 --> 00:39:03,244
Your anger and rages

502
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:05,587
your freedom...

503
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,957
is in your hands now

504
00:39:07,994 --> 00:39:09,928
Fight for yourselves

505
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:12,294
and the innocents

506
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,598
Freedom is more valued only if

507
00:39:18,237 --> 00:39:21,502
you defeat your enemies, understand?

508
00:39:24,444 --> 00:39:25,672
Set

509
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:30,480
Shoot

510
00:39:32,852 --> 00:39:34,752
Alignment

511
00:39:35,988 --> 00:39:37,080
Shoot

512
00:39:46,232 --> 00:39:48,826
Hurry up, pass around the arrows

513
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:07,946
Look

514
00:40:07,987 --> 00:40:09,818
The excrement really works

515
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:11,483
it puts out the fire

516
00:40:11,524 --> 00:40:13,890
Spread more on the other roof tops

517
00:40:38,117 --> 00:40:39,345
Front attack

518
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,325
Invade South Gate

519
00:40:51,364 --> 00:40:53,730
Invade South Gate

520
00:41:50,823 --> 00:41:53,155
Everybody get up and fight

521
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:03,234
Pour the sulphur

522
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:38,192
Shoot

523
00:42:53,686 --> 00:42:55,176
Give me the stone

524
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:00,821
Pass it along to the wall

525
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,690
Yes

526
00:43:01,827 --> 00:43:03,988
Hurry up

527
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:10,666
Move

528
00:43:18,978 --> 00:43:20,070
Come with me

529
00:43:45,171 --> 00:43:46,832
I'm not, not me

530
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:51,573
My Prince, there are Zhao spies in the town

531
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,778
Dong

532
00:44:56,909 --> 00:44:58,467
Go

533
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,017
You shouldn't be here...

534
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:15,591
You shouldn't...

535
00:45:16,395 --> 00:45:19,523
Get back inside the Gate

536
00:45:59,538 --> 00:46:00,664
Shoot

537
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,367
Bulwark had been taken, two units are moving in

538
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:39,206
South gate was opened, we are moving in

539
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:45,242
You stay behind

540
00:46:45,284 --> 00:46:46,444
Yes

541
00:46:59,031 --> 00:47:00,931
Raise the drawbridge

542
00:47:00,966 --> 00:47:02,297
Hurry up

543
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:10,302
Pull it

544
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:54,218
The drawbridge got stuck

545
00:47:54,253 --> 00:47:55,743
we can't get out and rescue Ge Li

546
00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:04,222
Attack

547
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,023
Three units are approaching

548
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,068
Focus the attack in the Bulwark

549
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:11,933
Cover Ge Li. Go

550
00:49:09,662 --> 00:49:12,358
Shoot! Just shoot

551
00:49:12,398 --> 00:49:13,456
Draw back

552
00:49:22,741 --> 00:49:24,106
Ge Li

553
00:49:24,777 --> 00:49:26,642
- Shoot him
- Pull

554
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:43,686
Close the gate

555
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:45,026
Remove the bodies, quick

556
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:46,190
Close the gate

557
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:47,198
Hurry up

558
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:48,961
Close the gate

559
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,837
Tear down Liang

560
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,632
Protect Commander

561
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:31,975
Close the gate

562
00:50:32,411 --> 00:50:33,673
Stop crying

563
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:35,569
Close the Gate

564
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:37,013
Quick

565
00:50:37,549 --> 00:50:38,106
Move back

566
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:40,141
What sound is that? Quiet

567
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:40,776
Come with me

568
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:42,116
Quiet

569
00:50:42,154 --> 00:50:43,781
Zhao's retreating drum sound

570
00:50:43,822 --> 00:50:45,449
- Zhao is retreating
- Really?

571
00:50:45,491 --> 00:50:48,153
They're retreating, we've made it

572
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:52,186
The Zhao's retreating

573
00:52:03,702 --> 00:52:04,828
Stay in bed

574
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:06,633
tend to your wounds

575
00:52:07,306 --> 00:52:08,432
I'm fine

576
00:52:10,876 --> 00:52:12,844
Where am I?

577
00:52:14,913 --> 00:52:16,540
Dong's room

578
00:52:17,816 --> 00:52:19,306
I'm sorry

579
00:52:20,752 --> 00:52:22,447
He can finally relieve...

580
00:52:23,055 --> 00:52:24,955
only that he cannot die in peace...

581
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,631
Brand new

582
00:52:37,636 --> 00:52:41,094
It's okay, I'm fine with what I have

583
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,301
It isn't worth much

584
00:52:43,342 --> 00:52:45,003
please keep it

585
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:51,305
Mozi shouldn't accept gifts

586
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,977
or else

587
00:52:53,018 --> 00:52:57,250
people will think we are
helping others for their return

588
00:52:57,289 --> 00:52:58,916
Not accepting gifts

589
00:52:58,957 --> 00:53:01,517
doesn't mean no one suspect you

590
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:15,431
Wait...

591
00:53:17,476 --> 00:53:19,068
You'd better stay in here

592
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:20,601
there're lots of people outside

593
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,442
Mr. Ge Li has recovered

594
00:53:35,861 --> 00:53:40,093
Commander, we can't postpone attacking Yan

595
00:53:40,132 --> 00:53:41,861
My suggestion is...

596
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,733
Let's leave 4,000 soldiers guarding Liang

597
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:48,433
they'll surrender when they
run out of food and water

598
00:53:48,473 --> 00:53:49,701
then...

599
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:52,904
we can then take revenge for General Gao

600
00:53:52,945 --> 00:53:55,413
Commander, what do you think?

601
00:53:57,049 --> 00:54:00,041
This battle is no longer a personal affair

602
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:02,815
Liang seems meaningless to us, but...

603
00:54:02,854 --> 00:54:05,322
we under-estimated our enemies,
and were defeated

604
00:54:06,558 --> 00:54:08,287
You think...

605
00:54:08,327 --> 00:54:11,888
we can defeat Yan with our dispirited troops?

606
00:54:11,930 --> 00:54:14,023
Do we have this courage?

607
00:54:16,368 --> 00:54:20,532
I would like to have
opinions from other Generals

608
00:54:59,745 --> 00:55:02,680
This dagger has poison

609
00:55:02,714 --> 00:55:04,909
someone dropped it into my house

610
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:07,111
They're already here...

611
00:55:07,152 --> 00:55:09,245
even if we don't do it...

612
00:55:09,921 --> 00:55:13,186
they'll do it

613
00:55:23,235 --> 00:55:26,898
You don't want to kill Ge Li, right?

614
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,504
You must have forgotten your wife and son...

615
00:55:31,576 --> 00:55:32,941
No

616
00:55:32,978 --> 00:55:35,606
he came here to protect us

617
00:55:35,647 --> 00:55:37,512
How can we do that?

618
00:55:39,685 --> 00:55:40,947
Protect us?

619
00:55:40,986 --> 00:55:42,715
He is giving up our lives

620
00:55:42,754 --> 00:55:44,722
by putting us in the front line?

621
00:55:44,756 --> 00:55:48,214
We're just lucky to be still alive

622
00:55:49,294 --> 00:55:52,058
Even if we'd killed Ge Li...

623
00:55:52,097 --> 00:55:54,861
can we save our families?

624
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,425
If we kill Ge Li...

625
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,937
who's going to save Liang?

626
00:56:04,843 --> 00:56:06,037
I know where he is...

627
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:19,917
Take it

628
00:56:19,958 --> 00:56:21,084
Go

629
00:56:21,126 --> 00:56:22,252
Go

630
00:56:27,632 --> 00:56:29,099
Everybody listen

631
00:56:29,134 --> 00:56:30,567
no matter what, armor or swords

632
00:56:30,602 --> 00:56:33,469
collect all the useful stuffs

633
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:36,574
What are you doing?

634
00:56:44,216 --> 00:56:46,377
Why do you want to kill me?

635
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:47,043
Drop the knife

636
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:48,814
Stay away

637
00:56:48,854 --> 00:56:51,345
Guards

638
00:56:53,892 --> 00:56:55,291
Drop the weapon

639
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:06,730
Mr. Ge Li, he's dead

640
00:57:17,649 --> 00:57:20,550
I've one important announcement today

641
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:22,450
But before I announce

642
00:57:22,487 --> 00:57:24,512
let's give a...

643
00:57:24,556 --> 00:57:27,184
silent meditation to Pu Le, who died yesterday

644
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:31,453
As usual

645
00:57:32,431 --> 00:57:33,830
close your eyes

646
00:57:33,865 --> 00:57:35,924
until the 10th stroke

647
00:57:48,713 --> 00:57:49,975
Traitor

648
00:57:58,323 --> 00:57:59,813
Little girl...

649
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:01,120
don't be afraid

650
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:05,852
why do you have to come to Liang?

651
00:58:07,499 --> 00:58:10,593
It must be the Zhao
assigned her to kill Mr. Ge Li

652
00:58:10,635 --> 00:58:12,694
Right, why do you want to kill Mr. Ge Li

653
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:14,102
Quiet

654
00:58:16,875 --> 00:58:18,604
Bastard, how dare you are

655
00:58:18,643 --> 00:58:22,773
Don't let her go! Kill her

656
00:58:22,814 --> 00:58:23,906
Stop

657
00:58:24,516 --> 00:58:25,483
Back off

658
00:58:26,084 --> 00:58:27,278
Back off

659
00:59:23,408 --> 00:59:24,841
Mr. Ge Li

660
00:59:26,044 --> 00:59:27,534
Where are you going?

661
00:59:30,715 --> 00:59:32,342
I'd like to make myself clear

662
00:59:33,752 --> 00:59:37,210
Mozi will not accept any gifts

663
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,515
Thanks for your gesture

664
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:24,129
Sir

665
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,926
Why do you follow me?

666
01:00:25,965 --> 01:00:28,195
You nearly got killed! Go back

667
01:00:29,769 --> 01:00:32,067
Aren't you going to spy on Zhao Camp?

668
01:00:32,104 --> 01:00:33,799
I always came here riding with the horses

669
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,568
I'm familiar with this area

670
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:37,473
Follow me

671
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:40,836
You're not going

672
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,239
This way is the shortcut

673
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,220
What are they carrying?

674
01:00:53,259 --> 01:00:54,749
Soil

675
01:00:54,794 --> 01:00:56,921
They're digging a tunnel...

676
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:01,189
To Liang?

677
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:11,939
Why are they dumping it into the stream?

678
01:01:11,977 --> 01:01:15,413
The stream will wash away the soil

679
01:01:17,116 --> 01:01:19,243
then, no one will know

680
01:01:19,285 --> 01:01:23,051
how far they had dug

681
01:01:23,089 --> 01:01:24,716
Let's go

682
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:27,090
Someone is up there

683
01:01:39,338 --> 01:01:41,033
There they are

684
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:42,438
Get them

685
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,224
Can you swim?

686
01:02:03,496 --> 01:02:05,259
Go, don't worry about me

687
01:02:05,297 --> 01:02:06,457
Go, quick

688
01:02:11,637 --> 01:02:12,626
Stop running

689
01:02:12,671 --> 01:02:14,866
Surrender or you'll die here

690
01:02:14,907 --> 01:02:15,839
You'll have to save me

691
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:19,174
Move

692
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:07,959
Breathe

693
01:03:09,762 --> 01:03:11,457
You're...

694
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:13,124
very brave

695
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,995
If I didn't jump...

696
01:03:18,137 --> 01:03:19,695
would you jump?

697
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:21,262
I would

698
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:23,332
But I'll kill you first

699
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,604
Is that what you Mozi would have done sanely?

700
01:03:28,314 --> 01:03:30,805
You think killing you is rational?

701
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,545
How are you going to kill me?

702
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,918
Push you down the waterfall

703
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:44,190
Do you feel better now?

704
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:46,027
Can you walk by yourself?

705
01:03:57,309 --> 01:03:59,106
Quiet

706
01:04:05,317 --> 01:04:07,046
There's nothing in the West City and the barn

707
01:04:07,086 --> 01:04:09,020
where are they going to attack?

708
01:04:09,788 --> 01:04:12,916
They'll dig a few tunnels,
there'll be more than one exit

709
01:04:12,958 --> 01:04:16,223
we can't be sure whether we had blocked them all

710
01:04:17,963 --> 01:04:20,090
I'm not blocking them off

711
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:21,531
I'm letting them in

712
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:22,727
No

713
01:04:22,768 --> 01:04:25,862
they must be collaborating
with the force outside

714
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:28,670
I know

715
01:04:28,707 --> 01:04:31,835
we're going to defeat our enemies in a dragnet

716
01:04:32,478 --> 01:04:33,706
After ten days

717
01:04:33,746 --> 01:04:38,376
we can dig three tunnels in here, here and here

718
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:39,577
Commander, what do you think?

719
01:04:39,618 --> 01:04:41,711
Can you speed up the process?

720
01:04:41,754 --> 01:04:45,212
If our soldiers can enter the City

721
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:47,521
Liang will not be able to defend

722
01:04:49,428 --> 01:04:51,589
Three days later

723
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:53,791
will be the advent of winter

724
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:56,824
Longer night time is an advantage for our attack

725
01:04:56,869 --> 01:04:57,836
Commander

726
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:02,398
Someone was spying on us a few days ago...

727
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,932
The longer we take

728
01:05:04,977 --> 01:05:08,811
our enemies may find out the tunnel exits

729
01:05:08,847 --> 01:05:10,940
Gather all the slaves

730
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:14,817
three days later

731
01:05:14,853 --> 01:05:17,617
we'll attack from here

732
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:21,246
Warriors, get ready

733
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:41,536
Commander...

734
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,084
The exit was blocked, move back

735
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,727
Attack

736
01:07:09,334 --> 01:07:10,995
Pull

737
01:07:34,927 --> 01:07:36,758
Drop your weapons

738
01:07:36,795 --> 01:07:38,524
and your lives will be spared

739
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:59,510
They're here

740
01:08:02,855 --> 01:08:04,914
I'm just a slave

741
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:06,424
I don't want to come

742
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:07,152
Stop him

743
01:08:07,192 --> 01:08:08,557
let me go

744
01:08:09,428 --> 01:08:10,588
Kill him

745
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:12,028
What are you doing? Please let her down

746
01:08:13,232 --> 01:08:15,496
Stay back

747
01:08:15,534 --> 01:08:19,231
Please... please, let her go...

748
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:24,634
Please... please, let her go...

749
01:08:25,444 --> 01:08:27,412
Please... don't...

750
01:08:27,446 --> 01:08:29,243
he'll really kill my sister

751
01:08:29,281 --> 01:08:31,010
The Zhao force me

752
01:08:31,049 --> 01:08:32,209
I don't want to come

753
01:08:32,251 --> 01:08:33,240
Please, please...

754
01:08:33,285 --> 01:08:34,684
Please give her back to me

755
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,747
Please let her down

756
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:39,654
Stay back

757
01:08:39,691 --> 01:08:41,556
No please

758
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:44,619
Let her go...

759
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,858
let the child go

760
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:47,866
She's innocent

761
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,368
I just know how to dig tunnels

762
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:52,336
they force me to come

763
01:08:53,805 --> 01:08:55,329
Get ready

764
01:08:55,941 --> 01:08:57,272
Kill

765
01:08:58,677 --> 01:08:59,905
Shoot

766
01:09:08,554 --> 01:09:10,488
Defeating enemies in a dragnet

767
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,628
Quiet

768
01:09:22,668 --> 01:09:24,135
Xiao Xiao, it's okay

769
01:09:25,571 --> 01:09:26,833
Let go of the child

770
01:09:27,606 --> 01:09:29,631
I promise

771
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,870
no one will hurt you

772
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:36,447
Give her to me

773
01:09:36,481 --> 01:09:38,506
Please...

774
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,279
Give me

775
01:09:48,694 --> 01:09:49,490
Xiao-xiao...

776
01:09:49,528 --> 01:09:51,689
Xiao-xiao...

777
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:56,059
Stop

778
01:09:56,835 --> 01:09:57,494
Let him go

779
01:09:58,103 --> 01:09:59,092
Stop

780
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:01,735
Stop

781
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:03,875
Stop

782
01:10:05,143 --> 01:10:06,269
Stop

783
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:10,207
Move back

784
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:11,974
Move back

785
01:10:12,017 --> 01:10:12,984
Everybody back

786
01:10:13,018 --> 01:10:14,280
Everybody move back

787
01:10:14,319 --> 01:10:15,115
Sir, are you alright?

788
01:10:15,153 --> 01:10:16,211
I'm fine

789
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:17,779
All of you assemble at the Square

790
01:10:17,823 --> 01:10:19,757
Hurry Up! Go

791
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,157
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

792
01:11:00,499 --> 01:11:02,126
Let's go back

793
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:09,864
Don't come back

794
01:11:10,842 --> 01:11:14,710
Go along the stream, you'll not be found

795
01:11:19,885 --> 01:11:22,217
Why don't you kill me?

796
01:11:27,959 --> 01:11:30,689
Why do you ask such a foolish question?

797
01:11:33,865 --> 01:11:35,924
Why...

798
01:11:35,967 --> 01:11:38,060
should people kill each other?

799
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,813
I must take revenge for you

800
01:11:54,453 --> 01:11:57,217
It's all my fault

801
01:11:57,255 --> 01:12:01,157
I shouldn't make you suffer

802
01:12:01,193 --> 01:12:03,787
They're inhuman

803
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,145
Congratulations on your astounding victory

804
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:31,815
The King would like to reward you

805
01:12:33,358 --> 01:12:35,053
Please come with me to the Palace

806
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:39,989
Reward?

807
01:12:42,267 --> 01:12:44,497
General Niu...

808
01:12:44,536 --> 01:12:47,994
can't you see all these dead bodies?

809
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:50,006
They were our enemies

810
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,066
Aren't they humans?

811
01:12:53,178 --> 01:12:57,808
When enemies is trying to kill me

812
01:12:57,849 --> 01:13:01,410
I'll have to defend or even kill him

813
01:13:02,187 --> 01:13:05,088
but killing someone because of hatred...

814
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:07,057
it's absolutely wrong

815
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:09,856
What a pity

816
01:13:10,362 --> 01:13:14,162
Every man has his weak point

817
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,863
Mozi Philosophy is not for ruling a country

818
01:13:19,604 --> 01:13:25,065
This Mozi clan will fall...

819
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:31,912
I'd like to be excused

820
01:13:32,684 --> 01:13:36,484
You seem very appreciative of Ge Li

821
01:13:38,857 --> 01:13:41,155
I acknowledge his defending skills

822
01:13:41,193 --> 01:13:44,754
That's where it should end

823
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:51,031
Mozi philosophy is only
applicable in times of war

824
01:13:51,069 --> 01:13:56,097
They're not suitable in times of peace

825
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:58,939
You must be clear on this

826
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:02,413
Yes, my Lord is right

827
01:14:02,447 --> 01:14:03,937
Understood

828
01:14:12,891 --> 01:14:14,722
Watch him closely

829
01:14:14,759 --> 01:14:15,316
Yes

830
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,590
don't let him getting off the track

831
01:14:17,629 --> 01:14:19,119
Yes

832
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:20,961
General Niu

833
01:14:20,999 --> 01:14:21,761
Yes

834
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,825
you must pay close attention

835
01:14:23,869 --> 01:14:27,862
all those revolting thoughts

836
01:14:27,906 --> 01:14:30,397
shall never spread in Liang

837
01:14:30,442 --> 01:14:31,409
Yes

838
01:14:47,759 --> 01:14:49,386
Are you okay?

839
01:14:53,131 --> 01:14:54,598
I'm fine

840
01:14:57,769 --> 01:14:59,498
The weather is getting cold...

841
01:14:59,538 --> 01:15:01,028
I know you don't have any warm clothing...

842
01:15:01,072 --> 01:15:04,633
so I took out my father's coat
and see if it fits or not

843
01:15:04,676 --> 01:15:07,201
I can adjust it...

844
01:15:08,146 --> 01:15:10,808
Just fit, thanks

845
01:15:12,817 --> 01:15:15,342
I'll return it when I leave

846
01:15:16,755 --> 01:15:18,746
When?

847
01:15:19,524 --> 01:15:21,958
I'll leave when this battle is over

848
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:25,962
The battle should be over soon...

849
01:15:26,565 --> 01:15:27,827
very soon

850
01:15:38,577 --> 01:15:41,273
Did you go to the Square last night?

851
01:15:42,380 --> 01:15:43,938
No

852
01:15:43,982 --> 01:15:47,440
You assigned me to keep guard in the North

853
01:15:47,485 --> 01:15:49,749
I'd heard the Zhao army was defeated

854
01:15:49,788 --> 01:15:51,847
Many of them died...

855
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:57,157
lots of them

856
01:15:59,631 --> 01:16:01,792
They're still...

857
01:16:02,534 --> 01:16:05,526
moving their bodies out for burial

858
01:16:07,205 --> 01:16:11,141
Defeating enemies
in a dragnet... is that right?

859
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,127
I remembered

860
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:36,622
my father told me this
when I was a little girl...

861
01:16:37,736 --> 01:16:43,538
When you start questioning
what is right or wrong

862
01:16:43,575 --> 01:16:46,601
you are uncertain with your faith and beliefs

863
01:16:59,924 --> 01:17:02,859
Is it only war can make you stay?

864
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,065
I thought...

865
01:17:10,101 --> 01:17:12,626
you are always looking for peace

866
01:17:26,251 --> 01:17:27,775
Sorry...

867
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:32,346
What for?

868
01:17:46,738 --> 01:17:48,968
You're always like that...

869
01:17:51,076 --> 01:17:54,512
You're so protective with everything you do

870
01:17:55,613 --> 01:17:58,480
You always ask whether you're right or not

871
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:03,747
Is it really that important?

872
01:18:04,656 --> 01:18:06,556
Even if you know it's right

873
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:09,685
but for some people...

874
01:18:09,728 --> 01:18:12,026
they prefers to be wrong

875
01:18:14,866 --> 01:18:17,027
I would want to tell you

876
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:20,500
no matter it's right or wrong

877
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:24,397
I just want to be with you

878
01:18:31,049 --> 01:18:34,883
You talk about universal love all the time

879
01:18:37,856 --> 01:18:39,790
You should know how to love

880
01:18:40,725 --> 01:18:42,249
you know

881
01:18:51,636 --> 01:18:52,933
Ge Li arrives...

882
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:54,563
Liang will survive

883
01:18:54,606 --> 01:18:56,335
Ge Li stays...

884
01:18:56,374 --> 01:18:58,274
Liang will be safe

885
01:18:58,309 --> 01:18:59,606
Ge Li goes...

886
01:18:59,644 --> 01:19:01,737
Liang cannot hold

887
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:03,714
How about if Ge Li leaves?

888
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:14,691
Just those small pieces?

889
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:18,055
Anyway, melt it quickly

890
01:19:26,471 --> 01:19:28,530
Commander

891
01:19:37,282 --> 01:19:39,113
It is time to retreat

892
01:19:44,455 --> 01:19:47,618
News from our spy who returned from Zhao Nation

893
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,126
Proceed

894
01:19:49,661 --> 01:19:51,356
News from Zhao Nation

895
01:19:51,396 --> 01:19:53,057
The King of Qi has ordered an army of 200,000

896
01:19:53,097 --> 01:19:55,065
setting off five days ago to attack Zhao Nation

897
01:19:55,099 --> 01:19:57,329
Zhao Nation is preparing for the war

898
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:00,266
Thanks for your majesty's blessing

899
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:01,670
If that is the case

900
01:20:01,706 --> 01:20:04,539
Xiang Yanzhong will be called back

901
01:20:04,576 --> 01:20:06,635
Liang will be saved

902
01:20:06,678 --> 01:20:08,942
Liang will be saved

903
01:20:10,114 --> 01:20:15,017
However, the news of
Zhao's retreat must not spread

904
01:20:15,053 --> 01:20:16,418
I plead My Lord

905
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:20,857
to withdraw all power from Ge Li immediately

906
01:20:20,892 --> 01:20:22,382
otherwise, people will think it is Ge Li

907
01:20:22,427 --> 01:20:25,760
who defeated the Zhao troops

908
01:20:25,797 --> 01:20:28,391
We have to demolish any chance

909
01:20:28,433 --> 01:20:34,065
for Ge Li's supporters to rebel

910
01:20:34,906 --> 01:20:39,275
You think Ge Li will rebel, General?

911
01:20:40,445 --> 01:20:42,276
I don't think so

912
01:20:42,313 --> 01:20:44,076
Why are you so sure?

913
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:44,774
Because...

914
01:20:44,816 --> 01:20:47,046
Because there is no such need

915
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:51,752
Ge Li's popularity

916
01:20:51,789 --> 01:20:53,757
is now higher than the King

917
01:20:54,626 --> 01:20:56,890
he doesn't need to do a thing

918
01:20:57,829 --> 01:20:59,091
Right?

919
01:21:04,102 --> 01:21:09,540
Someone defending Liang under false pretenses

920
01:21:10,275 --> 01:21:16,703
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

921
01:21:16,748 --> 01:21:19,376
Doesn't it sound the same as rebel?

922
01:21:19,417 --> 01:21:21,817
General, what do you think?

923
01:21:23,621 --> 01:21:28,115
I agree with Royal Tutor but lack of evidence

924
01:21:28,927 --> 01:21:29,859
General Niu

925
01:21:29,894 --> 01:21:30,690
Yes

926
01:21:30,728 --> 01:21:32,195
if you restores your military power

927
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:37,358
would you be able to put down the riot?

928
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:41,597
And arrest all the rebels?

929
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:35,016
They're back

930
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,559
How's it?

931
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:50,534
Commander

932
01:22:53,544 --> 01:22:56,843
Liang must think that we had retreated

933
01:22:56,881 --> 01:23:01,113
We're just left with 1,000 soldiers

934
01:23:01,719 --> 01:23:03,414
Commander

935
01:23:04,088 --> 01:23:07,114
shall we call back part of
our army for the attack?

936
01:23:08,092 --> 01:23:10,219
Victory will come

937
01:23:10,995 --> 01:23:13,327
when there's no way to retreat

938
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:16,899
This battle has to be fast and clear

939
01:23:16,934 --> 01:23:19,494
We'll end this up with Ge Li

940
01:23:55,273 --> 01:23:56,934
New boots?

941
01:24:09,353 --> 01:24:10,877
No problem, Mr. Ge Li

942
01:24:10,922 --> 01:24:13,152
it will be ready when you come back

943
01:24:14,992 --> 01:24:18,519
I disagreed on the massacre last night, but...

944
01:24:18,563 --> 01:24:20,724
You can't stop them...

945
01:24:22,834 --> 01:24:25,132
I always think that killing enemies
is a kind of glory...

946
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:29,899
where will you go after the battle ends?

947
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:35,602
Wherever needs me, I'll be there

948
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:44,681
What if Zhao is being
invaded and ask for your help

949
01:24:44,722 --> 01:24:46,383
will you go?

950
01:24:46,424 --> 01:24:48,051
Of course I would

951
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:51,686
You've wiped out their army

952
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:54,830
then turn around and save their lives?

953
01:24:54,866 --> 01:24:56,993
Those you'd defeated before...

954
01:24:57,034 --> 01:24:59,434
will they accept your help?

955
01:25:03,274 --> 01:25:05,208
Frankly speaking

956
01:25:06,477 --> 01:25:08,104
I'm never sure

957
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:11,340
whether those people I had helped

958
01:25:12,583 --> 01:25:15,746
really appreciate what I've done for them...

959
01:25:17,288 --> 01:25:21,850
Then, Mozi's universal love
is just blind talking?

960
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:27,290
Nothing is perfect

961
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:29,964
I just want no regrets in my life

962
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:32,802
Blacksmith

963
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:36,500
is the pot ready?

964
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:37,565
Sure

965
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:40,008
Mr. Ge Li is a true hero

966
01:25:40,044 --> 01:25:41,739
He's humble and skilled

967
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:45,476
Just the opposite to our royals

968
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:49,117
If our King got a bit of his talent

969
01:25:49,153 --> 01:25:51,678
Liang will be undefeatable

970
01:25:54,892 --> 01:25:56,086
Mr. Ge Li

971
01:25:56,794 --> 01:25:58,022
Mr. Ge Li

972
01:25:58,062 --> 01:25:59,290
we are all set

973
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,456
Let's go

974
01:26:00,498 --> 01:26:02,591
Is this really going to work?

975
01:26:02,633 --> 01:26:04,533
That's psychological tactic

976
01:26:04,569 --> 01:26:07,970
Can you really cook Zhao food?

977
01:26:08,005 --> 01:26:11,372
I can guarantee that
the Zhaos will be miss home-

978
01:26:11,409 --> 01:26:12,706
Here are the firewoods

979
01:26:12,743 --> 01:26:13,710
Put it here

980
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:15,606
Thank you

981
01:26:15,646 --> 01:26:17,307
Pass me the seasoning

982
01:26:17,348 --> 01:26:18,542
Mr. Ge Li...

983
01:26:21,419 --> 01:26:22,351
How is it?

984
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:24,513
There's no one is the Zhao camp

985
01:26:24,555 --> 01:26:25,180
They retreated?

986
01:26:25,223 --> 01:26:27,453
Yes. It's abandoned. Nothing's there

987
01:26:27,491 --> 01:26:30,153
You guys first go back.
I'll go and check it out

988
01:26:33,598 --> 01:26:34,997
Come on

989
01:26:35,032 --> 01:26:36,397
Let's have some meat

990
01:26:38,636 --> 01:26:40,763
Is that Zhao's food? What a great smell

991
01:26:43,608 --> 01:26:44,939
Open the Gate

992
01:26:44,976 --> 01:26:46,603
Ge Li is back

993
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:05,892
By order of the Royal Court

994
01:27:05,930 --> 01:27:09,696
Ge Li is defending Liang under false pretenses

995
01:27:09,734 --> 01:27:13,670
and initiates rebellion by
imposing personal adoration

996
01:27:13,704 --> 01:27:16,138
Be arrested, otherwise

997
01:27:16,173 --> 01:27:17,435
you will be killed

998
01:27:23,347 --> 01:27:24,712
General...

999
01:27:37,561 --> 01:27:38,858
Ge Li!

1000
01:27:45,269 --> 01:27:47,464
I'd always suspected your motives

1001
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:54,509
How dare you seize my land

1002
01:27:55,212 --> 01:27:57,271
I'm going to kill you today

1003
01:28:03,187 --> 01:28:04,347
Take me hostage

1004
01:28:06,557 --> 01:28:08,024
My Prince...

1005
01:28:08,059 --> 01:28:09,356
Thank you

1006
01:28:09,393 --> 01:28:11,293
Draw back

1007
01:28:13,964 --> 01:28:15,056
Move back

1008
01:28:16,567 --> 01:28:17,625
Open the Gate

1009
01:28:17,668 --> 01:28:19,033
Open the Gate

1010
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:30,710
Ge Li, let go my Prince

1011
01:28:30,748 --> 01:28:32,306
the King will pardon you

1012
01:28:38,456 --> 01:28:40,686
Prepare Ge Li's arrows

1013
01:28:40,725 --> 01:28:41,851
Yes sir

1014
01:28:52,937 --> 01:28:54,029
Thank you

1015
01:28:54,071 --> 01:28:56,904
Mr. Ge Li

1016
01:28:57,775 --> 01:28:59,470
Sir...

1017
01:29:01,145 --> 01:29:02,942
may I follow by your side?

1018
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:06,882
You should go back

1019
01:29:06,917 --> 01:29:09,715
Staying in Liang is much more important

1020
01:29:09,754 --> 01:29:11,244
Don't you wish to see more people

1021
01:29:11,288 --> 01:29:14,280
passing on Mozi's thought of peace?

1022
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:19,427
Remember

1023
01:29:19,463 --> 01:29:21,021
those who know how to defend a city

1024
01:29:21,065 --> 01:29:22,896
cannot bring peace to the world

1025
01:29:22,933 --> 01:29:28,530
Peace lies on the kings of all nations

1026
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:29,698
Understand?

1027
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:33,176
Ge Li, release the Prince

1028
01:29:34,612 --> 01:29:36,512
Ge Li had released me

1029
01:29:36,547 --> 01:29:37,809
I'm coming back

1030
01:29:37,848 --> 01:29:39,145
Stop

1031
01:29:39,183 --> 01:29:40,309
Sir

1032
01:29:47,925 --> 01:29:49,017
Thank you

1033
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,690
Let's go

1034
01:29:50,728 --> 01:29:52,593
We're not going back

1035
01:29:52,630 --> 01:29:54,029
Where're you guys going?

1036
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:54,894
Let's go home

1037
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,194
We've got no home

1038
01:29:57,134 --> 01:29:59,932
The Prince is coming back

1039
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:01,130
Get ready

1040
01:30:01,172 --> 01:30:02,639
Yes

1041
01:30:02,673 --> 01:30:04,163
Aren't they...

1042
01:30:04,208 --> 01:30:07,234
retreated already? Why...

1043
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:11,047
What sound is that?

1044
01:30:11,081 --> 01:30:13,948
Shoot as far as you can

1045
01:30:13,984 --> 01:30:15,246
Run

1046
01:30:15,286 --> 01:30:16,344
Quick

1047
01:30:19,323 --> 01:30:20,585
Fire

1048
01:30:27,164 --> 01:30:28,631
Run

1049
01:30:33,003 --> 01:30:35,403
Mr. Ge Li

1050
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:37,964
Don't come back, go

1051
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:40,433
Go

1052
01:30:57,695 --> 01:30:59,356
Search for the bodies

1053
01:30:59,396 --> 01:31:00,829
Come with me

1054
01:31:10,574 --> 01:31:15,068
My Lordship Liang Shi has fallen

1055
01:31:15,779 --> 01:31:17,872
Your servant has killed the Prince by accident

1056
01:31:17,915 --> 01:31:20,008
I'll never be forgiven

1057
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:25,853
However, Liang is still under the threat of riot

1058
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:28,051
I plead with you my Lord

1059
01:31:28,092 --> 01:31:31,220
to let me accomplish
my mission in a hundred days

1060
01:31:31,262 --> 01:31:33,457
I swear I can eliminate all Ge Li's league

1061
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,690
I will take my punishment after that

1062
01:31:42,339 --> 01:31:44,307
Please, My Lord

1063
01:31:46,076 --> 01:31:49,375
Liang Shi...

1064
01:31:49,413 --> 01:31:52,109
is my only son

1065
01:31:54,451 --> 01:31:57,477
he was the future of Liang

1066
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:02,752
You ruined the future of Liang

1067
01:32:02,793 --> 01:32:04,954
Pardoning you?

1068
01:32:08,098 --> 01:32:11,124
That's ridiculous

1069
01:32:19,043 --> 01:32:21,204
But taking into account of your loyalty

1070
01:32:22,513 --> 01:32:26,745
and all you've done in defending Liang

1071
01:32:30,321 --> 01:32:32,312
moreover...

1072
01:32:34,024 --> 01:32:36,754
protection of Liang

1073
01:32:37,728 --> 01:32:40,959
cannot lie on outsiders

1074
01:32:46,337 --> 01:32:49,738
I'm in a hard position

1075
01:32:52,576 --> 01:32:56,535
I'll accept your plea. Hundred days later

1076
01:32:58,415 --> 01:32:59,939
your accusation will be denounced

1077
01:33:02,286 --> 01:33:04,015
Thank you, My Lord

1078
01:33:21,071 --> 01:33:24,507
Why are you taking me?
What have I done?

1079
01:33:40,858 --> 01:33:43,326
General, what's happening here?

1080
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,260
The King's decree

1081
01:33:45,295 --> 01:33:46,523
capture all the rebels

1082
01:33:53,137 --> 01:33:54,627
Rinse again with water

1083
01:33:57,875 --> 01:34:00,742
What have you asked me for, Sir?

1084
01:34:04,048 --> 01:34:05,777
The King ordered you to kill Ge Li

1085
01:34:05,816 --> 01:34:07,909
Why didn't you shoot him last night?

1086
01:34:11,188 --> 01:34:12,746
Ge Li has done nothing wrong

1087
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:16,015
He saved all the Liang people

1088
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,527
You disobeyed the King's command

1089
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:22,291
You will be punished

1090
01:34:22,332 --> 01:34:23,264
What do you guys want?

1091
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,927
Let go of me

1092
01:34:24,968 --> 01:34:25,935
Stop

1093
01:34:27,604 --> 01:34:29,071
Stop

1094
01:35:00,504 --> 01:35:02,836
Sometimes, I really don't know...

1095
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:06,009
what is cause and effect

1096
01:35:12,249 --> 01:35:13,614
There's no cause and effect

1097
01:35:17,287 --> 01:35:21,189
You saved them, and they turn against you

1098
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,892
Mozi...

1099
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:28,659
doesn't ask for returns

1100
01:35:32,169 --> 01:35:35,730
Are all Mozis like that?

1101
01:35:35,773 --> 01:35:39,072
How come you came here alone?

1102
01:35:41,178 --> 01:35:43,544
Mozi...

1103
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,480
didn't send anyone to Liang

1104
01:35:49,219 --> 01:35:50,618
You came here on your own will?

1105
01:35:51,989 --> 01:35:54,787
How many cities can you protect?

1106
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:58,690
There are never ending wars and battles

1107
01:35:58,729 --> 01:36:02,597
peace will only come

1108
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:05,261
when the seven nations are united

1109
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:07,998
I believe universal love

1110
01:36:08,038 --> 01:36:10,404
is the only path towards peace

1111
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:19,313
Mozi's "universal love" is loving everyone

1112
01:36:19,349 --> 01:36:24,514
that means you don't know whom you should love

1113
01:36:35,165 --> 01:36:37,099
Where are you going?

1114
01:36:37,134 --> 01:36:38,328
To Liang

1115
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:41,269
and let someone I love know that I am safe

1116
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:49,670
It's all underground stream here

1117
01:36:49,713 --> 01:36:50,907
and you're injured

1118
01:36:50,948 --> 01:36:53,849
It's too dangerous, I'll go for you

1119
01:37:07,497 --> 01:37:09,328
Your Majesty

1120
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:12,062
these people were in league with Ge Li

1121
01:37:12,102 --> 01:37:13,330
They are traitors

1122
01:37:13,370 --> 01:37:15,531
My Lord...

1123
01:37:15,572 --> 01:37:20,737
I have nothing to do with Ge Li

1124
01:37:20,777 --> 01:37:25,305
I know nothing about his rebellion...

1125
01:37:27,184 --> 01:37:28,515
Immoral, selfish

1126
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:32,179
When everyone praise Ge Li

1127
01:37:32,222 --> 01:37:34,986
respect him and listen to him

1128
01:37:35,025 --> 01:37:35,957
Will you say such things?

1129
01:37:35,993 --> 01:37:40,794
I'm just a farmer, I just want to live my life

1130
01:37:40,831 --> 01:37:44,631
I don't care who's a hero

1131
01:37:44,668 --> 01:37:47,262
I just miss my family, my child

1132
01:37:47,304 --> 01:37:51,365
my home... My Lord...

1133
01:37:52,509 --> 01:37:54,636
Your city is in great danger

1134
01:37:55,379 --> 01:37:59,008
and you are just self-seeking

1135
01:37:59,616 --> 01:38:02,744
Don't you know how many unfortunate lives

1136
01:38:02,786 --> 01:38:05,550
we had lost to save our city?

1137
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:07,523
Without Ge Li

1138
01:38:07,557 --> 01:38:09,582
we never would have been saved

1139
01:38:09,626 --> 01:38:11,116
Guard

1140
01:38:12,562 --> 01:38:13,824
Sir

1141
01:38:13,864 --> 01:38:14,558
Slap her

1142
01:38:14,598 --> 01:38:15,530
Yes

1143
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,377
You are the descendants of my loyal servant

1144
01:38:28,412 --> 01:38:33,247
and you grew up with my beloved son

1145
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:37,617
I'll have mercy on you, I'm granting you death

1146
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:40,555
you'll have a Royal funeral

1147
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:44,287
you'll be honored as Calvary Princess

1148
01:38:44,328 --> 01:38:48,822
and buried with my beloved son...

1149
01:38:48,865 --> 01:38:50,423
It's all rubbish

1150
01:38:51,969 --> 01:38:54,096
You just want me

1151
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,595
to be a burial item in your son's tomb

1152
01:38:57,641 --> 01:39:00,007
You want all of us

1153
01:39:00,043 --> 01:39:02,944
to die under you verdict

1154
01:39:05,048 --> 01:39:07,016
so as to prove and

1155
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:09,109
show your power

1156
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:10,813
But if it wasn't Ge Li

1157
01:39:10,854 --> 01:39:13,948
and those who died in the war

1158
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:15,720
Would you still be able

1159
01:39:15,759 --> 01:39:17,192
to abuse your people?

1160
01:39:17,227 --> 01:39:18,694
Shut up

1161
01:39:20,864 --> 01:39:23,424
This girl no longer
belongs to the royal families

1162
01:39:23,467 --> 01:39:26,459
She was in league with Ge Li

1163
01:39:26,503 --> 01:39:29,131
She will be executed in the public...

1164
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,572
ripped to shreds by five horses

1165
01:39:39,716 --> 01:39:40,683
Execute

1166
01:39:42,019 --> 01:39:43,543
Execute them all

1167
01:39:43,587 --> 01:39:44,986
Yes

1168
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:46,046
Execution

1169
01:39:46,089 --> 01:39:49,058
My Lord! My Lord

1170
01:39:57,167 --> 01:40:00,432
Report to the King, Yi Yue was muted

1171
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,437
Yes

1172
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,711
Warriors

1173
01:41:18,748 --> 01:41:22,047
behind this slope, there is a city

1174
01:41:22,085 --> 01:41:24,952
in that city, there're 4,000 people

1175
01:41:25,489 --> 01:41:28,049
but under the ground outside this city

1176
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:30,389
there're 5,000 warriors

1177
01:41:30,427 --> 01:41:35,831
friends and brothers who came with us

1178
01:41:35,866 --> 01:41:38,061
we can't just leave them there

1179
01:41:38,768 --> 01:41:42,397
they were killed even after

1180
01:41:42,439 --> 01:41:45,135
throwing down their weapons

1181
01:41:45,175 --> 01:41:47,666
their bodies were even

1182
01:41:47,711 --> 01:41:50,441
tossed from the Wall...

1183
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:55,315
we'll fight for our
fallen brothers to our last soldier

1184
01:42:13,937 --> 01:42:15,370
Start

1185
01:42:28,351 --> 01:42:29,841
What's that?

1186
01:42:31,488 --> 01:42:34,457
Anything you want to say?

1187
01:42:52,509 --> 01:42:54,033
What did you see?

1188
01:42:54,077 --> 01:42:55,408
There's nothing

1189
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:01,474
Look! Over there

1190
01:43:03,887 --> 01:43:06,856
Zhao is attacking again

1191
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:08,551
Shoot them

1192
01:43:13,730 --> 01:43:16,255
The Zhao's here...

1193
01:43:20,604 --> 01:43:21,434
Protect the King

1194
01:43:21,471 --> 01:43:22,631
Hurry up, protect the King

1195
01:43:22,672 --> 01:43:24,299
My Lord, this way

1196
01:43:25,342 --> 01:43:27,606
Get more soldiers up here

1197
01:43:30,513 --> 01:43:32,913
Wait! How about us?

1198
01:43:33,450 --> 01:43:35,714
All soldiers report to you captain

1199
01:43:37,821 --> 01:43:38,913
Bring her back to the prison

1200
01:43:40,690 --> 01:43:41,952
Come with me

1201
01:43:54,871 --> 01:43:55,929
No! Stop

1202
01:43:55,972 --> 01:43:57,030
Stop

1203
01:43:57,073 --> 01:43:58,870
Stop shooting

1204
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:01,671
Go, quick

1205
01:44:01,711 --> 01:44:02,837
Go

1206
01:44:06,483 --> 01:44:07,814
General...

1207
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:10,285
General, let's go

1208
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:11,878
Go?

1209
01:44:11,921 --> 01:44:14,583
This is betrayal

1210
01:44:16,159 --> 01:44:18,252
If you won't leave, neither will we

1211
01:44:21,865 --> 01:44:23,264
General

1212
01:44:24,034 --> 01:44:25,695
whatever we do...

1213
01:44:25,735 --> 01:44:27,669
we're all rebels

1214
01:44:27,704 --> 01:44:30,434
All your men have been...

1215
01:44:30,473 --> 01:44:32,202
dispersed already

1216
01:44:33,777 --> 01:44:35,836
or you would like...

1217
01:44:35,879 --> 01:44:39,076
to see us all get our wrists broken?

1218
01:44:46,122 --> 01:44:48,454
Fight for our homeland

1219
01:44:54,597 --> 01:44:55,859
Bring more arrows here

1220
01:45:22,792 --> 01:45:24,350
Kill all those who tried to run

1221
01:45:24,928 --> 01:45:26,555
and all those evade

1222
01:45:26,596 --> 01:45:28,359
What's going on, sister?

1223
01:45:28,398 --> 01:45:29,262
Come, quick

1224
01:45:44,914 --> 01:45:46,575
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1225
01:45:46,616 --> 01:45:49,016
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1226
01:45:49,052 --> 01:45:50,713
Alright

1227
01:45:50,754 --> 01:45:52,722
I'll be right behind the wall

1228
01:46:08,037 --> 01:46:09,868
Run?

1229
01:46:13,076 --> 01:46:14,976
Get the horses out, quick

1230
01:46:16,146 --> 01:46:17,113
Hurry up

1231
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,912
Kill all those who run

1232
01:46:27,190 --> 01:46:28,157
Go

1233
01:46:28,892 --> 01:46:29,551
General

1234
01:46:29,592 --> 01:46:31,719
The archers had taken down the North Gate

1235
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:34,787
around 800 of them had escaped

1236
01:46:36,933 --> 01:46:38,924
Abandon the North Gate

1237
01:46:39,936 --> 01:46:41,836
get all soldiers to the Bulwark

1238
01:46:41,871 --> 01:46:43,065
await for my command

1239
01:46:43,106 --> 01:46:44,073
Yes

1240
01:47:01,558 --> 01:47:03,185
General

1241
01:47:03,226 --> 01:47:04,955
it's over

1242
01:47:04,994 --> 01:47:06,552
we should...

1243
01:47:06,596 --> 01:47:07,756
surrender

1244
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:09,025
We can't surrender...

1245
01:47:09,065 --> 01:47:10,896
General, Ge Li said

1246
01:47:10,934 --> 01:47:13,425
if we surrender, we will end up even worst

1247
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:15,665
General, Ge Li said that...

1248
01:47:17,207 --> 01:47:20,506
Stop talking about Ge Li, there're only us now

1249
01:47:20,543 --> 01:47:22,135
General...

1250
01:47:25,215 --> 01:47:26,477
Any arrows left?

1251
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:28,679
Listen

1252
01:47:29,652 --> 01:47:31,984
We can't rely on others

1253
01:47:32,021 --> 01:47:33,545
We have to hang on even if we have

1254
01:47:33,590 --> 01:47:35,114
only one soldier left

1255
01:47:39,095 --> 01:47:41,393
General...

1256
01:47:41,431 --> 01:47:43,695
the enemies are here. Leave now

1257
01:47:43,733 --> 01:47:45,291
Everybody, run now

1258
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:51,731
Let's go

1259
01:48:06,322 --> 01:48:07,755
General...

1260
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:09,189
run...

1261
01:48:13,429 --> 01:48:15,488
This person is the great General Niu

1262
01:49:19,996 --> 01:49:20,963
Commander

1263
01:49:20,997 --> 01:49:24,455
defending the city is Ge Li's intention

1264
01:49:25,134 --> 01:49:26,761
Commander

1265
01:49:26,803 --> 01:49:31,570
we're suppose to hand him over to you...

1266
01:49:31,608 --> 01:49:34,475
but he had escaped

1267
01:49:49,225 --> 01:49:51,250
Ge Li...

1268
01:49:51,661 --> 01:49:53,993
Ge Li...

1269
01:49:54,797 --> 01:49:56,662
by tomorrow's noon time

1270
01:49:56,699 --> 01:49:59,190
if you don't come back...

1271
01:49:59,235 --> 01:50:01,260
we'll burn down the City

1272
01:50:01,304 --> 01:50:04,432
and its entire people

1273
01:50:09,545 --> 01:50:11,479
Please lead us to fight back

1274
01:50:11,514 --> 01:50:13,573
I am willing to give up my life

1275
01:50:13,616 --> 01:50:15,777
So do we

1276
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:17,809
If we go back, more people will die

1277
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:26,954
Why can't we end this war...

1278
01:50:26,996 --> 01:50:30,090
in a rational way?

1279
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:32,591
You really want to go back?

1280
01:50:33,436 --> 01:50:34,630
...is it worth it?

1281
01:50:37,707 --> 01:50:39,299
If this can really stop the war

1282
01:50:41,577 --> 01:50:43,568
and save more lives

1283
01:50:44,213 --> 01:50:45,544
why not?

1284
01:50:46,716 --> 01:50:47,774
...is it worth it?

1285
01:50:51,788 --> 01:50:54,450
Bring all the men out, leave the women here

1286
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:56,014
Go, quick

1287
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:58,923
Keep moving, hurry up

1288
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:10,835
Commander, I think Ge Li will not come

1289
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,610
We'd taken Liang already, why don't we go back?

1290
01:51:21,651 --> 01:51:23,676
We can reach our main force

1291
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,587
and return Handan

1292
01:51:26,622 --> 01:51:28,590
and protect our homeland

1293
01:51:29,592 --> 01:51:31,583
Isn't that just another battle field?

1294
01:51:31,627 --> 01:51:34,755
There's only victory & defeat

1295
01:51:36,165 --> 01:51:38,531
we have taken Liang

1296
01:51:38,568 --> 01:51:40,832
but it's not a victory

1297
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:43,202
Ge Li had lost

1298
01:51:43,239 --> 01:51:47,938
His theory is impractical,
idealism leads to jealousy

1299
01:51:48,978 --> 01:51:51,105
He can't even gain the trust

1300
01:51:51,147 --> 01:51:53,411
of those he helped

1301
01:51:53,449 --> 01:51:55,713
He was totally beaten

1302
01:51:56,953 --> 01:52:00,081
There is no winner in this battle

1303
01:52:00,123 --> 01:52:03,854
I know Ge Li had lost

1304
01:52:03,893 --> 01:52:05,656
but...

1305
01:52:05,695 --> 01:52:08,425
I had to defeat him myself

1306
01:52:34,323 --> 01:52:36,348
Someone is coming

1307
01:52:36,392 --> 01:52:38,826
Mr Ge Li?

1308
01:52:48,404 --> 01:52:49,336
Close the Gate

1309
01:53:01,384 --> 01:53:02,976
Commander

1310
01:53:03,019 --> 01:53:04,111
on the battlefield

1311
01:53:05,054 --> 01:53:06,248
we had a fair fight

1312
01:53:07,023 --> 01:53:08,388
and no regrets

1313
01:53:09,158 --> 01:53:10,716
You've taken Liang already

1314
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:14,262
why do you have to kill all its people?

1315
01:53:16,132 --> 01:53:17,156
Nonsense

1316
01:53:19,635 --> 01:53:22,399
You think war is a game?

1317
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:25,805
They fought for you

1318
01:53:25,842 --> 01:53:27,207
you failed

1319
01:53:27,243 --> 01:53:29,211
and with no responsibility

1320
01:53:29,245 --> 01:53:30,906
you left

1321
01:53:32,281 --> 01:53:34,681
It's you...

1322
01:53:34,717 --> 01:53:37,515
you bring them to the battlefield

1323
01:53:41,557 --> 01:53:42,751
Fine

1324
01:53:42,792 --> 01:53:44,817
It's totally between you and me

1325
01:53:46,863 --> 01:53:50,390
Will Commander end all this with me alone

1326
01:53:50,433 --> 01:53:53,493
on the gate tower?

1327
01:53:54,337 --> 01:53:56,066
No matter who wins

1328
01:53:59,775 --> 01:54:02,107
please spare these people's life

1329
01:54:02,879 --> 01:54:05,575
It is all between me and Ge Li

1330
01:54:05,615 --> 01:54:08,413
Only one of us can walk out from the Gate Tower

1331
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:11,352
No matter who he is

1332
01:54:11,387 --> 01:54:13,412
everything will end

1333
01:54:21,764 --> 01:54:24,130
What are you waiting for?

1334
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,326
Let's start

1335
01:54:25,368 --> 01:54:26,596
Forget it

1336
01:54:28,204 --> 01:54:30,764
As you had said

1337
01:54:30,806 --> 01:54:32,706
no matter who get out of here

1338
01:54:32,742 --> 01:54:34,869
this whole thing will be over

1339
01:54:35,478 --> 01:54:38,606
Go now, Ge Li is willing to stay here

1340
01:54:39,348 --> 01:54:40,713
Good strategy

1341
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,108
I promised to retreat

1342
01:54:44,053 --> 01:54:46,044
just because I want to defeat you

1343
01:54:46,622 --> 01:54:49,090
but now, you give up

1344
01:54:49,125 --> 01:54:52,253
I am leading 100,000 soldiers

1345
01:54:52,295 --> 01:54:55,753
but before attacking Yan,
I'd already lost 5,000 men

1346
01:54:55,798 --> 01:54:58,528
and afterall, I didn't get Liang

1347
01:54:58,567 --> 01:55:00,626
but at least...

1348
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:02,399
now...

1349
01:55:02,438 --> 01:55:04,338
I can kill you

1350
01:55:04,373 --> 01:55:06,238
and take revenge for my men

1351
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,082
Don't use the dead ones as an excuse

1352
01:55:15,318 --> 01:55:17,377
to cover up your savageness

1353
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:20,213
War...

1354
01:55:21,824 --> 01:55:24,918
will only cause more death

1355
01:55:25,995 --> 01:55:29,954
Both the dead and
the living ones have to suffer...

1356
01:55:29,999 --> 01:55:31,261
Enough

1357
01:55:33,836 --> 01:55:36,202
In battlefields

1358
01:55:36,238 --> 01:55:39,002
survivors are the winners

1359
01:55:44,013 --> 01:55:45,776
Survivors are winners?

1360
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:49,816
Though you survive

1361
01:55:51,921 --> 01:55:54,890
can your 5,000 soldiers come back?

1362
01:55:59,328 --> 01:56:00,590
Retreat

1363
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,927
end this war now

1364
01:56:08,537 --> 01:56:10,164
or else...

1365
01:56:11,774 --> 01:56:14,174
the rest of your men

1366
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:16,178
will also lose their lives

1367
01:56:49,945 --> 01:56:51,708
My auxiliary troop has arrived

1368
01:57:32,955 --> 01:57:34,582
General Wei, we're besieged

1369
01:57:34,623 --> 01:57:35,282
Warrirors

1370
01:57:36,325 --> 01:57:38,418
Fight

1371
01:57:45,034 --> 01:57:48,333
Everybody fight and drive the Zhaos out

1372
01:58:01,016 --> 01:58:02,608
That way

1373
01:58:14,163 --> 01:58:15,391
Ask yourself

1374
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,397
Is it for the soldiers

1375
01:58:19,435 --> 01:58:21,596
or for your own savageness?

1376
01:58:23,706 --> 01:58:25,037
Please leave

1377
01:58:26,675 --> 01:58:30,475
don't let any more people lose their lives...

1378
01:58:37,186 --> 01:58:38,517
Go now

1379
01:58:39,522 --> 01:58:41,319
I was defeated

1380
01:58:41,357 --> 01:58:44,884
I'm staying here

1381
01:58:45,694 --> 01:58:47,355
Please go

1382
01:58:48,264 --> 01:58:49,288
Commander...

1383
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,161
Survivors are the winners

1384
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:03,141
Commander

1385
01:59:04,046 --> 01:59:06,105
is victory

1386
01:59:06,148 --> 01:59:08,013
more important than your life?

1387
01:59:12,054 --> 01:59:15,421
My life must be meaningful

1388
01:59:17,793 --> 01:59:19,283
Please go

1389
01:59:19,328 --> 01:59:21,319
and tell my people to leave

1390
01:59:21,363 --> 01:59:23,024
I can't help you

1391
01:59:25,467 --> 01:59:27,128
You bring them here

1392
01:59:27,169 --> 01:59:29,194
you should save them

1393
01:59:30,906 --> 01:59:32,771
There is someone I have to save

1394
01:59:46,388 --> 01:59:47,821
Yi Yue...

1395
01:59:48,958 --> 01:59:50,516
Yi Yue...

1396
01:59:57,866 --> 01:59:59,163
Shoot

1397
02:00:01,237 --> 02:00:02,670
Don't run

1398
02:00:02,705 --> 02:00:04,104
Attack

1399
02:00:15,784 --> 02:00:17,342
Yi Yue...

1400
02:01:23,452 --> 02:01:29,254
Can you hear me? Are you there?

1401
02:01:40,202 --> 02:01:45,105
Yi Yue! Where are you?

1402
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:48,804
Yi Yue...

1403
02:01:51,547 --> 02:01:53,606
Commander, we must leave now

1404
02:01:54,683 --> 02:01:58,346
You all leave now.
General Wei will lead you home

1405
02:01:58,387 --> 02:01:59,445
Commander...

1406
02:01:59,488 --> 02:02:01,422
This is my command

1407
02:02:01,457 --> 02:02:04,358
I want you all to leave

1408
02:02:05,661 --> 02:02:08,425
Back to you homeland

1409
02:02:09,865 --> 02:02:11,093
Yes

1410
02:02:18,640 --> 02:02:19,834
Listen

1411
02:02:20,509 --> 02:02:21,908
Aim at their feet

1412
02:02:21,944 --> 02:02:23,070
Ready

1413
02:02:24,313 --> 02:02:25,473
Shoot

1414
02:02:40,796 --> 02:02:43,765
General Wei, the Commander ordered you

1415
02:02:43,799 --> 02:02:45,596
to lead our retreat

1416
02:02:46,735 --> 02:02:48,259
Retreat

1417
02:02:49,671 --> 02:02:51,070
Leave now

1418
02:02:52,107 --> 02:02:55,440
I'll stay with the Commander

1419
02:02:55,477 --> 02:02:57,172
The commander ordered you

1420
02:02:57,212 --> 02:02:59,271
to lead our retreat

1421
02:02:59,314 --> 02:03:01,043
We came together, we'll leave together

1422
02:03:01,083 --> 02:03:03,142
Right! We came together
and leave together

1423
02:03:03,185 --> 02:03:04,743
Yes, we'll leave together

1424
02:03:05,687 --> 02:03:07,120
I'm not leaving

1425
02:03:07,156 --> 02:03:08,316
Go now

1426
02:03:08,357 --> 02:03:10,587
Take the General

1427
02:03:10,626 --> 02:03:11,684
Let me down

1428
02:03:12,561 --> 02:03:14,028
I'm not leaving

1429
02:03:14,062 --> 02:03:16,895
Let me down, that's my order...

1430
02:03:18,033 --> 02:03:19,432
Let me down

1431
02:03:20,469 --> 02:03:22,699
I order you to let me down...

1432
02:06:01,730 --> 02:06:02,719
Shoot

1433
02:06:02,764 --> 02:06:03,924
Yes

1434
02:06:04,900 --> 02:06:06,060
Archers

1435
02:06:07,069 --> 02:06:07,933
Get ready

1436
02:06:09,104 --> 02:06:10,093
Shoot

1437
02:06:30,726 --> 02:06:31,988
Long live My Lord

1438
02:06:33,895 --> 02:06:35,760
Long live My Lord

1439
02:07:12,768 --> 02:07:14,429
Where's General?

1440
02:07:49,771 --> 02:07:51,398
Xiao Xiao, stay in here

1441
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,704
no matter what, don't come out, okay?

1442
02:07:55,677 --> 02:07:57,611
I'll be right behind the wall

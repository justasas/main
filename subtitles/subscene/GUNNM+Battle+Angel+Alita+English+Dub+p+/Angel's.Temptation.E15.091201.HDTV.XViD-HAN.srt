Temptation Of An Angel

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,059
Episode 15

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,255
Ah Ran.

4
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:19,650
Marry me.

5
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:28,406
Even if you approached me
because of my money,

6
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:31,259
it doesn't matter.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,868
<i>Use me, need me.</i>

8
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:40,496
Everyone says love is
selfish anyways.

9
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,053
I've married before.

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,987
Even if I have problems
with my husband's family.

11
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,248
It doesn't matter?

12
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:57,777
You don't know anything about my past.

13
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:09,272
For you, what I want to
know isn't your past.

14
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:13,043
It's how much you love me now.

15
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:17,158
<i>I don't care if you're whoever's
daughter-in-law, whoever's lover.</i>

16
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:20,745
If it's Joo Ah Ran,

17
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,402
I'm confident in loving
you until the end.

18
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:46,486
Why did you come? I'll listen to
the important things first.

19
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,485
{\a6}Episode 15

20
00:01:46,758 --> 00:01:50,069
Once Ah Ran arrives, I'll speak.

21
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:52,447
Ah Ran's like this, Doctor Nam's like this.

22
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:55,123
If we have nothing to
listen to, please leave.

23
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,382
No, you have to listen.

24
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:00,594
Until now, I've been following you.

25
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,638
From this moment on,

26
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:04,344
however I want it done,
it'll be done that way.

27
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,760
What is this attitude?

28
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:09,352
You want to separate from us starting now?

29
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:11,974
Is there anyone in the world that acts
friendly with people they hate?

30
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:16,631
<i>I'm not like a pig that would blindly seek
approval from a hateful master.</i>

31
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:21,085
There's no reason to endure
Madam's type of treatment.

32
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:26,462
You scary person. Who do you
dare talk to like that?

33
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,540
<i>Even if it's like this,
I treated you like my own son.</i>

34
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:30,668
If I was really your son,

35
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:33,107
you wouldn't remember and mention every little
thing you've done for me over the years.

36
00:02:33,227 --> 00:02:34,225
What?

37
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:37,344
I don't want to be treated
like Hyun Woo Hyung.

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,725
I was never once this family's son.

39
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:43,537
Even when I ate warm rice,
it always caught in my throat.

40
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,411
And because of the cold stares on my back,

41
00:02:46,616 --> 00:02:51,871
I was never once comfortable here.

42
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:55,182
<i>To President, I'm only Secretary Nam's son.</i>

43
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:58,742
<i>To Madam, I'm an annoying person's guest.</i>

44
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,736
Then.

45
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:20,000
Mom... Dad...

46
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,183
Help me.

47
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,627
Even if it's leaving through
the back door with the king,

48
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:32,085
don't let Ahjussi leave me.

49
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:37,648
I lived not asking for anything else.

50
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:46,604
Help me grant my wish.

51
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:56,208
I mentioned you to my parents in America.

52
00:03:56,406 --> 00:04:00,531
At first they only thought their son only
did business and didn't want to marry.

53
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,346
After I said I love a woman,
they're busy getting ready.

54
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:07,198
Have a wedding ceremony in Korea,

55
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:11,266
then go to America to expand my business.

56
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,208
It's so tiring.

57
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:20,834
With Jae Sung by my side,
I feel really fortunate.

58
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:28,777
I'll arrange my things quickly,
I'll have to go.

59
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:40,055
I'm not confident in waiting that long.

60
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,268
Right, it's not much,

61
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,434
I prepared a present.
Open it when you get home.

62
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:15,308
You're still here? You're a lot
more stubborn than I thought.

63
00:05:15,434 --> 00:05:19,950
Woman like you also has a true heart?

64
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:22,140
<i>Are you not afraid of the sky?</i>

65
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,874
Carrying too many crimes,
how will you go to hell?

66
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,673
Got pushed away by Jae Sung, looks like
you're releasing your anger on me.

67
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:35,048
My good mood today,
I don't want you to ruin it.

68
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:42,113
Today, to me and Jae Sung,
is a special day.

69
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:44,959
You can only live like this?

70
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:48,225
You have so much, and you
have a man who loves you.

71
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,426
<i>Why's your heart so poor and twisted?</i>

72
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:55,856
President Nam is also your object
that you used to abandon?

73
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,389
Love in the end is a game.

74
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,025
<i>After you lose the game,</i>

75
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,011
just admit that you lost,
then you wouldn't be sad.

76
00:06:04,272 --> 00:06:08,650
If you feel so sorry for President Nam,
pick him up and use him.

77
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:12,541
You're a person who speaks with no value,
you don't seem like a woman.

78
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:18,443
This time I've hated you.
But today I feel bad for you.

79
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:22,903
You let your mom in pain after giving
birth to you, just to live like this?

80
00:06:23,136 --> 00:06:26,329
You're a pitiful person.

81
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,648
Why did you come here?

82
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,243
Why is it so difficult to contact you?

83
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,183
Did you go to Doctor Jun's?

84
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:49,056
Yes, but.

85
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:51,739
Then you should know
Hyun Woo Hyung is still alive.

86
00:06:51,922 --> 00:06:54,711
Now you have no other choice.

87
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,575
Plane ticket for a week after.

88
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:02,206
Arrange everything and leave this place.

89
00:07:02,403 --> 00:07:03,922
The faster the better.

90
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,026
Now you're letting me go
with you to a foreign country?

91
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:09,695
Madam's actions are abnormal.

92
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:13,438
Our actions being found
out is a time's problem.

93
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,448
You'll leave with me, right?

94
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:19,243
If you reject,

95
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:27,960
then find President with these
photos, and tell the truth.

96
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:39,089
Are you threatening me now?

97
00:07:39,185 --> 00:07:41,158
Choose.

98
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,060
Stay here trapped with crimes,

99
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:47,629
or leave and start a new life.?

100
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,997
I don't care which side.

101
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:53,436
As long as I'm with you, I don't care.

102
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,125
Arranging the business isn't hard,

103
00:07:57,267 --> 00:08:00,012
but we need to find Kyeong Ran.

104
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:04,557
There's almost an answer.
Give me some time.

105
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,569
Then, stay at my apartment from now on.

106
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:09,574
This place is too dangerous.

107
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:15,615
No, Mom knows Kyeong Ran's traces.

108
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:19,165
After my parent's incident, she
seems to have taken Kyeong Ran.

109
00:08:19,308 --> 00:08:21,936
We have to find her no matter what.

110
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:26,908
Okay. Take care of your
health. Get her tight.

111
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:33,953
This, what ring is this?
Never seen it.

112
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,065
It was pretty, so I bought it.

113
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:40,837
Hurry and go. Someone might
come out of the house.

114
00:09:00,026 --> 00:09:03,877
<i>Tomorrow in the cafe in front of the community
cafeteria, if you don't bring Kyeong Ran out,</i>

115
00:09:03,997 --> 00:09:09,627
<i>then I'll bring the police officers in
your house then see what you'll do.</i>

116
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:26,890
<i>At first I wanted to make the present
better, but you found out.</i>

117
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,324
<i>Because I thought of Ah Ran
while making it,</i>

118
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,395
<i>be happy and receive it.</i>

119
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,575
<i>I love you. Jae Sung.</i>

120
00:10:24,628 --> 00:10:28,383
Marry me.

121
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:30,804
Plane ticket for a week after.

122
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:33,072
Arrange everything and leave this place.

123
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:45,748
That's right.

124
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,335
I won't let Joo Seung know. Leave this
place silently and it'll be okay.

125
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:57,022
The real love comes now,
it can't be blocked.

126
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:05,413
Mom, Mom, why are you in my room?

127
00:11:08,332 --> 00:11:11,962
Scary person, are you still considered a human?

128
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,691
What is this for?

129
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:15,490
The world's witches aren't like you.

130
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,732
Scary, tricky, dirty.

131
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,073
<i>One Hyun Woo isn't enough,
so you pulled out a Joo Seung.</i>

132
00:11:21,253 --> 00:11:23,457
Then you want to make Joo Seung cry?

133
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:28,207
What is your motive?
Who exactly are you?

134
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:35,737
Who am I?

135
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,629
I'm your daughter-in-law.

136
00:11:38,742 --> 00:11:43,034
Shin Hyun Woo's wife,
Joo Seung's lover.

137
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,145
<i>Looking at it, your destiny and
my destiny is pretty deep.</i>

138
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,517
Mom's son loved me.

139
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:51,316
Shut your dirty mouth.

140
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:54,037
I'm dirty?

141
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:02,657
Then what is this?

142
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,068
<i>Lying to Dad,</i>

143
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,175
<i>giving birth to a son of Dad's secretary.</i>

144
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,722
What qualifications do you have to blame me?

145
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,180
Everyone in the world can throw stones at me.

146
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:23,690
Only one person, only you can't do that.

147
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,405
Right, I deserve to die,
but your crime won't fade.

148
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,057
What did you do to Hyun Woo?

149
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,661
Tell me, tell me quickly.

150
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:38,754
If you want to know, check yourself.

151
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:45,894
If not, tell Dad. Ask for help.

152
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,617
So, Joo Seung will be safe, right?

153
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:52,911
Using Joo Seung as your captive
to cover your crime. Right?

154
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:56,328
So you're using Joo Seung?

155
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:03,296
You know why I became this
family's daughter-in-law?

156
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:06,638
<i>It's Joo Seung who sent me to this family.</i>

157
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:12,788
Because he wanted to take
revenge on you, so he used me.

158
00:13:13,342 --> 00:13:18,049
Feeling innocent isn't Mom's two sons.

159
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:24,941
It's me, Joo Ah Ran, you know?

160
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:48,032
This girl, came up so late.
Why do you look so sad?

161
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:52,294
What's wrong? Did something happen?

162
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:58,652
Is me seeking Ahjussi a bad thing?

163
00:13:58,861 --> 00:14:05,527
I have nothing, I can't help Ahjussi anymore.

164
00:14:05,934 --> 00:14:10,193
I should let him go now, right?

165
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:13,863
You girl. What's after the other?

166
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:16,293
Mr. Shin is in a very tiring state now.

167
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,679
You're grumbling about love?

168
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:23,227
I'm scared that he won't come back.

169
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:28,806
I trust Ahjussi, but Ahjussi's heart,
Ahjussi doesn't know himself.

170
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:33,142
If he still has feelings for his wife that he loves.

171
00:14:33,302 --> 00:14:35,970
Then what should I do?

172
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:38,644
Stepping on your own life.

173
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,455
How can he love a woman that
turned his whole world around?

174
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,560
Mr. Shin isn't a rash person.

175
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,143
<i>Among the children who my husband raised,</i>

176
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:53,956
<i>is there one named Joo Kyeong Ran?</i>

177
00:14:54,163 --> 00:14:59,972
Right, have you ever heard
the name Kyeong Ran?

178
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:05,238
Kyeong Ran? No, I don't know.

179
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:08,134
Actually, daytime.

180
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:14,952
No, what am I thinking?
Hurry and get the blankets.

181
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:21,748
Dad, Mom.

182
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:24,970
<i>Now I can do it.</i>

183
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:28,238
I'll come back soon.

184
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:04,882
Actually, I'm the little lantern from the
Angel Orphanage that Madam supports.

185
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,744
If you don't bring Kyeong Ran out,
I'll bring police to your house.

186
00:16:08,824 --> 00:16:12,503
Then what will you do?

187
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,318
Hyun Woo Hyung died because the gas
Madam opened and let go exploded.

188
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:19,387
<i>Like that, Madam killed two children.</i>

189
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,199
<i>Joo Seung sent me to this family.</i>

190
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:25,589
Because he wanted to take
revenge on you, so he used me.

191
00:16:34,337 --> 00:16:38,345
<i>No, no matter what I have
to go and resolve this.</i>

192
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:42,185
<i>If Hyun Woo's dad finds out,
he'll kill everyone.</i>

193
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:27,428
What? The Angel Orphanage in Paju?

194
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:30,862
My wife went there now, right?

195
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,657
Okay. Good work.

196
00:17:42,225 --> 00:17:46,299
Aunt, it's me. Go to the place
I told you to go. Quickly.

197
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:49,651
That woman might want to hide
Kyeong Ran. Hurry and go.

198
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:52,734
What are you saying now?

199
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,023
Okay, I got it.
I'll go now.

200
00:17:56,272 --> 00:17:57,658
Hurry and get up.

201
00:17:57,837 --> 00:18:01,818
Now my shop and house are about to be taken away!

202
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,235
It's so early, where are you going?

203
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:10,509
So early, coming without
caring about my manners.

204
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:16,744
The child that I raised is
named Yoon Jae Hee.

205
00:18:16,992 --> 00:18:19,265
Yes, yes.

206
00:18:19,494 --> 00:18:26,824
That child is the nurse that
took care of my dead son.

207
00:18:27,547 --> 00:18:30,279
I'll ask for you one more time,

208
00:18:30,489 --> 00:18:34,137
you can't tell anyone that
I brought the child here.

209
00:18:34,307 --> 00:18:38,303
Don't even tell Jae Hee anything.

210
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:47,149
I have something to ask you.
Is Jae Hee's real name Kyeong Ran?

211
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,824
Yes. I don't know much about the child.

212
00:18:51,901 --> 00:18:59,758
Actually, your daughter-in-law
came looking for a Kyeong Ran.

213
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,767
My, daughter-in-law?

214
00:19:02,838 --> 00:19:05,526
I said I don't know the name, and she left.

215
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,986
But now that I think about it,

216
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:12,151
there used to be someone
looking for Kyeong Ran.

217
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:19,142
<i>Daughter-in-law knows about Kyeong Ran,
then who won't know this secret?</i>

218
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:24,016
<i>How many of my weaknesses do they know?</i>

219
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:37,150
<i>How did you come here?</i>

220
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:38,867
I called a taxi.

221
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:40,871
<i>We called a taxi because we were in the rush,</i>

222
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,155
but who know the fee was so expensive.

223
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:47,086
Oh, besides us, did anyone else come here?

224
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,254
Is there? I didn't see anyone.

225
00:19:56,466 --> 00:20:00,040
Looks like they just came.

226
00:20:00,903 --> 00:20:02,515
Ahjussi.

227
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:06,958
I thought it was a woman.

228
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,326
Let's go wait in the office.
They will come, let go in.

229
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:14,088
Okay.

230
00:20:19,297 --> 00:20:22,363
<i>I saw you weren't home,
so I came here to try my luck.</i>

231
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:26,874
I was worried when I came,
you look good.

232
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:35,602
You're okay?

233
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:40,415
<i>I let you go just like that yesterday,
I didn't get any sleep at night.</i>

234
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:46,375
Please go back. I'm on the
afternoon shift so,

235
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,799
I need to clean and wash the
children's clothes then I can go.

236
00:20:49,918 --> 00:20:51,524
Jae Hee.

237
00:20:52,371 --> 00:20:56,794
Saying I'm okay is a lie,
even if the revenge gets bigger,

238
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,743
you can't just take of our ring like that.

239
00:21:00,997 --> 00:21:06,468
I hate myself for not trusting you.

240
00:21:06,702 --> 00:21:10,008
So I won't say anything.

241
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,999
Jae...

242
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:26,877
The child before I think I've seen before.

243
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,607
What did you see? Hurry and come.

244
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:35,387
- I'm not wrong, I'm sure I've seen her.
- President, I'll go first.

245
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:41,782
Excuse me, sorry.
Can you drive me a little?

246
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:46,084
Anywhere is okay, just where
I can call a taxi will be fine.

247
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,064
Hello?

248
00:22:02,172 --> 00:22:04,169
<i>I want to confirm today's meeting.</i>

249
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:07,062
<i>You have to bring Kyeong Ran out.</i>

250
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:11,068
Okay, please don't come to my house.

251
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:15,045
If you do, you won't see your niece.

252
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:21,162
<i>Mom, why are you so anxious?</i>

253
00:22:21,318 --> 00:22:23,560
<i>Who is Jae Hee?</i>

254
00:22:23,748 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>Do you have a secret our family doesn't know?</i>

255
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,984
Okay, you can let me off here.

256
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,356
No, since I have to go back to Seoul, I'll drive you.

257
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:41,898
It's our first time meeting, I'm so sorry.

258
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:48,442
Um, but

259
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,693
Where did you buy this scarf?
I have the same scarf.

260
00:22:54,507 --> 00:23:00,157
It was a present.
But this scarf is for men.

261
00:23:00,343 --> 00:23:04,400
It was given by my son, my eldest son.

262
00:23:04,694 --> 00:23:08,480
Afraid that I was cold, worried about me.

263
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:12,678
<i>Mom, you know?</i>

264
00:23:13,098 --> 00:23:19,897
<i>Endure a little longer, I won't
let you cry because of me.</i>

265
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,459
Really? My eyes are about to fall out.

266
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,348
An ant didn't even come in.

267
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:29,293
You said you will bring Kyeong Ran,
then don't worry and wait.

268
00:23:29,443 --> 00:23:30,932
Okay, okay.

269
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:33,592
We're not even training a dog,

270
00:23:33,756 --> 00:23:36,233
what are we doing so early in the morning?

271
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:37,912
What did Ah Ran say?

272
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:41,196
She said when she sees that
woman, she'll come herself.

273
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:45,317
Ah Ran that girl, she has
no manners towards us.

274
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:47,550
To her own sister, she's as nice as can be.

275
00:23:47,737 --> 00:23:49,212
Right.

276
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:56,387
Jae Hee's Uncle is right.

277
00:23:56,596 --> 00:23:59,623
Tell Jae Hee, get a hold on Madam.

278
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:05,428
A kind person like Madam, what's the matter?

279
00:24:06,985 --> 00:24:11,748
What? Jang Heung Pension has 60% of the furniture
but we've collected none of the money?

280
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,732
How does this make sense?

281
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,611
They said they were unsure of
the originality of the designs,

282
00:24:15,716 --> 00:24:18,282
so they are going to pay after
all the furniture is set up.

283
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,908
Stupid, how can you manage
business when you're so stupid.

284
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,183
Besides pulling money outside,
you're not good at anything else.

285
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,716
Right, how is Joo Chul Min's brother's wife doing?

286
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:34,639
Even though we sent people to follow,

287
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:37,263
but she keeps going from sauna room to sauna
room, so I'm having a hard time finding her.

288
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,033
That slippery eel... wait until I get a hold of them.

289
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:42,100
I'll teach them a lesson.

290
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:45,480
I won't let them do anything bad anymore.

291
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:56,078
<i>Yeon Jae, it's me, Yeon Jae.</i>

292
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:14,680
President.

293
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:32,615
After the prince saves the princess, what happens?

294
00:25:33,442 --> 00:25:37,555
The princess saves the prince.

295
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:55,803
<i>Eat this spicy rice cake.</i>

296
00:25:59,915 --> 00:26:02,419
<i>Wake up.</i>

297
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,203
It's so early in the morning,
why are you sleeping?

298
00:26:06,516 --> 00:26:07,579
What?

299
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:14,277
So it was a dream. I should have
finished what I did, really.

300
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:21,593
Where did you go so early in the morning?

301
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,260
Jang Heung Pension.

302
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,380
If we go to America after we marry,
I have to arrange that.

303
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:33,870
Jae Sung is so busy, it makes me too anxious.

304
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,230
<i>I saw SM furniture's President Jung,</i>

305
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:38,914
I want to finish the talk about uniting,

306
00:26:39,109 --> 00:26:45,693
so if we unite, I hope Jae Sung comes to sign.

307
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,541
Me?

308
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:51,034
If I use my name,
it will only leave fuse behind.

309
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:56,347
If I say I owe ROBBINS debt,
then I can't use my name to find fault.

310
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:03,296
Since we're marrying, it doesn't
matter who's name we use.

311
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,304
We'll follow your safe plans to work.

312
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:12,008
I will listen to you and help you.

313
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:15,606
My parents keep urging me to marry early,

314
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,088
they said they want to
meet Ah Ran earlier.

315
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:24,314
Okay, I'll quickly arrange
my family and the company.

316
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:52,126
<i>Starting from now will be the real life?</i>

317
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:54,855
<i>I have the right to be happy.</i>

318
00:27:55,036 --> 00:27:58,285
<i>No one can envy my happiness.</i>

319
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:03,890
<i>I've been exhausted for so long,
it's about time to be happy.</i>

320
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:11,673
How is it? Did you decide?

321
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,317
You're a smart person.

322
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:17,492
You decided to go with Julie Jung, then Jung Sang Hwa.

323
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,715
I'm sure you settled things out in
a way profitable to everyone.

324
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:28,412
Yes, I just need you to follow two conditions.

325
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:32,917
Then SM furniture will be given to Soul.

326
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:38,014
Good idea. What are the two conditions?

327
00:28:38,457 --> 00:28:44,848
Kneel in front of my brother
and confess with your heart.

328
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:48,305
No matter how you argue,

329
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:54,231
you playing and using my brother is the truth.

330
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:56,907
Then let's do that.

331
00:28:57,367 --> 00:29:01,435
Since to me, he is a talented designer.

332
00:29:02,202 --> 00:29:03,807
What's the other condition?

333
00:29:04,007 --> 00:29:11,249
All the designs that Sang Mo designed,
please add his name.

334
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:20,221
Like that, he will rest in place in heaven.

335
00:29:20,863 --> 00:29:27,420
That isn't hard.
Is that all the conditions?

336
00:29:29,563 --> 00:29:35,905
Then tomorrow I will come
ready with a proposal, bye.

337
00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:49,462
Yes, we're waiting here.

338
00:29:50,396 --> 00:29:54,634
That woman still didn't come.
She just called saying she's almost here.

339
00:29:54,803 --> 00:30:01,480
I already said Kyeong Ran's sister is
almost coming, hurry and come.

340
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:05,947
Earning money is hard.
Why is it so complicated?

341
00:30:06,193 --> 00:30:11,130
It's a big money. All this
hard work is worth it.

342
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:15,260
Also, honestly, we don't need
to use our own money.

343
00:30:15,498 --> 00:30:17,821
Where can you find this type of business?

344
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:23,790
You're right huh. In honor of getting
a furniture store let's have a drink.

345
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:24,637
Okay.

346
00:30:25,094 --> 00:30:27,675
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

347
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,497
Okay, I got it.

348
00:30:53,793 --> 00:30:58,201
President, Joo Chul Min's brother's wife
seems to be near here.

349
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,828
Really? Hurry and turn back.

350
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,800
They still didn't come?

351
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:39,901
They said they'll be here for 10 minutes already.

352
00:31:40,124 --> 00:31:44,949
What kind of woman is that unreliable.

353
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:48,750
Since she said she's coming,
then she could be here soon.

354
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:53,726
We need to know anyways.

355
00:31:53,976 --> 00:31:56,501
So I'll tell you the woman who
took Kyeong Ran is my Mom.

356
00:31:56,786 --> 00:31:59,465
- What? Mom?
- What? Mom?

357
00:31:59,662 --> 00:32:04,488
Then, President Shin's wife took
our Kyeong Ran, right?

358
00:32:04,643 --> 00:32:06,973
Oh my god,

359
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,378
Having your parents killed in
the same day is too much,

360
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,549
<i>And now they've taken your sister?</i>

361
00:32:14,859 --> 00:32:18,374
This woman should be hit
and killed by lightning!

362
00:32:18,518 --> 00:32:21,854
But, how can you appear here right now?

363
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,331
Then, whoever's daughter you are,
will be found out soon.

364
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:28,230
It doesn't matter.

365
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:31,569
I just need to get a hold of my Mom's weak point.

366
00:32:31,727 --> 00:32:36,034
Mom won't say who's daughter I am so easily.

367
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,797
I don't know what you two
are saying. I'm busy, I'm going.

368
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,291
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

369
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:58,878
Why is Hyun Woo's wife seeing these people?

370
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,968
What did my father do to your family?

371
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,325
There has to be something innocent. I'll...

372
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,550
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

373
00:33:06,771 --> 00:33:08,580
Dad.

374
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:11,842
You know these people? Right?

375
00:33:12,087 --> 00:33:13,869
No.

376
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:17,872
No long ago there were threatening
phone calls, so I couldn't help but meet them.

377
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,322
At the end, I don't know what
they're talking about.

378
00:33:20,473 --> 00:33:24,674
Threaten? What are you threatening?

379
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:28,319
What? If you want to know something,
ask me personally,

380
00:33:28,435 --> 00:33:31,027
I will tell you.

381
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,457
Secretary Kang, what are you doing? Get them.

382
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,529
Yes, President.

383
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,216
It's your business again.

384
00:33:45,485 --> 00:33:50,886
Was this your plan? Did you hire
those people to get to me?

385
00:33:51,142 --> 00:33:54,857
Father, did you make any
huge mistakes in your past?

386
00:33:55,021 --> 00:34:00,625
Hearing from them,
Dad killed their brother's wife.

387
00:34:00,836 --> 00:34:01,849
Is that the truth?

388
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:03,771
What? Killer?

389
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:09,285
Since Dad already knows,
then please resolve it yourself. Then.

390
00:34:18,063 --> 00:34:21,219
They said they were workers from the factory

391
00:34:21,432 --> 00:34:27,298
You can't have purposely have killed
those unfortunate people, did you?

392
00:34:46,695 --> 00:34:50,269
Mom, you look pale.
Are you sick?

393
00:34:50,442 --> 00:34:52,949
I need to rest a little.

394
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:56,658
Who is it? Don't open the door to random people.

395
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:03,651
It's a delivery, I'll go get it.

396
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:13,376
What is this? It was delivered.

397
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:17,465
There's no address or name.

398
00:35:17,663 --> 00:35:19,709
Give me.

399
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:31,895
This is Hyun Woo, our Hyun Woo.

400
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:36,299
What Hyun Woo?
Are you talking about Oppa?

401
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:38,588
Oppa.

402
00:35:38,621 --> 00:35:40,815
What is this? What happened to his face?

403
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:43,999
Why is there a scar?

404
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,699
Mom, this is weird.

405
00:35:46,947 --> 00:35:51,131
Oppa was unconscious, how could
he stand with his two legs?

406
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,719
A dead person's picture.
How can this?

407
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:58,675
Mom, look here.

408
00:35:58,886 --> 00:36:03,207
The picture's date says December 15.

409
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,110
<i>When the mansion caught fire,
it was November 27.</i>

410
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,850
How can Oppa take a picture on that date?

411
00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:14,073
<i>There was a time at Yang Pyung Villa when
patient Shin Hyun Woo was conscious for a time</i>

412
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,635
Hyun Woo is alive.
He is definitely alive.

413
00:36:18,823 --> 00:36:21,505
This hospital clothes. Even if you
have the flip the hospital over,

414
00:36:21,698 --> 00:36:23,660
you have to find Hyun Woo. Hurry.

415
00:36:23,796 --> 00:36:28,049
Okay, I'll call Dad and Hyun Min Oppa.

416
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:31,379
Should I have to call sister-in-law too?

417
00:36:31,584 --> 00:36:35,215
No, don't tell Ah Ran anything.

418
00:36:35,432 --> 00:36:38,207
We have to find Hyun Woo, it's us.

419
00:36:38,437 --> 00:36:43,514
Hyung is still alive?
How can this happen?

420
00:36:43,894 --> 00:36:47,696
Is this real? You're not joking with me?

421
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:51,158
Okay, then I'll come.

422
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,825
President, what are you talking about?

423
00:36:57,471 --> 00:36:59,936
Yeon Jae, my brother's still alive.

424
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:03,039
After the fire, a picture from the hospital
was delivered to my house.

425
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,089
- Then Hyung is alive.
- Oh my god.

426
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:08,554
Wait, I have to go home.

427
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,575
Wait, wait. You can't drive in this excited state.

428
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,857
Alex, Alex, no, Relax. Relax.

429
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,632
Don't get excited. Calm down.

430
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:24,426
Don't worry. Leaving Yeon Jae herself, I won't leave.

431
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:26,622
I'll call you later.

432
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,734
Leaving me alone, won't leave.

433
00:37:32,257 --> 00:37:36,000
Does our President really like me?

434
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:41,214
<i>Children's Mom. Hyun Ji, where are
you? Is children’s mom, right?</i>

435
00:37:41,437 --> 00:37:44,865
Our Hyun Woo is still alive?
What's going on?

436
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:50,816
Dad, look at this, Hyung is
really alive. Hyung isn't dead.

437
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,729
I said so.

438
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,235
How can Hyun Woo die?

439
00:37:57,412 --> 00:37:59,109
What kind of son is that brat?

440
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:01,362
How can he disappoint his dad?

441
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:03,604
He made a mess in this family.

442
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,171
He can't just leave with no responsibility.

443
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,700
Husband, we have to hurry
and find Hyun Woo first.

444
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,036
The burns looks really serious.

445
00:38:10,053 --> 00:38:12,269
We have to first find hospitals specialized in burns.

446
00:38:12,421 --> 00:38:14,669
What are you doing? Separate.

447
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:18,222
From Seoul to Jeju Island,
go through all the hospitals.

448
00:38:18,446 --> 00:38:22,521
Secretary Kang, hurry and hire
some people. Find outside, hurry.

449
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,176
Yes, President.

450
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,283
I'll go with you.

451
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:33,421
But, Oppa is alive, how can there be no calls?

452
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:37,098
It can't be that he lost his memory, right?

453
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,135
Brat that lost this memory,

454
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:42,346
how can he remember the
address and send a picture?

455
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:47,369
Just wait, maybe he'll appear in front of us.

456
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,134
Husband, I have to go out.
Just a little while.

457
00:38:55,977 --> 00:39:00,202
Nurse Yoon, please tell me.

458
00:39:00,477 --> 00:39:05,152
Where's Hyun Woo. Nurse Yoon
knows where Hyun Woo is, right?

459
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,713
What are you talking about?

460
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:10,083
Which hospital is Hyun Woo in?

461
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,872
Nothing can happen to Hyun Woo.

462
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:13,936
I have to find him and bring him home.

463
00:39:14,137 --> 00:39:17,390
What hospital? Isn't Shin Hyun Woo already dead?

464
00:39:17,512 --> 00:39:19,409
A picture came from Hyun Woo.

465
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:22,100
Even though the face has some bunts,
the eyes, nose are perfectly normal.

466
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:24,362
And also, both legs are standing on the ground.

467
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,088
Nurse Yoon, go in and work.

468
00:39:29,944 --> 00:39:32,377
Yes, President.

469
00:39:42,321 --> 00:39:47,937
A picture came from Hyun Woo Hyung, is it true?

470
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,017
Tell me, did Ah Ran hide Hyun Woo somewhere?

471
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,415
After making my healthy son into a vegetable.

472
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:00,278
<i>Now turned to a dead person,
and took him away from us?</i>

473
00:40:00,961 --> 00:40:02,180
I will find him.

474
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:06,100
Because I am his mom,
I'll find him no matter what.

475
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:08,839
Because you're his mom,
so you're finding him, right?

476
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,574
Then who is my mom?

477
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:15,522
Your son is living good and roaming around.

478
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,665
Why are you acting like you don't know?

479
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:18,422
Why aren't you finding?

480
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:22,398
If it weren't for me protecting you, you
wouldn't be a person on this world anymore.

481
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:25,652
Me abandoning you is how I saved you.

482
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:30,585
Parents who abandon their children
always repeat like a crow.

483
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:34,490
Did you listen to a talk in college?

484
00:40:34,668 --> 00:40:36,227
Abandoning children,

485
00:40:36,398 --> 00:40:41,622
is for the best choice for the child, is it like that?

486
00:40:42,197 --> 00:40:44,969
Don't treat Hyun Woo as
a opponent and be jealous,

487
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,996
<i>you don't have that qualification.</i>

488
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:53,714
Because of you and Ah Ran,
innocent children are suffering.

489
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:57,153
But Hyung has a lot.

490
00:40:57,641 --> 00:41:04,214
A proper family, proper manners.

491
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:08,601
And also a mom.

492
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,692
Why did you like me?

493
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:43,490
You knew that I was a married woman,

494
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:47,528
why were you so stupid and chose me?

495
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:02,487
I won't ask for your forgiveness.

496
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:08,454
I'll let your heart hurt, I'm sorry.

497
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:21,851
This is the trace that you once lived in this world.

498
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:24,570
Even though you left,

499
00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:31,535
the furniture that your designed
will remain forever. I guarantee.

500
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:43,444
Here. It's the document stating
that SM will be given to Soul.

501
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:51,316
Even though my brother was
unfortunate, you are really lucky.

502
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:57,278
Company and men are following your wishes.

503
00:42:57,782 --> 00:43:02,559
Because of the pain I've experienced,
I'll apologize to you with my heart.

504
00:43:02,702 --> 00:43:07,421
To not disgrace Sang Ho's designs,
I'll take good care of Soul Furniture

505
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,696
You're not picking up?

506
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,825
It's a phone call that will give
a headache, I won't worry about it.

507
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:30,446
After we marry, we have to live
in America for a bit. Don't worry.

508
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:33,366
After daughter-in-law comes,
my parents won't care about anything.

509
00:43:33,566 --> 00:43:35,285
They say they want to go on a vacation.

510
00:43:35,444 --> 00:43:39,305
Really? How good.

511
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:44,314
But isn't she curious about me?

512
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,600
No. She absolutely trust my insight.

513
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,471
As long as it's the person I love,
then there are no conditions.

514
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:15,209
Nurse Yoon, try to contact Ahn Jae Sung, it's urgent.

515
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:20,366
He won't pick up my calls.
Now we're not related.

516
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:23,447
You really don't know where Hyun Woo Hyung is?

517
00:44:23,817 --> 00:44:27,210
Like Madam said, which hospital is he in?

518
00:44:27,384 --> 00:44:30,912
This... I don't know.

519
00:44:33,023 --> 00:44:37,127
I'll leave first. After you're done you can leave.

520
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:49,251
Ahjussi, why is it like this?

521
00:44:49,417 --> 00:44:52,762
Now everyone knows Ahjussi is alive.

522
00:44:52,966 --> 00:44:57,253
I'm afraid something will happen.
I'm about to go crazy.

523
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,244
Please help me confirm,

524
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:16,841
is there a person named
Shin Hyun Woo who came here?

525
00:45:17,037 --> 00:45:19,990
He might have had a overall make-over.

526
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:22,224
Please help be check the patient record.

527
00:45:22,494 --> 00:45:24,854
Okay, please wait.

528
00:45:28,418 --> 00:45:30,971
You say Shin Hyun Woo, right? This patient...

529
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:32,803
We don't have that patient.

530
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:36,186
Our hospital is afraid of the risk,
we don't do overall make-over.

531
00:45:36,282 --> 00:45:40,237
Lies. Did Shin Hyun Woo tell you say this?

532
00:45:40,466 --> 00:45:44,478
I... saw Shin Hyun Woo come out of this hospital.

533
00:45:44,605 --> 00:45:47,593
Tell me, I have to know.

534
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:53,537
If you came to mess,
I will call the police. Please leave.

535
00:46:11,188 --> 00:46:12,403
I'm finding someone by the name of Shin Hyun Woo,

536
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:15,125
he's received a make-over surgery.

537
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:17,911
Even if you have to go through
the whole world's records,

538
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:19,883
you have to help me find him.

539
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:21,423
A patient named Shin Hyun Woo,

540
00:46:21,534 --> 00:46:22,889
has he come to his hospital before?

541
00:46:23,192 --> 00:46:25,010
He has a severe burn on his face,

542
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:27,228
please look thoroughly through the records.

543
00:46:33,729 --> 00:46:38,221
Jae Sung, what is all this?

544
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,842
The schedule is too tight,
so I made a decision.

545
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,154
Sorry for not discussing it with you first.

546
00:47:03,159 --> 00:47:05,610
It's so pretty.

547
00:47:12,532 --> 00:47:16,845
Compared to me, you know how to pick jewelry more.

548
00:47:17,287 --> 00:47:20,809
I was worried that you wouldn't like it. Thanks for your praise.

549
00:47:21,067 --> 00:47:23,471
Do you need to invite a lot of people
during the wedding ceremony?

550
00:47:23,693 --> 00:47:28,921
No, my family is the orphanage.

551
00:47:29,158 --> 00:47:34,970
I also have a little sister,
but she won't make it.

552
00:47:35,868 --> 00:47:40,834
Then, one invitation card should be enough.

553
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:50,508
You even booked the church already?

554
00:47:51,155 --> 00:47:53,033
But, how can you be so fast?

555
00:47:53,257 --> 00:47:55,517
Since we are going to marry,
there's no need to delay it.

556
00:47:55,675 --> 00:47:58,048
On my side there's only my parents and brothers coming.

557
00:47:58,172 --> 00:48:01,000
There's no special arrangements.

558
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:08,684
This day at this time, leave some time out.

559
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:13,985
This day, is the day I become your man.

560
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:29,203
Thank you. I will be your good wife for my whole life.

561
00:48:29,471 --> 00:48:34,638
<i>I'll help your occupation,
I won't hide anything from you.</i>

562
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,361
Even when I turn old,

563
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:39,742
I still need to be the cool woman by your side.

564
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:46,695
You won't hide anything, just
thinking of it makes me feel happy.

565
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:48,332
Let's go to the next place.

566
00:49:00,695 --> 00:49:02,356
It's so pretty.

567
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:05,325
Within the brides that I've seen,
you're the prettiest.

568
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,143
I like the wedding dress a lot.

569
00:49:08,306 --> 00:49:11,786
A person who has never married, how
do you know a woman's heart so well?

570
00:49:11,966 --> 00:49:16,539
I don't know much about woman's heart.
But i know some about Ah Ran's heart.

571
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,290
<i>Joo Ah Ran. Laugh more.
Be happy more.</i>

572
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,836
<i>If I need to shatter your happiness miserably,</i>

573
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:31,457
<i>I need to go up a little more.</i>

574
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,577
Jae Sung, hurry and try out your suit too.

575
00:49:36,786 --> 00:49:40,962
I want to see how handsome
you look, hurry and change.

576
00:49:41,105 --> 00:49:43,279
Then okay.

577
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:02,509
It's me.

578
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,436
Why weren't you picking up my calls? Where are you?

579
00:50:06,612 --> 00:50:10,623
Right now I'm discussing the uniting with Julie Jung.

580
00:50:11,288 --> 00:50:12,502
What's the matter?

581
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:14,193
Hyun Woo appeared.

582
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,440
The whole family is looking for Hyun Woo in the hospitals.

583
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:18,913
What's the meaning?

584
00:50:19,152 --> 00:50:21,349
He took a recent picture and mailed it home.

585
00:50:21,507 --> 00:50:23,306
Let's meet up now.

586
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:25,928
Hyun Woo Hyung, he might come home tonight.

587
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:27,678
<i>Then we will be over.</i>

588
00:50:27,773 --> 00:50:35,178
No way, send a picture?
Shin Hyun Woo is already dead.

589
00:50:35,352 --> 00:50:38,228
The gas exploded, how is it
possible to still be alive?

590
00:50:38,466 --> 00:50:43,654
The details I'm not sure, but it's
confirmed that Hyun Woo is still alive.

591
00:50:44,515 --> 00:50:49,668
We need to find your way out.
Are you listening to me?

592
00:50:55,473 --> 00:50:57,353
Ah Ran.

593
00:50:58,836 --> 00:51:00,876
How am I?

594
00:51:05,553 --> 00:51:09,255
What's the matter? Are you okay?

595
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:17,980
I wanted us to look at the church.

596
00:51:18,264 --> 00:51:21,239
Looks like we can't today.

597
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:28,516
Sorry. Everything might have been
too sudden, so I got frightened.

598
00:51:33,427 --> 00:51:38,269
Before the wedding ceremony,
you absolutely cannot faint.

599
00:51:38,445 --> 00:51:44,632
I have to see your pretty,
happy expression in the church.

600
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:47,676
Don't worry.

601
00:51:49,587 --> 00:51:52,557
I'll be okay soon.

602
00:52:00,933 --> 00:52:04,792
How is it? Did you go to the hospital?
Did you find Hyun Woo?

603
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:08,230
I don't think he's in Seoul hospitals.

604
00:52:08,577 --> 00:52:09,674
None.

605
00:52:09,886 --> 00:52:11,679
I've been asking around in
the regional hospitals

606
00:52:11,705 --> 00:52:13,515
There should be news soon.

607
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:17,827
No matter where, how, him being alive is the most important.

608
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:20,790
But, sister-in-law doesn't know about this?

609
00:52:20,883 --> 00:52:24,275
This time we received divorce papers,
so what if she knows.

610
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:28,309
Thinking about this, there are many weird things.

611
00:52:28,506 --> 00:52:31,109
the gas exploded and the house is gone.

612
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:33,731
Oppa who can't move is fine.

613
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:35,576
This can't be explained.

614
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:39,645
<i>At the scene, they found Oppa's tooth. How is that?</i>

615
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,182
Right. If Hyung didn't wake up and escape,

616
00:52:43,306 --> 00:52:46,293
how is he fine in the picture?

617
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:50,109
Hyung can't have a consciousness, right?

618
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:51,921
It's not an impossible thing.

619
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,169
If Joo Seung Oppa and sister-in-law were lovers,

620
00:52:55,496 --> 00:52:58,156
they couldn't take care of Hyun Woo Oppa.

621
00:52:58,307 --> 00:53:02,739
<i>Even if Hyun Woo Oppa woke up,
it's possible that he didn't tell us.</i>

622
00:53:03,007 --> 00:53:08,477
Then, the fire, was it purposely set?

623
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,184
<i>The bolt found in the mansion,</i>

624
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,454
<i>wasn't it locked from the outside?</i>

625
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:15,893
When Hyun Woo comes back,
everything will make sense.

626
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:17,891
That brat, what condition is he in?

627
00:53:18,038 --> 00:53:21,826
His own mom faced the trouble of
being accused of killing her own son

628
00:53:22,007 --> 00:53:23,852
and he still won't come home.

629
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:26,751
<i>If it goes on, what something
happens to his parents.</i>

630
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:31,477
Maybe, Hyung won't come
home because of sister-in-law.

631
00:53:31,721 --> 00:53:35,230
If sister-in-law locked Hyung in there,

632
00:53:41,849 --> 00:53:44,309
How is it? Did you find Shin Hyun Woo?

633
00:53:44,543 --> 00:53:46,398
He's hiding on purpose,
how can we find him?

634
00:53:46,507 --> 00:53:48,726
He's probably hiding behind laughing at us.

635
00:53:48,814 --> 00:53:50,869
Then, we can't just let go and not care.

636
00:53:51,466 --> 00:53:53,328
No matter what, we have to find him first.

637
00:53:53,508 --> 00:53:55,161
Even if it looks like hospital, we have to search.

638
00:53:55,383 --> 00:53:59,966
Maybe it's not a hospital, it's besides us.

639
00:54:00,118 --> 00:54:02,806
You're talking about President Ahn again?

640
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:05,057
It's not President Ahn.

641
00:54:05,234 --> 00:54:08,297
Just in case, I confirmed,
it's can't be Shin Hyun Woo.

642
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:10,355
<i>He doesn't have acrophobia.</i>

643
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,685
He doesn't have an appendectomy scar
and he doesn't have a peanut allergy.

644
00:54:12,773 --> 00:54:15,220
If he had a make-over because of revenge,

645
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:16,885
he would throw away Shin Hyun Woo totally.

646
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:19,267
There's no evidence that he had a make-over.

647
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:20,479
I asked the health insurance,

648
00:54:20,573 --> 00:54:24,595
to check if there was Shin Hyun Woo's medical record.

649
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:27,771
Tomorrow, everything will be found out.

650
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:32,829
Help me, Joo Seung. If Shin Hyun Woo
is alive and comes back,

651
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:38,808
the car accident, and the Yang
Pyung Villa fire will be exposed.

652
00:54:39,294 --> 00:54:46,893
If they know that Shin Hyun Woo is alive,
the family isn't telling me anything.

653
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,237
Maybe they've contacted him a while ago.

654
00:54:53,197 --> 00:54:56,406
Shaking here worriedly can't change anything.

655
00:54:56,682 --> 00:55:02,458
We can only arrange everything here,
and leave this place.

656
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:11,441
The play ended like that?

657
00:55:11,887 --> 00:55:17,263
It's missing the credits.
That will be our play's climax.

658
00:55:17,402 --> 00:55:20,172
Doctor Nam keeps being suspicious.

659
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,263
what will happen if he doesn't make it to the credits?

660
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:28,623
In the end, God will help the
righteous people. Including Sang Mo.

661
00:55:36,185 --> 00:55:39,142
<i>Ahjussi, I laughed a few times today.</i>

662
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:42,076
<i>Even though I'm tired, I'm still doing good.</i>

663
00:55:42,244 --> 00:55:47,639
<i>Before you sleep, think about
me and laugh once. Jae Hee.</i>

664
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:51,200
<i>[You cannot miss when you eat. You have to eat rice with brazed cow meat.</i>

665
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,819
<i>[When Ahjussi is sick, I'll be more hurt]</i>

666
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,177
<i>[Ahjussi, you have to drink milk everyday]</i>

667
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:57,637
<i>[For a cold, drinking water is the best,</i>

668
00:55:57,764 --> 00:56:00,730
<i>[You have to drink 1L everyday]</i>

669
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,711
Ahjussi, no matter what your motive is,

670
00:57:01,917 --> 00:57:07,100
marrying Joo Ah Ran twice, I oppose.

671
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:13,875
I have to tell the family about your existence.

672
00:57:29,703 --> 00:57:31,592
Ahjussi.

673
00:57:32,063 --> 00:57:37,745
You're not home. It's so cold, why are
you outside? Hurry and go home.

674
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:42,084
Ahjussi's family is looking for you, you know?

675
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:47,251
Yeah, I sent a picture.
It's about time I go back.

676
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:50,143
But why do you have to marry Joo Ah Ran again?

677
00:57:50,263 --> 00:57:52,884
You can't. I'll block it.

678
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:55,202
This isn't revenge, it's not anything.

679
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:59,901
Why are you hurting yourself
and get deeper into danger?

680
00:58:00,201 --> 00:58:06,187
Jae Hee, even if you block it,
I have to marry Joo Ah Ran.

681
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:11,246
How can you say that?

682
00:58:11,652 --> 00:58:17,543
Without me, Ahjussi can still be happy? Is that it?

683
00:58:17,658 --> 00:58:22,253
Jae Hee, the person you love isn't Shin Hyun Woo.

684
00:58:22,578 --> 00:58:26,417
Ahn Jae Sung starting from the beginning,
was born to get revenge on Joo Ah Ran.

685
00:58:26,667 --> 00:58:29,155
Leaving you now, is Ahn Jae Sung,
not Shin Hyun Woo,

686
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,041
<i>why don't you understand?</i>

687
00:58:49,406 --> 00:58:52,030
Nurse Yoon, why did you come to my house?

688
00:58:52,356 --> 00:58:56,854
I wanted to know if you found patient Shin Hyun Woo.

689
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,690
Are you really curious because you don't know?

690
00:58:59,843 --> 00:59:03,528
Or are you using your innocent face
and acting like you don't know?

691
00:59:03,716 --> 00:59:05,298
Leave for today, there's nothing.

692
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,360
I'll tell you tomorrow at the hospital.

693
00:59:18,702 --> 00:59:26,055
Right, the one marrying Joo Ah Ran is Ahn Jae Sung.

694
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,405
I don't need to feel hurt.

695
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:35,893
Let Ahn Jae Sung leave, then Shin Hyun Woo.

696
00:59:36,528 --> 00:59:43,704
I just need to wait for my real,
Daddy Long-legs and it'll be fine.

697
00:59:53,524 --> 00:59:55,704
What is this place?

698
00:59:55,849 --> 00:59:57,727
You two dare come in our house together?

699
00:59:57,851 --> 01:00:00,665
And you're trying to leave so quickly.

700
01:00:02,368 --> 01:00:06,205
Today, I have to take Ah Ran
away from this family.

701
01:00:06,382 --> 01:00:08,638
What? Hyung, are you crazy?

702
01:00:08,867 --> 01:00:10,952
Hyun Woo Hyung being alive is already confirmed.

703
01:00:11,072 --> 01:00:12,907
In the divorce procedure, Ah Ran.

704
01:00:13,118 --> 01:00:15,027
has no reason to stay in this family.

705
01:00:15,334 --> 01:00:17,646
You scary person.

706
01:00:17,863 --> 01:00:22,678
Because of this wretched woman,
you want to end relations with our family?

707
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,406
Thank you. now my ears have been yelled at.

708
01:00:28,571 --> 01:00:31,423
I don't need to feel sorry anymore. I can leave.

709
01:00:31,683 --> 01:00:35,114
Actually when we marry, we don't need to get President's permission.

710
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:37,368
I came because of the kindness these days.

711
01:00:37,462 --> 01:00:40,737
Doctor Nam, how can you say that?

712
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:42,898
Hurry and disappear from our eyes.

713
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:46,822
Go and make a family, or have
10 children, we won't care.

714
01:00:47,049 --> 01:00:50,795
<i>Don't ever appear in
front of us in your life.</i>

715
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:54,138
Go up and pack your things.

716
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:00,369
Hyun Ji, go prepare the rice.

717
01:01:00,545 --> 01:01:03,643
At times like this we need to eat, to cheer us up.

718
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:06,228
If you won't want that brat to play with us,

719
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:10,780
the whole family needs to cheer up.

720
01:01:16,996 --> 01:01:20,226
How are you? See if you need to bring anything.

721
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:23,572
Passport and checkbook you have to bring.

722
01:01:28,196 --> 01:01:31,362
<i>Right, if Shin Hyun Woo comes back,</i>

723
01:01:31,551 --> 01:01:34,462
<i>the only one that can help me block is Nam Joo Seung.</i>

724
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:37,738
<i>First I need Nam Joo
Seung's help to live on,</i>

725
01:01:37,953 --> 01:01:42,865
<i>then I'll marry Jae Sung,
and quietly leave this place.</i>

726
01:01:43,118 --> 01:01:49,381
<i>Nam Joo Seung, since we have
to go different roads anyways,</i>

727
01:01:56,726 --> 01:01:58,114
<i>[Statement</i>

728
01:01:58,317 --> 01:02:00,490
<i>I, Shin Hyun Woo, October 13...]</i>

729
01:02:25,452 --> 01:02:27,795
<i>You're tired.</i>

730
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:33,193
Let me leave this place quickly.

731
01:02:33,665 --> 01:02:36,857
<i>I don't have the energy to breathe.</i>

732
01:02:38,702 --> 01:02:41,829
Change any of my assets
you can into cash,

733
01:02:41,978 --> 01:02:45,278
and deposit it in my bank account.

734
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:49,663
Okay.

735
01:02:53,489 --> 01:02:56,253
This place is full of our memories.

736
01:02:56,497 --> 01:03:00,261
After a few days, this
place would also be gone.

737
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:05,856
Occasionally I will miss this place.

738
01:03:08,181 --> 01:03:13,474
Rest for a while. I need to meet a person.

739
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:28,953
<i>[Nam Joo Seung]</i>

740
01:03:37,155 --> 01:03:40,310
I, who grew up without a mother,

741
01:03:40,578 --> 01:03:44,372
has a person who takes
care of me like Hyung.

742
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:56,027
Compared to my busy father,
I liked that Hyung more.

743
01:03:56,344 --> 01:03:59,845
<i>He was a deep loving and warm person.</i>

744
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:04,874
But, starting from a time,

745
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:09,703
that Hyung became the person
I hated the most in the world.

746
01:04:10,091 --> 01:04:14,095
Why? Is it because of Joo Ah Ran?

747
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:16,625
No.

748
01:04:17,183 --> 01:04:20,401
You can say I'm a child that has
never drank his mom's milk.

749
01:04:20,685 --> 01:04:25,312
I have a sense of inferiority to child
who get their mother to themselves.

750
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:30,379
I don't know what it is,
but I really feel inferiority.

751
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:33,312
Let me ask one thing.

752
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:37,518
Feeling betrayed from the woman you love and

753
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:41,323
feeling betrayed from the parents
who gave birth to you,

754
01:04:41,517 --> 01:04:44,408
which one is deeper.

755
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:51,860
Yes, because I've never been
disappointed by my parents.

756
01:04:52,652 --> 01:04:56,445
Right, giving birth until now,

757
01:04:56,672 --> 01:04:59,987
I've never felt hurt or betrayed once.

758
01:05:00,204 --> 01:05:02,880
So, the feeling I get from Ah Ran,

759
01:05:03,057 --> 01:05:05,376
will hurt even bigger.

760
01:05:05,467 --> 01:05:06,333
What?

761
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:08,355
Do you know?

762
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:10,967
The cruel mother lion,

763
01:05:11,137 --> 01:05:15,424
to raise their children strong,
will bite the weak lions to death.

764
01:05:15,701 --> 01:05:17,858
The happiness that you're enjoying,

765
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:21,389
might be the value for stepping
into someone else's life.

766
01:05:21,607 --> 01:05:27,723
So, your happiness, isn't timely,
it's also not pretty.

767
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:29,227
What are you talking about now?

768
01:05:29,406 --> 01:05:32,926
I endure one punch, and another punch,
what's bad about that?

769
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:37,609
Lastly, the person who hit be first
wasn't Ah Ran, it was Hyung, you.

770
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:41,067
<i>Hyung thinks that the punch
he suffered was the biggest.</i>

771
01:05:41,298 --> 01:05:44,964
But, Hyung's sharp knife tip,

772
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:48,849
didn't hurt Ah Ran and I the deepest.

773
01:05:49,031 --> 01:05:52,757
It will be Hyung's most loved family.

774
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,709
You're still not drunk,

775
01:05:55,894 --> 01:05:57,854
you still think that I'm Shin Hyun Woo?

776
01:05:57,957 --> 01:06:02,877
Hyung is lacking courage
and is being childish.

777
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:07,436
Might as well come back as Shin Hyun Woo,
and get your revenge properly.

778
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:11,051
If it's like this, I will also suffer.

779
01:06:12,826 --> 01:06:16,628
At the end, tomorrow,
everything will be made clear.

780
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:22,999
Acting as Ahn Jae Sung,
tonight will be the last time.

781
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:26,268
Enjoy it.

782
01:06:36,549 --> 01:06:42,201
I was the one that first hit.

783
01:06:51,121 --> 01:06:55,176
Today I'll arrange this house,
I'll also arrange the hospital.

784
01:06:55,310 --> 01:06:59,347
Although it's not a lot of money, it won't
be a problem starting over again.

785
01:06:59,496 --> 01:07:01,047
Don't worry too much.

786
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:04,062
Okay, I also need to go to the marketplace.

787
01:07:04,182 --> 01:07:08,430
Then I'll pack the things that
I need when I leave from Soul.

788
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,082
Are you Joo Ah Ran?

789
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:34,403
I'm a policeman.
Let's go to the office.

790
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,853
What's happening?

791
01:07:37,413 --> 01:07:39,469
The criminal that caused the
car accident on October 13th

792
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:41,694
that happened on the highway
from Seoul to Chang-An.

793
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:45,310
The real suspect is Joo Ah Ran's statement.

794
01:07:48,234 --> 01:07:49,926
Who wrote this?

795
01:07:50,139 --> 01:07:52,223
Shin Hyun Woo.

796
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:56,989
Shin Hyun Woo? It can't be.

797
01:07:57,193 --> 01:07:59,313
How can a dead person write a statement?

798
01:07:59,477 --> 01:08:01,978
Shin Hyun Woo's fingerprint
has been confirmed,

799
01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:03,624
talk when we get to the office.

805
01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:23,809
<i>If you hate us, you should have killed us,</i>

806
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:25,320
<i>why did you touch my son?</i>

807
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:28,866
You want to take away
what is precious to you.

808
01:08:29,317 --> 01:08:30,378
<i>You're lying to me until the end.</i>

809
01:08:30,498 --> 01:08:32,362
Who do you want to kill? Bring that man out.

810
01:08:32,573 --> 01:08:35,088
<i>Joo Ah Ran, to see you now, I come out.</i>

811
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,073
<i>Romeo who's heart was stolen.</i>

812
01:08:37,162 --> 01:08:37,902
It's Ahn Jae Sung.

813
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:40,470
<i>Before Ahn Jae Sung helped Shin Hyun Woo
take care of everything,</i>

814
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:41,858
<i>he went on a plane.</i>

815
01:08:42,107 --> 01:08:44,057
At the end he was caught by the bank's CCTV.

816
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:44,989
Even God is helping us.

817
01:08:45,098 --> 01:08:46,107
If I don't come out,

818
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,347
<i>then it's like giving wings to
someone who needs to escape.</i>

819
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,419
<i>Shin Hyun Woo, you're
finally showing your face.</i>

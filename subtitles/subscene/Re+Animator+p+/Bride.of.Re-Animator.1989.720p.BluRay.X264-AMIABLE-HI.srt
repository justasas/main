1
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:18,875
(Hill) West!

2
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,421
You bastard.

3
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,135
You did this to me.

4
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:33,683
But you'll not escape me.

5
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:37,186
Not this time!

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,065
(Laughs)

7
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,662
(Gunfire in distance)

8
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,915
(Helicopter overhead)

9
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,256
(Man speaking Spanish)

10
00:01:07,843 --> 00:01:10,095
(Airstrike sounds)

11
00:01:11,096 --> 00:01:14,058
(Patients whimpering)

12
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:18,396
- (West) Take this.
- It'll burst an artery.

13
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:21,232
If we don't remove this now,
he's going to go into cardiac arrest.

14
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,651
- Just be ready to clamp.
- If it doesn't hold...

15
00:01:23,735 --> 00:01:26,362
We have no choice, Dan!

16
00:01:26,446 --> 00:01:27,989
- (Patient groans)
- Now!

17
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:30,366
(Agonizing screams)

18
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:35,455
Jesus Christ! It didn't hold!

19
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:44,340
But his central nervous system
is still intact.

20
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,013
He might still prove to be useful.
More useful than he'd be otherwise.

21
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:58,979
(Explosions and gunfire)

22
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,619
(Patients moaning)

23
00:02:16,956 --> 00:02:20,418
We have to retreat!
The front lines have weakened.

24
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:22,587
(Grunting)

25
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:30,763
(Gunshot)

26
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:38,062
(Cain) Goddamn it, Herbert!
What are you doing?

27
00:02:38,145 --> 00:02:40,773
- You know what I'm doing, Dan.
- (Cain) Don't you ever stop?

28
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,151
(West) We may never again have access
to this volume of fresh subjects.

29
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:46,404
(Cain) Fascinating.
There's somebody...

30
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:49,074
- (Explosions)
- (Iguana hisses)

31
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:53,829
- Get away from those!
- What are you doing back here?

32
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:56,415
- Leave.
- Put that thing away!

33
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:58,500
This is too dangerous for all of us.

34
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,752
Where are you going?
We've got lots of work to do here.

35
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,713
Come on! Jesus Christ!

36
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:06,883
- She's right!
- She's wrong. We are close, Dan.

37
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:09,678
Reticular consciousness
is not just in the brain.

38
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:12,473
We know that, yes?
We've gone beyond that.

39
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,600
Look at this.

40
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:18,855
- These reptiles are the key, Dan.
- Yes.

41
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:22,316
You just still don't understand, do you?

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,028
This is no longer about
just reanimating the dead.

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,866
We will create new life.

44
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:32,785
- (Explosion)
- Hang on!

45
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:37,291
(Men shouting in Spanish)

46
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:38,917
Francesca?

47
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,254
Get out of here!

48
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:47,384
- Come on! Let's go!
- (Explosion)

49
00:03:48,594 --> 00:03:50,053
- Let's go.
- My notes.

50
00:03:50,179 --> 00:03:51,930
- Leave them!
- Wait!

51
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:54,516
- Forget it!
- We'll need this back home.

52
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,018
Come on!

53
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,444
(West) Dan?

54
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,499
(Men speaking Spanish)

55
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,431
Dan?

56
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,726
Well, you're going to be alright.

57
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,148
We've got to get out. Come on.

58
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,236
Come on. Let's go home.

59
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,501
- (Heart rate monitor beeping)
- (Door opens)

60
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,380
(Cain) Morning, Gloria.

61
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,765
- How's the star patient?
- Hello, Doctor.

62
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,437
You look great.
I see you even put on some make-up.

63
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,815
Don't tease me.
It's just that...

64
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:05,194
My head is about the only part of me
that's not sick.

65
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:13,077
- Excuse me.
- This is Dr. West.

66
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,706
He'll be coordinating with pathology
about your biopsy.

67
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,043
You're right.
That part of you is quite well.

68
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:24,423
I'm scared.

69
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:29,636
Don't worry. The surgery is routine.
I'll be taking real good care of you.

70
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,267
Come on.

71
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:56,164
(Pen clicking)

72
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,585
She's not an experiment.

73
00:09:00,668 --> 00:09:02,879
- She's terminal.
- She's a patient!

74
00:09:02,962 --> 00:09:06,382
- She could be of use to us, Dan.
- Not us! You.

75
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,512
- I'm a doctor.
- Well, be a scientist!

76
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:23,484
(Humming)

77
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,571
(Phone ringing in background)

78
00:09:36,081 --> 00:09:37,165
Yes?

79
00:09:50,887 --> 00:09:54,057
Lieutenant Leslie Chapham,
Arkham Police Department.

80
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,519
- Leslie?
- Lieutenant.

81
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:59,981
Well, how may I help you,
Lieutenant?

82
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,901
I understand you're in charge of the
remains from the night of the massacre?

83
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:07,947
Yes, but it's my understanding
that the case is closed.

84
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,491
Not to me.

85
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:25,883
It showed up in a carnival sideshow
just outside of Arkham.

86
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,593
Dr. Hill?

87
00:10:28,969 --> 00:10:32,306
Remarkably well preserved, considering
the massacre was eight months ago.

88
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:36,560
All the specimens from that night
exhibit the same qualities.

89
00:10:36,643 --> 00:10:40,564
Yes, as you see,
the skull is fractured right there.

90
00:10:40,689 --> 00:10:43,359
Didn't you know it was missing?

91
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:47,363
You know, I could fix that.

92
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,325
Where do you keep
the rest of the remains?

93
00:10:57,332 --> 00:10:59,792
The specimens from that night

94
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:03,630
have shown almost
no signs of deterioration.

95
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,550
This not only holds true
for the gross anatomy,

96
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:12,598
but the individual cells in each specimen
display a lack of decay.

97
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,185
Are you saying that
they're not quite dead?

98
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,729
What's dead is dead, Lieutenant.

99
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:22,107
I should know. It's my field.

100
00:11:28,447 --> 00:11:30,075
What's this?

101
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:33,286
That's something
Dr. Hill was working on.

102
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:37,666
I haven't been able to identify it.
Yet.

103
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,044
I was planning on doing that first thing
in the morning, as a matter of fact.

104
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,630
Is this all of it?

105
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:46,925
- Except for fragments and debris.
- What happened to that?

106
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,011
Why, we burned them, of course.

107
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,274
(Graves) Suicide.

108
00:12:02,358 --> 00:12:04,443
Would-be ballet dancer
didn't have the stuff,

109
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:07,697
- cut off her feet and bled to death.
- (Ernest giggles)

110
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:12,535
- Where are her feet?
- Her feet?

111
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:14,912
Why... they're missing.

112
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:20,085
A lot of stuff's been missing
from around here lately, Holmes.

113
00:12:21,878 --> 00:12:23,422
Body parts?

114
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:28,260
Really, Lieutenant?
Who'd want to steal body parts?

115
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,084
Yes!

116
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:11,221
Hm-mm...

117
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:38,541
How did you get back here?

118
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,296
(Chuckles)

119
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,968
Well...

120
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:51,305
...well, well.

121
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:01,273
What do you think of the location
of the will in the brain now, Dr. Hill?

122
00:14:02,817 --> 00:14:04,985
I'm sorry, what was that?

123
00:14:06,737 --> 00:14:09,698
Actually, you've been
quite useful to me.

124
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:15,038
You helped me prove that consciousness
resides in every part of the body.

125
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:20,919
You had such pretensions of grandeur,

126
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:24,840
you pompous plagiarist.

127
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:32,347
But look at you now.
You're nothing but a dead-head.

128
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,564
A no-body.

129
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,567
(Chuckles)

130
00:15:05,966 --> 00:15:09,386
- Did that police officer find you?
- Police?

131
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:12,890
Yes, he came by
while you were in surgery.

132
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:14,725
(Coughing)

133
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:20,147
You're gonna be alright...

134
00:15:22,274 --> 00:15:23,734
...Gloria.

135
00:16:01,357 --> 00:16:02,775
Herbert?

136
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:37,353
Herbert?

137
00:17:03,213 --> 00:17:04,798
Dan!

138
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,466
(Laughs)

139
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:07,968
Look at this!

140
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:13,348
We practically share a wall with
the Avril's crypt in the cemetery.

141
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,270
- Ew!
- Yes, that's a 150 years of decay.

142
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:21,189
Oh, well.

143
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,816
Dust to dust.

144
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:32,285
- What happened to our cadaver?
- I was finished with it.

145
00:17:32,368 --> 00:17:34,620
Would you help me with this,
please?

146
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,796
Security.

147
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:45,465
From what?

148
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,563
- Herbert, I've got something to tell you.
- Really?

149
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,024
I have something to show you.

150
00:18:24,964 --> 00:18:28,301
- (Iguana hisses)
- Shh...

151
00:18:31,054 --> 00:18:32,806
Look at that, Dan.

152
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:35,183
And no tissue damage.

153
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,731
It simulates a heart attack.
And it leaves virtually no trace.

154
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:48,906
(Cain) That's real useful
if you want to murder someone.

155
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,617
(West) It is very useful...

156
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,119
...in obtaining...

157
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,081
...the freshest animal specimens.

158
00:18:58,082 --> 00:18:59,835
Right here.

159
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,924
The amniotic fluid
of the Cuzco iguana.

160
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:09,678
Did you know that this reptile has
not changed significantly in over...

161
00:19:09,761 --> 00:19:12,722
...100 million years.
Herbert, I know this is important.

162
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:18,895
Now... we extract
the amniotic fluid from the sac.

163
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:23,151
With that,
we add the muscle proteins

164
00:19:23,234 --> 00:19:25,778
of myosin, actin and...

165
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:29,323
- Tropomyosin.
- Good.

166
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:32,410
And then...

167
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,621
(Bubbling sounds)

168
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:49,970
Our reagent.

169
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:05,903
Pure potentiality.

170
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:10,450
The primordial ooze
from which life originates.

171
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:21,044
Dr. Hill...
Dr. Hill gave me this idea.

172
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,673
(West giggles)

173
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm moving out.

174
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,572
What?

175
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:51,867
I'm moving out.

176
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:54,620
Dan...

177
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,707
You can't turn back now.

178
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:03,046
This... This is the key
to creating life!

179
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:06,967
- Parts! Reanimated parts!
- We're saving whole people, not parts.

180
00:21:07,092 --> 00:21:09,052
Exactly, and what are people, Dan,

181
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,556
over and above
a collection of living parts?

182
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:15,141
We can create...

183
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:18,144
...new life.

184
00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:39,458
This morbid doodling
with human body parts!

185
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,550
Is this what it's all about?
Is this what all our great work has led to?

186
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:48,510
- Exactly what are you insinuating?
- This is your madness!

187
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:50,470
It had nothing to do with me. I'm out!

188
00:21:50,554 --> 00:21:54,349
I didn't see you rejecting my work
when Meg was lying there dead!

189
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:57,227
- Where were your great ideals then?
- Don't you...

190
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:07,904
Daniel?

191
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,826
What was it about Meg that you loved?

192
00:22:33,265 --> 00:22:35,100
Meg's heart.

193
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:54,828
Help me... to continue the work.

194
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:19,897
We can create a new life.

195
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,487
Starting...

196
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:32,702
...with Meg's heart.

197
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,870
(Echoing heartbeats)

198
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,500
Yes.

199
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,131
Now, Dan...

200
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:48,635
You're going to have to help.

201
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,220
At the hospital.

202
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:57,185
- What about the police?
- No, the police will never come here.

203
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,312
(Door buzzer)

204
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,636
- Daniel Cain?
- Yes.

205
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:38,687
Police?

206
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,325
Come on in.

207
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,999
Is there a problem?

208
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:07,008
Who are you?

209
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:12,430
Dr. West.

210
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:17,393
- Lieutenant Chapham.
- Police.

211
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:20,439
(West) What do you want?

212
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:26,195
It's... quite an old place
you got here.

213
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:28,239
It used to be a mortuary.

214
00:25:28,322 --> 00:25:31,367
After the cemetery filled up,
it was the caretaker's house.

215
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,953
Nobody's been here for twenty years.

216
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:40,543
- Odd place to live.
- Has its advantages.

217
00:25:43,171 --> 00:25:44,881
Huh...

218
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,762
- Pretty morbid stuff.
- I don't consider science morbid.

219
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:54,307
It was pretty morbid
the night Dr. Carl Hill died.

220
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:56,476
And Dean... Dean...

221
00:26:00,647 --> 00:26:03,692
- Halsey.
- Dean Halsey. Yeah.

222
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,029
And Megan Halsey.

223
00:26:10,658 --> 00:26:12,994
Do you mind if I sit down?

224
00:26:16,914 --> 00:26:21,127
Dr. West, what kind of problems
did you have with Dr. Carl Hill?

225
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:24,922
Dr. Hill and I had
professional differences.

226
00:26:25,006 --> 00:26:27,842
It was nothing personal.
I have been all through this.

227
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:32,264
It's in the police records,
which I am certain you have access to.

228
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:36,768
(Chapham) I understand that
you have some radical ideas about...

229
00:26:37,561 --> 00:26:39,855
the reanimation of dead tissue?

230
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:45,152
When I was in medical school, I might
have had time to discuss the theory.

231
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:46,737
I don't anymore.

232
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:52,200
I suppose those poor souls
out at the Sefton Ward... are theory.

233
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:59,876
I don't know
what you're talking about.

234
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:10,637
And I suppose you don't know anything
about the missing body parts

235
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,722
at the hospital?

236
00:27:14,182 --> 00:27:16,392
Missing body parts?

237
00:27:19,063 --> 00:27:20,481
No.

238
00:27:25,653 --> 00:27:28,489
(Chapham) I can find my own way out.

239
00:28:37,936 --> 00:28:39,771
(Squawking)

240
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:03,588
(Screaming)

241
00:29:05,465 --> 00:29:07,425
(Wings flapping)

242
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,020
Get off! Get off!

243
00:29:20,439 --> 00:29:21,732
Get off me!

244
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:54,766
Ernest?

245
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:57,936
Dr. Graves wants to see you
right away.

246
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:00,396
- Pathology?
- Right away.

247
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,821
- What about the...?
- I'll take care of it.

248
00:30:08,405 --> 00:30:09,782
Cool.

249
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:55,204
(Hill grunts)

250
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:58,541
More.

251
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,085
Dr. Hill...

252
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:05,840
- Is that you?
- More!

253
00:31:21,106 --> 00:31:24,318
Dr. Graves.

254
00:31:25,694 --> 00:31:27,487
You... you see?

255
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:31,116
I recognize you.

256
00:31:32,117 --> 00:31:33,493
You do?

257
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:37,707
That seminar in Zurich...

258
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:39,167
Yes.

259
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:45,965
Your theory of reconciling
creationism...

260
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:50,470
with the origin of disease...

261
00:31:51,346 --> 00:31:52,347
Yes.

262
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:55,141
Totally idiotic!

263
00:32:15,329 --> 00:32:16,956
It's you. Come in.

264
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:24,588
No, no. No lights.

265
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:28,009
Come over here.

266
00:32:39,938 --> 00:32:42,274
Dr. Hill? Speak to me.

267
00:32:47,904 --> 00:32:50,783
Speak to me, Dr. Hill! Speak.

268
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:56,455
This is some kind of joke,
right, man?

269
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,042
No, it is not a joke!
He can talk.

270
00:33:00,126 --> 00:33:02,253
He heard my lecture in Zurich.

271
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:05,047
The head? He heard your lecture?

272
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,508
He can talk, for God's sake!

273
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:09,760
Listen.

274
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:12,597
Talk, damn it! Talk!

275
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,017
- Talk!
- The head...

276
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:29,906
Don't you ever do that again,
you mental midget!

277
00:33:30,782 --> 00:33:33,618
Oh, my God.
My God, I'm losing my mind.

278
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:38,916
I have some unfinished business.

279
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:44,505
And you will assist me.

280
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:49,677
(Cain) Not out the front door?

281
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,431
Just the doctor taking a patient out
for a little air.

282
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:04,109
(Dog barks)

283
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,236
- (Man) Man!
- (Woman) Oh, my God!

284
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,946
Herbert!

285
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:17,206
(Muttering)

286
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,003
(Dog whimpers)

287
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,133
Hey, pooch.

288
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,222
Yes! You said "Hi" to him!

289
00:34:32,347 --> 00:34:33,765
Francesca!

290
00:34:36,518 --> 00:34:37,769
Uh...

291
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:44,692
- Hi, Doctor.
- Hi.

292
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:48,656
Don't let the little head
rule the big head, Dan.

293
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:55,746
So, what are you doing in Arkham?

294
00:34:56,455 --> 00:34:59,375
Oh, I'm doing some
interviews in Boston this week.

295
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:02,878
(Paging System) <i>Dr. Cam, 5436.
Dr. Cain, 5436.</i>

296
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,548
- Oh, God. I've gotta go.
- I know.

297
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:08,843
Listen...
What about dinner tonight?

298
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,347
Only if you let me cook.

299
00:35:12,431 --> 00:35:17,769
- Real Italian style.
- Okay. Only if you let me help.

300
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:20,397
Real American style.

301
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,733
- It's a deal.
- See you tonight.

302
00:35:24,443 --> 00:35:27,487
Yeah. Hope you like garlic!

303
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:37,415
Well, Angel? What do you think?

304
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,462
Hey, pooch.
Where did you come from?

305
00:35:43,588 --> 00:35:45,256
From Peru.

306
00:35:45,381 --> 00:35:48,468
Is that where you met Dr. Cain?

307
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:53,681
Why do you want to know, Mr...?

308
00:35:53,764 --> 00:35:57,185
Oh, uh... Lee Chapham.

309
00:35:58,979 --> 00:36:00,606
Arkham Police.

310
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:04,067
Lieutenant.

311
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:09,740
I'd like to talk to you about him.

312
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:11,783
(Elevator bell)

313
00:36:12,784 --> 00:36:14,828
Did you ever hear of the "Miskatonic Massacre"?

314
00:36:14,912 --> 00:36:18,081
- No, I haven't.
- It happened here at the hospital.

315
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:23,213
Eight months ago, the department
got a call about a homicide

316
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,216
at the Miskatonic University hospital.

317
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:29,594
The whole place was in a panic.
It was down in the morgue.

318
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:32,263
There was blood all over the walls.

319
00:36:32,388 --> 00:36:34,724
You ever been around dead bodies?

320
00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:36,643
(Gasps)

321
00:36:38,311 --> 00:36:41,773
Then you know that stench
of decaying flesh.

322
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:46,445
Out of the darkness,
we were attacked by a naked maniac.

323
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:49,907
He jumped right on my partner
and bit his arm.

324
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,494
Nothing could make him come loose.
Tore the muscle right off the bone

325
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:56,121
before we pumped enough lead in him
to make him stop.

326
00:37:03,295 --> 00:37:06,340
The dean of the medical school
was down there.

327
00:37:06,423 --> 00:37:08,342
In pieces.

328
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,893
Also a prominent physician,
Dr. Carl Hill.

329
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:21,856
We found only his head.

330
00:37:21,982 --> 00:37:25,610
The rest of his body was
just part of the muck.

331
00:37:28,363 --> 00:37:30,282
Funny thing, though...

332
00:37:32,325 --> 00:37:34,996
His head, when I found it,
was still...

333
00:37:36,372 --> 00:37:37,832
...twitching.
<i> </i>

334
00:37:37,915 --> 00:37:39,125
Twitching?

335
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,252
The doctors had a lot
of highfalutin explanations.

336
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:44,714
Post-mortem involuntary spasm...
I don't know.

337
00:37:47,091 --> 00:37:49,719
But I've seen my share of the dead.

338
00:37:51,929 --> 00:37:55,308
And I never saw a twitching
like that before.

339
00:37:57,227 --> 00:37:59,771
They blamed it all
on these ones in here.

340
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:01,857
The funny thing is,

341
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,610
there's a death certificate
at the hospital for each one of these.

342
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:06,069
A death certificate?

343
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:10,240
I mean to say these three didn't get
to the morgue on their own two feet.

344
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:13,160
(Francesca)
The hospital made a mistake?

345
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:15,704
(Patients groaning)

346
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,914
(Door slams)

347
00:38:18,749 --> 00:38:22,128
The hospital might have made
a mistake about those two.

348
00:38:22,211 --> 00:38:24,005
(Groaning)

349
00:38:26,966 --> 00:38:30,178
Not... But not this one.

350
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:33,723
I know about this one.

351
00:38:35,767 --> 00:38:38,227
She was my wife.

352
00:38:39,062 --> 00:38:40,772
I'm sorry.

353
00:38:42,482 --> 00:38:43,941
Elizabeth, stop!

354
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:47,363
Get off me! Get off me!

355
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:49,615
(Screaming)

356
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:59,833
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm alright. Thanks.

357
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:05,089
That's enough.

358
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:07,591
She's never done
anything like that before.

359
00:39:07,676 --> 00:39:08,927
Just...

360
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:11,971
What does all this have to do
with Daniel?

361
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:16,101
Dr. Cain and Dr. West were
the only normal survivors of that night.

362
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:19,437
Daniel's girlfriend was Meg Halsey,
the dean's daughter.

363
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:24,025
And Daniel was found
with her dead body in his arms.

364
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,653
Her dead body.

365
00:39:27,654 --> 00:39:29,489
Twitching.

366
00:39:29,572 --> 00:39:31,575
Like that blasted head.

367
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:35,287
(Chirping)

368
00:39:37,373 --> 00:39:39,375
(Bubbling sounds)

369
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:54,890
Be careful not to use too much of that,
we don't want premature reanimation.

370
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:57,602
(Cain) Thank you,
I've never done this before.

371
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,450
Yes.

372
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,881
- (West) Good.
- (Gurgling sounds)

373
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,389
The circulation is going to work.

374
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,352
Goddamn it, Herbert!

375
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,984
What are we doing anyway?

376
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,904
Why don't we just publish our findings?
We could get grant money.

377
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,531
Because they would never
understand our methods.

378
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:52,284
Besides that,
they would steal the work.

379
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:55,871
It's never gonna work.

380
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,916
She's gonna be uncontrollably spastic.

381
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,794
Unless we reanimate all the limbs
at the same time, they'll separate.

382
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:05,172
That's why we inject
directly into the heart.

383
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,176
The circulatory system
should distribute the reagent

384
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:12,055
to all the various limbs
and effect reanimation concurrently.

385
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,099
- We've never done that before.
- I know that.

386
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,394
No, I don't want to gamble
with Meg's heart.

387
00:41:18,478 --> 00:41:20,563
(Door buzzer)

388
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,292
Oh, God...

389
00:41:42,211 --> 00:41:44,255
- <i>Ciao, dottore. Come va?</i>
- Francesca...

390
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:51,387
Sorry about the place.
I didn't have any time to...

391
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,808
- Did I come too early?
- No! No, no, no, uh...

392
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:56,768
God, you look great.

393
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,109
Open this up, will you?
It's a Chianti, 1987.

394
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,573
- Uh... so, where is the kitchen?
- It's right over here.

395
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:15,412
- Did you have any trouble finding it?
- Oh, no. The cemetery made it real easy.

396
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:34,473
(Francesca)
This is my special sauce.

397
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:36,142
Here.

398
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:43,942
- What do you think? You like it?
- I love it.

399
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:46,862
So do I.

400
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,146
Come on.

401
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,520
You're so beautiful.

402
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:05,318
Your skin's so soft.

403
00:46:09,114 --> 00:46:10,740
So warm.

404
00:46:42,482 --> 00:46:44,776
What are you doing here?

405
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:53,577
What do you want?

406
00:46:55,287 --> 00:46:57,789
The body you took
from the crematorium.

407
00:46:57,873 --> 00:47:00,333
Get out of here. Right now.

408
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:06,757
What's down here?

409
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:09,385
That's none of your business.

410
00:47:33,785 --> 00:47:36,246
You are making a big mistake.

411
00:47:37,789 --> 00:47:43,670
Do you believe that dead is dead,
Dr. West?

412
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:49,928
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I am talking about my wife!

413
00:47:51,596 --> 00:47:54,057
No! You can't go in there.

414
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,226
- Move.
- No.

415
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:57,936
Move!

416
00:48:47,237 --> 00:48:48,613
You...

417
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:51,825
...butcher!

418
00:48:51,908 --> 00:48:54,244
How dare you judge my work?

419
00:48:54,953 --> 00:48:56,454
"Work"?

420
00:48:58,456 --> 00:49:00,960
Was my wife your "work"?

421
00:49:01,085 --> 00:49:03,921
- Don't lay your guilt on me, Lieutenant!
- What?

422
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:06,716
Your wife died
of multiple contusions to the head.

423
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:08,426
- From a blunt instrument.
- No.

424
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,886
- Multiple blows to the head!
- She fell!

425
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,680
She fell, did she?

426
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:16,350
That was not my fault!

427
00:49:23,399 --> 00:49:26,111
(Heartbeat slows to a stop)

428
00:49:34,786 --> 00:49:38,206
- What happened?
- He attacked me.

429
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:41,877
No, Dan! Dan!
I can't help it if his heart gave out!

430
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,962
God, Herbert, he's a cop!

431
00:49:45,172 --> 00:49:46,631
You...

432
00:49:49,719 --> 00:49:53,431
- What are we gonna do with him?
- Well...

433
00:49:54,557 --> 00:49:57,602
We could get him
back out on the street.

434
00:49:57,685 --> 00:50:00,104
Walking.

435
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,986
You don't wanna gamble
with Meg's heart.

436
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,907
This is our opportunity for a test.
Do you wanna waste it?

437
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:21,418
How much do you think he weighs?
230, 240?

438
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:28,884
So little tissue damage.

439
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:31,136
Oh, Dan?

440
00:50:33,889 --> 00:50:35,975
Just in case.

441
00:50:46,111 --> 00:50:47,362
Daniel?

442
00:50:54,911 --> 00:50:56,913
It's working.

443
00:50:57,288 --> 00:51:00,584
- (Chapham mumbles)
- (Heartbeat grows louder)

444
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:06,424
Get away from me with that cloth!

445
00:51:08,801 --> 00:51:10,136
No! Dan!

446
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:19,186
He's a wife-beater, Dan!
Use the gun!

447
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:31,783
(Screams)

448
00:51:38,874 --> 00:51:40,792
(Skin sizzles)

449
00:51:44,212 --> 00:51:46,215
(Heartbeat continues)

450
00:51:48,342 --> 00:51:50,386
(Glass clinking)

451
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,158
Dan?

452
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:12,451
Herbert!

453
00:52:19,124 --> 00:52:21,126
(Chapham whimpers)

454
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:39,187
Lieutenant Chapham!
What are you doing here?

455
00:52:39,312 --> 00:52:40,813
(Snarling)

456
00:52:43,024 --> 00:52:45,109
Herbert!

457
00:52:54,285 --> 00:52:57,206
No! Stop!

458
00:53:03,587 --> 00:53:06,215
Get away from me! Get out!

459
00:53:06,715 --> 00:53:08,050
Get away!

460
00:53:27,112 --> 00:53:29,114
(Chapham grunts)

461
00:53:42,002 --> 00:53:44,922
- (Cain) What happened?
- (Sobs)

462
00:53:52,013 --> 00:53:56,684
- Is he gone?
- What is going on here?

463
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,858
What did you do to him
to make him that way?

464
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,360
She's hysterical.

465
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:10,741
What did you do to him? Why?

466
00:54:10,866 --> 00:54:13,035
(Anguished screams)

467
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:45,193
(Hooting)

468
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,741
(Dog barking)

469
00:55:27,696 --> 00:55:29,739
(Metal clatters)

470
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:54,473
What are you doing down here?

471
00:55:54,557 --> 00:55:58,686
Your welcome does not extend
to this part of the house.

472
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:01,480
(Francesca) Angel?

473
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:05,109
Sweetie...

474
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:07,988
(Screams)

475
00:56:09,364 --> 00:56:11,533
(Snarling and barking)

476
00:56:15,287 --> 00:56:17,038
Get out of my way!

477
00:56:17,164 --> 00:56:20,459
- You should never have brought her here.
- Get that thing out of here!

478
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:24,796
- Francesca, wait! Let me explain.
- Is this what you did to Meg?

479
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,299
You're a freak!

480
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:30,344
God, I hate you!

481
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,059
You're better off without her.

482
00:56:56,205 --> 00:56:58,832
Dan, now listen to me.

483
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:03,670
All we need is just one last piece.

484
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:07,257
Dan?

485
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,554
Gloria?

486
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:15,307
- Hi.
- (Heart rate monitor beeping)

487
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,525
How are you feeling today?

488
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:37,831
You see... it helps me
to think of you as Meg.

489
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:42,837
Meg who lived.

490
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:55,516
(Flatline tone)

491
00:58:00,437 --> 00:58:02,439
Nurse!

492
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:05,610
Paddles!

493
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:12,701
I didn't even notice.
God, what's wrong with me?

494
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,578
Let me through!

495
00:58:16,454 --> 00:58:18,415
Give me that!

496
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:20,876
Clear!

497
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,420
Push the lidocaine!

498
00:58:25,255 --> 00:58:26,715
Clear!

499
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:31,053
Forget it, Dan. Let's go in.

500
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:45,985
- She's never gonna survive this.
- She's already dead, Dan.

501
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:49,155
No, you're off midline.
Damn it!

502
00:58:57,623 --> 00:58:59,917
- (West) I'm getting nothing.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:02,836
- Come on!
- (Suction sound)

504
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:05,339
- Anything?
- Still flat.

505
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:10,135
- I'm calling it.
- No!

506
00:59:14,097 --> 00:59:15,974
Not again.

507
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,743
Go home.

508
00:59:36,955 --> 00:59:39,875
Go... home.

509
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:03,023
Yes. Come to room 613, right away.

510
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:19,958
(Wheezing and grunting)

511
01:00:41,188 --> 01:00:43,649
Damn you, West!

512
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:48,154
- Wilbur! Get me out of here!
- No.

513
01:00:48,237 --> 01:00:52,617
West took my body,
but he cannot take my mind.

514
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:54,703
Take me to him!

515
01:00:55,912 --> 01:01:01,168
No. Just don't talk.
Don't say anything.

516
01:01:01,752 --> 01:01:03,754
(Hill snarls)

517
01:01:04,629 --> 01:01:06,339
(Graves screams)

518
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:14,056
Don't make me get someone else.

519
01:01:14,514 --> 01:01:16,517
(Hill wheezes)

520
01:01:40,084 --> 01:01:43,170
What do you think you're doing?
Stop!

521
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:47,132
Do as I say, you nincompoop!

522
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:53,555
Come on, come on.

523
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:58,185
You're going away now.

524
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:07,570
Now, now...

525
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:15,078
(Door opens)

526
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:19,707
- Yo, Dr. West.
- Let's get this.

527
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:27,299
No, no. You get the feet.
I'll get the head.

528
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:37,852
Was she good-looking, Doc?

529
01:02:55,245 --> 01:02:57,330
You take this to the crematorium.

530
01:02:57,414 --> 01:02:59,916
The crematorium?
You mean pathology.

531
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,002
I mean the crematorium.

532
01:03:07,465 --> 01:03:09,593
Well, excuse me!

533
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,849
Excuse me,
have you seen Dr. Cain?

534
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,644
He left.
For the day, I think.

535
01:03:18,769 --> 01:03:22,565
- Is there something wrong?
- He's very upset.

536
01:03:22,648 --> 01:03:24,483
He lost a patient.

537
01:03:25,276 --> 01:03:27,987
I've never known a doctor
that cared so much.

538
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,074
Yeah.

539
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,493
(Night sounds)

540
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:42,669
Now, Dan, I'm going to need
your help with this. Understand?

541
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:48,550
This is for you, too.

542
01:03:51,803 --> 01:03:55,891
- Gloria! No...
- Dan, don't quit on me now, please.

543
01:03:55,974 --> 01:03:59,061
It's going to take the two of us
to fuse the brain to the spinal cord.

544
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:00,980
- No!
- Dan, look!

545
01:04:02,649 --> 01:04:07,028
Look what we've done.
Meg's heart is going to beat again.

546
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:11,282
Others dare not dream
what we are about to do.

547
01:04:12,867 --> 01:04:14,118
Dan...

548
01:04:19,666 --> 01:04:23,670
The feet of a young ballet dancer,

549
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:27,383
who ended her life
when she lost her ambition.

550
01:04:29,677 --> 01:04:33,639
These legs...
walked the streets.

551
01:04:34,598 --> 01:04:39,603
You remember the hooker who was
killed in ER by her pimp last week?

552
01:04:39,687 --> 01:04:42,314
Think of all the bodies
these legs have wrapped around.

553
01:04:42,439 --> 01:04:44,775
What was the value of her life?

554
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:47,904
To end up being picked apart
by the likes of Dr. Graves

555
01:04:47,988 --> 01:04:50,532
and his bumbling students?

556
01:04:50,615 --> 01:04:55,203
And here,
the womb of the virgin.

557
01:04:55,287 --> 01:04:58,790
Struck down before tasting
the pleasures of life.

558
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:02,711
Remember?

559
01:05:02,794 --> 01:05:06,715
Her skin. So soft.

560
01:05:08,091 --> 01:05:09,759
So warm.

561
01:05:11,846 --> 01:05:14,682
But so cold in death.

562
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:20,479
The arms of a waitress.

563
01:05:23,899 --> 01:05:26,110
The lawyer's hand.

564
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:29,905
Case dismissed.

565
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:37,706
And look at this delicate piece.

566
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:43,587
What do you think?
A sculptress?

567
01:05:45,213 --> 01:05:47,424
A harpist?

568
01:05:48,925 --> 01:05:51,219
Would you believe...

569
01:05:51,345 --> 01:05:53,388
a murderess?

570
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:01,856
But they're all equal now.

571
01:06:01,939 --> 01:06:06,152
Nothing but cast-off remnants
of a meaningless existence.

572
01:06:10,448 --> 01:06:11,908
Even her.

573
01:06:13,159 --> 01:06:15,870
How beautiful is this face?

574
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:19,457
Oh, yes.

575
01:06:21,042 --> 01:06:25,172
She... was special.

576
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,883
Yes.

577
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:33,722
Just... dead... tissue.

578
01:06:35,849 --> 01:06:41,355
But in our hands...
it's the clay of life.

579
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:48,613
Within this chest,
Meg's heart will beat again.

580
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,545
Good.

581
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:06,923
Let's get to work.

582
01:07:22,523 --> 01:07:24,525
Who's there?

583
01:07:53,096 --> 01:07:54,389
(Door slams)

584
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:00,354
I didn't do anything.

585
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,024
(Laughter)

586
01:08:03,149 --> 01:08:04,650
Oh, no.

587
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,488
You disappoint me,

588
01:08:08,571 --> 01:08:10,656
Dr. Graves.

589
01:08:12,116 --> 01:08:14,076
Please.

590
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:15,953
On the table!

591
01:08:18,998 --> 01:08:20,416
- No!
- Yes!

592
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:26,798
Scalpel.

593
01:08:34,139 --> 01:08:36,266
(Phone rings)

594
01:08:56,204 --> 01:08:58,164
(Hill) Left!

595
01:09:13,097 --> 01:09:14,974
Get off me!
Let me go! Get off me!

596
01:09:15,057 --> 01:09:17,601
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

597
01:09:19,895 --> 01:09:21,564
No! Let me go!

598
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,316
No!

599
01:09:25,651 --> 01:09:30,072
- Cain, West. They did this to me!
- Get the fuck off!

600
01:09:30,698 --> 01:09:32,409
And they'll pay!

601
01:09:33,451 --> 01:09:35,996
(Graves)
Please, let me out!

602
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:37,622
Let me out, please!
<i> </i>

603
01:09:37,747 --> 01:09:40,292
Please let me out! Please!

604
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,922
- (Woman) Oh, my God!
- (Man) Get security!

605
01:09:46,006 --> 01:09:48,091
(Alarm bell ringing)

606
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:56,892
(Distant thunder rumble)

607
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,500
Well...

608
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,004
If it all had been
as fresh as the head, but...

609
01:10:27,132 --> 01:10:30,177
- I think we're ready, Dan.
- Good.

610
01:10:35,057 --> 01:10:36,516
(Scratching)

611
01:10:42,064 --> 01:10:44,484
Sounds like rats in the wall.

612
01:10:45,526 --> 01:10:48,905
Rats? Yes.

613
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,533
That's what it is.

614
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:56,412
The little buggers
better stay put or I'll...

615
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,126
(Thunderclap)

616
01:11:04,003 --> 01:11:06,714
We start with the heart.

617
01:11:14,098 --> 01:11:15,933
(Thunderclap)

618
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:24,733
And God created woman.

619
01:11:31,491 --> 01:11:33,076
Let me.

620
01:12:15,828 --> 01:12:17,371
(Glass shatters)

621
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:20,417
Time?

622
01:12:21,626 --> 01:12:24,171
- Time?
- 15 seconds.

623
01:12:37,768 --> 01:12:39,644
45 seconds.

624
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:43,524
(Thunder rumble continues)

625
01:12:54,869 --> 01:12:56,913
Three minutes, 15 seconds.

626
01:12:58,122 --> 01:12:59,874
It's going to take time.

627
01:13:02,293 --> 01:13:04,253
(Door buzzer)

628
01:13:04,337 --> 01:13:05,714
Damn it!

629
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,550
Not now!

630
01:14:18,081 --> 01:14:20,083
(Distant screaming)

631
01:14:30,552 --> 01:14:33,388
(Growling and snarling)

632
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:01,459
(Laughing)

633
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:07,132
(Wings flapping)

634
01:15:24,274 --> 01:15:26,234
(Screams)

635
01:15:56,642 --> 01:15:59,269
(Roaring)

636
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:37,475
Breathe.

637
01:16:43,149 --> 01:16:44,525
Breathe.

638
01:16:50,948 --> 01:16:52,241
Yes.

639
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:56,537
Breathe, breathe...

640
01:16:58,372 --> 01:17:01,042
Breathe. Breathe.

641
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:05,380
Stay with me. Yes...

642
01:17:07,549 --> 01:17:08,925
Yes.

643
01:18:09,363 --> 01:18:11,406
You're alive.

644
01:18:26,089 --> 01:18:28,007
Alive...

645
01:18:28,174 --> 01:18:30,301
(Gasps)

646
01:18:36,683 --> 01:18:39,061
(Growling and roaring)

647
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:30,198
(Wings flapping)

648
01:20:00,395 --> 01:20:01,730
(Groaning)

649
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,817
(Cain) Herbert!

650
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,562
(West) Oh...

651
01:20:43,899 --> 01:20:45,693
I made you.

652
01:20:47,319 --> 01:20:49,196
Daniel!

653
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,990
She's alive.

654
01:20:51,115 --> 01:20:54,034
- They're coming!
- (Chapham) Now!

655
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:58,080
Dan! Get her out of here!

656
01:20:58,205 --> 01:21:01,001
Freeze! Police!

657
01:21:02,002 --> 01:21:03,211
What...?

658
01:21:05,422 --> 01:21:07,048
Francesca, go!

659
01:21:16,850 --> 01:21:19,144
Dan, help me!

660
01:21:44,128 --> 01:21:45,921
No! This!

661
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,265
Get this!

662
01:21:59,686 --> 01:22:01,063
Yes.

663
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:31,844
Who is she?

664
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:35,265
It's Meg.

665
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,143
Meg is dead.

666
01:22:44,316 --> 01:22:45,818
Dan!

667
01:22:45,943 --> 01:22:47,736
(Banging)

668
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:52,366
My God, they're using tools.

669
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,673
(Grunts)

670
01:23:14,764 --> 01:23:17,308
What have you done in here?

671
01:23:17,434 --> 01:23:19,644
We created her life.

672
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:24,525
- You made her?
- Yes. Dead pieces of this!

673
01:23:24,608 --> 01:23:27,611
With my hands,
I created what no man's mind

674
01:23:27,695 --> 01:23:31,115
or woman's womb
could ever hope to achieve.

675
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:32,783
This is blasphemy!

676
01:23:32,908 --> 01:23:36,787
Blasphemy? Before what God?

677
01:23:36,912 --> 01:23:42,626
A God repulsed by the miserable humanity
he created in his own image?

678
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:46,882
I will not be shackled
by the failures of your God.

679
01:23:46,965 --> 01:23:51,595
The only blasphemy is
to wallow in insignificance.

680
01:23:51,678 --> 01:23:56,141
I have taken refuse
of your God's failures

681
01:23:56,224 --> 01:23:58,518
and I have triumphed!

682
01:23:59,895 --> 01:24:01,313
There!

683
01:24:01,396 --> 01:24:04,566
There is my creation!

684
01:24:06,568 --> 01:24:08,945
He made me.

685
01:24:13,075 --> 01:24:14,827
(Chapham) Open up! Open!

686
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:21,250
Dan? We've got to fight them off.

687
01:24:22,043 --> 01:24:24,045
Leave him alone!

688
01:24:24,128 --> 01:24:26,047
Listen to me.

689
01:24:28,174 --> 01:24:30,009
(Screams)

690
01:24:56,955 --> 01:24:59,374
Your girlfriend doesn't
stand a chance.

691
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,502
Our girl is superior.

692
01:25:13,763 --> 01:25:15,348
Help!

693
01:25:16,474 --> 01:25:18,851
Leave her alone, you monster!

694
01:25:21,772 --> 01:25:25,234
Forget it, Dan.
She's just an assembly of dead tissue.

695
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:38,622
You... You made me.

696
01:25:39,164 --> 01:25:41,292
I made you!

697
01:25:43,377 --> 01:25:45,880
Don't! Dan, wait!

698
01:26:09,405 --> 01:26:11,532
Don't you want me?

699
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:16,621
I don't want your body.

700
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:23,294
- (Electric current sound)
- (Thunder rumbling)

701
01:26:24,795 --> 01:26:28,299
Then what do you want?

702
01:26:36,475 --> 01:26:38,477
(Bones cracking)

703
01:26:44,107 --> 01:26:46,109
(Loud heartbeat sound)

704
01:26:55,411 --> 01:26:57,872
Is this what you want?

705
01:26:58,748 --> 01:27:01,542
You're not... Meg.

706
01:27:02,627 --> 01:27:04,087
Meg's dead.

707
01:27:05,213 --> 01:27:06,923
(Howling)

708
01:27:09,258 --> 01:27:11,844
- No!
- (Door splinters)

709
01:27:20,896 --> 01:27:23,857
- Out of the way!
- You're next, you little squirt!

710
01:27:34,743 --> 01:27:36,745
(Screaming)

711
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,842
(Manic laughter)

712
01:27:51,511 --> 01:27:53,722
(Screaming)

713
01:27:55,598 --> 01:27:57,392
Make a note of it, Dan!

714
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:02,939
Tissue rejection!

715
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:12,867
My wife understands, really.

716
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:15,202
(Grunting)

717
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,210
(Bones snapping)

718
01:28:28,382 --> 01:28:29,801
Francesca!

719
01:28:32,304 --> 01:28:34,765

1
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,142
(Hill) West!

2
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,688
You bastard.

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,401
You did this to me.

4
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,949
But you'll not escape me.

5
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,452
Not this time!

6
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,331
(Laughs)

7
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,927
(Gunfire in distance)

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,180
(Helicopter overhead)

9
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,521
(Man speaking Spanish)

10
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,360
(Airstrike sounds)

11
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,322
(Patients whimpering)

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,660
- (West) Take this.
- It'll burst an artery.

13
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,496
If we don't remove this now,
he's going to go into cardiac arrest.

14
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,915
- Just be ready to clamp.
- If it doesn't hold...

15
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,626
We have no choice, Dan!

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,253
- (Patient groans)
- Now!

17
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,630
(Agonizing screams)

18
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,719
Jesus Christ! It didn't hold!

19
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,603
But his central nervous system
is still intact.

20
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:49,276
He might still prove to be useful.
More useful than he'd be otherwise.

21
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,242
(Explosions and gunfire)

22
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,881
(Patients moaning)

23
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,680
We have to retreat!
The front lines have weakened.

24
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,849
(Grunting)

25
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,024
(Gunshot)

26
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,323
(Cain) Goddamn it, Herbert!
What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,034
- You know what I'm doing, Dan.
- (Cain) Don't you ever stop?

28
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,412
(West) We may never again have access
to this volume of fresh subjects.

29
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:44,665
(Cain) Fascinating.
There's somebody...

30
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,334
- (Explosions)
- (Iguana hisses)

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,089
- Get away from those!
- What are you doing back here?

32
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,675
- Leave.
- Put that thing away!

33
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,760
This is too dangerous for all of us.

34
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,012
Where are you going?
We've got lots of work to do here.

35
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,973
Come on! Jesus Christ!

36
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:05,143
- She's right!
- She's wrong. We are close, Dan.

37
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,938
Reticular consciousness
is not just in the brain.

38
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,732
We know that, yes?
We've gone beyond that.

39
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,859
Look at this.

40
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,114
- These reptiles are the key, Dan.
- Yes.

41
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,575
You just still don't understand, do you?

42
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:24,287
This is no longer about
just reanimating the dead.

43
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,125
We will create new life.

44
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:31,044
- (Explosion)
- Hang on!

45
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,549
(Men shouting in Spanish)

46
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,175
Francesca?

47
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,512
Get out of here!

48
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,642
- Come on! Let's go!
- (Explosion)

49
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,311
- Let's go.
- My notes.

50
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,188
- Leave them!
- Wait!

51
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:52,774
- Forget it!
- We'll need this back home.

52
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,276
Come on!

53
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,701
(West) Dan?

54
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,756
(Men speaking Spanish)

55
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,687
Dan?

56
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,982
Well, you're going to be alright.

57
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,404
We've got to get out. Come on.

58
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,492
Come on. Let's go home.

59
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,749
- (Heart rate monitor beeping)
- (Door opens)

60
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,628
(Cain) Morning, Gloria.

61
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,013
- How's the star patient?
- Hello, Doctor.

62
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,684
You look great.
I see you even put on some make-up.

63
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,062
Don't tease me.
It's just that...

64
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,441
My head is about the only part of me
that's not sick.

65
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,324
- Excuse me.
- This is Dr. West.

66
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,953
He'll be coordinating with pathology
about your biopsy.

67
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,289
You're right.
That part of you is quite well.

68
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,669
I'm scared.

69
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,882
Don't worry. The surgery is routine.
I'll be taking real good care of you.

70
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,513
Come on.

71
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,409
(Pen clicking)

72
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,830
She's not an experiment.

73
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,124
- She's terminal.
- She's a patient!

74
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,627
- She could be of use to us, Dan.
- Not us! You.

75
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,756
- I'm a doctor.
- Well, be a scientist!

76
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,728
(Humming)

77
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,815
(Phone ringing in background)

78
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,408
Yes?

79
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,300
Lieutenant Leslie Chapham,
Arkham Police Department.

80
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,761
- Leslie?
- Lieutenant.

81
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,223
Well, how may I help you,
Lieutenant?

82
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,143
I understand you're in charge of the
remains from the night of the massacre?

83
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,189
Yes, but it's my understanding
that the case is closed.

84
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,733
Not to me.

85
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,124
It showed up in a carnival sideshow
just outside of Arkham.

86
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,834
Dr. Hill?

87
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,547
Remarkably well preserved, considering
the massacre was eight months ago.

88
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,801
All the specimens from that night
exhibit the same qualities.

89
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,805
Yes, as you see,
the skull is fractured right there.

90
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,599
Didn't you know it was missing?

91
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:45,603
You know, I could fix that.

92
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,565
Where do you keep
the rest of the remains?

93
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,032
The specimens from that night

94
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,870
have shown almost
no signs of deterioration.

95
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,789
This not only holds true
for the gross anatomy,

96
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:10,837
but the individual cells in each specimen
display a lack of decay.

97
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,424
Are you saying that
they're not quite dead?

98
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,968
What's dead is dead, Lieutenant.

99
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,346
I should know. It's my field.

100
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,313
What's this?

101
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,524
That's something
Dr. Hill was working on.

102
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,904
I haven't been able to identify it.
Yet.

103
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:39,282
I was planning on doing that first thing
in the morning, as a matter of fact.

104
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,868
Is this all of it?

105
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,163
- Except for fragments and debris.
- What happened to that?

106
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,249
Why, we burned them, of course.

107
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,511
(Graves) Suicide.

108
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,680
Would-be ballet dancer
didn't have the stuff,

109
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,934
- cut off her feet and bled to death.
- (Ernest giggles)

110
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,772
- Where are her feet?
- Her feet?

111
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,149
Why... they're missing.

112
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,321
A lot of stuff's been missing
from around here lately, Holmes.

113
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,658
Body parts?

114
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,496
Really, Lieutenant?
Who'd want to steal body parts?

115
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,319
Yes!

116
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,455
Hm-mm...

117
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,774
How did you get back here?

118
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:41,529
(Chuckles)

119
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,201
Well...

120
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,537
...well, well.

121
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:59,505
What do you think of the location
of the will in the brain now, Dr. Hill?

122
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,217
I'm sorry, what was that?

123
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,930
Actually, you've been
quite useful to me.

124
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:13,269
You helped me prove that consciousness
resides in every part of the body.

125
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,150
You had such pretensions of grandeur,

126
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,071
you pompous plagiarist.

127
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:30,578
But look at you now.
You're nothing but a dead-head.

128
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,794
A no-body.

129
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,797
(Chuckles)

130
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,615
- Did that police officer find you?
- Police?

131
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,119
Yes, he came by
while you were in surgery.

132
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,954
(Coughing)

133
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,376
You're gonna be alright...

134
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,963
...Gloria.

135
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,002
Herbert?

136
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,578
Herbert?

137
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
Dan!

138
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,690
(Laughs)

139
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,192
Look at this!

140
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:11,572
We practically share a wall with
the Avril's crypt in the cemetery.

141
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,494
- Ew!
- Yes, that's a 150 years of decay.

142
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,413
Oh, well.

143
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,040
Dust to dust.

144
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,508
- What happened to our cadaver?
- I was finished with it.

145
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,843
Would you help me with this,
please?

146
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,019
Security.

147
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,688
From what?

148
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,785
- Herbert, I've got something to tell you.
- Really?

149
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,246
I have something to show you.

150
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,522
- (Iguana hisses)
- Shh...

151
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,027
Look at that, Dan.

152
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,404
And no tissue damage.

153
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,951
It simulates a heart attack.
And it leaves virtually no trace.

154
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,126
(Cain) That's real useful
if you want to murder someone.

155
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,837
(West) It is very useful...

156
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,339
...in obtaining...

157
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,301
...the freshest animal specimens.

158
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,054
Right here.

159
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,143
The amniotic fluid
of the Cuzco iguana.

160
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,897
Did you know that this reptile has
not changed significantly in over...

161
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,941
...100 million years.
Herbert, I know this is important.

162
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:17,114
Now... we extract
the amniotic fluid from the sac.

163
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,369
With that,
we add the muscle proteins

164
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,996
of myosin, actin and...

165
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:27,541
- Tropomyosin.
- Good.

166
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,628
And then...

167
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,839
(Bubbling sounds)

168
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,187
Our reagent.

169
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,120
Pure potentiality.

170
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:08,666
The primordial ooze
from which life originates.

171
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:19,260
Dr. Hill...
Dr. Hill gave me this idea.

172
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,889
(West giggles)

173
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,535
I'm moving out.

174
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,787
What?

175
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,082
I'm moving out.

176
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,835
Dan...

177
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,921
You can't turn back now.

178
00:20:56,881 --> 00:21:01,260
This... This is the key
to creating life!

179
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:05,181
- Parts! Reanimated parts!
- We're saving whole people, not parts.

180
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,266
Exactly, and what are people, Dan,

181
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:10,770
over and above
a collection of living parts?

182
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,355
We can create...

183
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,358
...new life.

184
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,671
This morbid doodling
with human body parts!

185
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:44,762
Is this what it's all about?
Is this what all our great work has led to?

186
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,722
- Exactly what are you insinuating?
- This is your madness!

187
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,682
It had nothing to do with me. I'm out!

188
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:52,561
I didn't see you rejecting my work
when Meg was lying there dead!

189
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,439
- Where were your great ideals then?
- Don't you...

190
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,116
Daniel?

191
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,037
What was it about Meg that you loved?

192
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,310
Meg's heart.

193
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,038
Help me... to continue the work.

194
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,105
We can create a new life.

195
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,695
Starting...

196
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,910
...with Meg's heart.

197
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,078
(Echoing heartbeats)

198
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:37,708
Yes.

199
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,338
Now, Dan...

200
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,842
You're going to have to help.

201
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,427
At the hospital.

202
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:55,392
- What about the police?
- No, the police will never come here.

203
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,519
(Door buzzer)

204
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:28,842
- Daniel Cain?
- Yes.

205
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,892
Police?

206
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,530
Come on in.

207
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,203
Is there a problem?

208
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,212
Who are you?

209
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,634
Dr. West.

210
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,597
- Lieutenant Chapham.
- Police.

211
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:18,642
(West) What do you want?

212
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:24,398
It's... quite an old place
you got here.

213
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,442
It used to be a mortuary.

214
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,570
After the cemetery filled up,
it was the caretaker's house.

215
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,156
Nobody's been here for twenty years.

216
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,746
- Odd place to live.
- Has its advantages.

217
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,083
Huh...

218
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:48,964
- Pretty morbid stuff.
- I don't consider science morbid.

219
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,509
It was pretty morbid
the night Dr. Carl Hill died.

220
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,678
And Dean... Dean...

221
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:01,894
- Halsey.
- Dean Halsey. Yeah.

222
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,230
And Megan Halsey.

223
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,195
Do you mind if I sit down?

224
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,328
Dr. West, what kind of problems
did you have with Dr. Carl Hill?

225
00:26:19,453 --> 00:26:23,123
Dr. Hill and I had
professional differences.

226
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:26,043
It was nothing personal.
I have been all through this.

227
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:30,464
It's in the police records,
which I am certain you have access to.

228
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:34,968
(Chapham) I understand that
you have some radical ideas about...

229
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,055
the reanimation of dead tissue?

230
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:43,352
When I was in medical school, I might
have had time to discuss the theory.

231
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,937
I don't anymore.

232
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,400
I suppose those poor souls
out at the Sefton Ward... are theory.

233
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,075
I don't know
what you're talking about.

234
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,836
And I suppose you don't know anything
about the missing body parts

235
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,921
at the hospital?

236
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,591
Missing body parts?

237
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:18,679
No.

238
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,687
(Chapham) I can find my own way out.

239
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,966
(Squawking)

240
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,782
(Screaming)

241
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,619
(Wings flapping)

242
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,213
Get off! Get off!

243
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:19,925
Get off me!

244
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,958
Ernest?

245
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,128
Dr. Graves wants to see you
right away.

246
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,588
- Pathology?
- Right away.

247
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:05,012
- What about the...?
- I'll take care of it.

248
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,973
Cool.

249
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:53,393
(Hill grunts)

250
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,730
More.

251
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,274
Dr. Hill...

252
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,029
- Is that you?
- More!

253
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:22,506
Dr. Graves.

254
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,675
You... you see?

255
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:29,304
I recognize you.

256
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,681
You do?

257
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:35,894
That seminar in Zurich...

258
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,354
Yes.

259
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:44,152
Your theory of reconciling
creationism...

260
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:48,657
with the origin of disease...

261
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,534
Yes.

262
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,328
Totally idiotic!

263
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,142
It's you. Come in.

264
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,774
No, no. No lights.

265
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:26,194
Come over here.

266
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,459
Dr. Hill? Speak to me.

267
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,967
Speak to me, Dr. Hill! Speak.

268
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,639
This is some kind of joke,
right, man?

269
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:58,226
No, it is not a joke!
He can talk.

270
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,437
He heard my lecture in Zurich.

271
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,231
The head? He heard your lecture?

272
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:05,692
He can talk, for God's sake!

273
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,944
Listen.

274
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,780
Talk, damn it! Talk!

275
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,200
- Talk!
- The head...

276
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:28,089
Don't you ever do that again,
you mental midget!

277
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,801
Oh, my God.
My God, I'm losing my mind.

278
00:33:32,886 --> 00:33:37,098
I have some unfinished business.

279
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:42,687
And you will assist me.

280
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,859
(Cain) Not out the front door?

281
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:51,613
Just the doctor taking a patient out
for a little air.

282
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,290
(Dog barks)

283
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,417
- (Man) Man!
- (Woman) Oh, my God!

284
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,127
Herbert!

285
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,387
(Muttering)

286
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,184
(Dog whimpers)

287
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,313
Hey, pooch.

288
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,402
Yes! You said "Hi" to him!

289
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:31,945
Francesca!

290
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,949
Uh...

291
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,872
- Hi, Doctor.
- Hi.

292
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,835
Don't let the little head
rule the big head, Dan.

293
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,925
So, what are you doing in Arkham?

294
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,554
Oh, I'm doing some
interviews in Boston this week.

295
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:01,057
(Paging System) <i>Dr. Cam, 5436.
Dr. Cain, 5436.</i>

296
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,727
- Oh, God. I've gotta go.
- I know.

297
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,022
Listen...
What about dinner tonight?

298
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:10,525
Only if you let me cook.

299
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:15,947
- Real Italian style.
- Okay. Only if you let me help.

300
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:18,575
Real American style.

301
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,911
- It's a deal.
- See you tonight.

302
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,665
Yeah. Hope you like garlic!

303
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:35,592
Well, Angel? What do you think?

304
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,639
Hey, pooch.
Where did you come from?

305
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,433
From Peru.

306
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,645
Is that where you met Dr. Cain?

307
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,858
Why do you want to know, Mr...?

308
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,362
Oh, uh... Lee Chapham.

309
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,782
Arkham Police.

310
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,243
Lieutenant.

311
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,916
I'd like to talk to you about him.

312
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,959
(Elevator bell)

313
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,004
Did you ever hear of the "Miskatonic Massacre"?

314
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,257
- No, I haven't.
- It happened here at the hospital.

315
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,388
Eight months ago, the department
got a call about a homicide

316
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,391
at the Miskatonic University hospital.

317
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,769
The whole place was in a panic.
It was down in the morgue.

318
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:30,438
There was blood all over the walls.

319
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,899
You ever been around dead bodies?

320
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,818
(Gasps)

321
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,948
Then you know that stench
of decaying flesh.

322
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,619
Out of the darkness,
we were attacked by a naked maniac.

323
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,081
He jumped right on my partner
and bit his arm.

324
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,668
Nothing could make him come loose.
Tore the muscle right off the bone

325
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,295
before we pumped enough lead in him
to make him stop.

326
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:04,514
The dean of the medical school
was down there.

327
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,516
In pieces.

328
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,066
Also a prominent physician,
Dr. Carl Hill.

329
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,029
We found only his head.

330
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,783
The rest of his body was
just part of the muck.

331
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,455
Funny thing, though...

332
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,168
His head, when I found it,
was still...

333
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,004
...twitching.
<i> </i>

334
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,297
Twitching?

335
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,424
The doctors had a lot
of highfalutin explanations.

336
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:42,886
Post-mortem involuntary spasm...
I don't know.

337
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,891
But I've seen my share of the dead.

338
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,480
And I never saw a twitching
like that before.

339
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,942
They blamed it all
on these ones in here.

340
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,028
The funny thing is,

341
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,781
there's a death certificate
at the hospital for each one of these.

342
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,240
A death certificate?

343
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:08,411
I mean to say these three didn't get
to the morgue on their own two feet.

344
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,331
(Francesca)
The hospital made a mistake?

345
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,875
(Patients groaning)

346
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,085
(Door slams)

347
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,298
The hospital might have made
a mistake about those two.

348
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,175
(Groaning)

349
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,348
Not... But not this one.

350
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,893
I know about this one.

351
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:36,397
She was my wife.

352
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,942
I'm sorry.

353
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,111
Elizabeth, stop!

354
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,532
Get off me! Get off me!

355
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,784
(Screaming)

356
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,002
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm alright. Thanks.

357
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,258
That's enough.

358
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,760
She's never done
anything like that before.

359
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,095
Just...

360
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,139
What does all this have to do
with Daniel?

361
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:14,269
Dr. Cain and Dr. West were
the only normal survivors of that night.

362
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,605
Daniel's girlfriend was Meg Halsey,
the dean's daughter.

363
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:22,193
And Daniel was found
with her dead body in his arms.

364
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,821
Her dead body.

365
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:27,657
Twitching.

366
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,742
Like that blasted head.

367
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,454
(Chirping)

368
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,542
(Bubbling sounds)

369
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:53,057
Be careful not to use too much of that,
we don't want premature reanimation.

370
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,768
(Cain) Thank you,
I've never done this before.

371
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,616
Yes.

372
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,046
- (West) Good.
- (Gurgling sounds)

373
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,554
The circulation is going to work.

374
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,517
Goddamn it, Herbert!

375
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,148
What are we doing anyway?

376
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,068
Why don't we just publish our findings?
We could get grant money.

377
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,695
Because they would never
understand our methods.

378
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,448
Besides that,
they would steal the work.

379
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,035
It's never gonna work.

380
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,080
She's gonna be uncontrollably spastic.

381
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,958
Unless we reanimate all the limbs
at the same time, they'll separate.

382
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,336
That's why we inject
directly into the heart.

383
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:06,339
The circulatory system
should distribute the reagent

384
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,218
to all the various limbs
and effect reanimation concurrently.

385
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,262
- We've never done that before.
- I know that.

386
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:16,557
No, I don't want to gamble
with Meg's heart.

387
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,726
(Door buzzer)

388
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:38,454
Oh, God...

389
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,417
- <i>Ciao, dottore. Come va?</i>
- Francesca...

390
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,549
Sorry about the place.
I didn't have any time to...

391
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,969
- Did I come too early?
- No! No, no, no, uh...

392
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,929
God, you look great.

393
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:02,270
Open this up, will you?
It's a Chianti, 1987.

394
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:07,734
- Uh... so, where is the kitchen?
- It's right over here.

395
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:13,573
- Did you have any trouble finding it?
- Oh, no. The cemetery made it real easy.

396
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:32,633
(Francesca)
This is my special sauce.

397
00:42:32,759 --> 00:42:34,302
Here.

398
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:42,101
- What do you think? You like it?
- I love it.

399
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,021
So do I.

400
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,299
Come on.

401
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,671
You're so beautiful.

402
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,469
Your skin's so soft.

403
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,891
So warm.

404
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,925
What are you doing here?

405
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,726
What do you want?

406
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,938
The body you took
from the crematorium.

407
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,482
Get out of here. Right now.

408
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,905
What's down here?

409
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:07,533
That's none of your business.

410
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,393
You are making a big mistake.

411
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:41,817
Do you believe that dead is dead,
Dr. West?

412
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:48,074
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I am talking about my wife!

413
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:52,203
No! You can't go in there.

414
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,372
- Move.
- No.

415
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,082
Move!

416
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,757
You...

417
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,969
...butcher!

418
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,388
How dare you judge my work?

419
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:54,598
"Work"?

420
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,103
Was my wife your "work"?

421
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:02,064
- Don't lay your guilt on me, Lieutenant!
- What?

422
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,859
Your wife died
of multiple contusions to the head.

423
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,569
- From a blunt instrument.
- No.

424
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,029
- Multiple blows to the head!
- She fell!

425
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,823
She fell, did she?

426
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:14,493
That was not my fault!

427
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,253
(Heartbeat slows to a stop)

428
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,348
- What happened?
- He attacked me.

429
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:40,019
No, Dan! Dan!
I can't help it if his heart gave out!

430
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,104
God, Herbert, he's a cop!

431
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,773
You...

432
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,572
- What are we gonna do with him?
- Well...

433
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,743
We could get him
back out on the street.

434
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,245
Walking.

435
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,127
You don't wanna gamble
with Meg's heart.

436
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:09,048
This is our opportunity for a test.
Do you wanna waste it?

437
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:19,558
How much do you think he weighs?
230, 240?

438
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,024
So little tissue damage.

439
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,276
Oh, Dan?

440
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,114
Just in case.

441
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,501
Daniel?

442
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,052
It's working.

443
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,722
- (Chapham mumbles)
- (Heartbeat grows louder)

444
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:04,562
Get away from me with that cloth!

445
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,274
No! Dan!

446
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:17,324
He's a wife-beater, Dan!
Use the gun!

447
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:29,920
(Screams)

448
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,929
(Skin sizzles)

449
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,351
(Heartbeat continues)

450
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,522
(Glass clinking)

451
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,293
Dan?

452
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:10,586
Herbert!

453
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,261
(Chapham whimpers)

454
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,321
Lieutenant Chapham!
What are you doing here?

455
00:52:37,446 --> 00:52:38,947
(Snarling)

456
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,243
Herbert!

457
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,339
No! Stop!

458
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,348
Get away from me! Get out!

459
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,183
Get away!

460
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,246
(Chapham grunts)

461
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,053
- (Cain) What happened?
- (Sobs)

462
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:54,815
- Is he gone?
- What is going on here?

463
00:53:59,111 --> 00:54:01,989
What did you do to him
to make him that way?

464
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,491
She's hysterical.

465
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,871
What did you do to him? Why?

466
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,165
(Anguished screams)

467
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,322
(Hooting)

468
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,870
(Dog barking)

469
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,866
(Metal clatters)

470
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,599
What are you doing down here?

471
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:56,812
Your welcome does not extend
to this part of the house.

472
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,606
(Francesca) Angel?

473
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,235
Sweetie...

474
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,113
(Screams)

475
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,658
(Snarling and barking)

476
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:15,163
Get out of my way!

477
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,584
- You should never have brought her here.
- Get that thing out of here!

478
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:22,921
- Francesca, wait! Let me explain.
- Is this what you did to Meg?

479
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,424
You're a freak!

480
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,468
God, I hate you!

481
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,183
You're better off without her.

482
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,955
Dan, now listen to me.

483
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,793
All we need is just one last piece.

484
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,380
Dan?

485
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,677
Gloria?

486
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,430
- Hi.
- (Heart rate monitor beeping)

487
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,647
How are you feeling today?

488
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:35,953
You see... it helps me
to think of you as Meg.

489
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,958
Meg who lived.

490
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,637
(Flatline tone)

491
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,560
Nurse!

492
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,730
Paddles!

493
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,821
I didn't even notice.
God, what's wrong with me?

494
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,698
Let me through!

495
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,535
Give me that!

496
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:18,996
Clear!

497
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,540
Push the lidocaine!

498
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:24,835
Clear!

499
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,172
Forget it, Dan. Let's go in.

500
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,104
- She's never gonna survive this.
- She's already dead, Dan.

501
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:47,274
No, you're off midline.
Damn it!

502
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,035
- (West) I'm getting nothing.
- I'm sorry.

503
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,954
- Come on!
- (Suction sound)

504
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,457
- Anything?
- Still flat.

505
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:08,253
- I'm calling it.
- No!

506
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,092
Not again.

507
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,860
Go home.

508
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:37,991
Go... home.

509
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,139
Yes. Come to room 613, right away.

510
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,073
(Wheezing and grunting)

511
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,763
Damn you, West!

512
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:46,268
- Wilbur! Get me out of here!
- No.

513
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:50,730
West took my body,
but he cannot take my mind.

514
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,816
Take me to him!

515
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:59,281
No. Just don't talk.
Don't say anything.

516
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,867
(Hill snarls)

517
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,452
(Graves screams)

518
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:12,169
Don't make me get someone else.

519
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,629
(Hill wheezes)

520
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:41,281
What do you think you're doing?
Stop!

521
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:45,243
Do as I say, you nincompoop!

522
01:01:49,915 --> 01:01:51,666
Come on, come on.

523
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,296
You're going away now.

524
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,680
Now, now...

525
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,188
(Door opens)

526
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:17,817
- Yo, Dr. West.
- Let's get this.

527
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:25,408
No, no. You get the feet.
I'll get the head.

528
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,961
Was she good-looking, Doc?

529
01:02:53,353 --> 01:02:55,438
You take this to the crematorium.

530
01:02:55,522 --> 01:02:58,024
The crematorium?
You mean pathology.

531
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,110
I mean the crematorium.

532
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,701
Well, excuse me!

533
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,956
Excuse me,
have you seen Dr. Cain?

534
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,751
He left.
For the day, I think.

535
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:20,672
- Is there something wrong?
- He's very upset.

536
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,590
He lost a patient.

537
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:26,094
I've never known a doctor
that cared so much.

538
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,181
Yeah.

539
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,600
(Night sounds)

540
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:40,775
Now, Dan, I'm going to need
your help with this. Understand?

541
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:46,656
This is for you, too.

542
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:53,997
- Gloria! No...
- Dan, don't quit on me now, please.

543
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,167
It's going to take the two of us
to fuse the brain to the spinal cord.

544
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,085
- No!
- Dan, look!

545
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:05,133
Look what we've done.
Meg's heart is going to beat again.

546
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:09,387
Others dare not dream
what we are about to do.

547
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,223
Dan...

548
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,775
The feet of a young ballet dancer,

549
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,487
who ended her life
when she lost her ambition.

550
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,743
These legs...
walked the streets.

551
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:37,707
You remember the hooker who was
killed in ER by her pimp last week?

552
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,418
Think of all the bodies
these legs have wrapped around.

553
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,879
What was the value of her life?

554
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,007
To end up being picked apart
by the likes of Dr. Graves

555
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:48,635
and his bumbling students?

556
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:53,306
And here,
the womb of the virgin.

557
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,893
Struck down before tasting
the pleasures of life.

558
01:04:58,645 --> 01:05:00,814
Remember?

559
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:04,818
Her skin. So soft.

560
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,862
So warm.

561
01:05:09,948 --> 01:05:12,784
But so cold in death.

562
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,581
The arms of a waitress.

563
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,212
The lawyer's hand.

564
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,007
Case dismissed.

565
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,807
And look at this delicate piece.

566
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:41,688
What do you think?
A sculptress?

567
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:45,525
A harpist?

568
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:49,320
Would you believe...

569
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,489
a murderess?

570
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:59,956
But they're all equal now.

571
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,252
Nothing but cast-off remnants
of a meaningless existence.

572
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,008
Even her.

573
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,970
How beautiful is this face?

574
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,557
Oh, yes.

575
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:23,271
She... was special.

576
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:25,982
Yes.

577
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:31,821
Just... dead... tissue.

578
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:39,454
But in our hands...
it's the clay of life.

579
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:46,711
Within this chest,
Meg's heart will beat again.

580
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:01,643
Good.

581
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,021
Let's get to work.

582
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,622
Who's there?

583
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,485
(Door slams)

584
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:58,449
I didn't do anything.

585
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,119
(Laughter)

586
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,745
Oh, no.

587
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:06,583
You disappoint me,

588
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,751
Dr. Graves.

589
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,171
Please.

590
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:14,048
On the table!

591
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,511
- No!
- Yes!

592
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,892
Scalpel.

593
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,360
(Phone rings)

594
01:08:54,297 --> 01:08:56,257
(Hill) Left!

595
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:13,066
Get off me!
Let me go! Get off me!

596
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,693
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

597
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,656
No! Let me go!

598
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,408
No!

599
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:28,164
- Cain, West. They did this to me!
- Get the fuck off!

600
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,500
And they'll pay!

601
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:34,087
(Graves)
Please, let me out!

602
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:35,713
Let me out, please!
<i> </i>

603
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,383
Please let me out! Please!

604
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:44,013
- (Woman) Oh, my God!
- (Man) Get security!

605
01:09:44,097 --> 01:09:46,182
(Alarm bell ringing)

606
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:54,982
(Distant thunder rumble)

607
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:18,589
Well...

608
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,093
If it all had been
as fresh as the head, but...

609
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,266
- I think we're ready, Dan.
- Good.

610
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,605
(Scratching)

611
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:42,572
Sounds like rats in the wall.

612
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,993
Rats? Yes.

613
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,621
That's what it is.

614
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:54,500
The little buggers
better stay put or I'll...

615
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,214
(Thunderclap)

616
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,802
We start with the heart.

617
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:14,020
(Thunderclap)

618
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:22,820
And God created woman.

619
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,162
Let me.

620
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:15,456
(Glass shatters)

621
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,501
Time?

622
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:22,255
- Time?
- 15 seconds.

623
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,728
45 seconds.

624
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:41,607
(Thunder rumble continues)

625
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,996
Three minutes, 15 seconds.

626
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:57,957
It's going to take time.

627
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,336
(Door buzzer)

628
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:03,796
Damn it!

629
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:06,632
Not now!

630
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,162
(Distant screaming)

631
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,467
(Growling and snarling)

632
01:14:57,868 --> 01:14:59,537
(Laughing)

633
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,209
(Wings flapping)

634
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,311
(Screams)

635
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,344
(Roaring)

636
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:35,549
Breathe.

637
01:16:41,222 --> 01:16:42,598
Breathe.

638
01:16:49,021 --> 01:16:50,314
Yes.

639
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:54,610
Breathe, breathe...

640
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,115
Breathe. Breathe.

641
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:03,452
Stay with me. Yes...

642
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,997
Yes.

643
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,476
You're alive.

644
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,076
Alive...

645
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:28,370
(Gasps)

646
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:37,129
(Growling and roaring)

647
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,264
(Wings flapping)

648
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,795
(Groaning)

649
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,882
(Cain) Herbert!

650
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,625
(West) Oh...

651
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,756
I made you.

652
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:47,259
Daniel!

653
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:49,053
She's alive.

654
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:52,097
- They're coming!
- (Chapham) Now!

655
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,143
Dan! Get her out of here!

656
01:20:56,268 --> 01:20:59,063
Freeze! Police!

657
01:21:00,064 --> 01:21:01,273
What...?

658
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:05,110
Francesca, go!

659
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:17,206
Dan, help me!

660
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,982
No! This!

661
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,325
Get this!

662
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,123
Yes.

663
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:29,903
Who is she?

664
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:33,323
It's Meg.

665
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,201
Meg is dead.

666
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,876
Dan!

667
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,794
(Banging)

668
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:50,424
My God, they're using tools.

669
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:04,730
(Grunts)

670
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:15,365
What have you done in here?

671
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:17,701
We created her life.

672
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:22,581
- You made her?
- Yes. Dead pieces of this!

673
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,667
With my hands,
I created what no man's mind

674
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:29,171
or woman's womb
could ever hope to achieve.

675
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,839
This is blasphemy!

676
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:34,843
Blasphemy? Before what God?

677
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:40,682
A God repulsed by the miserable humanity
he created in his own image?

678
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:44,937
I will not be shackled
by the failures of your God.

679
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:49,650
The only blasphemy is
to wallow in insignificance.

680
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:54,196
I have taken refuse
of your God's failures

681
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:56,573
and I have triumphed!

682
01:23:57,950 --> 01:23:59,368
There!

683
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,621
There is my creation!

684
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:07,000
He made me.

685
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:12,881
(Chapham) Open up! Open!

686
01:24:15,133 --> 01:24:19,304
Dan? We've got to fight them off.

687
01:24:20,097 --> 01:24:22,099
Leave him alone!

688
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,101
Listen to me.

689
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:28,063
(Screams)

690
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:57,426
Your girlfriend doesn't
stand a chance.

691
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,554
Our girl is superior.

692
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,400
Help!

693
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:16,903
Leave her alone, you monster!

694
01:25:19,823 --> 01:25:23,285
Forget it, Dan.
She's just an assembly of dead tissue.

695
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,673
You... You made me.

696
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:39,343
I made you!

697
01:25:41,428 --> 01:25:43,930
Don't! Dan, wait!

698
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,581
Don't you want me?

699
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,670
I don't want your body.

700
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:21,343
- (Electric current sound)
- (Thunder rumbling)

701
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:26,348
Then what do you want?

702
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:36,525
(Bones cracking)

703
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,157
(Loud heartbeat sound)

704
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:55,919
Is this what you want?

705
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,589
You're not... Meg.

706
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,134
Meg's dead.

707
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,970
(Howling)

708
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:09,891
- No!
- (Door splinters)

709
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:21,903
- Out of the way!
- You're next, you little squirt!

710
01:27:32,789 --> 01:27:34,791
(Screaming)

711
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,887
(Manic laughter)

712
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:51,767
(Screaming)

713
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:55,437
Make a note of it, Dan!

714
01:27:58,815 --> 01:28:00,984
Tissue rejection!

715
01:28:08,533 --> 01:28:10,911
My wife understands, really.

716
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:13,246
(Grunting)

717
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:21,254
(Bones snapping)

718
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:27,844
Francesca!

719
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,808

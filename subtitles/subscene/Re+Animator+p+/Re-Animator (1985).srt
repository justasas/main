1
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,825
Dr. Gruber!

2
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,165
<i>Doctor!</i>

3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,416
<i>Mr. West!</i>

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,629
<i>Mr. West!</i>

5
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>Get out!</i>

6
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,053
<i>Move back.</i>

7
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,903
My god.

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,326
You idiots!
You'll ruin my notes.

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,828
I have to record
his vital signs!

10
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,205
No! No!

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,625
Dr. Gruber?

12
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,336
<i>Dr. Gruber, How this happened?</i>

13
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,675
Dr. Gruber?

14
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>He's dead.</i>

15
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,364
Of course, he's dead,
the dosage was too large.

16
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,323
You killed him.

17
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,826
No, I did not.

18
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,621
I gave him life.

19
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,336
All right,
I'm gonna zap her again.

20
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,172
Charge up the paddles.

21
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,215
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

22
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,134
Sorry, doctor.

23
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,178
Hold the compressions.

24
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,139
Clear!

25
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,978
Straight line.

26
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,858
All right, let's call it.

27
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,775
Cain.

28
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,987
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

29
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,697
Cain, we have done everything

30
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,741
that can be done for this woman.

31
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,701
She has not responded.

32
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,913
She's gone!

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,635
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

34
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,888
A good doctor
knows when to stop.

35
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,889
- Dr. Harrod, just..
- Take her.

36
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,100
And take her to the morgue.

37
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,938
Gangway..

38
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,533
Mr. Cain.

39
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,868
Hey, Mace!

40
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,203
I got another one for you.

41
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,289
They ain't locked.
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

42
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,541
Oh, thanks.

43
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,752
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here.

44
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,254
Nobody wants in..

45
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,006
and ain't nobody gettin' out.

46
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,884
Yup.

47
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,124
Full house.

48
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,181
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't mean to scare you.

49
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,348
Oh, it wasn't too bad
Dean Halsey.

50
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,100
I just didn't know anybody was here.

51
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,144
You mean, "anybody else".

52
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,645
Dan, this is Herbert West.

53
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,355
He'll be joining you
in your third year.

54
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,316
He was doing independent
research in Switzerland

55
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,193
with Dr. Gruber shortly before he died.

56
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,653
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain.

57
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,071
(One of Miskatonic Medical's

58
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,366
best young hopes
for the future of medicine.

59
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,784
What were you researching?

60
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,244
Death.

61
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,331
Alan, we don't see you
around here much anymore.

62
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, I was just showing
our newest student,

63
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
Herbert West here,
the not-so-grand tour.

64
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,295
This should interest you, Carl.

65
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,965
He worked with Hans Gruber.

66
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,675
Mr. West?

67
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,431
This is our eminent brain researcher
and grant machine, Dr. Carl Hill.

68
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,517
I know your work, Dr. Hill.

69
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,352
Quite well.

70
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is..

71
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,190
interesting..

72
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,735
though derivative of Dr. Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

73
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,113
So derivative, in fact, that in Europe
it's considered plagiarized.

74
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:54,076
And your support of the 12-minute limit on
the life of the brain stem after death..

75
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,079
Six to 12 minutes, Mr..

76
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,998
West. Herbert West.

77
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,168
Frankly, Dr. Hill?

78
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,587
Your work on brain death
is outdated.

79
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,801
Carl, while I remember,

80
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,387
we're having a grant committee
meeting Thursday.

81
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,014
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

82
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,307
Well, I'd love to, Alan,

83
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,393
looking forward to it.

84
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,146
And looking forward to
seeing you in class, Mr. West.

85
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,791
Hi.

86
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,379
No. No.

87
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,594
Yes! Oh, yes!

88
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:12,029
Rufus!

89
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,239
Thanks a lot, buddy.

90
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:16,325
I have to go.

91
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,204
No, stay.

92
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,789
Daddy knows I'm here.

93
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,625
I don't care
what Dean Halsey knows.

94
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,793
Be reasonable.

95
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,046
If I didn't come home
one night..

96
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,797
just one night..

97
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,799
What would he do?

98
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,551
Expel me?

99
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,803
He's out of touch with the times.

100
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,555
That's just the way he is,

101
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,099
the world's last living Puritan.

102
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,146
I really hate it.

103
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,445
The day that you graduate,

104
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:57,115
the minute you get your M.D.,
I'll marry you,

105
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,827
and I'll help you, and I'll be with you

106
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,580
as much as I can until then.

107
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,958
I promise.

108
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,294
Back to square one.

109
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,881
Well, at least it gives me
a chance to housebreak you.

110
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,802
Housebroken, is it?

111
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:25,977
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, my girl.

112
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,021
What are you doing?

113
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:31,858
Dan.

114
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,986
Dan.. stop, don't.

115
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,614
Dan, stop it!

116
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,865
Come, my pretty.

117
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:41,618
Dan, I don't like that.

118
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:45,872
There's not a jury in the world
that would convict me.

119
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,624
Dan, stop it!

120
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,626
Doctor Dan!

121
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,879
Dan, don't, come on, stop.

122
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,047
I really have to go.

123
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,590
Come here! Come to me.

124
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,718
- Oh.
- What?

125
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,805
Oh, shit.

126
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:03,056
Hi.

127
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,559
Can I help you?

128
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,144
You're
here about the apartment.

129
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,604
Yes.

130
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,815
Didn't we meet this morning?
You're..

131
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,775
West. Herbert West.

132
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,361
Excuse me just one sec.

133
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,574
Come in.

134
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,868
Thank you.

135
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,541
I startled you.

136
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,752
Yes, you did.

137
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:37,215
May I introduce my fiancÃ©e,
Megan Halsey?

138
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:40,469
- Miss Halsey.
- Mr. West.

139
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,763
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr. West.

140
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,140
Oh.. Herbert.

141
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,695
So, you've
just come from Europe?

142
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,198
Switzerland.

143
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,617
What was Dr. Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

144
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,243
Yes, pretty famous..

145
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,871
Does this building
have a basement?

146
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,377
Oh, yes.

147
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,300
Yes.

148
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,178
I think this will be just fine.

149
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,597
I have my things outside,
shall I move in now?

150
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,725
Look, I have to go.

151
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,936
I think you and Mr. West
have a lot to discuss

152
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,354
before you decide anything.

153
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,440
Oh, I've decided.

154
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:36,733
Well, I'd like-â€”

155
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,819
You know, you'll never even
know that I'm here.

156
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,736
Dan, I..

157
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,987
Except, of course,
on the first of the month.

158
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,614
Mr. West?

159
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,990
Miss Halsey?

160
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,994
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

161
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,082
There was no more
I could learn there.

162
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,921
Do we.. have a deal?

163
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,011
Done.

164
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,765
Done.

165
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:13,061
You make the incision
at the base of the skull..

166
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,536
cutting away
enough of the faschia..

167
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,457
to get your fingers in..

168
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,715
and then grasping firmly
with both hands,

169
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:46,887
you pull the skin forward
over the head,

170
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,974
very much like peeling
a large orange.

171
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:58,440
Once the skull is plainly visible,

172
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,651
you take the bone saw..

173
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,905
And you cut around the perimeter.

174
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,421
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

175
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,798
the human brain.

176
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:26,593
Once the brain stem
of an individual,

177
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:29,679
I'm talking about the reticular
activating system,

178
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,307
heart regulation,
respiratory center.

179
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:34,851
Once these activities cease,

180
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:40,231
the brain can only survive
an additional six to 12 minutes.

181
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,193
Six to 12 minutes.

182
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,239
Until..

183
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:52,869
brain death brings about
an irreversible conclusion.

184
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,548
We all want to retain
our personalities

185
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,801
in some idyllic afterlife.

186
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,720
We all pray for some miracle,

187
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,432
some drug, potion, pill.

188
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,151
Perhaps, though,
it takes something else.

189
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,698
Perhaps it takes desire,
an obsessive desire.

190
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,200
Perhaps it ta..

191
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,876
We will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure

192
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,296
at another time.

193
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,465
Mr. West!

194
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,885
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

195
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,139
Class dismissed.

196
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,226
How can you teach such drivel?

197
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,270
These people are here to learn
and you're closing their minds

198
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,521
before they even have a chance!

199
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,023
What are you here for,
Mr. West?

200
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,025
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas,

201
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,443
then at least you'd have ideas!

202
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,528
Mr. West!

203
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:14,159
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

204
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:25,378
I would like to propose a toast

205
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,589
to the National Science Foundation

206
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,926
for recognizing the genius
of Dr. Carl Hill,

207
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,056
and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

208
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,682
its largest grant ever.

209
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:43,229
Your new laser drill is going
to revolutionize neurosurgery.

210
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:47,942
To the foundation,
and to Miskatonic.

211
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,864
It's all right, sweetheart,
you can drink up.

212
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:53,990
We're celebrating.

213
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:56,159
I know, Daddy,
but I have to go soon.

214
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,954
After preparing such a feast,
you must be tired.

215
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,706
I have a study date.

216
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,166
With Daniel?

217
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,834
Yeah.

218
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,169
Daniel Cain'?

219
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,632
Herbert West has moved in
with him, hasn't he?

220
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,383
For the time being.

221
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,345
That must be him Excuse me.

222
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,435
So, your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

223
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,273
You think that's wise, Alan'?

224
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,483
Dan!

225
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,235
Hello, sir.

226
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,945
Dr. Hill.

227
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,988
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

228
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,742
Actually, we have some
work to do.

229
00:18:37,826 --> 00:18:39,285
Why don't you study here?

230
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:42,789
Well, I've her home soon,
don't worry.

231
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:47,127
Well then, one last toast?

232
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,547
To Megan..

233
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,676
my esteemed colleague's capable,

234
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,263
beautiful, loving daughter,

235
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,474
the obsession of all
who fall under her spell.

236
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,325
Dan.

237
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,870
No.

238
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:24,664
Please!

239
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,832
Okay, what is it?

240
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,792
I don't know, it's..

241
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,045
Look, it's not you, really.

242
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,298
It's just a lot of little things.

243
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,049
Like what?

244
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,719
Well, West is always in his room
with the door closed.

245
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,762
I mean, do you ever see him?

246
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,347
Does he ever eat?

247
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,975
I told you, he's a little cracked.

248
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,646
He bothers you, too.

249
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,857
No, don't be ridiculous.

250
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,525
Rufus is terrified of him.

251
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,068
When West comes in,
he runs and hides.

252
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,987
Rufus hides
and runs all the time,

253
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,363
it's standard cat activity.

254
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,448
Yes, but not when we're together,

255
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,491
then he's all over us trying
to get your attention and..

256
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,578
Where is he?

257
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,079
I haven't seen him
since we got here.

258
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,372
It's okay, he's around here.

259
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,457
I haven't even heard him,

260
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,210
usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

261
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,756
Pss pss pss pss.

262
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:19,260
Rufus.. Rufus.. Rufus.

263
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,470
Pss pss pss pss.

264
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,057
Come on, you fat cat.

265
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,600
Here, kitty!

266
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,393
Rufus.

267
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:29,812
Come on now, you mad animal.

268
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,856
Don't you try to hide from me.

269
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,400
I know all of your tricks.

270
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,403
Rufus? Where are you, boy?

271
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,405
Here, kitty.

272
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,532
Here, kitty!

273
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,577
Here, kitty.

274
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,503
Rufus. Hey, boy!

275
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,725
Rufus?

276
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,023
Rufus?

277
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:17,819
Rufus.

278
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,494
Rufus?

279
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,420
Hey, boy.

280
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,637
Rufus, are you in here?

281
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:52,520
Here, boy.

282
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,564
Here, kitty.

283
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,538
Rufus?

284
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,129
Oh, Dan, I think it's..

285
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,839
What are you doing in my room?

286
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,341
- How dare you come in..
- Dan!

287
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,261
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

288
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,889
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

289
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,140
Meg, what the hell
are you doing in here?

290
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,100
- I..
- Would you please leave, now!

291
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,353
Easy!

292
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:34,645
In the fridge.

293
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,699
I was going to show you.

294
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,785
Shut up.

295
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,541
What happened?

296
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,669
It was dead when I found it.

297
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,755
You killed him.

298
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,548
He hated you!

299
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:05,426
Meg. It suffocated.

300
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:12,558
It knocked the garbage over and
it got its head stuck in a jar.

301
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,560
You weren't home,
so I put it in there.

302
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,270
I certainly didn't think
you'd want to find it like that.

303
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,189
I didn't want
to stink the place up.

304
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,233
I was going to show you.

305
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:21,901
You couldn't call, or write a note?

306
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,028
I was busy pushing bodies around,
as you well know,

307
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,405
and what would a note say, Dan?

308
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,907
"Cat dead, details later"?

309
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,033
I knew you were fond of it.

310
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:30,284
You killed him, I know you did.

311
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,285
He killed him.

312
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,912
Besides, I do not
like people in my room!

313
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,665
All right, that's enough.

314
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,257
I think you both better leave, now.

315
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,341
What the hell is this?

316
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,551
That is none of your business.

317
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:47,677
Yeah, I think it is my business!

318
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,803
Just as it is none of my business

319
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,513
that you're sleeping
with Dean Halsey's daughter.

320
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,601
You know, I would not want
to see a fellow student,

321
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:57,437
especially one
as promising as yourself,

322
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,814
be thrown out of school,
out of the profession..

323
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,443
on moral ground.

324
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,570
I think Dr. Halsey
just might understand.

325
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,321
Oh, do you?

326
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:09,866
Well, you may well be right.

327
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,703
Are you sure you want
to find out?

328
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,333
Herbert?

329
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:02,502
Herbert.

330
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,420
Herbert!

331
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,006
You hear that sound?

332
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,717
West! West!

333
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,346
West, what is that?

334
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,245
Quiet!

335
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,291
Get off of..

336
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,210
Cain!

337
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:48,381
Get out of here!

338
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:54,720
Get it off of me!

339
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,604
Stay away!

340
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:04,689
Later!

341
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,779
AW, shit.

342
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,824
There he is! Shit.

343
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,584
Don't move.

344
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,755
Look out!

345
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,341
There it goes under the stairs,
it's under the stairs.

346
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,811
Okay, I got it.

347
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,938
I got it.

348
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,008
Oh.

349
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,551
Look out!

350
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,900
It's really quite simple.

351
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,819
All life is a physical
and chemical process, correct?

352
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:37,865
It stands to reason then, that if one
could find extremely fresh specimens

353
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,369
and recharge that chemical process,
bang, we have re-animation.

354
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:46,040
- The theory is not new, West.
- But my reagent is.

355
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,708
Read.

356
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,590
"With various animating solutions,"

357
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:56,384
"I have killed and brought
to animated life,"

358
00:27:56,467 --> 00:28:00,304
"a number of rabbits,
guinea pigs, cats, and dogs."

359
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:02,556
I've broken the 6 to 12 minute barrier.

360
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:04,517
I've conquered brain death.

361
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,979
"With the higher animals
and the consequent"

362
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:13,859
increased strength of solution,
reaction has become more violent..

363
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:17,029
and my research
has become more difficult.

364
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:20,449
Which is why
I need you to help me.

365
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,534
Help you?

366
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,869
You are the perfect person
to assist me.

367
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,872
You're hard-working, bright,
people respect you,

368
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:31,544
and you have access
to certain authorities.

369
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,172
We can defeat death.

370
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,842
We can achieve
every doctor's dream.

371
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:41,470
You'll be famous.. and live lifetimes.

372
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:44,932
You haven't done this on people?

373
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:51,605
I've done all I can here.

374
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,942
I'll need new lab space.

375
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,944
You will help me.

376
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,655
- No!
- Why? Because it's mad?

377
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,365
No, because I don't
believe you.

378
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:03,367
How can you say that?
You've seen the results.

379
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:05,661
No, Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

380
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:07,413
You drugged him
and reduced his vital signs.

381
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:08,622
You lowered his body temperature.

382
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:09,832
He couldn't have been dead.

383
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,500
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

384
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,754
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

385
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,513
West, no!

386
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,227
West, stop!

387
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,354
I'll show you.

388
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,148
- Then you'll help me.
- No!

389
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:35,357
Yes, you will.

390
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,028
That is why I brought the infernal beast
back to life in the first place.

391
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,660
- In the brain?
- Of course.

392
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:54,710
Don't expect it to tango,
it has a broken back.

393
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,969
God! Why does
it make that noise?

394
00:30:04,053 --> 00:30:06,639
Birth is always painful.

395
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,937
It was dead.

396
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,396
Twice.

397
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:19,985
- Oh, it's him!
- Baby, what are you doing here?

398
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:21,821
It's Rufus! HOW did..

399
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:24,657
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Oh! Oh, my god.

400
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:36,752
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue.

401
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:43,008
Mr. Cain, I'm surprised.

402
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,093
No, I've seen it.

403
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:48,097
He brought back a dead animal,
a cat, back to life.

404
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,183
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr. Cain,

405
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:54,144
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr. West.

406
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,773
I know he's unstable,
but I've seen the results,

407
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,025
and so has your daughter.

408
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:02,194
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

409
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,613
She walked into an experiment.

410
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:07,783
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?

411
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,785
I never intended to involve her.

412
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,746
Tomorrow morning, you will
submit to me a written apology

413
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,540
for this entire affair.

414
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,002
These experiments were clearly beyond
the scope of your legitimate studies.

415
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,422
They've obviously interfered with
your ability to do your class work.

416
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:26,051
If any equipment from the hospital
or from the laboratories

417
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,638
of Miskatonic University were involved
in any of this unauthorized activity,

418
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:31,599
criminal charges
may be pressed.

419
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:35,311
You will, in any case, have
your student loan rescinded.

420
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,399
My loan?

421
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,776
I won't be able to continue school.

422
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,321
As for Mr. West,
he needs submit no apology.

423
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,782
You may tell him that he may
continue with his research

424
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,076
without the impediment
of an education.

425
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,954
As of now, he is no longer
a student of this university.

426
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:57,082
Sir, can we please just discuss this?

427
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,418
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

428
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:03,047
That will be all, Mr. Cain.

429
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,557
Don't take this out on Meg.

430
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,101
She tried to stop me.

431
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:19,188
I said that will be all.

432
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:37,373
- Oh, they keep on a comin', don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

433
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,677
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have you?

434
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,012
Yeah, one meatball
run over by a semi.

435
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,472
Ew!

436
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,849
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

437
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:58,477
I might go catch me
some coffee.

438
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,062
- Take your time.
- You got it.

439
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,031
Meatball?

440
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,992
Just put your shoes on.

441
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,339
Oh, damn, if we get caught..

442
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:29,341
Oh, well, what will they do?

443
00:33:29,425 --> 00:33:31,176
Embalm us?

444
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,762
Let's go.

445
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,575
Burn victim.

446
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,165
- Here's your meatball.
- Oh.

447
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,047
Shotgun wound to the head.

448
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,217
Oh, god, he's rotten.

449
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,056
- Malpractice.
- Shit.

450
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:20,059
Let's go, we're not going
to find anything.

451
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:21,852
Wait. Wait!

452
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,526
Yes, I think you.

453
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,361
How long?

454
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,781
He arrived early this evening.

455
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:36,200
John Doe, apparently just dropped dead.

456
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,078
No record of any damage.
It's almost perfect.

457
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,789
Why "almost"?

458
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,874
Could be heart damage.

459
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:44,958
Then let's just find another one.

460
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:47,086
No! We do not have time!

461
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,004
All we need tonight

462
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:51,507
is a specific, conscious reaction.

463
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,175
He's been dead for hours.

464
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:56,553
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness will justify proceeding.

465
00:34:59,181 --> 00:35:01,183
Start the recorder.

466
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,269
Start the damn recorder!

467
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:09,525
Make the entry.

468
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,278
October..

469
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,279
Tenth.

470
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,405
Tenth.

471
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,950
- Subject: Male.
- Age?

472
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:22,204
Age, early twenties.

473
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,290
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

474
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:29,002
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

475
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,133
Apparent cause of death..

476
00:35:36,844 --> 00:35:38,846
what?

477
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,973
Heart failure.

478
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,517
Heart failure.

479
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:48,939
Time, 10:33 PM.

480
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,859
10:33 PM.

481
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,488
15 cc's.

482
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,993
15 cc's of reagent being administered.

483
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:11,295
He loves me,
we're getting married.

484
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:14,256
He's mad! I've seen this happen
to medical students before.

485
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,757
Good ones!

486
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,094
Dr. Harrod, is Mr. Cain loose
in this hospital?

487
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:21,096
In the morgue, I think, doctor.

488
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,099
I specifically told
Dr. Riley to suspend him,

489
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:27,102
and to take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

490
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:30,606
Dr. Riley's been
in emergency surgery for four hours.

491
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,984
I haven't seen him.

492
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,360
Time elapsed.

493
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:41,074
15 seconds.

494
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,121
Something should
have happened by now.

495
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,302
It's not working.

496
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,386
Let's get out of here!

497
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,640
Obviously, the human dosage
factor is unknown.

498
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,351
Increasing the dosage,
20 cc's of reagent.

499
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,269
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

500
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,421
Damn!

501
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:39,508
Page Mr. Cain and have him report
to Level L security desk,

502
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:42,719
and make sure
that she stays right here.

503
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,264
You can't stop me! I followed you here,
and I'm gonna follow you

504
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:46,431
- until you listen to me!
- Megan!

505
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:47,516
- I love him!
- You're my daughter,

506
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,434
and you'll do as you're told!

507
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,436
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

508
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,981
Mr. Cain will be up soon,
you can discuss it then.

509
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:55,899
Don't blame him, Daddy!

510
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,986
We failed.

511
00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:00,279
Come on, let's go!

512
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,863
I mean, someone
could be coming any minute!

513
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:05,367
He failed! Not I!

514
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,661
<i>Mr. Cain, Mr. Daniel Cain,</i>

515
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,831
<i>please report
to the security desk, Level L</i>

516
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,125
Oh, god.

517
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,876
Cover him up.

518
00:38:16,003 --> 00:38:18,422
- Let's go!
- All right!

519
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,568
Grab him!

520
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,781
Stop!

521
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,078
It listened to me.

522
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,547
Cain?

523
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:04,384
Cain?

524
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,555
Cain, open up this door.

525
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,642
Help!

526
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:14,061
Get help!

527
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,980
Is West in there with you?

528
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:18,231
You're in a lot of trouble,
both of you!

529
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,465
No!

530
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,641
Let go!

531
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:07,406
Stop!

532
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:08,657
For god's sakes!

533
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:12,744
Dan.. look out.

534
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,610
Come on.

535
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,696
Find the recorder.

536
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,242
- Herbert.. no.
- Did you see him react?

537
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:54,911
He listened to me.
It made a conscious act.

538
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:57,914
He heard you as an animal would.

539
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,001
Herbert, no, you can't be serious!

540
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:02,544
Hell, you may be right.

541
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:03,753
It'd probably been dead too long.

542
00:41:03,837 --> 00:41:06,465
It wasn't fresh enough!

543
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,468
We probably only revived the senses
and the instincts, so, come on!

544
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,636
Help me get him up.

545
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,804
Is he dead?

546
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:15,223
Of course, will you
give me a hand here?

547
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,767
Now, he interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

548
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,186
Granted, it was an accident.

549
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,646
But this is the freshest body
that we could come across

550
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,898
save of killing one ourselves,

551
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,317
and every moment that we spend
talking about it costs us results!

552
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,402
Now will you give me a hand?

553
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:33,074
Dan, we can bring him back to life.

554
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:48,298
Okay.

555
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:58,266
Now, get the recorder.

556
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,228
Find my serum.

557
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,816
This is a dream.

558
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,985
Fiction.

559
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,780
Here. Do his other hand.

560
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,451
Oh, good.

561
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:22,332
Unbreakable plastic, one of
man's few durable inventions.

562
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,419
Certainly more durable than this.

563
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:31,341
We need you in the crash room.

564
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,301
Coming.

565
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:04,165
12 cc's being administered.

566
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:08,837
The dosage lessened in accordance
to the freshness of the subject.

567
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:28,315
5 seconds.

568
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:30,650
Come on.

569
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:34,446
I'll show you.

570
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,617
15 seconds. I'll show you!

571
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,160
17 seconds.

572
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:42,662
Re-animation at 17 seconds!
The eyes opened!

573
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,956
Doctor. Dr. Halsey,

574
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,627
you once did me a favor by
letting me into your medical school.

575
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,794
Doctor?

576
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:51,630
Welcome back to life.

577
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,821
Daddy?

578
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,531
Dan?

579
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,075
Damn the bitch.

580
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,828
Megan.. Meg?

581
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:30,377
Dan, what is it,
are you all right?

582
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:38,927
Dan, he's trying to speak,
the recorder!

583
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,056
No!

584
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:44,933
Daddy!

585
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,101
Daddy, no!

586
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,894
No! No, Meg, don't go near him!

587
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:48,895
What the hell happened here?

588
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,855
Dan, you all right?

589
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:52,732
Who's that?

590
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:58,571
That is Dean Halsey, sir.

591
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,700
You see I came down here
to visit Mr. Cain,

592
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:04,703
who was here working
and Halsey entered

593
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,706
and started ranting at us,
rather irrationally.

594
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,207
No!

595
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,751
He was just angry!

596
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:12,794
Daddy!

597
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,837
Meg. What happened?

598
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,004
Who's that over there?

599
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,881
Just a corpse.

600
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:20,385
You see, Halsey came in,
grabbed that thing,

601
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,763
and, well, went crazy.

602
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:25,265
Dean Halsey?

603
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:26,307
Dean Halsey!

604
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,308
Arrest them!

605
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:29,185
I'm calling the police!

606
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:30,979
Oh, Daddy!

607
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:47,579
Shock.. don't worry.

608
00:46:13,229 --> 00:46:16,691
Daddy.

609
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,235
He can't hear you, or see you.

610
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:23,948
That's a one-way mirror.

611
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:28,036
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

612
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,204
Will he ever be..

613
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,956
Until we know exactly what
happened to him,

614
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,796
there's no way to determine
his course of recovery.

615
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,590
That's why I need you
to sign a release,

616
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:44,803
so that I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

617
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:47,806
Is that absolutely necessary,
Dr. Hill?

618
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:52,519
I know how difficult
this must be for you,

619
00:46:52,602 --> 00:46:57,816
but I'm convinced that your father's
problem is neurological.

620
00:46:57,857 --> 00:47:01,069
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

621
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,992
You must trust me.

622
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:23,049
I want to take a look at the
right frontal lobe.

623
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:25,009
I'll open the skull here..

624
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:28,012
I don't want to know.

625
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:31,349
Just help him.

626
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:55,039
Please, doctor.

627
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:58,126
Please let me talk to him.

628
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,795
No.

629
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:05,091
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

630
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:10,346
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

631
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,895
Or if you're ever lonely.

632
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:24,402
I know you're all by yourself now.

633
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,622
I'm going to take care
of him, doctor,

634
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,167
and I'm going to find out
what happened to him.

635
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,710
What are you doing here?

636
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,296
I've been waiting for you.

637
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,467
I have to tell you.

638
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,888
What did you do to him?

639
00:49:33,972 --> 00:49:38,518
What did you and West do
to him to make him like that?

640
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:42,981
It was.. it was horrible.

641
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:46,567
I didn't..

642
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:49,028
What did you do to him?

643
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,662
He's not insane.

644
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,169
He's dead.

645
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:09,549
No. No.

646
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:13,136
You're insane,
you are insane, no!

647
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,179
You know it's true, Meg.

648
00:50:15,263 --> 00:50:16,806
You know it's true.

649
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,018
No.

650
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:29,027
Daddy. Daddy.

651
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:36,034
I'll tell you, Meg, everything.

652
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:50,798
Good evening, Mr. West.

653
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:57,805
What do you want?

654
00:50:57,889 --> 00:51:00,892
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrillated.

655
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,310
I don't have to talk to you.

656
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,062
Why his pulse is erratic.

657
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:06,230
I've told everything I know
to the police.

658
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:08,566
Why he cries out in pain.

659
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,068
You can leave now, doctor.

660
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:14,864
When we both know
he is quite dead.

661
00:51:21,329 --> 00:51:25,083
Interesting little laboratory
you have here.

662
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:30,463
Mr. West, I recognize this?

663
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,634
What do you want?

664
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:38,846
Yes, we are both scientists.

665
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,891
Let us get to the point.

666
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:49,107
I want your discovery.

667
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,985
Whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

668
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:55,279
Oh, it is not the appearance
of life, it is life.

669
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:59,617
This is not magic, as you say,
I am a scientist.

670
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:03,204
I'll have you locked up
for a madman..

671
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,373
or a murderer.

672
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:14,632
You will do..

673
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,385
what I tell you to do.

674
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,921
Ingenious, Mr. West.

675
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:59,260
Your extension of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite..

676
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,386
brilliant.

677
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,992
Has Dr. Hill examined
your father?

678
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,368
Yes.

679
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:28,080
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

680
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,416
Oh, shit.

681
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:33,628
Then he'll find out.

682
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:36,881
Eventually he'll find out.

683
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:39,926
Let us see..

684
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:43,387
my new serum at work?

685
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,267
Dead cat tissue.

686
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:57,276
Reagent.

687
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,510
Magnificent.

688
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:43,906
Yes, Mr. West.

689
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:48,452
I will be famous.

690
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,924
Laid to rest.

691
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:50,598
Yes.

692
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:57,104
Parts.

693
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:02,360
I've never done whole parts.

694
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:56,664
Wesssssst

695
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,919
Yes, doctor.

696
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,588
It's Herbert West.

697
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:05,840
What are you thinking?

698
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:09,844
How do you feel?

699
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,431
Yooooooou.

700
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:14,598
" You."

701
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:20,438
Baaassstaaard

702
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,285
Dan!

703
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:01,580
Oh my god, what has Hill
done to him?

704
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:11,090
Looks like a laser drill.

705
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,800
Your father's been lobotomized.

706
00:59:58,345 --> 01:00:01,599
That's it.

707
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,852
My work! My work!

708
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:05,894
What's going on?

709
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,731
My work is gone.

710
01:00:08,814 --> 01:00:10,774
It's all gone.

711
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,359
He took my serum!

712
01:00:12,443 --> 01:00:13,777
Except for what
I have upstairs.

713
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,279
Who?

714
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,697
What happened here?

715
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,157
Hill.

716
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,201
Hill took my serum!
My notes! Everything.

717
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:22,286
Herbert, you're insane!

718
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,538
- Now, what happened here?
- I had to kill him.

719
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:26,790
What?

720
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:30,628
He's dead?

721
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,923
- Not any more.
- No, Herbert.

722
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,175
This has gotta stop!

723
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,801
Look, he tried
to blackmail me, Dan.

724
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:38,802
Enough is enough!

725
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,512
And he wanted you to disappear!

726
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:54,652
Oh. Oh.

727
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,362
Oh, that's why he did
it to Halsey.

728
01:00:56,445 --> 01:00:57,696
What? You've seen Halsey?

729
01:00:57,780 --> 01:01:00,949
He lobotomized him, so he could
control him in case

730
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:03,285
he ever tried to talk or tell
somebody what happened.

731
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:05,663
So he could protect <i>his</i> discovery.

732
01:01:05,704 --> 01:01:07,414
- Yes.
- Very clever.

733
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,041
I gotta tell Meg.

734
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,001
What does Meg
have to do with this?

735
01:01:11,085 --> 01:01:12,419
Hill's got this weird file on her,

736
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,005
it's full of napkins and hair
and photographs.

737
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:17,549
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need onto her.

738
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,776
Yes.

739
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,959
Alan.

740
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,844
Alan.

741
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:59,962
Oh.. yes..

742
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:03,549
Alan.

743
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:10,848
It's.. time for you..

744
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:14,643
to come out now.

745
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,177
Is that you, Dr. Hill?

746
01:04:49,261 --> 01:04:50,554
Of course it's me.

747
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:05,193
Break time.

748
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:37,935
That's.. better.

749
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:27,985
Meg? Meg!

750
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:31,446
Dan? Dan..

751
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:35,033
- I was so afraid.
- What is it?

752
01:06:35,117 --> 01:06:37,119
What's the matter?

753
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:41,373
Well.. I don't know.

754
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,500
I was just worried about you.

755
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,254
Why?

756
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:52,050
L..l just feel horrible
about everything.

757
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:57,264
I guess I'm just getting paranoid.

758
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:03,353
It's just..

759
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:05,022
so hard to lose you.

760
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:10,110
You should go away.

761
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:15,365
Transfer to another school.

762
01:07:15,449 --> 01:07:17,451
Don't worry about me.

763
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:22,414
You're the one
that should get away.

764
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:26,376
Go live your life.

765
01:07:30,464 --> 01:07:33,216
Find somebody.

766
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:35,343
I tried to hate you.

767
01:07:38,764 --> 01:07:41,600
I wanted so much to hate you.

768
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:49,107
I love you.

769
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:52,903
No! Daddy!

770
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:57,324
Dr. Halsey.

771
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,242
No, Daddy!

772
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,457
Oh, no, Daddy!

773
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,834
Daddy! Daddy!

774
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:23,850
The door.

775
01:09:05,392 --> 01:09:08,019
Oh.. yes.

776
01:09:54,191 --> 01:09:59,196
Dan? Dan?

777
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:01,364
Dan?

778
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,201
Come on.

779
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:08,747
Oh, well, you'll be all right.

780
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,208
Meg!

781
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:12,500
Oh my god.

782
01:10:12,584 --> 01:10:14,002
Where, Herbert?

783
01:10:14,085 --> 01:10:16,880
He's at the hospital I imagine.
Can you stand up?

784
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,215
Let's go.

785
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,137
Oh.. Meg.

786
01:11:08,265 --> 01:11:10,976
I've.. always..

787
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:15,563
admired your beauty, my dear.

788
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:22,320
I think I've always loved you.

789
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,415
You will love me.

790
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,215
You will.

791
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:46,511
Please!

792
01:11:46,594 --> 01:11:48,596
Please stop!

793
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,307
Let me go!

794
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,810
That's it, my dearest Meg..

795
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:56,563
more passion!

796
01:11:59,691 --> 01:12:04,321
- Oh my god!
- Yes, my love!

797
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:07,324
I must say, Dr. Hill..

798
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,077
I'm very disappointed in you.

799
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:13,663
You steal the secret
of life and death,

800
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:17,000
and here you are trysting
with the bubble-headed coed,

801
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,878
you're not even
a second-rate scientist.

802
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:23,214
Mr. West.

803
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,468
I'm actually glad to see you.

804
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:32,974
It saves me the trouble
of having to send for you.

805
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,352
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

806
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,062
Who's gonna believe
a talking head?

807
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,938
Get a job in a sideshow.

808
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,358
I wonder why

809
01:12:41,441 --> 01:12:45,820
an intelligent young man like yourself

810
01:12:47,572 --> 01:12:52,285
should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake,

811
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:56,247
of coming here to challenge me.

812
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:00,418
Oh.. l have a plan.

813
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:04,672
So do I.

814
01:13:21,731 --> 01:13:23,650
Let go of me!

815
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,921
Enough!

816
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:02,772
I will show you power, Mr. West!

817
01:14:02,856 --> 01:14:04,983
My discovery,

818
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:07,902
a laser surgical drill.

819
01:14:07,986 --> 01:14:12,073
It makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy,

820
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,120
which results in total mastery

821
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,289
of the human will.

822
01:14:19,372 --> 01:14:22,375
Re-animated subjects

823
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:25,587
have proven to be the best.

824
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:29,466
They will give me power!

825
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:32,802
Undreamed of power.

826
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:37,182
Stay behind me.

827
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,896
Daddy, listen to me.

828
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,231
It's Megan, Megan!

829
01:14:45,315 --> 01:14:49,235
- Hill, they'll kill her!
- Then I'll give her life!

830
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,615
Look at me!

831
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:57,887
Meg, come on!

832
01:15:57,971 --> 01:15:59,722
Let's go! Come on!

833
01:15:59,806 --> 01:16:00,723
Wait!

834
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,475
I am not through here!

835
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,894
Megan, no!

836
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:08,439
- Let me go!
- I told you, I have a theory!

837
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,775
- Overdose!
- No!

838
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:06,706
Herbert!

839
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:27,894
Look out!

840
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,445
Daddy!

841
01:17:46,913 --> 01:17:47,914
My notes.

842
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:51,918
MY notes!

843
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,298
Let's go.

844
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,704
Come on!

845
01:19:38,024 --> 01:19:39,150
My god! Megan!

846
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,193
Take her into number three!

847
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,653
Bring her this way!

848
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:49,952
Hurry, hurry,
she's got nothing.

849
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:52,622
Activating.

850
01:19:52,705 --> 01:19:53,831
Air on.

851
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:02,590
Somebody give me some paste!

852
01:20:02,673 --> 01:20:03,883
On three.

853
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,386
Okay, everybody off.

854
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:10,348
Clear.

855
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:15,394
Nothing.

856
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:17,980
Bringing back air.

857
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,819
The trachea's fractured.

858
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,195
She's fixed and dilated.

859
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:26,739
No response.

860
01:20:31,202 --> 01:20:35,081
Cain.. Cain.

861
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:15,932
I love you.

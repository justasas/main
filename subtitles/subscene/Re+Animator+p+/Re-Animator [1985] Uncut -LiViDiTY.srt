1
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,825
Dr. Gruber!

2
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,165
<i>Doctor!</i>

3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,416
<i>Mr. West!</i>

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,629
<i>Mr. West!</i>

5
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>Get out!</i>

6
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,053
<i>Move back.</i>

7
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,590
My god.

8
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,639
You idiots!
You'll ruin my notes.

9
00:01:15,674 --> 00:01:17,175
I have to record
his vital signs!

10
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:19,205
No!

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,625
Dr. Gruber?

12
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:25,336
<i>Dr. Gruber, How this happened?</i>

13
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,675
Dr. Gruber?

14
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>He's dead.</i>

15
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,364
Of course, he's dead,
the dosage was too large.

16
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,623
You killed him.

17
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,826
No, I did not.

18
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,621
I gave him life.

19
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,336
All right,
I'm gonna zap her again.

20
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,172
Charge up the paddles.

21
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,215
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

22
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,134
Sorry, doctor.

23
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,178
Hold the compressions.

24
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,139
Clear!

25
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,978
Straight line.

26
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,858
All right, let's call it.

27
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,775
Cain.

28
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,987
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

29
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,697
Cain, we have done everything

30
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,741
that can be done for this woman.

31
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,701
She has not responded.

32
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,913
She's gone!

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,635
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

34
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,888
A good doctor
knows when to stop.

35
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,889
- Dr. Harrod, just...
- Take her.

36
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,100
And take her to the morgue.

37
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,938
Gangway...

38
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,533
Mr. Cain.

39
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,868
Hey, Mace!

40
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,203
I got another one for you.

41
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,289
They ain't locked.
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

42
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,541
Oh, thanks.

43
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,752
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here.

44
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,254
Nobody wants in...

45
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,006
and ain't nobody gettin' out.

46
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,884
Yup.

47
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,124
Full house.

48
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,181
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't mean to scare you.

49
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,348
Oh, it wasn't too bad
Dean Halsey.

50
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,100
I just didn't know anybody was here.

51
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,144
You mean, "anybody else".

52
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,645
Dan, this is Herbert West.

53
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,355
He'll be joining you
in your third year.

54
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,316
He was doing independent
research in Switzerland

55
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,193
with Dr. Gruber shortly before he died.

56
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,653
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain.

57
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,071
(One of Miskatonic Medical's

58
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,366
best young hopes
for the future of medicine.

59
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,784
What were you researching?

60
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,244
Death.

61
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,331
Alan, we don't see you
around here much anymore.

62
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, I was just showing
our newest student,

63
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
Herbert West here,
the not-so-grand tour.

64
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,295
This should interest you, Carl.

65
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,965
He worked with Hans Gruber.

66
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,675
Mr. West?

67
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,431
This is our eminent brain researcher
and grant machine, Dr. Carl Hill.

68
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,517
I know your work, Dr. Hill.

69
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,352
Quite well.

70
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

71
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,190
interesting...

72
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,735
though derivative of Dr. Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

73
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,113
So derivative, in fact, that in Europe
it's considered plagiarized.

74
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:54,076
And your support of the 12-minute limit on
the life of the brain stem after death...

75
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,079
Six to 12 minutes, Mr...

76
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,998
West. Herbert West.

77
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,168
Frankly, Dr. Hill?

78
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,587
Your work on brain death
is outdated.

79
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,801
Carl, while I remember,

80
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,387
we're having a grant committee
meeting Thursday.

81
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,014
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

82
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,307
Well, I'd love to, Alan,

83
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,393
looking forward to it.

84
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,146
And looking forward to
seeing you in class, Mr. West.

85
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,233
Ah, Dean Halsey, I don't know if this is
the right time. But I've been so busy, I...

86
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:38,015
No, this is the perfect time.
What is it?

87
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:42,066
I wondered if you could write me
a letter of recommendation for the...

88
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:44,232
Wellmont Scholarship.

89
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:47,356
Well, absolutely.
Of course.

90
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:51,361
I was going to suggest that you apply.
It's a very prestigious scholarship, Dan.

91
00:09:51,362 --> 00:09:53,383
- It will do good things to your career.
- Thank you.

92
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,603
- Mr. West, I'll take you to pathology.
- Good.

93
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:25,552
Hi.

94
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:31,957
No. No.

95
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:34,444
Oh yes! Oh!

96
00:10:58,644 --> 00:11:02,701
- How was that?
- You worry too much, Dan.

97
00:11:06,677 --> 00:11:09,260
Okay girl, medical school
as I know 'em, uh?

98
00:11:10,392 --> 00:11:12,611
- Rufus!
- Hi Rufus.

99
00:11:12,613 --> 00:11:13,811
Hi!

100
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:15,231
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Rufus.

101
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,743
Where have you been?
Come on here.

102
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,121
Yeah, usually you're always bothering us.

103
00:11:19,122 --> 00:11:20,985
Yeah, he likes his new home.

104
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:24,838
Lots of new corners
and closets to hide in.

105
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,748
You can see him all day yesterday.

106
00:11:26,749 --> 00:11:28,322
Goodnight, come on.

107
00:11:28,523 --> 00:11:31,080
It's a nice place, Dan.
I really like it.

108
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,664
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

109
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:36,297
So why don't you move in with me?

110
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:40,104
Please don't start, you know I can't.

111
00:11:41,737 --> 00:11:43,108
You know...

112
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:48,378
It's alright for two people who love
each other... to live together.

113
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:50,971
Yeah, I know.
But not me.

114
00:11:50,972 --> 00:11:54,414
And especially not in front
of daddy's students, okay?

115
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:59,161
Oh! I'm not sure, but I think that
violates one of my civil rights.

116
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:01,438
You'll find a roommate.

117
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,613
Yeah, well better.

118
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,286
I can't afford this place by myself.

119
00:12:08,489 --> 00:12:10,400
You know any eligible nurses?

120
00:12:10,801 --> 00:12:13,044
Hey! That's not fair.

121
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,612
Oh oh...

122
00:12:22,152 --> 00:12:24,700
Hey, you have a beautiful body.

123
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:26,911
- You do.
- Yes.

124
00:12:27,312 --> 00:12:29,503
Somehow I'm not sure
that's a compliment.

125
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:33,215
Coming from someone who spends
most of his time with cadavers.

126
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:38,118
Hey, dead body, is best cadavers.

127
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,655
It's beautiful.

128
00:12:40,356 --> 00:12:45,106
Besides, you know...
It just don't jump when you tickle.

129
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,948
Dan! Don't!
I hate that.

130
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,422
Stop! Don't...
Don't tickle me.

131
00:12:52,223 --> 00:12:54,233
- Stop!
- Okay.

132
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,120
Rufus.

133
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:07,466
I have to go.

134
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:12,344
No, stay.

135
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:13,994
Daddy knows I'm here.

136
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,826
I don't care
what Dean Halsey knows.

137
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,267
Oh you should care.
For his sake, mine and...

138
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,706
I want you again.

139
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,221
No...

140
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:24,800
Be reasonable.

141
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:27,260
If I didn't come home
all night...

142
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:28,172
just one night...

143
00:13:29,022 --> 00:13:30,620
What would he do?

144
00:13:30,623 --> 00:13:31,640
Expel me?

145
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:34,298
He has too much integrity for that.

146
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,811
He likes you, you know?

147
00:13:38,212 --> 00:13:39,541
I like him.

148
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:41,444
He's out of touch with the times.

149
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,196
That's just the way he is,

150
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,740
the world's last living Puritan.

151
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,787
I really hated it.

152
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:37,689
The day that you graduate,

153
00:14:37,772 --> 00:14:41,559
the minute you get your M.D.,
I'll marry you,

154
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:44,728
and I'll help you, and I'll be with you

155
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,025
as much as I can until then.

156
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:49,575
I promise.

157
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,526
Back to square one.

158
00:14:53,611 --> 00:14:57,702
Well, at least it gives me
a chance to housebreak you.

159
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,616
Housebroken, is it?

160
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:10,044
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, my girl.

161
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,380
What are you doing?

162
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,832
Dan.

163
00:15:16,178 --> 00:15:19,224
Dan... stop, don't.

164
00:15:20,391 --> 00:15:21,735
Dan, stop it!

165
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:22,954
Come, my pretty.

166
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:24,544
Dan, I don't like that.

167
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:30,111
There's not a jury in the world
that would convict me.

168
00:15:30,194 --> 00:15:31,562
Dan, stop it!

169
00:15:31,647 --> 00:15:33,865
Doctor Dan!

170
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:37,118
Dan, don't, come on, stop.

171
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,286
I really have to go.

172
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:39,829
Come here! Come to me.

173
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,958
- Oh.
- What?

174
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:45,845
Oh, shit.

175
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:47,197
Hi.

176
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:48,411
Can I help you?

177
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:51,686
You're here about
the apartment, huh?

178
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,546
Yes.

179
00:15:53,972 --> 00:15:56,057
Didn't we meet this morning?
You're...

180
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,017
West. Herbert West.

181
00:15:58,102 --> 00:16:00,603
West.
Excuse me just one sec.

182
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,017
Come in.

183
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,037
Thank you.

184
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:13,785
I startled you.

185
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:15,996
Yes, you did.

186
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,461
May I introduce my fiance,
Megan Halsey?

187
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:24,715
- Miss Halsey.
- Mr. West.

188
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,009
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr. West.

189
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,387
Oh... Herbert.

190
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,943
So, you've
just come from Europe?

191
00:16:43,027 --> 00:16:45,448
Switzerland.

192
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,868
What was Dr. Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

193
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,493
Yes, pretty famous...

194
00:16:49,577 --> 00:16:52,121
Does this building
have a basement?

195
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,629
Oh, yes.

196
00:17:02,091 --> 00:17:04,553
Yes.

197
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:07,430
I think this will be just fine.

198
00:17:07,513 --> 00:17:09,850
I have my things outside,
shall I move in now?

199
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:12,978
Look, I have to go.

200
00:17:13,062 --> 00:17:15,190
I think you and Mr. West
have a lot to discuss

201
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:16,607
before you decide anything.

202
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:19,694
Oh, I've decided.

203
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:20,787
Well, I'd like to...

204
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,750
You know, you'll never even
know that I'm here.

205
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:23,570
Dan, I...

206
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,241
Except, of course,
on the first of the month.

207
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,869
Mr. West?

208
00:17:26,953 --> 00:17:28,247
Miss Halsey?

209
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,250
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

210
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:36,456
Cause there was no more
I could learn there.

211
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,179
Do we... have a deal?

212
00:17:47,852 --> 00:17:49,271
Done.

213
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,024
Done.

214
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:57,321
You make the incision
at the base of the skull...

215
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:13,798
cutting away
enough of the faschia...

216
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:18,721
to get your fingers in...

217
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:25,978
and then grasping firmly
with both hands,

218
00:18:26,062 --> 00:18:31,152
you pull the skin forward
over the head,

219
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,239
very much like peeling
a large orange.

220
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:42,707
Once the skull is plainly visible,

221
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,918
you take the bone saw...

222
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,172
And you cut around the perimeter.

223
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:05,691
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

224
00:19:05,774 --> 00:19:08,068
the human brain.

225
00:19:08,194 --> 00:19:10,964
Once the brain stem
of an individual,

226
00:19:11,048 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm talking about the reticular
activating system,

227
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,779
heart regulation,
respiratory center.

228
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,123
Once these activities cease,

229
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:24,504
the brain can only survive
an additional six to 12 minutes.

230
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:27,466
Six to 12 minutes.

231
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:32,513
Until...

232
00:19:32,598 --> 00:19:37,143
brain death brings about
an irreversible conclusion.

233
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,725
We all want to retain
our personalities

234
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,078
in some idyllic afterlife.

235
00:19:52,161 --> 00:19:54,998
We all pray for some miracle,

236
00:19:55,081 --> 00:19:58,709
some drug, potion, pill.

237
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:09,430
Perhaps, though,
it takes something else.

238
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:13,978
Perhaps it takes desire,
an obsessive desire.

239
00:20:14,061 --> 00:20:16,480
Perhaps it take...

240
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:26,358
We will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure

241
00:20:26,484 --> 00:20:29,578
at another time.

242
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,748
Mr. West!

243
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,169
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

244
00:20:37,004 --> 00:20:38,422
Class dismissed.

245
00:20:40,926 --> 00:20:42,710
How can you teach such drivel?

246
00:20:42,794 --> 00:20:44,755
These people are here to learn
and you're closing their minds

247
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:45,807
before they even have a chance!

248
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:47,308
What are you here for,
Mr. West?

249
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,510
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas,

250
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:50,829
then at least you'd have ideas!

251
00:20:50,912 --> 00:20:52,814
Mr. West!

252
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:58,446
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

253
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:09,667
I would like to propose a toast

254
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,878
to the National Science Foundation

255
00:21:11,961 --> 00:21:16,215
for recognizing the genius
of Dr. Carl Hill,

256
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:20,646
and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

257
00:21:20,688 --> 00:21:22,173
its largest grant ever.

258
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,519
Your new laser drill is going
to revolutionize neurosurgery.

259
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:32,035
To the foundation,
and to Miskatonic.

260
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:37,056
It's all right, sweetheart,
you can drink up.

261
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,283
We're celebrating.

262
00:21:38,367 --> 00:21:40,452
I know, Daddy,
but I have to go soon.

263
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:44,248
After preparing such a feast,
you must be tired.

264
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:45,999
I have a study date.

265
00:21:46,084 --> 00:21:47,460
With Daniel?

266
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:49,129
Yeah.

267
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:50,463
Daniel Cain'?

268
00:21:51,924 --> 00:21:54,928
Herbert West has moved in
with him, hasn't he?

269
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,678
For the time being.

270
00:21:57,463 --> 00:21:59,641
That must be him.
Excuse me.

271
00:22:03,896 --> 00:22:06,932
So, your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

272
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,572
You think that's wise, Alan'?

273
00:22:11,655 --> 00:22:12,781
Dan!

274
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:14,415
Hello, sir.

275
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,243
Dr. Hill.

276
00:22:16,327 --> 00:22:18,258
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

277
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:22,042
Actually, we have some
work to do.

278
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,585
Why don't you study here?

279
00:22:23,668 --> 00:22:27,089
Well, I've her home soon,
don't worry.

280
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:31,429
Well then, one last toast?

281
00:22:33,013 --> 00:22:34,848
To Megan...

282
00:22:34,932 --> 00:22:38,977
my esteemed colleague's capable,

283
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,566
beautiful, loving daughter,

284
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:46,431
the obsession of all
who fall under her spell.

285
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,946
- I'll drink to that.
- Hear, hear.

286
00:22:58,081 --> 00:22:59,788
Are you sure you won't
stay with us here?

287
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,643
We promise not to take two boys.

288
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,015
And you're a little tired my dear.

289
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,869
Very tired.

290
00:23:11,897 --> 00:23:14,213
Um, no! That's okay.

291
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:16,681
You two have a good time.

292
00:23:18,198 --> 00:23:19,350
Bye daddy.

293
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,135
Now, don't be too late.

294
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:23,681
I'll see you soon.
Dr Hill.

295
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:31,261
How about some brandy.

296
00:23:32,932 --> 00:23:35,978
Your daughter has grown into
an enchanting young woman.

297
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,627
Oh yes, she has.

298
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,111
You know, since Marianne died,

299
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:47,269
she's taken care of the
house, the cooking and me.

300
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,585
It'll be a shame when she leaves.

301
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:54,226
She deserves the best, Alan.

302
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:58,499
Someone clearly superior.

303
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:01,243
Oh, give the boy a chance.

304
00:24:01,344 --> 00:24:03,937
He's a very good scholar.

305
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:08,371
He needs our help, Carl.

306
00:24:08,372 --> 00:24:10,968
He deserves the Wellmont Scholarship.

307
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,797
Oh, but I don't know, Alan.

308
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:13,998
Perhaps...

309
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:17,561
But I can't help wondering...

310
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:21,197
Is he morally fit to be a doctor.

311
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:28,644
Well, as you said,
he's a clever young man.

312
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:32,302
He knows full well, he's
chasing the Dean's daughter.

313
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:36,610
He could be using her to
gain an advantage with you.

314
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:39,589
I suspected the same
thing in the beginning.

315
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,521
He's proven himself to
be a perfect gentleman.

316
00:24:42,622 --> 00:24:46,386
Oh, of course.
But after he gets the scholarship?

317
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:48,703
He won't need her then.

318
00:24:50,336 --> 00:24:51,925
I don't believe that.

319
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:56,175
I trust him.
Meg trust him.

320
00:24:56,176 --> 00:25:00,975
Meg has matured a great
deal in the past few years,

321
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:04,839
but she's still young
and impressionable.

322
00:25:06,842 --> 00:25:11,339
And now Cain is rooming
with that West character.

323
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:15,409
West is a strange bird,
I'll agree to that.

324
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,515
He's a cancer, Alan.

325
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:23,786
His intelligence is highly questionable.

326
00:25:24,587 --> 00:25:27,037
He's disrespectful,

327
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:29,406
teller of lies about the staff.

328
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:35,254
I think he's deranged...
dangerous.

329
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:39,719
- Dangerous?
- Yes, Alan.

330
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,805
And Cain is with him all the time.

331
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:46,556
And with your daughter.

332
00:25:47,557 --> 00:25:50,934
Cain is dangerous.

333
00:25:50,935 --> 00:25:52,797
He's dangerous?

334
00:25:52,998 --> 00:25:58,037
To school... and to your daughter.

335
00:25:58,738 --> 00:26:05,021
Your beautiful, young,
loving daughter.

336
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:10,329
At the end of this...
my daughter.

337
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,458
What is this?

338
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:31,009
It's nothing.

339
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,264
What's the matter?

340
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,030
Nothing.

341
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:44,781
He's not here, you know?
He's still on shift in the hospital.

342
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:48,031
- It's not West.
- No.

343
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,967
You know, every since he
moved in you come over last night

344
00:26:51,968 --> 00:26:55,315
and when you do you're in a
case of repressed hysteria.

345
00:26:56,143 --> 00:26:59,901
Oh, I'm sorry Danny,
but he makes my skin crawl.

346
00:27:00,102 --> 00:27:03,518
Well, he's just one of
your typical genius.

347
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:07,820
He's uh, very intelligent,
he's very private

348
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:09,464
didn't quite act like other people.

349
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:12,263
But he's been no problem, really.

350
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,064
Yeah.

351
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:35,242
No, Dan.
No!

352
00:27:36,661 --> 00:27:39,373
Please!

353
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:41,021
Okay, what is it?

354
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:43,215
I don't know, it's...

355
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,000
Look, it's not you, really.

356
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,320
It's just a lot of little things.

357
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:49,758
Like what?

358
00:27:49,884 --> 00:27:52,628
Well, West is always in his room
with the door closed.

359
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,417
I mean, do you ever see him?

360
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:56,056
Does he ever eat?

361
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,108
I told you, he's a little cracked.

362
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,156
He bothers you, too.

363
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:05,467
No, don't be ridiculous.

364
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:07,234
Rufus is terrified of him.

365
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,290
When West comes in,
he runs and hides.

366
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,897
Rufus runs and hides all the time,

367
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,073
it's standard cat activity.

368
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:13,158
Yes, but not when we're together,

369
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:15,202
then he's all over us trying
to get your attention and...

370
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,289
Where is he?

371
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:19,790
I haven't seen him
since we got here.

372
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,082
It's okay, he's around here.

373
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,168
I haven't even heard him,

374
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,920
usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

375
00:28:27,341 --> 00:28:29,468
Pss pss pss pss.

376
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:33,971
Rufus... Rufus... Rufus.

377
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:35,182
Pss pss pss pss.

378
00:28:35,265 --> 00:28:38,768
Come on, you fat cat.

379
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:40,212
Here, kitty!

380
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:42,005
Rufus.

381
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,424
Come on now, you mad animal.

382
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:46,569
Don't you try to hide from me.

383
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:49,113
I know all of your tricks.

384
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:52,116
Rufus?
Where are you, boy?

385
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:54,118
Here, kitty.

386
00:28:54,202 --> 00:28:56,245
Here, kitty!

387
00:28:57,956 --> 00:28:59,290
Here, kitty.

388
00:29:04,545 --> 00:29:08,217
Rufus. Hey, boy!

389
00:29:19,813 --> 00:29:22,440
Rufus?

390
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:28,739
Rufus?

391
00:29:30,699 --> 00:29:32,533
Rufus.

392
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:41,210
Rufus?

393
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:50,137
Hey, boy.

394
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,354
Rufus, are you in here?

395
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:07,238
Here, boy.

396
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,281
Here, kitty.

397
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,257
Rufus?

398
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,849
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

399
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,557
What are you doing in my room?

400
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:37,299
- How dare you come in...
- Dan! Dan!

401
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,981
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

402
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:42,609
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

403
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:43,860
Meg, what the hell
are you doing in here?

404
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,819
- I...
- Would you please leave, now!

405
00:30:46,103 --> 00:30:48,074
Easy!

406
00:30:48,157 --> 00:30:49,366
In the fridge.

407
00:30:59,668 --> 00:31:01,421
I was going to show you.

408
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:03,506
Shut up.

409
00:31:08,554 --> 00:31:10,263
What happened?

410
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:13,390
It was dead when I found it.

411
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,477
You killed him.

412
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,271
He hated you!

413
00:31:17,354 --> 00:31:20,150
Meg. It suffocated.

414
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:27,281
It knocked the garbage over and
it got its head stuck in a jar.

415
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,384
You weren't home,
so I put it in there.

416
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:30,994
I certainly didn't think
you'd want to find it like that.

417
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,913
I didn't want
to stink the place up.

418
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:34,956
I was going to show you.

419
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,824
You couldn't call, or write a note?

420
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:39,051
I was busy pushing bodies around,
as you well know,

421
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:40,537
and what would a note say, Dan?

422
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:42,631
"Cat dead, details later"?

423
00:31:42,715 --> 00:31:43,857
I knew you were fond of it.

424
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:45,309
You killed him, I know you did.

425
00:31:45,335 --> 00:31:46,438
He killed him.

426
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:47,836
Besides, I do not
like people in my room!

427
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,390
All right, that's enough.

428
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,182
I think you both better leave, now.

429
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:01,441
- What the hell is this?
- That is none of your business.

430
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:02,403
Yeah, I think it is my business!

431
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:03,528
Just as it is none of my business

432
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,439
that you're sleeping
with Dean Halsey's daughter.

433
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,327
You know, I would not want
to see a fellow student,

434
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:12,363
especially one
as promising as yourself,

435
00:32:12,405 --> 00:32:14,540
be thrown out of school,
out of the profession...

436
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:17,970
on moral ground.

437
00:32:18,211 --> 00:32:20,296
I think Dr. Halsey
just might understand.

438
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,049
Oh, do you?

439
00:32:22,175 --> 00:32:24,593
Well, you may well be right.

440
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:28,430
Are you sure you want
to find out?

441
00:33:54,655 --> 00:33:55,866
Herbert?

442
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,135
Herbert.

443
00:33:58,777 --> 00:34:00,043
Herbert!

444
00:34:00,078 --> 00:34:01,645
You hear that sound?

445
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:05,821
West! West!

446
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,880
West, what is that?

447
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,312
Quiet!

448
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,826
Get off of...

449
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,361
Cain!

450
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,119
Get out of here!

451
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,161
Get it off of me!

452
00:34:57,847 --> 00:34:59,142
Stay away!

453
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,950
Later!

454
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:07,317
Aw, shit.

455
00:35:08,526 --> 00:35:10,363
There he is! Shit.

456
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,124
Don't move.

457
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,194
Look out!

458
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:27,792
There it goes under the stairs,
it's under the stairs.

459
00:35:36,932 --> 00:35:39,350
Okay, I got it.

460
00:35:39,434 --> 00:35:41,478
I got it.

461
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:09,549
Oh.

462
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:11,093
Look out!

463
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:38,989
It's really quite simple.

464
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:41,263
All life is a physical
and chemical process, correct?

465
00:36:41,558 --> 00:36:45,521
It stands to reason then, that if one
could find extremely fresh specimens

466
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:49,023
and recharge that chemical process,
bang, we have re-animation.

467
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:53,694
- The theory is not new, West.
- But my reagent is.

468
00:36:54,077 --> 00:36:55,363
Read.

469
00:36:59,576 --> 00:37:01,245
"With various animating solutions,"

470
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:03,139
"I have killed and brought
to animated life,"

471
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:07,260
"a number of rabbits,
guinea pigs, cats, and dogs."

472
00:37:07,344 --> 00:37:09,612
I've broken the 6 to 12 minute barrier.

473
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,858
I've conquered brain death.

474
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:16,544
"With the higher animals
and the consequent"

475
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:20,212
increased strength of solution,
reaction has become more violent...

476
00:37:21,102 --> 00:37:24,028
and my research
has become more difficult.

477
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:26,196
Which is why
I need you to help me.

478
00:37:27,193 --> 00:37:28,485
Help you?

479
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,731
You are the perfect person
to assist me.

480
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:33,533
You're hard-working, bright,
people respect you,

481
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:37,262
and you have access
to certain authorities.

482
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:41,835
We can defeat death.

483
00:37:41,919 --> 00:37:44,506
We can achieve
every doctor's dream.

484
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:48,336
You'll be famous... and live lifetimes.

485
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,598
You haven't done this on people?

486
00:37:56,262 --> 00:37:58,272
I've done all I can here.

487
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:02,010
I'll need new lab space.

488
00:38:02,093 --> 00:38:04,011
You will help me.

489
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:06,722
- No!
- Why? Because it's mad?

490
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:08,434
No, because I don't
believe you.

491
00:38:08,518 --> 00:38:10,435
How can you say that?
You've seen the results.

492
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,731
No, Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

493
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:14,481
You drugged him
and reduced his vital signs.

494
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:15,691
You lowered his body temperature.

495
00:38:15,817 --> 00:38:16,900
He couldn't have been dead.

496
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:18,568
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

497
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:21,824
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

498
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:31,585
West, no!

499
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,298
West, stop!

500
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,426
I'll show you.

501
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,221
- Then you'll help me.
- No!

502
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:42,429
Yes, you will.

503
00:38:42,514 --> 00:38:46,102
That is why I brought the infernal beast
back to life in the first place.

504
00:38:51,899 --> 00:38:53,734
- In the brain?
- Of course.

505
00:38:57,904 --> 00:39:01,785
Don't expect it to tango,
it has a broken back.

506
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:11,043
God! Why does
it make that noise?

507
00:39:11,127 --> 00:39:13,716
Birth is always painful.

508
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:20,012
It was dead.

509
00:39:20,094 --> 00:39:21,473
Twice.

510
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:27,062
- Oh, it's him!
- Baby, what are you doing here?

511
00:39:27,146 --> 00:39:28,998
It's Rufus! How did...

512
00:39:29,138 --> 00:39:31,735
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

513
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:51,238
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue.

514
00:40:53,543 --> 00:40:57,497
Mr. Cain, I'm surprised.

515
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,581
No, I've seen it.

516
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:02,586
He brought back a dead animal,
a cat, back to life.

517
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:05,672
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr. Cain,

518
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,634
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr. West.

519
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:12,262
I know he's unstable,
but I've seen the results,

520
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,515
and so has your daughter.

521
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,684
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

522
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:19,102
She walked into an experiment.

523
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:22,272
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?

524
00:41:22,356 --> 00:41:24,276
I never intended to involve her.

525
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,238
Tomorrow morning, you will
submit to me a written apology

526
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,032
for this entire affair.

527
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:32,493
These experiments were clearly beyond
the scope of your legitimate studies.

528
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:35,914
They've obviously interfered with
your ability to do your class work.

529
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:40,544
If any equipment from the hospital
or from the laboratories

530
00:41:40,628 --> 00:41:44,131
of Miskatonic University were involved
in any of this unauthorized activity,

531
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:46,092
criminal charges
may be pressed.

532
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:49,805
You will, in any case, have
your student loan rescinded.

533
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:54,894
My loan?

534
00:41:54,976 --> 00:41:57,269
I won't be able to continue school.

535
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,816
As for Mr. West,
he needs submit no apology.

536
00:41:59,898 --> 00:42:03,279
You may tell him that he may
continue with his research

537
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,571
without the impediment
of an education.

538
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,449
As of now, he is no longer
a student of this university.

539
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:11,578
Sir, can we please just discuss this?

540
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,916
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

541
00:42:14,957 --> 00:42:17,544
That will be all, Mr. Cain.

542
00:42:26,137 --> 00:42:28,055
Don't take this out on Meg.

543
00:42:29,098 --> 00:42:30,599
She tried to stop me.

544
00:42:30,683 --> 00:42:33,686
I said that will be all.

545
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:41,041
I'll... I'll talk to him.

546
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:42,493
Won't do any good.

547
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:43,919
He listens to me.

548
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,677
- I got to talk to West.
- You've got to avoid him.

549
00:42:47,378 --> 00:42:48,813
Daddy's angry now.

550
00:42:48,814 --> 00:42:50,962
But he'll listen to me.
He likes you. He always has.

551
00:42:50,963 --> 00:42:53,064
But you've got to separate
yourself from West.

552
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:55,791
Meg! Don't you
understand what he's done?

553
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:57,533
What we could do?

554
00:42:58,134 --> 00:43:00,588
What about what we could do?

555
00:43:03,429 --> 00:43:05,290
I love you.

556
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,213
I love you too.

557
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:15,178
And I accept.

558
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:17,740
What?

559
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:20,849
I accept your proposal.

560
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,177
Oh, let's get married.

561
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:24,978
- Your father...
- It's perfect don't you see?

562
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:26,717
Daddy will have to come
around eventually

563
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:28,956
and West don't
anything to hold over us.

564
00:43:28,957 --> 00:43:30,080
And we'll be together.

565
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:32,846
- Okay, I just have to talk to West...
- No, Dan, don't.

566
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,714
I'll get a job while this blows over.

567
00:43:35,715 --> 00:43:38,143
You keep your job driving...
Daddy will see that we're serious.

568
00:43:38,344 --> 00:43:42,203
Yes, daddy will see that we're serious.

569
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:42,904
West!

570
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:45,094
You still don't believe what you
saw this morning, do you Ms Halsey?

571
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:46,216
Dan, come with me.

572
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,585
West, we've been thrown out of school.

573
00:43:47,586 --> 00:43:48,950
He's threatening to call the police.

574
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:50,405
Oh yes.

575
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:55,129
Curious.
He didn't seem such a fool.

576
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:58,605
He must have been talking to Hill.

577
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:03,376
You're right. He's different.
He's angry from ***

578
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:04,258
What's wrong with you?

579
00:44:04,259 --> 00:44:07,029
He doesn't care about anything
except his own crazy ideas.

580
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:08,167
Can't you see that?

581
00:44:08,168 --> 00:44:11,040
Meg, he's right.
Your father's wrong.

582
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,822
Okay. Okay what do we do now?

583
00:44:15,823 --> 00:44:18,045
- We prove it to him.
- Danny! Listen to me.

584
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,261
It's the only way Danny.

585
00:44:19,262 --> 00:44:21,377
I'll tell daddy that you planned
for all of the experiments.

586
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:24,395
- I'll tell him.
- Please do. Tell Dr Hill too.

587
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,474
Sam! Please.
Please come with me.

588
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:28,386
He is a maniac.
He may even be a murderer.

589
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:29,587
- Meg.
- You're in danger.

590
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:31,980
Meg, we can save millions of lives.

591
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,830
Oh yes. We could
save everyone's life.

592
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:40,043
Okay, we need a lab animal.

593
00:44:41,187 --> 00:44:42,675
I'm gonna tell daddy.

594
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:46,420
He'll stop you. For your
own good Dan. He'll stop you.

595
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:50,948
You know, he'll never
accept an animal subject.

596
00:44:50,949 --> 00:44:54,221
He'll claim it some sort of
artificial stimulus response.

597
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:58,014
There's only one kind
of proof that he'll accept.

598
00:44:58,015 --> 00:44:59,620
That he'll have to accept.

599
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:02,967
- No, no, Herbert we can't do that.
- Oh, yes.

600
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,836
We can.

601
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,891
- Oh, they keep on a comin', don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

602
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:33,194
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have you?

603
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,528
Yeah, one meatball
run over by a semi.

604
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,988
Ew!

605
00:45:37,072 --> 00:45:39,366
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

606
00:45:39,491 --> 00:45:41,993
I might go catch me
some coffee.

607
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:43,578
- Take your time.
- You got it.

608
00:45:52,795 --> 00:45:54,547
Meatball?

609
00:45:54,632 --> 00:45:56,508
Just put your shoes on.

610
00:46:09,437 --> 00:46:10,854
Oh, damn, if we get caught...

611
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:12,856
Oh, well, what will they do?

612
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,691
Embalm us?

613
00:46:14,776 --> 00:46:17,278
Let's go.

614
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:38,090
Burn victim.

615
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:44,678
- Here's your meatball.
- Oh.

616
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,561
Shotgun wound to the head.

617
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:55,731
Oh, god, he's rotten.

618
00:46:58,401 --> 00:47:00,569
- Malpractice.
- Shit.

619
00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:03,572
Let's go, we're not going
to find anything.

620
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,365
Wait. Wait!

621
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:13,038
Yes, I think you.

622
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,874
How long?

623
00:47:14,958 --> 00:47:17,294
He arrived early this evening.

624
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,714
John Doe, apparently just dropped dead.

625
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:22,591
No record of any damage.
It's almost perfect.

626
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,301
Why "almost"?

627
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,387
Could be heart damage.

628
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:28,472
Then let's just find another one.

629
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,599
No! We do not have time!

630
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,516
All we need tonight

631
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,020
is a specific, conscious reaction.

632
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,686
He's been dead for hours.

633
00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:40,066
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness will justify proceeding.

634
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,695
Start the recorder.

635
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:47,781
Start the damn recorder!

636
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:53,037
Make the entry.

637
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,789
October...

638
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:57,791
Tenth.

639
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,918
Tenth.

640
00:47:59,003 --> 00:48:01,462
- Subject: Male.
- Age?

641
00:48:02,545 --> 00:48:05,715
Age, early twenties.

642
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:08,803
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

643
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,513
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

644
00:48:14,848 --> 00:48:17,644
Apparent cause of death...

645
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,357
what?

646
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,484
Heart failure.

647
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:27,028
Heart failure.

648
00:48:29,237 --> 00:48:32,450
Time, 10:33 PM.

649
00:48:32,533 --> 00:48:35,371
10:33 PM.

650
00:48:37,996 --> 00:48:39,998
15 cc's.

651
00:48:42,043 --> 00:48:44,503
15 cc's of reagent being administered.

652
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,805
He loves me,
we're getting married.

653
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:57,765
He's mad! I've seen this happen
to medical students before.

654
00:48:57,849 --> 00:48:59,267
Good ones!

655
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:02,604
Dr. Harrod, is Mr. Cain loose
in this hospital?

656
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:04,605
In the morgue, I think, doctor.

657
00:49:04,689 --> 00:49:07,608
I specifically told
Dr. Riley to suspend him,

658
00:49:07,692 --> 00:49:10,611
and to take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

659
00:49:10,695 --> 00:49:14,116
Dr. Riley's been
in emergency surgery for four hours.

660
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:17,492
I haven't seen him.

661
00:49:17,576 --> 00:49:18,868
Time elapsed.

662
00:49:22,707 --> 00:49:24,584
15 seconds.

663
00:49:26,876 --> 00:49:29,629
Something should
have happened by now.

664
00:49:40,724 --> 00:49:43,810
It's not working.

665
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:44,894
Let's get out of here!

666
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:48,148
Obviously, the human dosage
factor is unknown.

667
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,858
Increasing the dosage,
20 cc's of reagent.

668
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:52,777
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

669
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:19,929
Damn!

670
00:50:20,012 --> 00:50:23,014
Page Mr. Cain and have him report
to Level L security desk,

671
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:26,226
and make sure
that she stays right here.

672
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,771
You can't stop me! I followed you here,
and I'm gonna follow you

673
00:50:28,812 --> 00:50:29,938
- until you listen to me!
- Megan!

674
00:50:30,022 --> 00:50:31,024
- I love him!
- You're my daughter,

675
00:50:31,106 --> 00:50:32,940
and you'll do as you're told!

676
00:50:33,024 --> 00:50:34,942
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

677
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:37,488
Mr. Cain will be up soon,
you can discuss it then.

678
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,406
Don't blame him, Daddy!

679
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,493
We failed.

680
00:50:42,575 --> 00:50:43,784
Come on, let's go!

681
00:50:43,825 --> 00:50:45,369
I mean, someone
could be coming any minute!

682
00:50:45,452 --> 00:50:48,874
He failed! Not I!

683
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,166
<i>Mr. Cain, Mr. Daniel Cain,</i>

684
00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:54,336
<i>please report
to the security desk, Level L</i>

685
00:50:55,337 --> 00:50:56,630
Oh, god.

686
00:50:56,713 --> 00:50:58,382
Cover him up.

687
00:50:59,509 --> 00:51:01,927
- Let's go!
- All right!

688
00:51:20,653 --> 00:51:23,073
Grab him!

689
00:51:26,618 --> 00:51:28,286
Stop!

690
00:51:32,206 --> 00:51:33,583
It listened to me.

691
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:44,051
Cain?

692
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:47,888
Cain?

693
00:51:50,138 --> 00:51:52,058
Cain, open up this door.

694
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:56,146
Help!

695
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:57,563
Get help!

696
00:51:57,646 --> 00:52:00,483
Is West in there with you?

697
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:01,735
You're in a lot of trouble,
both of you!

698
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,967
No!

699
00:52:34,142 --> 00:52:36,142
Let go!

700
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:50,907
Stop!

701
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:52,160
For god's sakes!

702
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,246
Dan... look out.

703
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:29,111
Come on.

704
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:31,197
Find the recorder.

705
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,743
- Herbert... no.
- Did you see him react?

706
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:38,412
He listened to me.
It made a conscious act.

707
00:53:38,496 --> 00:53:41,413
He heard you as an animal would.

708
00:53:42,414 --> 00:53:44,499
Herbert, no, you can't be serious!

709
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,043
Hell, you may be right.

710
00:53:46,126 --> 00:53:47,253
It'd probably been dead too long.

711
00:53:47,337 --> 00:53:49,967
It wasn't fresh enough!

712
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:52,967
We probably only revived the senses
and the instincts, so, come on!

713
00:53:53,008 --> 00:53:55,135
Help me get him up.

714
00:53:55,219 --> 00:53:56,303
Is he dead?

715
00:53:56,386 --> 00:53:58,722
Of course, will you
give me a hand here?

716
00:53:58,807 --> 00:54:01,266
Now, he interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

717
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:02,685
Granted, it was an accident.

718
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:05,145
But this is the freshest body
that we could come across

719
00:54:05,229 --> 00:54:06,396
save of killing one ourselves,

720
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,817
and every moment that we spend
talking about it costs us results!

721
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,899
Now will you give me a hand?

722
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:16,574
Dan, we can bring him back to life.

723
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:31,796
Okay.

724
00:54:39,637 --> 00:54:41,764
Now, get the recorder.

725
00:54:43,224 --> 00:54:44,725
Find my serum.

726
00:54:48,436 --> 00:54:50,314
This is a dream.

727
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:52,483
Fiction.

728
00:54:53,484 --> 00:54:55,278
Here. Do his other hand.

729
00:54:57,402 --> 00:54:59,948
Oh, good.

730
00:55:00,032 --> 00:55:05,829
Unbreakable plastic, one of
man's few durable inventions.

731
00:55:07,912 --> 00:55:09,915
Certainly more durable than this.

732
00:55:11,042 --> 00:55:14,839
We need you in the crash room.

733
00:55:14,922 --> 00:55:16,797
Coming.

734
00:55:45,616 --> 00:55:47,659
12 cc's being administered.

735
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:52,333
The dosage lessened in accordance
to the freshness of the subject.

736
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:11,809
5 seconds.

737
00:56:11,891 --> 00:56:14,145
Come on.

738
00:56:14,228 --> 00:56:17,940
I'll show you.

739
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:22,110
15 seconds. I'll show you!

740
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,654
17 seconds.

741
00:56:23,737 --> 00:56:26,156
Re-animation at 17 seconds!
The eyes opened!

742
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,451
Doctor. Dr. Halsey,

743
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:32,119
you once did me a favor by
letting me into your medical school.

744
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,286
Doctor?

745
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:35,124
Welcome back to life.

746
00:56:58,437 --> 00:57:00,313
Daddy?

747
00:57:00,396 --> 00:57:02,023
Dan?

748
00:57:02,149 --> 00:57:03,568
Damn the bitch.

749
00:57:03,652 --> 00:57:07,322
Megan... Meg?

750
00:57:09,196 --> 00:57:13,870
Dan, what is it,
are you all right?

751
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:22,418
Dan, he's trying to speak,
the recorder!

752
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:26,548
No!

753
00:57:26,631 --> 00:57:28,424
Daddy!

754
00:57:28,507 --> 00:57:29,593
Daddy, no!

755
00:57:29,677 --> 00:57:31,385
No! No, Meg, don't go near him!

756
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:32,386
What the hell happened here?

757
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,347
Dan, you all right?

758
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,222
Who's that?

759
00:57:38,184 --> 00:57:42,063
That is Dean Halsey, sir.

760
00:57:42,189 --> 00:57:45,191
You see I came down here
to visit Mr. Cain,

761
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:48,193
who was here working
and Halsey entered

762
00:57:48,276 --> 00:57:51,197
and started ranting at us,
rather irrationally.

763
00:57:51,279 --> 00:57:52,698
No!

764
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:55,242
He was just angry!

765
00:57:55,325 --> 00:57:56,286
Daddy!

766
00:57:56,368 --> 00:57:57,327
Meg. What happened?

767
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,493
Who's that over there?

768
00:57:58,577 --> 00:58:00,372
Just a corpse.

769
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:03,878
You see, Halsey came in,
grabbed that thing,

770
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,253
and, well, went crazy.

771
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:08,456
Dean Halsey?

772
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,198
Dean Halsey!

773
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,498
Arrest them!

774
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:12,375
I'm calling the police!

775
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,169
Oh, Daddy!

776
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,871
Shock... don't worry.

777
00:58:40,165 --> 00:58:42,560
Eat that.
We have work to do.

778
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:46,123
First of all, there are a few
decisions that we have to make.

779
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:50,269
Well, fortunately the police accepted
the explanation that Halsey went mad.

780
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,181
Well, what else
could they believe in?

781
00:58:52,182 --> 00:58:55,340
The truth?
That he died and came back?

782
00:58:55,341 --> 00:58:56,533
We did it Dan!

783
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,384
Did you see how he
reacted to his daughter?

784
00:58:58,385 --> 00:59:00,214
He recognised her.
He knew who she was.

785
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:03,539
And he knew what has happened
to him. He had conscious thought.

786
00:59:07,743 --> 00:59:08,679
So.

787
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,093
So we can stay here
in school... if we want.

788
00:59:12,094 --> 00:59:15,838
It is up to us Dan, what
our next move is going to be...

789
00:59:17,653 --> 00:59:19,896
Will we show up or not...?

790
01:00:03,209 --> 01:00:04,430
Damn!

791
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:07,491
It was the hypo...

792
01:00:07,892 --> 01:00:09,392
God, hurt by your action...

793
01:00:09,393 --> 01:00:11,537
No, no it's just a weak solution.

794
01:00:11,638 --> 01:00:15,729
So I don't have to sleep
just to keep the brain... sharp.

795
01:00:16,271 --> 01:00:19,021
- No.
- Yes. Yeah, I need it.

796
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:20,116
Please.

797
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:28,518
- How much?
- Eight cc's.

798
01:00:49,298 --> 01:00:52,302
- Oh, give it to me.
- Here.

799
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:14,022
Now... we must make our plans.

800
01:01:33,027 --> 01:01:36,489
Daddy.

801
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:39,033
He can't hear you, or see you.

802
01:01:39,117 --> 01:01:43,745
That's a one-way mirror.

803
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:47,835
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

804
01:01:47,918 --> 01:01:49,202
Will he ever be...

805
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:51,756
Until we know exactly what
happened to him,

806
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:57,597
there's no way to determine
his course of recovery.

807
01:01:57,638 --> 01:02:00,389
That's why I need you
to sign a release,

808
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:04,601
so that I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

809
01:02:04,643 --> 01:02:07,606
Is that absolutely necessary,
Dr. Hill?

810
01:02:07,647 --> 01:02:12,318
I know how difficult
this must be for you,

811
01:02:12,401 --> 01:02:17,617
but I'm convinced that your father's
problem is neurological.

812
01:02:17,657 --> 01:02:20,868
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

813
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:27,791
You must trust me.

814
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:42,849
I want to take a look at the
right frontal lobe.

815
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:44,811
I'll open the skull here...

816
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:47,813
I don't want to know.

817
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:51,149
Just help him.

818
01:03:12,047 --> 01:03:14,841
Please, doctor.

819
01:03:14,926 --> 01:03:17,928
Please let me talk to him.

820
01:03:18,012 --> 01:03:20,597
No.

821
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:24,893
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

822
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:32,222
And I insist you call me Carl.

823
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:42,804
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

824
01:03:45,996 --> 01:03:49,316
Or if you're ever lonely.

825
01:03:52,924 --> 01:03:56,780
I know you're all by yourself now.

826
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:07,938
I'm going to take care
of him, doctor,

827
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:11,464
and I'm going to find out
what happened to him.

828
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:43,879
First and second lumbar
vertebrae are crushed.

829
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:48,031
Dorsal ganglia is torn.

830
01:04:49,705 --> 01:04:53,541
Inferior cervical ganglia is torn

831
01:04:55,874 --> 01:04:58,566
The neck is broken.

832
01:05:04,324 --> 01:05:08,872
Dean Halsey is clearly dead.

833
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:22,440
Patient's brain wave is erratic...
disconnected.

834
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:27,903
I've never seen anything like it.

835
01:05:34,326 --> 01:05:37,790
The patient though apparently dead...

836
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,767
must be made docile...

837
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:45,283
so that he can be
studied more closely.

838
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:04,552
What are you doing here?

839
01:06:04,636 --> 01:06:07,138
I've been waiting for you.

840
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:11,309
I have to tell you.

841
01:06:11,393 --> 01:06:15,733
What did you do to him?

842
01:06:15,815 --> 01:06:20,360
What did you and West do
to him to make him like that?

843
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,825
It was... it was horrible.

844
01:06:24,864 --> 01:06:28,410
I didn't...

845
01:06:28,494 --> 01:06:30,872
What did you do to him?

846
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,507
He's not insane.

847
01:06:44,009 --> 01:06:47,012
He's dead.

848
01:06:47,095 --> 01:06:51,392
No. No.

849
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:54,779
You're insane,
you are insane, no!

850
01:06:54,863 --> 01:06:57,022
You know it's true, Meg.

851
01:06:57,106 --> 01:06:58,651
You know it's true.

852
01:06:58,734 --> 01:07:01,862
No.

853
01:07:05,281 --> 01:07:10,871
Daddy. Daddy.

854
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:17,880
I'll tell you, Meg, everything.

855
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:32,644
Good evening, Mr. West.

856
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:39,651
What do you want?

857
01:07:39,735 --> 01:07:42,737
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrillated.

858
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,155
I don't have to talk to you.

859
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:45,807
Why his pulse is erratic.

860
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,874
I've told everything I know
to the police.

861
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:50,112
Why he cries out in pain.

862
01:07:50,194 --> 01:07:51,814
You can leave now, doctor.

863
01:07:51,856 --> 01:07:56,709
When we both know
he is quite dead.

864
01:08:03,174 --> 01:08:06,926
Interesting little laboratory
you have here.

865
01:08:06,968 --> 01:08:12,310
Mr. West, I recognize this?

866
01:08:14,561 --> 01:08:16,480
What do you want?

867
01:08:16,562 --> 01:08:20,691
Yes, we are both scientists.

868
01:08:20,775 --> 01:08:23,738
Let us get to the point.

869
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,953
I want your discovery.

870
01:08:31,036 --> 01:08:34,631
Whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

871
01:08:34,656 --> 01:08:37,025
Oh, it is not the appearance
of life, it is life.

872
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:41,365
This is not magic, as you say,
I am a scientist.

873
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:45,051
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

874
01:08:45,133 --> 01:08:47,219
or a murderer.

875
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:52,510
You will do...

876
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:55,110
what I tell you to do.

877
01:08:56,889 --> 01:08:59,059
Yes, doc.

878
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,388
I want to see your notes.

879
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:32,332
Ingenious, Mr. West.

880
01:09:32,415 --> 01:09:37,680
Your extension of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

881
01:09:37,763 --> 01:09:38,808
brilliant.

882
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:47,059
You... will be my assistant.

883
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,693
We will work very closely together.

884
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:57,939
And in a year or so...

885
01:09:59,715 --> 01:10:02,983
I will reveal to an astonished world...

886
01:10:02,984 --> 01:10:06,219
my new serum.

887
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:09,840
They will retire the
Nobel Prize in my name.

888
01:10:09,941 --> 01:10:13,922
And you... as my assistant,
will be famous.

889
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:19,337
That leaves only Cain.

890
01:10:20,636 --> 01:10:23,483
He will disappear.

891
01:10:26,827 --> 01:10:30,651
Oh, yes.

892
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:37,090
I think West believes
we'll really get away with it.

893
01:10:37,091 --> 01:10:40,329
Oh, cause I don't.
I don't know.

894
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:45,943
I think he's only
excited by the experiment.

895
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:51,247
We tried to save it.

896
01:10:52,839 --> 01:10:54,769
West killed it.

897
01:10:57,275 --> 01:10:58,289
***

898
01:10:59,598 --> 01:11:01,104
The corpse.

899
01:11:02,646 --> 01:11:04,942
West killed the corpse.

900
01:11:04,943 --> 01:11:06,622
How silly that sounds.

901
01:11:06,823 --> 01:11:09,669
I'll go to the police, Meg.
I've got to have proof.

902
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,843
I'll turn myself in, but I
got to see your father first.

903
01:11:15,547 --> 01:11:17,208
He's dead.

904
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:23,726
I have to prove it.

905
01:11:43,877 --> 01:11:45,771
Has Dr. Hill examined
your father?

906
01:11:45,855 --> 01:11:47,148
Yes.

907
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:50,860
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

908
01:11:50,985 --> 01:11:53,196
Oh, shit.

909
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,408
Then he'll find out.

910
01:11:56,491 --> 01:11:59,660
Eventually he'll find out.

911
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,705
Let us see...

912
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:05,869
my new serum at work?

913
01:12:08,928 --> 01:12:10,845
Dead cat tissue.

914
01:12:15,812 --> 01:12:19,857
Reagent.

915
01:12:42,885 --> 01:12:45,098
Magnificent.

916
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:06,498
Yes, Mr. West.

917
01:13:06,584 --> 01:13:11,043
I will be famous.

918
01:13:22,015 --> 01:13:24,518
Laid to rest.

919
01:14:10,365 --> 01:14:13,200
Yes.

920
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:19,711
Parts.

921
01:14:19,795 --> 01:14:24,965
I've never done whole parts.

922
01:15:14,525 --> 01:15:19,280
Wesssssst

923
01:15:22,448 --> 01:15:24,538
Yes, doctor.

924
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:27,205
It's Herbert West.

925
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:28,456
What are you thinking?

926
01:15:28,539 --> 01:15:32,462
How do you feel?

927
01:15:32,546 --> 01:15:36,051
Yooooooou.

928
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:37,217
" You."

929
01:15:37,301 --> 01:15:43,056
Baaassstaaard

930
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,922
Dan!

931
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:24,217
Oh my god, what has Hill
done to him?

932
01:17:29,432 --> 01:17:33,730
Looks like a laser drill.

933
01:17:33,812 --> 01:17:35,442
Your father's been lobotomized.

934
01:18:20,993 --> 01:18:24,248
That's it.

935
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:27,500
My work! My work!

936
01:18:27,584 --> 01:18:28,543
What's going on?

937
01:18:28,628 --> 01:18:31,381
My work is gone.

938
01:18:31,465 --> 01:18:33,224
It's all gone.

939
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,012
He took my serum!

940
01:18:35,095 --> 01:18:36,429
Except for what
I have upstairs.

941
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:37,931
Who?

942
01:18:38,014 --> 01:18:39,349
What happened here?

943
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:40,808
Hill.

944
01:18:40,892 --> 01:18:43,853
Hill took my serum!
My notes! Everything.

945
01:18:43,938 --> 01:18:44,939
Herbert, you're insane!

946
01:18:45,021 --> 01:18:47,191
- Now, what happened here?
- I had to kill him.

947
01:18:47,276 --> 01:18:49,444
What?

948
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:53,282
He's dead?

949
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:57,578
- Not any more.
- No, Herbert.

950
01:18:57,662 --> 01:18:58,829
This has gotta stop!

951
01:18:58,913 --> 01:19:00,457
Look, he tried
to blackmail me, Dan.

952
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:01,461
Enough is enough!

953
01:19:01,542 --> 01:19:03,169
And he wanted you to disappear!

954
01:19:13,557 --> 01:19:17,311
Oh. Oh.

955
01:19:17,392 --> 01:19:19,022
Oh, that's why he did
it to Halsey.

956
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:20,356
What? You've seen Halsey?

957
01:19:20,441 --> 01:19:23,608
He lobotomized him, so he could
control him in case

958
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,946
he ever tried to talk or tell
somebody what happened.

959
01:19:26,031 --> 01:19:28,326
<i>So he could protect his discovery.</i>

960
01:19:28,368 --> 01:19:30,076
- Yes.
- Very clever.

961
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,703
I gotta tell Meg.

962
01:19:31,786 --> 01:19:33,660
What does Meg
have to do with this?

963
01:19:33,745 --> 01:19:35,081
Hill's got this weird file on her,

964
01:19:35,166 --> 01:19:37,668
it's full of napkins and hair
and photographs.

965
01:19:37,753 --> 01:19:41,171
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need onto her.

966
01:19:46,834 --> 01:19:48,745
I think you're sick as he is.

967
01:19:48,746 --> 01:19:50,490
Oh, I don't think so.

968
01:19:50,891 --> 01:19:52,202
So, what do we do now?

969
01:19:52,203 --> 01:19:56,016
Well, we're the only
ones to know the truth.

970
01:19:56,065 --> 01:20:00,914
Yes?
So, he'll have to come to us.

971
01:20:02,161 --> 01:20:04,216
You mean, after us.

972
01:21:35,776 --> 01:21:39,099
Ah, yes...

973
01:21:56,656 --> 01:21:58,118
Are you sure you're coming?

974
01:21:58,119 --> 01:21:59,319
Y-y-yes.

975
01:22:00,085 --> 01:22:03,297
Because if what you told me is true, we
can hardly just walk down the street.

976
01:22:03,298 --> 01:22:06,816
Perhaps not him but
somebody, some thing will.

977
01:22:07,217 --> 01:22:10,325
- Oh is it?
- I told you I have a plan.

978
01:22:13,366 --> 01:22:16,830
- So do I.
- Oh, no damn. He spoke words.

979
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:20,800
Speech patterns. The muscle control.
You did what do you feel?

980
01:22:20,843 --> 01:22:22,043
Do it!

981
01:22:23,392 --> 01:22:26,386
Alan...

982
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:39,026
I still don't understand
why he'd come here.

983
01:22:39,027 --> 01:22:40,953
Because he wants the credit.

984
01:22:41,154 --> 01:22:42,692
Both of them.

985
01:22:42,693 --> 01:22:44,654
No, don't you understand?

986
01:22:44,655 --> 01:22:49,283
We stand between him
and his obsessive desire.

987
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:53,767
You know, besides he hates it.

988
01:22:54,593 --> 01:22:55,778
He's jealous.

989
01:22:57,444 --> 01:23:00,254
- Meg!
- Oh, come on.

990
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:03,563
Don't you see? It's not
us he wants. It's her.

991
01:23:03,864 --> 01:23:05,443
I got to go!

992
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:39,556
Is that you, Dr. Hill?

993
01:23:39,637 --> 01:23:40,899
Yes, it's me.

994
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,768
Break time.

995
01:24:23,386 --> 01:24:27,546
That's... better.

996
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:18,270
Meg? Meg!

997
01:25:18,271 --> 01:25:21,284
Dan? Dan...

998
01:25:21,429 --> 01:25:24,932
- I was so afraid.
- What is it?

999
01:25:25,015 --> 01:25:27,018
What's the matter?

1000
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:31,271
Well... I don't know.

1001
01:25:31,355 --> 01:25:33,398
I was just worried about you.

1002
01:25:34,899 --> 01:25:37,154
Why?

1003
01:25:37,236 --> 01:25:41,950
I... I just feel horrible
about everything.

1004
01:25:44,991 --> 01:25:47,162
I guess I'm just getting paranoid.

1005
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:53,250
It's just...

1006
01:25:53,336 --> 01:25:54,920
so hard to lose you.

1007
01:25:57,586 --> 01:26:00,007
You should go away.

1008
01:26:02,385 --> 01:26:05,264
Transfer to another school.

1009
01:26:05,348 --> 01:26:07,350
Don't worry about me.

1010
01:26:10,099 --> 01:26:12,311
You're the one
that should get away.

1011
01:26:15,234 --> 01:26:16,276
Go live your life.

1012
01:26:20,364 --> 01:26:23,113
Find somebody.

1013
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:25,242
I tried to hate you.

1014
01:26:28,662 --> 01:26:31,498
I wanted so much to hate you.

1015
01:26:36,836 --> 01:26:39,004
I love you.

1016
01:26:41,218 --> 01:26:42,805
No! Daddy!

1017
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:47,222
Dr. Halsey.

1018
01:26:47,306 --> 01:26:49,140
No, Daddy!

1019
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,357
Oh, no, Daddy!

1020
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,732
Daddy! Daddy!

1021
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:13,748
The door.

1022
01:27:55,291 --> 01:27:57,917
Oh... yes.

1023
01:28:44,591 --> 01:28:49,095
Dan? Dan?

1024
01:28:49,177 --> 01:28:51,264
Dan?

1025
01:28:51,347 --> 01:28:54,101
Come on.

1026
01:28:56,559 --> 01:28:58,645
Oh, well, you'll be all right.

1027
01:28:59,129 --> 01:29:00,905
Meg!

1028
01:29:01,188 --> 01:29:02,399
Oh my god.

1029
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:03,904
Where, Herbert?

1030
01:29:03,986 --> 01:29:06,778
He's at the hospital I imagine.
Can you stand up?

1031
01:29:06,862 --> 01:29:08,113
Let's go.

1032
01:29:14,036 --> 01:29:16,037
Oh... Meg.

1033
01:29:58,164 --> 01:30:00,874
I've... always...

1034
01:30:01,875 --> 01:30:05,461
admired your beauty, my dear.

1035
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:12,217
I think I've always loved you.

1036
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:23,315
You will love me.

1037
01:30:30,278 --> 01:30:32,113
You will.

1038
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:36,410
Please!

1039
01:30:36,495 --> 01:30:38,496
Please stop!

1040
01:30:38,578 --> 01:30:40,206
Let me go!

1041
01:30:40,246 --> 01:30:43,708
That's it, my dearest Meg...

1042
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:46,462
more passion!

1043
01:30:49,589 --> 01:30:54,219
- Oh my god!
- Yes, my love!

1044
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:57,226
I must say, Dr. Hill...

1045
01:30:57,308 --> 01:31:00,975
I'm very disappointed in you.

1046
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:03,761
You steal the secret
of life and death,

1047
01:31:03,846 --> 01:31:06,897
and here you are trysting
with the bubble-headed coed,

1048
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:09,776
you're not even
a second-rate scientist.

1049
01:31:09,861 --> 01:31:13,111
Mr. West.

1050
01:31:13,241 --> 01:31:16,366
I'm actually glad to see you.

1051
01:31:17,868 --> 01:31:22,873
It saves me the trouble
of having to send for you.

1052
01:31:22,957 --> 01:31:25,252
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

1053
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:27,160
Who's gonna believe
a talking head?

1054
01:31:27,243 --> 01:31:28,836
Get a job in a sideshow.

1055
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:31,257
I wonder why

1056
01:31:31,342 --> 01:31:35,718
an intelligent young man like yourself

1057
01:31:37,472 --> 01:31:42,185
should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake,

1058
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:46,147
of coming here to challenge me.

1059
01:31:47,146 --> 01:31:50,318
Oh... I have a plan.

1060
01:31:50,402 --> 01:31:54,573
So do I.

1061
01:32:11,630 --> 01:32:13,549
Let go of me!

1062
01:32:33,652 --> 01:32:34,821
Enough!

1063
01:32:48,666 --> 01:32:52,669
I will show you power, Mr. West!

1064
01:32:52,754 --> 01:32:54,884
My discovery,

1065
01:32:54,966 --> 01:32:57,803
a laser surgical drill.

1066
01:32:57,885 --> 01:33:01,971
It makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy,

1067
01:33:02,973 --> 01:33:07,019
which results in total mastery

1068
01:33:07,101 --> 01:33:09,190
of the human will.

1069
01:33:09,272 --> 01:33:12,273
Re-animated subjects

1070
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:15,486
have proven to be the best.

1071
01:33:15,572 --> 01:33:19,364
They will give me power!

1072
01:33:19,448 --> 01:33:22,702
Undreamed of power.

1073
01:33:25,205 --> 01:33:27,082
Stay behind me.

1074
01:33:31,628 --> 01:33:32,794
Daddy, listen to me.

1075
01:33:32,877 --> 01:33:35,131
It's Megan, Megan!

1076
01:33:35,213 --> 01:33:39,135
- Hill, they'll kill her!
- Then I'll give her life!

1077
01:33:41,135 --> 01:33:43,515
Look at me!

1078
01:34:46,702 --> 01:34:47,787
Meg, come on!

1079
01:34:47,871 --> 01:34:49,624
Let's go! Come on!

1080
01:34:49,707 --> 01:34:50,623
Wait!

1081
01:34:50,707 --> 01:34:52,374
I am not through here!

1082
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:54,791
Megan, no!

1083
01:34:54,875 --> 01:34:58,340
- Let me go!
- I told you, I have a theory!

1084
01:34:58,465 --> 01:35:00,674
- Overdose!
- No!

1085
01:35:53,185 --> 01:35:56,607
Herbert!

1086
01:36:14,874 --> 01:36:17,794
Look out!

1087
01:36:24,593 --> 01:36:27,343
Daddy!

1088
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:37,813
My notes.

1089
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:41,819
My notes!

1090
01:36:45,155 --> 01:36:47,197
Let's go.

1091
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:06,352
Stop it!

1092
01:37:15,601 --> 01:37:17,605
Come on!

1093
01:38:27,925 --> 01:38:29,052
My God! Megan!

1094
01:38:29,132 --> 01:38:30,091
Take her into number three!

1095
01:38:30,175 --> 01:38:32,553
Bring her this way!

1096
01:38:37,292 --> 01:38:39,346
Hurry, hurry,
she's got nothing.

1097
01:38:39,936 --> 01:38:42,522
Activating.

1098
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:43,733
Air on.

1099
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,489
Somebody give me some paste!

1100
01:38:52,573 --> 01:38:53,784
On three.

1101
01:38:56,285 --> 01:38:57,285
Okay, everybody off.

1102
01:38:57,369 --> 01:39:00,248
Clear.

1103
01:39:03,627 --> 01:39:05,294
Nothing.

1104
01:39:06,294 --> 01:39:07,879
Bringing back air.

1105
01:39:10,842 --> 01:39:12,718
The trachea's fractured.

1106
01:39:12,758 --> 01:39:14,095
She's fixed and dilated.

1107
01:39:14,177 --> 01:39:16,639
No response.

1108
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:25,460
Cain... Cain.

1109
01:41:04,163 --> 01:41:05,832
I love you.

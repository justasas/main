1
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,825
Dr. Gruber!

2
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:39,165
<i>Doctor!</i>

3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,416
<i>Mr. West!</i>

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,629
<i>Mr. West!</i>

5
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>Get out!</i>

6
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,053
<i>Move back.</i>

7
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,903
My god.

8
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,326
You idiots!
You'll ruin my notes.

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,828
I have to record
his vital signs!

10
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,205
No! No!

11
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:22,625
Dr. Gruber?

12
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:25,336
<i>Dr. Gruber, How this happened?</i>

13
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,675
Dr. Gruber?

14
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>He's dead.</i>

15
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:53,364
Of course, he's dead,
the dosage was too large.

16
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,323
You killed him.

17
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,826
No, I did not.

18
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,621
I gave him life.

19
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,336
All right,
I'm gonna zap her again.

20
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,172
Charge up the paddles.

21
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:58,215
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

22
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,134
Sorry, doctor.

23
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,178
Hold the compressions.

24
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,139
Clear!

25
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,978
Straight line.

26
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,858
All right, let's call it.

27
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,775
Cain.

28
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,987
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

29
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,697
Cain, we have done everything

30
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,741
that can be done for this woman.

31
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,701
She has not responded.

32
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,913
She's gone!

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,635
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

34
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,888
A good doctor
knows when to stop.

35
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,889
- Dr. Harrod, just...
- Take her.

36
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:50,100
And take her to the morgue.

37
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,938
Gangway...

38
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:06,533
Mr. Cain.

39
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,868
Hey, Mace!

40
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,203
I got another one for you.

41
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,289
They ain't locked.
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

42
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,541
Oh, thanks.

43
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,752
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here.

44
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,254
Nobody wants in...

45
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,006
and ain't nobody gettin' out.

46
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,884
Yup.

47
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,124
Full house.

48
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,181
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't mean to scare you.

49
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,348
Oh, it wasn't too bad
Dean Halsey.

50
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:55,100
I just didn't know anybody was here.

51
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,144
You mean, "anybody else".

52
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,645
Dan, this is Herbert West.

53
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,355
He'll be joining you
in your third year.

54
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,316
He was doing independent
research in Switzerland

55
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,193
with Dr. Gruber shortly before he died.

56
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,653
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain.

57
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,071
(One of Miskatonic Medical's

58
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:11,366
best young hopes
for the future of medicine.

59
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,784
What were you researching?

60
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,244
Death.

61
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,331
Alan, we don't see you
around here much anymore.

62
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, I was just showing
our newest student,

63
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
Herbert West here,
the not-so-grand tour.

64
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,295
This should interest you, Carl.

65
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:26,965
He worked with Hans Gruber.

66
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,675
Mr. West?

67
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,431
This is our eminent brain researcher
and grant machine, Dr. Carl Hill.

68
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,517
I know your work, Dr. Hill.

69
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,352
Quite well.

70
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,729
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

71
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,190
interesting...

72
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,735
though derivative of Dr. Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

73
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:50,113
So derivative, in fact, that in Europe
it's considered plagiarized.

74
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:54,076
And your support of the 12-minute limit on
the life of the brain stem after death...

75
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,079
Six to 12 minutes, Mr...

76
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,998
West. Herbert West.

77
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,168
Frankly, Dr. Hill?

78
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:05,587
Your work on brain death
is outdated.

79
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,801
Carl, while I remember,

80
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,387
we're having a grant committee
meeting Thursday.

81
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,014
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

82
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,307
Well, I'd love to, Alan,

83
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,393
looking forward to it.

84
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:23,146
And looking forward to
seeing you in class, Mr. West.

85
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,791
Hi.

86
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,379
No. No.

87
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,594
Yes! Oh, yes!

88
00:13:00,343 --> 00:13:02,929
Rufus!

89
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:05,139
Thanks a lot, buddy.

90
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,225
I have to go.

91
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,104
No, stay.

92
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:13,689
Daddy knows I'm here.

93
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,525
I don't care
what Dean Halsey knows.

94
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:25,193
Be reasonable.

95
00:13:25,277 --> 00:13:27,446
If I didn't come home
one night...

96
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,197
just one night...

97
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:31,199
What would he do?

98
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:32,951
Expel me?

99
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,703
He's out of touch with the times.

100
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,455
That's just the way he is,

101
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,999
the world's last living Puritan.

102
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,046
I really hate it.

103
00:14:36,818 --> 00:14:38,445
The day that you graduate,

104
00:14:38,528 --> 00:14:42,115
the minute you get your M.D.,
I'll marry you,

105
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,827
and I'll help you, and I'll be with you

106
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,580
as much as I can until then.

107
00:14:48,664 --> 00:14:51,958
I promise.

108
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:54,294
Back to square one.

109
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:57,881
Well, at least it gives me
a chance to housebreak you.

110
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,802
Housebroken, is it?

111
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:10,977
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, my girl.

112
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:13,021
What are you doing?

113
00:15:13,105 --> 00:15:16,858
Dan.

114
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:19,986
Dan... stop, don't.

115
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,614
Dan, stop it!

116
00:15:22,698 --> 00:15:23,865
Come, my pretty.

117
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,618
Dan, I don't like that.

118
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:30,872
There's not a jury in the world
that would convict me.

119
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:32,624
Dan, stop it!

120
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,626
Doctor Dan!

121
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,879
Dan, don't, come on, stop.

122
00:15:37,963 --> 00:15:39,047
I really have to go.

123
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:40,590
Come here! Come to me.

124
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,718
- Oh.
- What?

125
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,805
Oh, shit.

126
00:15:46,888 --> 00:15:48,056
Hi.

127
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,559
Can I help you?

128
00:15:50,642 --> 00:15:52,144
You're
here about the apartment.

129
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:54,604
Yes.

130
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,815
Didn't we meet this morning?
You're...

131
00:15:56,898 --> 00:15:58,775
West. Herbert West.

132
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,361
Excuse me just one sec.

133
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:05,574
Come in.

134
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,868
Thank you.

135
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,541
I startled you.

136
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,752
Yes, you did.

137
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:22,215
May I introduce my fiancÃ©e,
Megan Halsey?

138
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:25,469
- Miss Halsey.
- Mr. West.

139
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:27,763
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr. West.

140
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:30,140
Oh... Herbert.

141
00:16:41,026 --> 00:16:43,695
So, you've
just come from Europe?

142
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:46,198
Switzerland.

143
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:48,617
What was Dr. Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

144
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,243
Yes, pretty famous...

145
00:16:50,327 --> 00:16:52,871
Does this building
have a basement?

146
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:59,377
Oh, yes.

147
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,300
Yes.

148
00:17:05,383 --> 00:17:08,178
I think this will be just fine.

149
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,597
I have my things outside,
shall I move in now?

150
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,725
Look, I have to go.

151
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,936
I think you and Mr. West
have a lot to discuss

152
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,354
before you decide anything.

153
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:20,440
Oh, I've decided.

154
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:21,733
Well, I'd like-â€”

155
00:17:21,817 --> 00:17:23,819
You know, you'll never even
know that I'm here.

156
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:24,736
Dan, I...

157
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,987
Except, of course,
on the first of the month.

158
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,614
Mr. West?

159
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:28,990
Miss Halsey?

160
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:32,994
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

161
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:37,082
There was no more
I could learn there.

162
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:42,921
Do we... have a deal?

163
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:50,011
Done.

164
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,765
Done.

165
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,061
You make the incision
at the base of the skull...

166
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:14,536
cutting away
enough of the faschia...

167
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,457
to get your fingers in...

168
00:18:22,711 --> 00:18:26,715
and then grasping firmly
with both hands,

169
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,887
you pull the skin forward
over the head,

170
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,974
very much like peeling
a large orange.

171
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:43,440
Once the skull is plainly visible,

172
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,651
you take the bone saw...

173
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,905
And you cut around the perimeter.

174
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:06,421
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

175
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:08,798
the human brain.

176
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,593
Once the brain stem
of an individual,

177
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,679
I'm talking about the reticular
activating system,

178
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:17,307
heart regulation,
respiratory center.

179
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,851
Once these activities cease,

180
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:25,231
the brain can only survive
an additional six to 12 minutes.

181
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:28,193
Six to 12 minutes.

182
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:33,239
Until...

183
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:37,869
brain death brings about
an irreversible conclusion.

184
00:19:46,544 --> 00:19:50,548
We all want to retain
our personalities

185
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,801
in some idyllic afterlife.

186
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:55,720
We all pray for some miracle,

187
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:59,432
some drug, potion, pill.

188
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:10,151
Perhaps, though,
it takes something else.

189
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:14,698
Perhaps it takes desire,
an obsessive desire.

190
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:17,200
Perhaps it ta...

191
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:26,876
We will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure

192
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:30,296
at another time.

193
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,465
Mr. West!

194
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,885
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

195
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,139
Class dismissed.

196
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,226
How can you teach such drivel?

197
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,270
These people are here to learn
and you're closing their minds

198
00:20:45,353 --> 00:20:46,521
before they even have a chance!

199
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,023
What are you here for,
Mr. West?

200
00:20:48,064 --> 00:20:50,025
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas,

201
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:51,443
then at least you'd have ideas!

202
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,528
Mr. West!

203
00:20:56,281 --> 00:20:59,159
It is going to be
a pleasure to fail you.

204
00:21:06,374 --> 00:21:10,378
I would like to propose a toast

205
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:12,589
to the National Science Foundation

206
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:16,926
for recognizing the genius
of Dr. Carl Hill,

207
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:21,056
and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

208
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:22,682
its largest grant ever.

209
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:28,229
Your new laser drill is going
to revolutionize neurosurgery.

210
00:21:28,313 --> 00:21:32,942
To the foundation,
and to Miskatonic.

211
00:21:36,321 --> 00:21:37,864
It's all right, sweetheart,
you can drink up.

212
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:38,990
We're celebrating.

213
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,159
I know, Daddy,
but I have to go soon.

214
00:21:41,242 --> 00:21:44,954
After preparing such a feast,
you must be tired.

215
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,706
I have a study date.

216
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,166
With Daniel?

217
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,834
Yeah.

218
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,169
Daniel Cain'?

219
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,632
Herbert West has moved in
with him, hasn't he?

220
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:57,383
For the time being.

221
00:21:58,468 --> 00:22:00,345
That must be him Excuse me.

222
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:07,435
So, your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

223
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,273
You think that's wise, Alan'?

224
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,483
Dan!

225
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,235
Hello, sir.

226
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:16,945
Dr. Hill.

227
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:18,988
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

228
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:22,742
Actually, we have some
work to do.

229
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,285
Why don't you study here?

230
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:27,789
Well, I've her home soon,
don't worry.

231
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:32,127
Well then, one last toast?

232
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:35,547
To Megan...

233
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,676
my esteemed colleague's capable,

234
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,263
beautiful, loving daughter,

235
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:46,474
the obsession of all
who fall under her spell.

236
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:04,325
Dan.

237
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:06,870
No.

238
00:27:36,953 --> 00:27:39,664
Please!

239
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:40,832
Okay, what is it?

240
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:42,792
I don't know, it's...

241
00:27:42,876 --> 00:27:46,045
Look, it's not you, really.

242
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,298
It's just a lot of little things.

243
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:50,049
Like what?

244
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:52,719
Well, West is always in his room
with the door closed.

245
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:54,762
I mean, do you ever see him?

246
00:27:54,846 --> 00:27:56,347
Does he ever eat?

247
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,975
I told you, he's a little cracked.

248
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,646
He bothers you, too.

249
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,857
No, don't be ridiculous.

250
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,525
Rufus is terrified of him.

251
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,068
When West comes in,
he runs and hides.

252
00:28:09,194 --> 00:28:10,987
Rufus hides
and runs all the time,

253
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,363
it's standard cat activity.

254
00:28:12,447 --> 00:28:13,448
Yes, but not when we're together,

255
00:28:13,531 --> 00:28:15,491
then he's all over us trying
to get your attention and...

256
00:28:16,993 --> 00:28:18,578
Where is he?

257
00:28:18,661 --> 00:28:20,079
I haven't seen him
since we got here.

258
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:21,372
It's okay, he's around here.

259
00:28:21,456 --> 00:28:22,457
I haven't even heard him,

260
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,210
usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

261
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:29,756
Pss pss pss pss.

262
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:34,260
Rufus... Rufus... Rufus.

263
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,470
Pss pss pss pss.

264
00:28:35,553 --> 00:28:39,057
Come on, you fat cat.

265
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,600
Here, kitty!

266
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,393
Rufus.

267
00:28:42,477 --> 00:28:44,812
Come on now, you mad animal.

268
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,856
Don't you try to hide from me.

269
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,400
I know all of your tricks.

270
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:52,403
Rufus? Where are you, boy?

271
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:54,405
Here, kitty.

272
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,532
Here, kitty!

273
00:28:58,243 --> 00:28:59,577
Here, kitty.

274
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:08,503
Rufus. Hey, boy!

275
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:22,725
Rufus?

276
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:29,023
Rufus?

277
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:32,819
Rufus.

278
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:41,494
Rufus?

279
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:50,420
Hey, boy.

280
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,637
Rufus, are you in here?

281
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:07,520
Here, boy.

282
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:09,564
Here, kitty.

283
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:25,538
Rufus?

284
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:33,129
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

285
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,839
What are you doing in my room?

286
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:36,341
- How dare you come in...
- Dan!

287
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:40,261
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

288
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,889
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

289
00:30:42,972 --> 00:30:44,140
Meg, what the hell
are you doing in here?

290
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:46,100
- I...
- Would you please leave, now!

291
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:48,353
Easy!

292
00:30:48,436 --> 00:30:49,645
In the fridge.

293
00:30:59,947 --> 00:31:01,699
I was going to show you.

294
00:31:01,783 --> 00:31:03,785
Shut up.

295
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,541
What happened?

296
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:13,669
It was dead when I found it.

297
00:31:13,753 --> 00:31:15,755
You killed him.

298
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:17,548
He hated you!

299
00:31:17,632 --> 00:31:20,426
Meg. It suffocated.

300
00:31:23,846 --> 00:31:27,558
It knocked the garbage over and
it got its head stuck in a jar.

301
00:31:27,642 --> 00:31:29,560
You weren't home,
so I put it in there.

302
00:31:29,644 --> 00:31:31,270
I certainly didn't think
you'd want to find it like that.

303
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:33,189
I didn't want
to stink the place up.

304
00:31:33,272 --> 00:31:35,233
I was going to show you.

305
00:31:35,316 --> 00:31:36,901
You couldn't call, or write a note?

306
00:31:36,984 --> 00:31:39,028
I was busy pushing bodies around,
as you well know,

307
00:31:39,112 --> 00:31:40,405
and what would a note say, Dan?

308
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:42,907
"Cat dead, details later"?

309
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,033
I knew you were fond of it.

310
00:31:44,117 --> 00:31:45,284
You killed him, I know you did.

311
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,285
He killed him.

312
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:47,912
Besides, I do not
like people in my room!

313
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:50,665
All right, that's enough.

314
00:31:57,588 --> 00:31:59,257
I think you both better leave, now.

315
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,341
What the hell is this?

316
00:32:00,425 --> 00:32:01,551
That is none of your business.

317
00:32:01,634 --> 00:32:02,677
Yeah, I think it is my business!

318
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,803
Just as it is none of my business

319
00:32:03,886 --> 00:32:05,513
that you're sleeping
with Dean Halsey's daughter.

320
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:10,601
You know, I would not want
to see a fellow student,

321
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,437
especially one
as promising as yourself,

322
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:14,814
be thrown out of school,
out of the profession...

323
00:32:14,897 --> 00:32:18,443
on moral ground.

324
00:32:18,484 --> 00:32:20,570
I think Dr. Halsey
just might understand.

325
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:22,321
Oh, do you?

326
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:24,866
Well, you may well be right.

327
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:28,703
Are you sure you want
to find out?

328
00:33:54,923 --> 00:33:56,133
Herbert?

329
00:33:57,134 --> 00:33:58,302
Herbert.

330
00:33:58,343 --> 00:34:00,220
Herbert!

331
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,806
You hear that sound?

332
00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:05,517
West! West!

333
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,146
West, what is that?

334
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:33,045
Quiet!

335
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,091
Get off of...

336
00:34:38,175 --> 00:34:40,010
Cain!

337
00:34:43,096 --> 00:34:44,181
Get out of here!

338
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:50,520
Get it off of me!

339
00:34:58,111 --> 00:34:59,404
Stay away!

340
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,489
Later!

341
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:07,579
AW, shit.

342
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:10,624
There he is! Shit.

343
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:20,384
Don't move.

344
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,555
Look out!

345
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:28,141
There it goes under the stairs,
it's under the stairs.

346
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:39,611
Okay, I got it.

347
00:35:39,694 --> 00:35:41,738
I got it.

348
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:09,808
Oh.

349
00:36:09,891 --> 00:36:11,351
Look out!

350
00:36:37,149 --> 00:36:38,400
It's really quite simple.

351
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:41,319
All life is a physical
and chemical process, correct?

352
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:45,365
It stands to reason then, that if one
could find extremely fresh specimens

353
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:48,869
and recharge that chemical process,
bang, we have re-animation.

354
00:36:48,952 --> 00:36:53,540
- The theory is not new, West.
- But my reagent is.

355
00:36:53,623 --> 00:36:55,208
Read.

356
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:02,090
"With various animating solutions,"

357
00:37:02,174 --> 00:37:03,884
"I have killed and brought
to animated life,"

358
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:07,804
"a number of rabbits,
guinea pigs, cats, and dogs."

359
00:37:07,888 --> 00:37:10,056
I've broken the 6 to 12 minute barrier.

360
00:37:10,182 --> 00:37:12,017
I've conquered brain death.

361
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:16,479
"With the higher animals
and the consequent"

362
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:21,359
increased strength of solution,
reaction has become more violent...

363
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:24,529
and my research
has become more difficult.

364
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:27,949
Which is why
I need you to help me.

365
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:29,034
Help you?

366
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:31,369
You are the perfect person
to assist me.

367
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:34,372
You're hard-working, bright,
people respect you,

368
00:37:34,456 --> 00:37:39,044
and you have access
to certain authorities.

369
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:42,672
We can defeat death.

370
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:45,342
We can achieve
every doctor's dream.

371
00:37:45,425 --> 00:37:48,970
You'll be famous... and live lifetimes.

372
00:37:49,054 --> 00:37:52,432
You haven't done this on people?

373
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:59,105
I've done all I can here.

374
00:37:59,231 --> 00:38:02,442
I'll need new lab space.

375
00:38:02,525 --> 00:38:04,444
You will help me.

376
00:38:04,527 --> 00:38:07,155
- No!
- Why? Because it's mad?

377
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:08,865
No, because I don't
believe you.

378
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:10,867
How can you say that?
You've seen the results.

379
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:13,161
No, Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

380
00:38:13,245 --> 00:38:14,913
You drugged him
and reduced his vital signs.

381
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:16,122
You lowered his body temperature.

382
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:17,332
He couldn't have been dead.

383
00:38:17,415 --> 00:38:19,000
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

384
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,254
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

385
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:32,013
West, no!

386
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:37,727
West, stop!

387
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:39,854
I'll show you.

388
00:38:39,938 --> 00:38:41,648
- Then you'll help me.
- No!

389
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:42,857
Yes, you will.

390
00:38:42,941 --> 00:38:46,528
That is why I brought the infernal beast
back to life in the first place.

391
00:38:52,325 --> 00:38:54,160
- In the brain?
- Of course.

392
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:02,210
Don't expect it to tango,
it has a broken back.

393
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,469
God! Why does
it make that noise?

394
00:39:11,553 --> 00:39:14,139
Birth is always painful.

395
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,437
It was dead.

396
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,896
Twice.

397
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,485
- Oh, it's him!
- Baby, what are you doing here?

398
00:39:27,569 --> 00:39:29,321
It's Rufus! HOW did...

399
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,157
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Oh! Oh, my god.

400
00:40:47,356 --> 00:40:51,652
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue.

401
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:57,908
Mr. Cain, I'm surprised.

402
00:40:57,992 --> 00:40:58,993
No, I've seen it.

403
00:40:59,076 --> 00:41:02,997
He brought back a dead animal,
a cat, back to life.

404
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,083
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr. Cain,

405
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:09,044
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr. West.

406
00:41:09,128 --> 00:41:12,673
I know he's unstable,
but I've seen the results,

407
00:41:12,757 --> 00:41:14,925
and so has your daughter.

408
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:17,094
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

409
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,513
She walked into an experiment.

410
00:41:19,597 --> 00:41:22,683
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?

411
00:41:22,767 --> 00:41:24,685
I never intended to involve her.

412
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,646
Tomorrow morning, you will
submit to me a written apology

413
00:41:27,772 --> 00:41:29,440
for this entire affair.

414
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:32,902
These experiments were clearly beyond
the scope of your legitimate studies.

415
00:41:32,985 --> 00:41:36,322
They've obviously interfered with
your ability to do your class work.

416
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:40,951
If any equipment from the hospital
or from the laboratories

417
00:41:41,035 --> 00:41:44,538
of Miskatonic University were involved
in any of this unauthorized activity,

418
00:41:44,622 --> 00:41:46,499
criminal charges
may be pressed.

419
00:41:46,582 --> 00:41:50,211
You will, in any case, have
your student loan rescinded.

420
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:55,299
My loan?

421
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:57,676
I won't be able to continue school.

422
00:41:57,802 --> 00:42:00,221
As for Mr. West,
he needs submit no apology.

423
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:03,682
You may tell him that he may
continue with his research

424
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,976
without the impediment
of an education.

425
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,854
As of now, he is no longer
a student of this university.

426
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:11,982
Sir, can we please just discuss this?

427
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:14,318
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

428
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:17,947
That will be all, Mr. Cain.

429
00:42:26,539 --> 00:42:28,457
Don't take this out on Meg.

430
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,001
She tried to stop me.

431
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:34,088
I said that will be all.

432
00:45:18,354 --> 00:45:20,773
- Oh, they keep on a comin', don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

433
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,077
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have you?

434
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,412
Yeah, one meatball
run over by a semi.

435
00:45:35,496 --> 00:45:36,872
Ew!

436
00:45:36,955 --> 00:45:39,249
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

437
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,877
I might go catch me
some coffee.

438
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,462
- Take your time.
- You got it.

439
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,431
Meatball?

440
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:56,392
Just put your shoes on.

441
00:46:09,321 --> 00:46:10,739
Oh, damn, if we get caught...

442
00:46:10,823 --> 00:46:12,741
Oh, well, what will they do?

443
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:14,576
Embalm us?

444
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:17,162
Let's go.

445
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:37,975
Burn victim.

446
00:46:42,563 --> 00:46:44,565
- Here's your meatball.
- Oh.

447
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,447
Shotgun wound to the head.

448
00:46:53,615 --> 00:46:55,617
Oh, god, he's rotten.

449
00:46:58,287 --> 00:47:00,456
- Malpractice.
- Shit.

450
00:47:01,665 --> 00:47:03,459
Let's go, we're not going
to find anything.

451
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,252
Wait. Wait!

452
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,926
Yes, I think you.

453
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:14,761
How long?

454
00:47:14,845 --> 00:47:17,181
He arrived early this evening.

455
00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:19,600
John Doe, apparently just dropped dead.

456
00:47:19,683 --> 00:47:22,478
No record of any damage.
It's almost perfect.

457
00:47:23,729 --> 00:47:25,189
Why "almost"?

458
00:47:25,272 --> 00:47:27,274
Could be heart damage.

459
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:28,358
Then let's just find another one.

460
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:30,486
No! We do not have time!

461
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:32,404
All we need tonight

462
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:34,907
is a specific, conscious reaction.

463
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:36,575
He's been dead for hours.

464
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,953
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness will justify proceeding.

465
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:44,583
Start the recorder.

466
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,669
Start the damn recorder!

467
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:52,925
Make the entry.

468
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,678
October...

469
00:47:56,762 --> 00:47:57,679
Tenth.

470
00:47:57,763 --> 00:47:58,805
Tenth.

471
00:47:58,889 --> 00:48:01,350
- Subject: Male.
- Age?

472
00:48:02,434 --> 00:48:05,604
Age, early twenties.

473
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:08,690
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

474
00:48:08,774 --> 00:48:12,402
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

475
00:48:14,738 --> 00:48:17,533
Apparent cause of death...

476
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,246
what?

477
00:48:22,329 --> 00:48:24,373
Heart failure.

478
00:48:24,456 --> 00:48:26,917
Heart failure.

479
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:32,339
Time, 10:33 PM.

480
00:48:32,422 --> 00:48:35,259
10:33 PM.

481
00:48:37,886 --> 00:48:39,888
15 cc's.

482
00:48:41,932 --> 00:48:44,393
15 cc's of reagent being administered.

483
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:54,695
He loves me,
we're getting married.

484
00:48:54,778 --> 00:48:57,656
He's mad! I've seen this happen
to medical students before.

485
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:59,157
Good ones!

486
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:02,494
Dr. Harrod, is Mr. Cain loose
in this hospital?

487
00:49:02,578 --> 00:49:04,496
In the morgue, I think, doctor.

488
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,499
I specifically told
Dr. Riley to suspend him,

489
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:10,502
and to take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

490
00:49:10,586 --> 00:49:14,006
Dr. Riley's been
in emergency surgery for four hours.

491
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:17,384
I haven't seen him.

492
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:18,760
Time elapsed.

493
00:49:22,598 --> 00:49:24,474
15 seconds.

494
00:49:26,768 --> 00:49:29,521
Something should
have happened by now.

495
00:49:40,616 --> 00:49:43,702
It's not working.

496
00:49:43,785 --> 00:49:44,786
Let's get out of here!

497
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:48,040
Obviously, the human dosage
factor is unknown.

498
00:49:48,123 --> 00:49:50,751
Increasing the dosage,
20 cc's of reagent.

499
00:49:50,834 --> 00:49:52,669
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

500
00:50:18,570 --> 00:50:19,821
Damn!

501
00:50:19,905 --> 00:50:22,908
Page Mr. Cain and have him report
to Level L security desk,

502
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:26,119
and make sure
that she stays right here.

503
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:28,664
You can't stop me! I followed you here,
and I'm gonna follow you

504
00:50:28,705 --> 00:50:29,831
- until you listen to me!
- Megan!

505
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:30,916
- I love him!
- You're my daughter,

506
00:50:30,999 --> 00:50:32,834
and you'll do as you're told!

507
00:50:32,918 --> 00:50:34,836
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

508
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,381
Mr. Cain will be up soon,
you can discuss it then.

509
00:50:37,464 --> 00:50:39,299
Don't blame him, Daddy!

510
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:42,386
We failed.

511
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:43,679
Come on, let's go!

512
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,263
I mean, someone
could be coming any minute!

513
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:48,767
He failed! Not I!

514
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,061
<i>Mr. Cain, Mr. Daniel Cain,</i>

515
00:50:51,144 --> 00:50:54,231
<i>please report
to the security desk, Level L</i>

516
00:50:55,232 --> 00:50:56,525
Oh, god.

517
00:50:56,608 --> 00:50:58,276
Cover him up.

518
00:50:59,403 --> 00:51:01,822
- Let's go!
- All right!

519
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:22,968
Grab him!

520
00:51:26,513 --> 00:51:28,181
Stop!

521
00:51:32,102 --> 00:51:33,478
It listened to me.

522
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:43,947
Cain?

523
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:47,784
Cain?

524
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:51,955
Cain, open up this door.

525
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:56,042
Help!

526
00:51:56,126 --> 00:51:57,461
Get help!

527
00:51:57,544 --> 00:52:00,380
Is West in there with you?

528
00:52:00,464 --> 00:52:01,631
You're in a lot of trouble,
both of you!

529
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,865
No!

530
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:36,041
Let go!

531
00:52:49,054 --> 00:52:50,806
Stop!

532
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,057
For god's sakes!

533
00:52:53,058 --> 00:52:56,144
Dan... look out.

534
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:29,010
Come on.

535
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:31,096
Find the recorder.

536
00:53:32,681 --> 00:53:35,642
- Herbert... no.
- Did you see him react?

537
00:53:35,725 --> 00:53:38,311
He listened to me.
It made a conscious act.

538
00:53:38,395 --> 00:53:41,314
He heard you as an animal would.

539
00:53:42,315 --> 00:53:44,401
Herbert, no, you can't be serious!

540
00:53:44,484 --> 00:53:45,944
Hell, you may be right.

541
00:53:46,027 --> 00:53:47,153
It'd probably been dead too long.

542
00:53:47,237 --> 00:53:49,865
It wasn't fresh enough!

543
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:52,868
We probably only revived the senses
and the instincts, so, come on!

544
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:55,036
Help me get him up.

545
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,204
Is he dead?

546
00:53:56,288 --> 00:53:58,623
Of course, will you
give me a hand here?

547
00:53:58,707 --> 00:54:01,167
Now, he interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

548
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:02,586
Granted, it was an accident.

549
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:05,046
But this is the freshest body
that we could come across

550
00:54:05,130 --> 00:54:06,298
save of killing one ourselves,

551
00:54:06,381 --> 00:54:08,717
and every moment that we spend
talking about it costs us results!

552
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,802
Now will you give me a hand?

553
00:54:12,762 --> 00:54:16,474
Dan, we can bring him back to life.

554
00:54:30,113 --> 00:54:31,698
Okay.

555
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:41,666
Now, get the recorder.

556
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:44,628
Find my serum.

557
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,216
This is a dream.

558
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,385
Fiction.

559
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:55,180
Here. Do his other hand.

560
00:54:57,307 --> 00:54:59,851
Oh, good.

561
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:05,732
Unbreakable plastic, one of
man's few durable inventions.

562
00:55:07,817 --> 00:55:09,819
Certainly more durable than this.

563
00:55:10,946 --> 00:55:14,741
We need you in the crash room.

564
00:55:14,824 --> 00:55:16,701
Coming.

565
00:55:45,522 --> 00:55:47,565
12 cc's being administered.

566
00:55:47,649 --> 00:55:52,237
The dosage lessened in accordance
to the freshness of the subject.

567
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:11,715
5 seconds.

568
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:14,050
Come on.

569
00:56:14,134 --> 00:56:17,846
I'll show you.

570
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:22,017
15 seconds. I'll show you!

571
00:56:22,058 --> 00:56:23,560
17 seconds.

572
00:56:23,643 --> 00:56:26,062
Re-animation at 17 seconds!
The eyes opened!

573
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,356
Doctor. Dr. Halsey,

574
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,027
you once did me a favor by
letting me into your medical school.

575
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:33,194
Doctor?

576
00:56:33,278 --> 00:56:35,030
Welcome back to life.

577
00:56:58,344 --> 00:57:00,221
Daddy?

578
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:01,931
Dan?

579
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:03,475
Damn the bitch.

580
00:57:03,558 --> 00:57:07,228
Megan... Meg?

581
00:57:09,105 --> 00:57:13,777
Dan, what is it,
are you all right?

582
00:57:17,697 --> 00:57:22,327
Dan, he's trying to speak,
the recorder!

583
00:57:24,996 --> 00:57:26,456
No!

584
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:28,333
Daddy!

585
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:29,501
Daddy, no!

586
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,294
No! No, Meg, don't go near him!

587
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:32,295
What the hell happened here?

588
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:34,255
Dan, you all right?

589
00:57:34,339 --> 00:57:36,132
Who's that?

590
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:41,971
That is Dean Halsey, sir.

591
00:57:42,097 --> 00:57:45,100
You see I came down here
to visit Mr. Cain,

592
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:48,103
who was here working
and Halsey entered

593
00:57:48,186 --> 00:57:51,106
and started ranting at us,
rather irrationally.

594
00:57:51,189 --> 00:57:52,607
No!

595
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,151
He was just angry!

596
00:57:55,235 --> 00:57:56,194
Daddy!

597
00:57:56,277 --> 00:57:57,237
Meg. What happened?

598
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,404
Who's that over there?

599
00:57:58,488 --> 00:58:00,281
Just a corpse.

600
00:58:00,365 --> 00:58:03,785
You see, Halsey came in,
grabbed that thing,

601
00:58:03,868 --> 00:58:07,163
and, well, went crazy.

602
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:08,665
Dean Halsey?

603
00:58:08,748 --> 00:58:09,707
Dean Halsey!

604
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,708
Arrest them!

605
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:12,585
I'm calling the police!

606
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:14,379
Oh, Daddy!

607
00:58:26,391 --> 00:58:30,979
Shock... don't worry.

608
01:01:33,129 --> 01:01:36,591
Daddy.

609
01:01:36,675 --> 01:01:39,135
He can't hear you, or see you.

610
01:01:39,219 --> 01:01:43,848
That's a one-way mirror.

611
01:01:43,932 --> 01:01:47,936
What is wrong with him, Doctor?

612
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:49,104
Will he ever be...

613
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:51,856
Until we know exactly what
happened to him,

614
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,696
there's no way to determine
his course of recovery.

615
01:01:57,737 --> 01:02:00,490
That's why I need you
to sign a release,

616
01:02:00,573 --> 01:02:04,703
so that I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

617
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:07,706
Is that absolutely necessary,
Dr. Hill?

618
01:02:07,747 --> 01:02:12,419
I know how difficult
this must be for you,

619
01:02:12,502 --> 01:02:17,716
but I'm convinced that your father's
problem is neurological.

620
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:20,969
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

621
01:02:24,514 --> 01:02:27,892
You must trust me.

622
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:42,949
I want to take a look at the
right frontal lobe.

623
01:02:43,032 --> 01:02:44,909
I'll open the skull here...

624
01:02:44,993 --> 01:02:47,912
I don't want to know.

625
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:51,249
Just help him.

626
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:14,939
Please, doctor.

627
01:03:15,023 --> 01:03:18,026
Please let me talk to him.

628
01:03:18,109 --> 01:03:20,695
No.

629
01:03:20,779 --> 01:03:24,991
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

630
01:03:25,074 --> 01:03:30,246
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

631
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:36,795
Or if you're ever lonely.

632
01:03:40,423 --> 01:03:44,302
I know you're all by yourself now.

633
01:03:53,144 --> 01:03:55,522
I'm going to take care
of him, doctor,

634
01:03:55,605 --> 01:03:59,067
and I'm going to find out
what happened to him.

635
01:06:02,233 --> 01:06:04,610
What are you doing here?

636
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:07,196
I've been waiting for you.

637
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,367
I have to tell you.

638
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:15,788
What did you do to him?

639
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:20,418
What did you and West do
to him to make him like that?

640
01:06:20,501 --> 01:06:24,881
It was... it was horrible.

641
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:28,467
I didn't...

642
01:06:28,551 --> 01:06:30,928
What did you do to him?

643
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:39,562
He's not insane.

644
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:47,069
He's dead.

645
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:51,449
No. No.

646
01:06:51,532 --> 01:06:55,036
You're insane,
you are insane, no!

647
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,079
You know it's true, Meg.

648
01:06:57,163 --> 01:06:58,706
You know it's true.

649
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:01,918
No.

650
01:07:05,338 --> 01:07:10,927
Daddy. Daddy.

651
01:07:14,472 --> 01:07:17,934
I'll tell you, Meg, everything.

652
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:32,698
Good evening, Mr. West.

653
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,705
What do you want?

654
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:42,792
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrillated.

655
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,210
I don't have to talk to you.

656
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,962
Why his pulse is erratic.

657
01:07:46,045 --> 01:07:48,130
I've told everything I know
to the police.

658
01:07:48,214 --> 01:07:50,466
Why he cries out in pain.

659
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:51,968
You can leave now, doctor.

660
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:56,764
When we both know
he is quite dead.

661
01:08:03,229 --> 01:08:06,983
Interesting little laboratory
you have here.

662
01:08:07,024 --> 01:08:12,363
Mr. West, I recognize this?

663
01:08:14,615 --> 01:08:16,534
What do you want?

664
01:08:16,617 --> 01:08:20,746
Yes, we are both scientists.

665
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,791
Let us get to the point.

666
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:31,007
I want your discovery.

667
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:34,885
Whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

668
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:37,179
Oh, it is not the appearance
of life, it is life.

669
01:08:37,263 --> 01:08:41,517
This is not magic, as you say,
I am a scientist.

670
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,104
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

671
01:08:45,187 --> 01:08:47,273
or a murderer.

672
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:56,532
You will do...

673
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:59,285
what I tell you to do.

674
01:09:32,526 --> 01:09:35,821
Ingenious, Mr. West.

675
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:41,160
Your extension of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

676
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:42,286
brilliant.

677
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:45,892
Has Dr. Hill examined
your father?

678
01:11:45,975 --> 01:11:47,268
Yes.

679
01:11:47,352 --> 01:11:50,980
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

680
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:53,316
Oh, shit.

681
01:11:53,399 --> 01:11:56,528
Then he'll find out.

682
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:59,781
Eventually he'll find out.

683
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:02,826
Let us see...

684
01:12:02,909 --> 01:12:06,287
my new serum at work?

685
01:12:09,249 --> 01:12:11,167
Dead cat tissue.

686
01:12:16,131 --> 01:12:20,176
Reagent.

687
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:45,410
Magnificent.

688
01:13:03,386 --> 01:13:06,806
Yes, Mr. West.

689
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:11,352
I will be famous.

690
01:13:22,322 --> 01:13:24,824
Laid to rest.

691
01:14:10,662 --> 01:14:13,498
Yes.

692
01:14:17,168 --> 01:14:20,004
Parts.

693
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:25,260
I've never done whole parts.

694
01:15:14,809 --> 01:15:19,564
Wesssssst

695
01:15:22,734 --> 01:15:24,819
Yes, doctor.

696
01:15:24,902 --> 01:15:27,488
It's Herbert West.

697
01:15:27,572 --> 01:15:28,740
What are you thinking?

698
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:32,744
How do you feel?

699
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:36,331
Yooooooou.

700
01:15:36,372 --> 01:15:37,498
" You."

701
01:15:37,582 --> 01:15:43,338
Baaassstaaard

702
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:21,185
Dan!

703
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:24,480
Oh my god, what has Hill
done to him?

704
01:17:29,694 --> 01:17:33,990
Looks like a laser drill.

705
01:17:34,073 --> 01:17:35,700
Your father's been lobotomized.

706
01:18:21,245 --> 01:18:24,499
That's it.

707
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:27,752
My work! My work!

708
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:28,794
What's going on?

709
01:18:28,878 --> 01:18:31,631
My work is gone.

710
01:18:31,714 --> 01:18:33,674
It's all gone.

711
01:18:33,758 --> 01:18:35,259
He took my serum!

712
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:36,677
Except for what
I have upstairs.

713
01:18:36,761 --> 01:18:38,179
Who?

714
01:18:38,262 --> 01:18:39,597
What happened here?

715
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:41,057
Hill.

716
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:44,101
Hill took my serum!
My notes! Everything.

717
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:45,186
Herbert, you're insane!

718
01:18:45,269 --> 01:18:47,438
- Now, what happened here?
- I had to kill him.

719
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:49,690
What?

720
01:18:49,774 --> 01:18:53,528
He's dead?

721
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:57,823
- Not any more.
- No, Herbert.

722
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,075
This has gotta stop!

723
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:00,701
Look, he tried
to blackmail me, Dan.

724
01:19:00,785 --> 01:19:01,702
Enough is enough!

725
01:19:01,786 --> 01:19:03,412
And he wanted you to disappear!

726
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:17,552
Oh. Oh.

727
01:19:17,635 --> 01:19:19,262
Oh, that's why he did
it to Halsey.

728
01:19:19,345 --> 01:19:20,596
What? You've seen Halsey?

729
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:23,849
He lobotomized him, so he could
control him in case

730
01:19:23,933 --> 01:19:26,185
he ever tried to talk or tell
somebody what happened.

731
01:19:26,269 --> 01:19:28,563
<i>So he could protect his discovery.</i>

732
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:30,314
- Yes.
- Very clever.

733
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,941
I gotta tell Meg.

734
01:19:32,024 --> 01:19:33,901
What does Meg
have to do with this?

735
01:19:33,985 --> 01:19:35,319
Hill's got this weird file on her,

736
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,905
it's full of napkins and hair
and photographs.

737
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:40,449
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need onto her.

738
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,676
Yes.

739
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,859
Alan.

740
01:21:45,157 --> 01:21:48,744
Alan.

741
01:22:18,816 --> 01:22:22,862
Oh... yes...

742
01:22:24,321 --> 01:22:26,449
Alan.

743
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:33,748
It's... time for you...

744
01:22:33,831 --> 01:22:37,543
to come out now.

745
01:23:10,117 --> 01:23:12,077
Is that you, Dr. Hill?

746
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:13,454
Of course it's me.

747
01:23:26,008 --> 01:23:28,093
Break time.

748
01:23:56,956 --> 01:24:00,835
That's... better.

749
01:25:14,214 --> 01:25:17,885
Meg? Meg!

750
01:25:17,968 --> 01:25:21,346
Dan? Dan...

751
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:24,933
- I was so afraid.
- What is it?

752
01:25:25,017 --> 01:25:27,019
What's the matter?

753
01:25:27,102 --> 01:25:31,273
Well... I don't know.

754
01:25:31,356 --> 01:25:33,400
I was just worried about you.

755
01:25:34,902 --> 01:25:37,154
Why?

756
01:25:37,237 --> 01:25:41,950
L...l just feel horrible
about everything.

757
01:25:44,995 --> 01:25:47,164
I guess I'm just getting paranoid.

758
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:53,253
It's just...

759
01:25:53,337 --> 01:25:54,922
so hard to lose you.

760
01:25:57,591 --> 01:26:00,010
You should go away.

761
01:26:02,387 --> 01:26:05,265
Transfer to another school.

762
01:26:05,349 --> 01:26:07,351
Don't worry about me.

763
01:26:10,103 --> 01:26:12,314
You're the one
that should get away.

764
01:26:15,233 --> 01:26:16,276
Go live your life.

765
01:26:20,364 --> 01:26:23,116
Find somebody.

766
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,243
I tried to hate you.

767
01:26:28,664 --> 01:26:31,500
I wanted so much to hate you.

768
01:26:36,838 --> 01:26:39,007
I love you.

769
01:26:41,218 --> 01:26:42,803
No! Daddy!

770
01:26:42,886 --> 01:26:47,224
Dr. Halsey.

771
01:26:47,307 --> 01:26:49,142
No, Daddy!

772
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:55,357
Oh, no, Daddy!

773
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,734
Daddy! Daddy!

774
01:27:11,832 --> 01:27:13,750
The door.

775
01:27:55,292 --> 01:27:57,919
Oh... yes.

776
01:28:44,091 --> 01:28:49,096
Dan? Dan?

777
01:28:49,179 --> 01:28:51,264
Dan?

778
01:28:51,348 --> 01:28:54,101
Come on.

779
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:58,647
Oh, well, you'll be all right.

780
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,108
Meg!

781
01:29:01,191 --> 01:29:02,400
Oh my god.

782
01:29:02,484 --> 01:29:03,902
Where, Herbert?

783
01:29:03,985 --> 01:29:06,780
He's at the hospital I imagine.
Can you stand up?

784
01:29:06,863 --> 01:29:08,115
Let's go.

785
01:29:14,037 --> 01:29:16,037
Oh... Meg.

786
01:29:58,165 --> 01:30:00,876
I've... always...

787
01:30:01,877 --> 01:30:05,463
admired your beauty, my dear.

788
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:12,220
I think I've always loved you.

789
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:23,315
You will love me.

790
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,115
You will.

791
01:30:34,659 --> 01:30:36,411
Please!

792
01:30:36,494 --> 01:30:38,496
Please stop!

793
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,207
Let me go!

794
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:43,710
That's it, my dearest Meg...

795
01:30:43,793 --> 01:30:46,463
more passion!

796
01:30:49,591 --> 01:30:54,221
- Oh my god!
- Yes, my love!

797
01:30:55,472 --> 01:30:57,224
I must say, Dr. Hill...

798
01:30:57,307 --> 01:31:00,977
I'm very disappointed in you.

799
01:31:01,061 --> 01:31:03,563
You steal the secret
of life and death,

800
01:31:03,647 --> 01:31:06,900
and here you are trysting
with the bubble-headed coed,

801
01:31:06,983 --> 01:31:09,778
you're not even
a second-rate scientist.

802
01:31:09,861 --> 01:31:13,114
Mr. West.

803
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:16,368
I'm actually glad to see you.

804
01:31:17,869 --> 01:31:22,874
It saves me the trouble
of having to send for you.

805
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:25,252
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

806
01:31:25,335 --> 01:31:26,962
Who's gonna believe
a talking head?

807
01:31:27,045 --> 01:31:28,838
Get a job in a sideshow.

808
01:31:28,922 --> 01:31:31,258
I wonder why

809
01:31:31,341 --> 01:31:35,720
an intelligent young man like yourself

810
01:31:37,472 --> 01:31:42,185
should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake,

811
01:31:42,269 --> 01:31:46,147
of coming here to challenge me.

812
01:31:47,148 --> 01:31:50,318
Oh... l have a plan.

813
01:31:50,402 --> 01:31:54,572
So do I.

814
01:32:11,631 --> 01:32:13,550
Let go of me!

815
01:32:33,653 --> 01:32:34,821
Enough!

816
01:32:48,668 --> 01:32:52,672
I will show you power, Mr. West!

817
01:32:52,756 --> 01:32:54,883
My discovery,

818
01:32:54,966 --> 01:32:57,802
a laser surgical drill.

819
01:32:57,886 --> 01:33:01,973
It makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy,

820
01:33:02,974 --> 01:33:07,020
which results in total mastery

821
01:33:07,103 --> 01:33:09,189
of the human will.

822
01:33:09,272 --> 01:33:12,275
Re-animated subjects

823
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:15,487
have proven to be the best.

824
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:19,366
They will give me power!

825
01:33:19,449 --> 01:33:22,702
Undreamed of power.

826
01:33:25,205 --> 01:33:27,082
Stay behind me.

827
01:33:31,628 --> 01:33:32,796
Daddy, listen to me.

828
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:35,131
It's Megan, Megan!

829
01:33:35,215 --> 01:33:39,135
- Hill, they'll kill her!
- Then I'll give her life!

830
01:33:41,137 --> 01:33:43,515
Look at me!

831
01:34:46,703 --> 01:34:47,787
Meg, come on!

832
01:34:47,871 --> 01:34:49,622
Let's go! Come on!

833
01:34:49,706 --> 01:34:50,623
Wait!

834
01:34:50,707 --> 01:34:52,375
I am not through here!

835
01:34:52,459 --> 01:34:54,794
Megan, no!

836
01:34:54,878 --> 01:34:58,339
- Let me go!
- I told you, I have a theory!

837
01:34:58,465 --> 01:35:00,675
- Overdose!
- No!

838
01:35:53,186 --> 01:35:56,606
Herbert!

839
01:36:14,874 --> 01:36:17,794
Look out!

840
01:36:24,592 --> 01:36:27,345
Daddy!

841
01:36:36,813 --> 01:36:37,814
My notes.

842
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:41,818
MY notes!

843
01:36:45,154 --> 01:36:47,198
Let's go.

844
01:37:15,602 --> 01:37:17,604
Come on!

845
01:38:27,924 --> 01:38:29,050
My god! Megan!

846
01:38:29,133 --> 01:38:30,093
Take her into number three!

847
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:32,553
Bring her this way!

848
01:38:36,391 --> 01:38:39,852
Hurry, hurry,
she's got nothing.

849
01:38:39,936 --> 01:38:42,522
Activating.

850
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:43,731
Air on.

851
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:52,490
Somebody give me some paste!

852
01:38:52,573 --> 01:38:53,783
On three.

853
01:38:56,285 --> 01:38:57,286
Okay, everybody off.

854
01:38:57,370 --> 01:39:00,248
Clear.

855
01:39:03,626 --> 01:39:05,294
Nothing.

856
01:39:06,295 --> 01:39:07,880
Bringing back air.

857
01:39:10,842 --> 01:39:12,719
The trachea's fractured.

858
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,095
She's fixed and dilated.

859
01:39:14,178 --> 01:39:16,639
No response.

860
01:39:21,102 --> 01:39:24,981
Cain... Cain.

861
01:41:04,163 --> 01:41:05,832
I love you.

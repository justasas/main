1
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,247
You're not scared, are you?

2
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:47,583
Scared?
Why should I be scared?

3
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,796
We're next to a cemetery.

4
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:57,926
So?

5
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:00,470
If anything were to happen,

6
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,016
no-one would hear a thing.

7
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,263
What could possibly happen?

8
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:11,020
Remember the guy they caught,
the one who was killing kids?

9
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:12,611
Yeah. And what?

10
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:14,321
Wanna know the worst?

11
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:17,405
What's that?
Chocolate milk?

12
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:20,529
He ate them.
Carried parts around in a cooler.

13
00:01:20,703 --> 00:01:21,782
Making that up!

14
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:22,950
Am not!

15
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:25,203
My sister knows a newspaper guy.

16
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,912
He told her.

17
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:31,251
When they caught him,
know what was in the cooler?

18
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:33,789
Their fingers?

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,799
Oh, gross!

20
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,889
It's a sheep's eye.
From the butcher shop.

21
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:45,973
When you die, the last thing you
see is on your retina

22
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:47,807
like a photograph.

23
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,388
Grandma says souls
live in the eyes.

24
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:53,525
The "soul" is an invention
of witch doctors.

25
00:01:58,407 --> 00:02:00,151
There's someone out there!

26
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,338
There's no-one here.

27
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:27,392
There was. I heard him!

28
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,701
Howie?

29
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,785
Howie, is that you?

30
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:54,917
Howie, no more games,
you hear me?

31
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:19,609
Howie?

32
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,077
You forgot to close it.

33
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:35,161
No. You were the last one.

34
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:18,286
Jesus!

35
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,712
Why you guys sneaking around?

36
00:04:20,883 --> 00:04:22,164
We weren't sneaking!

37
00:04:22,343 --> 00:04:23,125
You were.

38
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:27,298
Like a pair of rats.

39
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:50,325
No!

40
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:20,520
Let me go.

41
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:26,814
In the house!

42
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:34,618
Halt!

43
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,189
Emily!
Wake up Emily.

44
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,320
Come back.

45
00:06:37,436 --> 00:06:38,551
Let me go!

46
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:40,888
- Stay in there.
- Let me go!

47
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,558
What did you do to that "thing"?

48
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,395
You have no right!

49
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:43,785
Thirteen years later.

50
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:04,986
West.

51
00:11:07,582 --> 00:11:08,827
What you got there?

52
00:11:09,876 --> 00:11:11,500
That some kind of animal?

53
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:12,457
Why, Moncho?

54
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:13,909
Are you hungry?

55
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,287
Is that a rat?

56
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:20,215
Your powers of observation
are dubious at best.

57
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:23,836
Dubious?

58
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,762
Dubious.

59
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:30,468
You wanted me?

60
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:31,560
Yes.

61
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:32,931
Here.

62
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:39,820
New work assignment?

63
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,193
Dubious.

64
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,282
Oh, and it's "Sergeant" Moncho.

65
00:11:49,707 --> 00:11:50,870
Ratty?

66
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:09,890
What did you do to Ratty?

67
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:12,973
Mother of God,
I ain't seen him, I swear.

68
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:15,063
I'm sick. Leave me alone.

69
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,857
Where is Ratty?

70
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,520
What's wrong, Cabrera?

71
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:20,688
Lose you stinky little pal?

72
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:24,773
Ask West if he's seen him.

73
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:26,993
West likes animals.

74
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,536
What do you mean?

75
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,207
Think about it,

76
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,991
"dubious".

77
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,007
Line up!

78
00:12:56,357 --> 00:12:57,388
Let's move!

79
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,172
West, you seen my Ratty?

80
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:23,504
Is he missing?

81
00:13:23,676 --> 00:13:25,669
You better tell me, Einstein!

82
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:28,965
Any identifiable characteristics?
Markings...

83
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,713
Who took him is
gonna get markings.

84
00:13:48,743 --> 00:13:50,285
You the new doctor?

85
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,402
That's right.

86
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:52,990
That way to the Clinic?

87
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:54,741
Warden wants to see you.

88
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,382
In films, this is the Death House.

89
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,294
You wouldn't call it that.

90
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:08,714
What do you call it?

91
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:10,512
The Death House.

92
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:25,521
- Prisoners here are?
- Condemned to death.

93
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,829
Don't talk until
he talks to you first.

94
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,078
...are sex criminals.

95
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:38,740
As a woman,
that should repulse you.

96
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,412
It's very disturbing,
as a person.

97
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:47,590
But as a reporter it' s
an interesting statistic.

98
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,712
Good answer, Laura.

99
00:14:51,347 --> 00:14:54,052
- Can I call you Laura?
- Certainly.

100
00:14:54,433 --> 00:14:57,767
So, you don't believe
in rehabilitation.

101
00:14:58,145 --> 00:14:59,937
Don't be naive, Laura.

102
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:02,730
I believe in what works.

103
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,231
Two thousand volts
of raw power from

104
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,737
a stand alone generator.

105
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:12,276
This works.

106
00:15:13,619 --> 00:15:15,411
When a man sits in it

107
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:18,742
and I make every
new prisoner sit in it

108
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,247
they submit to my power.

109
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,961
Fascinating.

110
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,752
You're just saying that.

111
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:39,094
- Doctor Phillips?
- Yes, sir. Howard Phillips.

112
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:42,102
It's a pleasure, Warden Brando.

113
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:48,403
You graduated in the top
five per cent of your class.

114
00:15:49,363 --> 00:15:51,522
You could have your pick ofjobs.

115
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:53,027
Why here?

116
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,774
Institutional medicine interests me...

117
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:57,610
Really?

118
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,408
Well. Yeah.

119
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:01,830
Hi. I'm Laura Olney.

120
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,709
I'm with Arkham Record.

121
00:16:03,878 --> 00:16:07,626
Anything you say to me
will be quoted out of context.

122
00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:10,551
Well in that case,
let me just say hi.

123
00:16:10,968 --> 00:16:11,917
Hi.

124
00:16:15,306 --> 00:16:18,260
We have a fully equipped
medical facility.

125
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,972
I'm sure you do,
but these are mine.

126
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:25,179
Do all doctors have such a
relationship with their tools?

127
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,987
You requested to have
a particular inmate

128
00:16:31,155 --> 00:16:32,946
working in the infirmary.

129
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:36,781
We're understaffed and he
has a medical background.

130
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,620
Keep an eye on him.

131
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:39,862
Sir?

132
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:44,960
He thinks he's smarter than
everyone else, but he's not.

133
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,833
His attitude could infect others.

134
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:49,836
"Infect"?

135
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,636
An idea can be like a disease.

136
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,804
If you discover a minor anomaly,

137
00:16:57,473 --> 00:16:58,754
do you ignore it?

138
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,263
Fuck!

139
00:17:00,434 --> 00:17:02,676
No, Doctor. No. You cut it.

140
00:17:02,853 --> 00:17:04,513
Some growths are benign.

141
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,681
Not inside these walls.

142
00:17:09,652 --> 00:17:10,601
Sir!

143
00:17:11,237 --> 00:17:12,897
There's a situation!

144
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:15,528
0ut of the way!

145
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,148
It's the doctor!

146
00:17:19,412 --> 00:17:22,496
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

147
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,238
Hear my confession.

148
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:25,531
Just calm down.

149
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,547
The blood, the flesh,
the beating heart.

150
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,382
I had to eat it.
I had to eat it.

151
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,298
Don't send me to Hell.

152
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,391
Get the drop cloth.

153
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:52,355
Keep his back perfectly straight.

154
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:54,271
Sorry!

155
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:57,358
Keep your hands off me!

156
00:17:57,658 --> 00:17:58,856
On three, okay?

157
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:02,611
One, two, three, lift!

158
00:18:02,788 --> 00:18:04,283
This way, doctor.

159
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:05,829
0ut of the way!

160
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
Get the case.

161
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:15,501
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Thanks.

162
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:19,335
I'm fine.

163
00:18:21,307 --> 00:18:22,587
Where do we go?

164
00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,097
What happened?

165
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:27,593
Heart attack.

166
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:32,853
Are you the new doctor?
Cute!

167
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:38,198
Get him on the table!

168
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,157
Nurse, set up the IV.

169
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:47,156
Hurry up!

170
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,198
Yes doctor.

171
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:51,284
Get me amiodarone.

172
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:52,660
- What?
- Amiodarone

173
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:53,918
We have none.

174
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,336
You have none?

175
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:56,622
It didn't come.

176
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,541
What have you got?

177
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:00,174
Try Sotalol.

178
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,217
It is similar.

179
00:19:03,266 --> 00:19:04,297
Go get it!

180
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:11,679
Come on Nurse!

181
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:12,723
Coming!

182
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:20,946
I can't!

183
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,319
Could you help her, please?

184
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:36,499
Nurse, take these guys out of the way.

185
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,084
Everybody out!

186
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:40,582
And stay out there!

187
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:41,543
But...

188
00:19:41,721 --> 00:19:42,919
Stay with them!

189
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:44,510
Clear!

190
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,182
You're wasting time.

191
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,549
Clear!

192
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,259
Come on!

193
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:51,268
Clear!

194
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,641
He was dead before he got here.

195
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,355
Goddammit!

196
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:04,564
He was my patient.

197
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:06,530
For five minutes.

198
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,783
You're the new doctor?

199
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,588
What is the meaning of this?

200
00:20:24,805 --> 00:20:26,513
Doctor Herbert West.

201
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,760
I know all about you.

202
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:30,514
Really?

203
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,431
I know what you did.

204
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,646
They tried to cover it up.

205
00:20:36,025 --> 00:20:37,484
Your experiments...

206
00:20:39,695 --> 00:20:41,522
Don't believe what you hear.

207
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:43,108
I didn't hear it.

208
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,231
I saw.

209
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:51,619
That night they arrested you.
I was that kid.

210
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:05,630
I want to work with you.

211
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:24,021
Thirteen years...

212
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:29,444
There's bound to be
some deterioration.

213
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,788
The reactive base

214
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,576
may have destabilized

215
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:42,503
but maybe not.

216
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:48,430
What are you doing?

217
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,383
Seeing if it still works.

218
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:51,507
No!

219
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,061
Someone could come in.

220
00:21:55,229 --> 00:21:57,222
We're treating a patient.

221
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:04,192
The top of the spinal cord!

222
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:05,901
0f course

223
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,320
. Hold his head.

224
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:11,740
Hold it.

225
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:13,611
Quickly.

226
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:29,094
How long will it take?

227
00:22:29,263 --> 00:22:31,885
I don't think it's going to take.

228
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,387
We can increase the dosage.

229
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:38,934
No, no. It's not going to work.

230
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:41,354
It might on something else.

231
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:45,398
Thanks for bringing me
back my Reagent

232
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,030
such as it is.

233
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,147
Oh well...

234
00:22:50,618 --> 00:22:51,733
Wait a minute.

235
00:22:53,037 --> 00:22:54,116
Listen.

236
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,622
Think about it. Come on.

237
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,913
We can make more.

238
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:04,334
In here?

239
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:09,378
This place doesn't have basic
first aid, as you just found out.

240
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,088
But this is my clinic now.
What do you need?

241
00:23:19,772 --> 00:23:21,314
It still works!

242
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:24,728
You're not dying.
How do you feel?

243
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:25,941
You hear me?

244
00:23:26,237 --> 00:23:27,067
Stay away!

245
00:23:27,321 --> 00:23:28,780
Can you hear me?

246
00:23:29,949 --> 00:23:31,064
No!

247
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:36,621
We must sedate him!

248
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,328
Get the Thorazine!

249
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:50,084
50 cc.

250
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,076
No! No!

251
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:28,000
Forgive me, please.

252
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,748
Forgive me!

253
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:37,382
Dr. Phillips.

254
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,066
What the fuck's going?

255
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:47,811
He went crazy, sir.

256
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:53,405
Severe cardiac arrhythmia.

257
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:55,152
A reaction to medication.

258
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,243
What medication?

259
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:08,290
We administered 10 cc
of Sotalol but it

260
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,921
provoked an unexpected effect.

261
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,506
You call this
"an unexpected effect"?

262
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,139
The patient suffered
arterial fibrillation.

263
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,969
His heart was beating too fast.

264
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,726
Allergic reaction is not unusual.

265
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,945
West, you've just added twelve
months to your sentence.

266
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,904
It's swollen.

267
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,782
Doctor Phillips, one of
my men is hurt.

268
00:25:41,956 --> 00:25:43,367
I'll see to him.

269
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:47,454
Sergeant, that is
an immediate Lock-Down!

270
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:48,418
Yes, Sir!

271
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:59,972
The rest of your visit will be
outside of the security areas.

272
00:26:00,182 --> 00:26:01,048
Warden...

273
00:26:01,225 --> 00:26:01,889
West,

274
00:26:03,394 --> 00:26:05,268
the lockdown includes you.

275
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,475
Doctor Phillips asked me for
a list of the supplies we need.

276
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:12,812
Right. I need that list.

277
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,277
Clean him up and
get him to the Hole!

278
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,532
Come on.

279
00:26:20,995 --> 00:26:22,074
Get up.

280
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,667
West, get to your cell!

281
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,590
My last partner turned
State's evidence on me.

282
00:26:40,848 --> 00:26:42,675
I expect better of you.

283
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,725
And watch out for her.
She's trouble.

284
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:35,732
Hi there.

285
00:27:38,197 --> 00:27:41,732
Hi. Just organizing my notes.

286
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:46,069
You were right about my ankle.

287
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,491
I should stay off it.

288
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,789
Hard to push in the clutch.

289
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:53,120
How about I drive you home?

290
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,370
Are you sure?

291
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:00,960
I'm putting you to trouble.

292
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,551
On a day like this,
it's no trouble.

293
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,011
Had yourself a big day, Moses.

294
00:28:12,773 --> 00:28:16,901
Beat the hell out of 4 grown men
while having a heart attack.

295
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,689
How did you do that?

296
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,064
They gave you some medication.

297
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,280
What was it?

298
00:28:28,956 --> 00:28:30,996
- I know why I'm here.
- Yes?

299
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:34,583
I'm dead, and this is Hell.

300
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,920
I'll show you what Hell is.

301
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:48,596
West!

302
00:28:49,977 --> 00:28:52,515
You and me
have got to talk, man!

303
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,310
West!

304
00:28:56,734 --> 00:28:57,813
West!

305
00:29:00,154 --> 00:29:01,862
Sorry about the tofu...

306
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:04,480
I should know.

307
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,939
This pizza's great.

308
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,862
I've had a great time.

309
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,408
Great

310
00:29:10,706 --> 00:29:14,040
The way you handled that
interview impressed me.

311
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:18,373
I did such a great job
I was thrown out.

312
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:25,171
State Penitentiary Progressive
Educational is so stupid.

313
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,797
Come on, don't give up.

314
00:29:28,015 --> 00:29:30,091
Anything's possible.

315
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:33,429
See the possibilities
and seize the moment.

316
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:34,933
Go for it.

317
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,929
- "Go for it"?
- Yeah.

318
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,857
Okay, I'll "go for it".

319
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:45,276
What are you really
doing here?

320
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,117
"Institutional medicine".

321
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:55,164
Tell me about your
secret "I.M." research.

322
00:29:57,044 --> 00:29:58,159
Of course.

323
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:05,215
I am investigating the effects of
institutionalization on life and death.

324
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,131
- Yes.
- Yeah.

325
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,603
Why do your residency
in the "joint"?

326
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:21,610
Really. Why, Howard?

327
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,740
As a kid, I saw my sister die.

328
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,915
I'm so sorry.

329
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,621
I never want to
feel helpless again.

330
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:49,635
I tried to resuscitate her.

331
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,556
I wanted to bring her back.

332
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,969
Who was helping you today?

333
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,022
Doctor Herbert West.

334
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:05,986
He's a prisoner but, he worked
at a university hospital.

335
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:12,076
He researched death as a disease.

336
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,953
One of his reanimation
experiments lost control.

337
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:21,582
The man went crazy... violent.

338
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,213
Like the man today?

339
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,457
And escaped
from the Morgue.

340
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:26,629
The morgue?

341
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,425
He broke into our house.

342
00:31:37,603 --> 00:31:41,683
That expression
reminds me of Emily.

343
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,812
Your sister?

344
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,022
You're going?

345
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,197
- It's been a long day.
- Yeah.

346
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:11,418
Looks like your ankle is better.

347
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,175
Yeah.

348
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,642
Seize the moment?

349
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,520
Go for it.

350
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,578
You got everything.

351
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,626
Moses isn't doing so good.

352
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,332
We need lab. Space,

353
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,508
somewhere private.

354
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,053
He doesn't seem human.

355
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,618
I think this will do.

356
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,496
He's a monster.

357
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,957
He was the freshest
specimen we could find.

358
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,705
It's a problem.

359
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,503
It is a problem!

360
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:33,173
I want to help people, not
create mindless freaks!

361
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,254
Having second thoughts?

362
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,843
All medical research
requires risks.

363
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,843
If you don't see,
you shouldn't be here.

364
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:48,434
Soon I'll find a force to bring
order to that chaotic organism.

365
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,736
Away to restore
rational behaviour?

366
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,904
I can now accelerate the
testing phase of my current work.

367
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,864
With your help.

368
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,873
This work requires commitment

369
00:34:07,044 --> 00:34:08,752
and full confidentiality.

370
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,754
You must tell no one.

371
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,379
- I'll walk?
- Lipstick on your collar.

372
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,885
Doctor Phillips, I'm going
to be leaving now.

373
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,842
What's that for?

374
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,785
Doctor Phillips.
Do you need anything?

375
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:24,742
Are you there?

376
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,050
I was afraid you weren't coming.

377
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,096
I was working late.

378
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,386
On what?

379
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,896
Nothing. Just clinic stuff.

380
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,314
What are you doing,
investigating me?

381
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,770
- No.
- Yeah.

382
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,784
I was wondering how
the man was doing.

383
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:05,943
He's fine.

384
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,451
Really?

385
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,791
Doesn't seem human anymore.

386
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,338
We shouldn't have...

387
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,499
You shouldn't have, what?

388
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,299
What's the matter?

389
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:32,311
The story I'm on.
I figured out some stuff,

390
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,725
but it's just speculation.

391
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,731
- You need hard facts.
- Yeah.

392
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,573
But to get them I'll
have to take some risks.

393
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,118
What do I do?

394
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,322
Play it safe, or "go for it"?

395
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,035
You've got to "go for it".

396
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,826
Really?

397
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,335
You got to take some chances.

398
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,126
That's what you're doing,
isn't it?

399
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,888
What's your new story about?

400
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,517
Can't tell you yet.

401
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,434
Secrets?

402
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,946
Every girl needs a few secrets.

403
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,002
It hurts so much.

404
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,080
I can't even spit, Doc.

405
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,631
I don't see anything.

406
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,373
Once they gave me
little red pills,

407
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,043
Vicodin, made me feel better.

408
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,344
Little red pills. Little red

409
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,845
tits.

410
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,595
- Take two at bedtime.
- How about now?

411
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,971
Can I have more?

412
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,784
- Today's the day, cabrón.
- Today's the day.

413
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,162
I'll see you in the yard.

414
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,626
- You're a dead man.
- Adead man.

415
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,055
Today's the day.
It worked.

416
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,183
Reschedule the afternoon.

417
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,221
But doctor...

418
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,911
Now. To test it.

419
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,163
On who?

420
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,922
My story isn't working,
it's too impersonal.

421
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,597
Something's missing.
And it's you. You're the key.

422
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,272
The key?
To what?

423
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,156
To understanding how
this prison works.

424
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,199
Everything is an extension
of your philosophy.

425
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,993
I'd like another look around.

426
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,836
Afterwards I'll need you for
an in-depth interview.

427
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,712
I'd be happy to do the interview

428
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,009
- if...
- lf?

429
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,387
If we do it over dinner tonight.

430
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,311
You get to know
the man behind the office.

431
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,808
After my tour?

432
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:06,600
Consider Miss Olney
my personal guest.

433
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,775
Yes, sir.

434
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,986
And give her the tour, again.

435
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,871
Why did you come back?

436
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,575
To finish a profile on you.

437
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,493
Really?

438
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,213
You are a fascinating man.

439
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,257
You're just saying that.

440
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,303
Tonight then.

441
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,218
Did you know
the human body loses

442
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,012
3 to 4 grms. Of weight
at the moment of death?

443
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,107
I heard about that.

444
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,103
A rodent loses much less,
but the ratio is the same.

445
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:56,822
The cerebral cortex is the site

446
00:40:56,996 --> 00:41:00,697
of an extraordinary
neuro-electric phenomenon.

447
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,282
Hold him.

448
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,784
Hold him

449
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,256
Tightly.

450
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,890
Ratty is not going
to be very happy.

451
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,730
This phenomenon,

452
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:27,690
NPE, Nano-Plasmic Energy,

453
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,399
is not just in the brain.

454
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:36,532
It moves throughout the nervous system,
and is present in every cell of the body.

455
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,871
Hold him a little.

456
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:45,208
Classic post-reanimation.
Confused, violent.

457
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,540
Like all my other
subjects to date.

458
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:53,799
This brought him back
from the dead.

459
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,051
But this will give him true life.

460
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,049
What is that?

461
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,726
The Nanoplasm,
from a living donor rat.

462
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,222
Donor rat?

463
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,687
Now hold him.
Completely still.

464
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,531
This is the catalyst.

465
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,786
This is the force that tells
the cells how to grow.

466
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,117
It works!

467
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,162
Laura.

468
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,284
Doctor Phillips, how are you?

469
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,873
Why are you here?

470
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,503
Just, "going for it".

471
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:22,009
- That the way to the "hole"?
- Certainly is.

472
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,932
I would really like
to talk to him.

473
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,227
Not a chance.

474
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,904
My Editor gives
expenses for stories.

475
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,407
How much are we talking here?

476
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,369
The cell door has to be locked.

477
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,461
I'll be back in ten minutes.

478
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,842
What if I need you?

479
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,339
Do I call?

480
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:10,227
Not a sound.
No one can know you're in there.

481
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,975
He can't hurt you
in that straight jacket.

482
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,586
Look who's coming.

483
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:42,344
She's going to see Moses.
Why else would she do there?

484
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,547
All right, give him to me.

485
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,113
Any last words pendejo?

486
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:12,240
Ratty?

487
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,211
What happened?

488
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,427
I gave him his pet back.

489
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:27,591
Are you gonna let him go?

490
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,391
Give Daddy a kiss.

491
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,472
What's wrong, Ratty?

492
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:37,106
Hi. I'm Laura Olney,
I'm a journalist.

493
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:41,942
I want to talk about what
happened the other day.

494
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:50,489
Do you remember what
Dr. West did to you?

495
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,501
Did you die from
that heart attack?

496
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:08,761
Can I check your pulse?

497
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,896
Mother of God, forgive me.

498
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,562
What happened to you?

499
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:27,319
- Hungry!
- Sergeant Moncho!

500
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,785
Thank God you're here.

501
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,620
You must think I'm an idiot.

502
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:38,494
No I don't. Really.

503
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,961
You're a very intelligent man.

504
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,752
Fascinating.

505
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:52,508
- I don't like people lying to me.
- I wasn't lying.

506
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,103
Explain!

507
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,128
Give me that!

508
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:31,932
He attacked me.

509
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,016
He's dead.

510
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,852
You're right.

511
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,653
What are you doing?

512
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:49,063
I murdered him.
That's what they'll say.

513
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,114
You know the cretins out there.

514
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,781
It was self-defence.
You had no choice.

515
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,044
I'll swear to it.

516
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:16,222
Get down. You're going
to have to convince me.

517
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,017
Lower. Bark.

518
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:25,020
- What?
- You heard me! Bark!

519
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,994
Am I the most fascinating
man you've met?

520
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:41,993
Yes.

521
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,502
And you'd do anything for me?

522
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,791
Yes, sir.

523
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,040
Show me.

524
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:58,516
You bribed a guard, came in and
freed a dangerous prisoner. He

525
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,551
got excited...

526
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,896
- I wanna get Moses up here.
- Why?

527
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,030
To put this in him.

528
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:13,819
You've got more?

529
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:17,285
No. This is Ratty's NPE.

530
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,954
I gave Ratty the nanoplasm
of a different rodent.

531
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,698
- Aren't they different?
- Not at all.

532
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:28,333
Nanoplasm is a completely
neutral energy.

533
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,042
It's the same in rats,
dogs, human beings.

534
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,342
- You want to put this in Moses?
- Yes.

535
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,758
Going from rat to rat is okay,

536
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:43,470
but from species to
species is not right.

537
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,767
Not right?

538
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:56,111
All this is the result of years
and years of painstaking

539
00:49:56,786 --> 00:50:00,036
research under
incomprehensible conditions.

540
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,613
How dare you say
my work is wrong?

541
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:05,995
- You can't transfer the soul...
- The soul?

542
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,791
This is science,
not superstition.

543
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:11,586
- This is a human being...
- Was human.

544
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,131
And will be again, with this.

545
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:17,010
Dr. Phillips?

546
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:18,844
1, 2, 3, up.

547
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,806
Dr. Phillips.

548
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,270
There's been an incident.

549
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:45,913
No!

550
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,078
No!

551
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:57,885
Moses killed her in the Hole.

552
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,591
He's dead, too.

553
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:01,137
Dead?

554
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,515
The Warden needs
Death Certificates.

555
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:05,886
Now!

556
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:14,321
Get rid of the nurse.

557
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,148
Nurse, help the officers.

558
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:17,569
- But...
- Get out!

559
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:46,639
- What if she ends up like Moses?
- She's not getting fresher.

560
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,935
Come on.

561
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:02,161
- Top of the spinal cord, right?
- Right.

562
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,748
Thorazine?

563
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,251
Don't want her getting
too excited.

564
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,553
Hurry up.

565
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,482
What's her name?

566
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,368
- Remember?
- Leave her!

567
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,541
This is not a good idea.

568
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,558
What is she doing?

569
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,327
We can't leave her like this!

570
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:30,497
Let's get her to the lab.

571
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:40,665
Stop here.

572
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,557
Where did he go?

573
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:50,258
He's got to be here, somewhere!

574
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,218
Look everywhere.

575
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:53,594
Everywhere!

576
00:54:04,408 --> 00:54:06,033
Poor little thing.

577
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,195
Come on, go get your food.

578
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,000
Let go, you freak.

579
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,687
What's going on?

580
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,807
Give it back!

581
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:03,004
- You little...
- No!

582
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:05,041
And why not?

583
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,678
It's cross species.

584
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:08,838
Then she'll stay like this!

585
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,638
You can't experimenting on her.

586
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,310
Now look, Rat NPE...

587
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:14,307
Dr. Phillips!

588
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,476
Get her down.

589
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:26,071
Where is the body?

590
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:27,272
She...

591
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,243
What is going on in here?

592
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,242
Mr West and I... we...

593
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,292
You've set up a Lab.

594
00:55:41,464 --> 00:55:43,670
You're doing illegal research.

595
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,999
You'll lose your job for this,
and your medical license.

596
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,015
Move.

597
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:08,241
This is what you gave Moses.

598
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:16,615
You are never going to see the
outside of these walls again.

599
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,288
No. No.

600
00:56:30,555 --> 00:56:31,717
You're dead.

601
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:33,673
No!

602
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:52,154
Hold it there!

603
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:55,866
Come back here.

604
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,791
Back in your cell!

605
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,240
It's party time!

606
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:20,640
What are you doing?

607
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:23,225
Wait. Just a second.

608
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:26,940
Two thousand volts
of electric current will

609
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,567
concentrate the nanoplasm to
the brain, so we can pull it off.

610
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,401
You'll electrocute him.

611
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,357
That's the idea.

612
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:40,162
Only through, electrocution
can you

613
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:44,750
drive the nanoplasm to
the hypothalamus where

614
00:57:45,213 --> 00:57:48,048
we can extract it at
the moment of death.

615
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:51,466
You wanna put his
nanoplasm into Laura?

616
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:54,969
Rodent to rodent, no problem.
But human to human?

617
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,593
Do you want Laura
to stay like that?

618
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:01,390
Sit him up.

619
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,228
Head down on his chest.

620
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:05,307
Move!
Hold his head still!

621
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:14,907
Hold his head still!

622
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,406
He's not dying!

623
00:58:19,455 --> 00:58:20,736
He's not dying!

624
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:24,332
Clear!

625
00:58:31,968 --> 00:58:33,082
That's enough!

626
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:36,176
Stop it!

627
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:37,462
He has to die.

628
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,742
Go to the infirmary.

629
00:58:58,911 --> 00:58:59,741
Let's go!

630
00:59:08,462 --> 00:59:09,458
Ratty!

631
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:11,538
Ratty!

632
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:13,210
Give daddy a kiss!

633
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:06,342
Howard? Where am I?

634
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,760
You're okay now.

635
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:12,518
Something happened to me.

636
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,070
You could say that.

637
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,774
Why are you looking at me?

638
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,615
Warden Brando strangled you.

639
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,532
You were dead.

640
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:27,743
Doctor Phillips and
I brought you back.

641
01:00:28,876 --> 01:00:30,916
What're you talking about?

642
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,125
Brought me back?

643
01:00:35,925 --> 01:00:37,503
- I feel so...
- What?

644
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,130
How do you feel?

645
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,144
That's interesting.

646
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,028
What's happening?

647
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:28,727
I see what's going on here.

648
01:01:30,354 --> 01:01:32,976
You are using me as a guinea pig.

649
01:01:33,232 --> 01:01:34,608
You let him do it!

650
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:35,641
No!

651
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:37,934
Stay away.

652
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:40,614
Both of you.

653
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:51,323
Stop!

654
01:01:53,878 --> 01:01:56,451
Howard. Howard, please.

655
01:01:57,173 --> 01:01:58,632
Please help me.

656
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,581
Howard.

657
01:02:05,681 --> 01:02:06,677
West!

658
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:09,428
Where are you Einstein?

659
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,761
Hiding is not gonna do you...

660
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:17,055
Listen, Ratty's acting
really weird.

661
01:02:17,235 --> 01:02:20,189
You fucked him up,
or gave me the wrong rat!

662
01:02:20,363 --> 01:02:22,439
- Get your hands off!
- Guards!

663
01:02:23,824 --> 01:02:26,315
There ain't no fucking guards.

664
01:02:26,494 --> 01:02:27,988
This place is a riot.

665
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,824
- Look here.
- Leave her alone!

666
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,454
What'd you say?

667
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:37,290
Stay away. She's sick.
Contagious.

668
01:02:37,964 --> 01:02:38,995
Sick?

669
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:42,629
I got medicine,
make her feel better.

670
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:46,586
West took my ratty.
I'll take his little pussycat.

671
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,468
What's happening Howard?

672
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,604
You like it rough, huh?

673
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:16,372
Laura!

674
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:27,716
Laura!

675
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,011
Over here.

676
01:03:31,767 --> 01:03:32,882
Come on!

677
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:36,687
- Where is she?
- Who?

678
01:03:36,898 --> 01:03:38,605
Laura. The journalist.

679
01:03:38,774 --> 01:03:40,352
They were chasing her.

680
01:03:40,526 --> 01:03:42,851
- There was no woman.
- She's there.

681
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:44,143
Seal it off!

682
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,357
Laura! Laura!

683
01:04:33,955 --> 01:04:35,200
This way's dead!

684
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:37,071
Shit!

685
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,257
Don't you play hide
and seek with me.

686
01:04:53,057 --> 01:04:55,809
Daddy has a big present for you.

687
01:04:58,312 --> 01:04:59,510
Cesar, find her.

688
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:44,938
Surprise!

689
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:27,227
Welcome back Warden.

690
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:32,357
Before I leave, one last
experiment, and you're pertect.

691
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:37,660
Those three years in
Solitary were very instructive.

692
01:06:37,828 --> 01:06:42,740
I did my best work in there...
and this is the result.

693
01:06:44,126 --> 01:06:46,036
Rodent to human.

694
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:49,672
Neutral energy,

695
01:06:53,261 --> 01:06:55,633
or behavioral imprinting?

696
01:06:56,973 --> 01:06:58,681
Let's find out.

697
01:07:14,907 --> 01:07:17,066
West, you cretin.

698
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,703
You'll fry for this.

699
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,448
Do you hear that?

700
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:26,126
There's a riot going on.
The animals are running the zoo.

701
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:29,208
They'll make their way down here

702
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,495
quite soon.

703
01:07:34,343 --> 01:07:37,380
I'd like to see the results,
but I can't.

704
01:07:37,597 --> 01:07:41,215
There's a new early
release programme

705
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:43,012
and I qualify.

706
01:07:46,939 --> 01:07:51,518
I'll be sure and leave the door
wide open so they find you.

707
01:08:26,562 --> 01:08:28,104
Take these will you?

708
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:29,435
And these.

709
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:00,385
Come on, come on.

710
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:37,591
Shit!

711
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:41,462
- It's the Warden.
- He's not Warden anymore.

712
01:09:48,895 --> 01:09:50,472
You don't dare...

713
01:09:55,151 --> 01:09:56,894
I am always the Warden.

714
01:10:02,408 --> 01:10:04,068
I need a doctor.

715
01:10:04,493 --> 01:10:07,364
Sergeant, you let that man go.

716
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,489
Sergeant Moncho!
Straighten up!

717
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:19,084
On your feet, Sergeant!

718
01:10:25,014 --> 01:10:27,422
Stand up! That's an order!

719
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:32,558
How can I get you
to follow orders?

720
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,318
The good stuff!

721
01:11:15,231 --> 01:11:16,144
Laura!

722
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:19,939
Laura!

723
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:06,689
Are these men
giving you a problem?

724
01:12:09,327 --> 01:12:10,904
I didn't do that.

725
01:12:11,078 --> 01:12:13,237
Well maybe I did.

726
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:17,078
Or maybe they killed themselves.

727
01:12:17,627 --> 01:12:20,996
They couldn't stand living
with their crimes.

728
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:30,804
They couldn't stand looking
in the mirror one more day.

729
01:12:33,017 --> 01:12:36,718
Me, I like what
I see in the mirror.

730
01:12:53,621 --> 01:12:56,741
The Death House was built
for one purpose.

731
01:12:57,208 --> 01:12:58,536
Punishment.

732
01:13:00,545 --> 01:13:03,996
The problem with execution
is it happens too fast.

733
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:06,753
One moment of pain,
and you're dead.

734
01:13:08,052 --> 01:13:09,380
You're off the hook.

735
01:13:10,638 --> 01:13:14,089
Today's criminals aren't
scared any more.

736
01:13:14,642 --> 01:13:16,718
He looks scared to me.

737
01:13:17,353 --> 01:13:20,389
Just acting.
They're all actors here.

738
01:13:21,649 --> 01:13:25,978
Execution is the kindest thing
we could do for them.

739
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:29,027
But what if the agony of Death

740
01:13:30,616 --> 01:13:32,490
didn't end in an instant

741
01:13:38,457 --> 01:13:41,375
but instead, was prolonged

742
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:45,249
indefinitely?

743
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:28,914
Move out!

744
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:31,958
Quick! Quick!

745
01:15:06,671 --> 01:15:07,702
No!

746
01:15:28,067 --> 01:15:30,902
Mother of God. Forgive me.
Mother of God.

747
01:15:32,154 --> 01:15:34,824
Forgive me for I have sinned.

748
01:15:35,074 --> 01:15:36,616
It's all right.

749
01:15:39,161 --> 01:15:42,115
I forgive you. It's all right.

750
01:16:00,516 --> 01:16:01,631
Laura!

751
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:10,521
Laura!

752
01:16:15,197 --> 01:16:16,146
Laura!

753
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:18,533
Lose something?

754
01:16:18,784 --> 01:16:20,243
She changed.

755
01:16:20,411 --> 01:16:22,569
You were wrong.
She changed!

756
01:16:22,872 --> 01:16:24,414
It was a theory.

757
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:27,000
Oh God, I hate you!

758
01:16:27,251 --> 01:16:29,623
You and your sick experiments!

759
01:16:30,671 --> 01:16:32,913
What was I thinking?

760
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:35,795
Laura was right.
You killed my sister.

761
01:16:35,968 --> 01:16:37,712
An unfortunate incident.

762
01:16:37,887 --> 01:16:39,298
Emily's no incident!

763
01:16:39,472 --> 01:16:42,093
Nothing we can do
about your sister.

764
01:16:42,767 --> 01:16:45,340
But we can still save
your girlfriend.

765
01:16:45,645 --> 01:16:46,807
Laura!

766
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:48,724
Her name is Laura!

767
01:16:49,232 --> 01:16:51,271
- Try the Death House?
- What?

768
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:53,684
Did you look in the Death House?

769
01:16:53,903 --> 01:16:56,820
If the Warden found her,
he took her there.

770
01:16:56,989 --> 01:16:59,278
The Warden? But, he's dead.

771
01:17:03,537 --> 01:17:05,364
God damn you!

772
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:09,125
Religion has got nothing
to do with this.

773
01:17:10,086 --> 01:17:10,999
In position!

774
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:13,044
Come out with your hands up.

775
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:14,912
Help me!

776
01:17:17,093 --> 01:17:19,002
Hand over your head!

777
01:17:20,429 --> 01:17:22,054
Hands over your head!

778
01:17:26,894 --> 01:17:28,721
I see the light!

779
01:17:29,605 --> 01:17:31,598
I'm saved!

780
01:17:31,899 --> 01:17:33,691
Thank you God!

781
01:17:35,194 --> 01:17:36,475
I'm saved!

782
01:17:36,654 --> 01:17:37,852
Hold your fire!

783
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:40,523
Thank you God.

784
01:17:41,784 --> 01:17:43,444
I'm hungry!

785
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:23,112
Great.

786
01:18:25,578 --> 01:18:28,283
It's great what
you did back there.

787
01:18:38,341 --> 01:18:39,669
I like you.

788
01:18:43,095 --> 01:18:44,887
I like you very much.

789
01:18:47,516 --> 01:18:48,715
0n your knees.

790
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:53,346
Would you prefer punishment?

791
01:18:55,816 --> 01:18:57,975
That's a good girl.

792
01:19:00,446 --> 01:19:02,355
Give daddy a kiss.

793
01:19:07,370 --> 01:19:08,200
Sergeant!

794
01:19:11,165 --> 01:19:12,659
Go stand guard!

795
01:19:49,996 --> 01:19:50,944
What was that?

796
01:19:57,253 --> 01:19:58,118
You bitch!

797
01:20:08,723 --> 01:20:10,133
That's Laura.

798
01:20:22,403 --> 01:20:23,518
Come on!

799
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:27,313
Your ass is mine!

800
01:21:19,794 --> 01:21:20,873
Laura!

801
01:21:37,603 --> 01:21:39,477
It's, it's in me...

802
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:42,308
it's taking over.

803
01:21:42,942 --> 01:21:45,267
You have to get it out!

804
01:21:45,444 --> 01:21:46,855
I can't.

805
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:48,565
Please.

806
01:21:49,031 --> 01:21:50,146
Please.

807
01:21:51,242 --> 01:21:55,951
Don't let it go on,
you have to kill it.

808
01:22:14,015 --> 01:22:15,425
Kill me?

809
01:22:40,082 --> 01:22:41,493
Fascinating.

810
01:22:42,251 --> 01:22:44,160
I was a piece of ass for you.

811
01:22:44,337 --> 01:22:46,163
No, never.

812
01:22:58,059 --> 01:22:59,434
This is mine.

813
01:22:59,602 --> 01:23:00,266
Fucker!

814
01:23:00,436 --> 01:23:02,393
You've been holding out on me!

815
01:23:03,981 --> 01:23:05,689
You can't keep this.

816
01:23:05,858 --> 01:23:07,815
This is awesome.

817
01:23:08,027 --> 01:23:10,269
This green shit rocks, man.

818
01:23:10,446 --> 01:23:11,442
Give it to me.

819
01:23:12,323 --> 01:23:14,446
Sorry. I can't.

820
01:23:14,617 --> 01:23:15,780
Prison rules.

821
01:23:15,952 --> 01:23:18,739
You can't share needles.
It's not safe.

822
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:21,239
Now, fuck off.
I need some privacy here.

823
01:23:21,415 --> 01:23:22,910
I wouldn't if I were you.

824
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:28,461
Fortunately, right now cabrón,

825
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:31,626
you are not, me.

826
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:26,635
Hey man!

827
01:24:26,814 --> 01:24:28,095
Got any more?

828
01:24:28,482 --> 01:24:30,060
Just another hit.

829
01:24:31,193 --> 01:24:32,604
You had enough.

830
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:34,522
How about some Vicodin?

831
01:24:34,697 --> 01:24:37,069
The little red pills. Vicodin.

832
01:24:54,425 --> 01:24:55,374
Stop!

833
01:24:57,345 --> 01:24:58,507
Howard.

834
01:25:00,723 --> 01:25:02,003
Laura?

835
01:25:02,391 --> 01:25:03,672
Howard, please!

836
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:11,500
Warden Brando, is that you?

837
01:26:34,191 --> 01:26:35,271
Where is it?

838
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:37,186
- What?
- You know what.

839
01:26:37,612 --> 01:26:39,403
Where's my work?

840
01:27:16,442 --> 01:27:19,277
That's quite enough of you.

841
01:27:19,737 --> 01:27:20,816
Ratty.

842
01:27:58,442 --> 01:28:00,649
This experiment is over.

843
01:28:11,122 --> 01:28:14,573
Please Howard.
Please stop me.

844
01:28:21,799 --> 01:28:25,464
You will be punished for this.

845
01:28:30,057 --> 01:28:31,552
You're being punished.

846
01:28:35,646 --> 01:28:36,975
Kill me, Howard.

847
01:28:50,286 --> 01:28:52,029
Go for it, Howie.

848
01:28:54,957 --> 01:28:56,202
I'm the Warden!

849
01:28:59,629 --> 01:29:01,087
Guilty as charged.

850
01:29:19,523 --> 01:29:21,148
Halt! In position now!

851
01:29:21,734 --> 01:29:22,932
Move, move, move!

852
01:29:42,547 --> 01:29:43,709
Howard?

853
01:29:46,259 --> 01:29:48,714
I had to kill her...
to get it out.

854
01:29:49,595 --> 01:29:50,793
To save her.

855
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:55,390
But I want her back.

856
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,520
It'll be all right, Emily.

857
01:30:03,192 --> 01:30:04,271
I'll take care of you.

858
01:30:25,172 --> 01:30:26,631
Hold it right there!

859
01:30:30,511 --> 01:30:31,709
You okay?

860
01:30:35,433 --> 01:30:36,298
She's alright.

861
01:30:39,937 --> 01:30:41,348
I gave her life.

862
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:51,694
Halt!

863
01:30:52,575 --> 01:30:55,695
This man is critical.
I need to get him to hospital!

864
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,740
- Who are you?
- Doctor Phillips.

865
01:30:58,915 --> 01:31:01,037
I run the infirmary.
Who are you?

866
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:03,000
Who's responsible if hedies?

867
01:31:04,045 --> 01:31:05,207
Okay, go! Go!

868
01:31:09,175 --> 01:31:11,582
Dubious... dubious.

869
01:31:20,353 --> 01:31:21,467
Hey! Take him.

870
01:31:27,318 --> 01:31:28,563
I saved her.

871
01:31:29,278 --> 01:31:30,192
Tell him.

872
01:31:30,363 --> 01:31:32,023
Tell him I saved you!

873
01:31:33,699 --> 01:31:34,814
Emily?

874
01:31:36,285 --> 01:31:37,032
Laura?

875
01:31:38,579 --> 01:31:39,658
Emily?

876
01:31:41,499 --> 01:31:42,613
Laura?

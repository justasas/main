1
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,387
Dr. Gruber!

2
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:37,422
<i>Doctor!

3
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:40,416
<i>Mr. West!

4
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,504
<i>Mr. West!

5
00:00:45,544 --> 00:00:46,839
<i>Get out!

6
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:50,091
<i>Now?

7
00:00:50,102 --> 00:00:51,591
<i>Yes.

8
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:52,802
<i>Move back.

9
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:09,455
My God.

10
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,834
You idiots!
You'll ruin my notes.

11
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:17,659
I have to record
his vital signs!

12
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:19,587
No!

13
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,114
Dr. Gruber?

14
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,336
<i>Dr. Gruber, how are you?

15
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:31,752
Dr. Gruber?

16
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,819
<i>He's dead.

17
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,999
Of course, he's dead,
the dosage was too large.

18
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,001
You killed him.

19
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:56,320
No, I did not.

20
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,709
I gave him life.

21
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,803
Alright,
I'm gonna zap her again.

22
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,917
Charge up the paddles.

23
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,601
- Come on, let's go! Let's go!
- Sorry, doctor.

24
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,929
Hold the compressions.

25
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:04,452
Clear!

26
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:10,738
Straight line.

27
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:14,650
Alright, let's call it.

28
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:16,923
Cain.

29
00:05:17,128 --> 00:05:19,762
She just needs a little more time
for the drugs to circulate.

30
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,027
Cain, we have done everything
that can be done for this woman.

31
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,005
She has not responded.

32
00:05:28,957 --> 00:05:30,198
She's gone!

33
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:44,031
Cain, your optimism is touching,
but a waste of time.

34
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,584
A good doctor
knows when to stop.

35
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,252
- Dr. Harrod, just--
- Take her.

36
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,226
And take her to the morgue.

37
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,898
Gangway.

38
00:05:59,573 --> 00:06:01,026
- How you doing?
- Alright.

39
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,533
Mr. Cain.

40
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:07,868
Hey, Mace.

41
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,203
I got another one for you.

42
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,724
They ain't locked.
Doc Hill's in the autopsy room.

43
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:13,753
Oh, thanks.

44
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,045
Don't know why they keep
locked doors around here.

45
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,254
Nobody wants in...

46
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,133
and ain't nobody gettin' out.

47
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,435
Heh...

48
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:23,687
Yup.

49
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,315
Oh, full house.

50
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,219
Oh, I'm sorry, Dan.
I didn't mean to scare you.

51
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,717
Oh, it wasn't too bad
Dean Halsey.

52
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:55,100
I just didn't know anybody was here.

53
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,996
You mean, "anybody else."

54
00:07:57,152 --> 00:07:58,519
Dan, this is Herbert West.

55
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,355
He'll be joining you
in your third year.

56
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,388
He was doing independent
research in Switzerland

57
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,193
with Dr. Gruber shortly before he died.

58
00:08:04,276 --> 00:08:06,439
Mr. West, this is Daniel Cain.

59
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,144
One of Miskatonic Medical's

60
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,719
best young hopes
for the future of medicine.

61
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,784
What were you researching?

62
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:13,894
Death.

63
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:17,188
Oh, Alan, we don't see you
around here much anymore.

64
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, I was just showing
our newest student,

65
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,335
Herbert West here,
the not-so-grand tour.

66
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,295
This should interest you, Carl.

67
00:08:23,315 --> 00:08:25,490
He worked with Hans Gruber.

68
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,519
Ah, Mr. West?

69
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,567
This is our eminent brain researcher
and grant machine, Dr. Carl Hill.

70
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,517
I know your work, Dr. Hill.

71
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,604
Quite well.

72
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,812
Your theory on the location
of the will in the brain is...

73
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,190
interesting.

74
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,735
Though derivative of Dr. Gruber's
research in the early '70s.

75
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,950
So derivative, in fact, that in Europe
it's considered plagiarized.

76
00:08:50,513 --> 00:08:54,083
And your support of the 12-minute limit on
the life of the brain stem after death--

77
00:08:54,094 --> 00:08:57,079
6 to 12 minutes, Mr. ah...

78
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,465
West. Herbert West.

79
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,871
Frankly, Dr. uh, Hill?

80
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,976
Your work on brain death
is outdated.

81
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,801
Uh, Carl, while I remember,

82
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,289
we're having a grant committee
meeting Thursday.

83
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,014
Megan and I would love it
if you came to dinner.

84
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,560
Well, I'd love to, Alan,
looking forward to it.

85
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:23,106
And looking forward to
seeing you in class, Mr. West.

86
00:09:32,926 --> 00:09:36,327
Uh, Dean Halsey, I don't know if this
is the right time, but I've been so busy--

87
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,190
No, this is the perfect time.
What is it?

88
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:41,363
I wondered if you could write me
a letter of recommendation,

89
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:44,171
for the...
Wellman Scholarship.

90
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,957
Oh absolutely.

91
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,378
Of course.

92
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,643
I was going to suggest
that you applied.

93
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:51,414
It's a very prestigious scholarship, Dan.

94
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,091
It'll do good things for your career.

95
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,438
- Thank you sir.
- Mr. West.

96
00:09:54,685 --> 00:09:56,258
I'll take you to Pathology.

97
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,633
Good.

98
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:24,329
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,347
No.

100
00:10:29,692 --> 00:10:30,669
No.

101
00:10:30,724 --> 00:10:31,884
No!

102
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,259
Oh yeah!

103
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,658
Oh!

104
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,875
I'm dead.

105
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:02,580
You work too much Dan.

106
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:09,161
Well, I can go to medical school
and find out more.

107
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:12,501
- Rufus.
- Hi Rufus.

108
00:11:12,684 --> 00:11:13,988
Hi.

109
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,057
Hi baby.

110
00:11:15,153 --> 00:11:17,023
Where have you been boy?

111
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:19,079
Yeah. Usually,
you're always bothering us.

112
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,049
Yeah, he likes his new home.

113
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,810
Lots of new corners
and closets to hide in.

114
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,858
I hadn't seen him all day yesterday.

115
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,125
Get out of here. C'mon.

116
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,865
It's a nice place Dan.
I really like it.

117
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:32,855
Yeah?

118
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:33,893
Yeah.

119
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:36,068
So why don't you move in with me?

120
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,941
Please don't start.
You know I can't.

121
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,867
You know...

122
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,717
its alright for two people
who love each other...

123
00:11:47,111 --> 00:11:48,244
to live together.

124
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:49,588
Yeah, I know.

125
00:11:49,907 --> 00:11:50,964
But not me.

126
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:54,353
And especially not with one
of Daddy's students. Okay?

127
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:59,150
I'm not sure, but I think that
violates one of my civil rights.

128
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,252
You'll find a roommate.

129
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:03,483
Well, I better.

130
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,217
I can't afford this place by myself.

131
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,440
You know any eligible nurses?

132
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,825
Hey! That's not fair!

133
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,368
Uh...

134
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,271
Oh.

135
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,247
- Don't.
- Hey. You have a beautiful body.

136
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,914
- You do.
- Yeah?

137
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,487
So, I'm not sure that's a compliment.

138
00:12:29,796 --> 00:12:33,182
Coming from someone who spends
most of his time with cadavers.

139
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,038
Hey. "Dead bodies" as "Cadaver."

140
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:39,722
Aren't beautiful.

141
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:41,860
Besides, you know...

142
00:12:42,225 --> 00:12:43,869
they just don't jump...

143
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:46,091
when you tickle!

144
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:47,974
Dan, don't! I hate that!

145
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,256
Stop.

146
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:51,473
Don't!
Don't tickle me!

147
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,000
- He-he... Stop!
- Okay.

148
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,355
Oh.

149
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,432
Oh, Rufus.

150
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:07,225
- I have to go.
- Thanks a lot.

151
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:12,351
Stay.

152
00:13:12,837 --> 00:13:15,838
- Daddy knows I'm here.
- I don't care what Dean Halsey knows.

153
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,024
Well, you should care.
For his sake, mine and yours--

154
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:21,719
I want you again.

155
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,497
- Now.
- Be reasonable.

156
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:27,089
If I didn't come home
one night...

157
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,838
just one night...

158
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,540
What would he do?

159
00:13:30,697 --> 00:13:32,196
Expel me?

160
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,681
He has too much integrity for that.

161
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,904
He likes you,
you know.

162
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,767
I like him.

163
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,918
He's out of touch with the times.

164
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:43,444
That's just the way he is.

165
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,910
The world's last living Puritan.

166
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,717
I really hate it.

167
00:13:58,974 --> 00:14:00,882
I love you.

168
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,606
Marry me.

169
00:14:14,348 --> 00:14:15,483
Dan--

170
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,987
It's a perfect solution.
It solves all our problems.

171
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,490
Solving your rent problems.

172
00:14:19,514 --> 00:14:22,081
It's hardly a firm basis for a marriage.

173
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,485
Besides...

174
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:25,455
Daddy wouldn't allow it.

175
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,659
What does he want me to do?

176
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,782
Whatever it is,
I'll do it.

177
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,372
Graduate.

178
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:37,705
The day that you graduate,

179
00:14:37,788 --> 00:14:40,853
the minute you get your M.D.,
I'll marry you,

180
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,884
and I'll help you, and I'll be with you

181
00:14:45,171 --> 00:14:47,718
as much as I can until then.

182
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:49,623
I promise.

183
00:14:51,302 --> 00:14:53,140
Back to square one.

184
00:14:53,638 --> 00:14:57,479
Well, at least it gives me
a chance to housebreak you.

185
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:01,176
Housebroken, is it?

186
00:15:06,943 --> 00:15:09,919
I'm going to have to teach
you a lesson, my girl.

187
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,367
What are you doing?

188
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:12,778
Yeaaaow!

189
00:15:12,813 --> 00:15:15,169
Dan!

190
00:15:16,202 --> 00:15:18,933
Dan, stop! Don't!

191
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:23,175
- Dan, stop it!
- Come, my pretty.

192
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:24,936
Dan, I don't like that!

193
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:25,951
Don't!

194
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,415
- There's not a jury in the world...
- Stop!

195
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,070
that would convict me!

196
00:15:30,091 --> 00:15:31,759
Dan, stop it!

197
00:15:31,811 --> 00:15:33,405
Doctor Dan!

198
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:36,529
Dan, don't, come on, stop!

199
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,693
- I'm going! I have to go!
- Come here! Come to me.

200
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:41,821
- Oh.
- What?

201
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:45,364
Oh, shit.

202
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:47,159
Hi.

203
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:48,540
Can I help you?

204
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:52,075
You're
here about the apartment.

205
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:53,375
Yes.

206
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,918
Didn't we meet this morning?
You're...

207
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:58,105
West. Herbert West.

208
00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:00,854
Excuse me just one sec.

209
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:06,270
- Come in.
- Thank you.

210
00:16:12,393 --> 00:16:13,644
I startled you.

211
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:15,680
- Yes, you did.
- Hmm.

212
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:21,318
May I introduce my fiancée,
Megan Halsey?

213
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:24,302
- Miss Halsey.
- Mr. West.

214
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:27,210
I'm afraid the place is still
kind of a mess, Mr. West.

215
00:16:27,265 --> 00:16:29,243
Oh... Herbert.

216
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,798
So, you've
just come from Europe?

217
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,669
Switzerland.

218
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:47,720
What was Dr. Gruber like?
He was pretty famous.

219
00:16:47,803 --> 00:16:49,346
Yes, pretty famous...

220
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,974
Does this building
have a basement?

221
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,104
Oh, yes.

222
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,525
Yes.

223
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:07,281
I think this will be just fine.

224
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,820
I have my things outside,
shall I move in now?

225
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,265
Look, I have to go.

226
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,437
I think you and Mr. West
have a lot to discuss

227
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:16,816
before you decide anything.

228
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,938
Oh, I've decided.

229
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:20,594
Well, I'd like--

230
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,853
You know, you'll never even
know that I'm here.

231
00:17:22,884 --> 00:17:23,814
Dan, I--

232
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:25,296
Except, of course,
on the first of the month.

233
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,717
Mr. West?

234
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,093
Miss Halsey?

235
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:31,148
You didn't say why
you left Switzerland.

236
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:36,646
There was no more
I could learn there.

237
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,024
Do we... have a deal?

238
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,114
Done.

239
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,002
Done.

240
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:57,383
You make the incision
at the base of the skull...

241
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:13,974
cutting away
enough of the faschia...

242
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:18,981
to get your fingers in...

243
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:26,037
and then grasping firmly
with both hands,

244
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,209
you pull the skin forward
over the head.

245
00:18:32,335 --> 00:18:34,975
It is very much like
peeling a large orange.

246
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:41,291
Once the skull is plainly visible,

247
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,048
you take the bone saw...

248
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:49,545
and you cut around the perimeter.

249
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,188
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

250
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,120
the human brain.

251
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:11,060
Once the brain stem
of an individual,

252
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:14,001
I'm talking about the reticular
activating system,

253
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,629
heart regulation,
respiratory center.

254
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,173
Once these activities cease,

255
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:23,845
the brain can only survive
an additional 6 to 12 minutes.

256
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,393
6 to 12 minutes.

257
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,372
Until...

258
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:37,191
brain death brings about
an irreversible conclusion.

259
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:49,870
We all want to retain
our personalities

260
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,123
in some idyllic afterlife.

261
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:55,042
We all pray for some miracle,

262
00:19:55,126 --> 00:19:57,360
some drug,

263
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,705
potion, pill.

264
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:06,542
Perhaps, though...

265
00:20:07,397 --> 00:20:09,499
it takes something else.

266
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:14,020
Perhaps it takes desire,
an obsessive desire.

267
00:20:14,103 --> 00:20:15,924
Perhaps it ta--

268
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:26,198
We will discuss the location of the will
in the brain structure

269
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,693
at another time.

270
00:20:29,702 --> 00:20:31,318
Mr. West!

271
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,015
I suggest you get
yourself a pen!

272
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:38,461
Class dismissed.

273
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:42,548
How can you teach such drivel?

274
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:44,592
These people are here to learn
and you're closing their minds

275
00:20:44,675 --> 00:20:45,843
before they even have a chance!

276
00:20:45,926 --> 00:20:47,345
What are you here for,
Mr. West?

277
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,347
You know, you should have
stolen more of Gruber's ideas,

278
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:50,765
then at least you'd have ideas!

279
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,432
Mr. West!

280
00:20:55,603 --> 00:20:58,481
It is gonna be
a pleasure to fail you.

281
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:09,567
I would like to propose a toast

282
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:11,911
to the National Science Foundation

283
00:21:11,994 --> 00:21:16,026
for recognizing the genius
of Dr. Carl Hill,

284
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:20,378
and for awarding
Miskatonic Medical School

285
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,004
its largest grant ever.

286
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:27,206
Your new laser drill is gonna
revolutionize neurosurgery.

287
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:31,414
To the Foundation,
and to Miskatonic.

288
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:37,186
It's alright, sweetheart,
you can drink up.

289
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:38,312
We're celebrating.

290
00:21:38,396 --> 00:21:40,481
I know, Daddy,
but I have to go soon.

291
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:44,276
After preparing such a feast?
You must be tired.

292
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:46,028
I have a study date.

293
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,488
With Daniel?

294
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,156
Yeah.

295
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,491
Daniel Cain?

296
00:21:50,624 --> 00:21:51,741
Mm-hm.

297
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:54,954
Herbert West has moved in
with him, hasn't he?

298
00:21:55,037 --> 00:21:56,705
For the time being.

299
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:59,530
That must be him. Excuse me.

300
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:06,757
So, your daughter
is seeing Cain, eh?

301
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:11,092
You think that's wise, Alan?

302
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,805
Dan!

303
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:14,261
Hello, sir.

304
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:15,470
Dr. Hill.

305
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,310
Would you join us
for a glass of wine?

306
00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:22,064
Actually, we have some
work to do.

307
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:23,607
Why don't you study here?

308
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:26,724
Well, I'll have her home soon,
don't worry.

309
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:30,656
Well then...
one last toast.

310
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,869
To Megan...

311
00:22:34,952 --> 00:22:38,998
my esteemed colleague's capable,

312
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:41,961
beautiful, loving daughter,

313
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:45,796
the obsession of all
who fall under her spell.

314
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,470
- I'll drink to that.
- Here, here!

315
00:22:58,054 --> 00:22:59,874
Are you sure,
you won't stay with us?

316
00:22:59,913 --> 00:23:01,937
We promise not to be too boring.

317
00:23:02,904 --> 00:23:05,214
And you do look tired, my dear.

318
00:23:06,146 --> 00:23:08,189
Very tired.

319
00:23:11,972 --> 00:23:14,740
Um, no. That's okay, um...

320
00:23:14,918 --> 00:23:17,038
you two have a good time.

321
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,832
Bye, Daddy.

322
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:21,291
- Now don't be too late.
- Okay.

323
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,699
I'll see you soon.
Dr. Hill...

324
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:26,578
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

325
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,301
How 'bout some brandy?

326
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:36,002
Your daughter has grown into
an enchanting young woman.

327
00:23:36,044 --> 00:23:37,752
Oh, yes she has.

328
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:43,259
You know,
since Maryanne died...

329
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:47,381
she's taken care of the house,
the cooking and me.

330
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,684
It'll be a shame when she leaves.

331
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,405
She deserves the best, Alan.

332
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:58,695
Someone...
clearly superior.

333
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,360
Oh, give the boy a chance.

334
00:24:01,762 --> 00:24:04,034
He's a very good scholar.

335
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,657
He needs our help, Carl.

336
00:24:08,705 --> 00:24:10,925
He deserves our Wellman Scholarship.

337
00:24:11,072 --> 00:24:12,843
Oh, I don't know, Alan.

338
00:24:12,892 --> 00:24:14,064
Perhaps.

339
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,685
But I can't help wondering...

340
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:21,174
is he morally fit, to be a doctor?

341
00:24:22,736 --> 00:24:24,302
What do you mean?

342
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:26,431
Well, as you said...

343
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,606
he's a clever young man.

344
00:24:28,964 --> 00:24:32,089
He knows full well,
he's dating the Dean's daughter.

345
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,895
He could be using her,
to gain an advantage with you.

346
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,787
I suspected the same thing,
in the beginning.

347
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:42,663
He's proven himself
to be a perfect gentleman.

348
00:24:42,697 --> 00:24:44,238
Oh, of course.

349
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:46,655
But after he gets the scholarship...

350
00:24:46,947 --> 00:24:48,745
he won't need her then.

351
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,209
I don't believe that.

352
00:24:53,114 --> 00:24:54,667
I trust him.

353
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,145
Meg, trusts him.

354
00:24:56,588 --> 00:25:00,996
Meg has matured a great deal,
in the past few years.

355
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:03,106
But she's still young...

356
00:25:03,238 --> 00:25:05,113
and impressionable.

357
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:11,181
And now Cain is rooming
with that West character.

358
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:15,376
West, is a strange bird,
I'll grant you that.

359
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:18,314
He's a cancer, Alan.

360
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,980
His intelligence
is highly questionable.

361
00:25:25,087 --> 00:25:27,123
He's disrespectful...

362
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,623
tells lies about the staff.

363
00:25:30,884 --> 00:25:33,150
I think he's deranged.

364
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:35,430
Dangerous.

365
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:38,312
Dangerous?

366
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:40,002
Yes, Alan.

367
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,978
And Cain is with him,
all the time.

368
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:46,378
And with your daughter.

369
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:51,017
Cain, is dangerous.

370
00:25:51,222 --> 00:25:52,714
He's dangerous.

371
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:54,737
To the school...

372
00:25:55,446 --> 00:25:58,105
and to your daughter.

373
00:25:59,106 --> 00:26:00,648
Your beautiful...

374
00:26:00,746 --> 00:26:02,105
young...

375
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,860
loving, daughter.

376
00:26:05,453 --> 00:26:07,152
Dangerous.

377
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,283
My God.

378
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,465
What is it?

379
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:31,283
It's nothing.

380
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,394
What's the matter?

381
00:26:36,582 --> 00:26:37,982
Nothing.

382
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,731
He's not here,
you know.

383
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,983
He's still on shift,
at the hospital.

384
00:26:45,715 --> 00:26:48,086
- It's not West.
- No?

385
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,904
You know, ever since he moved in,
you come over less and less.

386
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:55,581
And when you do,
you're in a case of repressed hysteria.

387
00:26:56,772 --> 00:26:59,834
I'm sorry, Danny.
But he makes my skin crawl.

388
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:03,506
Well, he's just
one of your typical geniuses.

389
00:27:03,963 --> 00:27:05,379
He's, um...

390
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,705
he's very intelligent,
he's very private.

391
00:27:07,736 --> 00:27:09,796
Doesn't quite act like other people.

392
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,366
But he-- but he's been
no problem, really.

393
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,387
Yeah.

394
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:33,957
No, Dan.

395
00:27:34,292 --> 00:27:35,607
No.

396
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,284
Please!

397
00:27:39,976 --> 00:27:41,412
Okay, what is it?

398
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:42,855
I don't know.

399
00:27:43,551 --> 00:27:45,848
Look, it's not you, really.

400
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:48,496
It's just a lot of little things.

401
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:49,581
Like what?

402
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,703
Well, West is always in his room
with the door closed.

403
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:54,746
I mean, do you ever see him?

404
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,331
Does he ever eat?

405
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:59,219
I told you, he's a little cracked.

406
00:28:00,794 --> 00:28:02,846
He bothers you, too.

407
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:05,644
No, don't be ridiculous.

408
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:07,399
Rufus is terrified of him.

409
00:28:07,448 --> 00:28:09,182
When West comes in,
he runs and hides.

410
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:10,971
Rufus hides
and runs all the time,

411
00:28:10,991 --> 00:28:13,327
- it's standard cat activity.
- Yes, but not when we're together,

412
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,475
then he's all over us trying
to get your attention and...

413
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:18,223
Where is he?

414
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:20,009
I haven't seen him
since we got here.

415
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:21,356
It's okay, he's around here.

416
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:22,485
I haven't even heard him,

417
00:28:22,524 --> 00:28:25,386
usually he at least knocks
something over when I'm here.

418
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:29,631
Pss pss pss pss.

419
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:34,135
Rufus... Rufus... Rufus.

420
00:28:34,219 --> 00:28:35,345
Pss pss pss pss.

421
00:28:35,428 --> 00:28:37,553
Come on, you fat cat.

422
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,600
Here, kitty!

423
00:28:40,683 --> 00:28:42,109
Rufus.

424
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:44,273
Come on now, you mad animal.

425
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:46,856
Don't you try to hide from me.

426
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,400
- Rufus.
- I know all of your tricks.

427
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:52,403
Rufus? Where are you, boy?

428
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:54,153
Here, kitty.
<i> 

429
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:55,960
Here, kitty.

430
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:57,789
Pss pss pss pss.

431
00:28:58,243 --> 00:28:59,660
Here, kitty.

432
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:04,117
Pss pss pss pss.

433
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:07,706
Rufus. Hey, boy!

434
00:29:08,735 --> 00:29:10,329
Pss pss pss pss.

435
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:21,681
Rufus?

436
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,617
Rufus?

437
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,480
Rufus.

438
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:40,241
Rufus?

439
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,950
Pss pss pss pss.

440
00:29:49,335 --> 00:29:50,703
Come here.

441
00:29:57,552 --> 00:29:59,637
Rufus, are you in here?

442
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,276
Here, boy.

443
00:30:07,603 --> 00:30:09,017
Here, kitty.

444
00:30:09,478 --> 00:30:11,401
Pss pss pss pss.

445
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:23,254
Rufus?

446
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:33,129
Oh, Dan, I think it's...

447
00:30:33,212 --> 00:30:34,839
What are you doing in my room?

448
00:30:34,922 --> 00:30:36,341
- How dare you come in...
- Dan!

449
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:37,887
Dan!

450
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,113
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

451
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:42,632
I thought I was renting
a private room, Dan!

452
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:44,227
Meg, what the hell
are you doing in here?

453
00:30:44,282 --> 00:30:46,110
- I--
- Would you please leave, now!

454
00:30:46,165 --> 00:30:47,392
Easy, Herbert!

455
00:30:47,735 --> 00:30:49,665
- Come on--
- In the fridge!

456
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:52,929
My God.

457
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:01,770
I was going to show you.

458
00:31:02,315 --> 00:31:03,856
Shut up.

459
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,284
What happened?

460
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,966
It was dead when I found it.

461
00:31:13,824 --> 00:31:15,580
You killed him.

462
00:31:15,635 --> 00:31:17,091
He hated you!

463
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:20,181
Meg. It suffocated.

464
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:27,441
It knocked the garbage over and
it got its head stuck in a jar.

465
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,552
You weren't home,
so I put it in there.

466
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,285
I certainly didn't think
you'd want to find it like that.

467
00:31:31,334 --> 00:31:33,215
I didn't want
to stink the place up.

468
00:31:33,343 --> 00:31:34,829
I was going to show you.

469
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,972
You couldn't call, or write a note?

470
00:31:37,055 --> 00:31:39,099
I was busy pushing bodies around,
as you well know,

471
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:40,476
and what would a note say, Dan?

472
00:31:40,517 --> 00:31:42,782
"Cat dead, details later"?

473
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,038
I knew you were fond of it.

474
00:31:44,086 --> 00:31:46,258
You killed him, I know you did.
He killed him!

475
00:31:46,287 --> 00:31:47,983
Besides, I do not
like people in my room!

476
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,706
Alright, that's enough.

477
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,328
I think you both better leave, now.

478
00:31:59,411 --> 00:32:01,551
- What the hell is this?
- That is none of your business.

479
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:03,489
- Yeah, I think it is my business!
- Just as it is none of my business

480
00:32:03,544 --> 00:32:06,044
that you're sleeping
with Dean Halsey's daughter.

481
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:10,672
You know, I would not want
to see a fellow student,

482
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:12,508
especially one
as promising as yourself,

483
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,885
be thrown out of school,
out of the profession...

484
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:17,269
on moral ground.

485
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,446
I think Dr. Halsey
just might understand.

486
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,904
Oh, do you?

487
00:32:22,518 --> 00:32:24,357
Well, you may well be right.

488
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,452
Are you sure you want
to find out?

489
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,202
Dan!
Dan, he's right.

490
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:35,786
It's your life!
You know how Daddy is.

491
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,937
He could kill your scholarship.

492
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,997
Dear, diluted,
little Danny.

493
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:43,708
So much he doesn't know.
Isn't there?

494
00:32:43,763 --> 00:32:46,050
Come on, Dan.
Let's get out of here.

495
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,174
Dan.

496
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:01,192
Garbage to garbage.

497
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:05,495
I want him out of here tonight!

498
00:33:05,523 --> 00:33:07,239
No, Dan.
We need more on him.

499
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:09,125
I'll check Daddy's files.

500
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:56,204
Herbert.

501
00:33:57,205 --> 00:33:58,291
Herbert.

502
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,291
Herbert!

503
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,095
You hear that sound?

504
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,588
West! West!

505
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,217
West, what is that?

506
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:25,497
Whoa!

507
00:34:36,536 --> 00:34:38,162
Get off of...

508
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:39,749
Cain!

509
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:44,465
Get out of here!

510
00:34:49,424 --> 00:34:50,746
Get it off of me!

511
00:34:58,283 --> 00:35:00,953
- What the hell is it?!
- Later! Later!

512
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:07,650
Aw, shit.

513
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,695
There he is! Shit.

514
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:19,947
Don't move.

515
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,886
Look out!

516
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,957
There it goes under the stairs,
it's under the stairs.

517
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:38,904
Okay, I got it.

518
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,195
I got it.

519
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,677
How?

520
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,206
Look out!

521
00:36:34,766 --> 00:36:37,148
I don't know, I--
I can't seem to focus.

522
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,915
It is really quite simple.

523
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:41,805
All life is a physical
and chemical process, correct?

524
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:45,620
It stands to reason then, that if one
could find extremely fresh specimens

525
00:36:45,674 --> 00:36:49,355
and recharge that chemical process,
bang, we have re-animation.

526
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:53,297
- The theory is not new, West.
- But my reagent is.

527
00:36:54,109 --> 00:36:55,471
Read.

528
00:36:59,578 --> 00:37:01,246
"With various animating solutions,"

529
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:03,040
"I have killed and brought
to animated life,"

530
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:07,370
"a number of rabbits,
guinea pigs, cats, and dogs."

531
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:09,780
I've broken the 6 to 12 minute barrier.

532
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:11,581
I've conquered brain death.

533
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,451
"With the higher animals
and the consequent"

534
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:20,825
increased strength of solution,
reaction has become more violent...

535
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:24,253
and my research
has become more difficult.

536
00:37:24,337 --> 00:37:26,679
Which is why
I need you to help me.

537
00:37:27,757 --> 00:37:28,758
Help you?

538
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:31,093
You are the perfect person
to assist me.

539
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:34,096
You're hard-working, bright,
people respect you,

540
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,799
and you have access
to certain authorities.

541
00:37:39,122 --> 00:37:41,689
We can defeat death.

542
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,066
We can achieve
every doctor's dream.

543
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:48,657
You'll be famous... and live lifetimes.

544
00:37:49,009 --> 00:37:51,401
You haven't done this on people?

545
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:58,829
I've done all I can here.

546
00:37:58,955 --> 00:38:01,201
I'll need new lab space.

547
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,135
You will help me.

548
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,034
- No!
- Why? Because it's mad?

549
00:38:07,142 --> 00:38:08,883
No, because I don't
believe you.

550
00:38:08,962 --> 00:38:10,776
How can you say that?
You've seen the results.

551
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,885
No, Rufus wasn't dead
to begin with.

552
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:14,637
You drugged him
and reduced his vital signs.

553
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,775
You lowered his body temperature.
He couldn't have been dead.

554
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:18,411
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

555
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:21,727
Do you agree
that he's dead now?

556
00:38:29,735 --> 00:38:31,405
West, no!

557
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:37,451
West, stop!

558
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:39,025
I'll show you.

559
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,372
- Then you'll help me.
- No!

560
00:38:41,455 --> 00:38:42,581
Yes, you will.

561
00:38:42,665 --> 00:38:46,252
That is why I brought the infernal beast
back to life in the first place.

562
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:53,884
- In the brain?
- Of course.

563
00:38:58,055 --> 00:39:01,711
Don't expect it to tango,
it has a broken back.

564
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:10,219
God! Why does
it make that noise?

565
00:39:11,277 --> 00:39:13,601
Birth is always painful.

566
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:20,008
It was dead.

567
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,430
Twice.

568
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,209
- Oh, it's him!
- Baby, what are you doing here?

569
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:29,045
It's Rufus! How did...

570
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:31,881
- Come on, let's go upstairs.
- Oh! Oh, my God.

571
00:39:37,018 --> 00:39:39,275
God! It's morning already.

572
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:41,455
- Dan! What happened?
- It was incredible!

573
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:43,512
No, I mean,
it was an incredible experiment!

574
00:39:43,572 --> 00:39:46,156
Herbert West
 has overcome physical death!

575
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:47,450
West?

576
00:39:47,505 --> 00:39:49,373
Dan, that's why I came.

577
00:39:49,419 --> 00:39:51,380
I-- I tried to call.
But no one answered.

578
00:39:51,419 --> 00:39:54,559
I was so worried.
As soon as I could get out, I came.

579
00:39:55,175 --> 00:39:57,565
I went through
Daddy's files last night.

580
00:39:57,612 --> 00:40:00,784
When Wests' professor
Dr. Gruber in Switzerland died.

581
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:03,289
Well, for hours afterwards, West...

582
00:40:04,432 --> 00:40:06,577
did things to the body.

583
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:08,799
The police had to tear him away.

584
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,590
He was in psychiatric observation for months.

585
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:13,160
I tried to save him.

586
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:15,949
- Now, you'll tell Halsey?
- Damn right, we'll tell him!

587
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,202
And you'll be outta here so fast,
your head will spin!

588
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:20,211
Meg, you know,
let me talk to your father.

589
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:22,016
I'll tell him.

590
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:28,063
Dan.

591
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:30,231
I think we should have a little talk.

592
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,467
Yes sir.

593
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:34,849
You think it's wise,
doing what you're doing?

594
00:40:35,548 --> 00:40:36,611
What?

595
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,859
Dating the Dean's daughter.

596
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:40,993
Sir...

597
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:43,328
I have something very important
I need to discuss with you.

598
00:40:43,375 --> 00:40:45,002
Yes, I've been expecting that.

599
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:46,977
It's the scholarship.
Right?

600
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:51,282
Herbert West has effected
re-animation in dead animal tissue.

601
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,161
Mr. Cain...

602
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,779
- I'm surprised.
- No, I-- I've seen it.

603
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:02,754
He brought back a dead animal,
a cat, back to life.

604
00:41:02,837 --> 00:41:05,840
I hadn't expected such nonsense
from you, Mr. Cain,

605
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,801
but I should have guessed it
when you took up with Mr. West.

606
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:12,234
I know he's unstable,
but I've seen the results,

607
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:13,901
and so has your daughter.

608
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:16,693
What have you been doing
with my daughter?

609
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:18,992
She walked into an experiment.

610
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,087
You've involved Megan
in your insanity?

611
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,399
I never intended to involve her.

612
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:27,255
Tomorrow morning, you will
submit to me a written apology

613
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,978
for this entire affair.

614
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:32,659
These experiments were clearly beyond
the scope of your legitimate studies.

615
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:36,079
They've obviously interfered with
your ability to do your class work.

616
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:40,708
If any equipment from the hospital
or from the laboratories

617
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:44,295
of Miskatonic University were involved
in any of this unauthorized activity,

618
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:46,256
criminal charges
may be pressed.

619
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:49,968
You will, in any case, have
your student loan rescinded.

620
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,269
My loan?

621
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:57,308
I won't be able to continue school.

622
00:41:57,434 --> 00:41:59,853
As for Mr. West,
he needs submit no apology.

623
00:41:59,936 --> 00:42:03,314
You may tell him that he may
continue with his research

624
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,608
without the impediment
of an education.

625
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,486
As of now, he is no longer
a student of this university.

626
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:11,614
Sir, can we please just discuss this?

627
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:13,950
I think you're being blinded
by your emotions.

628
00:42:14,718 --> 00:42:16,904
That will be all, Mr. Cain.

629
00:42:25,897 --> 00:42:27,672
Don't take this out on Meg.

630
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:30,633
She tried to stop me.

631
00:42:30,717 --> 00:42:33,290
I said that will be all.

632
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,237
I'll talk to him.

633
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:42,731
It won't do any good.

634
00:42:42,778 --> 00:42:44,273
He listens to me.

635
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:46,827
- I've gotta talk to West.
- You've got to avoid him.

636
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:48,694
Daddy's angry now.

637
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:50,941
But he'll listen to me.
He likes you. He always has.

638
00:42:50,973 --> 00:42:52,934
But you've got to
separate yourself from West.

639
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:53,996
Meg...

640
00:42:54,043 --> 00:42:56,213
don't you understand what he's done?

641
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:57,803
What we could do?

642
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,669
Well, what about what we could do?

643
00:43:03,682 --> 00:43:05,250
I love you.

644
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,231
I love you, too.

645
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:15,566
And I accept.

646
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,097
What?

647
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:21,019
I accept your proposal.

648
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:23,372
Let's get married.

649
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:25,160
- Your father--
- It's perfect. Don't you see?

650
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,700
Daddy will have to
come around eventually.

651
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:28,957
And West won't have
anything to hold over us.

652
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,111
And we'll be together.

653
00:43:30,145 --> 00:43:32,067
- Okay, I just have to talk to West first--
- No!

654
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:33,546
Dan, don't!

655
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,690
I'll get a job, 'til this blows over.

656
00:43:35,729 --> 00:43:38,543
You keep your job driving.
Daddy will see that we're serious.

657
00:43:38,596 --> 00:43:39,672
Yes.

658
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,218
Daddy will see that we're serious.

659
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:43,674
- West--
- You still don't believe

660
00:43:43,706 --> 00:43:45,284
what you saw this morning.
Do you Miss Halsey?

661
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:46,380
Dan, come with me.

662
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,282
West, we've been thrown out of school.
He's threatened to call the police.

663
00:43:49,379 --> 00:43:50,743
Oh, yes?

664
00:43:52,226 --> 00:43:55,221
Curious...
He didn't seem such a fool.

665
00:43:56,538 --> 00:43:58,701
He must have been talking to Hill.

666
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:01,519
You're right.

667
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,306
He was different.
He was angry from the start.

668
00:44:03,345 --> 00:44:05,251
He'll roll on you!
He doesn't care about anything

669
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,228
except his own crazy ideas!

670
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,989
- Can't you see that?!
- Meg...

671
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,359
He's right!
Your father's wrong!

672
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,865
Okay--okay,
now, what do we do now?

673
00:44:15,926 --> 00:44:18,160
- We prove it to him.
- Danny, listen to me!

674
00:44:18,218 --> 00:44:19,764
- It's the only way, Danny.
- I'll tell Daddy that

675
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,670
you plan to go home
with the experiments.

676
00:44:21,718 --> 00:44:22,962
- I'll tell him.
- Please do.

677
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:24,366
A-- and tell Dr. Hill, too.

678
00:44:24,406 --> 00:44:26,452
Dan, please!
Please come with me!

679
00:44:26,492 --> 00:44:28,312
He is a maniac!
He may even be a murderer!

680
00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:29,648
- Meg!
- You're in danger!

681
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,968
Meg...
we can save millions of lives!

682
00:44:32,015 --> 00:44:34,844
Oh, yes.
We could save everyone’s life.

683
00:44:38,195 --> 00:44:39,687
Okay, we need--
we need the lab animal.

684
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:42,856
I'm gonna tell Daddy.

685
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,187
He'll stop you!

686
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,531
For your own good, Dan.
He'll stop you!

687
00:44:47,453 --> 00:44:51,067
No, he'll never accept
an animal subject.

688
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:54,281
He'll claim it's some sort of
artificial stimulus response.

689
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,837
There's only one kind
of proof that he'll accept.

690
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:59,750
That he'll have to accept.

691
00:44:59,799 --> 00:45:01,776
No. No, Herbert,
we can't do that.

692
00:45:01,807 --> 00:45:04,419
Oh, yes...
We can.

693
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:21,012
- Oh, they keep on a-comin', don't they?
- Oh, yeah.

694
00:45:30,382 --> 00:45:33,219
You ain't got my lunch
under there, have you?

695
00:45:33,302 --> 00:45:35,554
Yeah, one meatball
run over by a semi.

696
00:45:35,638 --> 00:45:37,014
Ew!

697
00:45:37,097 --> 00:45:39,277
I lost my appetite. You gonna
be around for a while?

698
00:45:39,313 --> 00:45:41,815
- Yeah.
- I might go fetch me some coffee.

699
00:45:42,023 --> 00:45:43,604
- Take your time.
- You got it.

700
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:54,427
Meatball?

701
00:45:54,492 --> 00:45:56,176
Just put your shoes on.

702
00:46:09,229 --> 00:46:10,647
Oh, damn, if we get caught...

703
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:12,649
Oh, well, what will they do?

704
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:14,484
Embalm us?

705
00:46:15,137 --> 00:46:16,822
Let's go.

706
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,005
Okay.

707
00:46:35,255 --> 00:46:36,972
"Burn victim."

708
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,473
- Here's your meatball.
- Oh.

709
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:51,355
"Shotgun wound to the head."

710
00:46:53,523 --> 00:46:55,525
Oh, God, he's rotten.

711
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,567
- "Malpractice."
- Shit.

712
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:03,367
Let's go, we're not
gonna find anything.

713
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:05,160
Wait. Wait!

714
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:12,834
Yes, I think you.

715
00:47:13,389 --> 00:47:14,669
How long?

716
00:47:14,948 --> 00:47:17,284
He arrived early this evening.

717
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,508
John Doe, apparently just dropped dead.

718
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,605
No record of any damage.
It's almost perfect.

719
00:47:23,856 --> 00:47:26,482
- Why almost?
- Could be heart damage.

720
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,517
- Then just find another one!
- No! We do not have time!

721
00:47:30,766 --> 00:47:32,601
All we need tonight

722
00:47:32,685 --> 00:47:35,104
is a specific, conscious reaction.

723
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:36,772
He's been dead for hours.

724
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:40,150
Any evidence of re-animated
consciousness will justify proceeding.

725
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,538
Start the recorder.

726
00:47:45,864 --> 00:47:47,571
Start the damn recorder!

727
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,753
Make the entry.

728
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:56,374
October...

729
00:47:56,959 --> 00:47:58,777
- Tenth.
- Tenth.

730
00:47:59,086 --> 00:48:01,547
- Subject: Male.
- Age?

731
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:04,469
Age, early twenties.

732
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:08,303
- Physical condition?
- No deformities.

733
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:12,764
Appears to have been in
excellent physical condition.

734
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,730
Apparent cause of death...

735
00:48:20,441 --> 00:48:22,169
um... what?

736
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,570
Heart failure.

737
00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:27,204
Heart failure.

738
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:32,243
Time is 10:33 PM.

739
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:35,456
10:33 PM.

740
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,085
15 cc's.

741
00:48:42,129 --> 00:48:44,590
15 cc's of reagent being administered.

742
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,892
He loves me,
we're getting married.

743
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,853
He's mad! I've seen this happen
to medical students before.

744
00:48:57,936 --> 00:48:59,233
Good ones!

745
00:48:59,297 --> 00:49:02,492
Dr. Harrod, is Mr. Cain loose
in this hospital?

746
00:49:02,704 --> 00:49:04,610
In the morgue, I think, doctor.

747
00:49:04,657 --> 00:49:07,540
I specifically told
Dr. Riley to suspend him,

748
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:10,699
and to take him off the floor
if he reported to work!

749
00:49:10,783 --> 00:49:14,203
Dr. Riley's been
in emergency surgery for four hours.

750
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:16,081
I haven't seen him.

751
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:18,957
Time elapsed.

752
00:49:22,701 --> 00:49:24,293
15 seconds.

753
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:28,883
Something should
have happened by now.

754
00:49:40,813 --> 00:49:42,575
It's not working.

755
00:49:43,982 --> 00:49:44,983
Let's get out of here!

756
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:48,237
Obviously, the human dosage
factor is unknown.

757
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,948
Increasing the dosage,
20 cc's of reagent.

758
00:49:51,031 --> 00:49:52,956
- Herbert, let's go!
- No!

759
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:59,494
Ohhh...

760
00:50:18,736 --> 00:50:19,954
Damn!

761
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:23,105
Page Mr. Cain and have him report
to Level L security desk,

762
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:25,921
and make sure
that she stays right here.

763
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,861
You can't stop me! I followed you here,
and I'm gonna follow you

764
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:30,058
- until you listen to me!
- Megan!

765
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,213
- I love him!
- You're my daughter,

766
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:33,031
and you'll do as you're told!

767
00:50:33,115 --> 00:50:34,869
Sit down, Miss Halsey.

768
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:37,578
Mr. Cain will be up soon,
you can discuss it then.

769
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,329
Don't blame him, Daddy!

770
00:50:39,984 --> 00:50:41,627
We failed.

771
00:50:42,476 --> 00:50:43,722
Come on, let's go!

772
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,397
I mean, someone
could be coming any minute!

773
00:50:45,445 --> 00:50:48,065
He failed! Not I!

774
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:51,258
<i>Mr. Cain, Mr. Daniel Cain,

775
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:54,428
<i>please report
to the security desk, Level L

776
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:56,722
Oh, God.

777
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:58,116
Cover him up.

778
00:50:58,351 --> 00:50:59,353
Let's go.

779
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,008
- Let's go!
- Alright!

780
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:08,303
Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh!

781
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,095
Grab him!

782
00:51:26,796 --> 00:51:27,884
Stop!

783
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:33,675
It listened to me.

784
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,734
Cain?

785
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:47,483
Cain?

786
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:52,319
Cain, open up this door!

787
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,544
Help!

788
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:57,784
Get help!

789
00:51:57,921 --> 00:51:59,836
Is West in there with you?

790
00:51:59,904 --> 00:52:01,828
You're in a lot of trouble,
both of you!

791
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,478
No!

792
00:52:34,033 --> 00:52:35,407
Let go!

793
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,288
Stop!

794
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:52,118
For God's sakes!

795
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:53,220
Stop!

796
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:54,594
Dan...

797
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,493
look out.

798
00:53:13,629 --> 00:53:14,605
Oh...

799
00:53:26,288 --> 00:53:27,389
Come on.

800
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,751
Find the recorder!

801
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,839
- Herbert... no!
- Did you see him react?

802
00:53:35,922 --> 00:53:38,508
He listened to me.
It made a conscious act.

803
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:41,230
He heard you as an animal would.

804
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:44,598
Herbert, no, you can't be serious!

805
00:53:44,681 --> 00:53:46,141
Eh, you may be right.

806
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:48,982
It'd probably been dead too long.
It wasn't fresh enough!

807
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:53,065
We probably only revived the senses
and the instincts, so, come on!

808
00:53:53,106 --> 00:53:54,717
Help me get him up.

809
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:56,401
Is he dead?

810
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:58,820
Of course, will you
give me a hand here?

811
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:01,364
Now, he interrupted an important
experiment in progress.

812
00:54:01,448 --> 00:54:02,783
Granted, it was an accident.

813
00:54:02,866 --> 00:54:05,243
But this is the freshest body
that we could come across

814
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:06,495
save of killing one ourselves,

815
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:08,914
and every moment that we spend
talking about it costs us results!

816
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:10,999
Now will you give me a hand?

817
00:54:12,959 --> 00:54:14,230
Dan...

818
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:16,986
we can bring him back to life.

819
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:24,276
Yes.

820
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:31,535
Okay.

821
00:54:39,736 --> 00:54:41,989
Now, get the recorder.

822
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,825
Find my serum.

823
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,034
This is a dream.

824
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:51,835
Fiction.

825
00:54:53,364 --> 00:54:55,196
Here. Do his other hand.

826
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,053
Oh, good.

827
00:55:00,132 --> 00:55:02,447
Unbreakable plastic.

828
00:55:02,718 --> 00:55:06,134
It's one of man's few
durable inventions.

829
00:55:07,836 --> 00:55:10,112
Certainly more durable than this.

830
00:55:11,102 --> 00:55:13,073
We need you in the crash room.

831
00:55:14,727 --> 00:55:15,863
Coming.

832
00:55:45,678 --> 00:55:47,721
12 cc's being administered.

833
00:55:47,805 --> 00:55:52,021
The dosage lessened in accordance
to the freshness of the subject.

834
00:56:06,407 --> 00:56:07,821
5 seconds.

835
00:56:08,204 --> 00:56:09,479
5 seconds.

836
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,004
Come on.

837
00:56:13,993 --> 00:56:15,469
I'll show you.

838
00:56:18,085 --> 00:56:20,922
15 seconds. I'll show you!

839
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:23,592
17 seconds.

840
00:56:23,632 --> 00:56:26,100
Re-animation at 17 seconds!
The eyes opened!

841
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:27,888
Doctor. Dr. Halsey,

842
00:56:28,275 --> 00:56:31,682
you once did me a favor by
letting me into your medical school.

843
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:33,056
Doctor...

844
00:56:33,434 --> 00:56:35,186
welcome back to life.

845
00:56:58,272 --> 00:56:59,578
Daddy?

846
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:01,550
Dan?

847
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:03,376
Damn that bitch.

848
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:04,885
Megan...

849
00:57:05,479 --> 00:57:06,646
Meg?

850
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,560
Dan.

851
00:57:11,987 --> 00:57:13,971
What is it,
are you alright?

852
00:57:18,493 --> 00:57:20,852
Dan, he's trying to speak,
the recorder!

853
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:24,821
Rrrrraaaaahhhh!

854
00:57:25,026 --> 00:57:26,363
No!

855
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:28,110
Daddy!

856
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:30,602
- Daddy, no!
- No! No, Meg, don't go near him!

857
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:32,325
- No!
- What the hell happened here?

858
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:33,872
Dan, you alright?

859
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:35,545
Who's that?

860
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:41,464
Uh...
that is Dean Halsey, sir.

861
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:45,130
You see I came down here
to visit Mr. Cain,

862
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,025
who was here working
and Halsey entered

863
00:57:48,088 --> 00:57:50,861
and started ranting at us,
rather irrationally.

864
00:57:50,898 --> 00:57:52,316
No!

865
00:57:52,447 --> 00:57:54,678
He was just angry!

866
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:56,066
- Daddy!
- Meg.

867
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,110
What happened?

868
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:58,334
Who's that over there?

869
00:57:58,381 --> 00:58:00,311
Uh, just, a-- just a corpse.

870
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:03,815
You see, Halsey came in,
grabbed that thing,

871
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:06,903
and, well, went crazy.

872
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,194
Dean Halsey?
Dean Halsey!

873
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,490
Arrest them!

874
00:58:10,588 --> 00:58:12,116
I'm calling the police!

875
00:58:12,214 --> 00:58:14,254
Oh, Daddy!

876
00:58:26,109 --> 00:58:27,436
Shock.

877
00:58:28,311 --> 00:58:29,467
Don't worry.

878
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,298
Eat that.
We have work to do.

879
00:58:43,205 --> 00:58:44,238
First of all,

880
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:46,196
there are a few decisions
that we have to make.

881
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:48,347
Now fortunately, the police accepted

882
00:58:48,402 --> 00:58:50,200
the explanation, that Halsey went mad.

883
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:52,126
Well,
what else could they believe?

884
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,120
The truth?
That he died and came back?

885
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,566
We did it, Dan!

886
00:58:56,597 --> 00:58:58,238
Did you see him react,
to his daughter?

887
00:58:58,261 --> 00:59:00,365
He recognized her.
He knew who she was.

888
00:59:00,402 --> 00:59:01,957
And he knew,
what had happened to him.

889
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:03,747
He had conscious thought!

890
00:59:04,823 --> 00:59:06,055
Oh.

891
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:08,880
So...

892
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,916
So, we can stay here
in school, if we want.

893
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:14,461
It is up to us, Dan,
what our next move--

894
00:59:14,495 --> 00:59:15,690
is going--

895
00:59:16,096 --> 00:59:17,232
umph...

896
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,224
when we show the world--

897
00:59:19,268 --> 00:59:20,811
gahhh--

898
01:00:02,992 --> 01:00:04,394
Uh, Dan!

899
01:00:06,234 --> 01:00:07,351
The hypo.

900
01:00:08,133 --> 01:00:09,984
- God, Herbert, you're actually--
- No!

901
01:00:10,031 --> 01:00:11,830
No, it's just a weak solution.

902
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,204
So I don't have to sleep,
just to keep the brain...

903
01:00:14,588 --> 01:00:15,698
sharp.

904
01:00:16,244 --> 01:00:17,570
- No!
- Yes!

905
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,923
I need it!

906
01:00:19,018 --> 01:00:20,323
Please?

907
01:00:26,057 --> 01:00:28,047
- How much?
- 5 cc's.

908
01:00:49,284 --> 01:00:51,074
Oh!
Give it to me.

909
01:00:51,268 --> 01:00:52,404
Please!

910
01:01:08,865 --> 01:01:10,056
Now...

911
01:01:11,958 --> 01:01:13,921
we must make our plans.

912
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,695
Daddy.

913
01:01:36,705 --> 01:01:39,165
He can't hear you, or see you.

914
01:01:39,249 --> 01:01:41,015
That's a one-way mirror.

915
01:01:43,962 --> 01:01:46,496
What is wrong with him, doctor?

916
01:01:48,194 --> 01:01:49,407
Will he ever be--

917
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:51,886
Until we know exactly what
happened to him,

918
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:55,343
there's no way to determine
his course of recovery.

919
01:01:57,767 --> 01:02:00,520
That's why I need you
to sign a release,

920
01:02:00,603 --> 01:02:03,565
so that I can perform
exploratory surgery on him.

921
01:02:04,774 --> 01:02:07,644
Is that absolutely necessary,
Dr. Hill?

922
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:11,141
I know how difficult
this must be for you.

923
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:17,261
But I'm convinced that your father's
problem is neurological.

924
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:20,417
Of course, we'll take
every precaution.

925
01:02:24,544 --> 01:02:26,660
You must trust me.

926
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,979
I want to take a look at the
right frontal lobe.

927
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:44,671
I'll open the skull here--

928
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:46,694
I...
don't want to know.

929
01:02:48,026 --> 01:02:49,894
Just help him.

930
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:14,010
Please, doctor.

931
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:17,532
Please let me talk to him.

932
01:03:18,139 --> 01:03:19,318
No.

933
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:24,040
I must insist you leave his
treatment up to me.

934
01:03:27,476 --> 01:03:29,753
And I insist...

935
01:03:29,894 --> 01:03:32,207
you call me Carl.

936
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:42,787
I want you to think of me as someone
you can come to with your problems.

937
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:48,366
Or if you're ever lonely.

938
01:03:53,023 --> 01:03:56,167
I know you're all by yourself now.

939
01:04:05,846 --> 01:04:08,224
I'm going to take care
of him, doctor,

940
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:11,335
and I'm going to find out
what happened to him.

941
01:04:41,241 --> 01:04:44,270
First and second
lumbar vertebrae are crushed.

942
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:48,344
And dorsal ganglion is torn.

943
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:53,898
Inferior cervical ganglion is torn.

944
01:04:55,707 --> 01:04:58,545
The neck,
is broken!

945
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:08,742
Dean Halsey,
is clearly dead.

946
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:20,347
Patients' brain wave is erratic.

947
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:22,477
Disconnected.

948
01:05:22,529 --> 01:05:23,638
Ha...

949
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:27,807
I've never seen anything like it.

950
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:37,242
The patient,
though apparently dead...

951
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:41,954
must be made docile...

952
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:45,448
so that he can be studied, more closely.

953
01:06:02,018 --> 01:06:03,880
What are you doing here?

954
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:06,508
I've been waiting for you.

955
01:06:07,065 --> 01:06:09,030
I have to tell you.

956
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:13,101
What did you do to him?

957
01:06:15,657 --> 01:06:18,638
What did you and West do
to him to make him like that?

958
01:06:20,286 --> 01:06:22,827
It was... it was horrible.

959
01:06:24,707 --> 01:06:26,238
I didn't...

960
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:30,578
What did you do to him?

961
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:39,190
He's not insane.

962
01:06:43,851 --> 01:06:45,109
He's dead.

963
01:06:46,938 --> 01:06:48,265
No.

964
01:06:49,688 --> 01:06:51,123
No!

965
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:54,821
You're insane,
you are insane, no!

966
01:06:54,904 --> 01:06:56,705
You know it's true, Meg.

967
01:06:57,182 --> 01:06:58,491
You know it's true.

968
01:06:58,574 --> 01:06:59,906
No!

969
01:07:05,123 --> 01:07:06,489
Daddy.

970
01:07:07,896 --> 01:07:09,546
 Daddy.

971
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:17,719
I'll tell you, Meg.
Everything.

972
01:07:30,202 --> 01:07:31,733
Good evening, Mr. West.

973
01:07:37,238 --> 01:07:38,859
What do you want?

974
01:07:39,574 --> 01:07:42,577
I want to know why Halsey's
heart fibrillated.

975
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,995
I don't have to talk to you.

976
01:07:44,078 --> 01:07:45,747
Why his pulse is erratic.

977
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,816
I've told everything I know
to the police.

978
01:07:47,879 --> 01:07:50,144
Why he cries out in pain.

979
01:07:50,183 --> 01:07:51,753
You can leave now, doctor.

980
01:07:51,794 --> 01:07:56,329
When we both know
he is quite dead.

981
01:08:01,014 --> 01:08:02,252
Hmm...

982
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:06,295
Interesting little laboratory
you have here.

983
01:08:06,809 --> 01:08:09,600
Ah! Mr. West!

984
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:12,511
I recognize this.
Hmm.

985
01:08:14,669 --> 01:08:16,319
What do you want?

986
01:08:16,402 --> 01:08:20,020
Yes, we are both scientists.

987
01:08:20,615 --> 01:08:23,057
Let us get to the point.

988
01:08:27,038 --> 01:08:29,168
I want your discovery.

989
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:34,601
Whatever it is that gives the
dead the appearance of life.

990
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:36,494
Oh, it is not the appearance of life.

991
01:08:36,494 --> 01:08:38,125
It is life. This is not magic.

992
01:08:38,157 --> 01:08:41,302
As you say,
I am a scientist.

993
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:44,307
I'll have you locked up
for a madman...

994
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,198
or a murderer.

995
01:08:51,017 --> 01:08:52,849
You will do...

996
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:55,447
what I tell you to do.

997
01:08:56,814 --> 01:08:58,884
Yes, doctor.

998
01:08:59,517 --> 01:09:02,524
I want to see your notes.

999
01:09:29,092 --> 01:09:31,630
Ingenious, Mr. West.

1000
01:09:32,471 --> 01:09:37,055
Your extension of that old fool
Gruber's work is really quite...

1001
01:09:37,809 --> 01:09:39,026
brilliant.

1002
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:44,568
You...

1003
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,977
will be my assistant.

1004
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:49,252
We will work...

1005
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:51,854
very closely together.

1006
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:58,160
And in a year or so...

1007
01:09:59,514 --> 01:10:03,051
I will reveal,
to an astonished world...

1008
01:10:03,202 --> 01:10:06,130
my new serum.

1009
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:09,918
They will retire
the Nobel Prize in my name.

1010
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:12,382
And you,
as my assistant...

1011
01:10:12,534 --> 01:10:14,015
will be famous.

1012
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:19,042
That leaves only Cain.

1013
01:10:20,745 --> 01:10:23,529
He, will disappear.

1014
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,737
Ohhhh...

1015
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,529
- Yes.
- Yes.

1016
01:10:33,556 --> 01:10:36,899
I think, West believes,
we'll really get away with it.

1017
01:10:37,213 --> 01:10:38,568
Oh, ha...

1018
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,839
and I didn't think that at all.

1019
01:10:40,974 --> 01:10:42,077
Huh...

1020
01:10:42,169 --> 01:10:46,080
I think, he's only excited,
by the experiment.

1021
01:10:49,305 --> 01:10:51,140
We tried to save him.

1022
01:10:52,883 --> 01:10:54,799
West, killed the...

1023
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,842
the thing.

1024
01:10:59,693 --> 01:11:01,306
The corpse.

1025
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,024
West, killed the corpse.

1026
01:11:05,222 --> 01:11:06,938
I see how that sounds.

1027
01:11:07,102 --> 01:11:09,642
I'll go to the police,
but I gotta have proof.

1028
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,896
I'll turn myself in,
but I gotta see your father first.

1029
01:11:15,642 --> 01:11:17,165
He's dead.

1030
01:11:21,931 --> 01:11:23,620
I have to prove it.

1031
01:11:43,843 --> 01:11:45,636
Has Dr. Hill examined
your father?

1032
01:11:45,719 --> 01:11:47,012
Yes.

1033
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:50,099
He wanted to do exploratory
surgery on him.

1034
01:11:50,537 --> 01:11:52,664
Oh, shit.

1035
01:11:53,143 --> 01:11:54,902
Then he'll find out.

1036
01:11:56,222 --> 01:11:58,481
Eventually he'll find out.

1037
01:11:59,947 --> 01:12:02,490
Let us see...

1038
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:05,899
my new serum at work.
Hmm?

1039
01:12:08,852 --> 01:12:10,303
Dead cat tissue.

1040
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:11,582
Oh.

1041
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:17,458
The reagent.

1042
01:12:44,232 --> 01:12:46,443
Magnificent.

1043
01:13:02,715 --> 01:13:05,634
Yes, Mr. West.

1044
01:13:06,634 --> 01:13:10,447
I will be famous.

1045
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,741
Plagiarist!

1046
01:14:10,406 --> 01:14:11,870
Yes.

1047
01:14:16,912 --> 01:14:18,437
Parts.

1048
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:23,014
I've never done whole...

1049
01:14:24,637 --> 01:14:26,044
parts.

1050
01:15:14,553 --> 01:15:19,308
Wesssssst!

1051
01:15:22,478 --> 01:15:24,563
Yes, doctor.

1052
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:26,778
It's Herbert West.

1053
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:28,484
What are you thinking?

1054
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,272
How do you feel?

1055
01:15:31,581 --> 01:15:35,410
Yooooooou.

1056
01:15:36,315 --> 01:15:37,323
" You."

1057
01:15:37,846 --> 01:15:41,119
Baaaaaa

1058
01:15:41,151 --> 01:15:46,151
staaarrrd!

1059
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:20,929
Dan!

1060
01:17:21,157 --> 01:17:24,179
Oh my God, what has Hill
done to him?

1061
01:17:29,438 --> 01:17:31,494
Looks like a laser drill.

1062
01:17:33,817 --> 01:17:35,497
Your father's been lobotomized.

1063
01:18:20,989 --> 01:18:22,498
That's it.

1064
01:18:24,326 --> 01:18:27,496
My work! My work!

1065
01:18:27,579 --> 01:18:28,538
What's going on?

1066
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:31,375
My work! It's gone!

1067
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,055
It's all gone!

1068
01:18:33,134 --> 01:18:34,635
He took my serum!

1069
01:18:34,685 --> 01:18:36,421
Except for what
I have upstairs.

1070
01:18:36,505 --> 01:18:37,697
Who?

1071
01:18:37,864 --> 01:18:39,341
What happened here?

1072
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:40,467
Hill.

1073
01:18:40,884 --> 01:18:43,845
Hill took my serum!
My notes! Everything.

1074
01:18:43,874 --> 01:18:45,757
Herbert, you're insane!
Now, what happened here?

1075
01:18:45,803 --> 01:18:46,960
I had to kill him!

1076
01:18:47,266 --> 01:18:48,512
What?

1077
01:18:49,525 --> 01:18:50,632
He's dead?

1078
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:54,425
Not any more.

1079
01:18:55,979 --> 01:18:58,819
No, Herbert!
This has gotta stop!

1080
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,445
Look, he tried
to blackmail me, Dan.

1081
01:19:00,487 --> 01:19:02,863
- Enough is enough!
- And he wanted you to disappear!

1082
01:19:13,174 --> 01:19:14,555
Oh.

1083
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:16,695
Oh.

1084
01:19:17,127 --> 01:19:19,006
Oh, that's why he did
it to Halsey.

1085
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:20,340
What? You've seen Halsey?

1086
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:23,416
He lobotomized him, so he could
control him in case

1087
01:19:23,455 --> 01:19:25,929
he ever tried to talk or tell
somebody what happened.

1088
01:19:26,013 --> 01:19:28,307
So he could protect <i>his</i> discovery.

1089
01:19:28,348 --> 01:19:30,058
- Yes.
- Very clever.

1090
01:19:30,142 --> 01:19:31,356
I gotta tell Meg.

1091
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,331
What does Meg
have to do with this?

1092
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:35,063
Hill's got this weird file on her,

1093
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:37,649
it's full of napkins and hair
and photographs.

1094
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:40,394
I think he's projected some sort
of psychotic need onto her.

1095
01:19:46,536 --> 01:19:48,848
You're sick.
You're as sick as he is!

1096
01:19:48,887 --> 01:19:50,714
Oh, I don't think so.

1097
01:19:50,887 --> 01:19:53,298
- So, what do we do now?!
- Well...

1098
01:19:54,051 --> 01:19:56,182
we're the only ones
that know the truth.

1099
01:19:56,239 --> 01:19:57,571
Yes?

1100
01:19:57,622 --> 01:19:58,878
So...

1101
01:19:58,911 --> 01:20:01,055
he'll have to come to us.

1102
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:04,015
You mean, after us.

1103
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:39,364
Yes.

1104
01:21:56,488 --> 01:21:58,199
Are you sure he's coming?

1105
01:21:58,286 --> 01:21:59,767
Yes.

1106
01:22:00,044 --> 01:22:03,325
Because if what you told me is true, he
can hardly just, walk down the street.

1107
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:06,589
Perhaps not him, but somebody.
Some, thing, will.

1108
01:22:06,912 --> 01:22:08,372
And we're just gonna sit here.

1109
01:22:08,420 --> 01:22:10,392
I told you,
I have a plan.

1110
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,137
I bet you do.

1111
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:14,600
So do I.

1112
01:22:14,635 --> 01:22:16,801
Oh, now, Dan,
he spoke words.

1113
01:22:17,051 --> 01:22:19,191
The speech patterns,
the muscle control.

1114
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,225
You just wait 'til you seen him.
You wait.

1115
01:22:23,245 --> 01:22:26,029
Alan.

1116
01:22:36,896 --> 01:22:39,031
I still don't understand
why he'd come here.

1117
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,232
Because, he wants the credit.

1118
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:42,875
Both of him.

1119
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,628
No, don't you understand?

1120
01:22:44,675 --> 01:22:49,024
We stand between him
and his obsessive desire.

1121
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,038
Obsessive desire.

1122
01:22:52,347 --> 01:22:54,096
Besides, he hates me.
Well...

1123
01:22:54,722 --> 01:22:56,106
he's jealous.

1124
01:22:57,464 --> 01:22:58,696
Meg!

1125
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,272
Oh, my God.

1126
01:23:00,415 --> 01:23:02,340
Don't you see?
It's not us he wants.

1127
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:03,482
It's her!

1128
01:23:03,852 --> 01:23:05,406
I gotta go now!

1129
01:23:37,656 --> 01:23:39,197
Is that you, Dr. Hill?

1130
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:41,060
Of course it's me.

1131
01:23:53,547 --> 01:23:55,169
Break time.

1132
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:27,499
That's... better.

1133
01:25:14,498 --> 01:25:18,169
Meg? Meg!

1134
01:25:18,252 --> 01:25:21,447
Dan? Dan...

1135
01:25:21,558 --> 01:25:23,801
- I was so afraid.
- What is it?

1136
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:26,802
What's the matter?

1137
01:25:27,252 --> 01:25:28,594
Well...

1138
01:25:29,854 --> 01:25:31,139
I don't know, I...

1139
01:25:31,506 --> 01:25:33,612
I was just worried about you.

1140
01:25:35,052 --> 01:25:36,278
Why?

1141
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:38,503
I...

1142
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:42,527
I just feel horrible
about everything.

1143
01:25:45,145 --> 01:25:47,393
I guess I'm just getting paranoid.

1144
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:52,439
It's just...

1145
01:25:53,487 --> 01:25:55,370
so hard to lose you.

1146
01:25:57,608 --> 01:25:59,623
You should go away.

1147
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:05,415
Transfer to another school.

1148
01:26:05,826 --> 01:26:07,619
Don't worry about me.

1149
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:12,423
You're the one
that should get away.

1150
01:26:15,179 --> 01:26:16,579
Go live your life.

1151
01:26:20,514 --> 01:26:22,230
Find somebody.

1152
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,399
I tried to hate you.

1153
01:26:28,592 --> 01:26:32,020
I wanted so much to hate you.

1154
01:26:36,694 --> 01:26:38,458
I love you.

1155
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:42,991
No! Daddy!

1156
01:26:43,075 --> 01:26:44,539
Dr. Halsey.

1157
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:49,292
No, Daddy!

1158
01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:55,507
Oh, no, Daddy!

1159
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:58,561
Don't!

1160
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:14,164
The door.

1161
01:27:54,616 --> 01:27:55,873
Oh...

1162
01:27:55,912 --> 01:27:57,803
yes...

1163
01:27:57,842 --> 01:28:00,913
Alan...

1164
01:28:33,585 --> 01:28:36,022
Ahhhhh!

1165
01:28:44,522 --> 01:28:45,871
Dan?

1166
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:48,029
Dan?

1167
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:50,421
Dan?!

1168
01:28:51,498 --> 01:28:52,889
Come on.

1169
01:28:53,417 --> 01:28:54,810
Ahhhhh!

1170
01:28:56,711 --> 01:28:58,797
Oh, well, you'll be alright.

1171
01:28:59,153 --> 01:29:00,309
Meg!

1172
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:02,550
Oh, my God.

1173
01:29:02,634 --> 01:29:04,005
Where, Herbert?

1174
01:29:04,048 --> 01:29:06,819
He's at the hospital I imagine.
Can you stand up?

1175
01:29:06,872 --> 01:29:08,124
Let's go.

1176
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,685
Oh...

1177
01:29:17,718 --> 01:29:21,675
Meg.

1178
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:01,026
I've always...

1179
01:30:01,847 --> 01:30:06,027
admired your beauty, my dear.

1180
01:30:07,996 --> 01:30:12,697
I think I've always loved you.

1181
01:30:20,866 --> 01:30:24,061
You will love me.

1182
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:32,367
You will!

1183
01:30:34,809 --> 01:30:36,561
Please!

1184
01:30:36,644 --> 01:30:38,219
Please stop!

1185
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:40,357
Let me go!

1186
01:30:40,398 --> 01:30:43,860
That's it, my dearest Meg...

1187
01:30:43,943 --> 01:30:46,613
more passion!

1188
01:30:49,741 --> 01:30:54,371
- Oh, my God!
- Yes, my love!

1189
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,324
I must say, Dr. Hill...

1190
01:30:57,379 --> 01:31:00,829
I'm very disappointed in you.

1191
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:03,713
You steal the secret
of life and death,

1192
01:31:03,797 --> 01:31:07,050
and here you are trysting
with the bubble-headed coed.

1193
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:09,928
You're not even
a second-rate scientist.

1194
01:31:10,183 --> 01:31:13,264
Ah! Mr. West!

1195
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,770
I'm actually glad to see you.

1196
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:22,990
It saves me the trouble
of having to send for you.

1197
01:31:23,108 --> 01:31:25,402
You'll never get credit
for my discovery.

1198
01:31:25,485 --> 01:31:27,112
Who's gonna believe
a talking head?

1199
01:31:27,195 --> 01:31:28,988
Get a job in a sideshow.

1200
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:31,408
I wonder why

1201
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:35,870
an intelligent young man like yourself

1202
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:42,335
should make such a foolish,
fatal mistake,

1203
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:46,965
of coming here to challenge me.

1204
01:31:47,298 --> 01:31:50,468
Oh... I have a plan.

1205
01:31:50,696 --> 01:31:54,881
So do I.

1206
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,461
Let go of me!

1207
01:32:33,897 --> 01:32:35,045
Enough!

1208
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:52,745
I will show you power, Mr. West!

1209
01:32:52,842 --> 01:32:54,944
My discovery,

1210
01:32:55,155 --> 01:32:57,881
a laser surgical drill.

1211
01:32:57,912 --> 01:33:02,091
It makes possible a new
technique in lobotomy,

1212
01:33:03,218 --> 01:33:07,210
which results in total mastery

1213
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,433
of the human will.

1214
01:33:09,516 --> 01:33:12,519
Re-animated subjects

1215
01:33:12,603 --> 01:33:15,731
have proven to be the best.

1216
01:33:15,814 --> 01:33:19,610
They will give me power!

1217
01:33:19,693 --> 01:33:22,946
Undreamed of power.

1218
01:33:25,449 --> 01:33:26,871
Stay behind me.

1219
01:33:31,872 --> 01:33:33,040
Daddy, listen to me.

1220
01:33:33,123 --> 01:33:35,375
It's Megan, Megan!

1221
01:33:35,459 --> 01:33:37,044
Hill, they'll kill her!

1222
01:33:37,201 --> 01:33:39,274
Then I'll give her life!

1223
01:33:41,381 --> 01:33:43,759
Look at me!

1224
01:33:56,367 --> 01:33:58,488
Ah!
Ahhh!

1225
01:33:59,132 --> 01:34:00,389
Ahhhhh!

1226
01:34:06,612 --> 01:34:07,662
Ahhhh!

1227
01:34:18,813 --> 01:34:19,923
What the...

1228
01:34:35,531 --> 01:34:37,110
Aaaaahhhhh!

1229
01:34:46,653 --> 01:34:48,434
Herbert, come on!
Let's go.

1230
01:34:48,496 --> 01:34:49,609
Come on!

1231
01:34:49,645 --> 01:34:50,675
No, wait!

1232
01:34:50,707 --> 01:34:52,253
I am not through here!

1233
01:34:52,703 --> 01:34:54,624
Megan, no! No!

1234
01:34:54,672 --> 01:34:57,839
- No! Let me go!
- I told you, I have a theory!

1235
01:34:58,508 --> 01:35:00,990
- Overdose!
- No!

1236
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:55,130
Herbert!

1237
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:16,167
Look out!

1238
01:36:24,785 --> 01:36:26,200
Daddy!

1239
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:27,365
Go, Meg!

1240
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:38,213
My notes!

1241
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:41,018
My notes!

1242
01:36:45,609 --> 01:36:46,888
Let's go.

1243
01:36:58,296 --> 01:36:59,560
Oh, no!

1244
01:37:05,295 --> 01:37:06,493
Stop it!

1245
01:37:15,573 --> 01:37:16,713
Come on!

1246
01:37:58,028 --> 01:37:59,174
Meg!

1247
01:38:27,707 --> 01:38:28,824
My God! Megan!

1248
01:38:28,845 --> 01:38:30,247
Dan, take her into number three!

1249
01:38:30,287 --> 01:38:31,576
Bring her this way!

1250
01:38:33,923 --> 01:38:35,412
Is she breathing?

1251
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,760
Okay, hurry, hurry,
she's got nothing!

1252
01:38:39,844 --> 01:38:41,519
Activating.

1253
01:38:42,513 --> 01:38:43,720
Air on.

1254
01:38:50,688 --> 01:38:52,398
Somebody give me some paste!

1255
01:38:52,481 --> 01:38:53,791
On three!

1256
01:38:56,193 --> 01:38:57,495
Okay, everybody off!

1257
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:58,625
Clear.

1258
01:38:59,107 --> 01:39:00,202
Clear.

1259
01:39:03,995 --> 01:39:05,202
Nothing.

1260
01:39:06,203 --> 01:39:07,788
Bringing back air.

1261
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:12,627
The trachea's fractured.

1262
01:39:12,668 --> 01:39:14,003
She's fixed and dilated.

1263
01:39:14,086 --> 01:39:15,622
No response.

1264
01:39:21,010 --> 01:39:22,256
Cain.

1265

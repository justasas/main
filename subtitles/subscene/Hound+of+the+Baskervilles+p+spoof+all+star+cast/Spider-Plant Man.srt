Grandioso

Are the CBB's. 
How many possibilities are there to escape 
morda and a novice photographer? 

6 
00:00:59,976 -> 00:01:05,876 
None. Safety is our priority, we

00:01:06,277 -> 00:01:08,277 
the best ever has to know now

But you ..

if you want to get out alive 

16 
00:02:24,683 -> 00:02:27,983 
This means that something 
really bad is about to happen. 

17 
00:03:24,584 -> 00:03:26,084 
Sorry. 

18 
00:03:36,285 -> 00:03:39,085 
Oh my God is Mary Jane.

No, not right. 

23 
00:04:11,090 -> 00:04:14,090 
Perfect. Much better 

24 
00:04:30,691 -> 00:04:32,091 
Incredible. 

25 
00:04:32,892 -> 00:04:33,492 
What are you? 

26 
00:04:34,493 -> 00:04:36,793 
I am your friendly neighborhood superhero

00:04:38,995 -> 00:04:41,995 
Paper could be Peter. That 
would like to know at school. 

29 
00:04:42,596 -> 00:04:45,896 
But of course not, that type is all weirdo, 

30 
00:04:45,996 -> 00:04:48,296 
I would not even with him in 1 million years 

31 
00:04:49,006 -> 00:04:51,996 
Fortunately he is not 

32 
00:04:54,997 -> 00:04:57,997 
But unfortunately I can not reveal my true identity. 

33 
00:04:58,098 -> 00:04:59,998 
what a pity. 

34 
00:05:04,999 -> 00:05:08,499 
Call me. Sometimes I would see you without that costumino. 

35 
00:05:09,300 -> 00:05:10,300

You know what I drive now? The bat-mobile?

67 
00:08:01,328 -> 00:08:07,728 
Well, excuse me, Batman, I'd like to help you solve your problems 
but I'm afraid to have more important things to do 

68 
00:08:07,929 -> 00:08:11,029 
More important than saving the life of Mary Jane 

69 
00:08:11,730 -> 00:08:12,830

70 
00:08:13,231 -> 00:08:15,231

Who is calling me "Spider-man Plant 
or the real man who is hiding inside? 

104 
00:13:16,859 -> 00:13:18,459

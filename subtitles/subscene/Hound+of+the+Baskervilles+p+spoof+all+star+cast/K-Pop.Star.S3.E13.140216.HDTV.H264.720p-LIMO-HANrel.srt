00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,186
Survival Audition KPOP Star S3

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,990
The battle audition is like a fierce battle
in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,720
Our competitiveness is our group of
experts with 15 years of experience.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,000
I go to check on them
and give advice.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
I want them to go a
level higher.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,180
I made a few of them to take
on a bold challenge.

7
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,720
They'll proudly advance to
the TOP10 if they succeed.

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,900
If not, I hope it becomes an opportunity
for them to realize what they lack.

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,630
We're confident of our
group of musicians.

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:50,610
Korea's best guitarist, Ham Chun-ho,
is gladly helping them out.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,080
My long-time colleague, Kim Yeon-woo,
and ALi are giving them lessons.

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,550
I'm confident regarding that.

13
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,850
I venture to predict that
many from YG will make it.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,330
I feel like a mother eagle dropping
her eaglets off a cliff.

15
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,490
The battle audition is the death round
with each agency head's honor on the line.

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,950
It begins now!

17
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,810
The winner of KPOP STAR
Season 3 will be awarded...

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,870
A cash prize of $300,000

19
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,900
Make their first debut

20
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,030
And receive a powerful
mid-size diesel vehicle...

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,880
And a compact diesel vehicle.

22
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,890
[The battle audition goes on]

23
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,680
[Tension hangs in the air!]

24
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,110
[Who will take the
remaining 8 seats?]

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,870
Let's start the next battle.
Yao Weitao from JYP.

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,150
Sam Kim from Antenna Music.

27
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,960
The Shorties from YG.

28
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,080
[When opponents were
announced that day]

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,820
Before the battle audition,
I was afraid of the Shorties.

30
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,920
They're strong opponents.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,490
Sam Kim from Antenna Music.

32
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,940
I was surprised and
wanted to cry.

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,860
[These two are even more nervous
for facing the extreme Shorties!]

34
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,920
[Who will win this battle?]

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,380
Please enter the stage!

36
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,660
[They enter determined!]

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,710
[One chance for victory!]

38
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,280
[1st enters the TOP10!]

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,610
[2nd prepares for rematch!]

40
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,930
[3rd is eliminated on the spot!]

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,750
[Who will enter the TOP10?]

42
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,160
[The Shorties look beautiful
with the help of YG]

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,490
They're cute!

44
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:07,870
[Two have made it into
the TOP10 so far!]

45
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,950
[Who is the third?]

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,710
We have outstanding people
in this group as well.

47
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:23,640
Many mentioned the Shorties as an
opponent they don't want to face.

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Sam, how did you feel when you heard
you were in the same group as them?

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,650
I wanted to cry.

50
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,590
They're frightening.

51
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,730
It was Christmas-themed clothes before
and now it's post-impressionist.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,850
First is JYP's Yao Weitao.

53
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,040
The rest will wait on the side.

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:50,590
[Now the battle begins!]

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,100
[He looks a little thin]

56
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,130
We talked about many things during
practice and also gave much thought.

57
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,980
But today... as we already said,
forget about everything...

58
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,100
Just think about your
father as you sing.

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,460
[Does the song have anything
to do with his father?]

60
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,070
[The day his song was
examined by JYP]

61
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:20,500
["Dance with My Father"
was chosen for him]

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,120
Does he know what
the song is about?

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,580
He wants to be a child again
and dance with his father.

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,070
He has to convey that feeling...
Is his father still living?

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,810
No, he passed away
when I was young.

66
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,720
[He's in the same position as
the singer of this song!]

67
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,170
12 years old...

68
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,230
When you were 12.

69
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,920
[He was 12 years old when
his father passed away]

70
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,320
["Dance with My Father" was sung
in memory of his father]

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,690
My father got sick and
it was cancer.

72
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,680
He died 3 months later.

73
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,250
I grieved back then
when I was at home.

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,450
My mother had a hard time.

75
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,340
It was hard at the time, but now
it's okay after some years passed.

76
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,570
[Calling his mother in Shanghai]

77
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,220
I miss you.

78
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:30,510
I saw you on television
singing with this girl.

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,990
I liked your high notes and the
judges were complimenting you.

80
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,450
I love you, mom.

81
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,040
I love you too.

82
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,700
My mom is dearer than
the world to me.

83
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:58,160
I called her some time ago and
found out she was very sick.

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,700
I had to be there to help her but
couldn't so it broke my heart.

85
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,810
My goal for now is to
make it into the TOP10.

86
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,250
I don't care if I'm eliminated...

87
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,880
But I have this desire
to win at least this time.

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,790
I'll do my best today.

89
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,730
[This song is dedicated to his father
but will it touch everyone's heart?]

90
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,710
[Dance with My Father - Luther Vandross]

91
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,100
[It's really good]

92
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:26,870
Thank you.

93
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,430
[What did the judges think of
his heartfelt singing?]

94
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,340
[There's a heavy silence]

95
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,630
When I see Yao Weitao...

96
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,800
When I first saw him, he was
good-looking and a chef...

97
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,170
Compared to that, he didn't sing well.
His high notes weren't open.

98
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:07,220
In the past few months,
his singing improved.

99
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,180
One unfortunate thing...

100
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,280
His high notes are open, but
I hope it had more strength.

101
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,440
Maybe I'm asking for too much...

102
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:31,020
He made remarkable progress, but it would
move us more if he had strong high notes.

103
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,730
I enjoyed it.

104
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,960
[He didn't get a good commentary
regarding the high notes]

105
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,700
[And You Hee-yeol's commentary?]

106
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,570
JYP gave you a lot of training
and you made great strides.

107
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,070
But...

108
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,460
You're in the process.

109
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,670
Just a little more will
make you complete.

110
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:03,740
The chorus part of the song
is where people are moved.

111
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,530
But it's always unsatisfactory
compared to the first part.

112
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:12,930
That's a problem you
need to resolve.

113
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,350
[He gets their commentaries
through interpretation]

114
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,050
[The two judges' commentaries
left much to be desired]

115
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,500
[What is JYP's commentary since
he spent a lot of time with him?]

116
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,750
Changing one's vocalization
at the age of 26 is...

117
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,240
The same as learning a
foreign language at that age.

118
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,240
It's like a challenge in how fast
you can sound like a native speaker.

119
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,360
But as you are now,
you came very far.

120
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,280
I felt how you tried to
empathize. You did well.

121
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,040
[JYP finished his commentary with
warm words of encouragement]

122
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,810
[Will he get the honor of
advancing to the TOP10?]

123
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,200
The next contestant is
Antenna Music's Sam Kim.

124
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,120
[Antenna Music's Sam Kim (16)]

125
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,340
[With the Shorties going last]

126

[You Hee-yeol is concerned]

127
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,820
His guitar teacher was
Ham Chun-ho...

128
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,650
Really?

129
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,980
And his vocal teachers were
Kim Yeon-woo and ALi.

130
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,390
Wow. Being taught the guitar by
Chun-ho that itself is an honor.

131
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,610
We look forward to a
great performance.

132
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,220
[Will Sam show the fruits
of his training?]

133
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,940
How did you feel when you heard you're
battling Yao Weitao and the Shorties?

134
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,310
[He sighs and sighs]

135
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,820
[Why is Sam so tense?]

136
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:19,050
1/2 were slightly better.
Congratulations.

137
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,880
[Sam was a part of E.Q that lost
to the Shorties in Round 3]

138

Play on mine.

142
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:17,300
- I'm afraid.
- You are? Me too.

143
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,320

[As if he's proud of
16-year-old Sam's talents]

I'll lend you my guitar
if you get into the finals.

147
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,890
[He'll gladly lend his
guitar that is his life]

148
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,280
- I don't think I'm worthy...
- I think you are.

149
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,340
He can if he gets into
the finals, right?

150
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,270
[What performance will Sam give as
he received You Hee-yeol's teachings?]

[The studio breaks into applause]

157
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:56,360
Going to Antenna Music...

158
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,740
That was luck.

159
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:05,900
You made remarkable progress in both your
guitar playing and singing in the past 3 weeks.

160
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Antenna Music taught you well and you
practiced hard. Both were combined.

161
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:20,540
You made the most amazing progress
out of all in this battle audition.

162
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,180
I suddenly had this thought.

163
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,660
Interludes disappeared from all music
starting from the late 1990s.

164
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,630
You're right.

165
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:51,030
Since everyone is in such
a hurry in life...

166
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,620
They change the radio station
when the interlude comes in.

167
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,030
Verse 2 comes right after verse 1.
Interlude is gone from all gayo.

168
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,960
I want to listen to the
interlude when Sam plays.

169
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,630
I want to listen to his guitar
between verses 1 and 2.

170
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,690
And...

171
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,060
Before he started rapping,
I used to say this to Bernard...

172
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,580
Doing a minor ad-lib
in a major song...

173
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,560
It's amazing, but the contestants this time...
Did you make him? Did you teach him that?

174
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,280
[It's our little secret]

175
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,090
I was surprised and
you also rapped well.

176
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,910
It was a fresh jolt.
I enjoyed it.

177
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,280
I think the same as JYP.

178
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,490
This was your best
solo performance.

179
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,610
That was some good planning.
I didn't expect him to rap.

180
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,260
He rapped well since he has
an excellent sense of groove.

181
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:08,050
He met You Hee-yeol, a great teacher,
and learned the guitar from Ham Chun-ho.

182
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:18,770
He made great strides in his sense of
rhythm that I have nothing to point out.

183
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,530
Good job.

184
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,840
[What is You Hee-yeol's commentary
since he trained Sam himself?]

185
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,360
You did well.

186
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,250
Your beats are better.

187
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,830
You're not in a hurry
and now composed.

188
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,910
We fixed one thing
we wanted to fix.

189
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,460
You sound hoarse.

190
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,020
I practiced especially hard...

191
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:57,580
I'm saying this because there were
two fantastic high parts.

192
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,020
But he couldn't sing them.

193
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:07,520
You two would have loved it more
but he couldn't because of his voice.

194
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,300
But I want to compliment him for hiding
that naturally with techniques.

195
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,020
That was a relief.

196
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,520
And your dieting is
showing results.

197
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,690
He used to look like this
but he's dieting right now.

198
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,220
Continue to not eat (joke).

199
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,960
Today was good.

200
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,730
The next contestant is...

201
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,250
I'm worried because the
previous contestant did well.

202
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,690
They are without a rival and received
compliments one after another.

203
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,690
No contestant received more
compliments than them.

204
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,950
They kept on shocking
the judges.

205
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,540
[Everyone wants to
avoid the Shorties]

206
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,710
[Recognized as YG's main players]

207
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,430
[But they are more burdened
because Sam was complimented]

208
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:05,460
Any difficulties or inconveniences
during your stay at YGE?

209
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,900
Our song changed 3 days ago.

210
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:18,800
It was hard but thanks to YG who
helped us until late last night...

211
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,390
We kept our spirits up
and did our best.

212
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,080
JYP gave his opinion to do a different
song during the warm-up match...

213
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,000
- "I Know"?
- Yes, it was that song.

214
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,860
I wanted them to go with it, but I didn't
think it was the one 3 days ago.

215
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,560
I asked, "I'm really sorry, but
can you change the song?"

216
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,520
They're in a crisis.

217
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,030
They used to sing songs that
they practiced on for weeks.

218
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,460
But today, they have to present
what they prepared for 3 days.

219
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,590
I'm saying this so the viewers and
judges can take that into account.

220
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,050
[But...]

221
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,610
[They can't hear anything because
they're memorizing the lyrics...]

222
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:17,060
Since JYP told us to
supplement the song...

223
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,990
We thought of making this song
complete and stuck to it...

224
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,120
[Battle audition
T-minus 3 days]

225
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,590
[YG's final inspection]

226
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,130
[They're singing passionately
on what they have practiced]

227
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,530
[He feels it isn't enough]

228
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,290
It doesn't sound good.
This is a big problem.

229
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,450
[They're struggling with the song
itself with only 3 days left]

230
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,650
It's a difficult task to
work out this song.

231
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,930
I think we have to change our plans
instead of sticking to this song.

232
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:07,040
I think it's better to change into something
you're good at. What do you think?

233
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,340
We've been struggling with
this for several weeks.

234
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,710
But it isn't working out.

235
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,490
It may be hard...

236
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,820
But change the song and
stop thinking about this.

237
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,480
Throw away what's bad and
don't even hang on to it.

238
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,370
Based on my experiences.
Understand?

239
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,780
You'll do well. You've been
doing great until now.

240
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,700
[But...]

241
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:40,490
We were speechless. What song
can we prepare in 3 days?

242
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,670
[They competed with longer hours
of practice than other teams...]

243
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,270
[They don't even have
the time to worry]

244
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:50,620
Thinking about the composition
and harmony drove us crazy.

245
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:59,930
We stayed in the practice room
very late into the night.

246
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:05,320
We put all our concentration into
creating the harmonies.

247
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:15,810
It's a pity that we couldn't change
some parts due to the lack of time.

248
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,920
[Why are the judges surprised?]

249
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:30,490
I'm surprised by George Michael's "Faith"
as much as "I Know." How will this be...

250
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,070
This song is even harder
than "I Know."

251
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,040
[The exciting guitar accompaniment
stands out in George Michael's "Faith"]

252
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,340
- It's a repetition of 3 chords...
- I know. How will they do this?

253
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,780
I'm afraid and excited.

254
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,760
We'll listen with a
joyful heart. Good luck.

255
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,010
Thank you.

256

[Will they overcome this hardship
and advance to the TOP10?]

257

[Faith - George Michael]

258
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,490

without the accompaniment]

259

sharply than before]

260
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,280
[Changes into an exciting
and bright mood]

[What is their commentary?]

263
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,210
Do you think I'm going to say
something good or bad?

264
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,360
You used very complex chords when
you had only 3 days to practice.

265
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,310
[They're pointed out
for the first time!]

266
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:53,880
You went down 4 semitones
from the first degree.

267
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,960
That's really...

268
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,330
It becomes a dissonance
if it isn't exactly right.

269
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,910
So...

270
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:06,520
To get to the point,
it was a lack of practice.

271
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,370
[What they feared came true]

272
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:17,120
You could have used simple and rhythmical
chords but you're not content with that.

273
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,990
You had to get all of those
complex chords in 3 days.

274
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,410
It was unstable throughout the song.

275
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,390
[What is You Hee-yeol's commentary
since he always complimented them?]

276
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,550
It was unstable, right?

277
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,950
[Another objective observation]

278
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,050
Because you went off slightly...

279
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:51,000
I started to incline my ears,
"What is that chord?"

280
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,900
So, at first... what
was the first key?

281
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
E-flat.

282
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:03,650
Then it was a D-flat, C, and B.

283
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:11,170
Since you didn't sing it correctly,
a semitone became a whole tone.

284
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,530
I knew after hearing the piano.

285
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,830
Second, there were too
many key changes.

286
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:26,720
You kept on changing the key
to try to change the melody.

287
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,160
That made it sound unstable.

288
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,220
The composition this time
was a bit discursive.

289
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,230
[They're being pointed out
for the first time]

290

[What is YG's commentary
since he trained them?]

291
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:51,390
I casted them because I like them but
I feel sorry for not giving much help.

292
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,990
They would have had more time
if I told them to change early on.

293
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,430
I wanted to trust you
all the way.

294
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:08,260
JYP said it should be changed
and we changed it a week later.

295
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:13,090
It was a pity so
I feel sorry.

296
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:20,800
I would like to compliment that it was
good for something prepared in 3 days.

297

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,050
Let's start the next battle.

337
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,520
Complete Chae from JYP.

338
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,420
Something from Antenna Music.

339
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,280
Jang Hanna from YG.

340
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,130
[It's hard to predict the outcome!]

341
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,860
Please enter the stage.

342
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,110
[The fourth group enters!]

343
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:48,390
We went against Something
once during Round 3.

344
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:53,820
We were surprised and worried
that we're battling them again.

345
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,370
[A fated rematch where they meet
again at the battle audition!]

346
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:01,500
We're battling them again...
It was a big shock...

347
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,080
I want to laugh and
not cry this time.

348
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,440
I thought it would be
against female vocalists.

349
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,330
Since I'm alone...
I'm worried.

350
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,220
[An unprecedented battle
will now unfold!]

351
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,820
[Completely different
colors and genres!]

352
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,620
[An unpredictable battle
between teams!]

[Who will take the honor of
advancing as the 4th finalist?]

354
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,490
Hanna, who are you?

355
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:36,110
[The elegant black dress makes her
beauty to stand out even more]

356
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,580
You transformed beautifully.

357
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,520
What do you think
of your image?

358
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,980
[She's suddenly
brimming with tears...]

359
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,310
Did you cry?

360
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,580
Oh, it's because they
were eliminated.

361
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,710
I forced 2Minute to split...

362
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,430
She had to see them off...

363
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:10,140
[The moment when her
friends were eliminated]

364
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,070
[She wiped away her
tears in silence...]

365
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,120
Hanna?

366
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,920
You might feel sad
right now but...

367
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,910
The greatest gift you can give them is
doing well and taking 1st place, right?

368
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,950
Just as JYP said, I thought you
were a model when you walked out.

369
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,750
- I was surprised.
- Your clothes look great.

370
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,620
YGE is very good at styling.

371
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,490
Black mesh!

372
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,730
I wore that a lot in 1994.

373
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,070
[She regained her laughter
thanks to the judges' joke]

374
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:50,690
One interesting thing about this battle is
All Chae and Something battled before.

375
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:54,040
And Se-woon was eliminated.

376
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,450
Complete Chae won before so
are you more confident?

377
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,340
It's a bit different than before...

378
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,720
[When opponents were
announced a few hours ago]

379
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,400
No way!

380
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:18,050
The moment it was announced...
it was really shocking.

381
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,830
[After the announcement]

382
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:24,360
[Chae-yeon cries due to the
burden of having a rematch]

383
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,860
- Are you crying because of me?
- Yes, it's because of you.

384
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,200
I don't know what to do.

385
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,050
[It's a heartless rematch where
they can only comfort each other]

386
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,640
[But they have another difficulty...]

387
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,030
[Song choice! What song
are they singing?]

388
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,750
[JYP's special recommendation!]

389
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,740
[The powerful dance stands out
in Rain's "It's Raining"]

390
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,030
"It's Raining" is hard
even for male singers.

391
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:01,060
The moves are large, but it has
to be precise with power.

392
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,940
Until now, they did light
dances out of enjoyment.

393
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:13,000
Doing a dance they never did before and
singing while doing an intense dance...

394
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,830
I wanted them to gain
something from that.

395
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,080
[Training by JYP the day
after the casting audition]

396
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,230
After watching the music video,
do you think you can do it?

397
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,830
We made up some moves
according to our feeling.

398
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,830
You made your own moves?
That's admirable.

399
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,510
[They show the moves they made
according to their feeling]

400
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,360
[JYP suddenly stops the music]

401
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,120
Learn the original moves first.

402
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:49,290
It'll be a shock if you
do the original dance.

403
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,610
This isn't an easy dance for you.

404
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,850
The dance is a powerful dance.

405
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:02,400
I'm worried if women can do this
since it was made for men.

406
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,250
There are a lot of moves. I'm worried if
we can sing and dance at the same time...

407
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,180
This is hard!

408
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:19,970
The song is fast, the lyrics are long,
and there are no parts to breathe.

409
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,050
We practiced thinking,
"Can we do this?"

410
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,820
[Practice to make the
impossible possible!]

411
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,910
[Practice... again... and again...]

412
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,070
[Even during the interview for
the Lunar New Year Special]

413
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,780
[They don't rest and are
absorbed in practicing!]

414
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,040
[They practiced regardless
of time and place]

415
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,670
After getting casted, we rested
only twice during the past 3 weeks.

416
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,630
We are truly something.

417
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,320
[They commend themselves]

418
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:00,570
It was the best when JYP
trained us personally.

419
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:06,850
He gave us good advices on
how to put in feeling.

420
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:16,790
Please watch how we'll dance the
powerful dance made for men.

421

423
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,150
Yes?

424
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:40,410
It's okay even though you
two are eliminated, right?

425
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,040
Yes.

426
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,650
You're still young and
have many things to do.

427
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:47,790
Just enjoy yourselves
whether you pass or not.

428
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:48,700
Good luck!

429
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,930

with an earnest heart]

[What are the judges' commentaries?]

435
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,110
I think You Hee-yeol should go first
since he knows the least about dancing.

436
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,650
[How did he see them?]

437
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:50,860
Now I know just this much how the dance
differs from before as I keep on seeing you.

438
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:54,290
You used to sing and
dance separately.

439
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,270
But today you had to sing
while doing intense moves.

440
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:02,520
Despite the difficulty, there's
now power in your dance...

441
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:08,290
And it went smoothly without
running out of breath while singing.

442
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:15,950
Before, I mainly watched the unstable elements,
how you were young and without habits.

443
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:23,100
I think you overcame those
weaknesses in this performance.

444
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,680
Thank you.

445
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,080
[The ones waiting are
getting nervous...]

446

[What is YG's commentary
who is a dancing legend?]

447
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,740
Do you think I'll say
something good or bad?

448
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,880
I'm asking JYP.

449
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,830
[Please say something good]

450
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:54,540
Just looking at the dance...

451
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:02,440
I think you have skills to be
Rain's background dancers.

452
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:11,300
Another thing is that I have
complaints about this show.

453
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:20,350
Even for pros, harmony is added in the
background music for dance music.

454
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:28,440
They're not singing solo. There's harmony
in this song but even that was removed.

455
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,380
There are recording techniques
such as doubling and stacking...

456
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:43,830
But it's hard for their singing to sound
nice after removing that from the song.

457
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,520
I'm worried since I have
affection for them...

458
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,670
[Worried?]

459
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:59,330
They made it this far with potential but
now we're choosing the TOP10 finalists.

460
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:04,040
If they do become finalists, the other
nine are very strong opponents.

461
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:11,080
More emphasis will be placed on
singing and not on dancing.

462
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:19,730
I'm worried that they are at a
disadvantage in singing.

463
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:24,810
Putting aside whether they're good or not,
it's my wish that they can go far.

464
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:33,300
I said this so the viewers can keep in mind
that it's hard to sing while dancing.

465
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,810
- You did well.
- Thank you.

466
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:43,620
[What is JYP's commentary?]

467
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,020
As a producer who was with you
during practice, you did very well.

468
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,870
You were better than expected.

469
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,910
Thank you.

470
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:59,380
Singing is difficult when
the lower body is moving.

471
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:02,020
Singing while moving the
upper body is easy...

472
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:08,020
It's really hard when the lower body is moving
because the center of balance is off, but...

473
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,720
It's amazing that they
could sing like that.

474
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,130
You sang very well.

475
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:15,360
Thank you.

476
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:22,160
That was as a producer.
But now as a judge...

477
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,410
You were singing hard like
"I have to sing well."

478
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:33,670
That's from a realistic standpoint
without taking your age into account.

479
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,160
But what you did was
amazing for your age.

480
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,080

What we expect the most
from Something is...

484

Their own songs. That's what
I personally think as well.

485
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:13,110
Since both of you have a
strong tendency as artists...

really anxious is...

490

Something has to write
their own song.

491

The others can go straight to
practice when the song is decided.

492
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:44,130
But they have to write their song
and it can't be done in a day.

493
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:46,160
And they both need to write it.

494
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,980

are boring so we focused mainly on that.

were stressed in writing the song.

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:35,450
We used to write it quickly but
it took longer this time.

505
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,230
[A few days later]

506
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,740
[They present their
somewhat completed song]

507
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,000
[What did Kim Yeon-woo,
the god of vocals, think?]

508
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,240
They wrote this?

509
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,790
It's very good.

510
00:52:52,790 --> 00:52:55,190
[Unexpected compliments from
Kim Yeon-woo and ALi!]

511
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,410
[Feels proud]

512
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:01,500
We were exhausted from
thinking about the melody.

513
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,910
It strengthened us when they said it was
good and the rest was smooth sailing.

514
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:11,720
If their song is bad,
the results will be bad...

515
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:18,730
Fortunately, I think this can be
the title track of their album.

516
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:21,040
[Will they receive favorable
comments as he hopes?]

517
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:26,770
[What is their song?]

518
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,110
[You Hee-yeol feels like
he's being judged too]

519
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:39,190
[Excuse Me - own song]

520
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,670
[The guitar riff
makes them smile]

521
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:56,180
Where am I?

522
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:02,980
I fell asleep because it was warm
And it's already the last stop

523
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:09,500
Where should I go?

524
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:15,870
I know that you're busy but
Can I ask for directions?

525
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:21,880
People are passing by
Color of an unfamiliar city

526
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:29,750
I'm placed in the middle
Standing absently

527
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:36,030
Please repeat it to me again
I'm not good with directions

528
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:42,000
Could you tell me kindly?
You speak a little fast

529
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:03,180
Where am I?

530
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:09,350
I'm in love for the first time
I need directions

531
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,710
Where should I go?

532
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:21,250
I know that you're busy but
Can I ask for directions?

533
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:28,160
Oh, wait a minute please
I think that I'm lost

534
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:36,530
Since that day, I've been
Lingering around you

535
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:42,890
Please repeat it to me again
I don't know much about love

536
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:48,960
Could you tell me kindly?
It's hard to understand you

537
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:14,160
[They seem pleased]

538
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,670
[But...]

539
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,260
[The judges don't look satisfied]

540
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,110
[What are their commentaries?]

541
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,200
[YG grabs the mike first]

542
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:31,460
I personally like JYP.

543
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,690
And I personally like You Hee-yeol
as we got to know each other.

544
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:46,500
But I'm putting personal feelings aside
because I need to judge precisely.

545
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:51,090
I'll say what I saw and felt.

546
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:54,200
[What is he going to say?]

547
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:00,820
Before you began, I said that
I had high hopes for you as artists.

548
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,200
I watched your performance
as I read the lyrics.

549
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:14,910
Writing your own song is great but
it's simple without being unique.

550
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:19,300
[Harsh criticism that went
against expectations!]

551
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,120
The lyrics are about losing
direction and wandering.

552
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:28,230
But the words I expected
are listed here.

553
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:33,350
As the round advances,
our expectations grow.

554
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:38,130
This is not the preliminaries anymore.
The TOP10 finalists are being decided.

555
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:42,530
There has to be unexpected lyrics
that catch us off guard.

556
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,260
I was being frank.

557
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,710
[The commentaries are merciless
since this is the TOP10 prematch!]

558
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,270
[Next is JYP]

559
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:01,790
A good song and a hit song
are two different things.

560
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,110
[What does he mean?]

561
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:09,500
All the songs you sang
until now were good songs.

562
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,700
They had a unique sentiment.

563
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,110
And the ideas were novel.

564
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:21,200
The subject and materials
are great but...

565
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,540
It doesn't taste good
when you start cooking.

566
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,860
[It doesn't taste good?]

567
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:35,990
The idea of comparing how you're lost
to being lost in love is great.

568
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:39,930
But your ability to
work that out...

569
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:43,290
Compared to an hour-long drama...

570
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:49,360
It could be explained in 20 minutes
but you used up the entire hour.

571
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,260
We're immersed in verse 1
then it goes...

572
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:01,640
That's the common thing
in all the past rounds.

573
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:10,330
But I wrote worse than you at that age.
I wanted to tell you that at least.

574
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,710
[It hurts but it was a
heartfelt commentary]

575
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,520
[Their second harsh criticism!]

576
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,040
[The contestants are
getting more tense...]

577
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:27,840
The two judges severely
pointed things out.

578
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:35,380
They told you that as senior artists
so please take that to heart.

579
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,420
Since they said such things,
I will compliment you.

580
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,440
First...

581
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,200
The previous songs
were very unique.

582
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,770
I like this song because
it has universality.

583
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:58,830
And among the commentaries you
received for the lyrics was...

584
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,070
The lyrics are too personal.

585
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:05,850
You were reproved because they
couldn't understand what you're saying.

586
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:10,980
You tried to tell your
story this time...

587
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,140
But you also tried to consider
the hearts of the listeners.

588
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:20,870
That's one of the things
I would like to compliment.

589
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:29,320
What they said is that you shouldn't
lose your color in your musical career.

590
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,010
Do you understand?

591
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,230
- You did well.
- Thank you.

592
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:43,100
[What is their fate after getting
unexpected harsh criticisms?]

593
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:47,070
Next is Jang Hanna.

594
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:50,790
[YG's Jang Hanna]

595
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,250
[She looks a little tense]

596
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:03,450
This song is...

597
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,050
[Is it unexpected?]

598
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:07,080
I never expected this.

599
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,130
I love this song.

600
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,230
But it's not from my generation.
It was when I was young.

601
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:18,250
I recall I was in the 8th grade.
I used to record it on cassette.

602
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,220
["As Like the Smiling Face on Parting"
Lee Eun-ha's classic song from 1986]

603
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,860
One of the reasons why
I like Jang Hanna's voice...

604
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:31,030
She has a very soulful voice.

605
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:34,640
Aren't you looking forward
to hear her sing gayo?

606
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:37,080
[The song was chosen out of
YG's ambitious expectations...]

607
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,510
[She was separated from the team
and it was especially hard on her]

608
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,940
[Her 2Minute members]

609
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,910
We did things together
and now I'm alone so...

610
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,620
I feel sad.

611
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:02,290
[YG prepared a surprise gift
since she's having a hard time...]

612
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,960
[Lee Hi!]

613
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:19,690
I was practicing but
someone suddenly came in.

614
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:25,660
I was taken aback because it was
Lee Hi and my face became red.

615
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:28,110
Expression! You know
that feeling.

616
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:32,940
We're the same age so
we talked comfortably.

617
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:39,470
She taught me how to do the beginning
part since she did this a lot.

618
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:42,380
That became a great support
so I think I'll do well.

619
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:44,770
[And on the day of the audition...]

620
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:48,160
Good luck. Looks like you're
taking two exams, huh?

621
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:50,360
[Unfortunately, the written exam for
college overlapped with the audition]

622
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:56,480
I'm taking my entrance exam today
and also going to the audition.

623
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,050
I'm really nervous
and burdened.

624
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:01,800
[2014 practical exam placement]

625
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:06,940
[She finishes the written exam
and heads for the audition!]

626
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:11,290
[She arrived 3 hours late
than the other contestants]

627
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:16,440
[She found out who her
opponents are]

628
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:20,300
It's going to be Something
and Complete Chae.

629
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,090
[She was unmistakably startled
by the unexpected opponents]

630
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:28,020
I've been enjoying
it until now.

631
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:31,170
I couldn't understand when
they said that it was hard.

632
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:37,500
But now I understand
as I came this far.

633
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,420
[She became close with the 2Minute members
but at the news of their elimination...]

634
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:50,290
[She wiped away her tears backstage
when she heard the news]

635
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:53,850
[Her day was especially
long and tiring]

636
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:57,730
[She tried to hold back the tears
before entering the stage]

637
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:01,070
[How will her long day end?]

638
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,790
[Her mother in the waiting room]

639
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,140
[As Like the Smiling Face
on Parting - Lee Eun-ha]

640
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:56,550
[She gets into the rhythm
naturally with the tempo change]

641
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:21,400
[It was a long day, but she tries to
stay true to the emotions of the song]

642
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:41,520
[She gave the song some change
according to her feeling]

643
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:32,240
Thank you.

644
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,190
[She does her best and finishes]

645
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,210
[What will be her commentary?]

646
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,170
[The mood is serious]

647
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:47,640
[You Hee-yeol grabs
the mike first]

648
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,490
[Did her long day have an adverse
effect on her performance?]

649
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:59,850
First, the arrangement
was done very well.

650
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:05,620
It's not easy to sing this
song with just the piano.

651
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,350
You interpreted the song well
apart from your singing skills.

652
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,900
There's one thing...

653
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:20,670
You're not a jazz vocalist.

654
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:29,800
It felt like you were imitating one in
your vibration and breathing in the end.

655
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:35,160
You had the feel but was a
singer for a different genre.

656
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,440
You did well.

657
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,280
[An unexpected objective
commentary]

658
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:45,670
I...

659
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:50,980
Agree with the second part
of what You Hee-yeol said.

660
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:55,730
I don't know who you are
all of a sudden.

661
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:04,910
When you started doing that,
I thought, "Who is this?"

662
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,980
The thing about you is...

663
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:15,570
You sang honestly and correctly,
but still had that feeling.

664
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,480
There's no need to
adorn yourself.

665
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,920
But as you adorned your
pronunciation and voice...

666
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:27,070
The impression that came from your
innocence, honesty, and talent is gone.

667
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:30,010
Only the talent remained.

668
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:35,480
I would like to say
that's my fault.

669
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,140
[What happened?]

670
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,340
I saw her singing
during practice...

671
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:45,700
She was singing honestly.

672
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:51,210
I said she needed her color
and to be more unique.

673
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:55,880
She just expressed it
in a wrong way.

674
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,170
That came out first because
she was thinking on what I said.

675
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:02,700
And her honesty hid behind that.
I think that was the case.

676
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:10,540
Every time I see her I think,
"She can do better than that."

677
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:13,500
But Jang Hanna...

678
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,370
When will she unleash it?

679
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,770
I'm losing my temper.

680
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:21,760
[She did her best but her commentary
leaves much to be desired]

681
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:25,910
[Who will take first place
and who will be eliminated?]

682
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:30,860
Will the others join
her on stage?

683
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:38,410
[Their paths will separate when
the judges finish their discussion!]

684
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,780
[It's hard for them to
reach a conclusion...]

685
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:54,020
Production crew!

686
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,370
[They suddenly call the
production crew]

687
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,190
[Why is the discussion
getting longer?]

688
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:10,610
[They're talking about
something seriously!]

689
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,870
[The serious discussion is over]

690
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:20,170
[YG sits down with
a long face]

691
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:24,490
[What is the result of
the discussion?]

692
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:30,240
The discussion ran long.

693
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,870
We three judges had
conflicting opinions.

694
01:10:36,610 --> 01:10:40,490
In Season 3...

695
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:46,640
It's no exaggeration to say that
this is an unprecedented situation.

696
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,550
We have a shocking result.

697
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,810
Unfortunately...

698
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:59,140
Today's 1st place is...

699
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:01,120
No one.

700
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:05,240
[Does that mean that
they're all eliminated?]

701
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:15,880
That means none of you met or
went beyond our expectations.

702
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,820
We had another concern.

703
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:27,430
Who should take 3rd place?
Who should be eliminated?

704
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:40,520
It was hard to decide on 3rd place
because you were all similar.

705
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,650
Today's 3rd place is...

706
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,080
No one.

707
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,570
[There's no 3rd place?]

708
01:11:51,570 --> 01:11:55,130
[What does this mean?]

709
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:09,150
We decided that all of you
should have a rematch.

710
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:13,080
[An unprecedented situation
with no 1st or 3rd place!]

711
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:20,520
I can't congratulate you
or say that I'm upset.

712
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:25,120
As you leave the stage,
give this a lot of thought.

713
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,480
You can't do it
like this again.

714
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,450
Just think that
you're eliminated.

715
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:35,550
Think that you're eliminated
and just enjoy yourselves.

716
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,460
Think that you're going to
show something and go home.

717
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:45,430
You need this mindset, "Elimination is
fine, but I'm going to show something."

718
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:48,360
Go and get ready.

719
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,240
- Good job.
- Thank you.

720
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,320
[They're shocked as
they leave the stage]

721
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:02,840
It would have been okay if I did it
like how I did during the rehearsal.

722
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:08,140
[It doesn't look like her
long day is over yet!]

723
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,460
We kept in mind on the things
pointed out and made this song.

724
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:18,050
But it was pointed out even more.

725
01:13:18,050 --> 01:13:19,790
I'm at a loss.

726
01:13:19,790 --> 01:13:22,100
It's complicated.

727
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,570
[All three teams enter the
2nd place waiting room!]

728
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:27,360

something to watch!]

[What will be the final outcome
of the battle audition?]

730
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:37,210
Let's start the 5th battle.
Heejun Han from YG.

731
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:42,190
I'm burdened with all of them.
Feels like my head will explode.

732
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:45,580
Brody B from JYP.

733
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:52,610
Peter Han from Antenna Music.

734
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:59,430
Heejun's really good. He's a
singer but I'm an amateur.

735
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:01,460
I don't know...

736
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,700
Please enter the stage.

737

[Brody's extreme makeover!]

738
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:18,170
They're different
as night and day.

739
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:22,210
This is just...

740
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:27,670
[Battle between the best
looking from the 3 agencies]

741
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,960
You look cool and pretty.

742
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,630
[Who will advance
to the TOP10?]

743
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:39,770
[Awkward]

744
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:52,680
The peculiar thing about this
group is that they're from abroad.

745
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:55,050
Heejun is a former
American Idol finalist.

746
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:59,880
Brody came from the US
and stole our hearts.

747
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,490
And Peter Han is from Austria.

748
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:07,260
Their music genre is also completely
different. I can't imagine what...

749
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:11,900
Especially Brody. I can't even
guess what she's going to do.

750
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,360
I see that it's a secret.

751
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,020
[It's a secret!]

752
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,580
I think it's best for us to talk
after watching their performance.

753
01:15:26,580 --> 01:15:34,550
Antenna Music's Peter Han
will be going first.

754
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,450
- He's good-looking.
- He sure is.

755
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,360
- Don't girls like that face?
- Absolutely!

756
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:54,400
Wow... a Fender amp and guitar...

757
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:57,500
[A setting rousing anticipation!]

758
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:10,920
Peter could become a jazz singer like
Michael Buble which is rare in Korea.

759
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,950
So we focused on that.

760
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:17,300
He was always complimented on that
but never did such a performance.

761
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,470
I'm singing John Park's
"This Ain't It."

762
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:28,600
You Hee-yeol told me to sing
the jazz I always wanted to.

763
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:33,080
So I'm doing a jazz standard.

for him to understand]

- This is how you're singing.
- This is not speaking...

[He's motivated before
the gods of vocals!]

772
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:06,150
Do it like this or
do it like that.

773
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:09,380

You'll put on a black suit
with a skinny tie.

- Oh! A suit!
- He's loving it!

778

It'll be like Frank Sinatra.

780

You Hee-yeol said I'm always clean-cut
so I have to show my talents.

781
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:41,390
I'm finally able to show off
jazz sentiments.

782
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:44,780
There are high notes and
even a guitar solo.

783
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:49,380
I will show off my talents.

Your high notes are open now.
You gained a lot with that alone.

796
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:30,930
As JYP said, you were able to sing the
high notes after coming on this show.

797
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:32,900
It's completely open.

798
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,620
[He has now mastered
the high notes]

799
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:40,080
It's completely open but all
the high notes sound the same.

800
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:52,240
I thought it would be better
if there were some dynamics.

801
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,520
It's like this.

802
01:20:55,520 --> 01:21:01,550
You have to be a seasoned
jazz singer to sing this well.

803
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:07,840
You have to keep on
singing such songs.

804
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:14,710
And when it's fully ripened, only
then can you sing this genre.

805

You just learned vocalization
for the first time here.

806

It's impossible for you to sing
such a song with dynamics.

You were nervous, right?

808
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:43,930
I could feel it from here.

809
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:48,130
I like it when you sing but
also when you play the guitar.

810
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,590
Me too.

811
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:54,520
Maybe it's influence from your
parents that you can play like this...

Musical nourishment is overflowing
both within your body and soul.

Yes, I personally like this song.

821

I wrote this for Kim Bum-soo.

- You wrote it?

823

Yes.

824
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,740
Then I shouldn't have
let him sing this.

825
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:08,570
I told him to do it without
knowing it was JYP's song.

[During YG's mid-evaluation]

835

836
01:24:02,670 --> 01:24:08,200
We all know that you're good.
You have to convey your heart now.

sincerity into singing]

838

Sincerity...

840
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,620
I didn't know it was this hard.

841
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:21,690
Singing well is not enough.

842
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:25,490
I have to touch the heart
but that is...

843
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:32,730
The hardest thing was that
people misunderstood me.

844
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:38,550
I did my best on every stage
but people say I calculated it.

845
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:42,470
For example, my lips are quivering
and I'm really nervous but...

846
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:45,570
I couldn't understand when they said,
"Why are you pretending to be nervous?"

847
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:51,630
It was hard that there was
no rock to hide under.

848
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:58,680
To answer YG's question
of "Who are you?"...

849
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:04,090
I went to where I was born.
I was born in Anyang.

850
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:09,590
It was Seoksu-dong, Anyang.
The house isn't there anymore.

851
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:15,560
I went around and visited
the video store I frequented.

852
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:18,990
I called my mom to confirm if
the places I went to were correct.

853
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:25,620
I was touched, I don't know why,
and I felt warm inside.

854
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:35,920
I felt freedom from all my exhaustion
in a city I haven't visited in decades.

855
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:42,170
It seems I did exaggerate because
I tried to sing what I didn't experience.

856
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:49,710
So I thought about what song
would fit my circumstances.

857
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:53,320
There was a song called "Passing"
and I listened to the lyrics.

858
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,590
It really came to me.

859
01:25:55,590 --> 01:26:03,430
"This pain will pass. How much more
do I need to cry for that bright day."

860
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:05,860
It fit my circumstances.

861
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:14,350
Since it perfectly explains my situation,
I think my sincerity will exude from it.

862
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,060
[He's more nervous than ever]

863
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:22,850
[Can his sincerity move
the judges' heart?]

864
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:34,290
[Passing - Kim Bum-soo]

865
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,390
[How hard must it be and]

866
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:32,260
[How much do I need to cry]

867
01:27:32,260 --> 01:27:38,460
[For me to smile again]

868
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:49,550
[It'll pass]

869
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:54,850
[This pain will end]

870
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:27,520
[He put all his energy
and sang passionately]

871
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:32,540
[They lavish him with applause]

872
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,130
[But JYP is unable to speak]

873
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:18,080
The first thought I had
when I listened is...

874
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:21,620
I want to give him a song.

875
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:24,090
[The best compliment a
producer can give!]

876
01:30:25,020 --> 01:30:27,540
I never had that thought until now.

877
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,410
I just thought you were good
and a pro in auditions.

878
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:36,950
Since you have experience from the
more competitive American Idol...

879
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:40,220
I'm sorry to say this,
but I was biased.

880
01:30:40,220 --> 01:30:45,730
But for the first time today,
when you sang the first measure...

881
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:53,450
You have a tone that is
suitable for ballads.

882
01:30:53,450 --> 01:31:00,010
So I thought how well you'll
act if a song is given.

883
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:04,260
Actors act with expression whereas
singers act with their voice.

884
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:06,950
You act very well.

885
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:12,150
I know what these lyrics
are trying to say.

886
01:31:12,150 --> 01:31:13,790
It was good.

887
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,750
[He's slowly realizing how
to sing with his heart]

888
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,900
I...

889
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:33,460
I can't hide my expression
when I like something.

890
01:31:35,270 --> 01:31:37,930
When you sang the first measure...

891
01:31:37,930 --> 01:31:42,480
I wasn't unresponsive
because it was bad.

892
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:50,870
I suddenly had the chills and
couldn't move until it was over.

893
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:54,750
It was as if you were speaking.

894
01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:59,530
I was really sick and had a bad
fever when I wrote this song.

895
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,210
I was in the US and
it was snowing outside.

896
01:32:03,210 --> 01:32:05,530
You know how you feel sad
when you're really sick...

897
01:32:05,530 --> 01:32:11,600
I endured with that one thought,
"I will get better from this cold."

898
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,530
That's when I wrote this.

899
01:32:14,530 --> 01:32:22,330
I started thinking about that time
when I was sick and writing this.

900
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:28,390
I was immersed and couldn't move
as if I went back to that time.

901
01:32:28,390 --> 01:32:31,560
It was an amazing performance
since I couldn't judge properly.

902
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:42,570
For the first time, you didn't
sing to try to look good.

903
01:32:42,570 --> 01:32:51,550
It was as if you were telling
your story. You spat it out.

904
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:54,450
I really enjoyed it
and it was moving.

905
01:32:54,450 --> 01:32:55,690
Thank you.

906
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,120
[And YG's commentary?]

907
01:33:08,180 --> 01:33:12,350
Now I know who you are.

908
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:25,680
I thought you shined the most in
this performance than any other.

909
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:30,670
I feel proud as a producer
and judge. Good job.

910
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:36,570
[His compliment was short but
it was much more meaningful]

911
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:44,090
["Sincerity" is what he
wanted to hear the most]

912
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:49,000
[He feels as if all those times
were being compensated]

913
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,480
Next up is Brody.

914
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,840
[JYP's Brody (11)]

915
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:04,400
I look forward to
what she'll do.

916
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:07,570
She'll either sink or swim.

917
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:16,350
JYP must have given
much thought.

918
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:19,650
[A smile of satisfaction?]

919
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:30,560
[What is their fate in this
intense battle audition?]

920
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:36,498

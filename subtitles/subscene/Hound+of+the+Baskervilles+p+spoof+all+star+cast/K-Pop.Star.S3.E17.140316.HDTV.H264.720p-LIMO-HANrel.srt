00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,680
This is Survival Audition
KPOP STAR Season 3!

3
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,780
I introduce you to the TOP8 finalists
that advanced to the live stage!

4
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,320
A warm round of applause for them
that made it after 8 long months!

5
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,590
Happy to be here.
I'm greeting you live.

6
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,880
Welcome to the first live stage
for KPOP STAR Season 3.

7
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,390
I'm Jun Hyun-moo the
mascot for KPOP STAR.

8
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,130
Glad to be here.

9
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,730
They were chosen by the three judges and
the audience judging panel last week.

10
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,930
These 8 teams received the honor
of performing on the live stage.

11
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,270
Since they came this far
after a fierce competition...

12
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,950
We look forward to their
performances today.

13
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,890
There will be 5 live shows
including the one today.

14
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:49,200
Then Season 3's winner
will be determined.

15
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,410
Please tune in to all 5 shows!

16
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,410
The winner of KPOP STAR Season 3
will be awarded a cash prize of $300,000.

17
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,070
And receive a mid-size and
compact diesel sedan.

18
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,800
I'll introduce the three judges that are
gaining as much attention as the finalists.

19
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,410
They're like parents.

20
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:17,840
First is JYPE's Park Jin-young!

21
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,310
YGE's Yang Hyun-suk!

22
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,790
Antenna Music's You Hee-yeol!

23
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,930
Good to see you three.

24
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:38,520
You must be pleased looking
at the TOP8 finalists.

25
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,250
They should be nervous right now.
Any words for them, YG?

26
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:52,220
JYP is currently a singer and You Hee-yeol
hosts a live show so they're less nervous.

27
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,530
I do a live show only once a year
and that is here on KPOP STAR.

28
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:03,270
They must be really nervous since my heart
was pounding before coming up here.

29
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,140
They might not see
or hear anything.

30
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,880
All of you made it this far
because you are all good.

31
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,740
Please give us a good performance.

32
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,040
Thank you.

33
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,750
You Hee-yeol is on this live show
for the first time with me.

34
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,670
Are you nervous?

35
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:25,780
Yes, I wasn't able to sleep.

36
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,880
You weren't able to sleep again?

37
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,810
I'm getting thinner.

38
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,140
But they must be more nervous.
Why don't we give them a hand?

39
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,130
I see you're trying to
make them relax.

40
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,090
And don't cry You Hee-yeol
because this is live.

41
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:54,850
JYP, I heard there's a reason why
this season has the most tension.

42
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:07,270
It's because the winner of this season
gets to announce their agency of choice.

43
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,160
So we three judges are nervous.

44
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,600
I think I should talk less about their
bad points and start complimenting.

45
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,620
I guess you'll finally
understand how they feel.

46
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,300
Starting this season, the judges will
be waiting desperately to get picked.

47
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,230
We'll now begin today's battle.

48
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,430
Curious? I'll show you
how it's done.

49
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,120
Let's watch how the
battle is done.

50
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900

the live show]

52
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,750
OMG! He scared me!

53
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,450
[Surprise appearance by
MC Jun Hyun-moo]

54
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,420
I'm happy to see you. Congratulations
and give yourselves a big hand.

55
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,910
[Congratulations to the TOP8]

56
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:07,430
Do you have any idea
why you are here?

57
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,690
This week is the live show.

58
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:18,280
We're choosing the order for the
live show and it'll be a 1:1 battle.

59
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,420
Today's a very important day where
you choose your opponent.

60
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:30,860
You have to choose from these 8 envelopes
and the one you pick is your opponent.

61
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,040
Who'll go first?

62
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,130
I'll go.

63
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,430
[Almeng has nerves of steel
and goes first again!]

64
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,100
[Those watching and choosing
are both very nervous!]

65
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,770
Since you do a diverse performance,
from a viewer's standpoint...

66
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,230
It'll be great if you went
head on with the Shorties.

67
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,590
Who's the best performer on stage?
I want you to go against the Shorties.

68
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,790
This one?

69
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,230
[Who is Almeng's opponent?]

70
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,050
[Almeng chose the 3rd envelope]

71
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,580
Hae-yong, pick another one.

72
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,610
- Pick another one.
- Should I?

73
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:37,880
Do you want to?

74
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,670
- They're all the same...
- I'll go with that.

75
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,590
Here I go!

76
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,850
- Can't he change it now?
- Nope. It's too late.

77
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,340
Man, you should let him.

78
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,770
[A battle between pros

80

[They're stupefied]

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,830
I said to pick the 2nd one!

82
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,770
I said pick the 2nd one...

83
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,610
My eyes told him not to pick it
and I even shouted it out.

84
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,650
But he did it.

85
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,370
I have fear whether
I could beat them...

86
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,350
And sadness that I need to
compete against Hae-yong.

87
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,300
[Second is Sam Kim]

88
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,710

and Jang Hanna are left]

[Who did they boldly choose?]

96
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,810
- I'm having indigestion.
- Are you really?

97
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,940
Really? Is it because this is
going to be you or not?

98
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,820
It shouldn't be you?

99
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,630
[Best friends and same age
The Shorties vs Jang Hanna]

100
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,130
For real?

101
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:09,290
The Shorties are really good.
I didn't want to battle them.

102
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,450
I'm burdened since this is 1:1.

103
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,210
[A battle between soul singers
Bae Mina vs Bernard Park]

104
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,200

- Why?

105
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,210
- He's really good.
- Because he's good?

106
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,420
[Even he's at a loss...]

107
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,330
I can't believe this!

108
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:29,070
At least you got 3rd place.
I was a candidate for elimination.

109

outcome of these battles]

As you have just watched, they
chose their opponents in advance.

The 4 victors from the 4 battles will
advance to the TOP6 live show next week.

117
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,490
The 4 that lost will become
candidates for elimination.

118
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:19,230
Real-time voting by the viewers and the judges'
decision will determine who is eliminated.

119
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,790
It's going to be a 1:1 battle and
I'll repeat the order once more.

120
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,230
The first battle is...

121
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:34,370
No. 1 Heejun Han goes beyond
his limits in every performance.

122
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,220

full of character and skilled.

voice that sways women's hearts.

134
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,310
It's going to be a close match
where the outcome is unpredictable.

135
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,230
It's hard to decide the outcome.
What do you, the viewers, think?

136
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,530
You can participate by
text voting in real time.

vote for more than one contestant.

But you cannot make multiple
votes for one contestant.

145

Since voting is possible via KakaoTalk,
those abroad can also participate.

We will now begin the TOP8 battles
for KPOP STAR Season 3.

147
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,400
The first battle is very intense.

148
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,700

[Heejun Han vs Almeng]

155
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,780
I personally wanted to avoid Almeng
when I heard it was a 1:1 battle.

156
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,460
I'm really close to Hae-yong,
a member of Almeng.

157
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,300
He's like a little brother.

158
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,480
He's very kind and
takes good care of us.

159
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,770
He's very playful.

[I'm sorry]

161
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:06,960
I felt a connection with him
the moment we started rooming.

162
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,340
It's ironic but I'm fortunate
to go against Almeng.

163
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,020
I'll battle fair and square
with my favorite team.

164
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,750
There's nothing for me to lose
whether I win or lose.

165
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,340

a great performance.

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,550

171
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,820
I don't know how he'll sing this
because most of it is in falsetto.

172
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,420
I don't know if he'll sing in
falsetto or in his voice.

173
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,120
It's unpredictable.

174
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,700
I wanted to express a man's cry
who is deep in sorrow.

175
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,560
There's going to be
a grand orchestra.

176
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,960
I had this desire to make
something like a musical.

177
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,870
This is going to be a challenge
but what about 8 beats like rock?

178
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:43,790
I won't hold back and will show
everything I have on stage.

He should have been nervous for

Another round of applause
for Heejun Han please.

185
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,300
He sang JYP's song
in his own color.

Let's hear the commentaries.

I'll go first.

188
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:42,160
I found out this song can be dramatic
after watching your performance.

189
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,780
The arrangement went beyond
what this song originally has.

190
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:58,720
This live stage expressed the sadness
in the song most dramatically.

191
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:09,270
It was very good that I wanted to
recommend JYP to use it in his concert.

192
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:13,320
I always say this but
you are smart.

193
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:24,240
You know how to create such a stage and
convey your voice, maybe it's experience.

194
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,550
You need that in music because
you are creating your own story.

195
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:32,720
I truly enjoyed it.
Good job.

196
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,220
I was actually worried
when you chose this song.

197
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,470
What if he dances as
he sings like JYP?

198
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,720
I hate this "house"

199
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,940
It was an appropriate amount. He just
danced where it was needed most.

200
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:09,790
I don't know why but many contestants
on KPOP STAR sing JYP's songs.

201
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:15,470
But it's always better than
JYP's performance.

202
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,360
It's easy to be better.

203
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:27,960
I expected several things that
he would do with this song.

204
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,960
But his performance was very fresh
because it wasn't how I expected it.

205
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:40,770
He looked the most relaxed out of
all his performances. Good job.

206
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,480
I agree with what they said.

207
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,380
You looked relaxed and the
performance was awesome.

208
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,300
But the unfortunate thing
was your voice.

209

It felt like you were
singing with a deep voice.

210
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:11,500
I like it when you sing comfortably
as if you are speaking.

211
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:17,550
But you sang throughout
in a deep voice.

212
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,300
So I wasn't able to hear
your voice that I like.

213
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:26,870
It's a pity that you didn't sing
comfortably as if you were speaking.

If you do advance, sing
as if you are speaking.

I look forward to how
they'll arrange this.

Heejun Han had a twist
in his song choice.

304
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,430
Almeng had a twist by getting rid of
the prejudice against singers.

I choose Almeng for having
a comprehensive twist.

309
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:09,050
Since both had their pros and cons,
I would like to give them the same score.

310

higher chance in having a twist next time.

313

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,470
I thought he was in college
but he was younger than me.

331
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,370
That's when I thought someone
that young can play like that.

332
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:21,630
I think this will be the most
dangerous round for Sam because...

333
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,450
Kwon Jina's rise is amazing.

334
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,100
But there's a variable.

335
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,140
We don't know how Sam will
change since he's young.

336
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,700
[What song did Sam Kim choose that
went beyond everyone's expectation?]

337
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,330
[Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean"]

338
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,000
[Moonwalk and spin dance became well-known
in this masterpiece by the "King of Pop"]

339
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,630
This song can be sung with
feel and not vocal skills.

340
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,300
So it gives Sam the highest
possible chance to win.

341
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,300
I never heard "Billie Jean"
sung to a guitar.

342
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,760
I'll get that chance now...

343
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,180
To hear "Billie Jean"
played by a 16-year-old.

344
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:13,240
[How would "Billie Jean"
sound on a guitar?]

345
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,220
You'll be singing before
thousands of people.

346
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,270
Thousands?

347
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,280
Where are they from?
Why is there so many?

348
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:31,420
I'm really nervous and
I don't know if I can do well.

349
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,520
[No. 3 Sam Kim]

350
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,470
This was his rendition with
excellent grooving on the guitar.

351
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,100
This stage was by
No. 3 Sam Kim!

352
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,650
Let's hear the commentaries.

353
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:30,900
The guitar playing during
the interlude was shocking.

354
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:47,120
Putting the notes aside, he was
playing along such amazing beats.

355
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:53,820
I have nothing more to say about your
musicality. I compliment you on that.

356
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,700
Now, only if your singing...

357
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,920
I'm not saying it's bad. If you
just learn the fundamentals...

358
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,890
If you learn breathing and singing,
you'll be a force to reckon with.

359
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:13,330
Your singing was a slight pity.

360
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,880
- You did well.
- Thank you.

361
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:32,880
Sam was like a soul musician
who's been playing for years.

362
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,100
He was also like a folk
or rock 'n' roll singer.

363
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:43,740
I can't believe a 16-year-old
can have such groove.

364
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,740
Just as JYP said, I don't know how to
play the guitar but I can hear it.

365
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:56,520
It's amazing he could play like that
on a live stage before many people.

366
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,710
I'm more curious how he'll be
in a year and not right now.

367
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:10,230
Just as JYP said, if you get the singing down,
you'll be world best and not only in Korea.

368
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:11,670
Good job.

369
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:20,240
All my prejudice were broken down
as I became a judge for KPOP STAR.

370
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,120
I rarely watched auditions and thought
everyone would be at a certain level.

371
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:33,610
My thoughts for this season is that
young people today are so good.

372
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:38,220
I'm amazed every time at
how good they are.

373
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:44,500
Today's K-pop is
mostly computerized.

374
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,500
Even GD, for example, even though he's
Korea's top producer and performer.

375
00:45:49,500 --> 00:46:01,700
I firmly believe that you'll develop a
new genre in K-pop with your guitar.

376
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,910
- Good job.
- Thank you.

377

emerged as a likely winner!]

Kwon Jina's rise is amazing.

382
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,000
Kwon Jina is in her prime.

383
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,400
There are no holes in
her fundamentals.

384

[She's rapidly rising and the
first to advance to the TOP8!]

385

I'm happy because I didn't
expect this at all but...

386
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,490
I'm worried whether I can do
better than the previous round.

[TOP8's practice room]

388
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:05,380

Sam is doing very well...

- Just a little more...
- How about the middle?

00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,730
You want a beating?

395
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:32,210
He showed others but
he didn't show me.

396
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,850
- Did you show him yours?
- Nope. Never.

stands out in this song]

400
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:49,550
I've seen clips of
Kwon Jina singing.

401
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:55,410
She arranges the song well that
we forget the original singer.

402
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:59,390
I look forward to how
she'll change my song.

403
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,220
Is she singing barefoot?

404
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,420
The choreography is
important in this song.

405
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:10,130
I wonder if she can give the same
inspiration with just her guitar.

406
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:11,940
I look forward to it.

407
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,240

make it this far.

408

[No. 4 Kwon Jina]

411
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:46,240
[24 Hours - Sunmi]

412
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,010
This stage was by No. 4 Kwon Jina who
changed a dance song to an acoustic.

413
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,060
What commentaries did the
judges make? Let's hear it.

414
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:05,760
I don't know if I can say this but
I think Kwon Jina is crazy.

415
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:16,750
Kwon Jina is currently the only one
who can change her tone skillfully.

416
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:24,380
She changed the tone and sang the
high notes in her voice and in falsetto.

417
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,820
All the notes in the ad-lib
at the end were perfect.

418
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:35,450
Even her sense of rhythm when
she played the dotted 24th note...

419
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:41,260
She played the shuffle exactly
like a professional musician.

420
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:45,160
The shocking thing, as a composer...

421
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,570
The third chord she played
was a minor sixth.

422
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:53,660
But she changed it to a major.
Her sense of arrangement is...

423
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:59,160
Musicality, guitar playing, sense of rhythm,
vocalization, musical interpretation...

424
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,080
It was a perfect performance.

425
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:06,000
If I were to score you, I would have
given you the highest score possible.

426
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,650
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

427
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:16,840
I laugh when JYP talks about sixth or
seventh (in Korean it ends with "do")...

428
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,800
I know Jeolla-do and
Gyeongsang-do but...

429
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,100
This battle was between
Sam Kim and Kwon Jina.

430
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,800
If a comparison is made...

431
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:42,710
Sam Kim has a fancy groove while
Kwon Jina has a stable groove.

432
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:47,470
Since Sam Kim's groove is fancy,
I have to pay attention or I'll miss it.

433
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,050
What is he going to do next?

434
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,820
I don't need to do that for Kwon Jina
because it just comes to me.

435
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,610
I feel comfortable
so I hate her.

436
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:05,490
If she lacks in something, I can point
that out and do my thing as a judge.

437
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:11,610
But it was a stable performance
without lackings. Good job.

438
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,310
- You're really good.
- Thank you.

439
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:33,340
I trained both Sam Kim
and Kwon Jina.

440
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,980
I was really nervous when
she chose this song.

441
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,440
I thought she made the wrong
choice, but lo and behold.

442
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:49,930
It's ridiculous that I worry
about her when she's this good.

443
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,900
Putting musicality, guitar
playing and everything aside...

444
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:02,300
According to my preference, she's the
best vocalist among the contestants here.

445
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:07,970
You feel like listening to her.

446
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:10,170
- Good job.
- Thank you.

447
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,310
I have a question.

448
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:17,790
Did you change the chord or was it
a suggestion by the musicians?

449
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,640
I did it.

450
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:32,500

The second battle was between

00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:48,390
It was a battle between

was better. It's Kwon Jina.

It's Kwon Jina again.

465
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:35,560
It's a pity for Sam because he lost
even though he did his best.

466
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,460
I also choose Kwon Jina.

00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:59,090
I practiced to become the main person
of this song and lose myself.

494
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:03,580
I think it's a good choice.

495
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:14,140
I think she can come out saying
"I'm Jang Hanna" with this song.

496
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:20,730
I do well during practice but
get nervous up on the stage.

497
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:25,090
I'm worried that I have
stage fright.

498
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,900
I read the lyrics and practiced
putting in emotion while singing.

499
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:36,190
I did a lot of image training so
that I'm ready to sing whenever.

500
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:42,580
I'll be confident and show
that I can enjoy this time.

501
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,390
I want to make it
to the TOP6.

502
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,680
[No. 5 Jang Hanna]

503
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:11,540
This stage was by No. 5 Jang Hanna
with a soulful voice and sentiment.

504
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,770
Let's hear the commentaries.

505
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:30,950
We three judges always talk about
you when the recording is over.

506
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:35,810
If she could only properly use
that million dollar voice.

507
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:40,270
She could unleash it if she adds
only passion and emotion into it.

508
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:44,650
You do have a million dollar voice.
All you need is to open your mouth.

509
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:47,310
It always wasn't enough but...

510
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:52,030
Out of all your performances,
this one hit the spot.

511
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,220
But...

512
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,180
It's still a pity.

513
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:03,720
You're still in your right mind.
How do we know that?

514
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:16,440
I want you to be excited and your gestures
to be out of control somewhere in the song.

515
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,750
You improved a lot and
showed your potential but...

516
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:26,280
We can tell if you're in your right mind
or not by looking at your gestures.

517
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,430
But you made remarkable progress.

518
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:29,990
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

519
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:40,220
You felt it was a pity and even cried
that you can't unleash your potential.

520
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:47,130
Stick a flower in your head next time
to show JYP that you lost yourself.

521
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,500
I was joking.

522
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:54,660
I think today was your
best performance ever.

523
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:55,900
Thank you.

524
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:04,280
You have a great voice and timbre
that we judges talk about.

525
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:09,930
I think this was a song where
you could show all of that.

526
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:19,650
I believe you'll become uncontrollable
once you're on an upward swing.

527
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,610
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

528
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,910
I agree more with JYP.

529
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:34,480
The expression that you should
look like you're not there...

530
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:41,780
You shouldn't be there when you
are singing but somewhere else.

531
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:45,370
You have to fall into the
meaning of the lyrics...

532
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:48,170
Then the gestures become natural.

533
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:54,940
The subtle movement of the eyebrows,
breathing and such allow you to empathize.

534
01:05:54,940 --> 01:06:00,640
Yes, you did sing the best
out of all the songs you chose.

535
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:08,400
It's a pity that you didn't have
the power to pull us in.

536
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:13,900
I want to see your performance where
I get pulled in as soon as possible.

537
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,590
But you did well.
Good job.

[I. The Shorties Begins]

542
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,780
Our teacher called us shorties
when we walked side by side.

543
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,260
You three are really short.
You really are shorties.

544
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,210
We accepted it the moment
we heard it. It's inevitable.

545
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:03,180
[That's how the Shorties were born!]

01:07:15,930 --> 01:07:19,010
Good night. Bye.

551
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:21,060
They can't go to sleep
now because of us.

552
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:22,240
Sorry.

553
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:28,010
Song choice is the most
important for this team.

554
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,020
Wow...

555
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:35,560
Really?

556
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,680
For real?

557
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,770
I didn't expect this.

558
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:46,830
I thought someone would
sing this song but...

559
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:51,870
The Shorties are singing
"Let It Go."

560
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:56,730
[Including Hyolyn of SISTAR!]

561
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:01,260
[Many singers went wild
over this song!]

562
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:07,220
I never heard an a cappella or
harmony version of "Let It Go."

563
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:11,250
Many female solo artists sang this
to show off their singing skills.

564
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:17,050
But I think the Shorties'
version will be very good.

565
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:20,210
[A certain day before the battle]

566
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,410
What do we wear?

567
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,460
- Frozen's...
- Elsa's dress?

568
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,340
You have to wear it since
you're in the middle.

[They search Elsa's dress!]

570

We picked a dress that make
us look like a goddess...

571
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,860
- I said not to use that word.
- Alright, alright.

572
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:44,320
Say that it's soft and light.

573
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,260
- Don't have such a mind.
- That word is dangerous.

574
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,170
[It sure is soft and light]

You just heard a harmony
version of "Let It Go."

What did the judges think of
No. 6 The Shorties' stage?

581
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:47,780
Let's hear the commentaries.

582
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:00,510
This wasn't an easy choice and
I believe you knew that.

583
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:08,050
Many female artists sing this song
to show, "Hey, I'm a great singer."

584
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:12,180
You chose a song with a
high level of difficulty.

585
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:16,780
None of the contestants here, except
for you, could sing this song.

586
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:28,840
Due to the high level of difficulty,
I felt uneasy at certain parts.

587
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,750
But that's not important.

588
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,620
What's important is how well you
sang the parts you sing well.

589
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:44,240
When you sang the climax, it was
as beautiful as Yuna Kim's jump.

590
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:48,050
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

591
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,120
It was better than your
previous two performances.

592
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:02,510
You sang much better.

593
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:11,540
Our hearts are open due to your
efforts and the thought you put in.

594
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:16,750
After I told Na-jin to breathe
from her belly and not chest...

595
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:23,840
She never breathed from her
chest. That's what's amazing.

596
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:33,180
But why am I not KO'd despite
the fact that you sing well?

597
01:14:33,180 --> 01:14:39,890
There are many great singers
all over the world.

598
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:45,730
What happened to your way of speaking?
The Shorties' way of speaking...

599
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:52,360
I think that's what's
keeping me together.

600
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:58,900
Be like the new generation you are.
There are already many great singers...

601
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:04,180
You have your generation's way of speaking,
pronunciation, and expression different from them.

602
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,680
I hope you bring that.

603
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:12,940
As your singing improves,
my heart doesn't flutter as much.

604
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:15,540
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

605
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:29,780
I think I heard "Let It Go"
the most among the 3 judges.

606
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:32,330
My daughter...

607
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:35,590
Now that there's VOD service...

608
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:41,720
She wears the same princess dress
and dances along it day and night.

609
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:48,690
I hear it in the restroom and when
I go to bed. I'm sick of it now.

610
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:56,770
"Let It Go" played a big role in
making the movie a success.

611
01:15:56,770 --> 01:16:00,200
So I had high hopes
for the Shorties.

612
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:06,690
I thought, "How much will they move
me with their singing abilities?"

613
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:13,940
Your harmony wasn't as beautiful as
I wanted due to the size of this place.

614
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:24,510
JYP's commentary would have been better if
you sang your very own touching harmony.

615
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:30,320
It was a pity because
I had high expectations.

616
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,410
- Good job.
- Thank you.

617
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:40,270

Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

619
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,100
This stage was by
No. 6 The Shorties!

620
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:54,000
Isn't this cruel? This was a battle
between friends of the same age.

621
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:01,850
This is like an Elsa Beauty Pageant with
four Elsas here. They're very beautiful.

622
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:06,610
This was a cruel match...

623
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:12,350
But one team will advance and the other
will be a candidate for elimination.

624
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:14,410
Please announce the result.

625
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:23,760
Today's performance was their best
compared to their recent performances.

626
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:29,970
But both teams' color, emotion,
and individuality were a pity.

627
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:37,490
So I chose the one that
sang a little better.

628
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:41,060
I choose the Shorties
as the victor.

629
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:45,300
JYP chose the Shorties.

630
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,780
You Hee-yeol?

631
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:52,090
They're all basically good
if they're in the TOP8.

632
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:56,060
The difference is who was
less or more nervous.

633
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,640
The victor chosen by
Antenna Music is...

634
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,810
Jang Hanna.

635
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,930
It's Jang Hanna!
Currently, it's a tie.

636
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:10,210
YG's decision will now determine
who advances to the live show.

637
01:18:10,210 --> 01:18:11,560
What is YG's choice?

638
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:18,250
To be honest, this is really hard.

639
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:24,740
I gave much thought and finally
made a decision right now.

640
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,670
I gave 51 points to the team whose
performance I want to see next time.

641
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:38,040
The victor I chose is...

642
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,040
The Shorties.

643
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:43,460
It's the Shorties! They advance
to next week's TOP6 live show!

644
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:46,440
Jang Hanna is a candidate
for elimination.

645
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:56,190
Those cheering for Jang Hanna
can still vote by texting to #0606.

646
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:02,220
They're congratulating and
cheering up each other.

647
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:06,200
Let's now begin the last battle.

648
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:11,450
The fourth battle is between
Bae Mina and Bernard Park.

649
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:16,880
[Bernard Park]

650
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,890
[Bae Mina]

651
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:22,430
[Bae Mina vs Bernard Park]

652
01:19:23,190 --> 01:19:28,830
I said that Bernard Park was a
heavyweight compared to boxing.

653
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:33,160
Then that would make
Bae Mina a lightweight.

654
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:41,570
I think this battle would put
her at a disadvantage.

655
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:47,570
Mina has to put on her
best performance ever.

656
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:50,230
[Her worst crisis ever!
How is she feeling?]

657
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,610
[Sigh]

658
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:59,170
I thought, "What do I do?
I'm going to be eliminated."

659
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:04,080
I think this will be my last.

660
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,730
[What song will she sing
thinking this is her last?]

661
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,220
[Mariah Carey's "Whenever You Call"]

662
01:20:10,220 --> 01:20:13,040
[Subtle R&B sentiments and
ad-libs stand out in this song]

663
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:20,470
If I can sing the beginning in detail
and the high notes well later on...

664
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:26,260
I think it'll be a good performance
and that's why I chose this song.

665
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:29,240
She'll sing this well.

666
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:33,530
Her attempt is close to
being a miracle.

667
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:36,480
But she does have a chance.

668
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:42,060
I received many compliments
from the beginning.

669
01:20:46,910 --> 01:20:51,470
But it seems that Bae Mina
is improving every time.

670
01:20:51,470 --> 01:20:53,710
I don't know what
will happen.

671
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:00,220
[She's really worried but
she has a big support]

672
01:21:00,220 --> 01:21:07,460
My dad always told me to focus
on my studies and not singing.

673
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:14,400
He came for the first time during
the TOP10 performance.

674
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:18,260
I think he changed his mind.

675
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:23,240
He called me saying that my
studies are important but...

676
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:30,030
Since I made it this far,
I should focus on singing.

677
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:41,420
I was happy. I felt I was being
recognized and he was proud.

678
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:50,440
I want to go up on stage
and make my family proud.

679
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,830
[No. 7 Bae Mina]

680
01:24:43,710 --> 01:24:44,990
Thank you.

681
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:51,280
This stage was by No. 7 Bae Mina
who sang with a unique timbre.

682
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,580
Let's hear the commentaries.

683
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,380
This was your best so far.

684
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:09,570
But...

685
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:14,360
People don't sing well because
they are great singers.

686
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,440
There is a way of singing
being led by one's emotions.

687
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,620
Even though the same high notes
were sung exceptionally well...

688
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:25,300
A song that is sung by thinking,
"I need to sing well" and...

689
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:30,980
A song that is led when one's
emotions run high are different.

690
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:34,520
Since you're still young...
you're only 16 right now.

691
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,930
You sing as if you're studying.

692
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:41,590
"I should sing this like this."
What I want to see next time...

693
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:45,370
Let your emotions lead the song.

694
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:53,710
Some contestants sang poorly but got
high scores because of their emotions.

695
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:56,850
I hope you can think about it.

696
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,640
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

697
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,940
You were pitted in an
unfavorable pool.

698
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:13,510
As you said in the clip
before coming on stage...

699
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:18,190
You said you'll sing as if
this was your last.

700
01:26:18,190 --> 01:26:23,560
Instead of listening to you sing,
I felt sad after hearing that.

701
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,540
It felt like you were
telling the truth.

702
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:42,710
You're the youngest from the TOP8
and even shorter than the Shorties.

703
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:46,410
I sympathize with you.

704
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:49,260
I'm already sad that you
might be eliminated.

705
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:55,080
I compliment you highly
on doing your best.

706
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,010
- Good job.
- Thank you.

707
01:27:00,870 --> 01:27:03,280
I'm not sad.

708
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,200
I'm happy because
she did well.

709
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:07,180
Thank you.

710
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:17,090
If you do become a singer later on,
you think the others sing well, right?

711
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:20,710
But there's something
only you are good at.

712
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:29,000
You're the best in singing the high notes
of an R&B song in a pretty way.

713
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,820
Don't be envious and try to
be good at everything.

714
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:36,450
Even singers might or might not
get a good song in their lifetime.

715
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:40,140
They can be loved or not
by that one hit song.

716
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:44,810
Trust in yourself because
you have the talent.

717
01:27:44,810 --> 01:27:47,700
- Just do music.
- Thank you.

718
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:49,720
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

719

text "7" or "Bae Mina" to #0606.

Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

721
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:02,940
This stage was by
No. 7 Bae Mina!

722
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:11,380
[Bernard was always complimented but
barely made it from being eliminated]

723
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:22,420
Of course, I'm thankful.

724
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,530
[What is Bernard singing?]

725
01:28:32,530 --> 01:28:37,630
I'm singing Michael Buble's "Home."

726
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:41,730
[The song is about longing for
home after a long journey]

727
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:48,890
[When he first arrived in
Korea last October]

728
01:28:51,480 --> 01:29:03,600
[His childhood in the States]

729
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,490
[The other contestants meet their
family after every round is over]

730
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:30,880
[To his parents who weren't
able to come to Korea]

731
01:30:07,410 --> 01:30:10,820
[No. 8 Bernard Park]

732
01:33:55,200 --> 01:34:00,910
This last stage was by No.8 Bernard Park
whose voice melts women's hearts.

733
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,300
Let's hear the commentaries.

734
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:07,600
I don't think you saw
that behind you.

735
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:13,330
It was a clip of you
when you left home.

736
01:34:13,330 --> 01:34:16,300
I almost cried again.

737
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:22,840
I see that you're back.

738
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,160
Thank you.

739
01:34:26,970 --> 01:34:33,990
I was worried because you
looked gloomy and depressed.

740
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:38,230
But I think you found it
with this song.

741
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:39,810
It was the best!

742
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:41,010
Thank you.

743
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:46,290
Putting aside whether
you sang well or not...

744
01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:50,790
I felt sad. I don't even know
the lyrics of this song.

745
01:34:50,790 --> 01:34:54,500
But I felt sad.
I want to go home.

746
01:34:57,130 --> 01:34:59,220
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

747
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:13,980
We three judges gave you a very bad
commentary in the past two rounds.

748
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:17,630
Your singing was dead
and it didn't move us.

749
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:19,200
I thought about it.

750
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:24,030
You can't even speak
properly in Korean.

751
01:35:24,030 --> 01:35:28,830
We're comfortable in Korean but
you're comfortable in English.

752
01:35:28,830 --> 01:35:32,310
It's impossible for you to get
the emotion in Korean.

753
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:37,260
So your singing was dead but
when you sang in English...

754
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:42,780
My body froze when you sang
you wanted to go home.

755
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:51,440
As I said earlier, your emotions
were leading the song today.

756
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:53,150
It was truly...

757
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:55,110
The best performance.

758
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:56,410
Thank you.

759
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:06,310
You sang gayo in the
last two performances.

760
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:09,720
What JYP said is correct.

761
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:13,790
I wouldn't give the same feeling
if I sang in English. It's the same.

762
01:36:15,490 --> 01:36:22,710
When I heard you're singing "Home,"
just as I worried about Bae Mina...

763
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:28,190
I was thinking, "Take it easy."

764
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:33,530
It was the best out of all
your performances.

765
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,730
You stole my heart the most
with today's performance.

766
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,460
It was a great performance.
And for your next one...

767
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:49,490
Don't sing gayo because you
can't even speak Korean well.

768
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:53,780
Sing what you're good at.
Then it'll be competitive.

769
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:55,680
It was a great performance.

770
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:04,870
Those cheering for Bernard Park can
text "8" or "Bernard Park" to #0606.

771
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:07,530
Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

772
01:37:07,530 --> 01:37:09,920
This stage was by
No. 8 Bernard Park!

773
01:37:14,130 --> 01:37:21,600
The final battle of this live show was
between Bae Mina and Bernard Park.

774
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:29,640
These two possess R&B sentiments.
I wonder what the outcome will be.

775
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,090
Let's hear what the result is.
Please make the announcement.

776
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:37,930
You Hee-yeol said that
Bernard is back but...

777
01:37:37,930 --> 01:37:40,470
I'm back. Beraholic is back.

778
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:44,190
I choose Bernard Park
as the victor.

779
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:49,610
It's Bernard Park! Congratulations!
Bernard got one vote. You Hee-yeol?

780
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:54,640
Antenna Music chooses
Bernard Park as the victor.

781
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,900
It's Bernard Park! YG?

782
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:08,000
Not only the three judges, but I think
even the viewers would think the same.

783
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,800
Today is Bernard Park's
complete victory.

784
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:12,720
Good job.

785
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:20,260
This makes Bernard the fourth to
advance to the TOP6 live show.

786
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:24,160
Bae Mina is not eliminated but
a candidate for elimination.

I'll announce just one person chosen
by the viewers to advance to TOP6.

823
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:36,220
I'll announce who among the four gets to
advance to next week's TOP6 live show.

824
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:42,000
I received an envelope but do not know
the result because I didn't open it.

825
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,350
I'll open it now.

826
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:51,150
I'll announce who among the four gets to
advance to next week's TOP6 live show.

827
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:19,180
The 5th TOP6 finalist determined by
the highest total of real-time votes is...

828
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:21,670
I'll announce it now!

829
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:26,430
Among the four...

830
01:43:26,430 --> 01:43:29,100
1st goes to...

831
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,480
Sam Kim!

832
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:39,890
Sam Kim received the most votes.

833
01:43:39,890 --> 01:43:43,890
Please move over there
with the other finalists.

834
01:43:48,380 --> 01:43:56,760
Alright. Sam Kim is the 5th to receive
the honor of advancing to the TOP6.

835
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:04,590
Among the remaining three, only one
can advance to the TOP6 live show.

836
01:44:04,590 --> 01:44:11,470
And the remaining two will
depart from KPOP STAR.

837
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:13,550
Alright.

838
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:22,520
Heejun Han, Jang Hanna, and Bae Mina
are waiting for the judges' decision.

839
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:29,080
Sam Kim is in the winners seat
due to the viewers' votes.

840
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:38,550
Only one from the remaining three
will go to next week's TOP6 live show.

841
01:44:38,550 --> 01:44:41,970
Today will be the last
for the remaining two.

842
01:44:41,970 --> 01:44:45,210
What decision did
the judges make?

843
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:51,290
Please announce the result
if you are done discussing.

844
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:00,940
Even the viewers will have conflicting
opinions since no one thinks alike.

845
01:45:10,210 --> 01:45:14,840
I felt pity for Bae Mina
and said she'll go far.

846
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:19,980
I had my eyes on Jang Hanna
during this season.

847
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,960
And Heejun Han had
many complications.

848
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:33,440
I think only the strong
can survive now.

849
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:41,040
Since the next round is
going to be more intense.

850
01:45:43,050 --> 01:45:59,050
The last TOP6 finalist
chosen by the judges is...

851
01:45:59,050 --> 01:46:00,840
Heejun Han.

852
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:05,420
Heejun Han is the last finalist!

853
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:14,760
Jang Hanna and Bae Mina are leaving
KPOP STAR with today's performance.

854
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,080
They went through a lot.

855
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:25,730
Please come and cheer them up.
They really did go through a lot.

856
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:33,670
Congratulations to Heejun Han
once again for advancing.

857
01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:44,770
The judges have mixed feelings but
say a word for Bae Mina and Jang Hanna.

858
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:52,520
We are not that disappointed
even though you are leaving.

859
01:46:52,520 --> 01:47:02,000
Just as we said in the commentaries,
both gave your best performance.

860
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,820
That gives us hope.

861
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:10,950
We know you gave your best.
Both of you did very well.

862
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:12,480
Thank you.

863
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:20,860
Since YG and You Hee-yeol aren't ready,
do you have anything to say, Bae Mina?

864
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:30,250
I didn't know I would make it this far.
I made great memories and experiences.

865
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:41,070
I thank my parents, the three judges,
the KPOP STAR staff, and the emcee.

866
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:45,580
I'll do better. Thank you.

867
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,570
Thank you, Bae Mina.

868
01:47:47,570 --> 01:47:49,310
And Jang Hanna?

869
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:54,550
First, I thank you for giving
me this great opportunity.

870
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:59,920
I thank the three judges,
my parents, and friends.

871
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,550
I'll also do better.
Thank you.

872
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,630
Jang Hanna and Bae Mina are
unfortunately eliminated.

873
01:48:10,630 --> 01:48:15,960
We'll see you again next week
at the TOP6 live show.

874
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:21,530
Starting with the TOP6 live show,
for the first time on KPOP STAR...

875
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:26,430
We'll have YG week, JYP week, and
Antenna week spread over 3 weeks.

876
01:48:26,430 --> 01:48:29,660
It will be the 3 agencies week.

877
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:32,960
Look forward to the
performances next week.

878
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:37,110
This was KPOP STAR Season 3, a real
audition where dreams turn into reality.

879
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:38,210
See you next week!

880
01:48:38,210 --> 01:49:01,734

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,000

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,110
[His potential is limitless!]

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,850
Our first TOP3 is Sam Kim!

16
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,130
He is rapidly rising and gives an
amazing performance each round!

17
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,270
[Kwon Jina turns into a
goddess from a girl!]

18
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,110
[A female vocalist with
a new sentiment!]

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,910
[Musicality, guitar playing, sense of rhythm,
vocalization, and musical interpretation]

20
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,410
[Kwon Jina in crazy mode!]

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,900
[She could become the best
female ballad singer!]

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,860
[She is skilled in her
varied voices!]

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,200
[That is frightening!]

24
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,930
Our second TOP3 is Kwon Jina!

25
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,110
She is loved immensely for her
captivating timbre and voice!

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,730
[Bernard Park has a voice
that touches the heart!]

27
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,740
[Set a record with
a score of 299!]

28
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,610
[His voice is a masterpiece!]

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,110
[Lavished with praise
by the judges!]

Another round of applause for the
TOP3 that made to the seminfinal!

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,230
Hello to the viewers
watching this live.

37
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm Jun Hyun-moo, the emcee
for KPOP STAR Season 3.

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,500
We now have one round left for
the K-pop star to be decided.

39
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:46,690
The outcome is unpredictable and one
of them will be the 3rd K-pop star.

40
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,920
Please tune in to the end.

41
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,950
The winner will be awarded a cash prize of
$300,000 and a midsize diesel vehicle.

42
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,230
The runner-up will get
a compact diesel vehicle.

43
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,390
I introduce the three judges that are
more nervous as we reach the finale.

44
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,630
JYPE's Park Jin-young!

45
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,060
YGE's Yang Hyun-suk!

46
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,050
Antenna Music's You Hee-yeol!

47
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,710
Every live show was hard...

48
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,760
But it's hard to predict who
will be eliminated today.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,000
YG, how do you predict
today's performance?

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,230
I think this round is more important
and tense than the finale.

51
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,020
The strange thing is...

52
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:50,860
JYP complimented Bernard Park from
the beginning and said he's a Beraholic.

53
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,980
I wasn't able to but You Hee-yeol
recognized Kwon Jina at first sight.

54
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,960
I don't know if you remember but...

55
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,840
I predicted Sam Kim to be in TOP3
after watching his first performance.

56
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,000
It's interesting that the person
we're each rooting for are here.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,780
It feels more like a battle between
the 3 agencies and not amongst them.

58
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,730
Do your best and we won't be
cutting you slack in this round.

59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,360
Whether you did well or not
in the past isn't important.

60
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,720
We'll judge solely on how you
do today so do your best.

61
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,010
This will also be a standpoint on
whose prediction is correct.

62
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:44,160
JYP, you said the winner you're thinking of
changes every week. Is that actually true?

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,970
I'm not saying this because we're on
broadcast but I honestly don't know.

64
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,780
But as we saw until now...

65
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,980
Bernard Park has the voice...

66
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Kwon Jina has the technique...

67
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,560
And Sam Kim has the feel.

68
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,470
That's a close match.

69
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,110
Who will use their skills to
the fullest? That is the key.

70
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,170
This is a battle between
voice, technique, and feel.

71
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,900
You Hee-yeol, this past week
was Antenna Music week.

72
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,920
JYP and YG had a strong week.
Were you able to inspire them?

73
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:28,610
We did our best but I don't
know what they thought.

74
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:33,810
They're already like fellow
singers and juniors to me.

75
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,470
I look forward to the best performance
but there is one thing I can't get over.

76
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,240
JYP's shirt is cut
fairly low at the neck.

77
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,540
I thought it was stretched.

78
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,310
I can see his collarbone and
I am very uncomfortable.

79
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,240
Well, he is fashion forward.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
But we do see some skin.

81
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:04,170
Let's watch how You Hee-yeol
inspired them as a musician.

82
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,770
[It's Antenna Music week!]

83
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,780
[For this week...]

84
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,600
[They're visiting the office
of Antenna Music!]

85
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,540
The other two are
Korea's best agencies...

86
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,910
But we are more like a family and
I wanted to make them feel that.

87
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,410
It's been a year since every artist
under our label gathered.

88
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,880
Thanks to them, we're having something
like a welcome party for freshmen.

89
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,820
We prepared a little get-together.

90
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,290
[How did they prepare the
welcome party for the TOP3?]

91
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,560
[Party balloons]

92
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,040
[Refreshments]

93
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,620
[Welcome banner]

94
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,650
[And...]

95
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,650
[A surprise welcome party!]

96
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,080
Suddenly I'm shy.

97
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,670
[Jung Jaehyung, 45, 20-year veteran
the oldest in Antenna Music]

98
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,650
[Lucid Fall, 40, 14-year veteran
coo and gurgle singing style]

99
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,570
You're nervous because there
are a lot of cameras, right?

100
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,040
[The biggest event since the agency
was founded! They're all nervous...]

101
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,580
[Peppertones, 11-year veteran
Antenna Music's idol group]

102
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,310
[Park Sae Byul, 30, 7-year veteran
the youngest in Antenna Music]

103
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,020
I'm so nervous! Wait...

104
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,500
- How do we use this?
- Smile naturally.

105
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,090
[Unnatural...]

106
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,270
Make a comfortable smile.

107
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,100
I'm nervous because
I can't do that.

108
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm feeling nauseous.

109
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,330
[Can they do this properly?]

110
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,690
[Outside the door...]

111
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,990
[You Hee-yeol waits nervously]

112
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,690
Why are you looking at
pictures of women?

113
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,540
Don't surf the web.
Do something like excel!

114
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,360
[He nags at them because
he's feeling nervous...]

115
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,470
Don't you have different slippers?

116
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,810
[While he's waiting nervously...]

117
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,900
[They arrived!]

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,980
[They don't know a surprise
welcome party is prepared]

119
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,410
[They go inside for now...]

120
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,250
- Quiet, they're coming.
- He startled me.

121
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,830
I'm nervous...

122
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,840
[Sigh...]

123
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,290
Stay close then
we'll tremble less.

124
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,000
[They enter the office]

125
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,720
[He greets them calmly
with a smile]

126
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,580
- I think they're here!
- They're here.

127
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,750
[Frozen]

128
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,720
He's our CEO.

129
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,540
[It's peaceful out here...]

130
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,080
[But they're nervous inside!]

131
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,180
[What do we say?]

132
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,550
[Welcome]

133
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,880
Alright! Let's go in!

134
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,750
[The time has come!]

135
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,430
[Welcome]

136
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,320
[Antenna Music's artists have
all gathered after a year]

137
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,460
[They were a bit clumsy
in the surprise]

138
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,020
[But the response was great!]

139
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,460
[A simple party prepared
by their seniors!]

140
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,590
This is embarrassing...

141
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,330
Sit over there for now.

142
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,390
We haven't been on
television that much.

143
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,350
Because of our age, we also
felt a little embarrassed.

144
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,870
We felt both excited and
awkward at the same time.

145
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,280
[The TOP3 welcome party
officially begins!]

146
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,150
[Sam Kim introduces first...]

147
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,400
Stand up.

148
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:15,030
Hi, my name is Sam Kim and
I'm the youngest here.

149
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,550
- How old are you?
- I'm 16...

150
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,070
What happened to you?

151
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,220
[I'm joking]

152
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,790
[Next is Kwon Jina]

153
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,750
Hi, my name is Kwon Jina.

154
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,680
Time for the talent show.

155
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,070
[The talent show is the
centerpiece of the party]

156
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:39,960
- Here you go...
- No, not that.

157
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,490
Since she's already
good with the guitar...

158
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,770
I heard that she's good
at the "Growl" dance.

159
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,370
[Her "Growl" dance
is now a legend!]

160
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,890
[It's an unusual scene since there is no
dancing singer in Antenna Music!]

161
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,680
[They're singing a dance song?]

162
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:07,530
[Can she do the "Growl" dance
along their singing?]

163
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,760
[Here she goes]

164
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,860
[The legendary growling
goddess is back!]

165

Bernard looks really...

168
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,040
[He can't avoid it]

169
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,190
He's like this and not smiling.

170
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,240
First time seeing him flustered.

171
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,250
[Bernard Park's turn]

172
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,290
Hi, my name is Bernard Park
and I'm 22 years old.

173
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,490
[As soon as he's done...]

174
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,260
Now it's your turn...

175
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,590
[What is he going to do?]

176
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,650
He's good at dancing
Beyonce's "Single Ladies."

177
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,160
[Really?]

178
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,340
[He's doing this dance?]

179
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,550
You will sing and dance for
the first time without music.

180
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,820
[Bernard's "Single Lady" dance
started with a tip-off from Sam!]

181
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,860
[It's a big hit]

182
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,160
[Bernard's was the best]

183
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,600
They have nowhere to go
but Antenna Music, right?

184
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,280
That's right.

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,600
Is there any other?

186
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,150
This show was planned
centered on Antenna Music.

187
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,720
There's a place called YG and
what was the other one?

188
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,050
It belongs to Jin-young but
I forgot what it was called.

189
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,320
I heard the JYP building
belongs to Cho Yong-pil.

190
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,830
[JYP = Cho Yong-pil?]

191
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:59,570
There's a place called JYP that
he's renting from Cho Yong-pil.

192
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:05,350
YG looks great, right? But most of
their income is from the cafeteria.

193
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,800
[They stop with the gag and
make a toast to their welcome!]

194
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,570
[Someone arrives in
front of the agency!]

195
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,030
[Who is this charismatic man?]

196
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,020
[Who is it?]

197
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,920
[It's Yoon Jong-shin!]

198
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,410
[You Hee-yeol invited
Yoon Jong-shin in secret!]

199
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,270
[They're dumbfounded]

200
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,510
- I'll introduce him...
- This is my branch.

201
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,690
[He's the CEO of an agency that has
musical ties with Antenna Music]

202
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm sorry. I can't see.

203
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,700
You wore that just for
your entrance?

204
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,910
I wanted to look tough.

205
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,210
I called him saying that
the three of you are coming.

206
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:16,070
He said he wanted to meet you,
and we often meet like this and talk.

207
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:21,580
Next week is the finale and
one of them will be eliminated.

208
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:29,630
There's a new rule where the winner
gets to choose his/her agency.

209
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,660
- On the spot?
- On the spot!

210
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,230
As a CEO, give them some advice
to make the right choice...

211
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,170
Putting CEO aside...

212
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,740
This is the only agency that
will do everything for you.

213
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,660
[Are they that desperate?]

214
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,360
[Seems like he hit the mark]

215
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,860
You won't get better treatment than 2NE1
even though you become the winner.

216
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,280
But here...

217
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,860
You will get treated well
even if you get 3rd place.

218
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,280
How did I do as a rookie judge?

219
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,880
To put it bluntly...

220
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,520
He wanted to take off
rather than be a judge.

221
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,900
I've never seen anyone do
commercials after being a judge.

222
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,960
He did it for himself and
not for Antenna Music.

223
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,330
[Everyone was all smiles
at the welcome party...]

224
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,090
People doing music nowadays...

225
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:42,230
Think it's competitive, there's
hard work and unrelenting pain.

226
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:47,050
But we have fun and are
happy doing music.

227
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:53,930
We grow and learn from one another
whether you're a senior or junior.

228
00:16:53,930 --> 00:17:01,010
I hope they can feel that
and have hope in that.

229
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:08,870
I want to give them a present that
they can live their life doing music.

230
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,610
This past week was Antenna Music week.
Were you satisfied, You Hee-yeol?

231
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,470
I feel embarrassed.

232
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,530
It's been a while seeing
balloons at a welcome party.

233
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,730
Our artists blew up all
those balloons.

234
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,360
It was more like a reception.

235
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,260
I'll explain today's rules.

236
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,680
It's absolute evaluation again...

237
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:51,880
The total score is calculated from
judges' score 60% and viewers' votes 40%.

238
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,210
Two with the highest total score will
advance to next week's finale.

239
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,230
And one will unfortunately
depart from KPOP STAR.

240
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,390
Please stay tuned to find out
who will advance to the finale.

241
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,420
I'll announce their order
and number.

242
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:20,400
No.1 Bernard Park now touches
everyone's heart, young and old.

243
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,710
No. 2 Kwon Jina is complimented every
round with unexpected performances.

244
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,160
No. 3 Sam Kim is a guitar genius
who knows how to enjoy the stage.

245
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:44,770
It's fine to call this the finale with
such likely winners competing.

246
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,490
Thus, your votes will be
very important today.

247
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,170
Yoo Hye-young will explain
how the voting is done.

248
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,900
- Yoo Hye-young?
- Yes, can you hear this?

249
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,770
The audience is buzzing with
excitement more than ever.

250
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,840
Hi, I'm Yoo Hye-young.

251
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,130
Your votes are important since
one of them will be eliminated.

252
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,740
I'll explain how you can vote.

253
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:20,770
Text the contestant's name in Korean or
their number to #0606 on your phone.

254
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,200
You might know this by now.

255
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,610
You can vote for more than one contestant
but no multiple votes for one contestant.

256
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,960
Since voting is possible via KakaoTalk,
those abroad can also participate.

257
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,010
The semifinal will soon begin.
Are you ready to vote?

258
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,900
Text voting begins now!

259
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,350
[Text voting begins]

260
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,640
[Text the contestant's name in Korean or
number to #0606 (10 cents data charge)]

261
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,310
This show is being televised live.
We ask that many of you vote.

262
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,570
Many special stages are prepared.

263
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:10,560
First is a collaboration between
Kwon Jina and JYP's Sunmi.

264
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:18,590
Second is Bernard Park and Antenna Music's
Peppertones and Park Sae Byul.

265
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,320
And finally Sam Kim meets them.

266
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,910
There's a collaboration
between 2NE1 and Sam Kim.

267
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:30,990
There's another special stage
after all of that is over.

268
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:40,650
Akdong Musician, winners of Season 2,
will be making their debut here after a year.

269
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:46,970
They're performing two songs for the
first time so please look forward to that.

270
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,900
We will now officially begin.

271
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,940
He received the highest
score ever at 299.

272
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,680
No. 1 Bernard Park is up!

273
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,410
[No. 1 Bernard Park]

274
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,430
[He received the highest score
ever last week at 299!]

275
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,110
I never knew I would get
that high of a score.

276
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,570
That feeling was indescribable.

277
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,850
[He meets his parents after
getting into the TOP3]

278
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,840
You really got me too when
you said "I love you" at the end.

279
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,700
I love you.

280
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,320
That gave me a boost.

281
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,350
I think I can do better.

282
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,920
[They were practicing for the
TOP3 performance one day]

283
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,370
[A very slim man visits them]

284
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,770
Let me try that.

285
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,220
[With one try!]

286
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,640
[He's weaker than
the female staff]

287
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,720
[Weak You Hee-yeol makes
them a surprise visit]

288
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:07,130
I wanted to give them a
pep talk and cheer them up.

289
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:12,820
I thought of what could
encourage them.

290
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,070
Inside this envelope...

291
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,590
I'll look at the concerns
you wrote down.

292
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,590
First...

293
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,480
Bernard wrote in English!

294
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,160
[He's taken aback]

295
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,680
[Paper is white, writing is blue...]

296
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,900
Should I read it for you?

297
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,680
[Thank you]

298
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,620
Would I have a successful
singing career in Korea?

299
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,410
People act differently...

300
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,440
- How can I...
- Apply that?

301
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
Cultural differences...
if you live in Korea...

302
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,210
If you have a strong desire
to do music in Korea...

303
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:53,250
You'll get it gradually.

304
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:59,270
Keep using Korean even though you
speak like a baby or sound stupid.

305
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,190
[You Hee-yeol's heartfelt advice]

306
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,780
[JYP receives the song choice]

307
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,510
[What does his laugh mean?]

308
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,430
He'll sing this better than
"Right Here Waiting."

309
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,510
This is a great choice!

310
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:31,760
I'm singing The Jackson 5's
"Who's Lovin' You."

311
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:39,310
Michael Jackson's sweet voice
stood out in this song.

312
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,510
Bernard's voice is the
exact opposite.

313
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:50,040
It could be a twist if he can
sing it in his own style.

314
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:59,670
I wanted to show a different color since
I've been singing slow R&Bs and ballads.

315
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:04,110
I thought of an exciting song
and chose this one.

316
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,430
This will show us a
new side to him.

317
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:13,810
He was always slow but now
we will see his sense of rhythm.

318
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,290
[No. 1 Bernard Park]

319
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,120
It was a powerful performance
as if he was exploding with soul.

320
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,220
You just watched the performance
by No. 1 Bernard Park.

321
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,920
Let's hear the commentaries.

322
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,440
Bernard sang a different genre and
I saw a different side to him.

323
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,990
This is a Blues style music
in 6/8 time signature.

324
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:32,770
This is hard for Korean singers
to sing since it's like old pop.

325
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:39,240
He could have sounded unctuous
even if just one thing went wrong.

326
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:47,300
But he sang with his unadorned
voice and powerful timbre.

327
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,780
I really enjoyed it.

328
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Bernard's specialty is
the first measure.

329
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,740
You have the power to bring us
to our knees with the first measure.

330
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,410
Antenna Music's score...

331
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,210
What is his score after
all those compliments?

332
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,180
It's going up...

333
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,710
It's 97!

334
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:21,690
Next is JYP. I'm curious because
your looks changed in the middle.

335
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,360
Just as You Hee-yeol said
about the first measure...

336
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:34,000
He started off by perfectly doing
an ad-lib in the pentatonic scale.

337
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,210
I thought I was going
to get KO'd but...

338
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,710
As soon as the lyrics came out...

339
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,690
I felt he was singing
regardless of the lyrics.

340
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,000
You did sing well, but the lyrics
are sad and heartbreaking.

341
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,130
It felt the lyrics were gone.

342
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,390
I don't know... maybe it's because
I already knew what the lyrics are.

343
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,520
You were singing but it felt like
the heart was missing.

344
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:12,700
You just sang well without the heart.
I was taken aback and it was a pity.

345
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:16,280
But since you have class,
JYP's score...

346
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,970
We couldn't understand since
we don't know the lyrics.

347
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,780
The score is... 92!

348
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:26,550
The sentiment part wasn't
good enough. YG?

349
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:35,410
It would be great if I knew the
6/8 time signature and the lyrics.

350
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,750
I just look for the feel.

351
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,680
I said in the video clip that this
is a different style from his.

352
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,480
It's the most rhythmical song
that he sang until now.

353
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,470
Since Michael Jackson
had a sweet voice...

354
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:05,230
I was both anticipating and worrying
how he would sing this in his lows.

355
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,940
I agree a little with JYP.

356
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:15,570
I thought at the first measure, "This
heavyweight knows how to punch now."

357
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:23,400
I was really shocked at each
measure but wasn't KO'd.

358
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:31,050
My expectations grew because the
Richard Marx song you sang moved me.

359
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,660
YG's score...

360
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:37,360
It wasn't a good commentary.
What is his score?

361
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,780
It's 93!

362
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,040
He has 282.

363
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:50,180
Those cheering for Bernard Park can
text "1" or "Bernard Park" to #0606.

364
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,720
Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

365
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,630
This stage was by
No. 1 Bernard Park!

366
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,240
[No. 2 Kwon Jina]

367
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,550
[With the elimination of The Shorties...
Kwon Jina is the sole female contestant]

368
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:13,740
It is a blessing to
make it into TOP3.

369
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,980
But I felt sad as I saw
them all leave.

370
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,870
I thought it would be okay...

371
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,520
But the place was quieter
and emptier than I thought.

372
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,330
So I tried to make it
as noisy as possible.

373
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:43,650
[That's when her friends
became her comfort]

374
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:51,830
I really miss you too!

375
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,280
[She's in good spirits after being
encouraged by her friends]

376
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,540
[But one day]

377
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,740
[She visits JYPE to practice
her collaboration stage]

378
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,290
[Who is she performing with?]

379
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,430
[It's JYP's sexy charismatic Sunmi]

380
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,550
[She's very surprised
and is dumbfounded]

381
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,970
- I'm Sunmi.
- Hello.

382
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,450
How old are you?

383
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,980
I'm 18...

384
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,800
I'll dispense with formality
since I'm older than you.

385
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,490
[That's an honor for me]

386
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,620
You sang an acoustic version
of "24 Hours" last time.

387
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:37,690
What about doing a dance
version of "24 Hours"?

388
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,360
I'm dancing that song barefoot?

389
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,930
[Jina is doing this dance?]

390
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,860
Want to learn it now?

391
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,150
Now?

392
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:53,660
[They start practicing]

393
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,370
[How do I do that?]

394
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:58,110
[Oh God! Why did you
make me do this?]

395
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,660
[Sunmi teaches her step by step]

396
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,670
Jina, how old are you?

397
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,980
[What happened to the flexibility
of this growling goddess?]

398
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,790
I might ruin it if
I don't dance well.

399
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,940
Since I've been given
the opportunity...

400
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,620
I think of it as an honor
and will do my best.

401
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,490
[We'll watch their stage later!]

402
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,460
[Then what is she singing?]

403
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,000
[Primary's "Love"]

404
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:40,530
I've been singing quiet
and sentimental songs.

405
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:46,860
I chose this song to show
another exciting performance.

406
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:54,510
Jina is the only one from the three
who can control her voice skillfully.

407
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:55,940
That's frightening.

408
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:03,880
The most important thing for a singer is
to have one's color, style, and timbre.

409
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,800
Jina already had those
from the start.

410
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,370
Jina would debut the quickest
from among the three.

411
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,200
I don't know if I'll be
3rd, 2nd, or 1st place...

412
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:23,320
But I'll do my best
thinking it's my last.

413
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,940
[No. 2 Kwon Jina]

414
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,700
[Music director - Kwon Tae-eun
Bandmaster - Seo Young-do]

415
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:05,690
This stage was by Kwon Jina and she
showed potential as a dancing singer.

416
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:13,090
What do the judges have to say?
Who will pick up the mike first?

417
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:15,060
JYP?

418
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,810
After Kwon Jina performs
and on my way home...

419
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:25,930
Recorded versions of the songs
come out and I listen to them.

420
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:31,850
Even YG said it but it's safe to say that
you have the skills to do a recording.

421
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:36,650
But there are some unfortunate
things on the live stage...

422
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,460
Since our expectations are high
and I thought what that might be.

423
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:48,230
We got used to your
soft, resounding voice.

424
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:54,910
There are singers that sing
as if burning their soul.

425
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:00,470
Aretha Franklin in the '70s, Pattie LaBelle
in the '80s, and Chaka Khan in the '90s.

426
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:06,550
You should listen to such singers
if you're going to sing live.

427
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:16,090
It was a pity that maybe you stopped
showing what you've been showing.

428
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,350
JYP's score...

429
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,070
What is his score?

430
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,510
It's 93!

431
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,270
Next is... YG?

432
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,240
This is a very important round.

433
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,810
It'll be great if the contestant got
the best score for doing well.

434
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,720
I thought about that
as I watched.

435
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:53,000
Since Kwon Jina showed many great
performances, I also agree with JYP.

436
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:05,720
Kwon Jina gives off the most beautiful
voice with just a guitar melody.

437
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,430
Maybe she had a lot on her mind
dancing and doing other things.

438
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,790
Like JYP said, it's a pity
since it wasn't new and...

439
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:23,110
It didn't go beyond your
previous performance.

440
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,870
YG's score...

441
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,660
She had more criticism than
compliments since it's the TOP3.

442
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,610
The score is 93!
It's the same.

443
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,290
You Hee-yeol?

444
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:45,060
I said this before that it's impossible even
for pro musicians to do this every week.

445
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,340
There are many such shows
and it's really hard.

446
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,140
We have amateurs here
doing this every week.

447
00:41:54,140 --> 00:42:00,600
One of Kwon Jina's greatest strength
is that she never looked nervous.

448
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:04,040
I never thought she was nervous
and another thing is....

449
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,780
Song choice is important for some
contestants but for Kwon Jina...

450
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,850
She rose not because of song choice
but because she is Kwon Jina.

451
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:23,910
You're stable and just as he said,
you have no problems debuting right now.

452
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,190
Antenna Music's score...

453
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,630
The score is...

454
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,280
It's 97!

455
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,270
She has 283! It's a point
more than Bernard Park.

Those cheering for Kwon Jina can

he hoped for?]

[It really is 2NE1!]

475
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,500
I only bought three drinks.

477
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,820
None for you then.

478
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:09,870
I'm sorry.

and made it to TOP3!]

482

484

I wanted to give you something since
your throat hurt and you lost your voice.

485

[Supplements good for the
throat used by Dara!]

486

[He's red again]

487
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:52,130
It's great that I was able to
actually meet awesome people.

488
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,560
Since 2NE1 told me
to do my best...

489
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,560
I'll do my best and create
a better performance.

[After getting recharged by 2NE1,
what song did he choose?]

491

[What song surprised JYP?]

493
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,170
["Honey" with words
and music by JYP]

494
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,970
It'll be competitive because
out of all of JYP's songs...

495
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:25,000
"Honey" is the grooviest.

496

Sam...

497
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,160
He won't be into the rhythm
but playing on top of it.

498

[No. 3 Sam Kim]

This stage was by Sam Kim, a
sentimentalist and prince of groove.

That was a great performance. How did his
carefree performance move the judges?

504
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:24,720
JYP?

505
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,700
I think Sam should
change his name.

506
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,770
To what?

507
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:30,990
- To Soul Kim.
- Soul Kim.

508
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,160
I'll be making this short but
there's one thing I have to say.

509
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,530
This song is in the blues scale.

510
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:50,310
But he tossed that away and
changed it to a minor scale.

511
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,890
That isn't easy.
It's really hard.

512
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:04,100
He changed it to a minor scale
but sang in a blues scale.

513
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,990
And he played the interlude
in a blues scale.

514
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,890
I don't know if he knew that
or not but he's a musician.

515
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,070
It's frightening if he didn't know.

516
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:26,110
He is Korea's precious
young musician.

517
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:27,220
JYP's score...

518
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,950
I'm curious of the score
due to all the compliments.

519
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:34,300
It's 99!

520
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,790
99 is the highest today!

521
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,640
You Hee-yeol?

522
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,060
I was really curious how
he will start off the song.

523
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,110
I never imagined he would
render the intro like that.

524
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,700
It was a shocking intro,
and the second thing...

525
00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:00,220
Sam always does a guitar solo.
How will he play it? It was shocking.

526
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:06,790
Those people over there are
Korea's best session musicians.

527
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,950
A 16-year-old is creating harmony
with them shoulder to shoulder.

528
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:19,100
He's putting on a flashy performance
with just a guitar as if this is Inkigayo.

529
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,880
JYP said it's frightening
if he did it without knowing.

530
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,210
- Sam Kim doesn't know.
- He doesn't know?

531
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:32,420
It's instinct. That's why
we call him a genius.

532
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,820
Antenna Music's score...

533
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:39,810
What's the score? He was complimented
that it's instinct and not learned...

534
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:41,700
It's 99!

535
00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:48,270
Let me confirm one thing.
Did you know or not?

536
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:52,040
I put in what sounded good
so I did it without knowing.

537
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,720
I don't think he understood.

538
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,150
YG?

539
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,600
I would first like to
thank Sam Kim.

540
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:10,340
This TOP3 is a very
important round.

541
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:16,800
Bernard Park, Kwon Jina, and Sam Kim
gave a moving performance every round.

542
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,340
But Bernard and Jina's performances
weren't as moving as before.

543
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,860
I thought at least Sam should show
something because he's going last.

544
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,030
And he did show something.

545
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:37,360
He made the best song choice.

546
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,350
He made the best arrangement.

547
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:46,270
Third compliment is that
he's crisis resistant.

548
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:54,050
He's making a frightening upturn
compared to the other contestants.

549
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,870
His skill in amazing us,
the judges, in every round...

550
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:06,300
You Hee-yeol talked about the session
musicians and they're Korea's best.

551
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,240
It's amazing that a
16-year-old is composed.

552
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,320
That can only be seen in a
20-year veteran musician.

553
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,010
I'll make it short.
YG's score...

554
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:23,020
He was complimented on singing,
playing, and everything. The score is...

555
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,370
It's 100!

556
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:31,730
He has 298!
It's a high score.

557
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:38,830
Those cheering for Sam Kim can
text "3" or "Sam Kim" to #0606.

558
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:41,470
Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

559

No. 3 Sam Kim!

[The stage everyone's
been waiting for!]

562
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,630
We imagined how it would feel
to release our first album.

563
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,550
We're closer to our dream
because of KPOP STAR.

564
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,380
It's an amazing opportunity
given to us by KPOP STAR.

565
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,060
[Akdong Musician's debut stage
will be shown in a few moments!]

566
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:13,650
Sam Kim, the dark horse of live broadcast,
is No. 1 with the best compliments.

567
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:19,650
He's first with 298, but Bernard and
Jina have a one point difference.

568
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:23,150
This is when your votes
become the deciding factor.

569
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:26,450
Please hurry if you
haven't voted yet.

570

A new performance you haven't
seen before will start now.

571
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:39,140
The TOP3 prepared with artists from
JYP, YG, and Antenna Music.

572
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:44,950
The first stage was with JYP.
We should ask JYP about it.

573
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,400
JYP, how is it?

574
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:55,740
Kwon Jina only showed great singing, but
this is a special stage and not a competition.

575
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:02,260
We wanted her to experience something new
and wish that it will help her in the future.

576
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,420
She will be dancing as she sings.

577
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:13,060
I look forward to another dance
other than her "Growl" dance.

578
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,310
A big hand to the first stage!

579
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,110
[24 Hours - Sunmi]

580
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:39,340
That was a great performance
by Kwon Jina and Sunmi.

581
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:46,940
You Hee-yeol could feel nervous.
What did Antenna Music prepare?

582
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:54,370
Peppertones and Park Sae Byul
prepared with Bernard Park.

583
00:58:54,370 --> 00:59:00,780
We tried to make the best performance
according to Bernard's color.

584
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:04,650
It's Extreme's "More Than Words."

585
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,830
Alright. How harmonious
will the performance be?

586
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,610
Bernard Park, Peppertones, and
Park Sae Byul are up next!

587
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:08,770
It was as if they've been doing
it together for a long time.

588
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:12,040
We look forward to the last one.

589
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,890
YG, how is it?

590
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:23,300
Sam Kim and 2NE1 prepared it.

591
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,890
But I don't know
what they're doing.

592
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:30,970
I was busy and didn't see them and
don't know what they're singing.

593
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,260
I hope they do better than
the ones that already did it.

594
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,070
Alright.

595
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:42,040
We're more curious of Sam's looks
next to Dara than his singing.

596
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:44,450
This is the last one!

597
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:01,270
Sam's adorable look was
memorable in that performance.

598
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:07,040
These great performances can
only be seen on KPOP STAR.

Of the 3 likely winners, only 2
will advance to next week's finale.

We have another special stage
as the votes are being tallied.

full-fledged rookie artists of YGE.

two title tracks for the first time.

I heard Chan-hyuk came up
with the stage for "200%."

618

I think the music charts
will be fluctuating soon.

like them in a year here on this stage.

here again after a year as a singer?

643

I was very nervous and couldn't see
anyone or the judges. It was dark.

audience's faces today.

01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:06,320
Bernard, how do you feel right now?

668
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:10,150
I'm nervous and...

669
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:17,680
I'm grateful to have
made it to TOP3.

670
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,700
It was fun until now.

671
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:24,380
Does that mean we'll see
you again next week?

672
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:25,020
Huh?

673
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,870
My English is improving daily.

674
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:35,130
Kwon Jina? How are you feeling?

675
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:43,700
I'm nervous but have no regrets.
It's okay even if I'm eliminated.

676
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:47,270
Anything that was unfortunate
with your performance?

677
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:49,550
I sang out of tune
in the middle.

678
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,010
- You what?
- Sang out of tune.

679
01:22:52,010 --> 01:22:53,530
That was a pity.

680
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:58,790
I see. I think the judges
missed that. Anyways.

681
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:03,080
Sam Kim, how do you feel?
We're waiting for the announcement.

682
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,360
I'm really nervous...

683
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:11,870
I had fun so I have no regrets
even if I'm eliminated.

684
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:13,670
- Thank you.
- Alright.

685
01:23:13,670 --> 01:23:16,310
It's amazing to make
it even to TOP3.

686
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:21,180
JYP, you watched with a pleased
look. Any words for them?

687
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:27,060
I'm very proud of them. They are
Korea's young musicians.

688
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:32,210
I think they'll be stars leading
K-pop and the Korean Wave.

689
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:35,720
It's a big achievement to even
come this far. You did well.

690
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:39,170
And YG? We haven't made
the announcement yet.

691
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:48,570
We won't be seeing one
of them after today.

692
01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:56,060
We don't know if it will be Bernard, Jina,
or Sam until we open the envelope.

693
01:23:57,930 --> 01:24:03,960
As I said last week,
they have similar skills.

694
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:07,380
Not one of them lags
behind the other.

695
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:14,840
We don't know yet, but I'm sad and
not happy in sending one away.

696
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:19,440
He said it's a pity to send
one away. You Hee-yeol?

697
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:24,070
We met almost every week and
got close the past 6 months.

698
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:32,040
You three did well and were
more than I imagined.

699
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:36,640
JYP described you as young musicians
but I would like to call you my peers.

700
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:40,300
Let's continue together.
Good job.

701
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:49,710
I will now announce the first
finalist for next week's finale!

702
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:52,490
[Who is the first finalist for
the long-awaited finale?]

703
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:05,730
I saw the name.

704
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:10,900
The long 8 months of Season 3
of KPOP STAR will come to an end.

705
01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:20,670
The first finalist to advance
to next week's finale is...

706
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:23,490
Please congratulate!
This person was great.

707
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,930
It's Sam Kim!

708
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:29,800
Congratulations!

709
01:25:31,730 --> 01:25:37,560
He gave an overwhelming performance
with the judges' score of 298.

710
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,690
Sam, how do you feel?

711
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,880
I'm really happy.

712
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:52,390
I'm always nervous before I go up,
but I try to do my best and have fun.

713
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:56,570
Just fun... I can't even
say it properly.

714
01:25:56,570 --> 01:26:02,150
It was fun. Thank you for your
support and I'll do my best.

715
01:26:02,150 --> 01:26:03,500
Alright.

716
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:05,880
If speaking in Korean is hard...

717
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,080
Thank you.

718
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:18,890
Anyone can tell he's first just by
the atmosphere here today.

719
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:23,630
Congratulations and please
move to the winners seat.

720
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,330
Please give him a hand.

721
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:38,870
Between Bernard Park and Kwon Jina,
only one will advance to the finale.

722
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:42,630
Bernard Park has 282.

723
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,670
Kwon Jina has 283.

724
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:51,270
It's just a point difference
looking at the judges' score.

725
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:58,100
Then the viewers' votes will
be the deciding factor.

726
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:04,590
Which judge will announce
next week's finalist?

727
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:08,500
I'll do it.

728
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:17,240
Since JYP always rooted for Bernard Park and
You Hee-yeol has affection for Kwon Jina...

729
01:27:17,240 --> 01:27:20,100
I think I'll be less nervous
to make the announcement.

730
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:25,610
Alright. Please open the envelope
and slowly make the announcement.

731
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:33,600
Who is the second finalist
for next week's finale?

732
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,110
[Who is the last finalist?]

733
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:42,710
Is it Bernard Park or Kwon Jina?

734
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:46,060
There's only a point difference
looking at the judges' score.

735
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:55,130
Calculating the viewers' vote,
who is in the lead?

736
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:58,410
I think YG saw it.

737
01:27:58,410 --> 01:28:01,250
Alright.

738
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:06,180
The last finalist is...

739
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:14,070
Calculating the remaining 40%
from the viewers' votes...

740
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:19,810
Was there an upturn
or not in the results?

741
01:28:19,810 --> 01:28:20,900
Who is it?

742
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,370
I will announce it.

743
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:27,450
The last finalist is...

744
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:29,860
- Bernard Park.
- It's Bernard Park!

745
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:31,980
Congratulations!

746
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:41,900
Bernard Park and Sam Kim
advance to the finale.

747
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:50,790
Let's first ask Bernard
how he feels right now.

748
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:58,080
I never thought of the finale
when I came to Korea.

749
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,780
Now...

750
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:05,060
I'll do my best
and do better.

751
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:06,990
Thank you so much.

752
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,320
Congratulations.

753
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:14,960
Kwon Jina, you were always complimented
and today became your last performance.

754
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,280
How do you feel?

755
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,070
I have mixed feelings but...

756
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:25,680
I did my best to show something
better so I have no regrets.

757
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,340
I see. Is there anything you
want to say to the judges?

758
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:33,510
Thank you for the compliments
and for your troubles.

759
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:35,040
Thank you.

760
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,380
You Hee-yeol was attached to her.
Please say some words for her.

761
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:48,220
I don't know what to say.

762
01:29:48,220 --> 01:29:55,870
But I am sure of one thing.
The result here is not the end.

763
01:29:55,870 --> 01:29:57,860
This is just the beginning.

764
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:02,560
You shined the most
in that beginning.

765
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:09,240
It was great that I was a part of it.
I look forward to working with you.

766
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:16,090
He encouraged and cheered her by
saying something meaningful.

767
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:23,800
Only one show remains and
that is the finale next week.

768
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,070
Who will be the 3rd K-pop star?

769
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:29,800
Unfortunately, Kwon Jina
was eliminated.

770
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,880
We continue next week with
Bernard Park and Sam Kim.

771
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,100
After a long journey of 8 months,
we have reached the final hurdle.

772
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:42,360
Please look forward to
next week's live show.

773
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:46,440
This was KPOP STAR Season 3, a real
audition where dreams turn into reality!

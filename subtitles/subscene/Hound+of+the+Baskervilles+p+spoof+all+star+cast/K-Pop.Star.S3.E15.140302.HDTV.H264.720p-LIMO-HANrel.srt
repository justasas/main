And 2 teams will be eliminated today.

174

The role of the audience judging panel is
crucial in choosing who is eliminated.

after Group A's battle ends.

180
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,340

candidates for elimination.

181
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,370
The same goes for Group B.

182
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:33,210

2nd, and 3rd place will advance.

but he came out right away.

223
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,360
I see, Group B. I think he wants to
be fourth since he wants to go last.

224
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,370

338
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,460
I think you were the most nervous
today out of all your performances.

339
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,770
[Burden and tension of performing
before an audience for the first time]

340
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:51,000
But I understand because Sam is 16 and
performing before an audience for the first time.

341
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,020
You arranged it differently from
G-Dragon and sang in a different voice.

342
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,070
It's not an exaggeration to call it
your song since you sang in your style.

343
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,290
I felt uneasy but it was a good
performance. Good job.

344
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,390
[Sam is complimented by YG,
the producer of this song]

345
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:25,170
The TOP10 battle is like the playoffs.
The regular season is over now.

346
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:34,380
The good teams in the playoffs
have solid fundamentals.

347
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:41,410
The one thing I'm worried about you
and feel pity is the fundamentals.

348
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,860
[Sam lacks the fundamentals!]

349
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,920
It didn't drag you down that much but
I'm worried that it'll start to drag you.

350
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,550
It's because you're young and
weren't properly educated.

351
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:01,250
You exhale too much.

352
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:06,430
Singing becomes hard for you since
you need to inhale a lot inbetween.

353
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,040
You'll injure yourself because
you strain at the high notes.

354
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:22,990
If you strengthen your fundamentals,
you'll become a great musician and singer.

355
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,980
You have the talents for it.
I enjoyed it.

356
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,440
[The standards are higher and the
commentaries more objective]

357
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,420
[What is You Hee-yeol's
commentary?]

358
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:42,060
I'm pleased because we talked a lot
about your rhythm and beats.

359
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:47,850
The best way to correct that
is to perform with a band.

360
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:58,440
The experience itself in performing with a
full band is a gift to you by KPOP STAR.

361
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,980
You're only 16.

362
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,140
You're just a year older than
the girl in All Chae.

363
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:14,950
We were expecting a lot from you
because of your mature looks.

364
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:25,940
I always think how you can play the guitar
like that and have such musical talents.

365
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:33,780
I can already imagine how well
you'll do later in your 20s.

366
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:41,640
You wore like GD but didn't
look anything like him.

367
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:48,980
- Anyways, you were first...
- He looks like GE, no?

368
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,510
I'm sorry.

369
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,400
Lucky for you that this
isn't the live show.

370
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,420
[No use crying over spilt milk...]

371
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,070
Anyways, you did well for going first.
We give you a big hand.

372
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,260
Thank you.

373
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,190
[Sam was complimented and
pointed out for his performance]

374
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,090
Since you just performed, anything
you would like to say to the judges?

375
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,410
Thank you. I really thank you.

376
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:30,490
Honestly, I know I'm eliminated.

377
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,350
I truly thank you.
While on KPOP STAR...

378
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:46,220
- I really learned a lot...
- That isn't true. We don't know.

379
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:51,270
Nobody knows, right?

380
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,390
- Nobody knows yet.
- We really don't know.

381
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:00,660
This stage was by Sam Kim!

382
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,290
[He finished his performance
which could be his last]

383
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,180
[But there are people that
cheer him with a big hand]

384
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,610
[Will Sam be able to continue?]

385
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:28,570
Second is the Shorties!

386
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,130
[The Shorties' stage!]

387
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,160
[The Shorties' family came
from Daegu by train]

388
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,780
[They look more nervous than usual...]

389
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,560
Did you expect to make it to
the TOP10 when you applied?

390
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,750
- Nope!
- Never!

391
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,630
We didn't expect it.

392
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:06,700
We went to many different auditions
separately but we never made the cut.

393
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,480
This is the first time that
we came out together.

394
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,360
[During the Busan preliminaries]

395
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,370
[They had already shown
their exceptional talents]

396
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,480
We thought we would get
eliminated at Round 1.

397
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,760
It's because we were ordinary...

398
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,310
It's amazing that we're here
and we're still bewildered.

399
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,750
[The Shorties are training hard
for the TOP10 performance!]

400
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:47,110
[But!]

401
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,110
[Maybe it's due to too much practice but
their body condition became worse!]

402
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,390
[They finally went to the hospital...]

403
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,820
It's H1N1.

404
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,990
[Shock]

405
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,480
You'll recover around Wednesday
or Thursday of next week.

406
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,440
[But the performance is on Monday!]

407
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,550
[Moreover!]

408
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:18,180
I went to see an ENT doctor...
there was a cyst in my vocal cords.

409
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:21,440
The doctor said something shocking.

410
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,820
It looks like Reinke's edema...
these are pseudocysts.

411
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,930
- You're the most serious.
- Excuse me?

412
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,710
You might need an operation if that
goes on or becomes severe.

413
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,420
[A desperately dangerous situation
where she can't overuse her voice!]

414
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,960
I'm someone who'll
continue singing...

415
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,890
But that could become difficult
if this continues on...

416
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,900
So I have a lot of worries.

417
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:52,610
And we felt sorry to each other
to say, "Let's continue practicing."

418
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,160
That was uncomfortable
so it was really hard.

419
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,030
But we went through a lot
to make it this far...

420
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:08,660
So we'll hang in there and
make a great performance.

421
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:20,180
I haven't really done anything
to make my mom proud.

422
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:28,500
But I think I made her proud
by performing on this stage.

423
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,810
It was worth it and
I'm thankful.

424
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,210
My dad participated in the
International Topless Marathon.

425
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:46,000
We wrote "SBS K-pop The Shorties"
on his chest and ran like that.

426
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,490
He showed me on his cell phone,
"Tae-kyung, look at this."

427
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,280
I was surprised, "Dad!
You ran like that?"

428
00:38:54,910 --> 00:39:01,090
After making it to the TOP10, it's the
first time our family will be watching.

429
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,770
We don't want to disappoint them.

430
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:11,840
We'll make it a performance where even the
judges and audience won't be disappointed.

431
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,050
[A-2, The Shorties]

432
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:23,000
[Ryu Tae-kyung's aunt]

433
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,210
[Yeo In-hye's mother]

434
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:28,080
[Na-jin's mother is already
moist with tears...]

435
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:34,800
[Brown City - Browneyed Soul]

436
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,630
[Park Na-jin's father]

437
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,030
[Park Na-jin's mother]

438
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,170
[Wild cheers!]

439
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:44,930
The Shorties were second and just sang
"Brown City" by Browneyed Soul.

440
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,260
Let's hear the commentaries.

441
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,520
[You Hee-yeol goes first!]

442
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:06,210
Your previous performances were sung
to the piano accompaniment.

443
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:14,080
The compositions were charming
and like a musical.

444
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,850
But this time, you
went head-to-head.

445
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:24,590
It's not easy for your voices to be heard
above a full band especially with the brass.

446
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,820
But your voices were above it.

447
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,710
The sound reached us here.
You truly are something.

448
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,840
You feel like pros now.

449
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:47,150
Another thing is that I didn't know it was
the Shorties because of the clothes.

450
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,560
Especially Na-jin.

451
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:56,990
It feels like I'm seeing someone else.
It's as if you're out for blood.

452
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,980
Your performance drilled it in deeply
that this is actually the TOP10 match.

453
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,380
It feels like part 2 of
the Shorties is starting.

454
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,590
- Good job.
- Thank you.

455
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:13,800
[This performance showed another
development of the Shorties!]

456
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:19,750
I agree with You Hee-yeol.

457
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,370
The contents are the same but
the thoughts are opposite.

458
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,050
[What does he mean?]

459
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,470
Your skills improved. That's true.

460
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,830
Your voices were above the
accompaniment. That's true.

461
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:39,480
But I'm worried about that.

462
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,060
Since you sang throughout trying
to sing loud and powerful...

463
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,670
Your natural voices disappeared.

464
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:56,740
Singers have this mike.

465
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:04,040
Try to rely on the mike and sing
as if you're singing in your voice.

466
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,720
If you do pass, place trust in the mike
and sing comfortably and naturally...

467
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,360
If you return to the voices when
you had fun, I think it'll be better.

468
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,070
That was a pity.

469
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,490
[What is YG's commentary?]

470
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,170
I was taking notes while
you were singing.

471
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,080
And I was thinking of giving
a good commentary.

472
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:40,240
But it's the first time that the
judges had the same commentary.

473
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,360
Just as You Hee-yeol articulated...

474
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,480
Despite the loud sounds of the drums
and brass, their voices were above them.

475
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,940
I would like to compliment
you on that point.

476
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,950
Compared to soccer, the goalie
and players on defense...

477
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:06,420
Since this is an important round,
they ran to the front and made a goal.

478
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,700
This performance was new
compared to previous ones.

479
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,110
"Wow, they could do
something like this?"

480
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,420
[Their new strength stood out
in this performance!]

481
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,780
I wanted to compliment first
because I felt that.

482
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:23,960
- Good job.
- Thank you.

483

[Their family are now at ease...]

484
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,880
This stage was by the Shorties.
Please remember it.

485
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,390
They'll return to their seats.

486
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:44,160
The Shorties are very
beautiful today.

487
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,490
Very beautiful.

488
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,500
[They're innocent for
their makeover!]

489
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,180
You've been hiding your beauty.

490

showed a new potential?]

- Were you well?
- Yes.

497
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:27,260
I saw you waving
from over there...

498
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,130
Who were you waving at?

499
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,520
My parents and sister came...

[Her family came from
Busan to cheer her]

- Completely.

Your clothes look nice.

503
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,420
Thank you.

504
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,120
You may begin.

505
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,810
[He tries to make her feel
relaxed before starting]

506
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:07,180
No one in my family is into music
so they were adamantly against it.

507
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:18,780
They thought I would continue in my studies
and didn't think I would become a singer.

508
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:25,730
But my sister supported me saying,
"She needs to go on this path."

509
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:31,610
When I was discouraged for
not making it last season...

510
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:37,220
She said, "Other singers went to hundreds
of auditions. How many times did you go?"

511
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:45,390
Her support and the courage she gave
allowed me to come this far.

512
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,650
You applied last year?

513
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,990
Yes, but I didn't make the
regional preliminaries.

514
00:48:52,010 --> 00:49:00,080
My dad boasted to his friends showing a
clip of me saying, "That's my daughter."

515
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,610
And my mom became a star
among her students.

516
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:12,550
It's been a while since I saw
my friends because I'm from Busan.

517
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,520
I really miss them...

518
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,520
I want to chat with them
when I see them.

519
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,090
[So we came to Busan!]

520
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,260
[She wore her school uniform and
now she's in the 11th grade]

521
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,820
[She came to school to be assigned
to her classes and get her books]

522
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:33,920
[She visited her old classroom
when she was in the 10th grade]

523
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,910
I used to goof off and lie down on
these lockers and get in trouble.

524
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:49,070
We used to gather
around this mirror.

525
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:52,260
What's wrong with my hair?
Oh! The bell's ringing!

526
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,060
[It's bringing back old memories]

527
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,580
[She misses her friends even more
being in the empty classroom]

528
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,550
[But?]

529
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:05,430
[Who's that hanging around
outside the classroom?]

530
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,230
[Surprise visit by her friends!]

531
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,760
[This is how girls react
when they're happy]

532
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,720
[They greet each other
after calming down]

533
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,440
- Did you dye your hair?
- Yup.

534
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,610
[Her friends are amazed at
how beautiful she became]

535
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,750
Seeing you makes me feel like
I returned to the past...

536
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:31,790
[Seeing her friends fills
her with emotion]

537
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:34,900
You sound like a Seoulite.

538
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,070
[Is she more comfortable
speaking in a Seoul accent?]

539
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,800
You're already a star.

540
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:48,110
I came to get my books and
get classes assigned but...

541
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:53,670
I'm thankful that they were
happy to see me...

542
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:59,100
They told me to do well and that
they were cheering and watching me.

543
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:02,150
It really moved me.

544
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:10,190
I'll try hard and do my best since
a lot of people are cheering for me.

545
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,880
I'm singing Primary's "See Through."

546
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,630
[An exciting song in the soul, punk
genres but based on hip-hop]

547
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:23,750
When I sang "I Need a Girl"...

548
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:32,860
JYP said that I sing sad songs well
but can't sing exciting songs.

549
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,840
I'm going to show that
I can sing an exciting song.

550
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:44,250
The original song is in a hip-hop style
but I arranged it in an acoustic style.

551
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:47,260
You'll feel something different.

552
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:53,120
[A-3, Kwon Jin-ah]

553
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,990
[What will her performance be like?]

554
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,520
[See Through (ft. Gaeko, Zion.T) - Primary]

555
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:08,950
[Breaks into applause]

556
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:22,300
[JYP grabs the mike right away]

557
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,320
I said earlier that teams with solid
fundamentals win the playoffs.

558
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,510
You really have solid fundamentals.

559
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:37,030
And you improved each round during
this season of KPOP STAR.

560
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,580
I said there were contestants with
too much air in their voice...

561
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,830
And there were contestants that
strain their throat to sing powerfully.

562
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:54,770
Sometimes you have air and no air.
Your voice is solid then soft...

563
00:55:54,770 --> 00:56:00,360
Being able to play around with the tone
is fact of your solid fundamentals.

564
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:07,980
I was mesmerized when you sang
the high notes in the middle.

565
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:16,430
I personally think that you made the most
improvement in singing this season.

566
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,100
Your performance was flawless.

567
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,930
I really enjoyed it
and you did well.

568
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,340
[She received the best
compliment ever!]

569
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,650
[The next contestant is
getting more nervous...]

570
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:36,220
Being with JYP for 3 years made me
to see distinct features in his evaluation.

571
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,710
His voice is raised an octave
when he really likes something.

572
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,600
[JYP can't hide what he likes]

573
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:49,210
The viewers might have
felt this as well.

574
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:56,850
Singing well and high in auditions,
and the many things JYP pointed out...

575
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:03,770
Relaxing the shoulders, keeping the chin in,
and singing as if speaking are all important.

576
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:10,200
But the most important thing is
how well one can lead the song.

577
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:18,480
Kwon Jin-ah led this song well.

578
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,980
She didn't stand out for me
among the TOP10 finalists.

579
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:30,220
But I'm seeing her a little
and able to see her charms.

580
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:34,320
I would like to compliment her.

581
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,480
It was exciting and she wasn't nervous.
That's how well she steered the song.

582
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,550
- Good job.
- Thank you.

583
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,100
[And You Hee-yeol?]

584
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,450
Your strength is...

585
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:04,840
No matter what song you sing,
it becomes your song.

586
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:11,890
This was Primary's "See Through"
but the original is completely different.

587
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:21,020
It's as if she has a filter and it comes
out saying, "This is my song."

588
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,910
It's delicious when you sing.

589
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:28,510
The first measure, B part, and
chorus are all different.

590
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:34,950
Compared to a drama,
it has all the four steps.

591
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,740
Above all, you look natural
when you sing.

592
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:46,890
You don't look unnatural or
look as if you're trying.

593
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:55,530
Kwon Jin-ah looks mature but
she's now in the 11th grade.

594
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:04,650
Now I'm convinced that she
has unlimited potential.

595
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:06,660
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

596
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:12,900
[She was lavished with
compliments by the judges]

597
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,450
She's getting better
by the day.

598
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:20,450
What more is there to say?
It was the best!

599
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,520
It's game over!

600
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:29,120
[Will she make it to TOP8?]

601
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,560
Now it's our fourth contestant.

602
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:38,710
Next is Bernard Park!

603
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:03,070
We changed him into a suit from
his cardigans at JYPE but...

604
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,470
Now he wears it under the suit...

605
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,720
[He sure loves his cardigans]

606
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,560
It was a good compromise.

607
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,520
You may begin.

608
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,100
How do you feel after
making it to the TOP10?

609
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,260
I feel great.

610
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:35,040
My goal was to make it
to the TOP10.

611
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,710
What if you didn't make it?

612
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,060
Then...

613
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,780
I give up on music.

614
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,080
This was my final attempt...

615
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,490
[Is there something
we don't know?]

be happy even though he passed]

622
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:49,260
[And finally!]

623
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:58,520
[He decided to go to Korea

right choice in coming?

[Do the judges feel the same?]

630
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:14,670
In Bernard's case, we always
expected him to make it to TOP3.

631
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:21,680
The voice that he has is...

632
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:28,840
In the heavyweight class and
the others are lightweight.

633
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:34,780
We heard many of your
good points today...

634
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:42,660
I would like to give you a tip
in making it to the TOP3.

635
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:47,930
You're a heavyweight
but you look heavy.

636
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,060
I want your steps to be light
even though you're a heavyweight.

637
01:06:53,060 --> 01:07:00,290
Your rich, full voice and high notes are
great but your tone is a little heavy.

638
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:04,770
Your weakness is that your
singing sounds monotonous.

639
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:10,950
Your punches should be of heavyweight
but your steps need to be light.

640
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:14,690
If you correct that,
TOP3 will be possible.

641
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:21,310
This is an important round so I wanted
to give advice than compliments.

642
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,050
- You did well.
- Thank you.

643
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:27,690
[He heard harsh advice first]

644
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:30,690
[Next is You Hee-yeol]

645
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:36,230
This must have been your
most difficult song.

646
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:41,920
This is a very dramatic song.

647
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:50,340
It goes up from the bridge and
you go all out in falsetto later.

648
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:57,160
And this is gayo. You sang
a traditional ballad.

649
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,130
I watched with interest.

650
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:08,000
I had my doubts thinking all
you can sing are R&Bs.

651
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,490
But in this song...

652
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:18,420
It wasn't enough but you know
how they say class is forever.

653
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:25,300
Since you basically have
power in your voice...

654
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:30,260
You do have potential.
You did well.

655
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:34,270
[He received a positive commentary]

656
01:08:36,240 --> 01:08:42,470
The reason I fell for Bernard is
when he sang "End of the Road."

657
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:50,120
You simplified a song with
8 chords into 4 chords.

658
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,890
When you sang a
detailed song like that...

659
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,860
I thought, "Where did he
get such confidence?"

660
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,220
And I was moved by
that simplicity.

661
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:04,280
But...

662
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:10,660
You have this great power to
simplify detailed things.

663
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:17,520
But I'm thinking maybe you're
not able to do the opposite.

664
01:09:18,590 --> 01:09:25,850
It has to be more detailed,
especially so with gayo.

665
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,270
That's what I'm worried about.

666

Before you begin...

680
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:47,400
Your throat was in a bad condition
during the battle audition.

681
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,330
Is it better?

682
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,180
Yes, I can do well.

683
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,400
Really? That's a relief.

684
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:04,720
But this song is unexpected.

685
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,990
It's Song Chang-sik's
"Cigarette Store Girl."

686
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:14,310
I can't imagine how
they'll sing this.

687
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:22,360
Many made remakes of this song but
I don't think a mixed duet ever did it.

688
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:29,320
He's playing a show off
that's trying to hit on me.

689
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:34,470
I'm stuck-up saying,
"I don't like you."

690
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:40,990
We chose this song because it can
show our power and excitement.

691
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:44,420
Did you expect to make it to
TOP10 when you applied?

692
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:45,540
No.

693
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,780
We thought we couldn't even
make the booth preliminaries.

694
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,160
We were supposed to sing but danced,
wait, was it an impersonation?

695
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,910
I can impersonate Park Hyo-shin's
"A loud shout to the front!"

696
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,450
Can I dance?

697

[6 months ago, they wanted to
pass the preliminaries at least]

698
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:18,130
You know how we draw a picture
of our future when we're young.

699
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:23,560
I always drew myself
singing with a mike.

700
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,010
I guess this was my dream
since I was young.

701
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:34,890
I was part of a band in middle and
high school and continued music.

702
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:42,910
I was a trainee at a
small agency a year ago.

703
01:12:42,910 --> 01:12:51,900
After I stopped being a trainee,
I didn't think of being a singer.

704
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:56,580
It was hard and I thought,
"Maybe I can't be a singer."

705
01:12:56,580 --> 01:13:01,340
People around me say that I'm good
but I had nothing to prove that.

706
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:07,630
I put it aside and thought
this would be my last try.

707
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,830
And that is KPOP STAR.

708
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:16,600
Suddenly I'm in the TOP10
and I'm really thankful.

last time but my voice is much better now.

01:13:37,660 --> 01:13:41,140
So I'll do my best this time.

714
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:45,920

and make it to TOP8.

I took extreme care.

754
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:34,910
I wore a mask, drank 3-4 L of water
every day, and took my medication.

755
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:43,800
I asked because your throat wasn't in
a condition to recover that quickly.

756
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:52,080
You kept your throat warm, took water and
medication, and followed the doctor's orders...

757
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,980

760
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:15,780
You shouldn't be scolded for hurting
your throat or catching the cold.

761
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:19,930
Since that can happen no matter
how well you take care of yourself.

762
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:29,950
But the judges will scold you if you
talk loud with others and on the phone.

763
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:33,770
Taking care of yourself means to
not get sick before you do get sick.

764
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:38,980
And being careful to recover
when you do get sick.

765
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,160
That's taking care of yourself.
It doesn't mean not getting sick.

766
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:47,980
Such attitude is necessary if you're
going to do music all your life.

767
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:53,310

you were singing.

773
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:30,670
"I'm fine even though it's an artificial
flower without fragrance." It rhymed here.

[Even though it has no fragrance]

01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:53,570

because I'm sensitive...

778
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:58,570
How did they write such lyrics?
That's how good it was.

779

I congratulate you on
recovering your voice.

I want to say two things.

784
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,780
When Choi Rin rapped, this
part was really impressive.

785
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:27,750
"You make a pass in every city
but you can't hit on me."

786
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:30,510
It made a big impact.

787
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:36,670
I see you're very good at that
and would like to compliment you.

788
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:39,080
And the second thing is...

789
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:46,280
If you do get good results,
what can you do next time?

790
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:50,620
I can predict it now.

791
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:59,200
We complimented you last time despite
your throat condition because...

792
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,050
It was different.

793
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:11,480
Today was your trademark performance.
It was humorous with cute acting.

794
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:17,830

to go beyond that.

01:24:56,020 --> 01:25:01,550
Almeng was predictable.

833
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:06,320
It wasn't easy to choose
2 from the 4 teams.

834
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:10,160
We choose two after a
long discussion...

835
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:15,200
But the two that passed need to be
on their toes and give more effort.

836
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:20,500
And we hope the two that are
eliminated won't be discouraged.

837
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:28,630
2nd place for TOP8 is...

838
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:37,720
[All 4 teams received not that
good of a commentary!]

839
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:45,490
[Who did the judges
pick for 2nd place?]

840
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:51,310
It's the Shorties.

841
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,580
Congratulations.

842
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:11,560
The Shorties are second to advance.
Please tell us how you feel?

843
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,860
Thank you.

844
01:26:14,860 --> 01:26:18,590
We didn't know if
we would pass.

845
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,540
We were surprised.

846
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:28,170
Thank you for choosing us.
We'll do our best.

847
01:26:28,170 --> 01:26:30,000
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

848
01:26:31,340 --> 01:26:33,170
[The Shorties' Ryu Tae-kyung's aunt]

849
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:36,450
[They can't believe that
they're 2nd place]

850
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:47,050
Please announce the last team that will
advance to the TOP8 from Group A.

851
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:58,350
First...

852
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:06,610
I would like to say that the two that
didn't pass gave a great performance.

853
01:27:06,610 --> 01:27:11,510
All 3 teams did well but
were also lacking.

854
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:15,970
Please don't lose courage.

855
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:21,100
The final judgment will be made
by the audience judging panel.

856
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:27,280
This was very hard...

857
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:34,650
3rd place for TOP8 is...

858
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:38,010
[The best were gathered in
Group A the death group!]

859
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:42,010
[Bernard Park has a voice
that resonates in the heart]

860
01:27:42,010 --> 01:27:46,190
[Sam Kim is a guitar
genius with soul]

861
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,130
[Almeng is a witty ideas bank]

862
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:55,650
[Those not called will become
candidates for elimination!]

863
01:27:55,650 --> 01:28:03,890
[Who will be 3rd place?]

864
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:32,050
3rd place for TOP8 is...

865
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:35,410
[The best were gathered in
Group A the death group!]

866
01:28:35,410 --> 01:28:39,410
[Bernard Park has a voice
that resonates in the heart]

867
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:43,590
[Sam Kim is a guitar
genius with soul]

868
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:47,530
[Almeng is a witty ideas bank]

869
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:53,050
[Those not called will become
candidates for elimination!]

870
01:28:53,050 --> 01:29:01,290
[Who will be 3rd place?]

871
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,770
It's Almeng!

872
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:15,010
Congratulations. Almeng is
the third to advance.

873
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:17,830
[Almeng's Lee Hae-yong's mother]

874
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:22,080
[They calmly accept the results]

875
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,540
[Bernard Park and Sam Kim from Group A
are candidates for elimination!]

876
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,190
[Lee Hae-yong passed
but he doesn't smile]

877
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,270
[Even JYP doesn't feel good]

878
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:40,270
Hae-yong doesn't look happy.
What's wrong?

879
01:29:40,270 --> 01:29:42,770
Shouldn't you be happy for
advancing to the TOP8?

880
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:49,750
Bernard was my roommate
and I also had fun with Sam.

881
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:55,430
- I don't feel that great.
- I see. You feel sorry?

882
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:56,950
- Yes.
- I see.

883
01:29:56,950 --> 01:30:00,300
Anyways, the judges were discreet.

884
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:06,400
Kwon Jin-ah is 1st, the Shorties are 2nd,
and Almeng is 3rd from Group A.

885
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:12,380
They advance to the TOP8 live show.
Please give them a big hand.

886
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:25,880
Sam Kim and Bernard Park aren't eliminated.
They are just candidates for elimination.

887
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,800
I wonder how they feel.
Let's ask Sam first.

888
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,950
How do you feel?

889
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:37,330
It's a pity.

890
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,610
Let's give him a hand.

891
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:03,260
Why don't we hear what
Bernard has to say?

892
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,790
Let's give him a hand.

893
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:46,070
Please remember that the elimination candidates
from Group A are Sam Kim and Bernard Park.

894
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:51,170
With the elimination candidates from
Group B after they are done...

895
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:54,500
The last two teams for the
TOP8 will be decided by votes.

896
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,900
Please give them a big hand!

897
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,410
[They feel relieved after
coming down the stage]

898
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:08,830
- It's over now!
- Look at this sweat.

899
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:11,410
[They let out a sigh of relief]

900
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:14,830
[Bernard is in shock!]

901
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:23,660
[First time seeing this
side of Bernard!]

902
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:32,660
[Their names are placed on the ballots
for the candidates for elimination!]

903
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:39,730
[How many votes will they receive
from the audience judging panel?]

904
01:32:39,730 --> 01:32:45,260
[They enter the waiting room for the
candidates for elimination weakly]

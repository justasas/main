[The judges arrived 2 hours early]

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,540
The agency's pride is on the line and
there's an odd mix of emotions.

Since we train them and
present to the public...

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,420
This round gives us a
tremendous burden.

11
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,110
I couldn't sleep... maybe 2 hours.
I even had a stomachache...

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,620
It's like I'm taking an exam...
I've never been this nervous...

run into her...

32

I'm worried how I'll be compared to
Young-joo who has similar strengths.

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,980
It was a shock.

34

This group will be fierce but it's unavoidable
since there are strong ones in other groups.

105
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,690
This isn't about your singing anymore.
It's about who has more guts.

106

Who will forget everything and
lose yourself in singing?

107
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,990
That will be your victory.

108
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,160

113
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,110
But I'm concerned of your
throat's condition...

114
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:39,680
How bad is it?

115
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,250

- I don't have the flu.

- I practiced...
- A lot?

118
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,850

[What happened to her?]

120
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,450
Nam Young-joo has a
great voice and feel.

121
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,370
But she keeps on relying on that.
She needs to show off her singing.

122
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:12,850
So we chose a song that went
as low and high as possible.

123

[Toni Braxton's "Un-Break My Heart"]

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,660
You have to show that you can sing the
high notes since you never showed it.

126
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,920
I felt great at first when
I heard the song.

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,370
But it was hard when
I started singing it.

128
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,450
The emotions of this song were
different from what I'm used to.

129
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,180
It's not even in Korean and
I have to sing with pop vocals.

141

[The tears are about to fall

[Can she overcome her
worst difficulty?]

145
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,920
You chose Toni Braxton's
"Un-Break My Heart."

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:21,760
Until now, you heard you have
great feel but not singing.

147
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,280
You need singing skills
for this song.

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:32,410
This could be your challenge and hurdle.
It could also be a starting point.

You have to overcome it.

150

Everything becomes hard if you
think of trying to advance.

151

But everything becomes easy if you
just do your best in singing.

152

165
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,820
I enjoyed it.

166
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,070
I took your throat condition
into account as I listened.

167
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:29,830
Despite your circumstances,
you finished the match.

168
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:33,030
I want to applaud you for that.

169
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,120
It's the first time I heard you
sing like that in the chorus.

170
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:44,970
I haven't really heard you sing
in a strong tone for that part.

171
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,230
But you attempted that jump.

172
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,480
[She wasn't daunted by her throat
condition and sang the high notes...]

173
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,940
Attempting this song and this stage will
be a great help in your singing career.

174
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,750
[It was hard, but she took the
bold challenge in this stage...]

175
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,480
[She received a positive commentary
for attempting something new]

176
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,880
[YG has a heavy look.
What is his commentary?]

177
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,760
[It's not easy for him to speak]

178
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:24,250
The battle audition is an important
round determining the TOP10.

179
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:33,350
I completely understand JYP for
taking a risk with Nam Young-joo.

180
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,570
I also heard her throat is
in a bad condition.

181
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,670
This round is too important
to be taking risks.

182
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,030
I heard you many times, but
you used a voice you didn't use.

183
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,350
And you sang in voices
I never heard before.

184
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,650
It was like...

185
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:05,560
You sang in a key or two lower
than your tessitura.

186
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,690
[She did her best in that difficulty]

187
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,760
[But lost half her charm!]

188
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,090
This is really hard for me.
I have to watch what I say.

189
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:22,860
It was good to see you do your best
despite your bad condition.

190
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,580
[YG's commentary leaves
her in wanting!]

191
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,170
[Then what is JYP's commentary
since he saw her tough fight?]

192
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:45,590
If you want to succeed as a singer
for the rest of your life...

193
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,020
I thought it would be better
if your high notes were open.

194
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:54,120
I wanted to attempt that.

195
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,450
Changing one's vocalization
requires continuous efforts.

196
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:04,040
But you practiced a week and
couldn't practice for 2 weeks.

197
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:12,570
As Hee-yeol said, I compliment you
for finishing regardless of that.

198
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,140
[Finishes with a warm compliment...]

199
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,180
[She did her best despite the
many unfavorable conditions]

200
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,260
[What is her fate?]

201
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,980
Let's have our next contestant.

202
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,060
[YG's 1Minute]

203
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,570
There was a member change from
Jang Hanna to Abigail Kim.

204
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:49,080
Kim Soo-hyun shed tears and they had a
mental breakdown when I announced that.

205
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:59,280
I kept on crying since I was at a loss.
It wasn't because I hated it.

206
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,310
Everything had to start all over.

207
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:08,720
I didn't know how or where to begin.
So I actually cried a lot.

208
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,920
The feeling was different and
it was great when we started.

209
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,130
Now I think it's good.

210
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,520
Thanks.

211
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,020
It must have been hard
for you too, Abigail.

212
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,050
I was scared at first.

213
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,750
[A shocking confession]

214
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,640
They have strong voices but
also strong personalities.

215
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,710
I was worried, shocked,
and taken aback.

216
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,370
[Drastic measures to be a team!]

217
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,290
[Show us your talents, Abigail]

218
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,380
[It's not easy for her
to assimilate]

219
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,560
Don't be like that, Abi!

220
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,820
We tried hard to bring out
Abigail's talents.

221
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,000
[Trying hard = forcing her
to do random dances?]

222
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,900
[Her seal is removed]

223
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,020
As I kept on doing it,
they had bright energy...

224
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,820
And I became brighter
due to the synergy.

225
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,310
[1Minute is now turning
into a real team]

226
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:32,370
We prepared 1Minute in a way as if
they'll appear on a music program.

227
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,170
We put the most effort
into this team.

228
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,000
[He carefully checks their
singing and choreography]

229
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,250
[YG tries to instill
his agency's colors]

230
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,470
As we practiced for the
2 weeks we were there...

231
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,780
I thought, "Am I really at YGE?"
because we might never go back.

232
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,120
- On the last day of practice...
- We kissed the wall.

233
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,040
We kissed the wall and
left our lip prints.

234
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,520
- Saying, "We'll return."
- That's right.

235
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,450
[How will the performance by
these 3 desperate girls be?]

236
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,380
[Ain't No Other Man - Christina Aguilera]

237
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,600

different from the original]

moves are filled with groove]

with confidence!]

[1Minute's performance
makes them smile]

243

[What are the judges' commentaries?]

246
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:43,360
I felt something amazing as
I watched your performance.

247
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,810
And that is...

248
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:51,620
I only heard your singing before,
but now I see the whole picture.

249
00:24:52,160 --> 00:25:00,120
Your clothes, the performance
on stage, and the dance moves...

250
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,770
I used to think it was something
to spice up your singing...

251
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:11,100
But the entire stage is as
important as the singing.

252
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:19,640
I now see the overall picture and was
amazed at how refined you became.

253
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,580
You're like pros now.

254
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:33,090
Now I see that YG doesn't make
people stand out for no reason.

255
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:39,270
That's how well you absorbed it
so I was pleased with the performance.

256
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,940
[How will his compliment affect
their decision on the TOP10?]

257
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:50,570
If judges can get enteritis from being nervous,
the contestants would be really nervous.

258
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:56,910
I have to take that into consideration.
You must have been nervous and burdened.

259
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,480
And... the good thing...

260
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,880
Yoon-kyung's voice was open
and had a full sound.

261
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,780
I thought of wanting to hear her
sing alone from beginning to end.

262
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:28,860
We're sensitive in saying good or bad things
to those that came to one's own agency.

263
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,970
Complimenting seems like
we're defending them...

264
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,750
And we feel they'll be eliminated
if we point things out.

265
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,040
This is really hard.

266
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,210
It is.

267
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll quote You Hee-yeol.

[In the case of their performance
as 2Minute with Jang Hanna]

270
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:57,560
You were like amateurs
but natural.

271
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,860
Today, you were like pros
but not as natural as before.

272

even though he trained them]

to the TOP10?]

[He's more nervous than her]

281
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,610
You went to Anttenna Music.
I meant Antenna Music.

282
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,610
Did you practice in the
new practice room?

283
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,930
Yes.

284
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,480
Please tell us one good and
bad thing about Antenna Music.

285
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,850
The good thing is that the
practice room was very cozy...

- He doesn't give food, right?

288
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,640
Uhh... kimbap.

289
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:22,110
Then the bad thing is
that you ate kimbap?

290
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,330
[It was good]

291
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,740
That was some good kimbap
I even bought you sikhye.

292

She's singing a song
that I really like.

293
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,860
It's Taeyang's "I Need a Girl."

294
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,680
She received a lot of compliments
for singing JYP's songs.

295
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:52,570
We're going to show that she can
also sing our rival YG's songs.

296
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,820
After she completes that, she'll sing
Antenna Music's songs in the end.

She has a clean, beautiful timbre,

She has groove and a
good sense of rhythm.

I never imagined I would
make it this far...

I thought I would never
even make it to Round 1.

Since You Hee-yeol and the others
said I'm doing really great...

I have to do well to be able

[Her own color and sensibility
stood out on this stage!]

It's my first time seeing that.

336
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,700
She mustered up the
courage to do that.

337
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,760
It's like a shy person shouting,
"I love you" in a loud voice.

338
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,280
Wow. I didn't know she had
such a side. It was new.

339
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,550
I think I can focus and look
forward to her in the future.

340
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,650
- Good job.
- Thank you.

341
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,620
[What is JYP's commentary?]

342
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,740
The first thing I felt...

343
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,710
You know how to sing sad songs
but not happy songs.

344
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,190
[Her emotions don't go well
with happy songs?]

345
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:31,640
"I Have a Girl" and "Bad Guy"
are heartbreaking, sad songs.

346
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,510
How you pushed out the sounds
went well with such songs.

347
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,110
You have to sing in staccato,
playfully, and bend it...

348
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,930
But the lyrics and the song
didn't go together at all.

349
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,130
That was the biggest problem.

350
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,870
Your interpretation of the lyrics
was what was great all this time.

351
00:35:54,870 --> 00:36:02,410
On the other hand, what was amazingly
good was when you sang the high notes.

352
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,630
You sang the high notes with
perfect vocalization.

353
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:11,360
Another thing is when you played
the guitar in 24th notes.

354
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,020
That's hard for high school girls, especially
women, since they lack finger strength.

355
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,630
I was amazed at how you
played it almost perfectly.

356
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,760
You did well.

357
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,010
[JYP pointed things out and
also complimented her]

358
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,270
[Mixed feelings...]

359
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,670
Our commentaries are brutal
and cold-hearted, right?

360
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:40,220
We don't care what others think.
We just say what we feel.

361
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,970
It feels like I'm being scolded.

362
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:44,900
That's how you feel in
the battle audition.

363
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,750
I almost grabbed his neck.

364
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,740
[The sorrow of being
a rookie judge...]

365
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,890
That's how sensitive this
battle audition is.

366
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,620
As I trained with Jin-ah
for the past 3 weeks...

367
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:08,020
I used to have interest because you
played the guitar and interpreted well.

368
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:13,530
The most amazing thing during those weeks
is that I started seeing her as a vocalist.

369
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:25,950
Her timbre, vocal range, high notes,
bending, and others aren't like anyone.

370
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:34,060
I was mesmerized by your charm
every time I listened to you.

371
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:41,520
I was very happy to have heard
that during those weeks.

372
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,660
I wanted to compliment and tell you that.
Looks like I get that chance today.

373
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,850
- Good job.
- Thank you.

374

[Discussion is over]

380
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,470
All three teams did well.

381
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:47,210
All of you must have been
nervous for going first.

382
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,450
Now it's the decisive moment.

383
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,700
This is the first group
of the battle audition.

384
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:59,300
1st place was picked unanimously.

385

[Nam Young-joo who gave
her all in the high notes]

386

high notes and new charm]

389

It's Kwon Jin-ah. Congratulations
on advancing to the TOP10.

390

[Congratulations]

391
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,870
Now I'm actually doing what
I only watched on television.

392
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,810
I'm surprised but also
look forward to it.

393
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm also worried.

394
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,870
[She's still dazed]

395

[Time to announce
2nd and 3rd place]

396
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:09,140
As you all know, 3rd place is
automatically eliminated.

397
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,600
2nd place gets another chance.

398
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:26,480
Since we trained you for a long time,
affection and pity crosses our mind.

399
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,470
This is really hard.

400
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,510
It is hard.

401
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,500
Alright.

We'll announce 2nd place.

403

Both teams didn't do well
compared to last round.

potential as a singer and strengths.

[YG's 1Minute is eliminated]

410
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:44,850
1Minute had a member change and showed
a performance you never did before.

411
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:47,540
You had to think of many things.

412
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:56,810
I think you were nervous today but
you will have future opportunities.

413
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:02,050
I would like to say something
since I trained them.

414
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:06,100
1Minute did well. I don't
think you were nervous.

415
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:13,980
You didn't make big mistakes
and was the most confident.

416
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:26,280
I feel sorry because I think the
member change produced this result.

417
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,010
But it was every bit as good when
compared to 2Minute so cheer up.

418

We can meet again when
the opportunity arises.

419

You did well to make it
this far, right?

420
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:50,360
During my 2-3 months stay in Korea,
I got to see my grandmother...

421

I never studied music or did any of
these things before so it was fun.

422

I'm grateful to have made it
all the way to TOP18...

423
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:11,490
Don't say TOP18. If someone asks,
tell them you went to TOP11, okay?

424
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:16,040
I truly think you are TOP11.

425

I thank you for this opportunity
I had never imagined.

426

428

low self-esteem...

Jung-hee is, "What is her color?"

the most for her.

501
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:31,770
[He carefully pats her so that
she won't lose confidence...]

502
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,900
[But the next day]

503
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,940
[She cries during practice]

504
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:51,630
A singer has to have a unique
voice or move the people.

505
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,470
But I don't have that.

506
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,870
All I have are techniques...

507
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,880
[She slowly lost self-esteem
due to worrying a long time]

508
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,400
This won't do.

509
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,450
If drastic measures aren't taken,
she will get eliminated.

510
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,030
[The drastic measures he took...]

511
00:50:12,030 --> 00:50:17,470
I worried over this for several days.
This is just my suggestion to you.

512
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:24,750
I thought of you attempting
what you are best at.

513
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,080
Do you know Choi Baek-ho's
"Regarding Romantic"?

514
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,960
- No.
- Not at all?

515
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,790
[This song came out in 1995
before she was even born]

516
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:41,700
[It's an adult contemporary
contemplating on life]

517
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,660
[She listens to the song]

518
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,080
[What does she think?]

519
00:50:54,810 --> 00:51:00,570
I might sing in a teuroteu style
since this is an old song.

520
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,840
The song is great but I thought,
"What should I do?"

521
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:08,440
What do you think?

522
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,060
It's good but...

523
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,620
I might sing in a
teuroteu style.

524
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,340
- Without realizing it?
- Yes.

525
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,880
I'm not telling you to
sing in a teuroteu style.

526
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:26,600
I thought of people's reaction
if you sing this like a ballad.

527
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:29,800
I would be surprised as a judge.

528
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,190
"I'm Hong Jung-hee.
Only I can do this."

529
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:38,350
I think showing such a performance
would be our strongest hand.

530
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:40,760
Great!

531
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,920
- Right?
- Yes.

532
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,330
After giving it some thought,
the moment she said yes...

533
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:50,300
That's when the burden
became bigger for me.

534
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,330
[Her bold challenge begins]

535
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,280
It's much more overwhelming
compared to before.

536
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,360
There's this power
that pulls us in.

537
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:14,970
He was more like a father
than a judge to me.

538
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,780
I was grateful.

539
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:22,200
She has to do well
and fight well.

540
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:28,500
All the hardships, sorrow, and
pain she went through...

541
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,630
This will be the moment when
she will run into all of that.

542
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:37,950
The weight is on both
of our shoulders.

543
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:43,440
[Will their challenge end
with a happy ending?]

544
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,450
Her clothes and the song
go well perfectly.

545
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:53,100
I have to tell you in advance
regarding this person.

546
00:52:53,100 --> 00:53:00,970
You see her with the instrument?
It's called a bandoneon used in tango.

547
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:12,810
Helping out is Koh Sang-ji
who specializes in tango music.

548
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,790
Are you ready,
Hong Jung-hee?

549
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:19,110
Yes.

550
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,190
Break a leg!

551
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,910
[Her mother watches from
the monitoring room]

552
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:30,160
[She was used to be known
as a teuroteu prodigy]

553
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,200
[She takes courage in attempting
a genre she's familiar with]

554
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,150
[What will be the result?]

555
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,540
[Regarding Romantic - Choi Baek-ho]

556
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,490
[She closes her eyes gently
and immerses in the music...]

557
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:33,290
[The bandoneon echoes sadly]

558
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:38,440
[It's as if she left her
body to the music]

559
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:08,130
Thank you.

560
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,470
[He smiles brightly as
soon as she's done]

561
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:18,840
[But]

562
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,510
[They look serious!]

563
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,780
[Did her performance
not move them?]

564
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,600
[It's not easy to speak]

565
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:37,560
This is hard.

566
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:49,190
You were known as a
teuroteu prodigy, right?

567
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,470
Just as You Hee-yeol said...

568
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,550
This is a sink or swim.

569
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,000
He took a risk because...

570
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,110
I think he wanted to encourage her
to do what she does best.

571
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:08,240
Choi Baek-ho's
"Regarding Romantic"...

572
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,720
During my three years on KPOP STAR,
it's the first time such a song was chosen.

573
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,040
I never judged this before...

574
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,140
[Will it be a harsh criticism?]

575
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:27,120
This song might not go
together with KPOP STAR.

576
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,840
But...

577
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,940
If this was a dice
she can roll only once...

578
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,610
I think she swam.

579
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,920
[A positive commentary
for her bold attempt!]

580
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:06,600
You wore clothes that really
went well with this song.

581
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:14,710
Your gestures and look... I saw a new side
to you and how well you sing these songs.

582
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,880
It's my first time seeing
such a performance.

583
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,340
It was interesting
and I enjoyed it.

584
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,370
- Good job.
- Thank you.

585
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,810
[She finally receives a
compliment from YG]

586
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:32,700
[Next is JYP!]

587

[Sigh]

588
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,700
[What's the meaning of his sigh?]

589
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:49,420
There are two people that break my
heart this season on KPOP STAR.

590
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,730
One is Heo Eun-yul and
the other is Jung-hee.

591
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:57,470
[What breaks JYP's heart?]

592
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,730
I don't know but when
I look into her eyes...

593
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:03,930
It breaks my heart.

594
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:12,280
The things that made me sad for Eun-yul
became brighter and disappeared.

595
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,270
But it's deepening for
Jung-hee each round.

596
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,110
It drives me crazy when
I look into her eyes.

597
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:31,880
"What song am I supposed to sing?"
You're still troubled by that.

598
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:35,660
[It's as if he saw
deep into her heart]

599
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:39,640
It felt like, "Okay, I'll sing
this song as best as possible."

600
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,090
[We can feel that they want
to help her in some way...]

601

Jung-hee...

602
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:52,490
The conclusion...

603
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:56,730
Your emotions have to come first.

604
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:06,090
It's not about what genre to sing.
First find what song moves you.

605
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:17,860
What song makes your heart to explode
when you listen to and sing?

606
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,350

[What will he say?]

610
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:45,460
I cried as I watched because...

611
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,010
It's not due to the times we spent but
the fact that I know what you went through.

612
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:59,710
You were known as a teuroteu
prodigy since you were young.

613
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,950
That broke your heart.

614
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:07,390
You came on KPOP STAR
with a different genre.

615
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:14,710
But you had to meet me, of all people,
and decide on Choi Baek-ho's song.

616
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:19,750
I'm watching you from a different
angle than the other two judges.

617
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:25,760
When we think of KPOP STAR,
the music is trendy and young.

618
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,310
That's how all the contents were.

619
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,330

620
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:35,850
No one can sing this
song better than you.

621
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:40,260
Compared to acting, you were
the best child actress...

622
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,140
And has considerable effort
compared to others.

623
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,730
It's as if you experienced
more than the judges here.

624
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:52,600
Despite the fact that you could
have sung this in a teuroteu style...

625
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:59,240
You controlled yourself and all of
these things moved me to tears.

626
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,030

with applause.

I didn't want her to take on a new
challenge since she's from abroad.

637
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,650
I gave serious thought on what
song she could sing the best.

638
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:15,610
I thought she could sing
this song passionately.

639
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,750
So she focused only on
this song and practiced.

669
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:29,320
[She broke through her limits!]

670
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:34,730
Vocalization and feel...

671
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:38,560
Ad-libs aren't something
that can be taught.

672
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,640
But there were a couple
I didn't imagine.

673
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:46,410
I loved the high notes.

674
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:57,990
It felt like all my worries
were blown away.

675
01:09:57,990 --> 01:10:03,470
It was a great chemical reaction
between YG and Bae Min-ah.

676
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:08,540
It was great.
I really enjoyed it.

677
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,590
[The others are getting
more uneasy]

678
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,250
[What is YG's commentary?]

679
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:30,810
It was better than I thought.

680
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:36,130
Usually, people are worse on
stage than during practice.

681
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:41,270
She changed a couple of the lines
from last time I checked.

682
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,110
I don't know if you remember
but I asked for two things.

683
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:52,460
"Love" is the point so just sing it.
Don't put in any unnecessary ad-libs.

684
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:57,380
And put in your own R&B ad-lib
in the latter part of the song.

685
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:00,410
I love this arrangement.

686
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:04,010
[She interpreted it with her soul
different from the original!]

687
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:12,630
I like your version the best
out of all the versions I heard.

688
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:16,820
It was new. I didn't know you
could sing it like that.

689
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:24,000
There's Hong Jung-hee's extreme emotion
and Bae Min-ah's completely different one.

690
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,600
I saw two different sides.

691
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:31,490
It was the best out of all
your performances.

692
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:34,480
- Good job.
- Thank you.

693
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:40,740
[They're getting more pressure]

694
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:46,480
The two contestants were complimented
and Almeng is the last contestant.

695
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,600
They were complimented every round.
Almeng, please get ready.

696
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:01,170
Usually, when those in front do well,
those in back get afraid and can't do it.

697
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:06,780
But I think Almeng will do better
if those in front did well.

698
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,270
A real superstar has to...

699
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:14,970
Hit a homer at the bottom of the 9th
with 2 outs, 2 strikes, and 3 balls.

700
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,610
When you're nervous and burdened.

701
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,420
Burden is written over his face.

702
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:24,900
[First time seeing Almeng tense]

703
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,890
How's your condition?

704
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:31,040
I'm at my worst.

705
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:37,360
My throat is in panic.
It doesn't feel like mine.

706
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,450
I went to the hospital
this morning.

707
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:46,630
I was told that there's a tear in the
mucous membrane of my vocal cords.

708
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,920
Maybe that's why it hurt. It hurt
yesterday when I was breathing.

709
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,090
[A week before the
battle audition]

710
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:58,040
[She has to sing the extreme high notes
with her throat in its worst condition]

711
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,100
I can't sing in falsetto.

712
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,790
- It sounds bad.
- It is.

713
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:05,110
[The morning of the
battle audition]

714
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:09,780
[She couldn't finish the
rehearsal due to the pain!]

715
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:12,800
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Yeah...

716
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:15,560
[She couldn't speak properly
until she got on stage]

717
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,350
I don't know if
we can do it.

718
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,020
[A desperately dangerous situation
with the TOP10 prematch ahead!]

719
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:29,160
The things we experienced in our
brief preparation as singers...

720
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:33,710
We were also pointed out
for our appearances.

721
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:38,330
It started since high school
and it's still ongoing.

722
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:43,840
Despite the good ratings I received,
it never went well in the end.

723
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,640
I wasn't told directly maybe
because I was a woman...

724
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:52,610
But beating around the bush made me
feel bad since I know what it's about.

725
01:13:52,610 --> 01:14:00,270
I was hurt when I was young
but it hurt my mother more.

726

[JYP training four days
before the battle audition]

727
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:07,930
Every word of the lyrics are great.

728
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:12,410
You'll win whoever you're up against
if only the lyrics get conveyed.

729
01:14:15,230 --> 01:14:21,250
Different from the previous rounds
where we just made it fun...

730
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:28,040
This time we want to say,
"Listen to our story."

731
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:35,750
God is so cruel. I don't know why
my throat is in such a condition.

732
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:43,120
I hope you'll listen without missing
a single word of the lyrics.

733

[They prepared more earnestly
for this performance]

finish the entire song?]

[Ugly - 2NE1]

737
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:19,360
I start singing but
No one listens to me

738

I am not pretty
I am not beautiful

739
01:15:32,360 --> 01:15:35,340
You sing well but
You don't fit this concept

740
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,530
It's not that you're bad
Being a member doesn't suit you

741
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:41,580
What must be the problem?
When I withdrew myself

742
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,970

You have to be prettier

743

Artists have to be pretty

744
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,370

Were always NO, you know

745

To be singing

746

Prettier than required

747
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:06,740

Why tell me my looks aren't enough?

748
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:11,730
This lilting voice can only come
From a gorilla-looking face

749
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:15,070
That's right
Hear my instrument

750
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:20,710
Don't approach me
I hate such attention

751
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:26,560
You'll want to use me
And train me

752

753
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:34,590
You think I'm ugly?
This melody will change that

754
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:40,030
I'm here so listen to my voice
You still think that way?

755
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,740
Don't say to my face
Cause we're artists

756
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:49,180
You think I'm ugly?
My face makes an impact on stage

757
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:54,410
I'll fly great and far
Watch me to the end

758
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:58,410
So don't talk like that
Cause we're artists

759
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:18,060
You think I'm ugly?
My face makes an impact on stage

760

I'll fly great and far
Watch me to the end

So don't talk like that
Cause we're artists

762
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:31,340
You say "God is fair" but
It's unfair when you see us

763

Those thoughts make you live
Every day in this unfair world

Do I still look ugly?

767
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:06,260
Yup!

[They lavish them with applause for
displaying their fighting spirit]

01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:31,180
[Can't tell what they're thinking...]

770
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:43,640
I'll be frank.

771
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:48,540
This performance wasn't fun
like your other performances.

772
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:52,510
[It wasn't fun?]

773
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:04,300
But I was amazed as
I saw the lyrics.

774
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:11,310
The lyrics are well written.

775
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:17,340
What I mean by that is...

776
01:19:17,340 --> 01:19:23,670
What JYP talked of the most
this season is sincerity.

777
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:27,070
You were telling your story
and not someone else's.

778
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:31,900
In this song "Ugly," you said
if you had to be pretty to sing.

779
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:35,230
Writing lyrics is as hard as
writing the music.

780
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:39,470
You can take out good words from
a book and add them to it.

781
01:19:39,470 --> 01:19:42,150
But that's not important.
Is this person telling his/her story?

782
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:44,950
It's about how well one can
express those sad emotions.

783
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:50,710
Just as JYP always said,
your story was in it.

784
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:57,160
I was amazed at
Almeng's talents again.

785

[She cries silently]

786
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,410

01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,250
I don't know...

788
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:22,610
A lot must be on your mind
like how hard it was...

789
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:27,620
[So many emotions went through her
as she thought of the hard times]

790
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,780
Alright!

791
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,200
Let's stop the tears.

792
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:41,890
As I listened to this song,
you asked a question at the end.

793
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:45,880
"Do I still look ugly?"
Not at all.

794
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,350
You're the prettiest
and the coolest.

795
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:53,510
I wanted to say that first since
you asked the question.

796
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:03,830
This is the best song out of all
that you have shown here.

797
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:09,160
The reason is...

798
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:14,300
You did a lot of songs that were
like a musical filled with ideas.

799
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:16,480
But this song didn't
have much of that.

800
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:23,300
I get surprised with the other songs
when I see them for the first time.

801
01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,230
But I didn't want to
listen to it again.

802
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:29,060
Yet I want to listen
to this again.

803
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:39,210
You can add this song if
you produce an album.

804
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:46,520
It's like you're taking your
first step with this song.

805
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:49,710
[They can add this song to their
first album with confidence!]

806
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:59,910
I was especially moved
even more because...

807
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:04,180
Even if I was a part of this group,
the lyrics would still work out.

808
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,020
[JYP failed innumerable
auditions in the past]

809
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,470
Did you write this?

810
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,550
I even thought, "How did
they know my past?"

811
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,190
It's like this.

812
01:22:15,190 --> 01:22:20,330
You couldn't sing the first verse
well due to the inflammation.

813
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:25,570
But you kept on singing the
high notes and didn't avoid it.

814
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,830
And it opened in the end.

815
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:40,910
[She finally overcame it!]

816
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:47,080
I think that's how
Almeng's life will be.

817
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:52,070
You hit a wall, but you keep
at it and it opens in the end.

818
01:22:53,300 --> 01:23:02,720
When you sang the high notes at the end,
it worked because you didn't avoid it.

819
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:07,250
It was a great performance.

820
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:13,320
And I would like you to continue
and put on the best performance.

821
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,580
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

822
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,490
I want to know
why you are crying.

823
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:22,580
Choi Rin, tell us
why you are crying.

824
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:27,090
[She kept on crying during
the commentaries]

825
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:34,510
- Since I couldn't sing...
- Because your throat hurt.

826
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:38,840
When I sang the high notes...

827
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:43,040
[Her throat was in its worst condition.
"Maybe this is as far as I go..."]

828
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:51,470
Because it didn't come out...
I screamed my lungs out.

829
01:23:51,470 --> 01:23:55,280
You sang it well. Right?
It came out well in the end.

830
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,900
She's upset.

831
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:02,140
That's when I felt like crying.

832
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:14,610
It's fortunate you got good results
despite your bad condition.

833
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,320
- You did great.
- Thank you.

834
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:35,480
[They now discuss to choose
who makes it to the TOP10!]

835
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:37,880
Will the other two join
them on stage?

836
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,940
This is really...

837
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,630
It's as we expected.

838
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:45,480
[It's hard to choose
who was better!]

839
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:56,130
Since they all have different
colors, this is really...

840
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:07,640
Let's make this simple.
Who is first among them?

841
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:09,160
This is hard...

842
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,240
It's a shame because
this one did better.

843
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:29,960
[The discussion gets longer]

844
01:25:31,470 --> 01:25:34,840
[They give much thought
since the battle was fierce]

845
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,630
[Discussion is finally over]

846
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:49,300
[What is the result of
the long discussion?]

847
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:13,290
It was hard for us because all
three turned things around.

848
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:18,630
First, we expected an exciting
performance from Almeng...

849
01:26:18,630 --> 01:26:23,940
But they shocked us
with a serious song.

850
01:26:23,940 --> 01:26:31,270
We wondered if Bae Min-ah could go
to the next level as a singer.

851
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:35,040
But she showed us how she
took that leap overnight.

852
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:44,870
And we knew Jung-hee sang well
but not to this extent.

853
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:53,580
We really want all
three to pass.

854
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:03,020
But we have to rank you.

855
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:14,320
We'll announce the first place
we decided in our discussion.

856
01:27:25,950 --> 01:27:28,220
The TOP10 finalist is...

857
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:44,280
It's Almeng.

858
01:27:44,280 --> 01:27:45,180
Congratulations.

859
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:52,050
It's Almeng.
Congratulations.

860
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:08,020
What we never imagined
just happened.

861
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:13,200
I don't think it hit me yet.

862
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:18,120
I'm really happy but because
I was crying before...

863
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,110
I never imagined we'd
make it this far.

864
01:28:25,490 --> 01:28:27,870
[Time to announce
who's eliminated]

865
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:35,760
The one that takes 2nd
will have a rematch.

866
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:43,940
The one that takes 3rd is
unfortunately eliminated.

867
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:54,470
[The judges know the result]

868
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:59,840
Since both of you went through
a lot to make it this far...

869
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:03,920
It's hard for us to
let one of you go.

870
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:12,990
3rd place is...

871
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:16,570
[Announcement for 3rd place!]

872
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:30,830
[Who will be eliminated?]

873
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:39,570
Hong Jung-hee.

874
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,660
[Hong Jung-hee is eliminated]

875
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:49,450
[Her mother confirmed
her elimination]

876
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:52,210
[She tries to remain calm]

877
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,180
You did great.
You really did.

878
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:06,340
Your wanderings...

879
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:11,020
How you feel lost...

880
01:30:11,020 --> 01:30:18,670
We feel it because all three of us
worried about that once in our life.

881
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:26,560
"What music should I do?"
We all have that worry.

882
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:33,710
You didn't say much about it, but
your worries were conveyed to us.

883
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:40,700
You would have made it to the TOP10
if you were not in this group.

884
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,110
Thank you.

885
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:53,320
I think You Hee-yeol would
have something to say.

886
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:46,140
[He can't bear to see her
with tears on his face]

887
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:07,810
Jung-hee, you really did well.
It might be weird to say this...

888
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:12,260
But I think you should cheer Hee-yeol
and not the other way around.

889
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,500
I'll come on your show.

890
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,720
You did well.
You really did.

891
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:34,850
I really like your attitude
and the way you sing.

892
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:37,950
I'm the one who actually learned
a lot during those 3 weeks.

893
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:44,420
In the future, whether you're on
another stage or a recording studio...

894
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:50,380
Just as we practiced, you will
be singing along a piano...

895
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:52,940
I'll be playing the piano
when that time comes.

896
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:56,100
Promise to meet again.

897
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,770
Thank you.

898
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,070
Good job.

899
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:15,500
[Seeing her for the last time...]

900
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:19,930
Let's take a break.

901
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:39,020
[She tried to hold it in...]

902
01:33:54,040 --> 01:34:02,170
You Hee-yeol treated me more like
a daughter than a student.

903
01:34:02,170 --> 01:34:05,340
We became close the
past 3 weeks.

904
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:11,950
Just as he said, I'll be a
great artist somewhere.

905
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:17,860
I would like to see him
again on stage.

906
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,580
You did great, my daughter.

907
01:34:27,825 --> 01:34:41,225

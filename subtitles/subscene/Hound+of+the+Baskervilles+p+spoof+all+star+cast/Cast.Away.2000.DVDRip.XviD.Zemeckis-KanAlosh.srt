01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:17,500
<i>She's...</i>

690
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:22,500
<i>She's... sort of lost.</i>

691
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,300
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

692
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,200
Anyway, uh,

693
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:37,200
I'm sorry that...

694
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:09,200
[Inaudible]

695
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,600
Okay, people, let's go.

696
01:53:36,700 --> 01:53:38,900
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

697
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:41,500
<i>[Maynard] You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.</i>

698
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:44,200
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

699
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,300
- I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- I know.

700
01:53:46,500 --> 01:53:48,300
With the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

701
01:53:48,500 --> 01:53:50,800
I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

702
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:55,100
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

703
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:58,900
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

704
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:00,900
Take care.

705
01:54:03,700 --> 01:54:06,000
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,500
You got everything
you need? Okay.

707
01:54:11,700 --> 01:54:13,500
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,

708
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,900
and I'll see you
in the morning.

709
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:18,700
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

710
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:21,300
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

711
01:54:23,100 --> 01:54:26,200
<i>- Bring you back to life, man.
- [Becca] Bye, Chuck.</i>

712
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,500
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

713
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:30,800
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

714
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,600
How long are you
gonna be, man?

715
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,900
Well...

716
01:56:23,100 --> 01:56:26,000
- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

717
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,300
I'm awake.

718
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,500
I saw your taxi drive up.

719
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:58,900
Get in here
out of the rain.

720
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,300
I saw you
down at the hub today,

721
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:10,600
so I know you were down there.

722
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:30,900
Let me get you a towel.

723
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:44,800
They're sleeping.

724
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,700
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

725
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,200
It's a nice house.

726
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,100
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

727
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,600
What's your daughter's name?

728
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,200
<i>Katie.</i>

729
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:23,300
Katie.

730
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,700
<i>- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.</i>

731
01:58:44,100 --> 01:58:46,000
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

732
01:58:56,100 --> 01:58:59,100
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

733
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:04,600
[Sighs, Chuckles]

734
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:09,700
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

735
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,900
<i>First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.</i>

736
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:16,700
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

737
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,800
Yeah.

738
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,800
But that's not all.

739
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,800
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

740
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,500
<i>- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.</i>

741
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:30,000
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

742
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:35,900
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

743
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,200
<i>I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.</i>

744
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:41,500
That'll do fine.

745
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,700
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

746
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:02,400
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

747
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:08,100
When you, um...

748
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:11,100
When your plane went down,

749
02:00:11,300 --> 02:00:13,500
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

750
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,700
I think about
taking it up again, though.

751
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:32,900
I came out here
to give you this.

752
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:36,500
Oh, my God.

753
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:40,500
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

754
02:00:42,200 --> 02:00:44,800
And I, uh,
I kept the picture.

755
02:00:46,300 --> 02:00:48,200
It was all faded anyway.

756
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:52,300
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

757
02:00:52,500 --> 02:00:55,400
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

758
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:08,300
<i>That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.</i>

759
02:01:10,700 --> 02:01:13,000
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

760
02:01:13,300 --> 02:01:16,700
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

761
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:23,400
So here's where
that ship found you.

762
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:27,900
You drifted about 500 miles.

763
02:01:28,100 --> 02:01:30,200
This is where
your island was,

764
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:33,600
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

765
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,400
And these are
the search grids.

766
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:40,400
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

767
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,600
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

768
02:01:54,100 --> 02:01:56,400
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

769
02:02:00,300 --> 02:02:02,100
I wanna show you something.

770
02:02:04,400 --> 02:02:06,200
Come here.

771
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,800
This is...
This is our car.

772
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:22,100
You kept our car.

773
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:27,500
All right, now,
this is weird.

774
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:38,200
It's a good car.

775
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:40,600
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

776
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:43,300
Two very nice memories.

777
02:02:43,500 --> 02:02:45,400
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

778
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:50,000
So, can I drive it?

779
02:02:50,200 --> 02:02:52,000
It's your car.

780
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:02,900
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

781
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,300
Um...

782
02:03:11,500 --> 02:03:13,300
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

783
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:38,200
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

784
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:40,200
I don't know.

785
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:43,100
It's kind of confusing
right now.

786
02:03:43,300 --> 02:03:45,900
Well, you should.

787
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:48,100
I mean, really,
you should.

788
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:52,300
I would.

789
02:03:54,600 --> 02:03:56,500
So, what now?

790
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,500
I don't know.

791
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:05,900
I really don't know.

792
02:04:14,400 --> 02:04:16,200
[Starts Engine]

793
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,500
You said
you'd be right back.

794
02:04:25,800 --> 02:04:27,700
I'm so sorry.

795
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:31,500
Me too.

796
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,400
Chuck!

797
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:49,000
Chuck!

798
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,000
Chuck!

799
02:06:08,400 --> 02:06:10,200
I always knew you were alive.

800
02:06:10,400 --> 02:06:12,900
I knew it.

801
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,200
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

802
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,300
that I had to let you go.

803
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:21,600
I love you.

804
02:06:21,800 --> 02:06:23,500
You're the love of my life.

805
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:28,000
I love you too, Kelly.

806
02:06:29,800 --> 02:06:31,600
More than you'll ever know.

807
02:07:32,600 --> 02:07:34,400
Chuck?

808
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:44,200
You have to go home.

809
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:34,600
We both had done
the math, and...

810
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:39,400
Kelly added it all up.

811
02:08:41,100 --> 02:08:42,900
She knew she had
to let me go.

812
02:08:43,100 --> 02:08:47,300
I added it up,
knew that I'd...

813
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:49,400
I'd lost her.

814
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,500
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

815
02:08:56,700 --> 02:08:59,100
I was gonna die there,

816
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,200
totally alone.

817
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:10,400
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

818
02:09:14,600 --> 02:09:16,500
The only choice I had,

819
02:09:19,300 --> 02:09:21,400
the only thing
I could control...

820
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:27,000
was when and how...

821
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:29,000
and where
that was gonna happen.

822
02:09:29,200 --> 02:09:33,500
So... I made a rope.

823
02:09:36,800 --> 02:09:39,500
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

824
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:45,200
But I had to test it,
you know?

825
02:09:45,500 --> 02:09:48,200
Of course.
You know me.

826
02:09:50,300 --> 02:09:52,100
And the weight of the log...

827
02:09:52,300 --> 02:09:55,500
snapped the limb
of the tree.

828
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,500
So l-l...

829
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:00,200
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

830
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:03,200
I had power over nothing.

831
02:10:11,900 --> 02:10:15,300
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

832
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:21,400
I knew...

833
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:23,800
somehow...

834
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,200
that I had to stay alive.

835
02:10:27,900 --> 02:10:29,700
Somehow.

836
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:33,000
I had to keep breathing,

837
02:10:35,700 --> 02:10:37,700
even though there was
no reason to hope.

838
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,500
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

839
02:10:48,600 --> 02:10:51,200
So that's what I did.

840
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,800
I stayed alive.

841
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,900
I kept breathing.

842
02:10:58,200 --> 02:11:00,400
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

843
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,400
because the tide...

844
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,900
came in,
gave me a sail.

845
02:11:11,800 --> 02:11:13,600
And now, here I am.

846
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:19,900
I'm back...

847
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:22,600
in Memphis, talking to you.

848
02:11:24,700 --> 02:11:27,100
I have ice in my glass.

849
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:36,200
And I've lost her
all over again.

850
02:11:44,100 --> 02:11:46,400
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

851
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:54,900
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

852
02:12:02,300 --> 02:12:04,300
And I know
what I have to do now.

853
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,300
I gotta keep breathing.

854
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,400
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

855
02:12:15,700 --> 02:12:18,100
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

856
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:35,600
<i>[Elvis Presley]
#I gave a letter to the postman #</i>

857
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,800
<i>#He put it in his sack #</i>

858
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:42,600

Where are you headed?

The rematch is going
to be more tense.

12

It's unpredictable due to
all the strong competitors.

13

I became excited as I
came out on broadcast.

So a lot of my desire
came out in my singing.

I'm still unstable, but I don't
want to make those mistakes.

58

expectations after the 2 songs.

But your introduction didn't
meet our expectations.

would go along with us.

Brian, McKay, and myself

is very beautiful.

this beautiful.

You did good as a team
to deceive even me.

This is why a team
is important.

during that time.

with this beat.

Ye-dam and Min-suk went
beyond our expectations.

go beyond our expectations.

[TOP10 finalists are decided]

691
01:07:54,500 --> 01:08:00,010
We can't believe to
see you two there.

692
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:05,950
In the path of a singer,
all this process...

693
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:12,820
It's a shortcut or a long way
at times, but we all walk it.

694
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,460
For me, it was a
fun experience.

695
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:23,780
I'm in my 20s. I'll use
this as a steppingstone.

696
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:31,460
I think I'll be a great
singer in 4 years.

697
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,780
[Spreading a happy
virus to the end]

698
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:40,570
And Shin Ji-hoon?

699
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:52,760
I think many viewers liked your
innocence and jewel-like voice.

700
01:08:52,760 --> 01:09:00,540
Personally, it breaks my
heart to send you like this.

701
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:08,170
We need to be fair and
the viewers are watching.

702
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:17,340
I think you will be the most
frustrated and will cry at home.

703
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:26,240
When I first started
out on KPOP STAR...

704
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:32,700
I promised my mom
that I won't cry.

705
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,190
But I'm crying my
heart out today.

706
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:47,050
I was confident with
the last song.

707
01:09:47,050 --> 01:09:53,520
But I'm sorry for crying.

708
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:04,170
Other than skating,
I also liked singing.

709
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:06,740
I was grateful.

710
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,930
[Complimented for her voice
but shockingly eliminated]

711
01:10:13,930 --> 01:10:18,580
We don't know if you'll be
a singer or a figure skater.

712
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:24,040
But take this opportunity
to become stronger.

713
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:27,290
- Okay?
- Yes.

714
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:29,360
You did well.

715
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,650
Thank you.

716
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:37,670
[Frustration and shock]

717
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,830
[Two who shined on stage
with their talents leave]

718
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,660
[TOP10 finalists share
their joy in passing]

719
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,390
I thought I was going
to be eliminated.

720
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:53,450
Now it actually begins.

721
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,450
We're thankful because
we almost got eliminated.

722
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:00,520
But we got together and
made it to the TOP10.

723
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,650
It's like a dream.

724
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:07,350
We didn't expect
this at all.

725
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:10,560
Let's do it, alright?

726
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:15,520
One, two, three...
Let's do it!

727
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,950
They have to become professionals
since this is the live broadcast.

728
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:25,030
They are before the nation,
and mistakes are not allowed.

729
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,250
[The pressure of the live
broadcast is unlike before]

730
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:31,380
[A grand stage and
a huge audience!]

731
01:11:32,070 --> 01:11:34,530
[The TOP10 practice for
the first live broadcast]

732
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,420
[But one day]

733
01:11:47,290 --> 01:11:49,010
I have nothing to say.

734
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:53,890
I said to endure
and don't leave.

735
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:57,190
I thought she would
wait and not leave.

736
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:01,040
[Did something happen
to someone?]

737
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,290
I don't know.

738
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:09,750
I can't say
leave or stay.

739
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,120
That's what she wanted.

740
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,870
[One of them is withdrawing?]

741
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:20,020
[This contestant brought up
her intention many times]

742
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:22,200
[They came to the practice
room to persuade her]

743
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:26,700
[The one who
brought this up...]

744
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:32,320
[It's Kim Do-yeon!]

745
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,630
[What's her reason?]

746
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,830
She thinks she's
harming us...

747
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:46,190
Everyone else is
passionate...

748
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:56,370
She doesn't think
she's that passionate.

749
01:12:56,370 --> 01:13:02,630
So she feels sorry and
guilty for being here.

750
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:06,470
[She was close to Soo-jin and
told her concerns to only her]

751
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:09,260
[In the middle of practice]

752
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,900
[She spent most of her
time alone in her thoughts]

753
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,710
[She worried alone thinking
she would cause them trouble]

754
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,510
[A few days after
meeting her]

755
01:13:23,410 --> 01:13:26,610
[She heads to the broadcasting
office to reveal her intentions]

756
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,660
[What was her decision?]

757
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:39,720
I thought this over
again and again.

758
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:45,570
I had a different heart
compared to the others.

759
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:49,280
It doesn't mean I took
this lightly or as a joke.

760
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:57,520
I wanted to be a music
teacher instead of a singer.

761
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:05,100
I'm someone who sings, but
I wasn't confident in singing.

762
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,150
One reason for coming here
was to gain confidence.

763
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:16,660
I started thinking this would
be a good experience for me.

764
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:23,630
As I started getting good
results and advanced...

765
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,330
The pressure was big.

766
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:33,270
The others thought they will
be singers with this chance.

767
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:41,950
They were more desperate than me
but were eliminated one by one.

768
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:48,820
I felt sorry and that it wasn't
right for me to get good results.

769
01:14:55,530 --> 01:15:04,870
I did my best, but it was
mentally burdening.

770
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:17,000
I made this decision and
I shouldn't regret it.

771
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,780
I'm really sorry.

772
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:33,180
My parents were happy
because of me...

773
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:40,480
I feel like I'm letting
them down at the end.

774
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:49,120
I'm sorry.

775
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,860
[The production crew decided
to accept her decision]

776
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:56,040
[The day she parted
with her peers]

777
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,520
[Her parents came
to pick her up]

778
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:07,580
[Her mother is prouder than anyone
that she was on KPOP STAR]

779
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:11,760
[It's unfortunate, but she decides
to respect her daughter's wish]

780
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:18,420
I hope that...

781
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,690
They could understand
me even a little bit.

782
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:30,840
"That could happen."
"There are people like her."

783
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:36,240
[She left her
final message]

784
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:39,980
[We respect and
support her dreams]

[Judges' emergency meeting!]

786
01:16:44,330 --> 01:16:49,000
[The judges have an
emergency meeting]

787
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:53,090
We asked for
your opinions.

788
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:57,120
As we said earlier,
Do-yeon withdrew.

789
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,390
[It was expected, but
the shock was great!]

790
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:04,680
[Emergency meeting!]

791
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,020
She couldn't bear the burden.

792
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:13,450
We can't nurture the
dream she threw away.

793
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,880
The most important thing
is if they want to do it.

794
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:17,500
The heart is the
most important.

795
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:21,310
We broadcast it as is and
respect her decision.

796
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:22,620
What do we do?

797
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:27,350
We have to discuss if we
go through the list or not.

798
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:37,820
[Unforeseen occurence! What
about the last TOP10 seat?]

799
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,240
[Who will take the last seat?]

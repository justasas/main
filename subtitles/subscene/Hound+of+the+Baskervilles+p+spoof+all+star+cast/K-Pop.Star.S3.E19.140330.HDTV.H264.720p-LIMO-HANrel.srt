I'm grateful to those that rooted
for me even though I'm lacking.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,320
Being in the TOP6 or TOP8 isn't
important. I gained more things.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,880
I'm truly grateful for gaining
many things in music.

impartial judgment today.

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,950
Since last week was YG week, it seems
many of them are thinking about YG.

47
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,740
I heard you made efforts since this week
was JYP week. What did you do?

48
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,900
I didn't make any efforts but for them
to choose an agency correctly...

49
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,120
- I told them who YG really is.
- You told him who he is.

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,660
- He's different on and off the air.
- Were they affected by that?

51

They're aware now.

52

53

gets to choose from the 3 agencies.

the judges are also getting intense.

100

I practice vocalization, stretch, and
exercise. I do these three every day.

You know when he talks...

132
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,360
He talks and at the end,
for example...

133
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,570
"You're an amateur,
but you're like a singer."

134

[JYP, why you...]

141
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,310

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,360
It's dinnertime right now...

143
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,600
Anyways, I'm fine with
having Hee-yeol with us...

144
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,100
But YG has a problem because in
the past two years I was with him...

145
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:10,360
I was the cold, strict judge and...
YG was the kind, humane judge.

146
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,530
But we suddenly have someone
much kinder and more humane.

147
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,390
YG's image is now vague.
You know what I mean?

148
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,690
So it's important how
you set your image.

149
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,410
The funny thing when I watch
it later on television...

150
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,950
YG and I dance a lot.

151
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,680
He's one of the best dancers
in the history of Korea.

152
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,980
But...

153
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,760
When he does this, the beat is...

154
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,000
I wonder what that beat is.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,550
Is that a thirty-second note?

156
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,950
I'm also a dancer but
I don't know what that is.

157

[It looks right...]

[Maybe not...]

159
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,580
He can just get into the rhythm
but I don't know what he's doing.

160
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,520
I would understand if he didn't dance
but he was a legend in dancing.

161
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,930
It's so fun badmouthing them.

162
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,200
There are 3 shows left.

163
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:32,590
We were very nervous last week because
we saw you choose your desired agency.

164
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,490
But two of you don't
know how to choose.

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,850
Jina, you don't choose
an agency like this.

168
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:46,450
You have to think and consider your
color and many things, not like this.

169
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,540
Sam, it's because
you don't know YG.

170
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,900
Look at me. You and
this don't mix.

171
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,440
You don't go with this groove.

So I was "unnice" before
you saw me like this?

We gained a lot since he gave advice like
a senior artist and taught us like a teacher.

190

We ate together and
he fed me like a mother.

- I see that you're one up.

I want to diss him too.

JYP said that his goal was to
improve in singing every day.

212

us that expression? What is it?

about his voice.

and real-time voting by viewers 40%.

will advance to the semifinal.

will depart from KPOP STAR.

but no multiple votes for one contestant.

begin the actual competition.

with good resonance.

had that penetrating sound?

her to watch Shanice's performance.

340
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:47,810
She knew what I wanted and
opened her voice that much.

341
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:52,120
And that strong, sharp
voice did come out.

342
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,480
That's what's frightening.
Her performance was flawless.

343
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,520
I see.

344
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,960
JYP's score...

345
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,550
He said it was flawless.
What will be her score?

346
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,290
It's 99!

347
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:13,000
It's the highest ever!
99! A point short of 100.

348
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:21,130
But YG and You Hee-yeol have a
blank face. I wonder what they think.

349
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,040
Who will go first?

350
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,060
YG?

351
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:34,110
Out of JYP's many hit songs,
I don't really know this one.

352
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,890
Are you still sulking?

353
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:46,310
The most important thing for a
singer is not just singing well.

354
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:54,900
It's to convey the emotion and the lyrics...
the most important thing is to move us.

355
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:02,710
I felt that this song is too good
after watching your performance.

356
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,810
This would be a hit song if
it was sung by Kwon Jina.

357
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,880
- So it's an advantage for her.
- Let go of it already!

358
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,790
The song didn't meet its owner.

359
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:22,050
If Kwon Jina released this song now,
it would take No. 1 on the music charts.

360
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,340
YG's score...

361
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,750
What is YG's score after
giving such a commentary?

362
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,190
It's 95!

363
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,970
That's a high score,
and You Hee-yeol?

364
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:43,240
I was really worried that she was
singing this song because...

365
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,580
She sang JYP's songs several times.
Wouldn't this be overlapping?

366
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:55,800
Even I was concerned that maybe the viewers
might think she's only singing JYP's songs.

367
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,430
And second, this is a ballad.

368
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:05,830
I wondered if she could sing a ballad
since she sang songs with groove.

369
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:11,360
Many things will be revealed if she
goes head on with just singing.

370
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,360
But...

371
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,390
There are various singing styles
of many different singers.

372
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:29,240
Jina has a different color from the
current female ballad singers.

373
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,180
She has a new singing style, not old,
that this generation prefers.

374
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:39,250
She could become the greatest female
ballad singer. I thought, "Who is she?"

375
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,250
Antenna Music's score...

376
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:49,660
That was more of a compliment.
I'm curious of the score.

377
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,040
It's 98!

378
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,460
That's a very high score!
She finished with 292.

379
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:04,030
It hasn't been decided whether
you advance or not but...

380
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,260
How do you feel right now?
Did you expect this score?

381
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:14,960
I was really worried and didn't expect
such compliments. I'm really nervous.

382
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,390
Whose commentary was memorable?

383
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,470
- JYP.
- I see.

384
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:27,500
That was only 60%. The other
40% is from the viewers' votes.

385
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,880
Those cheering for Kwon Jina can
text "1" or "Kwon Jina" to #0606.

386
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,750
Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

387
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,280
This stage was by
No. 1 Kwon Jina!

388
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,240
[No. 2 Sam Kim]

389
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,490
I was born in the US and this is
my first time coming to Korea.

390
00:32:52,490 --> 00:33:00,130
I sang alone and was just
playing around on the guitar.

391
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:06,810
But now I have people
cheering me in Korea.

392
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:13,020
Who am I for them to
treat me so well?

393
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:17,070
I'm thankful but embarrassed.

394
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,560
[What is JYP's advice for Sam
who's making a frightening rise?]

395
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,450
Since Sam sings with his throat,
if I could just change his voice...

396
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,430
He could give off a
more powerful voice.

397
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,740
So I introduced him to R. Kelly
who sings with his body.

398

[R. Kelly - the textbook
on R&B vocalization]

399
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,260
You have to use your entire body.
Then you need to breathe from here.

400
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:47,950
JYP said I lack in fundamentals
and abdominal breathing.

401
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:55,230
I practice to not breathe with my chest
even when I'm not singing.

402
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,810
I'm paying attention
to it and practicing.

[JYP gets Sam's song choice]

404
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,390
He can utilize what he learned from
the private tutor in this song.

405
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,820
I'm getting excited.

406
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:18,760
[Ben E. King's "Stand by Me"]

407
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,800
It'll be amazing if he does it.
This song is possible for him.

408
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:30,340
I expect him to arrange this well.

409
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:35,970
It was hard at first because this
song doesn't have many lyrics.

410
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:43,740
I wrote some lyrics to show something new
since it repeats and could sound boring.

411

to come and cheer Sam]

415
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,370
- I really missed you guys.
- You were awesome.

416
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,630
- How's practice?
- It's hard.

417
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,590
- It should be hard.
- It really is.

418
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,170
Could you play a little?

419
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,910
- When I first...
- Oh! Dara?

420
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,040

[No. 2 Sam Kim]

454
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,440
This stage was by
No. 2 Sam Kim.

455
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,350
We could feel the soul from this
performance by the guitar genius.

456
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:58,860
Sam is feeling and
enjoying the mood here.

457
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,310
He even made gestures he doesn't
usually make. That was impressive.

458
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,360
Let's hear the commentaries.

459
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:19,060
I remember when we just
started this season.

460
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,650
Sam Kim was pointed out
the most by me.

461
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,850
He had groove but bad beats.

462
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,050
But he improved so much in
the past several months.

463
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,060
The frightening thing about today
and last week's performance is...

464
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,410
He's now relaxed.

465
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm not relaxed because this is a
live show and I could've judged better.

466
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:52,170
It was great to see
Sam having fun.

467
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,020
But there's one thing and that's
the falsetto in the middle.

468
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:01,180
It's usually hard for people with
a husky voice to sing in falsetto.

469
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,540
I wanted to give a high score
but you get a deduction for that.

470
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,120
YG's score...

471
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,210
Everything was great except for
the falsetto. What's his score?

472
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,010
It's 95!

473
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,570
95 is still high. Let's hear
the next commentary.

474
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:35,040
It's true that he improved the most
out of all the contestants this season.

475
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,240
He couldn't sing the high notes
before but he did today.

476
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,240
He improved in singing.
And the falsetto...

477
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,040
I thought the same as YG.

478
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:52,750
The singing wasn't that great but you
wrote the music and words for this part.

479
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,460
He even has the ability
to compose.

480
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,790
Another thing. Everyone's nervous
but Sam is having a concert here.

481
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,660
I know, right? He made
a lot of gestures.

482
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:14,230
You were acting coquettishly with
the audience, showing your talents.

483
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,280
That was cute.

Antenna Music's score...

485
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,730
Cute Sam Kim really hit those
high notes. What's his score?

486
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:25,810
It's 95!

487
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,870
- JYP's left.
- Thank you.

488
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:37,430
I was interested in whether he was
breathing with his chest or belly.

489
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:45,510
When he sang the first line,
his breathing was down here.

490
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:51,590
He gave a really nice sound.
He corrected that in a week.

491
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,660
I was thankful and it was great.

492
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,630
We can't talk only about singing
because there's a musician side to him.

493
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:10,290
He sang this in the blues scale
but the music is in major.

494
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:15,110
I think he did it without
knowing music theory.

495
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:20,270
He was singing and playing a blues
scale on top of a music in major.

496
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:25,260
It's frightening what he'll
become if he studies music.

497
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,270
But the falsetto the two judges
pointed out and one more thing...

498
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:36,350
You don't know how to control the speed
and show everything in the beginning.

499
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:41,910
These two things can be corrected
but you get a slight deduction.

500
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:43,120
JYP's score...

501
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,520
He showed his weakness in falsetto
and speed control. What's his score?

502
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,070

thankful to your teachers.

explode with emotion.

615
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:56,100
I was getting tired of hearing JYP's
songs all this time on KPOP STAR.

616
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,910
I was happy to hear You Hee-yeol's
"Passionate Goodbye."

00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,170
Are you still...

618
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:06,120
I thought it was going to be big since
it's the first time his song was sung.

619
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:13,850
And the video clip I saw was the
most touching of all on KPOP STAR.

620
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,740
- I was moved to tears.
- The producer is clapping.

621
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:19,830
So that's why they sang
"Passionate Goodbye."

622
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:26,070
I agree with JYP on...

623
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,420
I'll talk about what
was unfortunate.

624
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:38,650
They can sing much better than this but
because they set the concept first...

625
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:44,370
It overshadowed their singing and that
also happens to pro musicians at times.

626

I would have applauded if it wasn't
sung in an important round as today.

633
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,710
Let me first talk about
music briefly.

634
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:31,020
This song is not for an audition
since it's very hard to sing.

635
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:37,040
But they reminded me of
something that I had forgotten.

636
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,100
This song is a sad song. And
when I first wrote this song...

637
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:48,490
If it's like ABBA, because there is
no song like ABBA in Korea.

638
00:59:48,490 --> 00:59:53,140
When you three sang, "That's right! I was
thinking about ABBA when I wrote this!"

639
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,560
You made me realize, "This is
how it's supposed to be."

640
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:02,610
There was that moment but
there's one more thing.

641
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:10,560
Tens of thousands applied for KPOP STAR
but the reason you made it to TOP4 is...

642
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:18,330
Park Na-jin, Yeo In-hye, and
Ryu Tae-kyung stood together as one.

643
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:22,890
So the three of you should
continue in music, okay?

644
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,810
Last of all...

645
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:31,620

you knew this song was difficult yet...

this round where we choose the TOP3.

671

[Then who is Bernard's
private tutor?]

673
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:39,510
When you sing "I wanna go home,"
it feels like you want to go home.

674
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:43,280
But when you sang
"Yeah, that's how it was"...

675
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,110
It didn't have that sad feeling.

676
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:52,210

wasn't as if you were speaking.

[So who is his private tutor?]

678
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:58,930
The one who can teach him how to
sing as if speaking in Korean is...

679
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:03,020
Yoo Jae-ha.

680
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:07,180
I didn't know who he was.

681
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:16,030
His style is completely different from
mine, but as I kept on listening...

682
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:21,150

as if I was speaking.

When you are happy,
others are happier.

687
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:46,330
When something is good, it's better
when you have others with you.

688
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:51,720
It was hard because I didn't
have such people in Korea.

689
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:56,250

690
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:03,440

697

- I'll be speechless.
- Me too.

698

they closed their store...]

But you didn't show any
signs of hardship.

721
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:38,520
You're the best son to have
grown up like that.

722

I'm grateful you have

It meant a lot to me that
my parents came here.

724

You just heard him sing "Right Here Waiting."

Let's hear the commentaries.

730
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,040
You Hee-yeol, I think you
were moved to tears.

731
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:59,990
It's the first time my eyes welled
up with tears looking at a man.

732
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:05,360
Bernard, are you happy
that your parents came?

733
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,340
- I'm very happy.
- He's very happy.

01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,050
Did you eat a lot of chips?

735
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:12,310
I think I put on some weight.

736

Antenna Music's score...

738
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:24,890
It's the first time giving a
score without commentary...

739
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,470
It's 100!

740
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:33,780
It's the first 100 ever!
What is going on here?

741
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,880
This changes everything.

742
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:43,180
100? You Hee-yeol is known
to be objective but gave 100.

743
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,520
JYP?

744
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:52,920
I can't forget this day to
hear him sing like this.

745
01:11:54,570 --> 01:12:00,520
Once he gets into the emotion...

746
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,080
His voice and resonance are
on a different level.

747
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:09,160
It's a voice and resonance that
can't come from an Asian.

748
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,900
The difference is whether he's
connected to his emotions or not.

749
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:18,630
But I think the lyrics got him
into the emotion today.

750
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:22,870
I already know when
he sings the first line.

751
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:27,390
I was already groggy for
the remaining 3 minutes.

752
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:29,430
JYP's score...

753
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:33,940
I'm curious of the score.
He has 100 right now...

754
01:12:33,940 --> 01:12:37,080
It's 99!

755
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,370
He has 199. He's frightening.

756
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:43,020
His parents from the US
are very happy right now.

757
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,650
Let's hear from YG.

758
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:55,830
In the video clip, the first thing Bernard
worried about when he saw his parents...

759
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:59,030
What about the store?

760
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:10,320
My family ran an appliance repair store.
So it touched me and I was emotional.

761
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:19,980
I think I gave him the lowest score
and said the most bad things.

762
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:29,470
I compared Bernard to a
heavyweight many times.

763
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:36,940
I said that his opponents easily
avoid his punches because he's slow.

764
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:44,300
When he started off with
"ocean's apart"...

765
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:50,290
Compared to boxing, he made me groggy with
just one punch as soon as the bell rang.

766
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:53,060
It was one punch with
the first line.

767
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:56,810
The opponent is unconscious
and can't get back up.

768
01:13:56,810 --> 01:14:02,330
I thought Richard Marx couldn't
move us like him if he sang.

769
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:04,320
That's a compliment.

770
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,280
You were highly complimented for
"Home" and now "Right Here Waiting"...

771
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:16,220
It was very dramatic as you sang
with your parents here today.

772
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,630
YG's score...

773
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:22,750
Were his ardent feelings reflected
in the song? What is the score?

774
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,540
It's 100!

775

Bernard?

778
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:43,370
Because of the mood right now,
I think I'll ask in English.

779
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:53,050

I'm singing before my parents so...

score next week in the semifinal.

832
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:42,130
And one of them will depart
from KPOP STAR today.

833
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:49,190
The judges were given one envelope
and I was given two envelopes.

834
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:55,750
We don't know whose name is in it
since we have not opened them.

835
01:27:55,750 --> 01:28:05,440
The three whose names are here will
advance and one will be eliminated.

836
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:11,630
I'll interview them one by one.

837
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:16,070
We don't know the result yet.
Kwon Jina, how do you feel?

838
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:21,160
I'm very nervous but I won't have
regrets even if I'm eliminated.

839
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:23,190
No regrets even if you're eliminated.

840
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:28,650
Do you honestly think you'll advance
or do you feel uneasy about it?

841
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:30,510
It's fifty-fifty.

842
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,870
- Fifty-fifty?
- Yes.

843
01:28:31,870 --> 01:28:35,150
It was good when you heard
the commentaries but...

844
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:38,810
Are you feeling uneasy because
the viewers' votes take 40%?

845
01:28:38,810 --> 01:28:41,700
- Yes.
- I see.

846
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,810
Sam Kim?

847
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:54,830
I was scared and nervous at first
performing before an audience on stage.

848
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:59,080
But it's my playground now
and I'm having fun.

849
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:03,230
Even though I'm eliminated,
I can leave without regrets.

850
01:29:03,230 --> 01:29:07,960
I felt that you were enjoying it.

851
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,290
You made many gestures you didn't
make during the rehearsal.

852
01:29:12,290 --> 01:29:17,860
What did this mean when you were
playing the guitar? Were you excited?

853
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,760
I don't know. It just came out.

854
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,770
It just came out? So those
gestures just came out. I see.

855
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:31,240
The Shorties? The result isn't out
but I saw Tae-kyung crying.

856
01:29:31,240 --> 01:29:34,450
Weren't you crying? I saw
tears welled up in your eyes.

857
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:42,220
- You didn't cry?
- I thought it was our last...

858
01:29:42,220 --> 01:29:47,270
I felt sad that I won't see
those that I got close to.

859
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:51,400
Does that mean you think
you'll be eliminated?

860
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,450
Why? Does everyone think so too?

861
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:59,740
It's not decided with just
the judges' score.

862
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:03,170
We still have the viewers' votes.
What do you think, Na-jin?

863
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:10,590
We don't know the result but I would like
to say we did our best and have no regrets.

864
01:30:10,590 --> 01:30:12,920
I see.

865
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:18,380
And how do you feel,
Yeo In-hye?

866
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:26,680
We're thankful that we even made it this far,
and our singing will improve with practice.

867
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,040
So we'll try harder and practice.

868
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:32,350
Alright. Thank you.

869
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,450
And Bernard Park?

870
01:30:35,450 --> 01:30:41,310
We're waiting for the announcement.
How do you feel right now?

871
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:47,700
We have a lot of fans and I don't know
how the viewers' votes will turn out.

872
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,570
I place my trust in my fans.

873
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,920
He doesn't know about the votes
but will place his trust in them.

874
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:01,110
He's already a star. I think
he's a K-pop star already.

875
01:31:01,110 --> 01:31:05,740
The announcement begins
once I open the envelope.

876
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:08,120
YG... YG?

877
01:31:08,120 --> 01:31:13,220
We don't know who'll be eliminated
but any last words for them?

878
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:18,120
I'll say one thing.

879
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,690
Honestly, we don't want
to send anyone away.

880
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:27,150
It was predictable in
Seasons 1 and 2.

881
01:31:27,150 --> 01:31:32,000
But the TOP4 this season are
skilled and it's hard to predict.

882
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,140
We don't know the result but
we don't want to send anyone away.

883
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:44,090
Alright. The judges don't want to send
anyone away but one has to be sent.

884
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:50,710
I will now announce the
first semifinalist!

885
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,550
[Who is the first semifinalist?]

886
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:59,710
I will open one of the
two envelopes in my hand.

887
01:32:09,410 --> 01:32:14,880
I saw it and only
I know the result.

888
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:25,980
The first semifinalist for the TOP3
show of KPOP STAR Season 3 is...

889
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:29,080
Who do you think it is?

890
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,710
Who?

891
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:34,660
That's right! Please congratulate!

892
01:32:34,660 --> 01:32:36,960
It's Bernard Park!

893
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,700
He put on a great performance
before his parents.

894
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:50,410
He had the highest judges' score
and it looks like nothing changed.

895
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,080
Bernard, I'll ask you
a second time.

896
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:11,840
I think everyone understood.

897
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:18,460
I think his parents are the happiest.
Could you move to the winners seat?

898
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:27,820
Alright. The first is Bernard Park with
the highest judges' score at 299.

899
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:31,410
It think he got a good score
from the viewers' votes as well.

900
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:35,820
I'll now announce the
second semifinalist.

901
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:40,080
I will open the last of the
two envelopes in my hand.

902
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,360
I don't know the result yet
but I will open it now.

903
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:50,250
The second semifinalist for the TOP3
show of KPOP STAR Season 3 is...

904
01:33:55,540 --> 01:33:57,290
I opened the one I just opened.

905
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:02,910
I'm sorry. Bernard's
name was on it again.

906
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:08,320
This is the one.
It's this envelope.

907
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:13,410
[Who is the second semifinalist?]

908
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:20,540
I saw it. I saw who it is.

909
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:25,610
Who do you think is the
second after Bernard?

910
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:32,190
Will your guess be right?

911
01:34:32,190 --> 01:34:36,080
Will it go according to the
judges' score or is there a twist?

912
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:39,470
The result reflecting 40%
of the viewers' votes...

913
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:42,980
The second semifinalist is...

914
01:34:42,980 --> 01:34:46,860
Please congratulate!

915
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:48,330
It's Kwon Jina!

916
01:34:52,140 --> 01:35:00,880
Congratulations. Kwon Jina with the
next highest judges' score is second.

917
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,800
Your thoughts?

918
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:10,770
I thank you and will do
my best. Love you!

919
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:17,340
You said fifty-fifty. What
were you uneasy about?

920
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:21,290
Why did you think you
would be eliminated?

921
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,170
The viewers' votes...

922
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:25,910
The mood here was great but
it was the viewers' votes.

923
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:29,350
Alright. Congratulations and
please move to the winners seat.

924
01:35:30,370 --> 01:35:31,950
Please give her a hand!

925
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:40,320
The last envelope remains.

926
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,680
It's not in my hands
but in the judges' hands.

927
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:50,500
The name of either Sam Kim
or The Shorties is written.

928
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:57,860
Who is the last seminfinalist?

929
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,010
I'm undertaking an
important assignment.

930
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:03,030
I didn't open it yet.

931
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:08,810
Please open it.

932
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:15,650
There's a four point difference
between Sam Kim and The Shorties.

933
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:20,840
But what is the result after
calculating the viewers' votes?

934
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,780
- I'll look at it.
- Alright.

935
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:29,300
Both You Hee-yeol
and JYP saw it.

936
01:36:29,300 --> 01:36:31,010
- Alright!
- Yes?

937
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:36,300
The last semifinalist is...

938
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,130
Is it Sam Kim or The Shorties?

939
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:47,630
We won't be seeing one
of them next week.

940
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:55,250
I'll announce it now.
The last semifinalist is...

941
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,160
It's Sam Kim!

942
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:58,330
Congratulations Sam Kim!

943
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,390
Please join them.

944
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:10,800
The semifinalists are Bernard Park,
Kwon Jina, and Sam Kim.

945
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,680
Unfortunately, The Shorties will
be leaving KPOP STAR today.

946
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,470
- Na-jin?
- Yes?

947
01:37:17,470 --> 01:37:21,900
You look quite calm
but how do you feel?

948
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:26,180
I first thank God that
we made it this far.

949
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:33,140
I want to show our gratitude to
the judges although we lacked.

950
01:37:33,140 --> 01:37:40,280
I thank the production crew, music director,
and the band members that helped us.

951
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:50,950
I also thank our teachers, juniors,
and fans that cheered for us.

952
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:57,650
We will continue to do our best, and the
reason we came this far is because of...

953
01:37:57,650 --> 01:38:01,810
Tae-kyung and...

954
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:04,520
In-hye...

955
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,140
Please give her a hand.

956
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:13,710
She's overwhelmed and crying.

957
01:38:13,710 --> 01:38:18,420
I wasn't able to say thanks...

958
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:24,770
But I would like to take this chance
and say thanks to my two friends.

959
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:29,440
I love you and
let's try harder.

960
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,580
Good luck to The Shorties.

961
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:39,310
The Shorties have been eliminated.

962
01:38:39,310 --> 01:38:46,590
Bernard Park, Sam Kim, and Kwon Jina
will be in next week's semifinal.

963
01:38:46,590 --> 01:38:52,660
We had YG and JYP weeks and next
week will be Antenna Music week.

964
01:38:52,660 --> 01:38:56,000
Let's look forward to how
You Hee-yeol will influence them.

965
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,440
This was KPOP STAR Season 3, a real
audition where dreams turn into reality.

966
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:03,610
We'll impress you more
next week. Goodbye!

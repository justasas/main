00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,040
A harsh and tough journey
to become a K-pop star.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,330
Currently, 8 teams
have survived.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,040
The stage for the TOP8
is bigger and enormous.

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,690
The 1:1 battle system
is used again.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,720
Don't blame me
for picking.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,990
Ye-dam, don't pick blue.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,390
I don't want
to face him.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,480
[Who is their opponent?]

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,840
They are shocked at the
opponent they chose.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,330
No one can let their guard
down in this fierce battle.

11
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,030
The TOP8 battle is
filled with tension.

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,060
It starts now!

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,160
[Broadcast live from
Bucheon Gymnasium]

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,880
This is Survival Audition
KPOP STAR Season 2!

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,070
The TOP8 battle will
proceed as 1:1 battle.

16
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,850
I introduce to you
the contestants.

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,690
First is 2,000 won and
Akdong Musician!

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,630
They have unique personalities.
Looking forward to their match.

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,460
Next is Choi Ye-geun
and Andrew Choi!

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,240
It's a battle between professional
composer and genius arranger.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,530
Next battle is...

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,030
Raccoon Boys
and Bang Ye-dam!

23
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,190
Both get over 2 million views.
We look forward to them as well.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,080
Last of all is...

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,440
YouU and Shin Ji-hoon!

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,350
I think we will be
glued to this match.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,700
A round of applause
to our TOP8 finalists!

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,860
Hi, I'm Yoon Do-hyun,
MC for KPOP STAR.

29
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,130
TOP8 finalists were decided
after last week's fierce battle.

30
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,080
Two will be eliminated
this week for TOP6.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,880
This week's battle will
be 1:1 battle again.

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,920
The winner goes to TOP6 and the
loser is in danger of elimination.

33
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,460
Among the 4 teams in
danger of elimination...

34
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:04,700
1 with viewers' votes and 1
with judges' wildcard will pass.

35
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,030
I look forward
to the battle.

36
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,510
I will first introduce those who
are always the talk of the town.

37
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,740
I introduce the three judges!

38
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,900
BoA of SM!

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,220

41

The crowd's going wild.

42
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,610
It seems BoA is getting
prettier on KPOP STAR.

43
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,230
Thank you. I'm wearing bright
colors since it's almost spring.

44
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,770
You look gorgeous.

45
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,000
We request a sharp
and fair judgment.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,700
I'll reveal the battle order
and the finalists' number.

47
00:03:53,860 --> 00:04:00,130
1st is No. 1 Choi Ye-geun
and No. 2 Andrew Choi.

48
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,690
2nd is No. 3 YouU and
No. 4 Shin Ji-hoon.

49
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:18,260
3rd is No. 5 Raccoon Boys
and No. 6 Bang Ye-dam.

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:27,800
Last is No. 7 2,000 won and
No. 8 Akdong Musician.

51
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,450
It won't be an easy battle.
I anticipate it to be exciting.

52
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:42,360
Boom will explain the voting
system and how it's totaled.

53
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,630
Hi, I'm MC Boom here live
at KPOP STAR's battle!

54
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,000
Give me a shout!

55
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,070
Things are really
heating up here.

56
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:02,110
The most important thing here
at KPOP STAR is your votes.

57
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:09,220
You can start voting when
your favorite is battling.

58
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,150
You can't vote for them
when their battle is over.

59
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,550
Keep that in mind. I'll
explain how to vote.

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:29,990
On your cellphone, text #0606 with
the finalist's Korean name or number.

61
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,480
One important thing. You can
vote for more than one person.

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:45,340
But you can't make multiple votes
for one person. Remember that.

63
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,540
As the weeks go by, it's
getting hotter here.

64
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,350
Your votes are
very important.

65
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:02,250
Your votes allowed Akdong Musician
and Shin Ji-hoon to pass last week.

66
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,130
We request your
participation.

67
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,540
We will now begin
our 1st battle.

68
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,200
It's Choi Ye-geun and
Andrew Choi. Excited?

69
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,480
Voting for them will
also begin now!

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,270
[Choi Ye-geun vs Andrew Choi]

71
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,170
[Hard to predict this one!]

72
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,460
These two...

73
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,650
Their chance of
winning is 50%.

74
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,100
Both have superior musicality;
the ability to interpret the song.

75
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,520
The problem is the song.

76
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,940
Who will transform from
a musician to a singer?

77
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,210
This is a battle of
two musicians.

78
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:02,150
She plays chords I didn't
expect. She's a genius.

79
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:08,160
He helps me a lot music-wise
and we are on friendly terms.

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,430
It's complicated since
we have to battle.

81
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,980
The song I'm singing is
Jessie J's "Price Tag".

82
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,000
[It contains a social message
criticizing mammonism]

83
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:28,100
I arranged on the piano and showed
my colors through voice until now.

84
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,640
Since the stage
is bigger...

85
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,760
I wanted to express my colors
through stage production.

86
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,590
[It contains mostly her
thoughts and message]

87
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,960
To describe the disparity
between the rich and poor...

88
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,050
Only people with money
are on this side.

89
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,150
And poor people without
money are on this side.

90
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,440
That's how I
made the stage.

91
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,100
To show people getting
run over by money...

92
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,430
People move to the right
then left on stage.

93
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,120
I want to sing this to those
who are rich but not happy.

94
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,880
I'll be satisfied with the stage
if my message gets across.

95
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,210
[Price Tag - Jessie J]

96
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,020
No. 1 Choi Ye-geun made the
stage flashy with her colors.

97
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:24,000
I think this week's stage
will be the hardest.

98
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,820
Because I'll be showing a
side I never showed before.

99
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,470
I'm going to dance
while singing.

100
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,230
Andrew's dancing?
What do I do?

101
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,430
It's Usher's "DJ Got
Us Fallin' in Love".

102
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,990
I danced when I was
in high school.

103
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,060
It's been a while
since I danced.

104
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,570
I forgot a lot.

105
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,520
She's smart, nice,
and pretty.

106
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,930
She always thinks
about me.

107
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm thankful to meet such
a person... and happy.

108
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:16,110
Since I have to sing
while dancing...

109
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,820
I'm worried my voice
will be unstable.

110
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,130
But I'll dance well
for my girlfriend.

111
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,730
[DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love - Usher]

112
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,820
I didn't know he
had such a side.

113
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,650
No. 2 Andrew Choi gave
an amazing performance.

114
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,750
His battle with Choi
Ye-geun is unpredictable.

115
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,030
I'm curious what
the judges think.

116
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,120
Let's hear the
commentary.

117
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:23,770
It's hard to tell who's better
since it was appealing.

118
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:29,520
Choi Ye-geun did almost
everything, even staging.

119
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,620
It was fun to see the stage
you made using the lyrics.

120
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,190
The scales you sang in the
middle were hard, but you got it.

121
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:49,570
You arranged it differently and
sang it in your style. It was good.

122
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:56,290
Andrew, I never expected
to see you dance.

123
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,160
But you gave a good performance
with exciting music. It was good.

124
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,850
I never dreamt you would
propose before you began.

125
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,160
I enjoyed it.

126
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,050
Thank you very much.

127
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:14,040
Next please.

128
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:28,900
Every time I see Choi Ye-geun, she
is like a uniquely designed sofa.

129
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,650
She's a very expensive sofa
because she's one-of-a-kind.

130
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:39,980
It's a sofa that looks good
but uncomfortable to sit on.

131
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:51,440
You have great skills and techniques,
but I feel burdened to listen to it.

132
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,600
I want to ask Andrew a
question. How old are you?

133
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,540
- Mike's not working.
- Oh, okay.

134
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,810
I remember you to be in
your mid-30s, correct?

135
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:10,560
What's your definition
of success?

136
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,970
It's not working?
I'm sorry.

137
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,280
The mike works.

138
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,310
He didn't understand.

139
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,060
He didn't understand?
I'm sorry.

140
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,340
- He can't speak Korean...
- Thank you, JYP.

141
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,950
- Can I answer in English?
- Sure.

142
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,490
What did he say?

143
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:36,360
Success is doing
what I love.

144
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,200
I admire you. That's the
answer I was waiting for.

145
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,320
Most people would
answer it as money.

146
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,330
How much do you have
to make to be happy?

147
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,540
You just gave the
correct answer.

148
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,770
I think the greatest success
in life is to be happy.

149
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,500
You officially proposed to
your girlfriend today...

150
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,620
And you're enjoying music
even in your mid-30s.

151
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,290
That tells me that you
are already successful.

152
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,350
Today's stage was very
moving. Good job.

153
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,210
Thank you very much.

154
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,840
And JYP?

155
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,860
In regards to Choi Ye-geun, it's
very similar to what YG said.

156
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,100
I was thinking what advice
to give as I was listening.

157
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,830
Listen to music of singers that
sing as if they are speaking.

158
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:34,120
Without showy techniques. For
example, Yoo Jae-ha in Korea.

159
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,790
Or The Beatles in the West.

160
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,670
It will touch our heart if
you sing as if speaking.

161
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,620
Many singers that sang as
if speaking succeeded...

162
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,610
Even though they didn't
have a powerful voice.

163
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,540
But those that didn't
sing as if speaking...

164
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,000
Although voice is powerful,
rarely succeeded.

165
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,040
I want to give
you that advice.

166
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,970
Andrew sings very well since
you know the feel of the song.

167
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,860
But I want to say something.
Since you sang Usher's song...

168
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,060
This is what I think, but...

169
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:16,190
How Usher sang in his 3rd
album changed from before.

170
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,600
His vocalization was open from 3rd
album on and became a great singer.

171
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,770
Singing is the same, but breathing
and vocalization were unstable before.

172
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,290
It was as if the sound was pressed.
Of course, this is my opinion.

173
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:34,620
If you listen to his songs with
that in mind, it'll be a great example.

174
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,770
Your interpretation of
the music is excellent.

175
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:42,410
But just as YG said, I envy you
for proposing to your girlfriend.

176
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,920
Thank you very much.

177
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,730
He gave an unexpected performance
and his proposal left an impression.

178
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,470
She showed her talents through
staging and heard many things.

179
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,310
Please announce the
victor of this battle.

180
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,820
I had a hard time.

181
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,160
The victor chosen
by SM is...

182
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:18,520
Both showed amazing techniques, new
challenges, and were unperturbed.

183
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,220
It was hard to choose.

184
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,740
The victor is Andrew Choi.

185
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,720
It's Andrew Choi!
Congratulations!

186
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,970
He was chosen by BoA.

187
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,560
Please announce
the next victor.

188
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,960
Both have pros and cons.
But what we see is...

189
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,230
Who has a higher chance in getting
their shortcomings fixed quickly?

190
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:51,460
From that point of view, one
of them has a higher chance.

191
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,500
The victor chosen
by JYP is...

192
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,170
- Choi Ye-geun.
- Congratulations!

193
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,820
It's neck and neck!

194
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:08,610
The score is 1:1. YG's choice
will determine the outcome.

195
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:14,540
This battle is the most
difficult because...

196
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,570
It's 1:1 and both have
outstanding skills.

197
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:28,630
The victor chosen
by YG is...

198
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,500
I chose the comfortable
and happy side.

199
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,730
- It's Andrew Choi.
- Congratulations!

200
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,140
The first TOP6 finalist is
Andrew. Congratulations!

201
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,370
Choi Ye-geun put on a good
stage and lost, but it's not over.

202
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:55,050
The final decision is
made with your votes.

203
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,960
Those who are cheering
for her, please vote.

204
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,920
The next teams have
different charms.

Wow, this...

208
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,060
I really don't know. It
doesn't lean to one side.

209
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,610
How did this happen?

210
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,700
[But]

211
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,510
[They're laughing hard]

212
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,380
[Seems like they
were working out]

213
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,980
- You're so funny.
- Why don't I go up?

heads off]

[Shin Ji-hoon wins
in sit-ups!]

216
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,540
Ji-hoon was the first to
speak on KPOP STAR.

217
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:55,750
We were close like sisters
but are now opponents.

218
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,950
I was taken aback, but
this is a survival.

219
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,500
We have to compete.

220
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,340
What do I do?

221
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,540
The times when they are good
and bad fluctuates greatly.

222
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,600
Which YouU or Shin Ji-hoon will
appear? That will determine it.

223
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
What are you singing?

224
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,900
I already have a man...

225
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,150
- Really?
- Yes.

226
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,210
It's going to be new.
It's hard to imagine.

227
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,370
2,000 won already sang
"I Have a Girl".

228

[2,000 won showed
their witty raps]

229
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,940
Choi Ye-geun also sang it.

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,870
[Highly complimented for
extraordinary arrangement]

231
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:53,290
When the girl group sings this,
I believe it will be different.

232
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,320
It's going to be different
from the group dance we did.

233
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,160
It's going to be a fantastic
performance with a story.

234
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,640
Let's go, YouU!

235

[I Have a Girl - JYP]

236
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:27,800
No. 3 YouU reinterpreted
JYP's "I Have a Girl".

237
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,860
She never had lessons
and just sings.

238
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,860
It's terrifying that she
could sing like that.

239
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,110
I'm going to sing
Kim Kwang-jin's "Letter".

240
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,420
The lyrics touched
my heart.

241
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,730
"I want you to be happy.
Take this heart of mine."

242
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,160
I felt sad.

243
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:06,980
In the 16 years I lived,
I never had a boyfriend.

244
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:12,320
I feel sad when I sing,
and I start to sniffle.

245
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:20,250
Shin Ji-hoon has a faint and
dreamlike sadness in her voice.

246
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:26,210
I think she'll sing well! She
has that sensibility! She's just...

247
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,000
[But]

248
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:35,670
I was told I need techniques.
I think I'm really bad at it.

249
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,770
There are composers and those that
arrange the song in their style.

250
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:48,330
But singing wasn't
the goal for me.

251
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:54,320
I always feel
that I'm behind.

252
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:58,150

speaks her heart]

- Guess it's puberty.
- I think so.

Putting aside whether I'm
better or worse than others...

257
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,420
As long as I'm on stage,
my goal is to do better.

Thank you.

No. 4 Shin Ji-hoon calmly
finished her stage.

261
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:46,080
Both teams battled with
contrasting charms.

262
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,490
What did the judges think?
JYP's expression was memorable.

263
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,450
Please step forward and we'll
listen to the commentary.

264
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:06,660
I believe every human being is a
beautiful instrument made by God.

265
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:13,030
Only your special and beautiful sound
will come out if you make it.

266
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:21,850
When humans are tense and squeeze
their throat, that sound isn't made.

267
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:28,180
Especially in the high notes,
that sound doesn't come out.

268
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:38,060
But Shin Ji-hoon makes that sound
in the low, mid, and high range.

269
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,510
It's hard even for me, and I
learn a lot just by watching.

270
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,010
It made me think that a human being
was made to produce beautiful sounds.

271
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,170
That was Shin Ji-hoon's
commentary.

272
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:59,470
The previous commentary I made was
the singing wasn't as if speaking.

273
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,610
When YouU sang, it was as
if they were speaking.

274
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,030
All five of you have a great
talent for singing and dancing.

275
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,230
But Min-joo has both.

276
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:15,530
You started off
with a waltz.

277
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:20,230
The dance for popular music
is 4/4, but a waltz is 3/4.

278
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,350
It's awkward when
you dance that.

279
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,310
It's amazing how beautifully
you expressed the waltz.

280
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,310
I enjoyed it.

281
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,490
Thank you very much.

282
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,000
That was his commentary.
Let's listen to the next.

283
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:39,620
Son Yoo-ji of YouU,
do you live in Bucheon?

284
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:49,310
When I came here, I saw
a banner cheering her.

285
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,900
I believe Lee Hi is
also from Bucheon.

286
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,520
So I enjoyed it.

287
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,750
Son Yoo-ji, I would
like to make a request.

288
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:02,480
Can you do the choreography
for that part please?

289
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,590
- That part...
- Do you remember?

290
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,840
Yes. It's that move.

291
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,960
It's strange. She's the youngest
and the shortest in the group.

292
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,190
I was surprised how perfectly
she did those moves.

293
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,750
- You were entranced by that?
- Yes, I was.

294
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:27,750
- The smaller, the shrewder.
- I see.

295
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:35,260
I thank you for putting in less
moves as I said before, but...

296
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:43,120
One unfortunate thing is that you
didn't show anything with the dance.

297
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,640
Shin Ji-hoon...

298
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,000
You were much better today.

299
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,270
I don't know where you
went, but you were good.

300
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:02,290
Techniques, high and low notes are
useless. What's terrifying is that...

301
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:09,880
Just like confessing one's love,
She moves the heart with music.

302
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,260
I don't know if she sang well,
but she moved us and the viewers.

303
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,360
Good job.

304
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,240
Thank you very much.

305
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,200
BoA?

306
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,030
Since they were long,
I will make it short.

307
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:34,080
It must have been hard for the
five of you to prepare in a week.

308
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:41,250
I enjoyed it, and I also had an
eye on Son Yoo-ji's moves.

309
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:48,200
I never imagined that Shin Ji-hoon
would improve in a short period.

310
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,770
Especially the ending
notes and vibrato.

311
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:57,110
But you changed the
mood with a little vibrato.

312
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,610
Shin Ji-hoon returned.
I enjoyed it.

313
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,400
Thank you very much.

314
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,900
YouU was complimented for
improving in dancing and singing.

315
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:10,450
Shin Ji-hoon received a favorable
comment for moving our hearts.

316

Rather than who's worse,
both did very well.

319
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,450
I had to choose who was
a little more better.

320

now in the TOP6!

Shin Ji-hoon, the beautiful
voice that moves the heart.

to TOP6 unanimously!

It's not over for YouU
so don't be disappointed.

Please look forward to that.

the next unpredictable battle.

334
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:33,370
It's between Raccoon
Boys and Bang Ye-dam!

335
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,490
[Raccoon Boys vs Bang Ye-dam]

336
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
We're very afraid.

337
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:48,090
He has less stage
fright than us.

338
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,020
He's a baby.

339
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:56,100
He likes to be carried and
be in someone's bosom.

340
00:39:56,100 --> 00:40:01,390
He never watches TV alone.
He's always next to someone.

341
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,620
He's cute, but when
he's on stage...

342
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:12,620
He does a 180. He doesn't speak
right before he goes on stage.

343
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,100
I don't know if he's
trying to stay focused...

344
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,970
Bang Ye-dam is moving
up right now.

345
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:22,800
But Raccoon Boys have
the potential to win.

346
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,300
The problem is choice of song
and how it'll be interpreted.

347
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,460
[What did they choose?]

348
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,930
We never sang jazz.

349
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,180
We're singing
Fin.K.L's "Now".

350
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,820
[90s legendary hit song
Fin.K.L's "Now"]

351
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,410
I grew up in the States,
but I listened to gayo.

352
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:50,100
I knew Lee Hyori,
but not Fin.K.L.

353
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,830
She's in Fin.K.L, right?

354
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:59,090
It's a pity we couldn't show
our arrangements last round.

355
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:03,650
To receive the commentary, "Just
as expected from Raccoon Boys"...

356
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:05,560
We prepared a lot.

357
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,330
[Ye-dam watches them practicing]

358
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,610
Why did they deceive
me that they're bad?

359
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,510
I'm afraid of 2,000 won, but
more so with Raccoon Boys.

360
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,480
[They make him feel small]

361
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,510
Ye-dam is a strong contestant, but
we'll show a great stage in our style.

362
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,370
Let's go, Raccoon Boys!

363
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,400
[Now - Fin.K.L]

364
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,380
OK, you look stunning
Your entrance is different

365
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,220
For all the men waiting
This is the highlight

366
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:59,680
That fine bodyline's my type
It's a style everyone wants

367
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,580
Wolves will definitely come
Girl tell me, when you got time?

368
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,740
I approach carefully
And speak

369
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,550
I say a few words
Throw your heart with a splash

370
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,290
Your love isn't interested
It's like a deserted island

371
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,220
I get seasick, but I want to get
On your dream boat

372
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,830
They sing any song
in their style.

373
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,660
No. 5 Raccoon Boys'
teamwork stood out.

374
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,490
I don't know about this.
Raccoon Boys are in a fix.

375
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,380
- Ye-dam...
- It's Bang Ye-dam.

376
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,800
What do we do?

377
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,260
We're very afraid.

378
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:47,540
When we use the word
"frightening", we don't know.

379
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,050
Bang Ye-dam is frightening since we
don't know what's going to come out.

380
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,130
Are you dancing again?

381
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,210
- Well, I...
- Don't dance.

382
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,590
Please don't.

383
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,620
[How does he feel
about their fear?]

384
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,580
I guess I'm unlucky.

385
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,410
I went against 2,000
won last week.

386
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,790
This week I'm up against
Raccoon Boys.

387
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,640
I don't know why
I picked them.

388
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,310
On top of that, I
have a bad cold.

389
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:23,090
I'm worried because
my condition is bad.

390
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,520
But I'm going to
practice hard.

391
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:32,330
I'm singing Stevie
Wonder's "Sir Duke".

392
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:40,040
I'm familiar with it and think
I can arrange it well.

393
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:48,430
I discussed with the music director
and thought how to dance in this song.

394
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:50,410
I don't know
what to do.

395
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:58,030
I'm afraid of Raccoon Boys,
but I'll try hard. Let's go!

396
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,520
[Sir Duke - Stevie Wonder]

397
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,960
An amazing stage by
a 12-year-old boy!

398
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:30,090
No. 6 Bang Ye-dam gives
a surprise every stage.

399
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:35,400
Both Raccoon Boys and
Bang Ye-dam did well.

400
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,670
It truly was a
fierce battle.

401
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,380
What did the judges think?
Let's hear the commentary.

402
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,060
Am I first again?
I'm not calm yet.

403
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:52,530
It's written all
over your face.

404
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,760
The one who came out as
Ye-dam's girl, can I be her?

405
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,640
I'll start first with
Raccoon Boys.

406
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:12,620
Since the live broadcast began,
you are hesitant to show.

407
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:19,570
"Now" started calmly and there's
something big in the middle.

408
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:25,200
I don't know if it was high,
but Brian couldn't go through.

409
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:32,060
I thought you should lower
the key in the next round.

410
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:41,190
Bang Ye-dam is the most
frightening and strongest.

411
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:47,800
He does get extra points
for being young.

412
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,510
How could someone
young do that? But...

413
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:57,480
Compared to existing singers,
he plays with the rhythm...

414
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:03,190
It wasn't choreography, but he had
gestures here and there in the song.

415
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:11,410
It doesn't just come out.
That's hard even for me.

416
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:17,500
I was amazed, and that role
as his girl is tempting.

417
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,990
- Didn't give up on it?
- I enjoyed it.

418
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:21,340
Thank you very much.

419
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:25,110
Next please.

420
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:33,340
I said in the interview that
Raccoon Boys were perfect.

421
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:40,560
But it seems you only hit to
1st or 2nd base every stage.

422
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:49,210
You don't surprise us anymore
and are just playing it safe.

423
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:52,870
Kim Min-suk leaves a
lingering impression.

424
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:57,780
We are in dire need of rappers
here and in the underground.

425
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:07,220
The other two are good too, but I
think Min-suk's discovery is big.

426
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:18,120
Why are the judges surprised
and praise that 12-year-old?

427
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:21,600
The viewers might not
understand at times.

428
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:28,590
Bang Ye-dam first sang
Justin Bieber's "Baby".

429
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,220
Second was Michael Jackson.

430
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,370
Today was Stevie Wonder.

431
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,780
These three seem similar,
but they are different.

432
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:46,240
Reinterpreting and singing
them on stage is...

433
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:51,350
As BoA said, it's hard for existing
singers because of their color.

434
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:57,840
It's amazing that he does the motion,
style, and rhythm befitting the song.

435
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,260
It really touched me.
You did a good job.

436
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,700
Thank you very much.

437
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,340
Lastly, let's hear
JYP's commentary.

438
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,320
Mine overlaps with YG's. I'm
going to talk about Min-suk too.

439
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:14,400
In the lyrics, "Looks and
entrance are different."

440
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,710
"Highlight for the men."

441
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:22,670
"Different" and "highlight"
actually don't rhyme.

442
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,470
Both words are different.

443
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,700
He makes us to hear
as if they rhyme.

444
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:31,130
It's called slant
rhyme in hip-hop.

445
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:35,820
Making us hear as if it rhymes.
Rappers like T.I. are good at it.

446
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:40,380
I'm amazed at that ability.
I want to compliment you.

447
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:46,850
Brian's high notes aren't open like
the rest, but it's in the right direction.

448
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,720
Just practice as
usual, even McKay.

449
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,650
I believe you're on
the right direction.

450
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:57,140
I don't know what to
say about Bang Ye-dam.

451
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:05,910
Among the TOP8, Shin Ji-hoon
and Bang Ye-dam are...

452
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,820
Showing the existing singers a
demonstration of vocalization.

453
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:17,520
It's perfectly open in the high
notes and also when they hit it.

454
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,920
It's amazing. Viewers might
think why we are excited.

455
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,160
Rhythm is more important
than singing.

456
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:32,280
Bang Ye-dam sings while
perfectly being in rhythm.

457
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:37,810
It's hard to sing while
having that groove first.

458
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:38,920
I enjoyed it.

459
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,120
Thank you very much.

460
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:46,760
Now it's time to
announce the victor.

461
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:57,260
The victor chosen
by YG is...

462
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,870
The one who hit a homer.

463
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,400
- Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

464
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:06,020
He was chosen by YG.

465
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:12,680
The victor chosen
by SM is...

466
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,120
- Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

467
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:19,850
He's now in TOP6!
Let's hear JYP's choice.

468
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:25,080
The victor chosen by
JYP is also Bang Ye-dam.

469
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,090
Congratulations for making
it to TOP6 unanimously.

470
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:33,640
It's not over for Raccoon Boys.
There is the viewers' votes.

471
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:41,020
Now the battle between 2,000 won
and Akdong Musician begins!

472
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,530
[2,000 won vs Akdong Musician]

473
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,410
We're the same
whoever we face.

474
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,130
We are in trouble.

475
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,440
Always those four words:
We are in trouble.

476
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,050
[Blue!]

477
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,480
No one's happy to go up
against Akdong Musician.

478
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,580
Why did Soo-hyun
pick that?

479
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:14,520
Chan-hyuk also had
a hard time, but...

480
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,450
He saw us with
the blue ball.

481
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:19,460
He was the happiest that
day out of the entire month.

482
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,790
Contestants release their potential
when they battle against us.

483
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,880
Bang Ye-dam, Choi Ye-geun,
and Akdong Musician...

484
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,220
We help them with
their potential.

485
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,050
[They feel bitter and
give a hollow smile]

486
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,580
This is our goal.

487
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,560
This time we won't help
you with your potential.

488
00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:42,660
Many will be surprised when
they hear our choice.

489
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,680
We're going to sing
SISTAR's "Alone".

490
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,830
[Unexpected choice! Two guys
sing a girl group's song]

491
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:56,830
We want to show them that we
are always taking new challenges.

492
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,620
We split one situation
into two standpoints.

493
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,250
I'm having a hard
time being alone.

494
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,310
I'm the opposite from him,
"Who cares if I'm alone?"

495
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:14,480
How much are they going to
show their ideas and sense?

496
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,170
If we were potential
helpers until now...

497
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,790
We will now release
our potential.

498
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:23,680
2,000 won. I want to
win at least once.

499
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,010
Me too.

500
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:47,080
You dimwit. Couldn't forget her?
Fool! How can you be so stupid?

501
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:53,230
Love changes. It comes and goes
Everyone breaks up as if dying

502
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:55,610
Don't do anything
Everyone goes through it

503
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:05,680
[Alone - SISTAR]

504
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,320
Crying while listening to ballads
Isn't cool like UV

505
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,970
Where's your attitude?
You got nothing

506
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:49,580
I'll fix you with a pretty model
Go see some flowers this spring

507
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,920
What's with that look? Tell me
What the heck is your problem?

508
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,690
I'll tell you what you can do
Let's say you're at the movies

509
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,400
A seat in the front amongst couples
There's one left and it's yours

510
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,940
You can sing at the karaoke
No need for reservations

511
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,450
Don't be discouraged. Breakups come
In roughly like waves and go away

512
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:40,130
Look at me. Single from birth
Why can't you be single?

513
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:55,580
It's not hard to do things alone
Throw that bias away

514
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,130
Know how to handle breakups
Then it'll hurt less

515
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,900
Not enough time to spend it alone
There's too many things to enjoy

516
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,600
You're a fool to drown in sorrow
In life, you come and leave alone

517
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:39,370
No. 7 2,000 won's witty
ideas and staging stood out.

518
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:49,760
If we showed only our
songs until now...

519
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,510
We want to show you
a different taste.

520
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:56,850
We arranged a song.

521
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,250
[Compete with an arrangement
and not their own song?]

522
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:05,200
We arranged SHINee's
"Ring Ding Dong".

523
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,720
[How did they reinterpret this song
with an intense electronic sound?]

524
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,660
We thought if we should
go as rock or something.

525
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,220
Then we chose to go
acoustic since that fits us.

526
01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:21,040
Guitar will just
get the point.

527
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,520
We set the mood with guitar,
jembe, and the conga.

528
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:32,270
You'll get to see the best
of acoustic instruments.

529
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,350
[Akdong Musician is
confident but...]

530
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:38,300
Hyo-bin sings well
and Il-do raps well.

531
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,010
They do everything.
They're entertainers.

532
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:42,270
We're nervous.

533
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:45,900
Does Akdong Musician have
a weapon to fight with?

534
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,960
A cuteness they
don't have...

535
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,580
[This is their cuteness]

536
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:03,500
Please discover another
side to us and be happy.

537
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:06,630
Let's go, Akdong Cross!

538
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:33,160
[Ring Ding Dong - SHINee]

539
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,440
Miss, oh young lady
I'm pure Chan-hyuk

540
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,430
I may look like I'm in grade school
You're the girl I'm dreaming about

541
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:10,890
Come to me
I paved the road that leads to me

542
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,390
The way you eat and sleep looks cute
That's how deep my heart is for you

543
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:12,270
That was SHINee's "Ring Ding Dong"
and SHINee is with the audience.

544
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:17,650
No. 8 Akdong Musician gave
off their acoustic charm.

545
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:21,490
Both teams put on a
stage full of character.

546
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:28,950
It seems the judges were enjoying
it, but let's hear the commentary.

547
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,050
It was fitting as
the last battle.

548
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:40,440
I think this is the most
difficult for the three of us.

549
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:46,700
This was the best out of all
of 2,000 won's performances.

550
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:53,260
It was good to see you enjoy
and you had some good taste.

551
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:58,320
Akdong Musician are unique.

552
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:03,550
The lyrics and everything
are highly praised.

553
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:08,100
2,000 won, as I said earlier, even
though you go to the next round...

554
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:13,720
I enjoyed it because
I saw you enjoying it.

555
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,960
I always wanted to feel that
and I thank you for that today.

556
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:26,500
I don't know if I should say this. If I
compare Akdong Musician to a painting...

557
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:34,150
It's like a painting drawn by a kid
who digs out sweet potatoes.

558
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:37,270
- That's hard to understand.
- Right? What I mean is...

559
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:44,820
Compared to artists with a degree, studied
abroad, and influenced by many works...

560
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:49,570
Akdong Musician has one thing
those artists do not have.

561
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,940
That's why I believe many
like Akdong Musician.

562
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:57,330
They arranged "Ring Ding Dong".

563
01:06:57,330 --> 01:07:06,190
I personally think it's better for
them to sing their own songs.

564
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:11,300
They arranged it well, but
just as I said earlier...

565
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:19,180
Many will identify with a
painting by an unknown artist.

566
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,140
I enjoyed both.
Good job.

567
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:25,670
Thank you very much.
Let's hear the next.

568
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:32,080
2,000 won did the best
today. I enjoyed it.

569
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,460
I think today is
a day for rappers.

570
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,590
Il-do's rap was
the best today.

571
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:44,500
One of the lyrics was, "A seat
in the front amongst couples."

572
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:48,960
It's not easy to rap
from 4/4 to triplet.

573
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,070
I was amazed, and Hyo-bin
also sang well, but...

574
01:07:52,070 --> 01:08:00,430
It was a pity you sounded old
even though you sing well.

575
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:06,100
Bang Ye-dam and Shin Ji-hoon
sing without any habits.

576
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:11,560
It was a pity that you
sounded relatively old.

577
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:17,040
What was great about
Akdong Musician is...

578
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,580
Soo-hyun sang clearly and both
of you had a lot of energy.

579
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:30,140
I always try to catch anything
musical from your performance.

580
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:35,320
And you always taught me something.
But I had nothing to learn today.

581
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:42,220
Chord progression was normal... You
said it was the best of acoustic instruments.

582
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:46,460
But all the instruments played
how they are supposed to play.

583
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,360
It was a pity that I didn't
learn anything music-wise.

584
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,720
Thank you very much.

585
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,710
Lastly, let's listen to
BoA's commentary.

586
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,880
I'll start with 2,000 won.

587
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,940
Staging and your skills
on stage were great.

588
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:08,920
I liked how Il-do expressed
the rap with the dancers.

589
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:14,960
Both of you did
SISTAR's key move.

590
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,210
It was comical and good.
You had good energy.

591
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,250
But why are you always
in an unfavorable pool?

592
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:31,150
Akdong Musician arranged
SHINee's "Ring Ding Dong".

593
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,390
JYP said he had
nothing to learn, but I...

594
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:43,880
It was good to hear how you
changed the melody to your style.

595
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:50,030
It should have made me
remember the original...

596
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:55,560
But I didn't remember it since
you arranged it in your style.

597
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,750
I really enjoyed
Chan-hyuk's rap.

598
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:02,950
I liked how you used the
words "ring ding dong".

599
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:06,220
Don't you run out of
breath when you sing that?

600
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:07,960
- Yes.
- Right?

601
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:10,290
It was really long.

602
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:14,500
Soo-hyun's voice was very
beautiful. I enjoyed it.

603
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:15,980
Thank you very much.

604
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:21,560
2,000 won enjoyed the stage and
Akdong Musician got mixed comments.

605
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,340
Please announce the
victor of this battle.

606
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,830
I'll go first.

607
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:33,020
The victor chosen
by YG is...

608
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,200
This round was
very hard.

609
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:42,560
- It was 51:49.
- It's neck and neck.

610
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,570
- I chose Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

611
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:51,380
They were chosen
first by YG.

612
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,590
Next is JYP.

613
01:10:53,590 --> 01:10:57,370
The victor chosen
by JYP is...

614
01:10:57,370 --> 01:11:01,580
I considered every stage
they did until now.

615
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,450
What can I look forward
to in the next round?

616
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:08,830
But today, I chose the
team that amazed me.

617
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,990
- It's 2,000 won.
- Congratulations!

618
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:15,210
This is a really
tight match.

619
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,430
BoA's choice will
decide everything.

620
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:23,530
The victor chosen
by SM is...

621
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:30,580
It was a fierce battle. 2,000 won is
continually showing improvement.

622
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:32,810
- 2,000 won...
- No, I'm explaining.

623
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:37,230
You startled me. I thought
it was 2,000 won.

624
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:43,570
Akdong Musician slowed down
but released their potential today.

625
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:50,580
It was hard since both teams
put on a great performance.

626
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,620
- I'll make the announcement.
- Is it real this time?

627
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,060
- Yes. The victor is...
- The victor is...

628
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,900
- Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

629
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:04,110
They are the last
finalist for TOP6!

630
01:12:04,110 --> 01:12:10,350
2,000 won lost but don't worry.
They still have the viewers' votes.

631
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,870
The voting will end soon.

632
01:12:13,870 --> 01:12:18,610
The final decision for TOP8
will be announced soon!

633
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:40,430
The winner of KPOP STAR
Season 2 will be...

634
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,450
Awarded a cash prize of $300,000

635
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,900
Make their first debut

636
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:51,080
And receive a mid-size and
compact premium sedan.

637
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:00,120
[Broadcast live from
Bucheon Gymnasium]

638
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,970
The voting is over.

639
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:07,690
We are waiting for the
results. Before that...

640
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,120
A great star came
to visit all of you.

641
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:16,480
Beyond Asia and to the world.
A round of applause for SHINee!

642
01:13:17,450 --> 01:13:22,240
The greatest girl
group, SISTAR19!

643
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:26,020
They're great! But
first of all, SHINee...

644
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,950
This is how your song
changed. How was it?

645
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:35,020
I feel great because they
sang our song very well.

646
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:39,620
They have good taste,
and I learned a lot.

647
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,860
And Jonghyun?

648
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:44,960
I enjoyed it and that
chord gave me the chills.

649
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,090
Show me that expression.
That's how it was.

650
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:54,060
And SISTAR19, they put
on an appealing stage.

651
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:55,710
How was it?

652
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:59,350
First, I thank them for
doing our song on stage.

653
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:02,900
If we expressed the pain of
breaking up with sorrow...

654
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:07,660
They were cool and showed a
different charm. I enjoyed it.

655
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,960
I look forward to better
performances. Thank you.

656
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,140
Many of them are
nervous right now.

657
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,120
Bora, as a senior singer,
could you cheer them up?

658
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,260
It's not over yet, so
give your all! Yeah!

659
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:23,760
Go, go, go!

660
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,850
They are finished totaling the
votes. Who made it to TOP6?

661
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:32,070
When will you
reveal it, Minho?

662
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:34,650
Please show it
to us now!

663
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,450
[Final results of TOP8]

664
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:52,470
All the TOP8 battles
are finally over.

665
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:58,000
After the fierce battle, Andrew Choi,
Shin Ji-hoon, Bang Ye-dam...

666
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,060
And Akdong Musician
advanced to TOP6.

667
01:15:01,060 --> 01:15:06,370
Unfortunately, Choi Ye-geun, YouU,
Raccoon Boys, and 2,000 won are...

668
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:09,680
Candidates for elimination.

669
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:23,890
Of the 4 teams, 1 will pass with viewers'
votes and 1 with judges' wildcard.

670
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:30,090
Of the 4 teams, which team
will advance to TOP6?

671
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:35,810
The voting results are
inside this red envelope.

672
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,050
I will announce
the finalist.

673
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:53,270
I will now announce the TOP6
finalist chosen by the viewers.

674
01:15:53,270 --> 01:16:00,890
The team with the highest votes
will advance to the next round.

675
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:02,370
It's written here.

676
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,100
Of the 4 teams, which
team will advance?

677
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:13,330
The TOP6 finalist
chosen by the viewers...

678
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,010
Is it Choi Ye-geun who
sang in her own style?

679
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:19,850
Or YouU that put
on a new stage?

680
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:24,920
Or Raccoon Boys that arranged
"Now" in a new way?

681
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,700
Or 2,000 won that
enjoyed the stage?

682
01:16:29,700 --> 01:16:33,570
Your choice is this team.

683
01:16:35,130 --> 01:16:41,530
The TOP6 finalist is...

684
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:45,370
2,000 won! Congratulations!

685
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:49,960
- Thank you.
- Congratulations!

686
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:58,470
I think they got good results
because they enjoyed the stage.

687
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:02,940
That means the viewers
also enjoyed their stage.

688
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:05,410
How do you feel
right now?

689
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:08,910
- This doesn't make sense.
- It does make sense.

690
01:17:08,910 --> 01:17:12,270
I love you!
I love all of you!

691
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:17,730
Can you describe your
feeling in one word?

692
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:20,650
I'm taken aback.

693
01:17:20,650 --> 01:17:23,160
We'll be a 2,000 won that
challenges. Thank you!

694
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:32,700
I think you got the highest votes
because the viewers were entranced.

695
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:36,940
Congratulations and join
the rest over there.

696
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,480
Only three teams remain.

697
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,850
The joy of congratulating
is only for a moment.

698
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:49,310
The viewers' votes
are now over.

699
01:17:49,310 --> 01:17:52,640
Now one team will pass
with the judges' wildcard.

700
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:59,260
The three judges... I think they
are having conflicting opinions.

701
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:05,690
It's been some time, but I don't
think they reached a decision.

702
01:18:05,690 --> 01:18:12,480
These three teams must be
nervous and trembling.

703
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:17,180
Which team will pass?
Choi Ye-geun has a hard look.

704
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,250
How do you feel?

705
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:24,830
I don't think I can
describe it in words.

706
01:18:24,830 --> 01:18:26,690
You must be very nervous.

707
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:31,500
YouU did very well and
made many improvements.

708
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,900
Raccoon Boys also
put on a great stage.

709
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:42,990
Please choose the one that will
pass with the judges' wildcard!

710
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:50,610
After our discussion, the team
that will advance to TOP6 is...

711
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:55,830
All three teams did well that we
don't want to send them away.

712
01:18:55,830 --> 01:18:59,860
I'm sure they will be talented
people in the gayo world.

713
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:02,970
But we had to choose one.

714
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:10,430
We based it on who has a
higher chance for growth.

715
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:14,500
- The last TOP6 finalist is...
- The last finalist is...

716
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:19,250
- Raccoon Boys.
- Congratulations!

717
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:29,480
Unfortunately, Choi Ye-geun and
YouU will say their farewells today.

718
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:33,410
Raccoon Boys, let's
have an interview.

719
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:37,970
- I'm nervous right now.
- It's fine. How do you feel?

720
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:42,850
I feel great and thankful.
But it was unfortunate.

721
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,850
We will do better
next time.

722
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:49,080
I think their determination will
be great. How do you feel?

723
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:51,730
I don't know. Min-suk,
help me out here.

724
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:54,080
He can't continue
because he's nervous.

725
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,550
You must look forward to the
next round. How will you prepare?

726
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:01,640
Personally, today's stage
was a little lacking.

727
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:06,820
We will put more of our colors
and improve more. Thank you.

728
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,090
Okay. Another round
of applause!

729
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:13,660
Choi Ye-geun and YouU.
Choi Ye-geun, where are you?

730
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,090
Choi Ye-geun?

731
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:18,740
You should say goodbye
to the viewers.

732
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:21,910
You showed such
individuality until now.

733
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:25,780
A word for your family and the
viewers that cheered for you.

734
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:32,320
I thank you that I was
able to make it this far.

735
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:40,680
I thank the judges for saying
good things about my arrangements.

736
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,470
I thank my family and
those that cheered for me.

737
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:47,390
Mom, dad, and big bro,
I love you guys.

738
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:53,470
Thank you. I think KPOP STAR
was a worthwhile chance.

739
01:20:53,470 --> 01:20:57,910
Think of this as a beginning.
A round of applause for her.

740
01:20:57,910 --> 01:21:01,890
And YouU... you
did very well.

741
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:06,260
You were injured along the
way, and now it's over.

742
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:11,600
Any last words?

743
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:19,260
We tried hard without regrets
and showed many things.

744
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:24,490
We feel great and thankful.
We learned a lot. Thank you.

745
01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:27,390
A round of applause
for YouU as well.

746
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:32,510
The TOP6 will have a
fiercer battle next week.

747
01:21:32,510 --> 01:21:36,060
What stage awaits
us next week?

748
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,770
KPOP STAR Season 2 will see
you next week! Thank you!

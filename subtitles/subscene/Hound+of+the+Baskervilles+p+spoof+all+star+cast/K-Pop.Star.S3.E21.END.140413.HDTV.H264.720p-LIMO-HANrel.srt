00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,110
It's the season finale
of KPOP STAR!

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,460
[From 11 cities around the world such as
the US, Europe, China and Japan]

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,890
[A big run of 8 months to find
the next K-pop star!]

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:28,530
The contestants improved more
than we imagined in Season 3.

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:37,650
We didn't drag them along. This is
a path that we will walk together.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,950
So we were very happy to
meet each and every one.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,150
There were times when
I learned from the contestants.

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:55,510
There were times when I became
passionate after seeing their passion.

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,890
[And!]

11
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:06,470
[First time ever on an audition! The winner
chooses the desired agency on the spot!]

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,250
The contestants were nervous on the stage,
but now the 3 agencies are nervous.

13
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:18,830
I was cold and pointed things out.
I think I'm at a disadvantage.

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,900
I think Antenna Music has the best
group of musicians in Korea.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,720
I'd be happy to get
such an opportunity.

16
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,810
Whether you're the winner or runner-up,
this will be your final performance.

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:43,170
I hope the two of you will do
your best. Good luck!

20
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,160
I introduce you to the TOP2
for the season finale!

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,810
The first candidate is...

22
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,400
Bernard Park who touches all
with just his voice!

23
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,220
The second candidate is...

24
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,690
Sam Kim, a soul genius who
shines the most on stage!

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,200
Give them another round of applause
for making it to the final round!

26
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,550
Glad that you're with us live.
I'm MC Jun Hyun-moo.

27
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,500
It's finally the day!

28
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,330
This show had many twists and
it was the talk of the town.

29
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,590
It is now the season finale.

30
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,800
You will be able to meet the
3rd K-pop star today.

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:25,180
Please stay tuned to find out which of
these two young men will be the winner.

32
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,830
I introduce you to the three judges
that will judge impartially today.

33
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,350
First is JYPE's Park Jin-young!

34
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,930
YGE's Yang Hyun-suk!

35
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,980
Antenna Music's You Hee-yeol!

36
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,680
- YG?
- Yes?

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:56,390
Today is the last day and I think the
judges are as nervous as these two.

38
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,840
How are you feeling?

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,230
I would like to say that it's the first time that
two men are battling in the final this season.

40
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,370
This is the moment I have anticipated
and waited for since the show started.

41
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:19,370
The winner gets to choose the desired
agency on the spot in this season.

42
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,910
Those two are nervous but we
judges are nervous as well.

43
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,660
You three don't look
so good today.

44
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,480
It's the first time ever on an audition
for the winner to choose on the spot.

45
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,980
JYP, please say something so that
the winner can choose carefully.

46
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,930
Choosing an agency is
very important, so...

47
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,200
Forget all of my bad commentaries and
how I coldly pointed things out.

48
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,880
- Please see me in a good light.
- He's suddenly maintaining a right image.

49
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,430
You Hee-yeol, please say something since
they're young and might be nervous.

50
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,460
Bernard and Sam are truly something to
have made it past hundreds of thousands.

51
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,840
Don't be nervous and put everything
aside since you two are the best.

52
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,960
Put on the best performance. Why don't
the audience give them a big hand?

53
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,790
Please give them a hand.

54
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,110
Many came to cheer reminding us of
the Korea-Japan soccer match.

55
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,410
I have something to ask
before we start.

56
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,110
I heard that the two of you are
the closest out of all the contestants.

57
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,700
Sam, have you ever thought of
facing each other in the final?

58
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,120
- I never expected it.
- You never expected it.

59
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:56,690
I still can't believe
that I'm actually here.

60
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,520
I'm grateful to the judges and fans
that allowed me to make it this far.

61
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,790
I'm happy to be here
with Bernard as well.

62
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,760
Alright. And you, Bernard?

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:16,390
I never knew I'd make it this far.

64
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:25,070
I'm happy to be in the final
with my closest friend.

65
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,410
Bernard, who do you
think will win?

66
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,650
I'm not sure but
I'll do my best.

67
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,770
What do you think, Sam?

68
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,420
Speak into the mike.

69
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,410
I don't know either
but I'll do my best.

70
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,510
That's different from what
you said in the waiting room.

71
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:57,040
The winner gets $300,000 and a midsize vehicle,
and the runner-up gets a compact vehicle.

72
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,440
Please look forward to
who will be the winner.

73
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,880
I'll explain today's rules.
There will be two rounds.

74
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,250
The judges give a mission in Round 1 and
the contestants pick freely in Round 2.

75
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:23,050
The judges' score is 60% and the
real-time viewers' vote is 40%.

76
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,160
The one with the highest total
will be Season 3's winner.

77
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:37,200
Please stay tuned to find out
who will be the new K-pop star.

78
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,330
I will now announce their
number and order.

79
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,550
No. 1 Sam Kim is a musical
genius to be reckoned with.

80
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,990
No. 2 Bernard Park has a voice
that touches the sentiments.

81
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,540
Those are some cheers.

82
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:12,940
Since the final is neck and neck,
your votes are very important.

83
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,220
Yoo Hye-young will explain
how you can participate.

84
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,680
- Yoo Hye-young?
- Yes, that's me.

85
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,600
You are watching the season finale.
I'll explain how you can vote.

86
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:34,330
Text "1" or "Sam Kim" to #0606 or
"2" or "Bernard Park" on your phone.

87
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:42,060
As you know, you can vote for Sam or
Bernard but no multiple votes.

88
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,240
You can also vote via KakaoTalk
so I hope many can participate.

89
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,900
We will begin soon.
Are you ready?

number to #0606 (10 cents data charge)]

93
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,740
Your participation is crucial
since the winner is decided.

94
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,330
There are special performances prepared
other than the two contestants.

95
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:21,580
Please look forward to the performances
by this season's contestants and judges.

96
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:31,890
Season 1's winner and member of 15&,
Park Ji-min, will reveal a new song.

97
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,580
Please look forward
to that as well.

98

for the season finale.

First is Round 1 the mission stage.

102
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,090
[The judges gather to
choose a song]

103
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,050
Sam is completely different now
compared to six months ago...

104
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,250
I want him to trust his voice
and fully convey it to us.

105
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,010
[They have decided!]

106
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,660
- What is this?
- This week's mission.

107
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,720
[What mission did the
judges give Sam?]

108
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,990
<i>"Show us a performance where
you focus more on your voice."</i>

109
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,730
<i>[The judges want him to combine
his voice and amazing guitar skills]</i>

110
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,270
<i>I feel uneasy.</i>

111
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:39,540
<i>I arranged it to show my guitar skills but
they want me to show more of my voice.</i>

112
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,360
<i>I feel uneasy.</i>

113
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,650
<i>[What song did Sam choose?]</i>

114
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,200
<i>[What song made him laugh?]</i>

115
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,550
<i>Huh?</i>

116
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,060
<i>[Is it hard to predict?]</i>

117
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,900
<i>I'm burdened.</i>

118
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:13,370
<i>It's BIGBANG's "Lies."</i>

119
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:20,830
<i>BIGBANG held many concerts
and did many arrangements.</i>

120
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,330
<i>But the most difficult was "Lies."</i>

121
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,700
<i>It's hard to arrange it.</i>

122
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,260
<i>It'll be great if he does a
lyrical rendition but...</i>

123
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,970
<i>It won't be easy.</i>

124
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,660
<i>You have a video message.</i>

125
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,680
<i>From who?</i>

126
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,350
<i>[He plays it right away]</i>

127
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,960
<i>Oh! It's mom.</i>

128
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,840
<i>Even I'm nervous.</i>

129
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,670
<i>I anticipate, cry, and get excited
every time I watch your performance.</i>

130
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,380
<i>I really love you and
miss you. Bye.</i>

131
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,570
<i>It's grandma!</i>

132

<i>Do I start?</i>

133
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,490
<i>I'm so proud of you, Sam.</i>

134
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,840
<i>Everyone talks about you.</i>

135
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,870
<i>Bye, until we meet again.</i>

136
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,410
<i>This is great.</i>

137
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,380
<i>I've been having a hard time but
it was great to hear their voices.</i>

138
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:52,390
<i>I arranged it to fit my style and
to focus more on my voice.</i>

139
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,280
<i>I hope my voice will be pleasing
since I put everything into it.</i>

<i>JYP?</i>

146

<i>We gave him a mission to
focus more on his voice.</i>

147
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:06,250
<i>Sam has proven how great of a
performance he can give.</i>

148

<i>As a composer and producer...</i>

149
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:17,030
<i>We're curious of how his voice
will sound in a recording studio.</i>

150
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:25,060
<i>I don't think this was an appropriate
performance to focus on his voice.</i>

151
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:29,410
<i>We weren't able to fully
hear his voice, but...</i>

152
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:38,880
<i>We were curious of the arrangement
and it was satisfyingly amazing.</i>

<i>His arrangement was amazing

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,980
<i>It's 91!</i>

156
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,660
<i>Next is You Hee-yeol.</i>

157

<i>One good thing as I was
listening to the song...</i>

<i>All of your weaknesses are gone.
Even your fundamentals are solid.</i>

This is the final.</i>

was geared to you.</i>

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,030
<i>Let's hear YG's commentary.</i>

165
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:43,400
<i>Since BIGBANG is under YGE,
I saw it in a good light.</i>

166
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,940
<i>BIGBANG held many concerts
and did many arrangements.</i>

167
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,130
<i>I said in the clip that this is going
to be hard since it was attempted.</i>

168
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:02,160
<i>It's crucial how close or off the
arrangement is to the original.</i>

169
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,940
<i>But it was an appropriate arrangement
that was beyond my expectations.</i>

170
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,950
<i>JYP said it would be better if he did a
song that showed more of his voice.</i>

171
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>Since he already said it,
I'll say something else.</i>

172
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:27,560
<i>Vocalization and techniques
don't need to be by the book.</i>

173
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,880
<i>Every artist has a different personality.
It's important to sing well, but...</i>

174
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,170
<i>In terms of personality, I do believe
that Sam possesses his own voice.</i>

175
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,840
<i>YG's score...</i>

176
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,660
<i>He complimented on the
arrangement. The score is...</i>

177
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,010
<i>It's 94!</i>

178
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,370
<i>He has 278!</i>

179
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:56,200
<i>Those cheering for Sam Kim can
text "1" or "Sam Kim" to #0606.</i>

180
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,830
<i>Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.</i>

181
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,480
<i>This stage was by
No. 1 Sam Kim!</i>

182
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,370
<i>[What do the judges want
to see from Bernard?]</i>

183
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,460
<i>I want him to sing
an actual gayo.</i>

184
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,600
<i>Some viewers thirst for Bernard.</i>

185
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,500
<i>I absolutely want to see him
overcome that, at least in the final.</i>

186
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,600
<i>Me too.</i>

187
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,730
<i>[What is Bernard's fate?]</i>

188
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,200
<i>[He gets the judges' mission
the following day...]</i>

189
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,200
<i>"Sing with a gayo sentiment
naturally as if speaking."</i>

190
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,020
<i>[Deep in thought...]</i>

191
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,130
<i>[What will he choose?]</i>

192
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,360
<i>[He gets Bernard's choice]</i>

193
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,210
<i>He'll win if he does well.</i>

194
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,550
<i>These two...</i>

195
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,350
<i>They're pros at choosing now
since this is the final.</i>

196
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,550
<i>[What song did he choose?]</i>

197
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:19,150
<i>It's Yoo Jae-ha's
"Because I Love You."</i>

198
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:25,420
<i>Bernard can put his emotions
into this gayo at least.</i>

199
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,920
<i>But it's really difficult.
He's going head on.</i>

200
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:39,510
<i>If I'm to sing as if speaking, I heard
Yoo Jae-ha was the best in Korea.</i>

201
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,960
<i>I liked it as I kept
listening to his songs.</i>

202
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,620
<i>I wanted to sing this in the final
even before I got my mission.</i>

203
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,370
<i>Even though I practice...</i>

204
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:07,630
<i>I have to try to understand
the lyrics of the song.</i>

205
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,530
<i>I listened to it all day.</i>

206
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:18,740
<i>I read the lyrics as I listened and
thought about it to make it mine.</i>

207
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,280
<i>I'm trying to make it as
close as the original.</i>

208
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,070
<i>[Because I Love You - Yoo Jae-ha]</i>

209
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:37,550
<i>Bernard went head on
by singing a gayo.</i>

210
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,380
<i>He sang "Because I Love You"
as the song for his mission.</i>

211
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:48,110
<i>What commentaries will the
judges make for him?</i>

212
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,570
<i>You Hee-yeol?</i>

213
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,660
<i>Bernard can sing gayo now.</i>

214
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,890
<i>But...</i>

215
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,200
<i>The final is interesting
and amazing.</i>

216
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,750
<i>I thought it was game over
when he started singing.</i>

217
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,740
<i>But?</i>

218
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,490
<i>He made a mistake in the
lyrics towards the end.</i>

219
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,570
<i>Then he missed his breathing.</i>

220
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,490
<i>The outcome became questionable.</i>

221
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,060
<i>But you sang gayo very well.</i>

222
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,550
<i>Antenna Music's score...</i>

223
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:39,460
<i>He sang gayo well but made
mistakes. What is the score?</i>

224
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,490
<i>It's 95!</i>

225
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,230
<i>Next is JYP.</i>

226
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,450
<i>It's hard to hide how much a person
practiced or put effort into it.</i>

227
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,870
<i>As I saw him sing...</i>

228
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:05,380
<i>I could see how much thought
he put into it and practiced.</i>

229
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,380
<i>That was great but...</i>

230
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,400
<i>Now I have assurance that
you can sing gayo well.</i>

231
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,690
<i>But just as You Hee-yeol said...</i>

232
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,240
<i>But you broke down quickly
after making a mistake.</i>

233
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,530
<i>That lowered your score.</i>

234
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,930
<i>JYP's score...</i>

235
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,810
<i>The final is making him nervous.
He made mistakes but...</i>

236
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,600
<i>It's 95!</i>

237
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,570
<i>That mistake was a pity. YG?</i>

238
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:45,940
<i>This is an important round,
but he can make mistakes.</i>

239
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,930
<i>He could get the lyrics
wrong because...</i>

240
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,500
<i>That can happen if he's
really into the feeling...</i>

241
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,890
<i>And also because he's not
good in Korean yet.</i>

242
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:04,780
<i>When he sang the first measure...
I always compared him to a heavyweight.</i>

243
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:10,500
<i>Sam is sitting there but I thought,
"Sam needs to be careful today."</i>

244
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,740
<i>This heavyweight removed his gloves.</i>

245
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,920
<i>There's a chance for Sam to get
KO'd if he gets hit by that.</i>

246
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,690
<i>I thought Sam should avoid well in
Round 2 since this is Round 1.</i>

247
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:30,700
<i>It's a pity due to the mistake
since you could have gotten 100.</i>

248
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,100
<i>YG's score...</i>

249
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,930
<i>Both Sam and Bernard's
flushed faces are memorable.</i>

250
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,160
<i>It's 96!</i>

251
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,560
<i>He has 286 and taking the lead!</i>

252
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,640
<i>Those cheering for Bernard Park can
text "2" or "Bernard Park" to #0606.</i>

253
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
<i>Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.</i>

254
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,750
<i>This stage was by
No. 2 Bernard Park!</i>

255
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:03,250
<i>I can see that they're enjoying it
as they appreciate the music.</i>

256
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:09,320
<i>But there's still Round 2 even though
Bernard is in the lead with 286 points.</i>

257
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:15,550
<i>Please stay tuned since there
could be a twist in Round 2.</i>

258
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,950
<i>I'll introduce the first
special stage.</i>

259
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:28,000
<i>Last week was Akdong Musician but today,
Park Ji-min prepared a special comeback.</i>

260
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,360
<i>Let's watch 15&'s comeback stage!</i>

261
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,040
<i>[Can't Hide It - 15&]</i>

262
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,360
<i>That was a great performance.</i>

263
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,000
<i>Park Ji-min used to be a contestant but
she's back on stage as a JYP artist.</i>

264
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,620
<i>Seems like there will be a storm
on the music charts again.</i>

265
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:15,240
<i>You are watching the season finale
live and now it's Round 2.</i>

266
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,300
<i>They choose their own songs.</i>

267
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,280
<i>The winner is decided after
two performances in Round 2.</i>

268
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,840
<i>A warm round of applause for
the tense two contestants!</i>

269
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,770
<i>[Sam gets into the car
and goes somewhere]</i>

270
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,100
<i>Where are we going?</i>

271
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,520
<i>Ham Chun-ho said...</i>

272
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,200
<i>Remember he'll lend you his guitar
if you make it to the final?</i>

273
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,300
<i>Yes.</i>

274
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,750
<i>[When Sam learned the guitar from
Ham Chun-ho at Antenna Music]</i>

275
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,200
<i>I'll lend you my guitar
if you make it to the final.</i>

276
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,280
<i>[That promise was made
around 2 months ago...]</i>

277
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,850
<i>There's this huge banner reading...</i>

278
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:06,450
<i>"Go to the final with
Ham Chun-ho's guitar!"</i>

279
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,630
<i>I believe I'm giving my soul
by lending him my guitar.</i>

280
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,670
<i>[Sam Kim is going to
Ham Chun-ho's house]</i>

281
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,930
<i>- Congratulations!
- Thank you.</i>

282
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,040
<i>When did we last meet?</i>

283
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,580
<i>- 2 or 3 months?
- 2 months, right?</i>

284
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:29,370
<i>Your guitar skills improved
a lot during that time.</i>

285
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,710
<i>You're really enjoying the stage.</i>

286
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:39,360
<i>This guitar is different because
it has a richer sounding lows.</i>

287
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:42,680
<i>[He plays right away]</i>

288
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,200
<i>- I like the feel.
- I know, right?</i>

289
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,860
<i>[Ham Chun-ho's guitar will be
with him at the final stage]</i>

290
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,810
<i>You have to be the winner
when you return this.</i>

291
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,380
<i>Do your best and enjoy it.
Looking forward to a good result.</i>

292
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,820
<i>I have the strength to practice
since he lent me a great guitar.</i>

293
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,610
<i>This is HIS guitar...</i>

294
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:15,400
<i>So I have this responsibility
to do well with his guitar.</i>

295
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,810
<i>[What is Sam's final song?]</i>

296
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,380
<i>How does Sam know this song?</i>

297
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,850
<i>This was unexpected.</i>

298
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:32,060
<i>This is an important song that
could determine his victory.</i>

299
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:42,370
<i>It's Sting's "Englishman in New York."</i>

300
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,340
<i>It's a risk.</i>

301
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,640
<i>It's definitely a risk.</i>

302
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,760
<i>Sam has to be more detailed
unlike his energetic style.</i>

303
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,280
<i>I've been complimented
until now for fast songs.</i>

304
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,510
<i>I wanted to be recognized for
a different style of song.</i>

305
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:09,740
<i>I've been playing fast but
this one will be soft.</i>

306
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:17,960
<i>I've practiced hard and I'm going on
stage with Ham Chun-ho's guitar.</i>

307
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,400
<i>I want it to be great.</i>

308
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,530
<i>Thank you, Ham Chun-ho!</i>

309
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:56,800
<i>Sam Kim's groove is back!</i>

310
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,580
<i>Sam Kim was somewhat
tense and flushed but...</i>

311
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:08,280
<i>He showed his talented groove
and sprang back to life.</i>

312
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:11,670
<i>JYP can't seem to close his mouth.</i>

313
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:19,820
<i>I'm saying this a second time
but Sam was crazy in this song.</i>

314
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:31,000
<i>The three of us made eye contact
when he started playing the guitar.</i>

315
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,080
<i>How did he even think of starting
with such a playing style?</i>

316
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,030
<i>It was an unexpected style.</i>

317
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,150
<i>The other thing is the lyrics.
Sting is an Englishman.</i>

318
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:50,580
<i>"It was awkward being in the US
but 'be yourself.' I'll act myself."</i>

319
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,190
<i>"I'm an Englishman in New York but I'll be
myself." He was just like the lyrics.</i>

320
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:03,360
<i>"I'm a stranger in Korea but I'll
be myself." And he did just that.</i>

321
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:10,080
<i>It was hard to take off
points. JYP's score...</i>

322
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,240
<i>Sam Kim gets the highest score
when he's recognized for who he is.</i>

323
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,360
<i>It's 99!</i>

324
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,760
<i>It's the highest score so far.</i>

325
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,010
<i>I think he found his pace.
Who's going next?</i>

326
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,230
<i>YG?</i>

327
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:33,440
<i>Sam Kim made a difficult choice in
Round 1 by doing BIGBANG's "Lies."</i>

328
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,830
<i>I was really worried in this round
because he chose Sting's song.</i>

329
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:42,490
<i>Since he sang a style
he never sang before.</i>

330
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,420
<i>I've danced for years.</i>

331
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:55,160
<i>It's hard to do a slow dance than a fast one,
and the same thing goes for rapping.</i>

332
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,660
<i>There's nothing more to expect
from Sam's performance now.</i>

333
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,620
<i>Nothing more?</i>

334
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:11,530
<i>It was such an amazing performance that
I'd like to give more points if I could.</i>

335
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:18,110
<i>I think Sting would be pleased
if he happens to watch this.</i>

336
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,710
<i>YG's score...</i>

337
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:25,220
<i>He said he wanted to give more.
What is the score?</i>

338
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,690
<i>It's 100!</i>

339
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,030
<i>Ain't that something?</i>

340
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,480
<i>He was a little tense in Round 1
but he regained his smile.</i>

341
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,550
<i>The outcome is unpredictable.
You Hee-yeol is next.</i>

342
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,700
<i>I remembered when I first met
Sam as I listened to this.</i>

343
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,990
<i>He was playing the guitar and
we, the judges, were amazed.</i>

344
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:52,660
<i>Then 6-7 months passed...</i>

345
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:58,890
<i>But such an arrangement can't
be done by a 16 or 17-year-old.</i>

346
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:03,520
<i>Even pro musicians can't do this.</i>

347
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:11,410
<i>His voice and all that doesn't matter
because Sam is really really good.</i>

348
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,300
<i>Compliments one after another.</i>

349
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:19,380
<i>It seems my commentaries for this
performance are just additions.</i>

350
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,400
<i>Sam, it was the best ever!</i>

351
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,080
<i>Antenna Music's score...</i>

352
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:30,170
<i>What is the score after
all those compliments?</i>

353
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:32,080
<i>It's 100!</i>

354
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:40,310
<i>He has 299 and finished Round 2
by springing back to life!</i>

355
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:47,520
<i>Those cheering for Sam Kim can
text "1" or "Sam Kim" to #0606.</i>

<i>Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.</i>

357
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,190
<i>This stage was by
No. 1 Sam Kim!</i>

358
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:01,660
<i>[One day, with the final ahead]</i>

359
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,580
<i>Is there somewhere you wanted
to go when you came to Korea?</i>

360
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:09,500
<i>I wanted to go to the beach.</i>

361
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,690
<i>[A short trip for Bernard
before the final]</i>

362
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:21,440
<i>I went to the beach a lot with my family
as a kid when I first came to Korea.</i>

363
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,250
<i>I swam a lot and we gathered
clams that we ate at home.</i>

364
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,410
<i>That's why I wanted to go to
the beach again when I came.</i>

365
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:38,010
<i>[The beach holds many memories
and he's back as an adult]</i>

366
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,330
<i>I came to Korea for my dreams but
didn't have time due to practice.</i>

367
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:51,370
<i>I felt great to be out
of the practice room.</i>

368
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,000
<i>[It was a significant time
even though it was short]</i>

369
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:58,410
<i>[What is his final song?]</i>

370
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,850
<i>This song...</i>

371
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:09,670
<i>He knew he would make it to the final
and intentionally saved this, right?</i>

372
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,090
<i>[R. Kelly's "I Believe I Can Fly"]</i>

373
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:23,890
<i>It feels like he brought this out
to deliver his sunday punch.</i>

374
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:26,660
<i>Just a graze from this
punch will kill you.</i>

375
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>This song is saying that your dreams
will come true if you believe in yourself.</i>

376
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:37,430
<i>All of us are on this show
because of our dreams.</i>

377
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:41,800
<i>It fits my situation...</i>

378
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,620
<i>I have to believe in myself to make it
come true so I chose this song.</i>

379
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,020
<i>- What does it mean?
- I'm going to be first.</i>

380
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,240
<i>How do you feel as this is
your last interview?</i>

381
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,630
<i>My last interview...</i>

382
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:12,600
<i>I feel sad that this show
is going to end now.</i>

383
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:16,690
<i>I like being on stage.</i>

384
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:23,860
<i>I just wanted to be in the TOP10
when I came to Korea.</i>

385
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,750
<i>I'm thankful to those
cheering for me.</i>

386
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:40,930
<i>I want to stand on such stages if
I'm going to be a singer in Korea.</i>

387
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:43,770
<i>This stage was by Bernard the angel
as if he was going to ascend.</i>

388
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:50,880
<i>This was his second song, but it's
hard to tell what the judges thought.</i>

389
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,390
<i>What are their commentaries?
You Hee-yeol is first.</i>

390
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,610
<i>I was curious of how
he would sing this...</i>

391
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:05,150
<i>Since I thought it was
the perfect song for him.</i>

392
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:11,770
<i>Your voice is hoarse
from practice, right?</i>

393
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,650
<i>He said it is.</i>

394
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:20,270
<i>Your greatest charm is what JYP said
and that's half air, half sound.</i>

395
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:28,990
<i>The substance is enveloped with air
as if your voice is coated.</i>

396
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:33,530
<i>You start to strain because
your voice is hoarse.</i>

397
00:52:33,530 --> 00:52:38,380
<i>It's as if that coated air
became volatile.</i>

398
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,890
<i>It's a pity that you couldn't
fully show this song's charm.</i>

399
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:45,680
<i>But...</i>

400
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,450
<i>- Bernard is still the best.
- He's still the best.</i>

401
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:50,670
<i>Antenna Music's score...</i>

402
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,110
<i>He didn't fully show his
skills but he's the best...</i>

403
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:59,010
<i>It's 97! That's a high score.</i>

404
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:02,330
<i>Next is JYP.</i>

405
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:11,060
<i>It was like a scam when I heard
that he's singing this song.</i>

406
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:17,530
<i>I thought he would put on his best
performance since it's like a foul.</i>

407
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:21,830
<i>But when he started singing,
it wasn't his voice.</i>

408
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:25,300
<i>Half of his voice was gone.</i>

409
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,430
<i>I was thinking, "What's going on?"</i>

410
00:53:28,430 --> 00:53:32,790
<i>He couldn't focus on the feeling
because he couldn't control his voice.</i>

411
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:35,600
<i>No matter how well he sings...</i>

412
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,860
<i>He can't throw that sunday punch
if he's not connected to the feeling.</i>

413
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:46,730
<i>I don't know what happened to his voice
but this wasn't his best performance.</i>

414
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:51,470
<i>It's a pity but just as
You Hee-yeol said...</i>

415
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:54,650
<i>Your voice is still there.
JYP's score...</i>

416
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:59,890
<i>His voice was great but the feeling
was a pity. What is the score?</i>

417
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:02,270
<i>It's 95!</i>

418
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,710
<i>Next is YG.</i>

419
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,240
<i>I thought it would've been better
if the order was switched.</i>

420
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:18,570
<i>I think he wouldn't have made mistakes
if he had sung this song first.</i>

421
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:25,580
<i>I didn't say it in the clip but I was
worried when you chose this song.</i>

422
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:34,030
<i>You have an R&B tone to your voice but
your singing is different from black artists.</i>

423
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:38,640
<i>That's why you exploded when
you sang Richard Marx's song.</i>

424
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:47,940
<i>The distinct nasal bending of
black artists is important in this song.</i>

425
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,710
<i>I was worried about how
you will sing this.</i>

426
00:54:52,710 --> 00:55:00,490
<i>Since you gave many moving performances,
this one didn't meet my expectations.</i>

427
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:01,720
<i>YG's score...</i>

428
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:07,020
<i>Let's see the score.

429
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,270
<i>It's 95!</i>

430
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,860
<i>He has 287!</i>

431
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:19,480

<i>It's time for the second
special stage.</i>

437
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:43,700
<i>JYP and You Hee-yeol were always
judging but they left their seats.</i>

438
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:49,630
<i>They prepared a special stage.
Let me ask YG. What is it?</i>

439
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:59,070
<i>JYP and You Hee-yeol are doing a
collaboration with the contestants.</i>

440
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:03,400
<i>I don't know what
they are doing but...</i>

441
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:11,590
<i>Since JYP pointed out many
things for the contestants...</i>

442
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:18,040
<i>I'll be objective and observe
what to point out for JYP.</i>

443
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,600
<i>He was always judging but
now he's on the stage.</i>

444
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,100

<i>If the contestants I met on this show
still have the same love for music...</i>

450
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,320
<i>We will definitely meet someday.</i>

451
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:56,810
<i>Is there someone you would
especially like to perform with?</i>

452
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:58,440
<i>Yes.</i>

453
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,430
<i>It's the one who's in
my heart this season.</i>

<i>[During the battle audition when
he saw Hong Jung-hee off]</i>

455
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,800
<i>As we practiced, we will meet someday
playing the piano and singing.</i>

456
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:25,270
<i>I'll be playing the piano then.
Promise to meet again.</i>

457
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:27,020

<i>That was a joint performance
between teacher and student.</i>

462
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,870
<i>It was a great performance between
the judges and the contestants.</i>

463
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:27,850
<i>Many must have wanted to see
that last performance.</i>

464
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,640
<i>You Hee-yeol kept his promise with
Hong Jung-hee. It was moving.</i>

465
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:37,850
<i>The collaboration between JYP and
the main contestants was memorable.</i>

466
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:45,910
<i>It must have been emotional since
you sang songs that they sang.</i>

467
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:53,660
<i>It was an honor since they sang well and
it was more exciting singing together.</i>

468
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:57,170
<i>I see. Many sang JYP's songs.</i>

469
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:02,940
<i>YG, you were watching with pleasure.
Could you give an impartial commentary?</i>

470
01:09:05,540 --> 01:09:08,800
<i>You Hee-yeol's performance...</i>

471
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:14,600
<i>Shows how much affection a
producer has for the singer.</i>

472
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,500
<i>In other words...</i>

473
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:24,340
<i>I dare say that his ability drew out the
best performance from Hong Jung-hee.</i>

474
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:25,520
<i>I see.</i>

475
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,850
<i>I'm going to criticize
JYP's performance.</i>

476
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:34,360
<i>He didn't sing from the start.</i>

477
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,330
<i>I thought he was avoiding it but
suddenly let out an eerie shriek.</i>

478
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:41,280
<i>- Don't you mean falsetto?
- No, it was an eerie shriek.</i>

479
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,000

<i>Sam, what do you think?</i>

564
01:21:37,170 --> 01:21:39,630
<i>- It's definitely Bernard.
- Definitely Bernard?</i>

565
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:45,270
<i>But you were complimented
and got 299 in Round 2.</i>

566
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:46,980
<i>We don't know the outcome.</i>

you did well in Round 2.</i>

569

<i>Then you could be the winner.</i>

570
01:21:55,130 --> 01:22:00,980
<i>But I think he's more qualified
since he did both rounds well.</i>

571
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:07,480
<i>You think he did better.
What do you think, Bernard?</i>

572
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:11,920
<i>How can I beat 299?</i>

573
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,940
<i>Is he telling the truth
or making a fuss?</i>

574

<i>According to the judges' score,
Sam is in the lead by 4.</i>

<i>This is the last time
I'm holding this mike.</i>

579

580
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:47,970
<i>I think about the happiest moments
since I'm in my mid-40s now.</i>

581
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:55,020
<i>What's important is who was I with
rather than what did I do.</i>

582
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:04,130
<i>The contestants met the 3 judges
who are difficult to meet.</i>

583
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:07,360
<i>They also became close to one
another as they lodged.</i>

584
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:10,940
<i>They're waiting for the
announcement but...</i>

585
01:23:10,940 --> 01:23:20,310
<i>I think they're all winners with
great memories made in their youth.</i>

586

<i>I congratulate the winner and hope
they gladly accept the outcome.</i>

587
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,110
<i>Alright.</i>

588
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:32,380

<i>Any words from You Hee-yeol?</i>

593
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:53,070
<i>They had hard times
lodging together.</i>

594
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:56,410
<i>Now you can eat
whatever you want.</i>

595
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,830

<i>Whose name do you think
is in this envelope?</i>

01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:37,960
<i>I saw the name.</i>

602
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:46,300

611
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:30,540
<i>He's being congratulated by Sam
but he looks bewildered.</i>

612
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,830
<i>His knees are feeling weak.</i>

613
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,620
<i>Would both Bernard and Sam
step forward please?</i>

614
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:48,810

you want to your heart's content.</i>

<i>Thank you.</i>

621
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:28,780
<i>Sam, you were complimented in
Round 2 that it was the best.</i>

622
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:30,960
<i>Wasn't it a pity?
How do you feel?</i>

623
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,980
<i>It would have been better
if I did better in Round 1.</i>

624
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:40,790
<i>But it's good and it's
great that he won.</i>

625
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:54,880

you sang "Lies" in Round 1?</i>

626

627

I had fun and it was an honor.</i>

<i>Alright.</i>

630
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:16,760
<i>Bernard is the winner
but it isn't over.</i>

631
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:24,750
<i>Now the 3 judges have to
wait for Bernard's choice.</i>

632
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:33,180
<i>Who did Bernard choose between
JYP, YG, and You Hee-yeol?</i>

633
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:39,410
<i>Did you already decide?</i>

634
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:42,590
<i>Yes. It was hard but
I already decided.</i>

635
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:46,840

already chose. Alright.</i>

639
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:13,100
<i>The contestants were
nervous on stage.</i>

640
01:28:13,100 --> 01:28:15,920
<i>But this is the moment when
the 3 agencies are nervous.</i>

641
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,500
<i>I'm scared and afraid
but I have the desire.</i>

642
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:25,290
<i>There are contestants we like but
we'll have our eyes on the winner.</i>

643
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:28,450
<i>[Which agency will the
winner choose?]</i>

644
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:34,660
<i>[The winner's final choice]</i>

645
01:28:34,660 --> 01:28:38,560
<i>Bernard is weak in the knees
and is tottering right now.</i>

646
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:46,100
<i>He's still overwhelmed
but I think he's decided.</i>

647
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:52,020
<i>I'll give each agency
some time to appeal to him.</i>

648
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:57,750
<i>What is JYPE like? Please
say something briefly.</i>

649
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:02,560
<i>The owner of JYPE
is a Beraholic.</i>

650
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,080
<i>The owner is a Beraholic.</i>

651
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,430
<i>- That's all I have to say.
- That's too much. YG?</i>

652
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:18,620
<i>Akdong Musician debuted and
are taking first right now.</i>

653
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:22,110
<i>You have to choose your
career path wisely.</i>

654
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,240
<i>YG, you...</i>

655
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:30,150
<i>I'll use every means possible to
make you first if you choose YGE.</i>

656
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:35,200
<i>You'll make him into the lord of cheers.
That was an obvious sign of affection.</i>

657
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:36,880
<i>You Hee-yeol?</i>

658
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,880
<i>Have you heard of the
tyranny of major companies?</i>

659
01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:45,980
<i>You are thrown out if
you are not first.</i>

660
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:52,520
<i>But we are like a family that
will walk together to the end.</i>

661
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,640
<i>- Come to Antenna Music.
- Antenna Music, alright.</i>

662
01:29:55,640 --> 01:30:02,510
<i>The judges were just appealing to him.
Bernard will choose carefully.</i>

663
01:30:02,510 --> 01:30:08,310
<i>Is it YGE, JYPE, or Antenna Music?</i>

664
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,180
<i>In which agency is his
heart bound? Please tell us!</i>

665
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:22,330
<i>He's beating around the bush.</i>

666
01:30:22,330 --> 01:30:27,050
<i>That's good. They should also
experience how this feels.</i>

667
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:35,670
<i>He's still beating around the bush.
That's it Bernard! Keep at it!</i>

668
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,300
<i>Bernard's choice is...</i>

669
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,640
<i>I choose...</i>

670
01:30:45,570 --> 01:30:50,410
<i>Congratulations JYP!</i>

671
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:59,800
<i>The original Beraholic was
choosen by Bernard.</i>

672
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:11,220
<i>JYP is the head of the agency that
will make a contract with the winner.</i>

673
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:16,130
<i>Congratulations!
JYP is really happy.</i>

674
01:31:16,130 --> 01:31:19,160
<i>Your thoughts, JYP?</i>

675
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:25,010
<i>It's an honor and I'll do my
best to be a good supporter.</i>

676
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:28,380
<i>Bernard wasn't always first.</i>

677
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,310
<i>He was a candidate for elimination
many times but overcame them.</i>

678
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:35,280
<i>I'm proud that he made it.</i>

679
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:39,430
<i>We'll do well together.
Thank you.</i>

680
01:31:39,430 --> 01:31:46,230
<i>The other two judges might be sulking
but come down and let's wrap this up.</i>

681
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:50,910
<i>Why did you choose JYP?</i>

682
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:57,620
<i>I still have many
things to learn.</i>

683
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:05,600
<i>I think JYP is the one who
will teach me the best.</i>

684
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,390
<i>I pray that you made
the best choice.</i>

685
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:15,970
<i>Do the other judges have anything
to say? YG? You look bitter.</i>

686
01:32:15,970 --> 01:32:18,200
<i>I'll say one thing.</i>

687
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:20,060
<i>You'll regret it.</i>

688
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,590
<i>Bernard?</i>

689
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:31,380
<i>You're going to suffer.</i>

690
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,920
<i>But you found the
best teacher.</i>

691
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:37,360
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

692
01:32:39,710 --> 01:32:46,630
<i>Season 3's winner is Bernard Park
and he chose JYP as his agency.</i>

693
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:52,990
<i>This ends KPOP STAR
Season 3's long run.</i>

694
01:32:52,990 --> 01:33:00,350
<i>We congratulate Bernard on taking his
first step as a pro singer with JYP.</i>

695
01:33:00,350 --> 01:33:05,080
<i>Please watch how he'll grow.</i>

696
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:15,890
<i>Thank you everyone for watching and
we'll be back stronger in Season 4.</i>

697
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:19,660
<i>Bernard might return then
with his debut song.</i>

698
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:21,880
<i>Goodbye everyone!</i>

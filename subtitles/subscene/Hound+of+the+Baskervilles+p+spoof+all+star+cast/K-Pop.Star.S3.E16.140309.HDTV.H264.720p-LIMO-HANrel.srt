American Idol was a
cutthroat competition.

105
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,680
KPOP STAR is a survival
but it was like school.

106
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,400
I didn't know I could improve in
singing since I stuck to a certain style.

107

I thought, "What more can
I learn or do here?"

108
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:40,010

from the heart and finding my color.

110

[What are the judges' commentaries?]

124
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,880
Heejun is a completely different style
from Bernard who just sang in Group A.

125
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:49,810
I expressed Bernard as a heavyweight.
He's heavy without minor skills.

126
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,250
But Heejun is light and...

127
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,540
He's good at throwing jabs...

128
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,700
He's detailed and good
at sidestepping.

129

that decisive blow.

We now see your sincerity and
we all know you sing well.

131
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:20,360
You need to arm yourself with another
weapon and that is that final punch.

132

Good job.

133
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:43,220
I first got into you when
you sang "I Love You."

134
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:49,710
I wrote that for Kim Jo Han
as a wedding present.

135
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,880
It's a very meaningful song
since I'm friends with him.

136
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,240
Despite the fact that it's
a meaningful song to me...

137
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,310
But when you sang it...

138
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,840
It didn't remind me of
Kim Jo Han who sings well.

139

[His rendition was excellent
than the original artist]

140

me of Kim Gun-mo.

141
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,260
As if I missed him.

142
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,170
[What's the difference?]

143
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,760
You were complimented by us
when you sang "Passing."

144
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,920
It's as if you brought that over
and substituted for this song.

145
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:40,830
I'm worried if such compliments
might have confused you.

146
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,570
You sang very carefully.

147
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,950
You're pushing out on each note
because you're being careful.

148
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,740
You don't know how it'll come out
but just sing as it comes out.

149

I thought, "What if
he sang like that?"

150

You might have had the toughest fight
on this show out of all the contestants.

You had to fight against
our prejudice.

152

All the songs you sang
since Round 1 were...

153
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,020
Gayo... even this song
by Kim Gun-mo.

154
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:41,570
As time goes by, I see that
you are optimized for gayo.

155
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:47,630
This song by Kim Gun-mo is
very hard because...

156
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,310
The notes are all up here
and none are down here.

157
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,700
It's hard to be dynamic.

158
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,490
The more I see you, I can see
how good you are at acting.

159

but I'll do my best.

173
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,510
[Bae Mina's sudden prominence
as a powerful dark horse]

174
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,390
I can't believe it!
This is like a dream!

175
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,030
[One day at her lodging]

176
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,050
[She's writing a letter
to someone]

177
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,960
I got a letter before I came here to
live with the other contestants.

178
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:13,760
One of my brothers wrote telling me
to do well and not worry since I worry.

179
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,140
But...

180
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,370
Since I'm young...

181
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,140
[She's young... and it's a
tough journey for her dream]

182
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,680
I haven't lived away
from my family.

183
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,220
Why am I crying?

184
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:44,650
[She almost forgot her "family"
due to her desperate dream]

185
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,620
I was touched after reading
that letter because...

186
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:59,400
I thought how much my brothers
are thinking about me.

187
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm burdended, "What if I do bad?
What if I disappoint them?"

188
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:20,500
My dad's coming and he hasn't
seen my performances before.

189
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
That's my biggest burden.

190
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,530
I won't worry and think
I can do well.

191
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:36,440
I'll do my best for
my family today.

192

193

[Day by Day - As One]

194
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,590
Thank you.

195
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:18,150
This stage was by Bae Mina.
She sang "Day by Day" by As One.

196
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,320
[What are the judges' commentaries?]

197
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,550
I want to compliment you
on your ad-libs.

198
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:44,160
It's hard even for R&B singers
to draw out the tension note.

199
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,530
It was impressive how you
drew out the tension notes.

200
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,220
But...

201
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:02,380
I think those that played around have
an advantage in being a singer.

202
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Those that have dated and
even broken up...

203
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:16,390
When you hear a certain lyric,
you know that feeling and use it.

204
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,820
I don't know you but if you were
just a nice girl who only studied...

205
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,980
And never had a crush, it's hard
to sing with that emotion.

206
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,800
But such things will
get better with age.

207
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,370
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

208
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:39,970
[Exceptional singing skills but
lacking in emotinal expression]

209
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,940
I'm going to say something
different from JYP.

210
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:54,770
Bae Mina and Sam Kim are the
youngest of the TOP10 finalists.

211
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,570
They're 16.

212
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:06,230
It could be impossible for a 16-year-old
to describe experiences on love.

213
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,640
Who's the top R&B
artist in Korea?

214
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,940
Female would be Lena Park and
male would be Kim Jo Han.

215
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,520
It's at the tip of
You Hee-yeol's tongue.

216
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:29,940
Even the audience judging panel
would give the same answer.

217
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,950
The number of R&B singers
we know is very small.

218
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:43,300
So I want 16-year-old Bae Mina
to develop her voices and...

219
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:52,230
I hope she could be one of Korea's
top R&B singers in a year or two.

220
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,700
You're a diamond in
the rough. You did well.

221
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,770
You have a nice timbre.

222
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,650
It's a timbre Koreans like.

223
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,420
It's when people say, "She has such
a pretty voice." It's that timbre.

224
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,570
Second, you have great
pronunciation.

225
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,890
Pronunciation isn't something
that can be taught.

226
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:31,810
It's just like when JYP says
that bending can't be taught.

227
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,740
Same goes for pronunciation
but yours is pretty.

228
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:42,490
It's because your speaking is also pretty.
Your pronunciation is pretty when you sing.

229
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:50,130
When you sing such songs or an R&B,
you have the power to sound lovely.

230
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,960
But your singing in gayo sounds
weaker than in pop because...

231
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,630
There can be only one syllable
for each note in gayo.

232
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:09,080
It's like this.

233
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,050
But pop is like this.

234
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,960
When you sing something like "sky,"
you can draw out the "E" sound.

235
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,730
But you have to do all that
with one word in Korean.

236
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:28,020
So it feels like you're playing
around with the song in pop.

237
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,400
But you don't have that
technique in gayo.

238
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,820
Once you can do that, we can feel
that you're playing with the song.

239
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,660
It was a lovely performance.

240
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,320
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

241
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,920

I think she's going to be big.

She's good at getting into the emotion
on stage and adept like a pro.

248
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,100

a big impression.

I'm singing JYP's "Behind You."

259
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:14,680
This is a sad ballad and I wore this
to try to feel more like a goddess.

260
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't really sing and I rarely sing
when I go to the karaoke with friends.

261
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:30,210
But this is the only JYP song
that I am able to sing.

262
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm saying this because
I really like this song.

263
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,760
You might get a good commentary
if you sing this one well.

264

265

[What pain did she go through?]

268
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,030
My dream was to be a singer
ever since I was young.

269
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,100
I had many opportunities
when I was younger.

270
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:11,080
I had a short two-year contract
with a small record label and...

271
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,760
I released four digital singles...

[She used to be a singer
under the stage name RAM]

273
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,720
I thought, "Am I singing on stage?
Am I singing before an audience?"

274
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,260
Singing on stage wasn't
as easy as I thought.

275
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,600
It just ended without a chance of
singing on stage as a singer.

276
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,910
Afterwards, I had fewer opportunities.

277
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,730
I even thought of quitting...
I never thought that but...

It's an amazing change that you
were able to sing those high notes.

335
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,330
I saw that potential in you
for the first time today.

336
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:42,170
Now put some feeling
into the high notes.

337
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:48,030
Don't expand your voice when
you sing the high notes.

338
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:52,010
Sing the high notes with the voice
you sing in the mid-lows.

339
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:58,790
I saw that your skills can
improve another level.

340
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,140
I enjoyed it.

341
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,410
[The compliment was meaningful since
she didn't run away at the high notes!]

342
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,050
[What about YG?]

343
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:15,200
I said earlier how I like
this song and often sing it.

344
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:23,540
I think you made a wrong choice in
choosing JYP's "Behind You."

345
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:34,690
I was looking at how you would
sing this song differently.

346
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:43,910
But it didn't go beyond my expectations.
Maybe it's due to your throat condition.

347
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:49,940
JYP says this a lot, you sang
like established singers.

348
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,030
It's because you feel
like a professional.

349
00:40:55,030 --> 00:41:04,140
We've been doing music for years.
We couldn't find anything new.

350
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,910
When we see new contestants, we think,
"Oh? They can sing it like that?"

351
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:15,360
We try to look for that. I think the
viewers will also think the same.

352
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:25,760
You're not optimized for a live stage
but you'll shine in a studio recording.

353
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:32,430
You're someone who fits the mike.

354
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:38,100
Just sing songs in that genre
without a lot of high notes.

355
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,450
The trend today in music is that
there are many songs catering to feel.

356
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:49,950
If you change that direction, there's a high chance
for you to be a singer people like nowadays.

357
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,840
I enjoyed it.

358
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,040
[Will she be able to advance to
the live show she desired?]

359
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,300
Group B is almost done.

360
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,930
[Group B's fourth contestant!]

361
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,610
[Jang Hanna's stage!]

362
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:13,990
[Jang Hanna's father,
sister, and mother]

363
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,170
She looks like Yuna Kim.

364
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,220
She looks like a figure skater.

365
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:23,990
[She's pretty]

366
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,270
How are you feeling?

367
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,290
- I'm a bit hungry.
- Hungry?

368
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,120
This is the TOP10 stage.

369
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,150
A pro shines on such a stage.

370
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,550
They do better the bigger it is.

371
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,020
Please do your best.

372
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,100
How do you feel after
becoming a TOP10 finalist?

373
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,020
I'm really nervous...

374
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:03,170
Now it hit me that the
real battle begins.

375
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,630
I'm really nervous...

376
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,550
I applied to make memories
and gain experience...

377
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:17,890
I never dreamt I would
make it this far.

378
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:25,590
It's very different from a year ago.
It's like I'm in another world.

379
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:29,950
I made a lot of progress.

380
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,620
You must be the pride
of Yangpyeong.

381
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,720
That's what everyone says.

382
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,730
The pride of Yangpyeong.

383
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:42,570
Since I grew up in
a rural area...

384
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:46,310
The county governor and
township chief would call...

385
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:50,040
And people say that they're
watching me on television.

386
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:55,990
Everyone says hi to my mom
when she goes to the market.

387
00:43:55,990 --> 00:44:01,850
She said she can't leave home.
My parents are very proud of me.

388
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,320
I think I'm being a
good daughter.

389
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,250
My sister really likes it
and she's young...

390
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,220
She likes it because her
sister is on television.

391
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:18,610
[Her family is her reliable support]

392
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:27,080
I'm thankful to the judges for all the
compliments since Round 1 but...

393
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:35,520
I think their expectations are really high
and I have to unleash my potential.

394
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,570
Every time they talk about potential,
I know what they're saying but...

395
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:46,360
I get nervous on the stage and
I always regretted my performance.

396
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,560
During practice I would think,
"What am I supposed to do?"

397
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,270
But I'm going to enjoy it
this time and show them.

398
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,870
I want it to be a performance
without any regrets.

399
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,660
[B-4, Jang Hanna]

400
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,750
[Will she be able to push aside her
regrets with today's performance?]

401
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:19,290
[Warning - Tashannie]

402
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,450
Thank you.

403
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:59,410
[She finished her intense performance]

404
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:04,890
[How did the judges see it?]

405
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,840
[JYP picks up the mike first]

406
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,460
We always said the same thing
to you in every round.

407
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:24,060
We wanted you to explode
somewhere in the middle.

408
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:32,090
And you exploded for the first time during
the rematch in choosing the TOP10 finalists.

409
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,670
You exploded again today.

410
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:38,400
But...

411
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,990
You exploded in sound
but not in emotion.

412
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,110
[Her emotions didn't explode?]

413
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:53,150
What I mean is that it felt like
you were in your right mind.

414
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:54,990
[She wasn't into the song!]

415
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:03,380
Some singers falter in their singing
because they are into their feeling.

416
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:11,310
You need those little changes
in your daily life to do that.

417
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:19,180
Those that are reserved, don't express
their feelings, and aren't moody...

418
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:25,430
It's not easy for such people to
get into that emotion in singing.

419
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:28,560
[She was pointed out for her lack
of emotional expressions...]

420
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,000
[What about YG?]

421
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,300
I saw her a little when
I casted her to YGE.

422
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,840
But she's a tomboy.

423
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:45,170
She's talkative, jokes around,
and screams with laughter.

424
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,410
Like that.

425
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,680
But why can't she explode?

426
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,730
JYP said that he wanted her to be someone
that plays around at least on stage.

427
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:01,960
But she's a nice girl.

428
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:08,780
JYP always say to just
sing half-heartedly.

429
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,880
She's a bad example of that.

430
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:21,200
What he meant by that
is to sing naturally.

431
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:25,160
- But she really...
- Sang half-heartedly?

432
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,790
But I want to compliment
you on one thing.

433
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,770
But you looked confident compared
to your previous performances.

434
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:41,170
It looked like you had
swagger and confidence.

435
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:49,350
I hope you can also sing with
confidence and sincerity.

436
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,380
- Good job.
- Thank you.

437
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,130
[There were sharp observations but
it ended with a positive commentary]

438
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:01,330
[And You Hee-yeol?]

439
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:06,430
Your clothes make you look
like a figure skater.

440
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,910
You look like Yuna Kim.

441
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:18,110
I have to talk about beauty since
I became a judge in BoA's place.

442
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,690
I'll say just one thing
about your singing.

443
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,660
Putting everything aside...

444
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:31,760
JYP mainly talks about one's
attitude on the live stage.

445
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,610
I, on the other hand, imagine
you in a recording studio.

446
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:40,770
How would you sound during
recording when you're a pro?

447
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,640
Do you know why? It's because
you're not a live stage singer.

448
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,880
- It's because you only record.
- You're on my side for the first time!

449
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,850
You always teamed up with
You Hee-yeol and made fun of me.

450
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:57,900
[Anyways]

451
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:02,080
Your strength when I think
about the recording studio...

452
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:08,180
You're the best in
the chorus part.

453
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,570
You have the power
to pull us in.

454
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:19,660
Mixing engineers increase it, double it,
and do various things to get that.

455
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,760
It's like instinct for you.
You were born with that talent.

456
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:29,430
Seeing you sing that chorus part,
I see that you truly are a singer.

457
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:30,550
I enjoyed it.

458
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:36,310
[She finishes with the
best compliment]

459
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,480
[It's hard to predict
Group B's ranking!]

460
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,920
[Group A's Bernard Park and Sam Kim
are candidates for elimination!]

461
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,620
[2 teams from Group B will be
candidates for elimination!]

462
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,080
[Who will those two be?]

463
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,600
[And later!]

464
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,450
[The audience judging panel
will start their voting!]

465
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:02,370
[Who will be eliminated?]

466
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:05,970
Now we have today's final
TOP10 performance.

467
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,970
Please welcome Something!

468
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:21,410
You are the last in Group B
among the TOP10 finalists.

469
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:25,600
The others just need to
prepare a song...

470
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,350
But it's hard for Something since
you need to write a song.

471
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:34,420
We always asked beforehand
what your song is about.

472
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,030
But we won't ask because we want to
listen today without knowing it.

473
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,970
We'll just look at the title
and wonder what it's about.

474
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:53,480
[Previously for the TOP10 match]

475
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,750
[Something barely made it to
the TOP10 after the rematch]

476
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:02,140
[After the TOP10 prematch]

477
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,490
[Everyone is bright and sharing the
joy of making it to the TOP10]

478
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,800
[Only Something looks down]

479
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,250
I felt more burdened
instead of being happy.

480
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:17,720
[They were choked with emotion since
it was harder for them to make it]

481
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:26,920
Many things happened and we didn't
really smile on stage until now.

482
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,400
And we never smiled
when we left the stage.

483
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,670
We always felt bad.

484
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:40,600
It was hard as if 10 years
had passed like that.

485
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:51,640
We met each other for the first time
on this show. It's been 3-4 months.

486
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,100
We never learned composition.

487
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,710
- For every round...
- We had to write a song.

488
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:05,630
It was overwhelming and hard.

489
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:15,730
We want to be complimented by the judges
and do a performance we won't regret.

490
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:21,970
Our song is called
"21st Century Chameleon."

491
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:27,290
A chameleon changes color depending
on its environment to survive.

492
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:32,940
It's about adjusting to the color of reality
and making our dreams come true.

493
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:39,510
We have to be cute and sing like
kids in the beginning part.

494
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:43,870
It's a bit awkward and
hard for me to do that.

495
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:54,640
We will show how much we improved
to be complimented by the judges.

496
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:01,860
[B-5, Something]

497
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:09,090
[21st Century Chameleon - own song]

498
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,800
We don't know anything

499
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,300
What should I be
When I grow up?

500
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,190
All I need is
My mom and dad

501
00:56:23,190 --> 00:56:25,170
That's all I need

502
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:31,500
Under "My dream" in my
Elementary school yearbook

503
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:35,180
My dream was to be president

504
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:43,210
That dark 13-year-old boy
Was like the color of the sky

505
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:49,500
But became an adult
In the gray world

506
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,310
My dream is to be a civil servant
My dream is to be an office worker

507
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,590
I'm gradually losing my color

508
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,670
I like green

509
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:07,030
But the world is gray

510
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:12,890
I hide myself again today

511
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,020
I'm a chameleon

512
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,940
I hid my longtime dream
Kept it a secret

513
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,920
I want to shout it out
I'm going to stop crying

514
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,290
Tonight is black

515
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,350
I sing in the darkness
Chameleon

516
00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:40,940
After I wake up from that long dream
I won't see you again in the morning

517
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,370
The starlight clears, the sun shines
Should I go to sleep by singing?

518
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:55,630
Although I became an adult
In this gray world

519
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,320
My dream here
I sing of my dream

520
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:03,190
I want to find my color

521
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:07,450
I like green

522
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:11,430
But the world is gray

523
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:18,390
I hide myself again today

524
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,120
I adjust my color to reality

525
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:28,100
And I hide myself

526
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,960
I live today
Even tomorrow

527
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,460
And maybe even the day after

528
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,080
I'm a chameleon

529
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:58,010
Thank you.

530
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:03,100
[They wrote a song with a new
color with an earnest heart]

531
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:05,350
This last stage was by Something.

532
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:09,840
[Will they get complimented?]

533
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:18,000
I could somewhat expect what the
lyrics would be just by the title.

534
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,330
Jung Se-woon is 18 and
Kim Ah-hyun is 23.

535
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:34,410
Those in their 20s and 30s, including
teens, should relate to your songs.

536
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,210
I'm in my 40s...

537
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:40,960
But the lyrics were childlike.

538
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:48,520
That was a pity, otherwise
it would have been a good song.

539
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:52,500
[The lyrics need more depth]

540
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,450
The lyrics were a pity and
not your performance.

541
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:57,940
- You did well.
- Thank you.

542
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,030
I like Something.

543
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:13,160
I truly do.

544
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:21,250
Lyrics such as "It's funny the clock is round"
are so good that they pierce the heart.

545
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:26,580
And I know what kind of
people you two are.

546
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:30,870
Both of you are good-hearted
with exceptional artistry.

547
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:32,370
But the problem is...

548
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:43,460
You need the ability to change
that into a 4-minute hit song.

549
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:50,670
But we have never been pulled
into the song for 4 minutes.

550
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,530
It was the same for this song.

551
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:58,660
If the two of you can
develop that...

552
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:05,720
If you can express that artistry into a
popular song or a song that moves people...

553
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:09,740
Then you can become
great composers and artists.

554
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,200
Thank you.

555
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,590
[They were pointed out for
the same thing again...]

556
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,310
I know because I trained
them for 3 weeks.

557
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:28,710
They're wandering right now
to find their way.

558
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:34,240
We know how you're searching.

559
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:43,630
You two met on this show and did
your best in collaborating.

560
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:49,770
I would like to applaud you but
some things were unfortunate.

561
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:53,370
- You did well.
- Thank you.

562
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:57,990
[A warm applause of
encouragement]

563
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:05,420
Would all 5 teams come
up to the stage?

564
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:08,490
The Top 3 will now be chosen.

565
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:12,080
[The judges discuss to
choose who passes!]

566
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:17,960
[The 5 teams from Group B
go up the stage feeling tense]

567
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:22,390
The 5 teams from Group B
are now on the stage.

568
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:31,670
They're discussing carefully to choose
the 3 that will go to the TOP8 live show.

569
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:35,020
The 2 teams that aren't called will
be candidates for elimination.

570
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:42,020
Together with the two from Group A,
the audience judging panel will vote.

571
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:48,310
1st from Group B was Heejun Han,
2nd was Bae Mina, 3rd was Nam Youngjoo...

572
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,920
4th was Jang Hanna and
5th was Something.

573
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:05,620
They are very nervous right now.

574
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,510
Are the judges finished?

575
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:10,520
[They're finished!]

576
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:22,700
Please announce which 3 teams from Group B
will advance to the TOP8 live show.

577
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,780
We expected it...

578
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,910
But it was harder than Group A.

579
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,940
We had conflicting opinions.

580
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:43,380
Our standard for choosing the Top 3 is
based only on today's performance.

581
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:54,350
The one that was pointed out the
most out of all the contestants...

582
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:59,140
That means we had a lot
of interest in you.

583
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:04,730
1st place is...

584
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:11,060
[Who is 1st place in Group B?]

585
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:16,260
Heejun Han!

586
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,330
Heejun is 1st place from Group B
and advances to the live show.

587
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:25,510
Congratulations. You take
1st place in Group B.

588
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,630
How do you feel?

589
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:30,810
Thank you.

590
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:38,310
I'll try to do a performance
worthy of being 1st place.

591
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:44,060
Speak to them in a loud voice
like a 1st place winner.

592
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,060
You're 1st place.

593
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:50,380
Next time I'll... could
you raise the mike...

594
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:54,230
[Such wits to liven up the mood!]

595
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:00,290
[Hold it yourself]

596
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,000
Thank you for picking me.

597
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,460
I'll put much thought into giving a
performance worthy of being 1st place.

598
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:09,650
Thank you.

599
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:16,350
Congratulations. To your right...
He's very conscientious...

600
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:19,350
Heejun Han takes 1st place.

601
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,220
Now I'm starting.

602
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:25,810
Now I'm getting ready to run.

603
01:05:25,810 --> 01:05:29,210
When were you TOP9?

604
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:31,700
It was exactly a year ago.

605
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:34,360
It took a year to subtract
just one number from 9.

606
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,720
You're right. To subtract
a number from 9...

607
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,760
It took a year...

608
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:42,170
It went by in a flash.

609
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:46,260
[He overcame his limits once
more as a TOP8 finalist]

610
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:50,050
[2nd place announcement!]

611
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:55,990
It was hard since there
were 3 female vocalists.

612
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:59,620
It's not easy to pick from
similar contestants.

613
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:03,270
2nd place is...

614
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:08,780
[Who takes 2nd place?]

615
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:14,940
Jang Hanna!

616
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:21,080
Jang Hanna takes 2nd place
from Group B and advances.

617
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:25,320
Hold the mike and tell
us how you feel.

618
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,510
Thank you.

619
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:30,970
[She burst out crying]

620
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:38,120
Are you crying because you didn't
expect it or you feel sorry?

621
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:45,010
I was always a disappointment
and even today...

622
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:49,010
[She had regrets and thought
she was eliminated]

623
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:57,920
I'll try harder and show you that
I can enjoy it. Thank you.

624
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,030
Jang Hanna is 2nd place.
Congratulations!

625
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,990
[She's resolved to enjoy it
on the bigger live stage]

626
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:17,890
Now we have the last one
from Group B.

627
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:23,000
Who is the last to advance?

628
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:33,540
What Jang Hanna said last played
a big role in choosing 3rd place.

629
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:36,050
She said she'll enjoy it next time.

630
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,880
This is obvious but...

631
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,610
A hard worker is better than
a gifted person and...

632
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:48,820
Someone who enjoys is
better than a hard worker.

633
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:54,850
Among the remaining 3 teams...

634
01:07:54,850 --> 01:08:00,770
It's not about who sang
or composed better.

635
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:06,160
It's about who wasn't nervous
and enjoyed this stage.

636
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:10,570
3rd place is...

637
01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:15,300
[Who is the last to advance?]

638
01:08:18,610 --> 01:08:22,660
Bae Mina!

639
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:28,160
3rd place for Group B is
Bae Mina. Congratulations!

640
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,060
How do you feel?

641
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,460
I thought I would be
4th or 5th place.

642
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:46,750
Thank you. I'll do better and
give my best. Thank you.

643
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:57,090
Heejun Han is lst, Jang Hanna is 2nd,
and Bae Mina is 3rd from Group B.

644
01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:01,320
They advance to the TOP8
live show. Congratulations!

645
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:14,100
Nam Youngjoo and Something are
candidates for elimination.

646
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:20,020
Se-woon, you aren't eliminated yet.
We don't know. We still have the votes.

647
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,090
[She keeps crying
for some reason]

648
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,310
She's out of it...

649
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,960
It was hard for them...

650
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,170
[They desperately wanted
to be in the TOP8...]

651
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,450
Something is great!

652
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,720
[They cheer them by applauding]

653
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:03,300
Was it hard?

654
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:08,990
I felt frustrated for getting
the same commentary...

655
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:17,540
[They try and try to reach that
place but are in the same spot...]

656
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,890
Something! Ah-hyun!
Don't keep your chin down.

657
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,950
Your eyes puff up when you cry.

658
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:32,450
Your nose gets bigger.

659
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,510
She might cry more.

660
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:36,520
Say that to yourself.

661
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,510
Thank you JYP.

662
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:46,580
At least she doesn't wail.

663
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:50,450
- He can't say anything.
- She doesn't cover her eyes.

664
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,400
That's right. She doesn't
press on her eyes.

665
01:10:54,730 --> 01:11:04,050
Let's have Group B's Top 3 step down
the stage. Please give them a hand.

666
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,880
Please go down the stage.

667
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:13,920
Now we'll have the two elimination
candidates from Group A on the stage.

668
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:19,860
Let's have Sam Kim and
Bernard Park on stage.

669
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:28,790
[As soon as these two appeared]

670
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:29,760
[OMG!]

671
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:32,200
[I can't believe this!]

672
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:42,300
[These two were mentioned as being
TOP3 candidates at one point!]

673
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:45,180
[Which two will make it?]

674
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:55,760
We have now finished watching them
perform the past two weeks.

675
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,930
Only 2 from these 4 teams will
advance to the TOP8 live show.

676
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:11,400
Those 2 will be chosen by votes
from the audience judging panel.

677
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,470
The 3 judges are no
longer responsible.

678
01:12:15,850 --> 01:12:22,280
Their fate now rests in the hands
of the audience judging panel.

679
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:28,200
Voting will now begin!

680
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:31,790
[The panel starts voting!]

681
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:40,090
[The remaining two are
placed on the ballots!]

682
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:44,130
[Who will the panel pick?]

683
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:47,640
[The 4 teams move to
the waiting room!]

684
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,170
[Their steps are heavier
than before!]

685
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:04,150
[They start voting as
soon as they exit!]

686
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:09,020
[They cast their vote by putting
their number into the ballots!]

687
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,940
I'm sad... really sad...

688
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:17,960
I want to say that I have no regrets
but my performance was pitiful.

689
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,860
[Bernard Park received a lot of
votes from the female members]

690
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:45,060
We won't get discouraged even
though we get eliminated...

691
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:52,240
We'll remain steadfast and
continue with our music.

692
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,050
My eyes met with my mom.

693
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:07,820
I keep thinking of
the look on her face.

694
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:22,420
[Voting is almost over]

695
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,340
[Who received the most votes?]

696
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:30,110
[The last panelist voted...]

697
01:14:30,110 --> 01:14:32,210
[Voting is over!]

698
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:36,930
[Ballot tally begins!]

699
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,630
We'll start with Sam Kim.

700
01:14:46,930 --> 01:14:50,340
[Each vote is stuck on
the wall and confirmed!]

701
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,750
Next is Bernard Park.

702
01:15:00,210 --> 01:15:05,450
[Does he have a similar
number of votes as Sam?]

703
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,480
Next is Nam Youngjoo.

704
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,540
Seven! Eight...

705
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:19,060
[Last is Something!]

706
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:23,830
Twenty! Twenty-one! Twenty-two...

707
01:15:28,890 --> 01:15:34,350
[The final number of votes will
be revealed on stage!]

708
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:37,580
[Ballot tally is finished!]

709
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,830
[They leave the waiting room
and head for the stage!]

710
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:48,480
[Who will make it and
who will leave?]

711
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:02,700
[The audience judging panel
is gone after voting...]

712
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:06,010
[The elimination candidates' family
members silently take their seats]

713
01:16:06,010 --> 01:16:08,510
[The 6 teams that passed are
on one side of the stage!]

714
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:17,980
We will now have the candidates
for elimination on stage.

715
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,280
Please enter!

716
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:23,010
[The 4 candidates enter!]

717
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:27,550
[Bernard Park, Sam Kim from Group A]

718
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:31,170
[Nam Youngjoo, Something from Group B]

719
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,530
[Just seeing them
makes them sigh...]

720
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:40,080
This is more painful than
choosing the winners.

721
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,470
It was a close match.

722
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:49,580
It'll be a pity whoever
gets eliminated.

723
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:52,080
How do you feel JYP?

724
01:16:52,080 --> 01:17:00,760
I think it's fortunate that
we didn't need to decide.

725
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:11,020
Even though we put our heads together,
we can't choose who to pass or eliminate.

726
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:22,760
It's fortunate that the panel bore that burden
since we might not have been able to.

727
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:28,140
What about you YG?

728
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:32,750
The saddest moment for me
when I was in school...

729
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:36,460
It would be graduation.

730
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:39,860
This feels like a graduation.

731
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:46,510
[Sadness in letting go of friends
they became familiar with...]

732
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,790
I already feel sad.

733
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:57,470
It will be a graduation filled with tears
whoever passes or gets eliminated.

734
01:17:57,470 --> 01:18:05,130
I will now announce the last two finalists
that will advance to the live show.

735
01:18:05,130 --> 01:18:08,850
[Announcement time!]

736
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:13,030
I have two sealed envelopes.

737
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:19,140
One of them is 1st place and
the other is 2nd place.

738
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:25,020
3rd and 4th place not in this
envelope are eliminated.

739
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:30,110
[Tremendous pressure!]

740
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,750
I'll now announce it.

741
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,140
[Announcement for 1st place!]

742
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:49,250
[The MC opens the envelope]

743
01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:03,610
[Who is 1st place?]

744
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:10,400
I'll announce it!

745
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:31,380
The first additional finalist that will advance
to the TOP8 live show next week is...

746
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:45,180
42 votes from a total of 107!

747
01:19:47,530 --> 01:19:55,030
The first additional finalist to
advance to next week's live show...

748
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:57,130
That is...

749
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,330
Congratulations!

750
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:04,510
Bernard Park!

751
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,230
[Bernard Park's older cousin]

752
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:16,060
[The others truly congratulate him]

753
01:20:16,060 --> 01:20:19,320
[Even the judges]

754
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:25,110
The 7th finalist will move to the
winners seat. Please give him a hand.

755
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:29,120
[He was in danger of getting eliminated
and miraculously sprung back to life!]

756
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:34,190
[It's as if he's worn out]

757
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,500
[He quietly holds back the tears]

758
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:51,110
We now have only one team left to
advance to the TOP8 live show.

759
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:55,050
The last ticket is in my hands.

760
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,740
I haven't opened it yet.

761
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:59,000
No one knows.

762
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,750
[Whose name is in the envelope?]

763
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:08,680
Only one from the remaining 3 teams
will advance to the live show.

764
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:14,010
I'll announce 2nd place!

765
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,720
[Whose name is written?]

766
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:32,990
Alright...

767
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:38,210
[Whose name is in the
last envelope?]

768
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:40,910
I saw the name.

769
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:49,020
I don't know who the judges expect
but the results are already out.

770
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:57,360
31 votes from a total of 107!

771
01:21:58,070 --> 01:21:59,730
That's a lot...

772
01:22:00,970 --> 01:22:05,040
That is also a lot of votes.

773
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:17,700
The last finalist to advance
to the TOP8 live show is...

774
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:23,730
[The ones not called
are eliminated!]

775
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:53,453
The last finalist to advance
to the TOP8 live show is...

776
01:22:55,021 --> 01:23:01,193
[The ones not called
are eliminated!]

777
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:08,430
Congratulations!

778
01:23:10,620 --> 01:23:13,720
Sam Kim!

779
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:21,390
Sam Kim!

780
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:27,700
[Nam Youngjoo is eliminated!]

781
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:30,180
[Something is eliminated!]

782
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:36,850
[Nam Youngjoo's mother]

783
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:42,090
[The family members of the
eliminated are sadder than anyone]

784
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:45,950
[He didn't expect it]

785
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,140
[He cries feeling sorry...]

786
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:52,580
Let's have the finalists on stage.

787
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:57,500
Including Sam Kim, we now
have all the finalists.

788
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:04,320
[The eliminated pat each
other for the good run...]

789
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:09,600
[His tears don't stop]

790
01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:12,710
He's crying...

791
01:24:12,710 --> 01:24:14,650
For the first time.

792
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,530
He was always smiling.

793
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:22,480
[He feels sad and sorry
since they shared a room]

794
01:24:24,670 --> 01:24:30,100
[The live show is right around the
corner but they have to leave...]

795
01:24:31,980 --> 01:24:35,700
[Leaving KPOP STAR...]

796
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:44,370
I was always busy
running away...

797
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:51,070
I ran away from the high notes
and played it safe on stage.

798
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:58,590
But I didn't run away today.
I truly did my best...

799
01:24:58,590 --> 01:25:05,260
I'm grateful that you recognized
that I didn't run away...

800
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:17,950
I'm grateful to have learned
not to run away when I'm on stage.

801
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:30,210
I'm truly thankful since it was an
opportunity and time I didn't deserve.

802
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:44,130
I did music alone but I thank everyone
that made me look great on stage.

803
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,800
Tune in next week for
KPOP STAR 3's live show!

804
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,390
Good-bye!

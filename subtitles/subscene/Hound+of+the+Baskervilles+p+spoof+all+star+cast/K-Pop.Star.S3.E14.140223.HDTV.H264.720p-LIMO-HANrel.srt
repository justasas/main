that star quality but...

It won't be easy for her to
compete in the TOP10 yet.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,060

while singing and dancing.

But I couldn't hear
your singing.

55

I couldn't check your singing
skills with this performance.

[The commentaries are more objective
since they're choosing TOP10 finalists]

57

But the fact of your remarkable
progress during this time...

58
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,730
I, especially, learned a lot
from the contestants.

59

60

But I saved her
with a wildcard.

63
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,860
Her performance today
was a bit lacking.

64
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,990
Since she's young... I mean, it's
incredible she made it this far.

65
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,160

was different from this.

It would've been better if we were able to
hear her singing skills or her sincerity.

68

Today's performance
was just cute.

69
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,360

so it was a pity.

[What is JYP's commentary
since he trained her?]

71

I wanted her to experience a lot
and take on difficult challenges.

72
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:46,290
I wanted that to be a help when
she later becomes a star or singer.

73

The clothes, choreography,
singing, and everything...

74

have these precious experiences.

a glimpse of her future self.

talked of as likely winners...

longest at YGE.

126

She was with our choreographers
even until last night...

127
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,480
It must have been hard for her since
the moves changed last night, right?

128
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,200
Yes.

129
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,930
She'll be going against strong
contestants in the TOP10.

130
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,350
So I went the extra mile for her
and gave the most attention.

131
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,320
I tried so she can show
something better.

132

But that may have been a burden
to her since she's young.

to practice so that was hard.

172
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,030
Thank you.

173
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,670
[The others are in awe
at her performance]

174
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:57,130
[The judges watched her proudly]

175
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,160
[What is her commentary?]

176
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,310
Since your moves got changed
yesterday, that explains a lot.

177
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:19,340
You were thinking, "Where do I
move my foot and hand?"

178
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,280
You're just singing powerfully.
Your voice was at max volume.

179
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:33,990
You have to sing comfortably and
that was what made you look great.

180
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:40,620
You were perturbed. You faltered
and just sang powerfully.

181
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,070
I thought the key
was a bit high.

182
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,050
It was high for her.

183
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:53,610
In the middle where you sang
the high notes, it sounded flat.

184
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,910
[It would have been much better
if her high notes were stable]

185
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,380
But...

186
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,710
When we first saw you...

187
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,540
We focused on your dancing but
we see your singing improving.

188
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,200
If you can sing like that
in such a short period...

189
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,390
How will you sound
in a year or two?

190
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,840
Everyone must have thought of this,
"What was I doing when I was 13?"

191
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,570
I had a runny nose and was
playing marbles and pogs.

192
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:37,870
I didn't listen to music
or even understood it.

193
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,860
But she has an open voice
and can sing powerfully.

194
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,430
Technique and experience
are all she needs now.

195
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:50,010
We saw a lot of good things.
You did very well.

196
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:52,340
- Good job.
- Thank you.

197
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,800
[She's still lacking but
also has potential]

198
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,910
[The next contestant is nervous
at the objective commentaries]

199
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,030
The second contestant makes
us to compare them...

200
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:13,570
It's Bernard Park from JYP.

201
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,520
The number one person the contestants
don't want to face is Bernard Park.

202
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,860
Second is Almeng and
third are the Shorties.

203
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,850
So it's Al, Ber, Shor.

204
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,590
[Bernard Park is a likely
winner and it's his turn]

205
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,510
[Those in the same group
are even more nervous!]

206
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:46,640
I asked those that came to Antenna Music
and the majority didn't want to face you.

207
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,090
I think you'll do really well so I said that to
get you conceited and make mistakes.

208
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,740
He's like the ace or goal getter
on the other team in soccer.

209
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,730
He has to be in a bad condition
for my team to win and move up.

210
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,710
Did you eat something bad
and have a stomachache?

211
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,470
I think I caught the cold.

212
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,920
Oh no... I was joking.

213
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,910
[You Hee-yeol was playing around
to make him feel relaxed]

214
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,700
But this song...

215
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,180
I really didn't expect this.

216
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,650
[What is it?]

217
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,560
Other songs would catch us off guard,
but this song goes beyond that...

218
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,710
I can't imagine this... Park Seung-hwa
is a member of Yurisangja.

219
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,420
It's Park Seung-hwa's
"I Love You."

220
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,770
I can't understand why
JYP chose this song.

221
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,170
When I trained Bernard,
TOP10 wasn't the goal.

222
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,910
He has to move the people
of Korea someday.

223
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,970
I wanted him to sing gayo
with gayo sentiments.

224
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,480
So I thought of the
most gayo song.

225
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,270
But...

226
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,580
I never heard of this song.

227
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:18,190
How am I supposed
to sing this?

228
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:26,360
R&B and pop songs don't have
the four steps. They just flow.

229
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,520
But gayo has the four steps and a
melody that explodes in the chorus.

230
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,970
Bernard will feel like
a fish out of water.

231
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:41,980
But this is a mountain
he needs to climb.

232
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,000
[He attempts a style
different from R&B!]

233
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,740
[He spent a lot of time in
understanding the lyrics...]

234
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,240
[Will his efforts show?]

235
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,630
[I Love You - Park Seung-hwa]

236
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:56,450
[He puts emotion into
each and every word...]

237
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:34,400
[He sings without using
any techniques]

238
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,610
[Unfamiliar style and sentiment]

239
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,130
[He overcomes another
hurdle today...]

240
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,190
[He finishes without mistakes]

241
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,410
[What are the judges'
commentaries?]

242
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,030
Should I go first?

243
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,320
[You Hee-yeol doesn't
look satisfied]

244
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,470
I...

245
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:27,180
I don't know if this is good or bad
but I see someone's strengths first.

246
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,860
[What is he trying to say?]

247
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,470
Then I see the weaknesses.
That's my style.

248
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:43,240
We all know your strengths and
complimented you a lot.

249
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,050
But I felt this for
the first time...

250
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,810
I was disappointed.

251
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,450
[That was unexpected
from You Hee-yeol!]

252
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,860
It felt like you were
like any other singer.

253
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,100
Until now, you sang clean
with standard tactics...

254
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,770
Then the techniques later on
were revealed through the song.

255
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,640
I'm not so sure when
I listened to this song.

256
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,240
I thought something would
happen later on.

257
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
I wasn't so sure since you
kept singing like that.

258
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,310
I thought, "What's going on? The
Bernard I know shines more than this."

259
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:38,720
I think it's better if you choose
a song with more emotion.

260
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,400
[Unexpected harsh criticism
from You Hee-yeol!]

261
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,130
[What about YG?]

262
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:52,510
He sang songs in English alone
in the first 3 rounds.

263
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,890
I think this is the first time
that he's singing gayo alone.

264
00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,770
I think JYP wanted him to sing
gayo and chose this song.

265
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:07,140
I understand JYP's intentions and
also agree with You Hee-yeol.

266
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:14,710
He showed many great skills and
voices in the previous rounds.

267
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,490
You just had a good voice today.

268
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:25,120
I just heard the good voice
we have known until now.

269
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:33,190
It's a pity that it was a bit boring
compared to previous rounds.

270
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,830
But you still sing well.
You did well.

271
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,370
[Bernard isn't used to
hearing such things]

272
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,460
[Harsh criticisms from two judges...]

273
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,140
[What is JYP's commentary
since he trained him?]

274
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,830
I think I have some problems as a
producer for the casting audition.

275
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,990
I didn't think of what he can do well
to advance to the next round...

276
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,560
I thought of what more he could learn,
realize his problems, and improve.

277
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:17,090
A song where he can't use
R&B techniques...

278
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,210
That's right. He can't
with this song.

279
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:26,320
A very Korean song that
he can sing honestly...

280
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,690
I wanted him to get that feeling
when he sings in Korean.

281
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,350
But...

282
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,550
The Korean sentiment and language
isn't easy as expected.

283
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:51,810
And the gayo melody isn't easy.
It was as gayo as it can be.

284
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:57,250
But I believe it was a good
attempt and you learned a lot.

285
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,390
You did well.

286
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,370

warm words of encouragement]

unexpected harsh criticisms?]

288
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:39,170
Finally, we have Heo Eun-yul
from Antenna Music.

289
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,950
It's another YG song.

290

have a meaningful smile]

291

I'm curious how she'll sing
this. I can't imagine it.

292
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,620
We're doing a dance for the first
time in Antenna Music's history.

293
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:12,800
I was eliminated once
and barely came back.

294
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,520
I thought of doing well
for this round...

295
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,390

it was mentally taxing.

- How long does she...
- About 10 days left.

303
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,350
This song didn't fit her...

304
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,050
She has to do really well since
the finalist is being chosen.

305
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:09,280
That's when she said something.

306

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,450
How can she sing like that
while doing such a dance?

338
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,680
Singing is most difficult when
moving the lower body.

339
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,000
She was continually moving her
lower body but her singing...

340
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,010
It was stable.

341
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,960
It was completely stable.

342
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,450
But...

343
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,940
I couldn't focus on your singing
because you were dancing.

344
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:25,070
I would've been absorbed if you
sang how you usually sing.

345
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,650
I'm sorry Eun-yul.

346
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:40,070
It was my mistake of wanting to make
you stand out with a performance.

347
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,620
But there's an image
you had until now.

348
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,250
Breaking out of that
itself is a success.

349
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,690
That's what I meant.

350
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,590
When I asked if you wanted to
dance, what did you say?

351
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,280
Advancing is important but...

352
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,600
I want to show various sides
and experience many things.

353
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,020
That attempt itself was good.

354
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,520
- You did well.
- Thank you.

355
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,370
Will all three come
to the stage?

356
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:24,670
[Time to announce 1st place!]

357
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,340
[All three were simultaneously
complimented and pointed out]

358
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,080
[It's not easy to tell
who will be 1st place]

359
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,730
Alright!

360
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,510
For you three in this battle...

361
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:50,650
We considered today's performance
and previous performances.

362
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:56,690
We took all of that into
account and ranked you.

363
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:04,200
The 1st place that will
advance to the TOP10 is...

364
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,270
Bernard Park from JYP.

365
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,270
Congratulations.

366
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,320
[Time to announce the eliminated!]

367
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:49,860
Unfortunately, 3rd place will
have to depart and that is...

368
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:54,490
[Who will be eliminated?]

369
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,100
Heo Eun-yul from
Antenna Music.

370
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,510
[Heo Eun-yul is eliminated]

371
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,920
It's now time to
say goodbye.

372
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,240
Any last words?

373
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:31,720
It was like a dream.

374
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,780
I just threw myself to
experience some things.

375
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,250
I experienced many good things...

376
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:46,510
My dream for music
has become clear.

377
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,960
I was able to sing before great
teachers and you judges.

378
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:59,500
And last of all, being taught by
You Hee-yeol were precious moments.

379
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,480
Thank you.

380
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:07,790
Now it's the beginning for you.
I really look forward to it.

381
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,390
- Cheer up.
- Thank you.

382
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,100
Come and visit.
I'll buy you kimbap.

383
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,350
Chae-young, get ready
for the next round.

384
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,860
I hope to see Eun-yul again.
Both of you did well.

385
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,440
- Good job.
- Thank you.

386
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,100
[Leaves the stage energetically]

387
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,100
[As soon as Chae-young enters
the 2nd place waiting room]

388
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,140
[Shock]

389
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,670
[Looks bleak...]

390
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:54,440
It's not an exaggeration to say that
the expected 1st place became 2nd.

391
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,160
I think it's going to be the most
competitive and fun round this season.

392
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,490
We'll see you soon
at the rematch.

393
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,610
[Who will take the
remaining 5 seats?]

394
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,180
Practice for the rematch
will now begin.

395
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:14,600
[Practice room prepared
for the 2nd place!]

396
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,660
[They begin practicing
for the rematch!]

397
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,780
[Everyone's busy]

398
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,700
[But Jang Hanna isn't able to
concentrate as if she's worried]

399
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:33,370
[They receive a message from
the production crew!]

400
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,430
Rematch in 30 minutes.

401
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:43,160
It's going to be
30 minutes from now.

402
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,790
- Let's go!
- Let's begin!

403
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:49,150
30 minutes!

404
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,370
Only 30 minutes left!

405
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,180
What do I do?

406
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,350
[30 minutes left!]

407
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:02,130
[As the time draws near,
they become anxious...]

408
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,070
[Tae-kyung of the Shorties
burst into tears!]

409
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,590
[Even Na-jin!]

410
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,970
[The Shorties are extremely tense
and facing the most critical time!]

411
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,080
[Tremendous pressure!]

412
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,770
[Who will make it
to the TOP10?]

413
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,580
[Practice time is over!]

414
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:32,660
We will now start the rematch.
Please enter the stage.

415
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:38,120
[They're tense as they enter!]

416
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,630
[Seeing such strong contestants
entering one after another...]

417
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,950
[They exclaim automatically!]

418
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,770
Wow! They're all outstanding!

419
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,140
[Only 5 out of the
8 teams will survive!]

420
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:09,400
Seeing all of you here, there are many
that should have went into the TOP10.

421
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:15,730
Please show us an impressive
performance without regrets.

422
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:24,510
5 already made it to the TOP10
and 5 more need to make it in.

423
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:28,940
This could be your last
on KPOP STAR.

424
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:33,640
We ask that you do your best
and put on a great performance.

425
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:41,190
Everyone, including the production
crew, will give you a big hand.

426
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,520
[Wishing them a good fight!]

427
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:47,670
First is Something.

428
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,550
[The first contestant for
the rematch is Something]

429
00:47:51,550 --> 00:48:00,910
I told You Hee-yeol over a meal that
I wanted Something to do well.

430
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:10,280
We kept in mind on the things
pointed out and made this song.

431
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,750
But it was pointed out even more.

432
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,010
I'm at a loss.

433
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:26,340
[They barely wrote a song
in every round]

434
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:34,720
[They are at a disadvantage and
feel more burdened than anyone]

435
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,380
[They just start practicing]

436
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:46,430
We're going to show everything
since we're given another chance.

437
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:52,680
[Can they overcome this crisis?]

438
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,800
[Why are the judges surprised?]

439
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,050
They couldn't write a song.
But looking at this title...

440
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:04,170
It's "Come Back Home" by
Seo Taiji and Boys.

441
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,570
[They chose "Come Back Home"
by Seo Taiji and Boys]

442
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:23,760
It's the first time they're doing
another singer's song and not theirs.

443
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,810
We look forward to how you'll sing
Seo Taiji and Boys' "Come Back Home."

444
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:36,940
[How will they sing
"Come Back Home"?]

445
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,270
[Come Back Home - Seo Taiji and Boys]

446
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,140
[They give a new feeling
and draw attention]

447
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,820
[Something's new arrangement
of "Come Back Home"]

448
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,110
[What are their commentaries?]

449
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:07,270
[Their first attempt at arranging
and not writing their own song]

450
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:10,980
[What is YG's commentary?]

451
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:21,020
I thought, "Do they have to write
their own song every round?"

452
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:34,120
They can do a singer's song one
round and their song another round.

453
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,980
It was new and I liked it.

454
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,080
It was completely new.

455
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,510
- Good job.
- Thank you.

456
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,690
I agree with YG in singing
another singer's song.

457
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:08,550
This song goes on with a bass riff
but you interpreted in your style.

458
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:13,940
There weren't any tension
or substitution chords...

459
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:21,550
But I like how you interpreted it.
I want to compliment you for that.

460
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:26,770
It was energetic compared
to your other songs.

461
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,370
- Good job.
- Thank you.

462
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,750
The next contestant is...

463
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,260
Bae Min-ah from YG.

464
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,150
[Bae Min-ah is the
second contestant]

465
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,680
[The rest are nervous because
the first contestant did well]

466
00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:57,800
You sang Keyshia Cole's song
better than I expected.

467
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,190
It's important that you sang well
but this is more important.

468
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:05,360
Don't be cautious and show your
capabilities to the fullest.

469
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,210
[But she looks more
nervous than before...]

470
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,490
[A few hours ago...]

471
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:45,510
[She was sadder than anyone
at Jung-hee's elimination]

472
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:48,790
I'll cheer you on!

473
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:52,400
You must be cold. Go in.

474
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:03,690
I honestly think that
Jung-hee did better.

475
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:13,840
I feel sorry because we were
a team the previous round.

476
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:21,820
I really feel sorry... and worried
because I need to pass again.

477
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:31,200
I don't know if I'll enjoy it
or force myself to sing.

478
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,100
[Can she get over this crisis
and amaze them again?]

479
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:49,500
[I Wanna Dance with Somebody
- Whitney Houston]

480
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,780
[Clean high notes and
amazing ad-lib]

481
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:40,770
[She's completely immersed
and enjoying herself]

482
00:57:58,430 --> 00:57:59,980
Thank you.

483
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,230
[She amazed them again]

484
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:15,000
Today must be her day.

485
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,620
[She's complimented in
every performance]

486
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,950
[The other contestants are
getting more nervous]

487
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:25,570
I really enjoyed it. I think this
will raise Season 3's standards.

488
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:33,860
This is a very critical round and
could be a consolation match.

489
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,210
It's hard to get into such groove
under these circumstances.

490
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:38,490
I compliment you for that.

491
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:41,210
- Thank you.
- One more thing...

492
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:48,540
When you sang that ad-lib,
the notes were accurate.

493
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,930
That's really hard.

494
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,860
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

495
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:57,450
[Will she advance
to the TOP10?]

496
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:03,320
Next is Complete Chae.

[The third contestant
is Complete Chae]

498
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,750
- Girls?
- Yes?

499
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,470
Just enjoy it whether
you pass or not, okay?

500
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:16,450
Yes.

501
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,920
We thought we would
definitely be 3rd place.

502
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:29,150
We will think of this as our last
and do our best and enjoy it.

confident in dancing]

[Complete Chae's performance
puts a smile on their face]

506
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:45,450
[They used to prepare singing
and dancing separately]

507
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:49,590
[Now they look natural in
singing while dancing!]

508
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,770
- That's cool!
- How do you do that?

509
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,180
Thank you.

510
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,340
[What are their commentaries?]

511
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,780
The rematch is fun.

512
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,200
- They're better here.
- I know.

513
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:49,770
Sometimes the agency's
casting is bad.

514
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,190
[That's how natural and good
their performance was]

515
01:01:54,190 --> 01:02:00,480
I honestly think it was better than
Rain's song because they were natural.

516
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:07,750
They didn't have much practice but
did something that fits their age.

517
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:12,360
They looked natural with
expressions fitting their age.

518
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,500
You did well. Your dancing, singing,
and expressions were great.

519
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,730
Thank you.

520
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:27,320
[The contestants are putting
on a good performance]

521
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:33,050
[The remaining contestants
are greatly burdened]

01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:37,820
[Who will take the
remaining 5 seats?]

523
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:43,410
The next contestant
is Nam Young-joo.

524
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:47,960
[The fourth contestant
is Nam Young-joo]

525
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,700
This round is too important
to be taking risks.

526
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,390
I'm really upset right now.

527
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,870
I'm upset that I did bad
because I was nervous.

528
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:07,100
[She blames herself for
performing bad and is upset...]

529

[Can she overcome this crisis when
she's in her worst condition?]

530

[Ordinary Woman - Lyn]

531
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:14,960
[She puts all her energy
and sings passionately]

532
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:48,080
[What is her commentary on
her passionate singing?]

533
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,360
It was as expected.

534
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,650
[Does he mean it was
good or bad?]

535
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:05,840
You didn't have much time and
your throat is in a bad condition.

536
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,900
You played it safe and
chose this song.

537
01:06:10,570 --> 01:06:16,000
You should have done such a song
in the previous round...

538
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,790
And I think you should have
taken a risk in this round.

539
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,710
You did well but
it wasn't new.

540
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:31,820
[She couldn't show anything
beyond the usual]

541
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:39,830
But I'm glad to see
the usual you.

542
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:46,780
Your best weapon is that
solid tone of yours.

543
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:50,170
I like that tone and
you're born with that.

544
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:58,060
If you do advance, we would like
to see a different image.

545
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:00,090
I enjoyed it.

546
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,880
[Will she advance
to the TOP10?]

547
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,550
They need much practice and
came to YGE. Next is the Shorties.

548
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:19,490
[But]

549
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:23,950
[Something's strange...]

550
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:28,130
Relax! Don't be nervous.

551
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:30,660
[They're very nervous
unlike other times]

552
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:35,100
[What happened to them?]

553
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:40,660
[During the battle audition]

[They unexpectedly took
2nd because of Sam]

555
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,980
[Since the Shorties were
complimented every round]

556
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,070
[They must have been especially
shocked for taking 2nd place...]

557
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,500
[But]

558
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,200
[There isn't enough time
to get the harmony!]

559
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,990
[At a loss]

560
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:04,210
[Everyone is busy practicing
the songs they decided]

561
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:09,240
[They're just getting
more nervous...]

562
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:13,070
[They finally pull themselves
together and start practicing]

563
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:20,820
[Tae-kyung suddenly
stops practicing!]

[The production crew is worried
and initiates a conversation]

565

[She's extremely nervous!]

566
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:32,560
I'm doing the highest part...

567
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:38,200
I might make mistakes since I'm discouraged.

568
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:41,860
[She's extremely nervous]

569
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:51,260
[She eventually burst into tears!]

570
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,330
[There's not enough time to
practice but the tears won't stop]

571
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,700
We don't have much time
so stop crying.

572
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:14,540
[She barely stopped crying...]

573
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:17,180
[And now Na-jin cries!]

574
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:19,630
Stop crying!

575
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,250
[They're extremely nervous]

576
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:33,740
Stop crying already!

577
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:38,670
[Their worst crisis!]

578
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,940

without a hitch?]

[Stand Up for Love - Destiny's Child]

580

losing hope in despair]

01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:35,260
[Tae-kyung's high part that
she was nervous about!]

582
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,270
Go on! Go on!

583
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,860
It's okay! You don't need
to sing the last part.

584
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:21,590
Do something about JYP!
He kept on doing this.

585
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,230
- Stop doing that!
- I'm sorry!

586
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:25,650
I ruined it. I'm sorry.

587
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:29,720
He was making pterodactyl
sounds in the middle.

588
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,890
I shouldn't be doing that.

589
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:34,790
It's the first time
I screamed like that.

590
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:40,750
[Tears of anxiety turned
into tears of relief...]

591
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:45,810
All your performances
were great but...

592
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:49,750
Remember how I said all
of you can go solo?

593
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,510
You can go solo.

594
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:57,820
All the great singers on this show
are right here in this group.

595
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:04,000
The three of you were here
with different timbres.

596
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
That's why this team is good.

597
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:13,400
We weren't able to see your individual
skills because of the harmony.

598
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:20,350
Since you were each given a part,
there are 3 main vocalists.

599
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:25,100
We were able to confirm that.
You three are really good.

600
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:33,740
It was unthinkable for me to shout
as a judge and I apologize.

601
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:37,940
I'm sorry because I can't hide
it when I like something.

602
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:44,140
What YG said was true because there
was no lead vocalist in this team.

603
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:52,120
At a certain point, I started to see
Tae-kyung as the lead vocalist.

604
01:13:52,120 --> 01:14:01,450
Then In-hye started singing
like a diva in Round 3.

605
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:05,270
I thought, "What's going on?"

606
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:08,510
Na-jin is very good at
singing the A and B parts...

607
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:13,240
But not the chorus because
she only has the upper range.

608
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:16,380
But when I saw her upfront
during the warm-up match...

609
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:18,810
I saw her breathing was wrong.

610
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:24,130
I pointed that out and she
corrected it within a week.

611
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,380
I could see how she's
single-minded...

612
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,520
In a good way.

613
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,860
They could do team battles
and have individual skills.

614
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:43,850
I think they could become the
heroines of this season's show.

615
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,990
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

616
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:50,830
[What is YG's commentary
since he trained them?]

617
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:55,120
I would've been complimented
as well if you did this song.

618
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:59,360
Fortunately, you did it.

619
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:07,590
I said, "You call yourselves a harmony
group?" That could've hurt your pride.

620
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:13,800
You took out a lot of the harmony
because you didn't have much time.

621
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:18,960
And that revealed each of your
capabilities and presence.

622
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,410
I apologize and take back
what I said that time.

623
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,370
- You did well.
- Thank you.

624
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,090
[They overcame this crisis!]

625
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,440
[They smile in relief]

626
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,800
[Will the Shorties take
one of the seats?]

627
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,130
Lee Chae-young,
please get ready.

628
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:48,220
[She steps up with a
determined look...]

629
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:52,220
I expected to take
2nd or 3rd place.

630
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,470
I'm going to do my best
for the rematch.

631
01:15:57,830 --> 01:16:02,270
I've shown only dancing but I want
to show that I can also sing.

632
01:16:02,270 --> 01:16:09,640
I want to show that I can make it to
the live show with my singing skills.

633
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:15,000
[How will it be since she's going
to compete with singing?]

634
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:20,510
[Happy - Mocca]

635
01:17:24,370 --> 01:17:30,850
[She sings a song of hope for
her 2nd attempt in 2 years]

636
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:41,010
Thank you.

637
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:45,020
[They break into applause]

638
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,540
[But]

639
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,600
[What does his look mean?]

640
01:17:54,770 --> 01:18:03,160
The melody in the beginning and middle
are in semitones except for the last part.

641
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:10,090
She sang the semitones accurately
when it's not easy at that age.

642
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:12,890
But there's one thing...

643
01:18:15,010 --> 01:18:18,340
You sing too powerfully.

644
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:22,330
You should be singing comfortably
with powerful singing occasionally.

645
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,370
You're like a radio
on max volume.

646
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:30,630
Your skills will show even when
you sing naturally and comfortably.

647
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:33,660
It's because you were
trying too hard.

648
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,900
- I enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

649
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,650
I don't have such experience...

650
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:48,580
But if my agency picked someone
and were training that person...

651
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:55,960
I would hug, compliment, and pinch
the cheeks of a trainee like her.

652
01:18:55,960 --> 01:19:00,660
But looking at her as a judge...

653
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:09,980
This is your second attempt.
Maybe that's why...

654
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:13,580
I can feel that you're
trying too hard.

655
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:16,190
[Same thing that JYP said...]

656
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:23,480
I thought it would be better
if you were a little relaxed.

657
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:29,250
It's true that she
wanted to do well.

658
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:34,800
You were complimented the most
in the previous round.

659
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,190
It's because you were the
most relaxed at that time.

660
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:45,520
Because you're only 13 and
you have to survive...

661
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:54,020
You tried to win with strength because
those before you were complimented.

662
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:59,390
I felt both proud and
pity for you.

663
01:19:59,390 --> 01:20:04,130
But I applaud you for this fresh
performance and challenge.

664
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,020
- You did well.
- Thank you.

665
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:14,540
[It's hard to predict who
will make it to the TOP10]

666
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,990
[Will Lee Chae-young
make it to the TOP10?]

667
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:21,590
Next contestant is...

668
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:28,130
It's Jang Hanna who
made my blood boil.

669
01:20:34,190 --> 01:20:36,800
[She was always pointed
out for the same thing!]

670
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,840
[Why can't she unleash
it on stage?]

671
01:20:40,830 --> 01:20:43,170
[It was tougher for her than
anyone after she took 2nd]

672
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:47,970
It's true that I was burdened
due to the high expectations...

673
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:53,060
But I feel sorry that I couldn't
meet their expectations.

674
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:00,060
[This is her hardest round...]

675
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,570
[Her long day started at dawn since
it overlapped with her entrance exam]

676
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:09,230
[There were many ups and downs
before she got up on stage]

677
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:15,250
[How will her long day end?]

678
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,900
During the remaining time...

679
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:26,480
I have to practice a song that
I'm good at and shows my color.

680
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:30,580
[It was hard but how will her
performance turn out?]

681
01:21:36,220 --> 01:21:40,420
[Give It to Me Right - Melanie Fiona]

682
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:50,990
Thank you.

683
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,350
[It was a short but
intense performance]

684
01:22:55,430 --> 01:22:58,040
[What is her commentary?]

685
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:06,710
That note is very high.

686
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,320
It was the "I don't want it" part.

687
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,480
What was the note?

688
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,550
I think it's E.

689
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:22,490
I can't sing it so
I think it is E.

690
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:27,160
But...

691
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:38,690
We've seen you get into the rhythm
naturally but for the first time...

692
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:45,500
It was a short period, but you can sing
the high notes and passionately.

693
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:47,400
I think you can do it.

694
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:54,470
YG especially said how you
made him lose his temper.

695
01:23:54,470 --> 01:24:00,100
If you sing a different song
with such high notes...

696
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:02,300
I think you can unleash it.

697
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:05,510
[The compliment she
had waited for!]

698
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:11,460
When she sang the high notes,
I thought, "That was good."

699
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:17,810
I think the judges will fall for you
if you can sing with such freshness.

700
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,780
- Good job.
- Thank you.

701
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:24,840
[She received a positive commentary
for exploding at the high notes]

702
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,190
[What is her fate?]

703
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:30,770
[The last contestant
for the rematch!]

704
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:37,410
Peter Han from Antenna Music
is the next contestant.

705
01:24:38,390 --> 01:24:40,280
[He was always with a guitar
but where is it today?]

706
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,950
[Keyboard!]

707
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:50,260
[He always played the guitar
but it's a keyboard...]

708
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:58,170
Peter always played the guitar but
it's the first time seeing a keyboard.

709
01:24:58,170 --> 01:25:05,210
I'm not that good but
I wrote a song...

710
01:25:05,210 --> 01:25:09,960
I wrote this a long time ago
and really wanted to sing it.

711
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,580
This is a song I treasure.

712
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:19,960
I only thought of doing well
while on this show.

713
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:26,130
But I want to show a music I like
and enjoy without regrets.

714
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:30,400
[He plays the keyboard
for the first time!]

715
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,900
[How will his song on
the keyboard sound?]

716
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:40,800
[Help from Above - own song]

717
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:54,640
[The song is about asking for help
from above for those in pain]

718
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:03,920
[A voice and piano melody
that soothes the heart]

719
01:27:08,550 --> 01:27:10,480
[He's given a big hand]

720
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:15,580
[But can his song take
him to the TOP10?]

721
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:32,900
It wasn't new since we heard such lyrics,
melody, and chord progression before.

722
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:36,290
But...

723
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:42,190
When you play the guitar
and the keyboard...

724
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:46,810
You have amazing musicality.

725
01:27:47,130 --> 01:27:49,190
I heard something like
this before but...

726
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:56,150
I thought it would be great if
drums and strings were added.

727
01:27:56,150 --> 01:28:01,720
Basically, you have great
musical talents.

728
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:10,540
Your starting point is to draw
that out and create your own.

729
01:28:10,540 --> 01:28:16,530
There's tremendous musical nourishment
stored up in you. I feel that every time.

730
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:21,020
[His talents were recognized but
will he make it to the TOP10?]

731
01:28:23,190 --> 01:28:29,870
All of you did well. We'll now call out
5 teams from among you that will advance.

732
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:32,950
[The judges begin the discussion
that will determine their fate!]

733
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:41,840
[The discussion is more
serious than ever...]

734
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:56,690
[Who will be the 5 finalists?]

735
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,040
[The discussion is over!]

736
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:06,370
[The judges have a long face]

737
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,110
[What was the outcome
of the discussion?]

738
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:17,010
We have the results.

739
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:27,810
We'll announce the five that
will advance to the TOP10.

740
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:33,600
We'll announce the first
TOP10 finalist.

741
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:39,520
They moved us like a
nuclear bomb.

742
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,730
Congratulations to
the Shorties!

743
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,300
Please move to the seats.

744
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,590
[They boldly move to the seats
while being congratulated!]

745
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:05,020
We've participated in many
song festivals but...

746
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:11,950
I think it's KPOP STAR that clearly
engraved the title "The Shorties."

747
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:15,430
[7 teams remain on stage!]

748
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:19,450
The second TOP10 finalist...

749
01:30:25,440 --> 01:30:31,330
We have waited all this time
for this person to unleash it.

750
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:37,850
It's Jang Hanna.

751
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:40,070
Congratulations.

752
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:44,220
[YG smiles more than anyone]

753
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:48,670
Today was a long day.

754
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:54,800
I thought I was going to be
eliminated when I took 2nd.

755
01:30:55,680 --> 01:30:58,510
[Her long day finished
with a happy ending...]

756
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:09,160
[The hot tears fall
feeling relieved]

757
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,260
[Only 3 out of the
6 teams will survive!]

758
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:26,600
The third TOP10 finalist...

759
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:40,840
Although you took 2nd place,
you were always complimented.

760
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,790
[They already have
an idea who it is]

761
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:48,840
You also received many
compliments in the rematch.

762
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:53,400
Congratulations
Bae Min-ah!

763
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:04,620
I tried out this audition
because I like singing.

764
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:11,010
Now it's the beginning. I would like to
think of KPOP STAR as my beginning.

765
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:24,230
[Only 2 seats remain!]

766
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,060
Man...

767
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:35,430
[3 teams are destined to be
eliminated from the 5!]

768
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,460
[It hurts them more since
they know the results]

769
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,840
Only 2 teams remain.

770
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,060
[Only 2 out of the
5 teams can survive!]

771
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:53,470
We'll announce the
fourth TOP10 finalist.

772
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:56,010
Actually...

773
01:32:56,010 --> 01:33:02,130
The judges' opinions differed
a little starting from here.

774
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:04,310
In other words...

775
01:33:04,310 --> 01:33:11,950
There wasn't a big difference between
those advancing and those eliminated.

776
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:21,090
The next TOP10 finalist is...

777
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:31,450
We chose the one that can give a stable
performance before a large audience.

778
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:37,070
[A contestant that can give a
stable performance would be...]

779
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:52,640
Congratulations
Nam Young-joo!

780
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:59,910
[Her best friend, Choi Rin,
is the happiest]

781
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,450
[Maybe because she wasn't satisfied with
her performance, she doesn't look bright]

782
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:18,970
[But later on...]

783
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:21,560
[She cries like a baby]

784
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:31,400
[9 finalists have been decided]

785
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,300
[Now only one can survive!]

786
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:38,780
The last TOP10 finalist...

787
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:47,050
There's no big difference whether
you advance or are eliminated.

788
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,340
The last TOP10 finalist is...

789
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,840
I'm more desperate than anyone
because I practiced for 2 years.

790
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,160
I really want to make
it to the TOP10.

791
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:15,140
I want to smile and
not cry today.

792
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,270
My mom can come to Korea
if I make it to the TOP10.

793
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:22,350
I would like to make it
for my mom.

794
01:35:22,850 --> 01:35:28,980
I hope I can just enjoy myself
while singing and dancing.

795
01:35:29,530 --> 01:35:32,440
[Just one team will survive!]

796
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:37,170
The last TOP10 finalist is...

797
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:46,550
Something. Congratulations.

798
01:35:52,090 --> 01:35:54,830
Something. Congratulations.

799
01:35:54,830 --> 01:36:01,470
[They give them a big hand
and congratulate them]

800
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,610
We're sorry for the
lacking performance.

801
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:13,980
We'll try harder to put on
a better performance.

802
01:36:13,980 --> 01:36:16,450
Thank you very much.

803
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:19,380
Congratulations. Please
move to the seats.

804
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,510
[Lee Chae-young, Complete Chae,
and Peter Han are eliminated!]

805
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:34,430
We don't think you four
are eliminated.

806
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:39,010
You are winners in our eyes.

807
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:42,470
[Peter Han was able to sing the
high notes with hard work]

808
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,570
[Lee Chae-young made remarkable
progress compared to 2 years ago]

809
01:36:47,050 --> 01:36:50,070
[The Lee sisters were able to
sing confidently on stage]

810
01:36:50,070 --> 01:36:52,090
You did great to even
have made it this far.

811
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:56,830
I think the staff here has
to give them a big hand.

812
01:36:56,830 --> 01:37:00,360
[These four receive a big hand
more than those that passed]

813
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,650
[Chae-ryeong got emotional
and burst into tears]

814
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:07,330
We promised not to cry.

815
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:13,230
[They'll soon leave the stage
they got attached to]

816
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:15,850
[The Shorties bursts into tears
at the thought of Peter leaving]

817
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:21,020
[Chae-young tries to
look spirited]

818
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,620
[The four leave the stage
with a warm applause]

819
01:37:31,140 --> 01:37:34,320
[Their families are waiting
for them at the exit]

820
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,470
Chae-young, you did great!

821
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:40,380
You're the best! Now
it's the beginning.

822
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:43,030
Cheer up! It's okay.

823
01:37:43,030 --> 01:37:47,070
You did well in the last performance.
You will always be the best in my heart.

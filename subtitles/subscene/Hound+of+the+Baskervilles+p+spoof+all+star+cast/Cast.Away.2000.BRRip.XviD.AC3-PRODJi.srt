01:47:37,790 --> 01:47:39,620
<i>She's...</i>

689
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:44,580
<i>She's... sort of lost.</i>

690
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:49,080
Maybe you could just
give her a little more time.

691
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:56,670
Anyway, uh,

692
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:58,590
I'm sorry that...

693
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:29,220
[Inaudible]

694
01:48:53,700 --> 01:48:55,520
Okay, people, let's go.

695
01:48:55,590 --> 01:48:57,760
Party's over. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

696
01:48:57,860 --> 01:49:00,280
<i>[Maynard] You're definitely
gonna have to go down to the DMV.</i>

697
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,810
Okay, Maynard, let's go.
Chuck's had a big day.

698
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,800
- I have to brief this man
on his meetings tomorrow...
- I know.

699
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,720
With the accountants
and the attorneys, all right?

700
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:09,190
I will see you
bright and early in the morning.

701
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:13,380
- Hey, Chuck, welcome home. We love you.
- Becca, I need to speak to you.

702
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:16,920
You know, Chuck, we gotta catch up
on some of that fishin', now.

703
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:18,880
Take care.

704
01:49:21,410 --> 01:49:23,750
- Good night.
- Good night.

705
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:29,060
You got everything
you need? Okay.

706
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,980
Well, if you need anything,
just sign for it,

707
01:49:31,080 --> 01:49:33,210
and I'll see you
in the morning.

708
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,970
Get some sleep, okay?
We got another big day tomorrow.

709
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:38,400
It takes a lot of paperwork
to bring back a man.

710
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,140
<i>- Bring you back to life, man.
- [Becca] Bye, Chuck.</i>

711
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,340
- Take care, now.
- Tomorrow.

712
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,550
Tomorrow we're gonna
bring you back to life.

713
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,990
How long are you
gonna be, man?

714
01:51:32,550 --> 01:51:35,040
Well...

715
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:38,080
- how long will that buy me?
- About ten minutes.

716
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:03,240
I'm awake.

717
01:52:03,370 --> 01:52:05,310
I saw your taxi drive up.

718
01:52:07,750 --> 01:52:09,570
Get in here
out of the rain.

719
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:18,500
I saw you
down at the hub today,

720
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,770
so I know you were down there.

721
01:52:38,440 --> 01:52:40,230
Let me get you a towel.

722
01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:53,540
They're sleeping.

723
01:52:57,190 --> 01:52:59,260
If you come in,
I'll make you some coffee.

724
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:14,050
It's a nice house.

725
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:15,970
Yeah, we got
a nice mortgage too.

726
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:26,020
What's your daughter's name?

727
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,540
<i>Katie.</i>

728
01:53:28,650 --> 01:53:30,470
Katie.

729
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,640
<i>- She's a beautiful little girl.
- She's a handful.</i>

730
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:52,200
Just let me get
one thing straight here.

731
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:04,870
We have a pro football team now,
but they're in Nashville?

732
01:54:07,210 --> 01:54:10,110
[Sighs, Chuckles]

733
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:15,140
Um, yeah. Oh, my God. Okay.
They used to be in Houston.

734
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:19,170
<i>First they were the Oilers,
and now they're the Titans.</i>

735
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:21,790
The Houston Oilers
are the Tennessee Titans?

736
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:23,720
Yeah.

737
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:25,640
But that's not all.

738
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:28,590
They went to the Super Bowl
last year.

739
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:31,140
<i>- And I missed that.
- You would've died. It was so exciting.</i>

740
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,590
They almost won by one yard.
One lousy yard right at the end.

741
01:54:36,970 --> 01:54:40,100
I got whole milk,
2% and nonfat.

742
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:42,340
<i>I don't have any half-and-half,
and that's what you like.</i>

743
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:45,420
That'll do fine.

744
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,070
What happened to you
becoming a professor?

745
01:55:02,030 --> 01:55:05,640
You're not
Dr. Kelly Frears-Lovett?

746
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:11,080
When you, um...

747
01:55:11,180 --> 01:55:13,900
When your plane went down,

748
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:16,100
everything just sort of
got put on hold.

749
01:55:18,890 --> 01:55:21,190
I think about
taking it up again, though.

750
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:34,730
I came out here
to give you this.

751
01:55:36,390 --> 01:55:38,220
Oh, my God.

752
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:42,090
I'm sorry it doesn't work.

753
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,280
And I, uh,
I kept the picture.

754
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:49,420
It was all faded anyway.

755
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:53,410
I want you to have it.
I gave it to you.

756
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:56,420
That's a family heirloom,
and it should stay in your family.

757
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:08,740
<i>That's everything I have
from when you went down to now.</i>

758
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,290
They said they never figured out
what caused the crash.

759
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,800
Probably some mislabeled
hazardous material caught fire.

760
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:23,240
So here's where
that ship found you.

761
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:27,520
You drifted about 500 miles.

762
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:29,730
This is where
your island was,

763
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,000
about 600 miles
south of the Cook Islands.

764
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,680
And these are
the search grids.

765
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,530
Ships went back and forth
for weeks looking for you.

766
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:50,210
I never should've
gotten on that plane.

767
01:56:52,520 --> 01:56:54,890
I never should've
gotten out of the car.

768
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:00,390
I wanna show you something.

769
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:04,270
Come here.

770
01:57:13,580 --> 01:57:15,370
This is...
This is our car.

771
01:57:17,710 --> 01:57:19,530
You kept our car.

772
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:24,780
All right, now,
this is weird.

773
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:34,950
It's a good car.

774
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:37,260
Had a lot of memories
in this car.

775
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:39,840
Two very nice memories.

776
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:41,890
Oh, that trip
down to the Gulf, yeah.

777
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,220
So, can I drive it?

778
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:48,170
It's your car.

779
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:58,600
That's good, 'cause my...
my taxi's gone.

780
01:58:04,460 --> 01:58:06,700
Um...

781
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,620
Let me get some stuff
out of the back.

782
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:32,520
You think you're gonna
have more kids?

783
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:34,440
I don't know.

784
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:37,260
It's kind of confusing
right now.

785
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:39,940
Well, you should.

786
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:41,900
I mean, really,
you should.

787
01:58:44,270 --> 01:58:46,090
I would.

788
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:50,000
So, what now?

789
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:54,800
I don't know.

790
01:58:57,230 --> 01:58:59,050
I really don't know.

791
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:08,970
[Starts Engine]

792
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:13,070
You said
you'd be right back.

793
01:59:18,090 --> 01:59:19,920
I'm so sorry.

794
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,660
Me too.

795
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:31,600
Chuck!

796
02:00:35,340 --> 02:00:37,930
Chuck!

797
02:00:38,030 --> 02:00:39,820
Chuck!

798
02:00:56,430 --> 02:00:58,250
I always knew you were alive.

799
02:00:58,390 --> 02:01:00,870
I knew it.

800
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:03,020
But everybody said
I had to stop saying that...

801
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:05,040
that I had to let you go.

802
02:01:06,420 --> 02:01:09,200
I love you.

803
02:01:09,300 --> 02:01:11,050
You're the love of my life.

804
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:15,340
I love you too, Kelly.

805
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:18,740
More than you'll ever know.

806
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:19,090
Chuck?

807
02:02:25,710 --> 02:02:28,400
You have to go home.

808
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:16,710
We both had done
the math, and...

809
02:03:19,030 --> 02:03:21,300
Kelly added it all up.

810
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:24,750
She knew she had
to let me go.

811
02:03:24,850 --> 02:03:29,010
I added it up,
knew that I'd...

812
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:30,930
I'd lost her.

813
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:34,860
'Cause I was never gonna
get off that island.

814
02:03:37,810 --> 02:03:40,270
I was gonna die there,

815
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,230
totally alone.

816
02:03:48,370 --> 02:03:51,120
I mean, I was gonna get sick or
I was gonna get injured or something.

817
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:56,910
The only choice I had,

818
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,680
the only thing
I could control...

819
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:07,020
was when and how...

820
02:04:07,120 --> 02:04:08,950
and where
that was gonna happen.

821
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:13,320
So... I made a rope.

822
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:19,060
And I went up to the summit
to hang myself.

823
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:24,490
But I had to test it,
you know?

824
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:27,380
Of course.
You know me.

825
02:04:29,270 --> 02:04:31,090
And the weight of the log...

826
02:04:31,190 --> 02:04:34,320
snapped the limb
of the tree.

827
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:36,280
So l-l...

828
02:04:36,370 --> 02:04:38,860
I couldn't even kill myself
the way I wanted to.

829
02:04:38,970 --> 02:04:41,750
I had power over nothing.

830
02:04:49,940 --> 02:04:53,320
And that's when this feeling
came over me like a warm blanket.

831
02:04:57,210 --> 02:04:59,150
I knew...

832
02:04:59,250 --> 02:05:01,430
somehow...

833
02:05:01,530 --> 02:05:03,730
that I had to stay alive.

834
02:05:05,300 --> 02:05:07,120
Somehow.

835
02:05:08,180 --> 02:05:10,350
I had to keep breathing,

836
02:05:12,850 --> 02:05:14,800
even though there was
no reason to hope.

837
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:20,400
And all my logic said that
I would never see this place again.

838
02:05:25,110 --> 02:05:27,760
So that's what I did.

839
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:30,280
I stayed alive.

840
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:32,210
I kept breathing.

841
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:36,530
And then one day
that logic was proven all wrong,

842
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:38,450
because the tide...

843
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,890
came in,
gave me a sail.

844
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:49,270
And now, here I am.

845
02:05:52,500 --> 02:05:55,320
I'm back...

846
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:57,800
in Memphis, talking to you.

847
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:02,220
I have ice in my glass.

848
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:10,930
And I've lost her
all over again.

849
02:06:18,490 --> 02:06:20,790
I'm so sad that
I don't have Kelly.

850
02:06:25,750 --> 02:06:28,980
But I'm so grateful that
she was with me on that island.

851
02:06:35,860 --> 02:06:37,870
And I know
what I have to do now.

852
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:42,640
I gotta keep breathing.

853
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:47,570
Because tomorrow,
the sun will rise.

854
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:51,180
Who knows what the tide
could bring?

855
02:07:04,570 --> 02:07:07,980
<i>[Elvis Presley]
 I gave a letter to the postman  </i>

856
02:07:08,090 --> 02:07:09,910
<i> He put it in his sack  </i>

857
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:14,670
<i> Bright and early
next morning  </i>

858
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:17,300
<i> He brought my letter back  </i>

859
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:19,220
<i> She wrote upon it  </i>

860
02:07:19,320 --> 02:07:21,140
<i> Return to sender  </i>

861
02:07:22,420 --> 02:07:24,370
<i> Address unknown  </i>

to open his heart.

to him, say it before we begin.

since we are very close.

contestants everything.

51

sing well if he looks bad.

52

And they sing well
when he looks good.

53
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,450
I always tell him in the waiting
room to put on a poker face.

54

to make his face unreadable.

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,810
I'm not nervous...

169
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm worried because
I have a cold, but...

170
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,390
I want to be on stage.

171
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,880
No contestant is good
at every round.

172
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:03,450
But Ye-dam showed improvement
on almost every round.

173
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,440
He never messed up.
It's frightening.

174
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,060
On the other hand, I think
he'll have a lot of pressure.

175
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,760
Mom and dad, I'll do well
and tell you the good news.

176
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,430
[No. 8 Bang Ye-dam]

177
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,870
[Black or White - Michael Jackson]

178
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,320
That was Bang Ye-dam's
cute and charismatic stage.

179
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:48,370
The judges were smiling brightly.
Will he advance to TOP8?

180
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,420
We just watched 2,000 won
and Bang Ye-dam.

181
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,690
Let's hear the judges' commentary
on what they thought of the stage.

182
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,430
It's hard for us when you throw
a strong punch from the start.

183
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:05,370
I'll start with 2,000 won.

184
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:12,210
I liked the energy. I felt proud
that you are back to your old self.

185
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,730
Seems the live broadcast
suits you guys.

186
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,880
Hyo-bin's voice and
Il-do's rap were good.

187
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:31,040
One advice, Hyo-bin should be more
playful and smile while singing.

188
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,240
Ye-dam, you're 12, right?

189
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,530
Someone your age can't
do such a performance.

190
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,200
My voice is trembling
because I'm overwhelmed.

191
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,970
Dance, gestures, tune...
It's truly frightening.

192
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,570
You'll become great.

193
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:00,290
One advice, when you sing while
dancing, you look at the ground.

194
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,430
A singer needs to pull
in the audience.

195
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,740
Make more eye contact.
I really enjoyed it.

196
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,310
Thank you very much.
She was very excited.

197
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,010
Let's hear the next one.

198
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,550
Bang Ye-dam was good in the
preliminaries, but had a problem.

199
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,040
His voice is very small.

200
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,430
You press your throat to make
the sound and breathe from top.

201
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,200
Thus, the ringing of your voice
is small and sounds thin.

202
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,510
On the first lesson, you switched
breathing from top to bottom.

203
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,050
Do you remember the two
ways to lift your chin?

204
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:45,990
These two things can't
be corrected overnight.

205
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,420
It takes several months to
switch breathing position.

206
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,340
Even pressing the throat.

207
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,040
How did you correct
those two?

208
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,850
Practice...

209
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:01,660
Did you think about
it as you sang?

210
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,690
Umm... no.

211
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:10,830
It's like changing the batting
stance during a baseball season.

212
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,760
It's like changing the stance
and continually making home runs.

213
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,080
It's incredible.

214
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,020
I always said rhythm is more
important than singing.

215
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,000
You showed how it is
to sing with rhythm.

216
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,090
You also showed how it can be
dynamic when the voice is open.

217
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,420
Vocalization and breathing were
perfect. I couldn't find any flaws.

218
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,580
Thank you.

219
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,740
If it wasn't for Ye-dam,
2,000 won would have...

220
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,360
It was shocking. I think
it was the best you did.

221
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,560
The idea was great and
the arrangement was great.

222
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,450
Since stage production and
arrangement are skills...

223
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,200
It was an excellent stage.

224
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,280
One thing was unfortunate.
Il-do's rap was great.

225
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:05,290
But Hyo-bin still sang in an
old style pressing the throat.

226
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,430
I enjoyed it.

227
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,050
Thank you JYP for
your commentary.

228
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,390
Both received good
compliments.

229
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,550
Now it's YG.

230
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,950
What BoA said was correct.

231
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,140
It's been a while since a
12-year old frightened me.

232
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,580
I mean, there never was.

233
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:35,760
When he sang Justin Bieber's
"Baby", I thought, "Oh? Look at that."

234
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,630
When I saw today's stage,
it was incredible.

235
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:48,310
Ear, rhythm, ability, talent,
cuteness - he has it all.

236
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,180
The amazing thing is that...

237
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,870
Even existing singers can't just
sing Michael Jackson's songs.

238
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,420
This was a hard stage trying
to interpret this song.

239
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:02,120
Last week, the girl group messed
up trying to show many things.

240
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,350
But he knew the points
where to sing and dance.

241
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,480
He was focused when singing
and focused when dancing.

242
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,020
His dance wasn't flashy, but it's
frightening that he knew how.

243
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:21,470
On the other hand, 2,000 won
did well like what JYP said.

244
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,270
But you met the wrong
opponent. You had no luck.

245
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:37,240
One advice, Il-do is
overexcited on stage.

246
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,200
But Hyo-bin's not excited.

247
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:49,470
Hyo-bin should enjoy more
and Il-do should refrain.

248
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:54,170
Anyways, I felt great watching
both of your performances.

249
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,460
Thank you very much.

250
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,850
The commentaries were long.
That means it was good.

251
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,310
Please announce the
victor of the 4th battle.

252
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,450
It's going to be hard.

253
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,800
It is hard.
I'll go first.

254
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,440
The victor chosen by SM...
It was very hard.

255
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,720
2,000 won is back to their old self
and Ye-dam showed his potential.

256
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,060
They were evenly matched.

257
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:31,220
The one who captured my heart...
The victor chosen by SM is...

258
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,100
- Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

259

Please announce
the next victor.

260
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,140
Both put on their
best stage so far.

261
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:51,780
Especially 2,000 won. I wondered
if they had more, but I enjoyed it.

262
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,570
Since I need to choose, the
victor chosen by JYP is...

263
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:04,810
Good thing we're not scoring
or I would've given a high score.

264
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,280
- It's Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

265
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,760
He made it to TOP8, but
let's hear YG's choice.

266
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:18,170
The victor chosen
by YG is...

267
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:23,460
I like those who enjoy
themselves on stage.

268
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,830
I gave many compliments. He
enjoys it and isn't nervous.

269
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,650
- It's Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

270
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,850
Bang Ye-dam is the
4th finalist for TOP8.

271
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,070
2,000 won put on a great stage
but faced the wrong opponent.

272
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:45,040
You lost but aren't eliminated.

273
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,180
Your votes decide whether
they advance to TOP8.

274

please vote for them.

279
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,240
What is she going to do?

280
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,520
She's facing her
toughest opponent.

What do I do?

283
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,390
I hoped it wouldn't be us,
but when she picked us...

284
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,240
We collapsed. I
fell from my chair.

285
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,090
I didn't know how
to accept this.

286
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,530
When I opened it,
I saw an "S".

287
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,610
When I saw that letter, I had
goosebumps from my legs up.

288
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,450
Shin Ji-hoon barely
made it to TOP10.

289
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,130
But it's just her luck
to face Raccoon Boys.

290
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:00,640

or her greatest chance.

days later than the others]

Let's welcome her!
Give her a big hand!

295
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:24,780
Since I came later
than others...

296
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,510
My time to practice is
shorter compared to them.

297
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,630
So the pressure is great.

298
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,140
I spend most of
my time alone.

299
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,040
I'm alone on the
rink when I skate.

stage for KPOP STAR.

301

and I'm on stage alone.

302

against myself.

303

is also my fight.

and put on a good stage.

306

But Shin Ji-hoon is not.

307
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,360
It'll be a miracle if she beats
them; something extraordinary.

308

Although I joined late...

309
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:25,590
I'm more desperate to
fill the days I missed.

310

The three of us were born and
raised in different places.

316

The music genre we enjoy
and style are also different.

We three are different,
but through KPOP STAR...

The song really goes
well with her voice.

I knew she was good,
but not to this extent...

326
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,440
She's a frightening contestant.

327

She has a strong high range.

how to end the last notes...

670
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:39,990
We thought who will be more
competitive and survive.

671
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:45,670
- TOP8 finalist is...
- The finalist is...

672
01:05:52,950 --> 01:05:54,950
Who will it be?

673
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:59,290
- It's 2,000 won.
- Congratulations!

674
01:05:59,290 --> 01:06:05,050
They became the TOP8
finalist. Congratulations.

675
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:11,140
It's unfortunate, but
Sung Soo-jin is eliminated.

676
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:21,130
After 7 long months, Lee Jin-woo
and Sung Soo-jin will part.

677
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:24,930
Their friends are
cheering them up.

678
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:30,320
Lee Jin-woo, it was
tough until now.

679
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,610
How do you feel?

680
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:38,870
It's amazing I made to TOP10.
It was a good experience.

681
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:41,470
Thank you for
all that time.

682
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:44,100
Please give her a
round of applause.

683
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,680
All that time must
have been hard.

684
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:57,390
Sung Soo-jin, you rechallenged
after all the ups and downs.

685
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:03,160
Unfortunately, you couldn't go
all the way. How do you feel?

686
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:13,830
My dream was to make to TOP10 so
I feel very good that it came true.

687
01:07:13,830 --> 01:07:16,880
You answered very calmly.

688
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,050
A round of applause
for her as well.

689
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:25,950
Will the judges also give
them words of encourgement?

690
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:36,180
Honestly, you two are eliminated,
but we wanted to see your next stage.

691
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:43,330
Lee Jin-woo, this stage was lacking,
but you showed an unforgettable stage.

692
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,910
We really wanted to
see your next stage.

693
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:51,400
Sung Soo-jin, you showed
an amazing transformation.

694
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:55,620
You made me think I thought
wrongly of you last season.

695
01:07:55,620 --> 01:08:01,440
We wanted to see you both, but
since we needed to choose one...

696
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,740
We chose one, but we truly
wanted to see both of you.

697
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:10,500
Especially, Sung Soo-jin changed
amazingly compared to last year.

698
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,270
Thank you for allowing us
to hear some good songs.

699
01:08:14,270 --> 01:08:16,850
Thank you very much.

700
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,250
Can each of you say
something, BoA?

701
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:26,030
I became close to them
as we trained together.

702
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:31,370
They showed a new side
and we became close.

703
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:37,220
Both of them sing well
and they are beautiful.

704
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:43,740
I hope to see you on a gayo
show and not at an audition.

705
01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,850
It's a pity since
we got close.

706
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:47,510
- It must be.
- It is.

707
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,160
Both of you are pretty!

708
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:53,620
She wants to see them
on a gayo show.

709
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,470
It means she wants them
to continue music.

710
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,300
YG, a word please?

711
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:09,060
Since they spoke, I'll give advice
to the TOP8 finalists instead.

712
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:15,540
Before that, there's something
BoA and JYP said to me.

713
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:21,160
They said they couldn't forget
Bang Ye-dam's stage.

714
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:25,520
It really moved us here.

715
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,800
But the sound on television is
different from the sound here.

716
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:35,240
I heard that Bang Ye-dam's
voice was small.

717
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:38,220
If possible, come here
and watch them.

718
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:43,100
Since they are witnesses.

719
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:49,460
There was one thing I didn't
get to say to Bang Ye-dam.

720
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:54,440
You have all this talent, but
the frightening thing is...

721
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,270
You don't get stage fright.

722
01:09:57,270 --> 01:10:02,230
To all the TOP8 finalists,
especially Shin Ji-hoon...

723
01:10:02,230 --> 01:10:10,950
Enjoy the stage. When you enjoy,
we and the viewers can enjoy.

724
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:18,280
Keep that in mind and prepare
a stage you're satisfied with.

725
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:20,210
Thank you very much.

726
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:24,310
Don't you have anything
to say to the eliminated?

727
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,640
- I might cry so I can't.
- I understand.

728
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:33,130
Unfortunately, Lee Jin-woo and
Sung Soo-jin are eliminated.

729
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:37,970
Next week will be an even
fiercer battle among the TOP8.

730
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:42,510
We're curious who
will battle who.

731
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:45,600
We're also curious who
will win that battle.

732
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:51,170
Please look forward to next
week's unpredictable battle.

733
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:53,090
See you next week!
Goodbye!

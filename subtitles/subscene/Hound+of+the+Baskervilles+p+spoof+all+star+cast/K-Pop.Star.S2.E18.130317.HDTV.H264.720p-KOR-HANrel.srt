If there are any tasks to
check last, discuss them...

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,390
Those that got good comments,
have a low chance of success.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,680
They shouldn't be singing in a
register they're comfortable in.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,630
Each of them has to show
the limits of their skills.

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:30,400
- Then we can cast them.
- That's right.

We will give the TOP5
a casting mission.

- It's ominous!
- What is that?

We want to confirm these if
we want them as our singer.

That is their mission.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,060
I want to hear Soo-hyun and
Chan-hyuk's voices closely.

17

Do you know this
song? I don't!

Do you know?

19
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:11,000
They kept in tune with eye contact
before, but now they don't do that.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,770
They need a song with
a strong offensive.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,420
I want to hear Andrew sing
"When I Was Your Man".

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm worried that Koreans won't be
immersed if it's an unknown song.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,990
He needs a popular song
that can reach everyone.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,690
How about "Red Dragonfly"?

[Ye-dam is going to sing

This is hard.

27
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,170
They need sincerity in this
battle and not showmanship.

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,040
It's hard because they
sound like existing singers.

29

It's going to be a very
difficult stage because...

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,620
They have to do what we ask
and not what they're good at.

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,000
Watching to cast and watching
to judge is clearly different.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,590
They need to show their
skills, not a good stage.

35
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,980
How much of the mission can
they complete in a week?

36
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,360

in the casting audition.

Hi, I'm the MC, Yoon Do-hyun,
for KPOP STAR Season 2.

53
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,710
KPOP STAR's live broadcast
started out with ten teams.

54
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:12,840
Through the 1:1 battle
the past four weeks...

55
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Five teams were eliminated
and only the TOP5 remain.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,300
The TOP5 will not
have a 1:1 battle.

57
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,530
It will be done in
a different way.

58
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:29,060
The TOP5 were given
a special mission.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,510
I will tell you
what it is later.

60
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:39,500
Also look forward to the special
stage the TOP5 prepared.

61

great for them.

- BoA?
- Yes?

68
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,680
I heard today's battle isn't
1:1 but a different method.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,370
May I ask what it is?

70
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:19,800
Scoring is back and that means
we expect a fierce battle.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:27,010
Their total score will be our
scores plus the viewers' votes.

72
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:31,590
The four teams with the highest
scores will get casted.

73
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:38,980
The one team with the lowest score
won't get casted and will be eliminated.

74
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,260
I see. That means the
casting audition begins.

75
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:49,960
JYP, I heard they have a special
mission. Could you tell us?

76
00:05:49,960 --> 00:06:01,930
We created missions to check last
what we want in them as our singers.

77
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,170
What missions...

78
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,470

out what we want to confirm.

The contestants are desperate since
the 3 agencies will be casting.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,010
Do you have any advice, request
or encouragement for them?

86
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:46,630
In Season 1, we already expected a
winner like Lee Hi and Park Ji-min.

87
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:51,780
Every time I speak with BoA or
JYP before coming up here...

88
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:57,930
We can't anticipate who will be
eliminated and who will win.

89
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:07,180
I want them to do their best as
practiced and get good results.

90
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,700
I understand. We request a
fair and careful judgment.

91

Today, judges' score is 70%
and viewers' votes are 30%.

92

The team with the lowest
score will be eliminated.

93
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,730
The TOP4 will get casted
to SM, YG, or JYP.

94
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,240

and prepare for the next round.

name or number of the finalist.

111

You can vote for more than one person,
but no multiple votes for one person.

112

We agreed to have no regrets and
give all our energy even if we lose.

the rules...

in his rap in the introduction.

168
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:00,350
When a rapper sings, there's
something that reaches us.

169
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,380
Maybe it's because the
lyrics were conveyed well.

170
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,330
You had a great start, but
one thing was unfortunate.

171
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:14,230
I could see Hyo-bin trying
to get rid of the old style.

172
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,650
I thought why you sounded old.
You always bend the first note.

173
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,610
Although you get rid of the vibrato
at the end to not sound old...

174
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,690
You started off sounding
old. That was a pity.

175
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,940
I liked how Il-do
was well-organized.

176
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,240
The rap was first calm and
then exploded in the middle.

177
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,280
It would've been great if
Hyo-bin exploded together.

178
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,920
You were stable, but you put too
much importance on it at that part.

179
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,500
Overall, you performed the
mission well. I enjoyed it.

180
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,780
She said they were stable
but somewhat lacking.

181
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,340
- What is their score?
- I'll announce it.

182
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,890
- SM's score is...
- It's SM's score.

183
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,970
It's 89! They got
89 from BoA.

184
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:18,470
We're curious of the next
commentary and score.

185
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,320
My commentary is very
similar to what BoA said.

186
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,810
I wanted to talk about the
note bending, but she did.

187
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,320
To add to that...

188
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,720
Even though you tense your body
and singing, never the mouth.

189
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,660
Tensing the lips and chin
make you sound old.

190
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,510
You didn't do that
in the first part.

191
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:54,120
But you tensed your mouth
later and sounded old.

192
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,560
She said she wanted you to
explode towards the end.

193
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,850
Don't try to explode with singing.
Get immersed in the lyrics.

194
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,670
When your emotions explode,
singing will naturally explode.

195
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:15,250
You could make a better climax if
you take care of it with emotions.

196
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,090
Il-do, you were great.

197
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:24,740
The flow was a bit monotonous.
Get in rhythm in different ways.

198
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,640
JYP's score is...

199
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,270
He said emotion is better than
skills. What's their score?

200
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,570
It's 85!

201
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,750
Last is YG's score
and commentary.

202
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,150
The interesting thing
here on KPOP STAR is...

203
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,060
I don't give a detailed
commentary on singing.

204
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,520
Since BoA and JYP are singers,
they comment on the singing.

205
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,170
I didn't because I
don't sing well.

206
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,930
But this commentary
is going to be mixed.

207
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,750
I think differently
from BoA and JYP.

208
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,570
Each song has a mood. You
were excited every stage.

209
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:19,020
But you were stable today.
You sang while sitting down.

210
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,760
That was a new stage for you.
But just as I said before...

211
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:31,350
Il-do's voice and motion is the same
whether the song is slow or fast.

212
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,760
For example, if Min-suk of
Raccoon Boys rapped this...

213
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,820
His rap would've went along
with Hyo-bin's singing.

214
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,490
Your actions were bigger
than the music.

215
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:51,620
That was a pity, but it was new
to see you sing while sitting.

216
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,530
Good job.
YG's score is...

217
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,120
He said their new image was
impressive. What's the score?

218
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,650
It's 87!

219
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,790
The total is 261.

220
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:15,510
If you liked it, text #0606
with 2,000 won or No. 1.

221
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,760
This stage was by
No. 1 2,000 won!

222
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,330
Bang Ye-dam needs
a new image.

223
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,880
It's time for him
to actually sing.

224
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,080
Putting aside the
excitment, he should...

225
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:35,650
Since "Baby", he danced
and performed.

226
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,070
Now it's time to show
off his singing skills.

227
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:46,690
[What mission was
given to him?]

228
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,440
I was surprised when
I received my mission.

229
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,920
Starting with the title,
I never heard this before.

230
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,460
I was curious why they
chose this song for me.

231
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,460
[What song is it?]

232
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:06,050
["When a Man Loves a Woman" was
well-known due to Michael Bolton]

233
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:14,660
There's a lot of high notes
and I never heard it before.

234
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,350
It was hard.

235
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,080
I don't understand the
lyrics because I'm young.

236
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,720
So I asked Brian for help.

237
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Here, because a man
loves a woman...

238
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,200
I know that feeling
because I'm a man.

239
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,910
- Have you felt that?
- No, no.

240
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,080
- You do, don't you?
- No, I don't.

241
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,770
- None.
- Really?

242
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,790
- What was her name?
- No, I don't.

243
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,350
- There isn't anyone.
- Think about her and sing.

244
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,180
- What are you talking about?
- Why are you blushing then?

245
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,780
I don't have much experience
liking someone like the lyrics.

246
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:03,290
I'm worried who to think
about as I sing this song.

247
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,490
What about BoA?

248
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,560
Ah...

249
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,370
That's good.

250
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,370
[He'll think of BoA]

251
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,120
What expression do you
want to see on JYP?

252
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,530
[He's casted to JYP
with that look!]

253
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,070
I'm worried because
this is very hard.

254
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,200
His skill has to go up
another level to sing it.

255
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,630
If Ye-dam could
sing this...

256
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:38,280
All three agencies will
wage a casting war.

257
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,860
The song I'm going
to sing is very hard.

258
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,970
I will try hard to
put on a good stage.

259
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,880
Yeah!

260
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,300
[No. 2 Bang Ye-dam]

261
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,790
[When a Man Loves a Woman - Percy Sledge]

262
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,460
The crowd's going wild.
Bang Ye-dam, he's just...

263
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,200
The harmonica playing, ???
pink jacket... He was cool.

264
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,020
We're curious what the judges
thought and what the score is.

265
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,790
I'll go first.

266
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:19,880
I was at a restaurant and got a
text that Michael Jackson died.

267
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:27,790
But for no reason, I cried.
That's how much I liked him.

268
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,940
When you hear him sing "Ben", the
songs he sang when he was young...

269
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,180
You can hear the sound at the top of
the skull when he sings the high notes.

270
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,620
Singers know what that is.

271
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,670
Ye-dam makes that sound
at the high notes.

272
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,350
People who know that
are knocked senseless.

273
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,950
From low to high, he doesn't
strain the sound with his muscles.

274
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:04,850
What's amazing is that he got
that during this program.

275
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:12,420
My previous commentary was
to explode with emotion.

276
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,890
Towards the end, Ye-dam
didn't explode with singing.

277
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:21,620
He made the lyrics he couldn't understand
with the heart and exploded it in singing.

278
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:30,480
Lastly, the timing can make the
ad-lib sound refined or not.

279
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,570
His timing was very refined
that it's unexplainable.

280
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,930
Since I don't have
much time...

281
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,460
- From that expression...
- First time having tears...

282
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,130
JYP's score is...

283
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:49,630
I'm very curious what he'll
give since he praised him...

284
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:55,750
Bang Ye-dam got 98!
Wow, a 98!

285
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,130
He said his emotion
was good.

286
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,350
Let's hear the next score
and commentary.

287
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,340
I'm not amazed at
Bang Ye-dam anymore.

288
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,510
You can't explain
this in words.

289
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:19,180
The viewers might think why
we are complimenting him.

290
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:25,390
There are many children participants
in a program called "Star King".

291
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,580
There's a difference between
them and Bang Ye-dam.

292
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:39,000
They're good at imitating while
he has skills pros don't have.

293
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,660
You just talked about
Michael Jackson.

294
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,330
He moved many people when he
sang with The Jackson 5.

295
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:50,610
Today's stage by Bang
Ye-dam was the best.

296
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,800
- That's a good commentary.
- YG's score is...

297
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,500
We're curious of
YG's score.

298
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,080
He praised him highly,
and the score is 95!

299
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,480
That's a good score.

300
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,960
Did he think of BoA as
he sang? Right, BoA?

301
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:10,830
Did you think as you saw me? Sorry.
Did you think of me while singing?

302
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,610
Did you? It's okay,
tell the truth.

303
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,390
I'm sorry?

305
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,630
Can I change my score?
I'm going to change it.

306
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:23,780
He's still young
so it's okay.

307
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,480
He has a sense of rhythm and the
skill to make the song his own.

308
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,210
Ye-dam's breathing is short
and voice is unstable.

309
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,870
People might think, "Why are the
judges going wild over him?"

310
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,770
In terms of instruments, a violin
sounds different from a cello.

311
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,800
A person's body is
also an instrument.

312
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,280
His soundbox is small since
he's not fully grown yet.

313
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,050
But the skills and sense
of rhythm he possesses...

314
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,510
I thought if there would
be another like him.

315
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:10,470
Since they said many good things,
I'm going to point out some things.

316
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:15,900
I always felt this, but you
don't fully convey the lyrics.

317
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:21,590
It'll be great if you
are able to do that.

318
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,910
Considering how you sped up during
the break, I announce SM's score.

319
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,600
This is SM's score.

320
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
What will he get?

321
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,900
It's 93!

322
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,560
The total is 286.

323
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:48,710
If you liked it, text #0606
with Bang Ye-dam or No. 2.

324
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:51,270
This stage was by
No. 2, Bang Ye-dam!

325
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,570
Which opponent do
you fear the most?

326
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,330
Andrew...

327
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,550
Andrew... You just can't...
You can't beat him.

328
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,950
Andrew...

329
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,780
Andrew won all three.

330
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,730
[He won against Akdong Musician,
Choi Ye-geun, and Raccoon Boys]

331
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,070
He's on the rise
every round.

332
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,170
Andrew Choi put on a lot of showy
performances during the live broadcast.

333
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:36,580
I chose this thinking it's time
he moves us with just singing.

334
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,060
The judges gave you a
mission. What was it?

335
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:43,930
The song title...

336
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,540
It's Korean and long...
Sorry, I don't remember.

337
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,190
Tell us as much
as you remember.

338
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,930
Sleep... Sleepless Night?
That's correct, right?

339
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,150
- I don't think so.
- That's not it?

340
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,820
[Embarrassed]

341
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:04,720
Sleepless Rainy Night.

342
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,420
[Kim Gun-mo's unique style
and soul that is hard to sing]

343
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,010
This song will push
his voice to the limit.

344
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:18,540
His singing style is more liked
by YG than either SM or JYP.

345
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,490
If he sings this well, I
might be more interested.

346
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,290
He could make it to TOP4
if he sings this well.

347
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,940
Because it's in Korean, I write
the translation to understand.

348
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,520
There's a rap in
the original.

349
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:41,900
[Arranging the rap
part in his style?]

350
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,450
I'm going to change it
into an R&B, soul style.

351
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,110
Anything hard?

352
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,310
There's a lot.

353
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,780
- What's the most difficult?
- The most difficult is...

354
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,570
My parents are in the States, and it's
been over 3 years since I saw them.

355
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,730
[No. 3 Andrew Choi]

356
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,360
[Sleepless Rainy Night - Kim Gun-mo]

357
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:45,850
He sure has a sweet voice.
That stage was by Andrew Choi.

358
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,150
We're curious of the
judges' commentary.

359
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:57,620
Before you started, everyone said
they were afraid of you in the video.

360
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:03,140
I think you're like an X-man,
KPOP STAR 2's X-man.

361
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,150
I thought you would
never come this far.

362
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,460
But every round you
showed something new.

363
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,250
Overall, I liked the song. I
think JYP will also compliment.

364
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,220
His voice was open, right?

365
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:23,720
When you started with, "Outside
the window, it is raining"...

366
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,530
I saw you many times, but it's my
first time hearing such a voice.

367
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:34,590
I was surprised. I just gave you a
nickname, KPOP STAR 2's X-man.

368
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,910
I enjoyed it.
YG's score is...

369
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,100
He said good things.

370
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm curious of his score.

371
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,530
It's 90!

372
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,660
Next commentary and
score is by BoA.

373
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:58,980
If I remember correctly,
this is a 90s song, right?

374
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,470
- Right?
- You're right.

375
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:08,020
A 90s song was rearranged, and
you changed the melody, right?

376
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:19,300
He had a great sense in arranging it
that it didn't sound like an old song.

377
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,100
You showed today what a
well-organized song is.

378
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,830
You started off softly
then hit the climax.

379
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:34,220
Lastly, you finished it off with
a voice that melted my heart.

380
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,660
It was a perfect stage.
High notes, singing...

381
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,200
I think it was a perfect
stage. I enjoyed it.

382
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,220
SM's score is...

383
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,160
She gave good compliments,
but what is the score?

384
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,650
SM's score is 93!

385
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,490
He's getting high scores.

386
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,200
Last is JYP's score
and commentary.

387
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:01,080
There's something I learned
being a KPOP STAR judge.

388
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,530
If something's really good,
I shouldn't say that it is.

389
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,790
I shouldn't compliment since
it has a negative connotation.

390
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,710
- I learned it...
- But you used it.

391
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,090
I learned it, but I
use it because...

392
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,840
I can't fix it overnight since
I used it for a long time.

393
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,010
So I thought he couldn't fix his
old habit of straining his throat.

394
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,120
But he did it for the
first time last week.

395
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:32,700
This morning I was praying that
he doesn't go back to his habits.

396
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,140
But that vocalization
is now set in him.

397
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,250
It was great to hear.

398
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:47,250
Now that you have that vocalization,
you don't need to focus on it anymore.

399
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,510
Just sing naturally. When you were
focused on that vocalization...

400
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,970
The space between your mouth
and chin was opened too much.

401
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:58,210
That vocalization will come out
even when you sing comfortably.

402
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,440
I enjoyed it.
JYP's score is...

403
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,470
He said his unfixable
vocalization was fixed.

404
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:07,090
It's 90!

405
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:11,720
The total is 273.

406
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,270
His father is in the audience.
Why don't you say something?

407
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,070
My brother's here too.

408
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,170
- Your father's there, right?
- My brother as well.

409
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,910
Oh? Say something
to him too.

410
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:32,240
He greeted them in
an American way.

411
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:40,180
If you liked it, text #0606
with Andrew Choi or No. 3.

412
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,600
This stage was by
No. 3, Andrew Choi!

413
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:54,860
We received a wildcard two
weeks ago and also last week.

414
00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:00,380
Since the live broadcast began,
preparation became difficult.

415
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:10,430
We felt burdened performing with a
live band and other new sounds.

416
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:14,990
We don't know what
that other 2% is.

417
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,900
That's our biggest concern.

418
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,350
The most serious is
Raccoon Boys.

419
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,460
I don't understand how they
did "Thriller" with one guitar.

420
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,420
How was it exciting
with one guitar?

421
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,400
I think they get stiff because of the
Korean lyrics, especially McKay.

422
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,150
I think the biggest
difference is...

423
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:37,330
Brian and McKay did sing passionately
for their part, even with a head voice.

424
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,420
They killed their part to come
together. That couldn't come out.

425
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,320
Raccoon Boys aren't bad.

426
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,630
Since they raised the
public's expectations...

427
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,980
They should choose a song where
each can show off their skills.

428
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,310
[He thought of a song?]

429
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,200
This is a well-known song.

430
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,310
- This is how it's done.
- Everyone knows this.

431
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,080
This part is where
Min-suk raps.

432
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,630
Great!

433
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:08,880
This is it.

434
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:18,090
They can show off all their
skills in singing and rapping.

435
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:23,770
Don't make it exciting, but
make it touching throughout.

436
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,260
Each of us will have a part in the
beginning to show our strengths.

437
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,900
As we finish it off
with a harmony...

438
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,050
A gospel choir will enter
and explode the stage.

439
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,590
Explode?

440
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,860
What am I supposed to say?

441
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,990
[Anyways they're preparing
a moving climax]

442
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:47,370
It's sad but also touching.

443
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:53,680
I wrote lyrics on thanking people
around me that I don't really know.

444
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,270
[Another nerve-racking
competition ahead]

445
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,050
[They're most grateful
to their members]

446
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,280
If the Raccoon Boys
sing this well...

447
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:34,550
Not only JYP, but BoA and I
would also like to cast them.

448
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,820
We will show you again
how strong we are.

449
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,070
Raccoon's back!

450
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,830
That was awkward.

451
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,680
[No. 4 Raccoon Boys]

452
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:05,710
You are the reason I dream
The reason I'm breathing now

453
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,370
[I'll Be Missing You - Puff Daddy
Original (Every Breath You Take - The Police)]

454
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:12,320
Your eyes are my sole mirror
The stars that shine on me at night

455
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,310
Your existence is like a shadow
You breathe silently at my steps

456
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,100
From my voice, eyes, nose, mouth
They are all traces of you

457
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,550
The pain I gave might be deep
So I bite my lips

458
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,710
It's okay. Put me down now
Time, stop. You can rest

459
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,420
Your hands, I want to hold them
So you can hold me tight

460
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,600
Their harmony is the best.
It was No. 4 Raccoon Boys.

461
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,490
I'm curious what the
judges thought.

462
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,130
Please tell us the score
and commentary.

463
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:12,950
I enjoyed it.

464
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:19,950
McKay is... I'm sorry, Min-suk
always relays the lyrics well.

465
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:24,870
I can't find any
flaws for this stage.

466
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:30,640
Today's song was...

467
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,210
Brian did explode
in the high notes.

468
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:38,910
But more importantly, the
ad-lib after the high notes...

469
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:43,600
May have ruined the song.

470
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,250
That's a pity, but
the mood was great.

471
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:54,170
The vocal aspect
was a bit lacking.

472
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:58,960
McKay, is your throat condition
worsening? Is it better?

473
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:07,510
It was a pity since your voice
sounded like it was closing.

474
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,910
I enjoyed it.
SM's score is...

475
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,260
It's SM's score.

476
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:16,660
The mood was great
but lacking... It's 88!

477
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,340
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

478
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,660
Raccoon... I am your fan.

479
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,210
Since I said many times that
your combination is great.

480
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:47,000
The first and second half of a
soccer game is 45 minutes each.

481
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,190
I don't know about nowadays,
but boxing has 12 rounds.

482
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:55,100
The biggest reason people
watch boxing or soccer is...

483
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,140
They wait for that one
punch in boxing and...

484
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,010
Watch 90 minutes of soccer
for that one goal.

485
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,140
What I felt now and before
about Raccoon Boys...

486
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:14,500
It's like you're trying to
win boxing with a call.

487
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,410
You're trying to
keep it safe.

488
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:21,560
You throw jabs and no
strong counterpunch.

489
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:26,270
You win in the end, but we
don't remember anything.

490
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:33,550
I wanted you to do well, but I
couldn't forget that impression.

491
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,500
But it was a good
stage. YG's score is...

492
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,950
He said there was
no special punch.

493
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:43,630
YG's score is... 83!

494
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,190
Last is JYP.

495
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:57,710
You can't tell if a person dances
well or not with a fast song.

496
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,400
Same with singing.

497
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,520
There's not much difference when music
is fast and there's a lot of instruments.

498
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:14,340
Singing skills stand out when there are
no instruments and it's medium tempo.

499
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,350
I felt it again today.

500
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:23,870
McKay and Brian have many problems
with vocalization and breathing.

501
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,590
You weren't good and fixed it.
But it felt like you regressed.

502
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:34,960
It's like if Andrew was open,
he's voice is strained again.

503
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,920
You don't sing with your
head in the high notes...

504
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,020
And your chest in
the low notes.

505
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:46,550
We can't listen for long since
you sing everything here.

506
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:52,270
I want Min-suk to change
the flow with the song.

507
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:57,240
It's a pity you're
using the same flow.

508
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:01,380
I want Raccoon Boys
to explode again.

509
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:08,030
I think you should practice
on fixing your basic flaws.

510
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:09,710
JYP's score is...

511
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,390
He spoke mostly
of their flaws.

512
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:16,900
The score is... 85!

513
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:21,780

I'm getting recognition too.

It was a perfect song.

522
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:00,950
I always think, "Wow."
It was amazing.

523
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:07,860
I want to hear Soo-hyun and
Chan-hyuk's voices closely.

524
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:11,180
I'm curious what voice Soo-hyun
could give if she really sings.

525
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:16,670
They haven't sung a song that
showed their singing skills.

526
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:22,160
The song we requested is Tamia's
"Officially Missing You".

527
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,980
Some Korean singers made
a remake of this song.

528
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:33,160
A genuine stage with Soo-hyun's
charming voice and Chan-hyuk's rap.

529
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:37,400
A high chance that it could
be better than the original.

530
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:40,180
This is hard.

531
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,780
I don't feel good.

532
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:50,880
After Ji-hoon got eliminated,
Soo-hyun is now alone.

533
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,680
That was on my mind, and
I decided to be with her.

534
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,080
When I went over...

535
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,250
It's empty compared
to the men's room.

536
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,020
No one got eliminated in the
men's room and it's amicable.

537
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,010
The names are still there in the
women's room, but it's empty.

538
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:21,050
So this is what we thought.
That lonely and empty feeling...

539
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:24,850
If we express that in
the song, it'll go well.

540
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,170
We thought we could
express our feelings better.

541
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:35,900
We arranged it by putting
in Korean lyrics and a rap.

542
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,700
This song is based
on our experiences.

543
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:43,200
We could put on a genuine
stage. If that's conveyed...

544
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,630
Then it's a success.

Just full of traces

we laughed and cried

I don't know why the tears fall.

You must have been moved.

572

comes when they sing from the heart...

can't be described in words.

I thought, "How well would Soo-hyun
sing if she receives lessons?"

575
00:58:57,890 --> 00:59:06,130
Actually, it was Chan-hyuk who made
me cry when he sang towards the end.

576

He sang really well.

Until now, teenagers sang
songs that had to do with them.

579

Teenagers sang, but the lyrics and
music were mostly written by adults.

580

But the two of you sang
your songs in your voice.

I think you two are
precious. JYP's score is...

sang their song in their voice.

Because JYP said
he shed tears...

588
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:58,120
I thought it was due to
her singing with her heart...

589
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,880
After she talked about how
the girls left in the video.

590

because they sang well.

feel is different.

she cried in the video.

01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,050
So I read the lyrics
while they sang.

594
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:20,680

of the friends that left me.

01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:38,250
Putting aside whether
you sang well or not...

600
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:42,350

602
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:48,210
I'm curious. He had a
similar opinion to JYP.

a high score.

605
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:05,650
Soo-hyun, before you started
singing, you watched the video...

606
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:09,990
Did you almost cry
because of the video?

607
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:11,660
- Yes.
- I know!

608
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:17,680
Don't show that before they
sing. It'll be hard for them.

609
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,560
Soo-hyun's voice was thick
and pressed than usual.

610
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:33,740
I thought maybe it's because you
tried to suppress those emotions.

611
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:42,850
I think Akdong Musician is good at
combining what they face to the lyrics.

I was touched as I saw
the video and lyrics.

613

charms since the live broadcast began.

I'm also doing okay on my own

659
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,860
Pillow and toothbrush are still here
The photo album became our memory

660
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:00,880
In your arms I always loved
The dream we saw on the same spot

661
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,740
We should be happy in our own paths
Goodbye my fan, my eternal friend

662
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:46,410
If I held on to you then
I wouldn't eat ramen sadly

663
01:11:46,410 --> 01:11:50,840
If we didn't breakup
If you didn't leave me

664
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,440
Although our game of love is over
I have one last thing to say to you

665
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:59,930
Please remember me
Remember this rap to you

666
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:04,770
The streets we walked lingers
I'm falling down like a leaf

667
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:09,200
Memories grow in my head
I fall at the passing wind

668
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,690
Goodbye. I have one request
Don't cry with another man

669
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:17,930
You were with me a long time
Live happily and don't get sick

670
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:16,060
The TOP5 put on a great stage!
Another round of applause!

671
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:42,010
[Broadcast live from
Bucheon Gymnasium]

672
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:48,170
This is Surival Audition
KPOP STAR Season 2.

673
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:52,200
This TOP5 stage
was the fiercest.

674
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,210
The results have
been tallied.

675
01:13:56,210 --> 01:13:58,520
The announcement remains.

676
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,750
The judges just
got the results.

677
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:09,880
In the red envelopes are the
results and the one eliminated.

678
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:15,760
Please open them.

679
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,120
They don't know.

680
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:24,290
BoA was a bit surprised, but
we can't tell by their looks.

681
01:14:24,290 --> 01:14:31,000
Does it match with the viewers or
not? We can't tell by their looks.

682
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,980
A pity, but the eliminated
can't get casted.

683
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:37,960
Only the four that
pass can get casted.

684
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:43,990
SM, YG, and JYP will
now begin casting!

685
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:52,930
According to what you already
chose, you will begin casting.

686
01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:56,150
First is JYP.

687
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:04,110
First, it's a pity that a talented
team will get eliminated.

688
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:14,440
Of the four that advanced,
the one casted by JYP is...

689
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,270
Someone I think I will
have fun working with.

690
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,290
- Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

691
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:27,340
He's the first TOP4 finalist
and got casted to JYP.

692
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:31,620
Please move over there,
and give him a big hand.

693
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:39,020
Bang Ye-dam advanced
to TOP4 and YG is next.

694
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:54,310
Only Akdong Musician came to YG
twice and the rest never came.

695
01:15:57,620 --> 01:16:04,040
I will cast the one
that I want to fix.

696
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:08,080
- The finalist YG will cast...
- The finalist is...

697
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:11,440
It's 2,000 won.

698
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,340
Congratulations! They
got casted to YG!

699
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:17,360
They were surprised.

700
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:21,680
They advanced to TOP4.
Please move over there.

701
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:24,670
Please come closer.

702
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:33,330
Currently, 2,000 won and
Bang Ye-dam advanced.

703
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,770
They got casted
by JYP and YG.

704
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,500
Now BoA, who
did SM cast?

705
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:49,140
The TOP4 finalist
casted by SM is...

706
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,130
I'm making another
unexpected choice.

707
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:59,280
I'm excited to work with them
and I think it's going to be fun.

708
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:01,700
That finalist is...

709
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:05,830
- Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

710
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:09,360
They got casted by SM
and are TOP4 finalists.

711
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,140
Please move over there.

712
01:17:15,810 --> 01:17:24,620
So far, Bang Ye-dam to JYP, Akdong
Musician to SM, and 2,000 won to YG.

713
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:29,210
Now only one
spot remains.

714
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:41,040
SM gets the final casting.
Who is the last to get casted?

715
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:47,410
Will it be Andrew Choi
or the Raccoon Boys?

716
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:52,180
One of them will get eliminated.
BoA, please start casting.

717
01:17:55,170 --> 01:18:03,260
It's a pity that one will get casted
and the other will be eliminated.

718
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:11,040
The one that will prepare
with me for the next round is...

719
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,880
This is the final casting.
Casting or elimination?

720
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,820
Who will SM cast?

721
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:27,810
Andrew Choi and the
Raccoon Boys are on stage.

722
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,830
- It's Andrew Choi.
- Congratulations!

723
01:18:31,830 --> 01:18:36,130
He got casted to SM
and is a TOP4 finalist.

724
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:46,050
Unfortunately, Raccoon Boys
got eliminated today.

725
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:51,870
They tried hard for a better stage
and harmony, and to improve...

726
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:54,980
But they got eliminated.

727
01:18:54,980 --> 01:19:01,670
Raccoon Boys... Guys,
you did great until now.

728
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:09,740
You did great. Any last
words for your fans?

729
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:14,910
We thank you for
loving our music.

730
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:19,060
Another big hand
for Raccoon Boys.

731
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:24,150
KPOP STAR continues
next week. Goodbye!

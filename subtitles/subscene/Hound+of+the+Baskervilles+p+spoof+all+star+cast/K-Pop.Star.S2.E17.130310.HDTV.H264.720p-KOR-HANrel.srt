the smallest mistake.

another 1:1 battle today.

72

losers are in danger of elimination.

73

After the battles are over,
one will get eliminated.

74

Of the three teams that are
candidates for elimination...

75
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:06,940
One with the viewers' votes and one
with the judges' wildcard will pass.

76

will be in the TOP5.

will be the rematch.

91
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,590

It's easy, but keep
one thing in mind.

You can place your votes
for more than one person.

votes for one person.

only thing you did was...

your body while singing.

I was just talking about
the body. You were stiff.

You wore suits and had a
hard look from the start.

Your body has to assimilate with the
music when it starts, but it was stiff.

relation. I enjoyed it.

saw them today...

Andrew was the most comfortable
and his shoulders were limp.

were stiff. You were trying to do well.

[Special time to go out
for our frustrated lambs]

338
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,150
What do I do?

339
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,930
- Wow!
- It's huge!

340
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,940
[She's excited like
a fish in water]

341
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:53,880
I now realize that
she's a figure skater.

342
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:57,120
I think I could
do it too.

343
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,270
[He takes the
challenge]

344
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,100
[His rhythm is somewhat
perfect on ice]

345
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,910
- OMG!
- Oh, no!

346
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,070
[He doesn't give up
and even jumps!]

347
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,910
[Ta-da]

348
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,960
Wow! Thank you!

349
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,450
I forgot how
ramen tasted.

350
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:23,400
[No time to talk!]

351
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,300
It's really good!

352
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,820
[Snacks were prohibited for
2 months to stay in condition]

353
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,240
[Seems like she's going
to eat the pot too!]

354
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,970
Let's both make it to prevent
our room from being empty.

355
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,570
Let's do it!

356
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:48,450
We're going to sing
our song, "Crescendo".

357
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,150
When my brother was
going through puberty...

358
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,540
When he fought or had a hard time,
he was timid and didn't speak.

359
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,340
He always kept
it to himself.

360
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,060
This song has a message
for the youth that...

361
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,160
They can overcome and
speak their mind.

362
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,030
[Why did you choose
your song?]

363
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:16,010
They wanted us to do
it, so we chose it.

364
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,910
That is our only
advantage.

365
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:23,070
My dream is to make
all kinds of music.

366
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:28,750
Our concept this time
is to be like an idol.

367
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,880
This stage would be closest
to what KPOP STAR is.

368
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,020
Every good response they got
was for their own songs.

369
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,620
I hope they release their
potential with their song.

370
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:49,030
Crescendo is a musical term
meaning a gradual increase.

371
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:53,230
I hope our confidence and voice
increase gradually on stage.

372
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,140
Akdong, let's go
to TOP5! Yeah!

373
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,450
[Crescendo - own song]

374
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:48,390
My voice is getting lost
My breathing gets louder

375
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:57,300
No one listens to my words
It's rising in crescendo

376
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,230
Raise your voice. High
Notice me. Hi

377
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,950
Catch my voice
Catch it tightly, Oh hey

378
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,570
Squeeze through that gap
That pain that made you small

379
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,900
Shout toward the sky
That shines on you

380
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:22,080
For everyone to notice me
Crescendo

381
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,890
To understand me
Crescendo

382
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:50,780
My voice reaches the skies
Until the clouds hear and understand

383
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,900
My wish at sunset and early morning
Or about my love that dragged on

384
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,710
Start talking, that's what we're hoping
Don't give up without starting

385
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,740
The dream deep down in your heart
Thanks, today's weather is joy

386
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:13,360
Whether there or not, pull up your chin
Play like kids, la-ti-do-re-mi-fa

387
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:21,120
Melody rises, follow the fast tempo
Laugh aloud, hahahahaha, hahahahaha

388
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:29,050
For everyone to notice me
Crescendo

389
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:36,310
To understand me
Crescendo

390
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:43,970
For everyone to notice me
Crescendo

391
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:50,410
To understand me
Crescendo

392
00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:01,380
No. 4 Akdong Musician showed
a new charm with their song.

393
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,580
It was a battle between teams
with different personalities.

394
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:10,360
What did the judges think?
Let's hear the commentary.

395
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,950
There's a good song
and a hit song.

396
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:29,110
Some songs are popular, but fall
short on individuality and quality.

397
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:35,610
While others are not, but have
individuality and quality.

398
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,160
But Akdong Musician's
"Crescendo" got both.

399
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,770
The chord progression you
used is a very popular form.

400
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:56,850
But the melody and lyrics had
character. The melody was great.

401
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:59,430
It was a perfect song.

402
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:05,320
The difference between this and
your other songs? This is popular.

403
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,180
Even the stage and choreography
were great. It was perfect.

404
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,300
That was a good
commentary.

405
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:22,740
Ji-hoon, you sang well, but
why didn't it touch me?

406
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:26,690
Who was the "you" in the song?
Who did you think about?

407
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:33,810
Religion or friend? Who is this
"you"? Did you think about it?

408
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,480
- My mom...
- Your mom?

409
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,780
Was it Kim Soo-hwan last year
who sang "It's Fortunate"?

410
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,740
I knew he had a girlfriend when he
sang the first two lines, so I asked him.

411
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:58,870
But when you sang, it didn't seem
like you were thinking about "you".

412
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:05,060
Maybe you weren't focused because
you were trying to sing well.

413
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,730
Thank you very much.

414
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,800
Next is BoA.

415
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,440
Park Ji-min sang this
song last year.

416
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,140
I believe she was 16
as well last year.

417
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:28,430
The difference between
her and you is skill.

418
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,090
You have a clear, ringing
voice and singing is clean.

419
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:38,870
But you need skill to push
and pull people's hearts...

420
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,890
Be expressive and sing a
wider genre of songs.

421
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:50,770
But today, you concentrated
too much on the high notes.

422
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:59,020
If that high note was a single
strong punch, it would move us.

423
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,550
But there were too many
of those high notes.

424
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:10,970
I once thought why Akdong
Musician's songs are popular.

425
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,550
So I listened to all
of your songs again.

426
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,690
The emotions people
your age feel were...

427
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,190
Expressed cleverly and from
a different perspective.

428
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:27,330
That's why many people
can relate to the songs.

429
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,420
"Crescendo" has a very
hopeful message.

430
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,220
You're small but want to be big.
It was expressed in a fun way.

431
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,750
The melody and choreography
were great like what JYP said.

432
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:51,400
I personally think Chan-hyuk
is cute and cool when rapping.

433
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:59,500
Chan-hyuk's rapping voice and
Soo-hyun's beautiful voice...

434
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:05,530
The combination of your voices
was great. I enjoyed it.

435
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:07,580
Thank you very much.

436
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:10,460
Lastly, we have YG.

437
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:18,920
Shin Ji-hoon failed in her choice
of song and plan because...

438
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:22,020
Park Ji-min left a great
impression for this song.

439
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:30,560
It's true you lack in technique
and voice to catch up to her.

440
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,630
As a KPOP STAR judge, I have to
evaluate the contestant's skills.

441
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:41,520
But JYP and I are also producers.
In the case of you and Bang Ye-dam...

442
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,710
It's a problem that we think about you
in a year or two and not just now.

443
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,850
You sang well, but I had expectations
since you sang really well last week.

444
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,900
I want to be honest
with Akdong Musician.

445
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:08,060
When I first saw you,
I liked Lee Soo-hyun.

446
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:14,010
Your voice has character like a
French girl singing "chanson".

447
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:22,720
Although they're siblings, I thought
of debuting only Lee Soo-hyun.

448
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,430
- To be honest...
- You're really honest.

449
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:39,890
Chan-hyuk looked dark, depressed,
and couldn't adjust to society.

450
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,630
Chan-hyuk, I like you.
For real. I really do.

451
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:51,350
The amazing thing is that I could
see him rise with the times.

452
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,150
He looks depressed, but
did you see him today?

453
00:45:55,150 --> 00:46:01,900
That talent... I'm always amazed
when I see him. He's great.

454
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:07,590
In the history of gayo, were
there any sibling singers?

455
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:09,410
Was it Hyun-yi and...

456
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:11,630
- Hyun-yi and Deok-yi.
- That was in the 70s.

457
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:15,100
Ryang-hyun and Ryang-ha
were brothers, right? Right.

458
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,320
I'm complimenting Akdong Musician.
There aren't characters like them.

459
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,080
Their songs are unique,
and like what JYP said...

460
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:29,150
They danced and sang well today.
It was impressive. Good job.

461
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,250
Thank you very much.

462
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:36,460
The commentary was very long.
It means they had a lot to say.

463
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,390
Please announce
the results.

464
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,320
I'll go first.

465
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,630
The victor chosen by SM,
I'll say it right away.

466
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:48,310
- It's Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

467
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,140
Please announce
the next victor.

468
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:56,860
The victor chosen by
YG is Akdong Musician.

469
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,760
Congratulations! They
advance to TOP5!

470
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,320
It's not over.
Let's hear JYP.

471
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,300
The victor chosen
by JYP is...

472
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,130
I said Akdong Musician's
stage was perfect today.

473
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,630
But I remembered one. The tune
for "ti-do-re-mi-fa" was wrong.

474
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,650
Other than that,
it was perfect.

475
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,140
- We also chose Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

476
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,460
They advance to TOP5.

477
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,800
Just because Shin Ji-hoon
lost, it's not over yet.

478
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:29,330
Please wait since she
has the viewers' votes.

479
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:35,830
Next battle is the rematch. It's
Bang Ye-dam and 2,000 won.

480
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,030
They'll start now!

481
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,470
[2,000 won vs Bang Ye-dam]

482
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:49,010
Who is your opponent?

483
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,770
It's KPOP STAR's
Grim Reaper.

484
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,120
He's Mr. Bang.

485
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,900
[They want to forget the
time they picked the ball]

486
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:04,030
You're no help!

487
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,200
It's 2,000 won and
Bang Ye-dam again.

488
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,050
[A cruel trick by Fate?]

489
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:13,030
The one with potential and
the ones that help that.

490
00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:18,380
God gives us as much
pain as we can handle.

491
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,510
That pain is starting.

492
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,180
We're on a cliff
every round.

493
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,750
But we don't know how it'll turn out.
Our expectations for Ye-dam is rising.

494
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:36,740
We didn't expect much, but 2,000 won
continues putting on a great stage.

495
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,330
If they put on a really
exciting, splendid stage...

496
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:43,020
I believe they
have a chance.

497
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:52,430
Despite the good comments, we want
to show an enjoyable, playful stage.

498
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,650
We chose this song.

499
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,050
[Legendary rock group, Sanullim,

00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,760
We received many harsh
criticisms until now.

501
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,130
We turned that into a
"committed a crime" concept.

502
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:11,580
That concept came out from getting
out of the harsh criticisms quickly.

503
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:18,650
Since we passed by receiving
the most viewers' votes...

529

He's always in someone else's
practice room and not his.

530

But he's good on stage.

531

the ridiculous assumption]

00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,300
2,000 won's stage
was very good.

575
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:56,270

- Thank you very much.

Next is JYP.

587

For the first time I thought
Ye-dam won't meet expectations.

588
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:00,180
He was tense, tempo
was getting fast...

589
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,960
And he squeezed his voice. I
thought, "What's wrong with him?"

590
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,040
But after rapping,
he was relaxed.

591
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:15,370
Then he was his usual self - singing,
dancing, and everything. It was good.

592
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:21,820
Did someone make that harmonica
line or did you just play it?

593
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,420
I made it together with
the music director.

594
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:29,620
I don't know if you did
it yourself or not, but...

595
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:37,870
The highest I think was a seventh.
It's uncomfortable to play that.

596
01:00:37,870 --> 01:00:42,530
I don't know how you do that.
You don't have music education.

597
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:45,270

when I see that.

2,000 won's stage was
exciting and splendid.

599
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:58,700
One thing worries me. Does Il-do
have something other rappers don't?

01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:05,180
Whether it be flow or voice.
You were great, but...

601
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:12,400

color compared to exisiting singers?

I personally didn't like
both performances.

606
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,820
I expected a lot from 2,000 won
since they are rising right now.

607
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:34,740
Ye-dam always did well so maybe
my expectations were too high.

608
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:39,880
For Ye-dam, it was great
up to the harmonica playing.

609
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:43,290
But when you started singing,
the tunes were all wrong.

610
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:49,000
I felt uneasy. Only the
rap part was good.

611
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:57,670
Rhyming "I do, I know, oh my" was
great, but overall it was unstable.

612
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:05,140
For 2,000 won, Hyo-bin was unstable.
Although you were stable later on.

613
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,840
How should I put it? Both of
you were ahead of yourselves.

614
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,010
But that didn't reach us.

615
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:26,810
I'll make my decision on
who did better. I enjoyed it.

the next victor.

624
01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:02,230
It's hard to decide maybe
because it's the last round.

625
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:06,200
But I just made my
decision a while ago.

626
01:03:09,170 --> 01:03:12,470
I chose the one who
knows how to enjoy.

627
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,390
- It's Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

It's neck and neck.
I'm getting nervous.

629
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:21,850
I think it's because
it's a rematch.

630
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:25,360
JYP's choice will
decide everything.

631
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:32,060
It wasn't hard to choose
because they were good.

632
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,650
But they didn't meet our
expectations as BoA said.

633
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:45,180
My standard was whether
they had their own color.

634
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,950
- JYP chooses Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:54,740

Before we hear the result,
there's a special performance.

641
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:24,110
There will be a comeback stage
by last year's runner-up, Lee Hi.

642
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,410

Can you tell us
how it was?

651
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:32,460
Since I saw the choreography
many times during practice...

652
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:35,780
It was awkward seeing
that here in a while.

653
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:39,480
Lee Hi lost a
lot of weight.

654
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:43,710
You might misunderstand me, but
I never told her to lose weight.

655
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:48,220
I thought she's very good
at taking care of herself.

656

Your looks told us
that it was perfect.

now because she debuted.

How was it, as a senior?

659
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:05,740
She was a contestant last year, but
she's like a singer on TV today.

660
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:09,850
It was amazing. She also
lost a lot of weight...

- Yes, she's pretty.

01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:13,720
- You're also pretty.
- Thank you.

663
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:14,700
I'm sorry.

664
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:16,540
JYP, I'm curious.

665
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:20,200
Give a commentary
like last year.

666
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,880
Singing, visual, half
sound and half breath...

667
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,970
She was completely relaxed
and producing was great.

668
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:37,430
She's pretty and sings well. She
was a bit unnatural in her last song.

669
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:39,470
But now she's like
a real singer.

670
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,020
- Was she perfect?
- Flawless.

671
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,610
YG, I love your
commentaries.

672
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:50,370
You talked about kimchi stew
and it became a hot topic.

673
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:58,190
If you compare me, Boom, to
a stew, what would it be?

674
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:00,740
- Mixed stew?
- Thank you.

675
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:01,970
That was simple.

676
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:07,740
This is how you can debut as
soon as you win on KPOP STAR.

677
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,850
The results are in.
Are you curious?

678
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,130
Why don't we see
the final result?

679
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,850
[TOP6 Final Result]

680
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,800
[Broadcast live from
Bucheon Gymnasium]

681
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:51,450
After a fierce battle...

682
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:56,660
Andrew Choi, Akdong Musician, and
Bang Ye-dam advanced to TOP5.

683
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,980
Unfortunately, next to me are
Raccoon Boys, Shin Ji-hoon...

684
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,940
And 2,000 won. They are
candidates for elimination.

685
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:12,920
Of the three, one with viewers' votes
and one with judges' wildcard will pass.

686
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:18,500
Who among the three
will advance to TOP5?

687
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:23,850
I have the voting results and
will announce the highest.

688
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:36,750
I will now announce the TOP5
finalist chosen by the viewers.

689
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:49,160
The TOP5 finalist chosen
by the viewers is...

690
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,470
2,000 won!

691
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:53,510
Congratulations!

692
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:55,160
It's so hard
to say it.

693
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:03,100
They got the highest
votes from the viewers.

694
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,860
2,000 won dramatically survived.
How do you feel right now?

695
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:16,380
Since this is our second time
passing with the votes...

696
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:26,250
We feel sorry, and we made it
to TOP5 without beating anyone.

697
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:33,590
We should win at least once.
We love you and thank you.

698
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:37,970
Another round of applause, and
please join the others over there.

699
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:45,360
Only Raccoon Boys and
Shin Ji-hoon remain.

700
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,320
Please move here...

701
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:52,170
Only one will pass with
the judges' wildcard.

702
01:13:52,170 --> 01:13:58,430
And the other will say
farewell to KPOP STAR.

703
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:04,380
The judges are troubled since
this is an important moment.

704
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:13,980
They are discussing who will pass.
Seems like they haven't decided yet.

705
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,220
How do you feel?

706
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:31,630
Did you get it? He's nervous
and Shin Ji-hoon did well.

707
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:36,060
Still deciding?
Shin Ji-hoon?

708
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:39,070
You must be nervous...
Seems like they decided.

709
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:43,620
- We're done deciding.
- Now the announcement.

710
01:14:43,620 --> 01:15:00,190
It was hard since we never
expected them to be here.

711
01:15:00,650 --> 01:15:09,160
Raccoon Boys pleased our eyes
and ears starting with "Thriller".

712
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,580
Shin Ji-hoon always put on a
good stage starting with "Ben".

713
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:23,250
Shin Ji-hoon actually
applied for dancing.

714
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:30,920
But I believe many were pleased
to see you improve each stage.

715
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:36,310
I believe many also liked Raccoon
Boys' witty lyrics and stage.

716
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,620
We chose the one we
want to see again.

717
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,610
Please make the
announcement.

718
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:56,360
The last TOP5
finalist is...

719
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,840
- Raccoon Boys.
- Congratulations!

720
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,500
They dramatically passed!

721
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:12,230
Unfortunately, Shin Ji-hoon
was eliminated; didn't make it.

722
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:21,260
Her friends are encouraging her
and she can't stop the tears.

723
01:16:21,260 --> 01:16:24,640
Shin Ji-hoon?

724
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,960
A big hand for Shin Ji-hoon
who made it this far.

725
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:33,900
Unfortunately, she will say
farewell with this stage.

726
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,250
If you have any last
words, please say them.

727
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:50,110
I thank the judges for picking
me after I was eliminated.

728
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:52,900
I'm crying again.

729
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,790
This stage is over, but you
will have plenty in the future.

730
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,930
Another big hand for her.

731
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:03,990
Any advice for her
from the judges?

732
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:06,160
JYP?

733
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:13,780
She applied for dancing. In
other words, she never sang.

734
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:18,910
With that wonderful voice, an
open voice you're born with...

735
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:21,930
Take this chance to get singing
lessons, and practice...

736
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:24,470
Then you will be
a great singer.

737
01:17:24,470 --> 01:17:25,870
- That's right.
- You can do it!

738
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:27,810
Cheer up.

739
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:33,600
Shin Ji-hoon is eliminated, and
the TOP5 will battle next week.

740
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,360
They will battle to be casted
by the three agencies.

741
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,230
Please look forward to the exciting
stages to get casted by the agencies.

742
01:17:43,230 --> 01:17:47,380
The fierce competition to be a
K-pop star continues next week!

743
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:49,140
See you next week!
Goodbye!

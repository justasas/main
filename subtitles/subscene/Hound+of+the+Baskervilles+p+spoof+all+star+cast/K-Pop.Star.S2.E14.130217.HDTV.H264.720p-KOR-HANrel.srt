12
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,550
Many talented people were
also discovered in Season 2.

13
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:19,270
They started a lot of talk and we
finally begin the live broadcast!

14
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:28,950
After 7 months, they will battle
to become the next K-pop star.

Looking sharp.

20
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,660
- First, BoA.
- Yes.

21
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,700
- It's been a while.
- Same here.

22
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,160
- I only saw you on TV.
- I only heard your voice.

23
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,330
You must have gotten very
close with them until now.

24
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,780
How do you feel
seeing them now?

25
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,260
I remember the good and
bad times we went through.

26
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,470
I'm surprised at how classy they
are. They look like celebrities.

27
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,810
Most of all, Ye-dam
got a haricut.

28
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,910
Yes, he did.

29
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,570
- I look forward to it.
- I think he got cuter.

30
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,570
And Yang Hyun-suk?

31
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:38,080
After 7 months, do you have
any advice for the finalists?

32
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,740
This is their first
ever live broadcast.

33
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,170
I don't need to tell them
to not tremble here.

34
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,750
Even existing singers tremble
and I'm trembling up here too.

35
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,840
But keep in mind that twists
and miracles come from tension.

36
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,200
It's okay if you tremble. We look
forward to a miraculous stage.

37
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,990
Thank you for the advice.

38

And Park Jin-young?

39
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,530
Do-yeon, unfortunately,
decided to withdraw.

40
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:24,100
I heard the judges had a
long emergency meeting.

41
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,650
Could I ask about the
outcome of that meeting?

42
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,250
We were at a loss since
it happened suddenly.

43
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,720
Because we need
10 finalists...

44
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
The three of us gathered
and it took a long time.

45
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,350
Fortunately, the three of
us picked the same person.

46
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,200
Among the two left from
the consolation match...

47
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:58,780
Our decision was based on potential for
growth since that's important here.

48
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,720
I'm curious.

49
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,280
Now I reveal the result
of their meeting.

50
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:14,880
We need to discuss if we'll
consider another candidate.

51
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,630
Only Yoon Joo-suk and
Shin Ji-hoon were eliminated.

52
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,250
We need to pick
one of them.

53
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,110
If the three of you disagree,
there will be another rematch.

54
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,330
Will it be Yoon Joo-suk
who is well-developed?

55
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,760
Or Shin Ji-hoon who is
a diamond in the rough?

growth, I also choose...

from the two because...

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,230
Of her potential
for growth.

69
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:30,390
That standard never
changed in KPOP STAR.

70

71

where you move many people.

picked me again will not regret it.

last TOP10 finalist!

176
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,200
[YouU's turn!]

177
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,410
Is that it?

178
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,590
[Only 3 female
soloists remain!]

179
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,650
[They take a peek]

180
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,410
[Startled]

181
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,840
[What does their
reaction mean?]

182
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,680
Who is it?

183
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,010
[YouU vs Sung Soo-jin]

184
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:56,870
- We share the same room.
- You're in the same room?

185
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,500
I wonder what you'll talk about
at night when it's quiet...

186
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,390
On the night before
the live broadcast.

187
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,390
Now, Choi Ye-geun and
Lee Jin-woo are left.

188
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,680
It's like a bolt
from the blue.

189
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,060
My entire body
is trembling.

190
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,310
I was about to cry
when I got picked.

191
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,570
Let's do it,
Choi Ye-geun!

192
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,880
[The immense pressure!]

193
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:42,280
As you just watched, it's
going to be a 1:1 battle.

194
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,690
The finalists chose
their own opponents.

195
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,910
The first live broadcast will
air this week and next week.

196
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,580
3 groups will
battle this week.

197
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,300
Only 3 will pass
after the battle.

198
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,740
Those who pass go
to the next round.

199
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,300
Those who lost are in
danger of elimination.

200
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,670
After all the battles finish,
of the 5 teams that lost...

201
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:13,790
Two teams with the highest
viewers' votes will pass.

202
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,940
And one team with a
wildcard will pass.

203
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,150
To have a fair voting count,
it will be done in sections.

204
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:35,990
Votes will only be counted
during two battles.

205
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,840
You can vote for a certain
finalist only at that time.

206
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:47,610
I will tell you the order
of the 1:1 battle again.

207
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:56,490
The 1st battle will be dark
horse, No. 1 Lee Jin-woo.

208
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,070
And consistent genius,
No. 2 Choi Ye-geun.

209
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,770
It won't be an
easy battle.

210
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:13,350
2nd battle is KPOP STAR's
girl group, No. 3 YouU.

211
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:18,410
And with an indomitable
spirit, No. 4 Sung Soo-jin.

212
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,830
We look forward to it since
their colors are different.

213
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:29,410
3rd battle is national sibling,
No. 5 Akdong Musician.

214
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,610
And he who sways women's
hearts, No. 6 Andrew Choi.

215
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:43,630
He's No. 6. Real musicians
will have a head-to-head battle.

216
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:52,660
They're singing songs related to
their dreams. Looking forward to it.

217
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:59,240
Judges' commentaries are important
as well as the viewers' votes.

218
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,300
Please place your votes
actively and carefully.

219
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,760
Boom will explain the
voting system in detail.

220
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,310
Hi, I'm MC Boom.

221
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:20,180
Season 2 introduces
a 1:1 battle system.

222
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:26,530
I'm also curious who will
pass in the 1st broadcast.

223
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,940
If you want to see your
favorite in the next round...

224
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,080
You must vote.

225
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:47,330
First, select the messaging
icon and text #0606.

226
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,730
Type their name or number in
the message and press send.

227
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,820
Remember one thing.

228
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:02,190
You can vote for more
than one person.

229
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,390
But you can't vote multiple
times for the same person.

230
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,810
You can also vote via
mobile messaging.

231
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:16,820
KPOP STAR Season 2
begins now!

232
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,480
Did all of you get it?

233
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,460
The names must be in Korean,
especially the girl group.

234
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,670
Since voting is in sections, vote
when your favorite is battling.

235
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:37,330
Their fate is in your hands,
and now we begin the battle.

236
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:43,950
1st group is Lee Jin-woo
and Choi Ye-geun.

237
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:46,570
Voting will also
begin now.

238
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,380
[Lee Jin-woo vs Choi Ye-geun]

239
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,690
I felt hopeless and
didn't know what to do.

240
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:05,680
I knew it won't be easy,
but my opponent is...

241
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,720
I don't know. She's
like a genius.

242
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,570
She has the ability to arrange
and such voice at that age.

243
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,520
She's explosive and
has great talent.

244
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,820
Jin-woo practices even
when we're resting.

245
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,510
She practices late at night
when everyone went home.

246
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,310
Lee Jin-woo and
Choi Ye-geun.

247
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,920
Hard worker vs genius?

248
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,250
I don't know
who will win.

249
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,730
From what we've seen yet,
Ye-geun is much superior.

250
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,910
But Jin-woo's last
stage was shocking.

251
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:54,120
Jin-woo competes with a voice
that moves people's hearts.

252
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,390
I wanted to sing a gayo where
I could convey the lyrics.

253
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,810
[What song did the genius
and hard worker choose?]

254
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,500
[A plaintive breakup song
Kim Bum-soo's "Sad Inflection"]

255
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,000
[The best song to beat
her greatest opponent!]

256
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,390
I only thought of making
it to the live broadcast.

257
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,100
Who's less tense and does
better is more important.

258
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,930
I hope I go to
the next round.

259
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,350
[No. 1 Lee Jin-woo]

260
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,750
[Sad Inflection - Kim Bum-soo]

261
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:25,170
Another hand since she must've
been nervous for going first.

262
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,170
This stage was by
No. 1 Lee Jin-woo.

263
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,270
Choi Ye-geun is
a born genius.

264
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,930
Her arrangements
are unexpected.

265
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,250
What's even amazing
is that she's 17.

266
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,110
I did many arrangements
while on KPOP STAR.

267
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:59,880
I'm ashamed because
I can't read music.

268
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,020
[She can't read music
but arranges?]

269
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,390
[How does she arrange?]

270
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,760
I use symbols only
I understand.

271
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,800
[Ad-lib line is
a wavy line]

272
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,800
[Words get bigger
for crescendo]

273
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,850
[Genius's arrangement notes
realized through self-study]

274
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,940
My original dream was
to be a dancing singer.

275
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,240
There used to be a huge
mirror in the house.

276
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,950
I always danced and
practiced in front of it.

277
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:43,330
Seeing BoA sing and dance on
television gave me that dream.

278
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,900
So the music I
chose is BoA's...

279
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,740
"Girls on Top".

280
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,940
I'm getting scared.
Why my song again?

281
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,340
It's unpredictable.

282
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,020
I'm going to show you a
different style than before.

283
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,330
Please be kind and
look forward to it.

284
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,020
[No. 2 Choi Ye-geun]

285
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:20,630
[Girls on Top - BoA]

286
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,550
This was an intense
stage by Choi Ye-geun.

287
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,700
Who will be the victor
of this 1:1 battle?

288
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:31,150
I watched them during rehearsal,
but they were more nervous now.

289
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,220
What do the judges think?
Let's hear the commentary.

290
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,390
You must've been very nervous
since you were first today.

291
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:56,730
And you didn't show 100%
of your skills due to that.

292
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:01,590
In Jin-woo's case,
who started first...

293
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:07,680
The live broadcast could be
called the battle of nerves.

294
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:21,440
Jin-woo chose a song true to
her feelings to do well, but...

295
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,880
Your will was too far ahead,
and during the middle break...

296
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:33,600
You had to get the correct
pitch during the silence.

297
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,280
It's a pity how the sound
and voice didn't match.

298
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,090
My song was reinterpreted
by Choi Ye-geun.

299
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:49,420
I was amazed at how you
made it funky in a rock style.

300
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,840
I never saw you dance
while singing.

301
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,970
It was good to see you
take on a new challenge.

302
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,590
I felt, "She has nerves of
steel and doesn't tremble."

303
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,410
I enjoyed it.

304
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,540
That was BoA's commentary.

305
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,260
Lee Jin-woo, your
clothes are beautiful.

306
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,680
The clothes look good on
you, but most importantly...

307
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,660
The song didn't suit you.

308
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:28,360
On the other hand, I wanted
Ye-geun to wear slimmer clothes.

309
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,090
Just as Bang Ye-dam
sang without the guitar...

310
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,840
You dancing while singing
without the keyboard...

311
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,970
Shocked me as much
as Bang Ye-dam did.

312
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,840
The clothes didn't suit
you, but the song did.

313
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,270
The clothes and song were
opposite for the both of you.

314
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,890
Good job.

315
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,210
That was YG's
opinion. And JYP?

316
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,530
I looked forward to
this battle the most.

317
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:03,030
It was a close match
as expected.

318
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,810
They said many good things
so I'll say some bad things.

319
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:11,430
I was worried when Jin-woo
started singing because...

320
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,590
Her shoulders were up
the moment she started.

321
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,660
It's impossible to have a
good sound in that position.

322
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:24,010
If you were relaxed, you could have
done that at an important point.

323
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,510
Because you were tense
from the beginning...

324
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,750
It made no difference
later at the climax.

325
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,490
You tried to be clear
with your pronunciation.

326
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,930
You couldn't convey the feeling
since it didn't feel like speaking.

327
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:41,500
It's a pity that you
tried to do too well.

328
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,190
But your explosiveness at
the high notes were great.

329
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,370
I think differently from
YG about Choi Ye-geun.

330
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:53,880
It was great when you were
at the keyboard. It was soulful.

331
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,680
It changed to pop later, but
you still sang in soul.

332
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,290
You were behind
the beats.

333
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,810
Important thing is to be in
rhythm, not how well you sing.

334
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,970
You tried to show many things
and didn't understand the genre.

335
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,390
Thank you very much.

336
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,980
As much as they were first,
they must've been nervous.

337
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,740
We heard some mixed
commentaries.

338
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:26,950
Who is the victor
of this battle?

339
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:30,060
Please announce the victor.

340
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,660
I'll go first.

341
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:45,740
The victor chosen
by YG is...

342
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,740
- Choi Ye-geun.
- It's Choi Ye-geun!

343
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,790
YG chose Choi Ye-geun.
Must feel stable.

344
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,430
Next?

345
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:01,550
The victor chosen
by SM is...

346
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,610
SM chooses...

347
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,200
- The victor is Choi Ye-geun.
- It's Choi Ye-geun!

348
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,270
Now it's decided that she
goes to the next round.

349
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,140
And who did you
choose, JYP?

350
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,580
JYP also chose
Choi Ye-geun.

351
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:26,620
Choi Ye-geun is the 1st
to make it to the TOP8.

352
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,680
Congratulations!

353
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,710
Jin-woo put on a great
stage though nervous.

354
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,120
Unfortunately, you lost
but it's not the end.

355
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,100
This isn't the final decision.
After next week's battle...

356
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,900
You have a chance to return
and there's the viewers' votes.

357
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,890
So have hope.

358
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,690
They were tense
the 1st battle.

359
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:59,300
The 2nd 1:1 battle is
YouU and Sung Soo-jin.

360
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,290
[YouU vs Sung Soo-jin]

361
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,080
Five against one?

362
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,880
You can't underestimate even
Sung Soo-jin's presence.

363
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,070
This happened since
you chose me!

364
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,730
I'm just imitating.

365
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,820
She's worried and afraid
that she's up against us.

366
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,310
Why?

367
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,130
First, there's five of us...

368
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,850
Is it okay for me
to say this?

369
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,590
These pretty girls...

370
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,690
She said it!

371
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,230
She said why does she have
to go against pretty girls.

372
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,080
We don't think so.

373
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:56,940
We prepared
2NE1's "Ugly".

374
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:04,060
There was a time when
we were all ugly.

375
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,300
Including KPOP STAR, I went
to more than 50 auditions.

376
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:11,190
There was a time when
I was fat and ugly.

377
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,330
I didn't know how to make
myself pretty and shut myself.

378
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,380
I couldn't say that I
wanted to be a singer.

379
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,580
I almost debuted
in a girl group.

380
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,760
I was treated as an
invisible person.

381
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:35,510
Each of us came
together as a group.

382
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:41,860
After coming together, I think
we are a more powerful group.

383
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:44,650
I don't think I could
come this far alone.

384
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,400
We really practiced a lot.

385
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,320
We all improved and
I think we will win.

386
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,570
We could win
with our energy.

387
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,640
Soo-jin, let's battle
out of good will.

388
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,000
Let's go, YouU!

389
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,180
[No. 3 YouU]

390
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,600
[Ugly - 2NE1]

391
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,710
Look at the stage! Pay attention
As the day goes by, so does tension

392
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,920
No one can stop us
(I got a boy) Like Girl's Generation!

393
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,870
Hey Hey, I'm 15 years old
I get a five-star rating

394
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,740
Even though I'm young
My potential is like my height, Uh!

395
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:40,710
No need for words, look here
We will seduce you secretly

396
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,540
They're KPOP STAR's girl group.
Their group dance was impressive.

397
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,710
This stage was by
No. 3 YouU.

398
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:37,390
I went to 30th place.

399
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:43,440
Those who started with me
came out on television.

400
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,320
"This could happen." They
were walking a different path.

401
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,590
I envied them.

402
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:56,610
Now that I'm doing that,
I feel very happy.

403
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,350
I always thought this was
the best she could do.

404
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,630
Since Season 1 so...

405
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:16,660
I was sure that it wouldn't
be easy for you to change.

406
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:25,740
But you did really well
and showed I was wrong.

407
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,450
I never heard that
many compliments.

408
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,420
I felt great.

409
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:37,300
My mother cried after
I made it to the TOP10.

410
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,390
She didn't want me to have a
hard time, but she was pleased.

411
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,520
I'm curious how you
will sing ballads.

412
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,450
I will be singing
Ne-Yo's "So Sick".

413
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:02,250
I'm taking this challenge since
many doubt if I could sing R&B.

414
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,780
Never expected it, huh?

415
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,000
I hope she can show again this
time that that wasn't everything.

416
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,600
I now believe that
she could do it.

417
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:17,640
What I couldn't do last season,
I hope to do more this season.

418
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,550
[No. 4 Sung Soo-jin]

419
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:31,510
[So Sick - Ne-Yo]

420
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,150
Soo-jin showed a new side.
YouU, please join her.

421
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,530
Their battle ended.

422
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:10,570
We're curious of the judges'
commentary. Let's hear them.

423
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,080
I'll go first.

424
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:22,540
Sung Soo-jin amazes
me after every round.

425
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:28,730
I didn't expect you to
sing "So Sick" this well.

426
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,320
When you sang "Invitation",
you were very attractive.

427
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,600
Today, you were able to
show the song's features.

428
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,450
YouU did as much
as expected.

429
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,070
But I want to give some advice
apart from your performance.

430
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:50,890
When you practiced at YG,
you didn't get good results.

431
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,740
You got good results when
you practiced for the rematch.

432
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,630
Today's stage was good,
but there's one problem.

433
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:02,280
You tried to show
too many things.

434
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:10,260
2NE1's charm is enjoying
it with less choreography.

435
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:17,470
You weren't able to enjoy since
there was a lot of choreography.

436
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:23,030
I could say that since you're
my singers. You both did well.

437
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:27,280
That was YG's commentary.
Let's hear the next one.

438
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:38,840
What amazed me about YouU is
that So-yeon's singing improved.

439
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:48,730
The ones who improve after
every round are different.

440
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:54,960
I think today's stage was
difficult for Song Ha-ye.

441
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:02,250
You sang the high notes alone
and were in a hurry later.

442
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:09,180
I hope your skills as a team
improve to share the burden.

443
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,970
I liked the performance where
the others held a member's mike.

444
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:23,600
Sung Soo-jin removed the old
feel and is maintaining it well.

445
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:31,760
Your voice is in a bad condition, but
you delivered your charming voice.

446
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,700
The dance was unexpected, but
I liked the moves. I enjoyed it.

447
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:43,170
That was BoA's commentary.
Last is JYP's commentary.

448
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,040
When we start a new girl group or
boy band, they're somewhat formed.

449
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,770
They're almost ready
before they start.

450
00:47:54,770 --> 00:48:00,930
We saw YouU being formed
and will have shortcomings.

451
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:07,050
Regardless of your shortcomings,
your improvements draw us in.

452
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,110
There's this personal
appeal that pulls us in.

453
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:15,180
Sung Soo-jin did
very well today.

454
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,860
Until the high notes.
You did well until then.

455
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,560
But your throat
hurts, right?

456
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,080
You knew you couldn't
sing the high notes.

457
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:32,670
You started to squeeze it out
thinking you can't do it.

458
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,170
The problem was your
old habits resurfaced.

459
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,630
I enjoyed it.

460
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,370
Thank you very much.

461
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:44,220
Both YouU and Sung Soo-jin
received good commentaries.

462
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:50,540
Let's hear the announcement
for the victor of this battle.

463
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,800
I'll go first.

464
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,140
The victor
chosen by SM...

465
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:03,640
It was hard to choose.

466
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,180
The victor is YouU.

467
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,150
Congratulations, YouU!

468
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:14,470
BoA chose YouU.
Next?

469
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,340
You would have anticipated this
after hearing my commentary.

470
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,180
The victor
chosen by YG...

471
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,340
YG chose...

472
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,220
Do you know
who it is?

473
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:37,580
- Sung Soo-jin.
- It's Sung Soo-jin!

474
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:50,070
Now it all depends on JYP's
choice. You must feel burdened.

475
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:59,170
It was very hard
for me to choose.

476
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:04,400
Since I need to choose,
after some hesitation...

477
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:16,280
Who am I curious about? Who
do I want to see improved?

478
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,340
- The victor chosen by JYP...
- The victor is...

479
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:23,230
- YouU.
- Congratulations, YouU!

480
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,920
They pass to the
next round.

481
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,690
Congratulations.
I see they're happy.

482
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:34,370
Soo-jin, don't be disappointed.
You still have a chance.

483
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:38,440
You will get another chance
through the viewers' votes.

484
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,700
And also through the
judges' wildcard.

485
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,090
Good job on the
splendid battle.

486
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:52,130
The next 1:1 battle is between
Akdong Musician and Andrew Choi.

487
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:57,000
[Akdong Musician vs Andrew Choi]

488
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,110
I resented my hand for
pulling out his name.

489
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:05,340
We're against Andrew,
the best in ad-lib.

490
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:16,180
[Even the judges are speechless
at this unpredictable battle]

491
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,090
The factor that decides
this battle is clear.

492
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:26,140
It all depends on the song
chosen by Akdong Musician.

493
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,420
[What will they sing?]

494
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,900
[Lee Soo-hyun (3)]

495
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:35,420
[Lee Chan-hyuk (6)]

496
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:39,590
My dream was to be a
celebrity since a child.

497
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,460
I liked music
since I was young.

498
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,430
I feel great when
people watch me.

499
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:53,480
I wanted to be a dancing singer
then someone who sang ballads.

500
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,390
My dream of being a
singer didn't change.

501
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:05,410
I liked drawing, dancing, and
wasn't bad at my studies.

502
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:09,830
As I started composing, we applied
for KPOP STAR and reached TOP10.

503
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,400
Our dream is getting bigger.

504
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:17,250
I want to be a singer
and a songwriter.

505
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,160
Now my dream is certain.

506
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:28,350
The song we're singing
is "Is It Ramen?".

507
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:32,660
They told us after picking
us at the battle audition...

508
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,570
"Do what you're good at
and feel confident about."

509
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,300
"Is It Ramen?"
popped up.

510
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:42,290
I want ramen now.

511
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:46,660
There's going to be a
difference on the big stage.

512
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:51,310
The music stays, but other
things must be strengthened.

513
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,190
I think our colors have
to stand out more.

514

I'm drawing characters
to be shown on screen.

515
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,990
We lost to Ye-dam at
the battle audition.

516
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:08,430
Since we tasted defeat,
we don't want to lose.

517
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:14,900
We want our stage like
that in rounds 1 and 2.

Is there anything to eat?

521

Oh! We have ramen again?

Today is Confession Day
Everyone is confessing

525
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,240
I confessed my faults
To my friend

526

I slept over 12 hours but still sleepy
Every day's the same, I'm sick of myself

527

I'm tired of walking so I lay down
I don't need a rag since it's clean

528
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,740
It's cleaning. One folded egg
A welcome sight on the table

529

It's a pie in the sky

530

I open the cupboard every day
I find yesterday's half-eaten

I'm excited

536
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:58,250
I didn't brush my teeth and played
I regret it when it's night

537
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:25,500
This is not how I feel
So many things to do

538
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,850
I want to put my mind
Spend a meaningful minute

539
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:34,760
Television is on all day
It's filled with laughter

540
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,950
My reflection on the television
I'm gradually becoming obese

[The next day after

549
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,720

very awkward.

[Andrew doing vocal exercise
amidst the awkward atmosphere]

551
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:09,690
He's doing that. Maybe he was
trying to make me feel small.

552
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:16,020
No! That's not it!

553
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,960

will do well!

[His parents cheer
him from the States]

555
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,690
I prepared G-Dragon's
"That XX".

556
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:19,820
This is in a funky style,
but I changed it to R&B.

557
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:22,630

558
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,690

that sways women's hearts.

01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:58,880
Can he pass beating
Akdong Musician?

564
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,150
Let's hear the commentary from
the judges on their thoughts.

565
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:18,160
How Akdong Musician made the
stage into a pot looked cute.

566
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:25,280
It was good to see your
bright energies again.

567
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:31,100
I was able to hear Soo-hyun's
high notes. I enjoyed it.

568
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:40,860
Andrew Choi has a sweet
voice and it was good.

569
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:48,430
I think you had fear in
the high notes midway.

570
01:02:48,430 --> 01:02:58,180
You were slightly off key, but
I applaud you for finishing it.

571
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:04,600
It's hard to compare them since
they have different charms.

572
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,740
This is really hard.

573
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:11,720
BoA's commentary
was that it was hard.

574
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,710
They're evenly matched.
Next commentary?

575
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:23,670
Many viewers, including myself,
waited for your mischievous side.

576
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:29,630
You expressed "12PM" in
the lyrics as "12 hours".

577
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:35,590
"Half-eaten" and "My future
is like this swollen ramen."

578
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:40,800
The lyrics are very witty
and they are at key places.

579
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:46,830
It has to come together
and move the people.

580
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:50,860
But it wasn't as
moving as expected.

581
01:03:50,860 --> 01:04:01,040
The most touching song Andrew
sang was BoA's "Only One".

582
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,660
But G-Dragon's "That XX"
was more touching for me.

583
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:13,720
Since BoA's a good singer, and
you sang in a different style...

584
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:18,490
G-Dragon's a rapper. His
individuality is in his songs.

585
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:24,740
Just as JYP said, I don't
know if his voice was open.

586
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:28,910
But I like those high
notes that were closed.

587
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:34,390
I almost had the chills
because it was good.

588
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:38,930
I was thankful there was someone
who could express it like this.

589
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:41,630
I enjoyed it.
Good job.

590
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:45,740
That was some good
commentary he received.

591
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:48,210
Next is by JYP.

592
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:52,980
Akdong Musician's songs
always make me tilt my head.

593
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:59,740
The 2nd chord in the beginning
is something composers don't use.

594
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:03,780
I always spend 30 seconds,
"What was that chord?"

595
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,290
Even now, I'm not sure.

596
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:09,440
Except for that, the rest
are in a money chord.

597
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,820
The rest are in a popular form
except for that slight twist.

598
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,360
It's an exceptional
skill in composition.

599
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:25,100
High chances of getting a
hit song by doing that.

600
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,580
From that view, it
was well-composed.

601
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:31,220
You composed well, but
one unfortunate thing...

602
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:34,460
We couldn't understand it
until we read the lyrics.

603
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,780
There were too many words.
Next time, make it less.

604
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:43,400
So we don't need to read the
lyrics. It's a waste of good lyrics.

605
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:49,180
I personally root
for Andrew Choi.

606
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,560
I also want to continue
singing on stage.

607
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,850
I want to see you on
stage as a great singer.

608
01:05:57,850 --> 01:06:02,350
One of the reasons why
that never happened...

609
01:06:02,350 --> 01:06:13,650
Singing with your throat narrows
the amount of people you can move.

610
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:21,670
If you open your voice,
you have no weaknesses.

611
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,220
Thank you very much.

612
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:30,720
JYP liked them both, but
they had some to be desired.

613
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,650

what that chord was.

Next please.

622
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:34,370
I had to consider the music and
composition for Akdong Musician.

623
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:39,070
It's hard to decide who's
better with singing alone.

624
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:45,820
Considering music and composition,
JYP choses Akdong Musician.

625

It's Akdong Musician!
It's neck and neck!

626
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:55,960
It now depends on
BoA who passes.

627
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,400

but I'm curious.

it's too early to give up.

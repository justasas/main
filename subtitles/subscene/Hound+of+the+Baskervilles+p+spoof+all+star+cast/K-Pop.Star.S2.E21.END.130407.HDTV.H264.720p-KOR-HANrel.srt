[A drama showing how dreams
are turned into reality]

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,040
There were a lot of amazing contestants
that showed us different colors and styles.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,810
[Amazing contestants with
a variety of talents!]

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:27,130
Will we ever find such diverse contestants
as we did in this season's K-POP STAR?

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:35,030
To be able to find potential where others
did not see, that is the most rewarding.

6
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,750
An unimaginable challenge
for our friends..

7
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,110
Also, a leap for those who haven't
been able to get much experience.

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,490
While watching these auditions,
it's just like a drama.

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,500
I'd like to think that the main point of
K-POP STAR is to find talented individuals..

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:01:00,150
That can go outside of Korea and grab the
attention of the world, 2-3 years later.

11
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,430
Finally today..

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,020
Another K-pop star
will be born!

13
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,630
I wish that you give them
your whole-hearted support.

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Survival Audition
K-POP STAR Season 2!

15
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,200
The anticipated, final stage where
our current finalists will compete!

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,780
Let me introduce the three judges that
have been with us for the past 8 months..

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,360
Yang Hyun-suk of YG!

18
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,680
BoA of SM!

19
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,950
Park Jin-young of JYP!

20
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,190
They are more determined than
ever since this is the finals.

21
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,060
Our audience members, please give
them a large round of applause!

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:15,450
Hello! I'm your MC, Yoon Do-hyun, for the
Survival Audition of K-POP STAR Season 2!

23
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:21,970
This show started a lot of talk and
created twists the past 8 months.

24
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,250
At last, the anticipated final
stage has now begun!

25
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:35,470
From today's stage, a new star
from K-POP STAR Season 2 will emerge..

26
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,600
They're the youngest, yet strongest two teams
that overcame their competition to be here.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,640
Making history in this audition,
let me introduce you to the TOP 2!

28
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,140
Our first runner-up..

29
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,450
Making a clean sweep in each audition
round and made it all the way here.

30
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,840
He may be small, but he's the youngest
in audition history to make TOP 2..

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,190
Bang Ye-dam!

32
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:20,140
Our second runner-up is shaking
up the Korean music scene..

33
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,020
Teenaged singer-songwriter..
Charming brother-sister duo..

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,720
Akdong Musician!

35
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,630
The cheers from the crowd
are pouring in!

36
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,890
Let's give another big round
of applause for the TOP 2 finalists!

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,270
I think Ye-dam
is really scary.

38
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,410
I think Akdong Musician
are really scary.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,300
Congratulations, Bang Ye-dam!

40
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,810
He's constantly developing..
Each performance gets a good reaction..

41
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,990
How did you even write lyrics
with these kind of ideas?

42
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,020
I think of you two
as very precious to me.

43
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,820
Music-wise, Akdong Musician
are definitely at the top.

44
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,740
They persevered after
many turnovers.

45
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,810
- He was so good.
- Man, Ye-dam..

46
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,280
At one round, Ye-dam won..
Another, they performed together as Akhachu..

47
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,870
And it just so happens, that
these two are now at the finals..

48
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,710
A cruel fate?

49
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,010
How well will
Ye-dam sing?

50
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,890
Or will it be Akdong
Musician's musicality?

51
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,310
Ah, it's difficult..

52
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,820
[Who will become
the final winner?]

53
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,230
The audience is wilder than
ever. Give me a shout!

54
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,430
- Yang Hyun-suk!
- Yes?

55
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:58,650
How are you? So, the final
stage remains today..

56
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,130
I'm sure you're filled with memories after you've
watched over these entrants all the way through..

57
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,600
How do you feel right now?

58
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,500
It's been about 5 or 6 months..

59
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,740
K-POP STAR Season 2 had its run
and today is the final stage..

60
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,300
Frankly for me, even if
K-POP STAR ends today..

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,340
I feel K-POP STAR will still be
continuing even a year from now..

62
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,370
Because the entrants here today are going
to debut and then continue to be active..

63
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:29,540
Even when I saw Lee Hi or Park Ji-min,
I thought of them as K-pop stars in the past..

64
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,420
Whether these finalists take
1st or 2nd place today..

65
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,270
I just hope to inspire them to bring
a new energy to the music world.

66
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,210
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:46,490
With today being the final stage,
our finalists will be performing 2 songs..

68
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,910
Alright, today's mission!
I'm sure you're all curious..

69
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,870
BoA, could you tell us
what is taking place today?

70
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,010
They will each choose a song the
other sang during this audition.

71
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:03,050
Simply, you could call it a very
distinguished, final mission..

72
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:11,470
Since you've already sang your rival's music,
it's important how you would interpret the music..

73
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:20,340
And finally, you will perform a song
that one of us judges has chosen.

74
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,290
Got it. And that makes the
two songs they'll be performing.

75
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,930
- Now, Park Jin-young!
- Yes?

76
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,090
Our TOP 2 finalists are
both very young entrants..

77
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:36,330
I'd like to ask for a word of encouragement
so that today's performances will go well.

78
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,910
What I can offer you
as your senior..

79
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:48,430
People will surely forget who was
1st or 2nd place after a few years..

80
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,260
It's not what rank you placed
in that they remember..

81
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:55,550
But the songs you sang and the impressions
left by your performances that they'll remember..

82
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:00,930
So don't worry about which rank you'll
place but have a good time while performing.

83
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,840
That's sincerely appreciated,
thank you very much.

84
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,490
I'll also ask the judges to be
fair and careful today as well.

85
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,490
Now, before we start today's final stage,
we have something special from our TOP 2..

86
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,710
Let's check it out right now!

Hello! Why are there cameras?

89
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:31,480
Today, we're going to have a
pop-up performance on the street.

90
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,110
- If I knew this, I'd clean up beforehand!
- Oh my goodness!

91
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,400
- I didn't even do my hair or make-up!
- No way..

92
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,800
The reason why we're doing
a surprise performance..

93
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,070
We'll leave the final
stage aside for now..

94
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,160
And we're going to go
back to the basics..

Ah, I wish I could change my clothes.

110

Soo-hyun, what're you
doing right now?

112

You con-artist!

113

What do you mean con-artist?!

114

TOP 2 pop-up performance?]

118

How many people are there?

119
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,070
I don't know, either.

120
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,120
There could even be no one.

121
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,970
That happened to us a long time ago..

122
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,230
- Nobody came.
- There was no one.

123
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,900
So we just sang in the
street by ourselves.

124
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,190
Just shouting into the
air, "How are you!"

125

could be no one today too?]

be just singing]

on a pop-up performance!]

130
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,640
- 1, 2, 3.. Let's go!
- I don't look good today.

131
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,030
If there's no one there at all,
it'd be really funny..

132
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,300
But if there's only a few people
out there, that's embarrassing.

133
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,150
If there's only a few people
I think I'll want to cry!

be a reality?]

- Hello!

Wow..

146

be this many people!

you that came out.

At first, I seriously didn't
think there would be that many..

150
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,000
But there were so many!

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,010
I was so surprised that
I started getting anxious.

present to their audience?]

[How could this..!]

The guitar cord was still plugged
and I was trying to be quick..

160
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,840

with amusement..

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,040
[The girls go wild]

165
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,290
[Ye-dam, it's your sister!]

166
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,690
[Ye-dam, even your auntie's here!]

167
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,200
[A big hit with the girls!]

168
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,280
[He's so cute!]

169
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,180
When I performed in the streets,
I got lots of reactions..

170
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,940
So I think I could do better
during the live broadcast.

171
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,870
[Encore! Encore! Encore!]

172
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:02,250
I didn't know there would be so many
people waiting and cheering us on..

173
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,540
But, I learned that there were many
people that show us support..

174
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,610
And it gives me the strength to do
even better for the final stage.

175
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,990
[We wish the TOP 2 a good fight!]

176
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,900
It seemed like a performance where the
TOP 2 could really sense their popularity..

177
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,230
I hope that you received everyone's energy and
support and put on amazing performances today.

178
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,630
Now, before we really get to the performance,
I'm going to address the finalist's numbers!

179
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,470
Tiny on stage and hard-to-believe
he's only 12; No.1 it's Bang Ye-dam!

180
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,430
Making a fresh jolt in the music world, the
teenaged singer-songwriter; No.2 it's Akdong Musician!

181
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,660
You'll be able to personally vote for
the winner of K-POP STAR Season 2..

182
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,320
MC Boom will go into details

183
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,090

184

Hello everyone!

Everyone, who do you
think will take 1st place?

187
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,640
Bang Ye-dam?
Or Akdong Musician?

188
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,990
We will find out today as you can
personally vote for your favorite..

189
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,060
Here is how you can

193
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,620
I'm sure you all know by now. You

However, multiple votes for the

Also, you may use your messenger

196
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,450
Now, we're not only having
a contest for our TOP 2..

197
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:58,620
We also have special performances that
you won't be able to catch anywhere else.

198
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,470
Stay tuned as we find out who will become
the winner that will go down in history!

199
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:09,310
We also have a welcoming performance.
It's a special stage with the TOP 10!

200
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,440
Also, they're the best stars
to ever appear on K-POP STAR..

201
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,300
Our very own, Miss Park Ji-min is
revealing a new song here today!

202
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,030
Recorded live, this is
K-POP STAR Season 2!

203
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:27,420
The text voting for the
final round has now begun!

204
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,050
[Text voting has begun]

205
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,690
[Text in your votes by entering the
name or number of the finalist]

206
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,370
To determine the winner
of K-POP STAR Season 2..

207
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:49,780
We'll take the total of the judges' scores (70%)
and the viewer's texting votes (30%).

208
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:56,280
Bang Ye-dam and Akdong Musician..
Can we find a winner between the two?

209
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,950
Starting from now, the fate of those two teams
are hanging as the final contest unfolds.

210
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,260
First, it's the final mission of K-POP STAR
where they will sing one of each other's songs..

211
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:13,790
Each team will pick a song that the other
team sang throughout the audition..

212
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,590
Which song will they pick?
And how will they interpret it?

213
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:26,750
But first, picking a song that Akdong Musician
performed, Bang Ye-dam's stage is about to begin!

214
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:32,940
[Last week, after the broadcast]

215
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,030
It's a mission!
I don't want it!

216
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,460
[Mission.. I'm scared..]

217
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,040
[The mission being delivered,
with suspense in the air]

218
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,530
[What could the first mission
of the final round be?]

219
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,180
[Looking it over and over]

220
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:47,490
These are all the songs that
Bang Ye-dam has done so far..

221
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,560
What! No way!

222
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,650
[The same final mission in
Season 1's final stage?!]

223
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,250
[Switch songs?!]
No way!

224
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,640
I was like, "No way! No way!"

225
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,060
"Please don't let it be!"

226
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,450
I was just, astonished.

227
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,790
Ah..
Singing each other's songs..

228
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,710
By making them sing a song from each other,
makes you able to compare those two singers.

229
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:21,420
If they can sing it better than the original
singer, it could be a keypoint for them to win.

230
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,070
Frankly, it's a mission that these
singers would be afraid of the most.

231
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,740
[Ye-dam's expression looks especially gloomy]

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,900
I don't think the songs
we wrote would suit you..

233
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,310
The song I think would
suit you the most..

234
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,520
"One of A Kind"?

235
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,440
What if you did "I Want You Back"
but in your style..

236
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,860
No one's going to think
that you'd do this song..

237
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,220
- How about "Breathe"?
- I don't think "Breathe" would be good..

238
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,890
You know, their originally written
songs received good reviews..

239
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,950
But if I sing those songs again,
there's a chance I could do worse..

240
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,930
It was very hard to pick a song.

241
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,740
[Which song did Ye-dam eventually pick?]

242
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,350
Oh! This suits him well.

243
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,980
This is a song that really
gave me a huge reaction..

244
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,430
This might be difficult for Ye-dam.

245
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,780
Hm..

246
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,790
I'm imagining.. How would Ye-dam
interpret this song?

247
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,990
I think he would do really well!

248
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,380
I know for a fact he'll
do really well!

249
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,540
[Which song did Ye-dam pick that's
mixed with expectations and worries?]

250
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,080
[The song "Officially Missing You"
which gave the most reaction]

251
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,060
A score of 98 points!

252
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,720
95 points!

253
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,130
94 points!

254
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,330
Akdong Musician just received
the most points ever from the judges!

255
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:39,490
I really liked their performance,
when Akdong Musician sang that song..

256
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,890
So I wanted to try that song
but done in my own style.

257
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,200
When Akdong Musician sang this song,
they were telling us a story..

258
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,710
It felt like they
were talking to us..

259
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,670
I think Ye-dam could
give us a different reaction.

260
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:57,340
When Akdong Musician sang
"Officially Missing You"..

261
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,550
Emotionally, it was done in
a slightly sad way..

262
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,120
And even though, there may be
sad times in our memories..

263
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,230
We also have good
memories with us too.

264
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:12,180
As I was doing K-POP STAR,
I got to stand a huge stage..

265
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,090
I got to be on television..
I got to meet a lot of celebrities..

266
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,670
I got to live with older "brothers" and
spend some time away from my parents..

267
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,250
It was a lot of fun.

268
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:33,230
I'd hope that when you hear my song,
you'd remember more happier times.

269
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,560
Ye-dam's Mom: [Akhachu]
Ye-dam's Dad: [I'm happy I have you~*]

270
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,390
[TAMIA - Officially Missing You]

271
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:58,050
Bang Ye-dam just gave us a different take
on Akdong Musician's "Officially Missing You"..

272
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm really curious what the
three judges will score.

273
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:14,930
When you first started and
came out to give your audition..

274
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:22,640
You made us three judges very thrilled
and I couldn't hide my expression..

275
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,240
The reason for bringing that up, is that
I get that same feeling after hearing this.

276
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,010
He plays with the timing..
Singing fast and then slow..

277
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,970
He even plays with the melody..

278
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,560
He changes the melody, but
not into obvious ones.

279
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,480
But it's sung in a way
most people wouldn't imagine..

280
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,540
Also, you play the
harmonica very well..

281
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,490
I think that's what really
makes it your own song..

282
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,380
I think I heard every
type of vocalization..

283
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,060
I heard falsetto, head voice, and even
a little chest voice for the first time..

284
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,340
Gee, I really enjoyed watching
your performance..

285
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,560
Here's JYP's score..

286
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,480
Now for the score.
He got very high praises.

287
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,530
What will JYP's
scoring be?

288
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,280
- 98 points! Wow!
- Thank you!

289
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,550
He got a really high score..

290
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,150
Let's find out the score
from our next judge.

291
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:33,640
My overall commentary after seeing
him the past several months..

292
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,720
He still can't win with
singing alone.

293
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,390
The audience is reacting to
Jin-young's expression..

294
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,040
It's all over his face.

295
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,960
If there was a part that
I thought was really amazing..

296
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,970
When you first opened your song with that voice,
it gave me goosebumps and it was charming..

297
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:01,870
And Bang Ye-dam's key is actually
higher than most guys can sing..

298
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:07,670
Last week, when he sang "Bad Boy" with
Taeyang, he was singing 3 keys higher..

299
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,630
Even in "Where Is The Love?" he
sang it in a women's part in one key..

300
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,750
And even though, there was a slight
flaw in your sound today..

301
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,780
But because I got such a shudder
from listening to your nice voice..

302
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,430
I want to give you a generous
score than one would expect..

303
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,810
Alright, here's YG's score..

304
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,760
If so, what would be that
generous-than-expected score be?

305
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,610
We're going to find out..

306
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,630
- 95 points! That's definitely a high score.
- Thank you!

307
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,130
He must feel great..

308
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:41,540
Lastly, let's find out the
score from SM's judge.

309
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:52,340
Personally, I really liked Ye-dam's
version better than Akdong Musician's.

310
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:56,870
The reason why..

311
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:04,940
Ye-dam's true feelings were
conveyed in the rap lyrics.

312
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,390
He's actually..

313
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:15,440
There's a lot of laughs today
because of Jin-young's expressions.

314
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:25,120
For a 12-year-old to partake in
this 8-month long survival...

315
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,210
I'm sure you went through a lot of
hardships, physically and emotionally..

316
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,490
But your rap was given
while still intact..

317
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,180
And I really loved listening to your
beautiful voice and harmonica playing..

318
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,370
But, when you first started singing
I thought your tone seemed shaking..

319
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,120
So I'll give you a
considerable score..

320
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,150
Here's SM's score..

321
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,560
Here's SM's scoring..
The two judges had given high scores..

322
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,950
- 96 points!
- Thank you!

323
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,620
Bang Ye-dam received a total of
289 points from the three judges!

324
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,500
He received a very high score..

325
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,980
Now, for those who think that Bang Ye-dam
should be the winner of K-POP STAR Season 2..

326
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,400
Please text 'Bang Ye-dam'
or the number '1' to #0606..

327
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,420
That was candidate No.1, Bang Ye-dam!

328
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:17,620
Up next, we're going to see
Akdong Musician's performance..

329
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,310
Let's find out which song of Bang Ye-dam's
had Akdong Musician selected to perform!

330
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,390
How about this one?

331
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,590
I like this one.

332
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,830
"Isn't She Lovely" wouldn't
be so bad either..

333
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,430
"Sir Duke" would be good too..

334
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,150
Since Ye-dam sang
so many good songs..

335
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,580
I always got envious..

336
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,590
Whenever Ye-dam would sing a song,
I'd wonder how I would sing that song.

337
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,980
[I should try that one next time~]

338
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,850
After Ye-dam sang that song,
I couldn't stop singing it..

339
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,660
After hearing Ye-dam, he
thought it sounded so great..

340
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,300
It was just addicting!

341
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,070
[The addicting song Ye-dam sang?]

342
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,390
[Akdong Musician's selected song unveiled]

343
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:05,010
They picked a very suiting song.

344
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,230
[Slightly hesitant JYP]

345
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,650
If Akdong Musician wants to put on
a good performance with this song..

346
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,760
They'll need an entirely
new interpretation..

347
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,150
It may be difficult, but if they can
do it, it'll be that much more amazing.

348
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,990
I don't think it's going to be
an easily predictable performance..

349
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,930
Akdong Musician..
"MMMBop" Hanson..

350
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,390
When I first heard Ye-dam's performance,
I was really shocked and liked him ever since..

351
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,690
You sang so well!

352
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:45,060
When he first sang this, we thought
he was like Michael Jackson.

353
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,450
Akdong..
Ah..

354
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,800
He did almost every stage
without criticisms.

355
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,830
We couldn't find a song
we wasn't good at.

356
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,830
No matter what, the burden
would be just the same.

357
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,820
I can imagine the voice
those two would sing it in..

358
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,190
But since, Ye-dam is by himself
and we have both of us..

359
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,900
We can create a harmony..

360
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,550
I feel like they'd do
much better than me..

361
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,690
Also, for us we have
creative writing..

362
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,670
Ye-dam sings original songs as they are..

363
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:29,030
And he'll be told that he
has a good sense of rhythm..

364
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,670
So I'm going to give it a
new melody and witty lyrics..

365
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,800
And a new arrangement in
an Akdong Musician-style..

366
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,190
I think that will
be our strengths.

367
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,870
It's not going to be easy.

368
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:47,030
But I'm looking forward to it since
Akdong haven't sung much rhythmical songs..

369
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:51,640
To see what kind of new ingenuity
Akdong Musician will show us today..

370
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,200
That's most critical!

371
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,560
Please look forward to
our own take on "MMMBop"!

372
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,990

[Hanson - Mmmbop]

374
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,370
A different take on Bang Ye-dam's
song "MMMBop" by Akdong Musician!

375
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,740
That was very fresh
and fun to watch!

376
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,510
Let's find out how our judges
watched their performances!

377
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:33,570
Personally, out of all the performances
Akdong Musician has done so far..

378
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,150
I don't know if this was their best one,
but I do think it was their most natural one.

379
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:44,070
Frankly, I don't know if it's because
Bang Ye-dam is still 12 years old..

380
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:51,520
I saw him feeling embarrassed
or pressured a few times.

381
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:59,980
Since they were having fun, their
interpretation was different.

382
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,710
Since they're siblings, they were
in perfect step and it was great.

383
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,380
Alright, here's YG's score..

384
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:12,790
A very natural performance..
What score will he give?

385
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,850
The points are climbing up..

386
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,770
Was there an error?

387
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,000
The numbers are going
back up again..

388
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,470
98 points!

389
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,840
That's a very high score.

390
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,190
Let's find out our
next judge's score..

391
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,240
Personally, I really thought
this round was very difficult..

392
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,960
First off, I think Ye-dam's
version gave us a huge reaction..

393
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,110
But for Akdong Musician..

394
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,970
Watching them reach all the way to the final
rounds on live-television was very fun..

395
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:55,320
It was very enjoyable..

396
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:03,180
I enjoyed listening to "MMM Bop" which didn't
remind me of Ye-dam's version at all..

397
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:09,910
I really thought over how Akdong
would sing this very, rhythmic song..

398
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:15,270
But Miss Soo-hyun, sung it with a
great sense of rhythm and modesty..

399
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,710
This one's very hard
for me to evaluate..

400
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,040
Here's SM's score..

401
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,900
Her judging was filled
with lots of compliments..

402
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,470
She said this
one was hard..

403
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,490
96 points!

404
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:30,070
That's definitely a
very high score..

405
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:33,040
Lastly, let's find out
how JYP will judge them..

406
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:41,940
We can't evaluate Akdong on
singing and performance alone.

407
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,640
Firstly, I definitely asked for your own
interpretation of the song "MMM Bop" itself..

408
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,900
This song is usually sung in
a 24-note shuffle rhythm..

409
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,710
But you guys took it and
made it into a 16-note..

410
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,850
And sung that rhythm without any flaws..
I was very surprised by that..

411
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,970
Not only that, combining elements from
your previous songs, all into one song..

412
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,400
Doing that so seamlessly
is a very astonishing feat..

413
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,910
It really makes me think that
I can't overlook this song..

414
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,650
How did your parents
raise you two so well?

415
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:23,010
If I had kids one day, and had them take supplementary
classes, training, private lessons and such..

416
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:25,240
Would they turn out like that?

417
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,920
They're such precious kids!

418
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Here's JYP's score..

419
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,300
JYP's score is climbing up..
What will it be?

420
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,540
97 points!

421
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,950
That gives Akdong Musician a total
of 291 points from the three judges!

422
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,310
For those who think Akdong Musician should
be the winner of K-POP STAR Season 2..

00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,220
It's getting hotter and hotter in here!

426
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,340
Right now, it's a very close match!

427
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,130
There's only two missions left,
who will ultimately become the winner?

428

lead by a few points, with a total of 291!

430
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:25,660
However, that can quickly change..

to get things even hotter..

they first started singing and became a K-pop star..

435
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,550

to this stage..

a song picked by the judges..

I believe they will do their
best since this is the last.

- Why another mission?!
- Really?

[What could this mission be about?]

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:49,210
I think we need to give Ye-dam
something where he can sing more.

00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:52,470
The second mission is a song
recommended by the judges.

460

JYP and I were in the
same waiting room...

464
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,090
We play songs that YG and
I heard when we were young.

465
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,400
During the semifinals, I suddenly
heard this in Bang Ye-dam's voice...

466
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,460
I thought this would be a great
song for Bang Ye-dam to sing.

467
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,820

it for the first time..

It might be hard but
it'll be fun.

00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,850
Hi, Ye-dam. It's me.
Uncle "Pung Pung".

485
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:35,600
You were five when we started
recording "Farting King Pung Pung".

486
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:43,590
I'm proud that you've grown up and
made it to TOP2 on KPOP STAR.

487
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:48,140
Since you tried hard, you
will do well. Go, go, go!

Hey, it's me Sung-jin.

made it to TOP2.

we can play.

491
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,640
You did really well.

492
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,060
Hurry up and win
so we can play.

493
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,320
You can do it!

to win. Go, Bang Ye-dam!

It's me, dad.

There's one more
stage to go.

501
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,210
I don't know if you saw
the sign I always held.

502
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,350
I wrote, "Enjoy music."

503
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:47,480
Whether you win or not,
whatever the results...

504
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,140
I hope you will
just enjoy it.

505
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:54,330
During last week's broadcast...

506
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:01,790
Someone was moved by your singing and said
to us, "Thank you for giving birth to him."

507
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,780
We were proud of you
and touched by that.

508
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:10,190
We're thankful that you
were born as our son.

509
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,890
Let's live happily.
I love you.

510
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,120
- You're a good son.
- Yes you are.

511
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,430
I love you.

512
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,110
Go, Ye-dam!

513
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,190
[He's overwhelmed
and is speechless]

514
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,230
What is this? I thought I was
supposed to monitor my practice.

515
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,960
Mom and dad, thanks for
calling me a good son.

516
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,330
I'll do my best in the final
stage because I'm a good son.

517
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,270
Thank you.

[Karma Chameleon - Culture Club]

519
00:48:54,260 --> 00:49:00,560
We saw his excellent rhythm.
Let's hear the score.

520
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:11,070
Actually, I don't
know this song.

521
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,380
I only know the chorus part.

522
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:20,690
I thought that Ye-dam
would sing it differently.

523
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:29,290
I also thought why you didn't
play your harmonica.

524
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:33,200
It was plain.

525
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,410
I enjoyed it.
SM's score is...

526
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:38,800
She said it was plain,
but what's the score?

527
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,990
- 94 points!
- Thank you.

528
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,170
Let's hear the next score.

529
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,400
I thought the same thing.

530
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:53,770
JYP and I recommended this
because of the harmonica.

531
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,920
We were waiting for the
harmonica, but it ended.

532
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:05,650
Ye-dam's friends came
out on the video clip.

533
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,650
It made me realize
how young he is.

534
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,910
Why did we compliment him?

535
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:19,870
People his age cause trouble
and are hard to control.

536
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:26,760
But he reinterpreted this song
that we heard when we were young.

537
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:34,690
People around BoA's age might not know,
but middle-aged people like JYP and me...

538
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:38,780
This brought back
old memories.

539
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,630
It was great.
YG's score is...

540
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,880
This is YG's score.
What will he give him?

541
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,220
- 93 points!
- Thank you.

542
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,210
That's a high score.
Finally, we have JYP.

543
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:59,640
One amazing thing... those that
learned music from their parents...

544
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:05,420
They sing in an old-fashioned
way because of their parents.

545
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:11,860
Ye-dam learned from his dad,
but he doesn't sound old.

546
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:15,890
It's amazing how polished
he sounds without habits.

547
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,720
Another thing is that melody changes
slightly whatever the melody may be.

548
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,130
Not anyone can do that, especially
when it turns out good.

549
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:27,370
That's amazing about him.

550
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:32,040
But in this song, the music director
and many other things didn't go along.

551
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,260
But Ye-dam sang well.

552
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:42,390
I think we were trying to have our own way
by making him sing an 80s song in a week.

553
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:45,370
But he sang well.
JYP's score is...

554
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:49,820
This is JYP's score. He said
something wasn't right...

555
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,570
- 94 points!
- Thank you.

been hard for you at a young age.

Akdong Musician is next!

569
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,730
For Akdong Musician, we chose
Toy's "Passionate Goodbye".

570
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:59,050
If "Officially Missing You" was
sorrow in their friends leaving...

571
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,060
This is beyond that.

572
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:07,590
This song will give them an overall
feeling what this show meant to them.

573
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:12,100
This will be a mission that will
draw out the best in them.

Even though this is a live

01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,020
I want to be honest.

628
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:58,200
Bang Ye-dam and Akdong Musician's
previous mission was much better.

629
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:10,020
Akdong Musician's "Passionate Goodbye"
was like a final song ending KPOP STAR.

630

"With pencils in hand, we
finished the drawing."

"I hang it in a place
within my heart forever."

not just a lyric.

How can they write
such lyrics?

- I would buy that.
- I know, really...

are beautiful children.

No matter how talented, without efforts and
studying, you'll only go on for 10 years.

651
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:37,850
Most great composers don't
go beyond 10 years.

652
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:42,050
I'm concerned that efforts and
studying will complement your talents.

653
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,310
That's how talented you are.

654
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,910
JYP's score is...

655
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:49,630
That was a heartfelt advice.
And their score is?

656
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:56,160
94 points! That's high.
Finally we have BoA.

657
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,470
This is the last commentary
for KPOP STAR Season 2.

658
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:03,450
I enjoyed their final stage.

659
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:11,540
Like YG, I think the previous mission was
more exciting and showed your talents.

660
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:19,370
In this round, I don't think your
and Ye-dam's stage were great.

661
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:24,350
But one thing is that Chan-hyuk's
rap lyrics were well-written.

662
01:03:24,350 --> 01:03:31,030
It was moving, and just as YG
said that it was like a poem...

663
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:34,960
I give you this score as
I was moved by that part.

664
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,120
SM's score is...

665
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:40,200
She said he writes well,
but what about the score?

666
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,550
95 points!

667
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:45,760
They received a total
of 282 points.

668
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,720
I'll ask them the same question.

669
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,930
Every stage is now over.
How do you feel?

670
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:56,760
- It's bittersweet.
- Bittersweet?

671
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,100
And Chan-hyuk?

672
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:01,370
I wasn't satisfied
with this stage.

673
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:07,320
He feels sorry that it's over,
but you did well until now.

674
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,030
We need to wait
for the results.

675
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:13,240
For those who think Akdong Musician should
be the winner of K-POP STAR Season 2..

676
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,870
Please text 'Akdong Musician'
or the number '2' to #0606..

677
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,390
That was candidate No.2,
Akdong Musician!

678
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:33,480
Now the long-awaited final for
KPOP STAR Season 2 is over!

679
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:39,340
Who will be Season 2's winner?
Will these people know?

680
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:43,310
They had a fierce battle
here last year.

681
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:48,000
Now they returned to us
as genuine K-pop stars.

682
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,220
Welcome Park Ji-min
and Lee Hi!

683
01:04:54,500 --> 01:05:01,490
I'm flabbergasted at how pretty
you became. It's a surprise.

684
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:07,300
They're your juniors on stage.
They must be very nervous.

685
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:12,160
Ji-min, how would you
describe their feelings?

686
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,440
They should be very nervous.
Going from TOP3 to TOP2...

687
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,210
But they did well and I'm
thankful for the great stages.

688
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,480
They should be really nervous.

689
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:28,370
Is there anyone you're
personally cheering for?

690
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:32,570
Well... I'm cheering
for Bang Ye-dam.

691
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:36,250
Really? She sure is honest.

692
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:38,370
Lee Hi is also here.

693
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:42,090
How was it when
compared to Season 1?

694
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:46,850
In skills and charms,
which was better?

695
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:51,810
I recall Season 1 having
many unique contestants.

696
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,820
Season 2 has many contestants
with different charms.

697
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,880
I think it's a close match.

698
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,800
A close match? Okay,
same question.

699
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:03,380
Who do you think will win?

700
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,750
I want both to do well.

701
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,960
Alright, but you might
be thinking of a winner.

702
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:14,870
With familiar faces from
both Seasons 1 and 2...

703
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:17,720
We'll see you next week on
KPOP STAR's dream stage.

704
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,040
Please take interest.

705
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:26,000
We've seen all the stages filled
with their passions and dreams.

706
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,230
It's over. Who is
the victor?

707
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,610
We announce the results!

708
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:42,130
I went to Jamsil Gymnasium
and sang with my dad, but...

709
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:45,280
- He's my son.
- A son?

710
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,030
They thought I was a girl.

711
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:52,130
While on KPOP STAR,
I grew taller...

712
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:57,350
I danced and rapped
for the first time.

713
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,460
It's like a dream.

714
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:07,550
We had no desire in the beginning.
We wanted to see how far we could go.

715
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:12,130
But we became desperate as
we advanced more and more.

716
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:18,070
In Season 1, they cried when
they passed and were eliminated.

717
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:19,800
I couldn't understand that.

718
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,330
Is that something
to cry about?

719
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:27,550
But it's not. You don't know that
feeling if you don't experience it.

720
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:31,810
I was overwhelmed.
Pit-a-pat...

721
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,350
I hope I become a
great singer.

722
01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,310
We didn't know
our potential...

723
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:43,120
This place gave
us a dream.

724
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,160
I think we can start with
this as a steppingstone.

725
01:07:56,130 --> 01:08:00,740
The 8-month long journey of
KPOP STAR Season 2 has ended.

726

Only the results remain.

727
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:10,720
Seeing these young people trying hard and
experiencing things on the big stage...

728
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:15,820
Before being an MC, as their senior
in music, I felt many things.

729
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:18,780
I learned a lot and
also felt sad.

730
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:24,190
I wanted to cheer them,
sing them a song.

731
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:26,620

We're also nervous, and
since Ye-dam did so well...

because I have no regrets.

814
01:21:25,930 --> 01:21:28,370
He's so cute.

815
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:32,440
Do the judges have
anything to say?

816
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:34,650
YG?

817
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:43,560
Akdong Musician are a new discovery
of artists hidden away in Mongolia.

818
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:50,830
As I said before, the stage with
Yoon Do-hyun was memorable.

819
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:57,690
That stage showed how the contestants
shined with a reliable senior with them.

820
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:05,130
I hope to see the winner, runner-up, and
all the contestants in the music scene...

821
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:08,260
If you meet great seniors
and a great agency...

822
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:13,880
You are talented people that will
show an even brighter stage.

823
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,070
All of you guys did really well!

824
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:18,550
Thank you!

825
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:26,570
Next week will be the dream stage where
singers from Seasons 1 and 2 will perform.

826
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:28,250
I'll see you all next week..

827
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:30,660
Thank you!
Thank you all so much!

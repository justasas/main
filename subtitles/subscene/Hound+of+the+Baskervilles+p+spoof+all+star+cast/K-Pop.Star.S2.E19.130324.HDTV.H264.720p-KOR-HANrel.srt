First is Park Jin-young of
JYP and Bang Ye-dam!

5
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,210
They look good.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,310

impressive.

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,050
Looking forward
to his song.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:53,100
Next is Yang Hyun-suk
of YG and 2,000 won!

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,600
We also look forward to 2,000 won
that transformed into YG style.

10
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:10,670
Last of all is BoA of SM, Andrew
Choi, and Akdong Musician!

11
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,500
They look like a team walking out
while holding hands. They look good.

12
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:25,350
Another round of applause to
the TOP4 and the 3 judges.

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,210
This casting audition is
on a different level.

14
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:39,140
We're casting them as if they
are our agency's celebrities.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,150
My goal is to make
both of you pass.

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,870
It's possible.

30
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,490
2,000 won made me think that I
shouldn't make rash judgments.

31
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,420
They took an upturn which
is really something.

32
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,330
I anticipate that they
will make it to TOP3.

33
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,390
Ye-dam is truly
frightening.

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,260
He doesn't sound like Justin
Bieber when singing his songs.

35
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,740
He had his own colors when
singing Michael Jackson's songs.

36
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,170

afraid of anything.

The casting audition prepared by
SM, YG, and JYP starts today.

44
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,350
The agencies devoted all their energy
to form a project team for the TOP4.

45
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:56,810
I anticipate the agencies' battle to
be as fierce as the contestants'.

46
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,270
I believe the judges are more
nervous than the contestants.

- JYP?
- Yes?

48
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,910
Could you tell us the points we
should focus on for their battle?

49

Since this program is
coming to an end...

50
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:20,520
We think, "What if we make
them as one of our artists?"

51

more objectively.

- Alright... YG?
- Yes?

53

When you casted 2,000 won
last week, it was unexpected.

54

Was there any reason
for that decision?

55
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:51,880
They were pointed out the most and
received almost no compliments.

56

My plan is to get them
a lot of compliments.

57

present an enjoyable stage.

Maybe it's because this
is the casting audition.

I don't think it's because
he's a good singer.

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,950
What I want to say
to Andrew is...

168
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,700
A feeling that comforts the heart
or makes us search our memory.

169
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,870
Even though you don't speak Korean
well, you expressed the song well.

170
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:32,110
Since Andrew is too old
to be an idol singer...

171
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,370
I hope you become a singer that makes
the audience search their memory.

at many auditions.

much that I can't speak.

This is why I hate
the casting audition.

Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

272
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:37,800
It's hard to judge a contestant who
received training from another agency.

273
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,550
In other words, it's hard
to say something bad.

274
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:45,320
Does that mean you want
to say something bad?

275
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,430
Bang Ye-dam... No, no.

276
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,530
When I heard he's singing
JYP's "You're the One"...

277
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:57,800
There was a misunderstanding.
"He's making him sing his song?"

278
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,290
But there was a reason.

279
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:05,710
The reason Bang Ye-dam is great, in
my previous commentary, is that...

280
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,170
He's different from the contestants
on "Star King" that imitate adults.

281
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,170
He has skills to compete
with even professionals.

282
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,940
When I heard he's singing that,
I thought he might be in a crisis.

283
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,130
Since this song is fairly new
and there are many moves...

284
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:30,110
I was worried that he
shouldn't look like little JYP.

285
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,710
That is why I said that
earlier as a joke.

286
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,880
Actually, you couldn't
get rid of that image.

287
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,640
Since I view your potential in high
regards, maybe I had a high expectation.

288
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,130
I was expecting the arrangement and
choreography to have changed more.

289
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:50,420
But it wasn't enough.

291
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,910
He said it would've been better
if there was some change.

292
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,780
It's YG's score.

Last is JYP's score
and commentary.

295
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:22,020
It's not easy singing while dancing, and
it's even harder when the tempo is fast.

296
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,720
And it's hard to sing when you dance
with your lower body most of the time.

297
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,880
More than half of the choreography
utilizes the lower part of the body.

298
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:40,000
It's hard to explain this
if you haven't tried it.

difficulty into consideration.

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,180
[He said I'm good]

334
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,590
[And]

335
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:05,700
It's Lee Seung-hoon!
We were surprised.

336
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,960
But seeing him was
sort of like a healing.

337
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,820
Many people compare
me to 2,000 won.

338
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,840
But after hearing
them sing...

339
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,100
I think they will break that
parallel theory today.

340
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,920
[D-3 - mid-term
evaluation]

341
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,690
This is the best from
all the songs you sang.

342
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,780
[Praised]

343
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,320
Wow! It could be fun!
It's groundbreaking!

344
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,720
That selection is like
taking a huge risk.

345
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:46,150
We're singing Shim Soo-bong's
"One Million Roses".

346
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,790
[What's the reason for this
unexpected selection?]

347
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:56,500
We chose this because YG
told us to tell our story.

348
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:03,300
While searching for a song where
we could put in our true hearts...

349
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,220
Unconditional love,
love without hatred...

350
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:12,080
We felt that it was
a mother's love.

351
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,770
If we tell our story through a mother's
love, I think people can relate to it.

352
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,030
"A stream washing over me from the
world like a desert." This is good.

353
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,180
- You wrote this?
- Yes.

354
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,530
This is the first time I thought
you were good at writing lyrics.

355
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,840
- It's really good.
- Thank you.

356
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:39,040
When we were young, we told our
parents we wanted to do music.

357
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,760
Of course, they
were against it.

358
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,380
I was immature then, but I thought
running away would solve everything.

359
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:52,090
I think that is when
we broke their heart.

360
00:34:52,090 --> 00:35:00,890
I want them to feel, "My son is
becoming a singer," and be happy.

361
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:09,750
I didn't express it well, but
I'm grateful and love my mom.

362
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,090
Mother... I'll say mom.

363
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:24,000
Mom, you raised me well until now.
I hope this stage will repay the favor.

364
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,460
I love you, mom.

365
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,320
[One Million Roses - Shim Soo-bong
(arr. by Robin)]

366
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:00,160
At the age of 17, I broke your expectations
I blindly went to the streets for my dreams

367
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,900
I returned home after days of wandering
You were waiting for me with open arms

368
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,210
You embraced me with trusting eyes
Don't chase after my shadows

369
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:17,290
I know your sadness, rest now
The great comfort you raised

370
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,350
You were once a fragrant rose
Your youth withered for me

371
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:57,080
The pain you bore for a thorn like me
But you always and forever smile at me

372
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,360
You're the dam that blocks the
World that's like a flood

373
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,310
You're the stream washing over me
From the world that's like a desert

374
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:16,980
Until a million roses bloom in my life
You're the sun silently shining from above

375
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,910
I always complained without thanks
But you gave everything to me

376
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:28,510
I'll take the burden from your shoulders
Don't worry. I'll close the gates of worries

377
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,240
Stay beside, I'm not good at expressing
Thank you although all was not conveyed

378
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,840
I'll do it all here
For you in this world

379
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,550
It was a touching
stage by 2,000 won.

380
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,330
I'm curious how the
judges heard it.

381
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,260
I'll go first.

382
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:37,000
This was an unexpected
stage by 2,000 won.

383
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:46,250
I read Il'do's rap while
listening. It was well-written.

384
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:56,420
Since it's your story, your use of
empathy was better. It was good.

385
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:07,590
But Hyo-bin's old style of singing
came out even more in this song.

386
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:17,170
That was a pity, but overall it was
amazing that you had this side.

387
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,530
SM's score is...

388
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:23,500
She said it was a new
side. SM's score is...

389
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,130
It's 95! That's high!

390
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,260
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

391
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:40,070
I froze when Hyo-bin
started singing.

392
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:52,070
I pestered Andrew Choi with
vocalization and he changed it.

393
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:58,550
I pestered Hyo-bin with his old
style of singing from the start.

394
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:07,690
He was correcting it a little, but went
back to square one with this song.

395
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,400
I was taken aback at the
introduction and froze.

396
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,470
But I also thought this.

397
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:20,990
He could be first in another
program other than KPOP STAR.

398
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,770
They compared you to last
year's Lee Seung-hoon, but...

399
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:29,130
Putting skills aside, he's like
next generation's singer.

400
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:35,790
His thoughts and expressions
are unlike existing singers.

401
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:42,300
Both of you have exceptional talents,
but you guys are like existing singers.

402
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,140
I think that's the difference
between us and other programs.

403
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,640
JYP's score is...

404
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,580
It's JYP's score. How
much will he give them?

405
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,400
It's 82!

406
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,310
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

407
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,620
It's so tense today.

408
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,870
- I gave Ye-dam a low score.
- Sparks are flying.

409
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:14,310
It seems you're taking
revenge on 2,000 won.

410
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,710
Both of you should
shake hands.

411
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,430
Sparks are flying. I'm sorry to
say this, but it was fun for us.

412
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,320
I'm just joking.

413
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:34,260
Both BoA and JYP said that their singing
is old-fashioned. They said it many times.

414
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,470
But I don't agree
today because...

415
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,710
Shim Soo-bong's
song is even older.

416
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:49,840
I told 2,000 won...

417
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:53,940
I told them to forget the singing
style since this song is old.

418
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,560
Just sing in the old-fashioned
way as much as you want.

419
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,570
Changing your singing style and
vocalization isn't important.

420
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,800
Do you change a trot
into an R&B?

421
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,180
No, right?

422
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:13,940
I thought Hyo-bin's old-fashioned
way would go along with this song.

423
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:20,540
It's a pity that you were nervous.
I thought you would do better.

424
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,790
You don't need anything else
in this song about a mother.

425
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,190
The feeling the lyrics
gave was touching.

426
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:31,070
It was a good stage where
I thought of my mother.

427
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,640
YG's score is...

428
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,480
It's YG's score. I'm
really curious.

429
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,340
It's 88!

430
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,360
The judges' score is 265.

431
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,230
If you think 2,000 won's
stage was good...

432
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:53,500
Please text #0606 with
"2,000 won" or "No. 3".

433
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,380
This stage was by
No. 3 2,000 won.

434
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,610
Now we have the
last TOP4 stage.

435
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:05,720
SM and Akdong Musician worked for
the first time. I wonder how it was.

436
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,550
It starts now!

437
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,550
[Gets the highest judges' score
Akdong Musician is moving up!]

438
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:18,920
[Got casted to SM
for the first time!]

439
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:23,640
[What if SM's colors are added
on to Akdong Musician?]

440
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:27,020
Do you know 10cm's...

441
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,500
"Love in the Milky Way Cafe"?

442
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,950
- Yes, I know.
- I know.

443
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:32,210
- You know that?
- Yes.

444
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:34,410
I started writing songs
because of that song.

445
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:38,060
Really? I think we're on
the same wavelength.

446
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:48,550
The first song I wrote after
hearing that song is "Galaxy".

447
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:51,570
Then I wrote many
more afterwards.

448
00:44:52,310 --> 00:45:03,230
I like the song, but I was worried
where to start in arranging.

449
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,240
That went on for two
days without eating.

450
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,360
Then we had a
meeting with BoA.

451
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,370
She said many good things
and that gave me ideas.

452
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:23,230
You could connect the titles of
your hit songs and write a rap.

453
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:28,330
"I met Soo-hyun at the Milky Way
Cafe and she was attractive."

454
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,350
"Brother, don't cross your
legs. That's disgusting."

455
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,720
Or Soo-hyun likes
some guy in a cafe.

456
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,790
[Oh]

457
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,560
But her brother is
keeping her in check.

458
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:46,220
Yesterday I wore a dress and he said,
"Your dress is getting shorter."

459
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,400
You're old-fashioned.

460
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:55,740
She should take care of herself, but
she spreads her legs when sitting.

461
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:02,390
It's unfair. He says to me why
am I always around guys.

462
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,600
But wherever I go, there
are always guys around me.

463
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,870
But she's different when
she's with me and not.

464
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,470
- When?
- You did.

465
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,970
Akdong are just mischievous.
That's what they are.

466
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:29,490
A freshness and cuteness that
people around their age can show.

467
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,990
I want their colors
to become brighter.

468
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,670
[But one problem...]

469
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,940
But we don't know what
a Korean style cafe is.

470
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,810
[They don't know?]

471
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:44,340
- Where is it?
- Milky Way Cafe is...

472
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,010
Does it even exist?

473
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,050
I think that's it.

474
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,920
[Milky Way Cafe was the
motif of the original song]

475
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:03,090
Even 10cm wrote their
song in this place.

476
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,730
I think I could write good
lyrics receiving that vibe.

477
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,770
I'm sorry to them, but...

478
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:15,790
Their pain gives
us great joy.

479
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:20,500
So we always expect
something from them.

480
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,900
[Love in the Milky Way Cafe - 10cm
(arr. by Hwang Chan-hee)]

481
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,800
It's him again today
Sleeping Lee Soo wakes up

482
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,780
She turns around when a man appears
Practices on making sheep eyes

483
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:05,490
You are double-faced
Everyone adores you

484
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:09,250
I'm not jealous
I just hate you

485
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,240
You clumsily crossed your legs
But it makes you look wealthy

486
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,160
Your disgusted look at the menu
Makes you look attractive

487
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,130
Why don't you snap out of it?
Hey ugly! We need to get our act

488
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,940
The coffee water's not hot
My nagging is in crescendo

489
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:39,400
US, Canada, Ulan Bator, Mongolia
I can't fly to those places

490
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:59,130
It comes after listening to
Akdong Musician's song

491
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,260
Their witty ideas stood out.
It was like seeing a musical.

492
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,950
We're curious of their
score and commentary.

493
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,160
YG and I fear
BoA the most.

494
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:03,220
She always brings out the best
in the people she works with.

495
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,840
So I took her out to drink
several weeks ago.

496
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,380
I was afraid that those
skills would come out.

497
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,730
Andrew Choi's stage
was the best today.

498
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,690
It was a repertorie where he
showed everything he could.

499
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:30,240
But Akdong Musician's repertoire didn't
have a chance to bring something out.

500
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:38,770
You didn't do anything wrong, but
you didn't have room to explode.

501
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,580
I enjoyed it.

502
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:46,670
Let's see JYP's score.

503
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,770
What will he
give them?

504
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,390
It's 85!

505
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:55,000
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

506
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:01,920
It's hard to
score them.

507
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,170
I thought for
a long time.

508
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:11,500
As I watched them the
past several months...

509
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:17,970
As producers, we want to change
contestants like this and that.

510
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:24,860
We tested their limits even in
last year's casting audition.

511
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:29,610
But the result? We should
leave Akdong Musician alone.

512
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:33,430
They're unique.

513
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:37,170
BoA, have you tried
"chapaguri"?

514
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,360
- A few years ago.
- Really?

515
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,560
I tried it in my 20s.

516
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,280
- Have you?
- No.

517
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:48,300
- Did you find out recently?
- Yes. I just found out.

518
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,460
There's none like Akdong Musician
in the exciting gayo world.

519
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:59,900
There was a news article titled,
"What are you, Akdong Musician?"

520
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,720
That's right.

521
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:08,440
If I call this song theirs,
it can be their song.

522
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,350
But since they showed many
good things with their songs...

523
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:22,010
I think they shine more when they sing
their song and not someone else's.

524
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,010
YG's score is...

525
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,880
It's YG's score. What
will he give them?

526
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,100
It's 88!

527
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,620
Last is SM's score
and commentary.

528
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,800
I don't agree with
their commentaries.

529
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:46,980
It's because I wanted something
from Akdong Musician.

530
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:54,510
They always shrank from the burden of
their songs. How could I make them enjoy?

531
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:59,850
What song could draw out the
liveliness in teenagers?

532
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:03,630
The point of this song was
actually Chan-hyuk's rap.

533
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:09,280
The lyrics were great, everything was
great, but why did you forget the lyrics?

534
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,360
That was a pity, but I was satisfied
even though I made this stage.

535
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,590
I'll give a good score.
SM's score is...

536
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,890
What score is
a good score?

537
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:25,160
SM's score is 95!

538
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,790
The judges' score is 268.

539
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,540
If you're rooting for
Akdong Musician...

540
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:36,800
Please text #0606 with
"Akdong Musician" or "No. 4".

541
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:40,570
This stage was by No. 4
Akdong Musician. A hand.

542
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:50,030
Now all the TOP4
stages are over.

543
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:56,690
According to the judges' score,
2,000 won has the highest...

544
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:02,360
I'm sorry, Andrew Choi
has the highest score.

545
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,840
But we don't know
the results yet.

546

But your votes will
determine their fate.

547

We'll give you one last chance to
vote as you watch the highlight clip.

548

will be over soon.

The winner of KPOP STAR

A cash prize of $300,000

553
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:42,750

compact premium sedan.

Voting is now over.

555
00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:59,240
We'll soon have the
total score, right?

556
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,990
That's right.

557
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:04,280
While it's being tallied, we
have a special performance.

558
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,650
Boom, please tell us.

559
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:10,640
Since we're here together,
you might have expected it.

560
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Increase the volume and
just enjoy the show.

561
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:24,440
The TOP4 got into two teams
and prepared a special stage.

562
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,720
That's right. Looking
forward to it.

563
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:31,660
First, Akdong Musician and
Bang Ye-dam are in a team.

564
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,760
Do you know their
group's name?

565
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,960
- Of course, I do.
- What is it?

566
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,730
One more Akdong,
so it's Akhachu.

567
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,850
- You knew?
- Of course.

568
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,650
They'll be performing
together again.

569
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:52,370
The big brothers formed a team -
2,000 won and Andrew Choi.

570
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:55,360
- I can't wait.
- Me, too.

571
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:01,230
First is KPOP STAR's brilliant dark horse,
2,000 won, and sweet voice, Andrew Choi.

572
00:58:01,230 --> 00:58:04,410
Please look forward to it.

573
00:58:04,410 --> 00:58:08,710

[She Was Pretty - JYP]

575
00:59:34,990 --> 00:59:39,680
I got a shock looking at her
She was so pretty

576
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,910
Her deep charm is like espresso
Who wouldn't fall for her?

577
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:48,110
Looking here and there like Dooly
She's perfect wherever she goes

578
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,250
She's like a twinkling star
So she glimmers when she turns

[f(x) Sulli
special guest]

580
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:50,950
She's a cut above from head to toe
So she doesn't care if a man comes near

581
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:54,260
I'm not tired of her
She doesn't get bumped

582
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:58,100
My heart's always aflutter
If I borrow her name for a sec

583
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,090
She's the truth in life

584
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:05,280
KPOP STAR's best stage!

585
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,220
- Wow! That stage was great.
- I enjoyed it. It was good.

586
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:11,780
It was crazy here.
We were dancing.

587
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:14,540
You didn't see me dance?
It was really crazy here.

588
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,070
- Can you show us?
- Alright.

589
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,300
That's good.

590
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,270
Sulli was the "she"
of "She Was Pretty".

591
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,520
Yes it was.

592
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,900
I envy you guys for
performing with her.

593
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,120
- I held you back from going up.
- But she's very attractive.

594
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,190
- You shouldn't do that.
- I'm sorry.

595
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:39,450
The next stage is
even more special.

596
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:44,270
It's Akhachu - Bang Ye-dam
and Akdong Musician.

viewers' votes are 30%.

One team with the lowest total
score will be eliminated...

608

The remaining three will each
get casted to SM, YG, or JYP.

609

to KPOP STAR's semi-finals.

Before you see the results, is there
someone you would like to cast, BoA?

- It's a secret.
- Did that person pass?

It's a secret.

- A secret... okay.
- I don't know either.

- Yes.

envelope and check.

618

They're checking it.

The one who's eliminated
is in the envelope.

620

Looking forward to if the one they
casted passed or was eliminated.

621
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:40,490
Only the three teams that
made it can get casted.

A pity, but the eliminated
cannot get casted.

the end is eliminated today.

JYP! Please begin casting.

628
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:18,070
I felt heavy because talented people
got eliminated starting last week.

629
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:24,780
But it isn't important what
rank you get in this audition.

630
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:27,810
What's important is what
did you learn from it.

631
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:37,920
I want to comfort you with those words
whether you get first or get eliminated.

632
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:45,750
When we start this program, we see you
as a contestant from a judge's view.

633
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:50,560
Towards the end, our views change
as representatives of each agency...

634
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:56,120
And we think as we see you, "What if
they become our agency's artist?"

635
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:59,490
This is when we
think about that.

636
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:04,070
Singing and dancing abilities
are very important, but...

637
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:11,640
The decisive factor for me is
whether you seem natural.

638
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:18,490
- JYP will cast...
- A natural musician...

639
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,940
They sing and do music
naturally as they are.

640
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,750
- Akdong Musician.
- Congratulations!

641

advance to the semi-finals!

01:11:41,710 --> 01:11:45,500
We thought we were going
to get eliminated...

646
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,430
Thank you for saving us.
We will learn a lot.

647
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:53,690
You were worried because the
judges' score wasn't high...

648
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,760
Anyways, you got
good results.

649
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,420
Please move over there, and
why don't we give them a hand?

- I'm curious.
- Really...

655
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:40,090
If I saw all of his skills, I'm
curious what his limits would be.

01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:55,490
- Andrew Choi.
- Congratulations!

659
01:12:55,490 --> 01:13:01,940
He got casted to SM and
advances to the semi-finals.

660
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,640
You got casted to SM.
How do you feel?

661
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,150
I feel great.
Thank you.

662
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:12,990
Thank you.

663
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,220
Please move over there.

664
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:21,620
SM casted Andrew Choi. We're
curious how far he'll go.

665
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:27,800
Only two teams
remain on stage.

666
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:38,940
One of them will leave KPOP STAR
and one of them will get casted.

667
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:45,830
As of now, Andrew Choi got casted
to SM and Akdong Musician to JYP.

668
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:50,230
Ye-dam, how do
you feel?

669
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:55,350
I'm trembling and I wasn't
satisfied with this stage.

670
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:57,330
- Worried?
- Nervous and trembling.

671
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:02,970
Nervous? He's known for not trembling,
but how can he not at this moment?

672
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:05,260
2,000 won, how
do you feel?

673
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:11,480
We're very nervous, but we'll
humbly accept our result.

674
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:19,500
Alright. One seat remains and
the final decision goes to YG.

675
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:23,070
Please begin.

676
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:26,460
[Who's the last semi-finalist
and who is eliminated?]

677
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:32,150
This must have been expected. 2,000
won got the lowest score from JYP...

678
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:38,570
Bang Ye-dam got the lowest score
from me. Only they remained.

679
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:41,370
We have a tremendous
responsibility.

680
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:51,180
When they reach the TOP10, rather
than congratulating the winner...

681
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:55,900
We feel sad in sending away
those that got eliminated.

682
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:07,560
There's something global star PSY said
that made a deep impression on me.

683
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:14,630
He said, "I was never the best, but
I never stopped giving my best."

684
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:18,420
Although younger than me, I
thought he's a great talker.

685
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:29,770
Bang Ye-dam and 2,000 won.
I have mixed feelings.

686
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:37,520
Whether you pass or get eliminated,
everyone here did their best.

687
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,740
The last finalist
casted by YG is...

688
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:46,120
This is the last finalist.

689
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:52,410
I can't believe they're here, and they
especially battled each other the most.

690
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:59,540
Who is the last
to get casted?

691
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,800
The fans' cheers are
growing louder.

692
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,030
- I'll announce it.
- Please do so.

693
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:11,060
- Bang Ye-dam.
- Congratulations!

694
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:19,590
He became a semi-finalist
and got casted to YG.

695
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:28,460
2,000 won put on a great stage,
but now they will say goodbye.

696
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:35,250
They really did well. They showed
us how they tried and improved.

697
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:43,590
Although criticized, they were positive
on stage and truly did their best.

698
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:51,200
They said they would humbly accept it,
but any last words to your fans?

699
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:59,810
We finally get to have this interview
we prepared for since the TOP10.

700
01:16:59,810 --> 01:17:06,570
The judges did that because there's a saying,
"A child you care for gets an extra lash."

701
01:17:06,570 --> 01:17:10,910
We'll be a team that will always
challenge with a humble heart.

702
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:20,050
We got close to our fans, staff,
writers, producers, and directors.

703
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:25,230
We feel sad to leave, and I thank
my family for supporting me.

704
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:33,720
I want to say thanks to Hyo-bin
for bringing me on this program.

705
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:34,850
Thanks man.

706
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,950
A word, Hyo-bin?

707
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:47,150
We always took the challenge
thinking it was our last.

708
01:17:47,150 --> 01:17:49,330
It was a great
honor for us.

709
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:52,180
We thank everyone
that cheered us on.

710
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,300
We'll show you how well
we're doing. Thank you!

711
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,860
A hand for 2,000 won for
showing a great stage!

712
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:02,060
2,000 won unfortunately
got eliminated.

713
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:07,480
Next week will be an
even fiercer semi-final.

714
01:18:07,480 --> 01:18:09,390
See you next week!
Goodbye!

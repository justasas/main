You are watching the 6 teams that
made it after the fierce competition.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,310
Their performances last week were
unexpected with twists after twists.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,960
We look forward to their
performances today.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:10,290
Many came with banners and wearing
same colors to cheer the 6 teams here.

41
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,700
We are proud of the TOP6 that
they have so many fans.

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:25,100
Other than the battles, the TOP6 prepared
a special stage. Look forward to that.

[JYP, YG, You Hee-yeol]

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,260
I have to ask them again.

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,630
You Hee-yeol? We did our first
live show together. How was it?

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,120
I'm getting more nervous because
KPOP STAR is being televised...

51
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,350
But putting that aside, this concerns
the future of the contestants.

52
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,780
So I feel more responsible.

53
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,400
It will be tense because we're
helping them to start off.

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,250
That's right. We're proud how they
act like pros, albeit nervous.

55
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,350
But they could get nervous since
the stage is bigger with more people.

56
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,040
Does JYP have any tips
for such a situation?

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,920
Well... I can't give such tips
because they will be nervous.

58
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,110
It's important to do well and
have fun although nervous.

59
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,030
We look forward to a
great performance.

60
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,600
They should remain composed
even though they are nervous.

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:57,900
YG? This season begins the 3 agencies week
and this week was YG week. What happened?

62
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,870
Our relationship with the finalists
were professional until now.

63
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:07,570
During YG week, I met with the
finalists and had a meal together...

64
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:13,950
I asked if they have any difficulties
so it was more like a personal meeting.

65
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:19,350
2 teams will be eliminated
in this TOP6 battle.

66
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,220
They must have been nervous last week
since it was their first live show.

67
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:29,060
I think there will be great performances
today because they will be less nervous.

68
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:41,030
Alright. There is an agency they
are and are not thinking of...

69
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,770
Aren't you curious which
agency they're thinking of?

70
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,760

so we will watch that right now.

I wanted to meet with them and
figure out their disposition.

81

I wanted to find out if the ones
I have in mind wants to come to YGE.

82
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,720
It was like going on a
blind date during college.

83
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,950
Didn't you write which agency you would
like to go to when you first applied?

84

[No way]

pick the same one.

Since this week is YG week...

177
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:42,540
I'm providing the TOP6 with
all of YGE's resources.

178
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:50,880
They'll hear my advice and meet
2NE1, current senior artists.

179
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,930
I believe there is advice
that artists can give them.

180
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:02,210
It is my wish as an adviser that they
present their best performance this week.

181
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:15,240
We just confirmed what they
thought five months ago.

182
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,920
We don't know if it changed since
five months passed. We'll find out later.

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,060
I'll explain today's rules.

184
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,130
Today is different from
last week's 1:1 battle.

185
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,220
It will be an absolute evaluation.

186
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:43,080
Judges' score 60% and viewers' vote 40%
will be calculated for the total score.

187
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,100
The 4 teams with the highest total score
will advance to the TOP4 live show.

188
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,350
The remaining 2 teams will depart from
KPOP STAR when it's over today.

189
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,080
I'll announce the finalists'
number and their order.

190
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:08,030
No. 1 is Almeng. We always look forward
to what performance they'll show us.

191
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:16,240
No. 2 is Bernard Park. He has a touching
voice that sways women's hearts.

192
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:26,430
No. 3 is the Shorties. These three
girls sing a heavenly harmony.

193
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:34,630
No. 4 is Sam Kim. He is a guitarist
endowed with both talent and soul.

194
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:41,950
No. 5 is Heejun Han. He attempts
at transforming in every round.

195
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,150
No. 6 is Kwon Jina. She has a
thousand faces and various charms.

196
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,920
These 6 teams will be
evaluated by all of you.

197
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,870
It's not an exaggeration to call this
the finals since they're likely winners.

198
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:12,000
Since your votes are 40% of the score,
your votes are very important.

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,910
Yoo Hye-young will explain
how the voting is done.

200
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,080
Yoo Hye-young?

201
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm here with the audience.

202
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,740
Hi, I'm Yoo Hye-young,
KPOP STAR's cheerleader.

203
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,070
It didn't start yet but
things have sure heated up.

204
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:35,300
You can cheer them here or at your
home in front of the TV by voting.

205
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,440
I'll explain how you can vote.

206
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:48,310
Text the contestant's name in Korean or
their number to #0606 on your phone.

207
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,380
Please keep in mind that you can
vote for more than one contestant.

208
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,010
But you cannot make multiple
votes for one contestant.

209
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:05,440
Since voting is possible via KakaoTalk,
those abroad can also participate.

210
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:13,090
Sam Kim made it due to your votes.
So we ask you to vote this week.

211
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:18,530
Let's watch the first performance.

212
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,000
It's Almeng, KPOP STAR's sole duo.

213
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,830
Let's give them a hand since they could be
nervous from going first. Voting starts now.

214
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,770
[Text voting begins]

215
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,570
[Text the contestant's name in Korean or
number to #0606 (10 cents data charge)]

216
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,700
[No. 1 Almeng]

217
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,830
[Almeng is at YGE that
they dreamt of]

218
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:55,830
[They express their joy
with their body]

219
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,390
[All I see is YG]

220
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,350
[Can't be happier than this?]

221
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,630
It's the agency we dreamt of.

222
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,820
It's such a big and great agency that
we can't say yes or no in coming.

223
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,220
It was like a dream.

224
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,320
[They're practicing harder]

225
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:30,570
[But someone's here to
watch Almeng practice]

226
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,180
Hello.

227
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,690
- Do you know her name?
- Yes, I do.

228
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,380
- She's C...
- Choi Rin.

229
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,290
She's CL...

230
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,490
[Choi Rin, Lee Chae-rin]
Since we're both CL...

231
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,060
Please be good to me.

232
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,100
Curious about something?

233
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:11,790
Rapping... isn't something
I have been doing.

234
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,950
Why am I so nervous?

235
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:19,400
I started rapping here and
I was told I was good at it.

236
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:27,610
I didn't rap when I first came to YGE.
I didn't get in here for rapping.

237
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,360
There must be a reason
if YG told you to rap.

238
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,640
So have confidence.

239
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,820
[Even a hug of support]

240
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,870
- Do your best.
- Thank you.

241
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,130
[Almeng received energy from CL]

242
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,920
[What is Almeng singing?]

243
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,950
It's a song from a YG artist.

244
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,810
It's PSY's "Blue Frog."

245
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,420
The lyrics of this song mean
"We'll do what we want."

246
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,970
It has a message that
suits Almeng.

247
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:26,230
I don't think it's just going to be fun,
but they'll also make it serious.

248
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:32,570
The first time I acted like a little devil is
when I told my parents I'm doing music.

249
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:38,150
Even though I'm a big fish in a small pond,
I'm going to do it because it makes me happy.

250
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:46,290
Certain melodies will sound familiar
when you listen to the song.

251
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,290
One of Lady Gaga's song is
"Born This Way."

252
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,330
If you translate that song, it goes
exquisitely well with "Blue Frog."

253
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,950
The word "blue frog" could seem playful
but it contains a heartfelt message.

254
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:12,090
This is PSY's "Blue Frog" but
we want to make it our "Blue Frog."

255
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,290
[No. 1 Almeng]

256
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,440
[Blue Frog - PSY]

257
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,440
I couldn't listen to others
Ever since I was young

258
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,130
Maybe because I was young
But I still don't listen

259
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:53,970
I have my own center so
People try to lift me but can't

260
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:00,870
What I heard the most is
What do you think you'll be?

261
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:08,160
What I wanted to say the most is
I'll do it the way I want

262
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,470
I'm a blue frog
I am me no matter what they say

263
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:22,850
I'm happy as a big fish in a small pond
That is who I am

264
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:28,800
That is who I am

265
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,400
Ribbit ribbit goes the frog
It croaks very loudly

266
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,280
Two blue frogs are singing
It's breathtaking

267
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,250
I'm a big fish in a small pond but
Made it here cuz I didn't hesitate

268
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,530
Do you see the size of my pond?

269
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,930
Even in the stormy weather
I push them back to you

270
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:50,690
No matter how many times I fall
You'll get used to me getting back up

271
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:56,110
Get up, don't cry, sing
When I do cry out loud

272
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,240
It's a symphony of fate that
Resounds in the pond

273
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm a blue frog
I am me no matter what they say

274
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,830
I'm happy as a big fish in a small pond
That is who I am

275
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:57,830
I'm a blue frog
I am me no matter what they say

276
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:05,540
I'm happy as a big fish in a small pond
That is who I am

277
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,460
Just wait and see who succeeds
You'll be ashamed and jealous

278
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,190
You'll start to like me
Blue frog

279
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,350
This stage was by No. 1 Almeng with
their uniquely exciting performance!

280
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,520
They sang PSY's "Blue Frog."

281
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,750
She dropped her bracelet...
It was a great performance.

282
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:38,570
What did the three judges think?
Let's hear the commentaries and score.

283
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:49,050
Who'll grab the mike first?
Calculating the scores first...

284
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:53,130
- It's You Hee-yeol.
- I enjoyed it.

285
00:24:53,130 --> 00:25:00,670
There's something I felt today.
We always talked about Choi Rin.

286
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:07,030
She has great ideas and is like
a scene stealer but today...

287
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:10,300
I kept on seeing Hae-yong.

288
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,930
Hae-yong also held the balance of
this team and was the mainstay.

289
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:18,760
You have a nice voice.

290
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:26,010
We always complimented Choi Rin but
Hae-yong's voice stood out today.

291
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,680
It went well and you
chose a good song.

292
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:34,310
Antenna Music's score is...

293
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,910
I give you a 90.

294
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,770
Antenna Music gave a 90.

295
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,710
Who'll go next?

296
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,700
Antenna Music gave a 90.
JYP is going next.

297
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:56,570
I look at two things - how good
you are and how new it is.

298
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:04,080
There are so many great singers.
Why do we need Almeng?

299
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,530
We don't need you if there isn't anything new
because we have so many great singers.

300
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:16,340
You two are really good and
Hae-yong especially sang well.

301
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:26,020
The problem is that Hae-yong's
singing wasn't in a new color.

302
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:32,490
You enlarge your voice when you try
to sing the high notes powerfully.

303
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,670
It's a style used by many
established singers.

304
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:42,310
It'll be new if you sing the high notes in
the same voice you use for speaking.

305
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:50,280
No one has your voice but you.
Try to find a way to sing in your voice.

306
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:56,340
On the other hand, Choi Rin sings in
the same voice as if she's speaking.

307
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:03,950
Be more confident and show off
your talents on stage.

308
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,220
That was a bit unfortunate.
JYP's score is...

309
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,820
He spoke of originality
and confidence.

310
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,690
It's 82!

311
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,070
Alright. All that's left is YG.

312
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,790
Judging them is vague because they said
in the clip that they want to go to YGE.

313
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:30,420
The viewers could take it the wrong way
if I give them a high score today.

314
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,120
I believe you'll be
objective and impartial.

315
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,270
I half agree with JYP when
he said they weren't new.

316
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,330
I agree with him on
the singing part.

317
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,420
I think Almeng is new because there is
no mixed duet like them in Korea.

318
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:04,210
Lee Seung-hoon from Season 1 was
also unique and was scouted by YGE.

319
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:10,460
This was sung by PSY and GD
but it didn't remind me of PSY.

320
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,210
As you two said, it was like your
"Blue Frog" so it was good.

321
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,240
YG's score is...

322
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,740
It was a different opinion.

323
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,140
The score...

324
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,350
It's 90!

325
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,110
We heard the judges' score
and commentaries.

326
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:32,900
The judges' total score is 262.

327
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,570
Text voting is still going on.

328
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:43,570
Those cheering for Almeng can
text "1" or "Almeng" to #0606.

329
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,440
Voting can also be
done via KakaoTalk.

330
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,840
This stage was by
No. 1 Almeng!

331
00:28:53,370 --> 00:29:04,440
People I don't even know came
to see me and cheer me on.

332
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:10,220
They even had my name on posters.
I was really happy about it.

333
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,600
What about Bernard Park?

334
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,190
I'm singing Sung Si-kyung's
"You Touched My Heart."

335
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,040
"You Touched My Heart"?

336
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:39,760
Give me a minute to think.

337
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:49,080
I don't think you ever succeeded in
singing gayo all this time, right?

338
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,670
I told you to sing pop since
there isn't much time left.

339
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:59,510
I wanted you to have an advantage but
this is a mountain you must climb.

340
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm more comfortable
singing pop songs.

341
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:15,280
But I need to sing gayo if
I want to live in Korea.

342
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,760
[What do the other judges think?]

343
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,270
Really?

344
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,130
I never expected this.

345
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,530
It's gayo but it'll be good.

346
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,460
It's a melody that he can sing
but the problem is...

347
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,730
It's crucial how much he can feel
and express the Korean lyrics.

348
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,690
I'm trying to use more
Korean to improve.

349
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:16,860
I translated the lyrics into English
to be able to understand.

350
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:25,250
[His efforts to express the
sentiments of the song]

351
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,490
I gave my all thinking
this will be my last.

352
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:41,230
I'll do my best to show
that I can sing gayo.

353
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,690
[No. 2 Bernard Park]

354
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:01,560
[You Touched My Heart - Sung Si-kyung]

355
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,990
[Music director - Kwon Tae-eun
Bandmaster - Seo Young-do]

356
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,250
This stage was by No. 2 Bernard Park
who presented a sweet ballad.

357
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,980
Not only women but he also
melts men's hearts as well.

358
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,540
Let's hear the commentaries and
score on his performance.

359
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:56,810
I tell my artists before recording that
singing is just adding notes to the words.

360
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:03,980
For example, there's a way to say
"Yeah, that's how it was."

361
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:08,910
There are expressions and way of
speaking that only Koreans use.

362
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:14,120
Since you're not good at Korean,
you don't have that way of speaking.

363
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:20,740
You don't know how to move your eyebrows
or breathe when you say such things.

364
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,980
Basically, you're just reading.

365
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:31,180
There's a limit to you in singing gayo
unless you improve in Korean.

366
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:37,650
Despite that fact, I still get the chills
when you sing the high notes.

367
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:46,190
It was unfortunate but just as
what You Hee-yeol said before...

368
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,140
You can't change class.
JYP's score is...

369
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,970
JYP's score...

370
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,940
It's 86!

371
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,400
Alright. Let's hear the next
commentary and score.

372
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,050
It's been a while since
I agreed with JYP.

373
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:08,450
- It's been a long time.
- It sure has.

374
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:17,010
I don't watch dubbed movies. I listen
to it in English and read the subtitles.

375
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:26,150
I don't understand English but what
they are saying conveys the mood.

376
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:32,560
Bernard Park is a gold worth a million
dollars but with a small crack in it.

377
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,730
I was rhyming (gold and crack
sounds the same in Korean).

378
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:42,350
For him to sing gayo with
his pronunciation...

379
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:46,690
He doesn't have any habits for
someone born and raised in the US.

380
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:52,770
I think he'll improve but
it wasn't good enough.

381
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,970
I was a little strict in scoring
since your performance was a pity.

382
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,240
YG's score is...

383
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,330
YG's score...

384
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,530
It's going up...

385
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,760
It's 89!

386
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,080
You Hee-yeol is next.

387
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,590
Today's performance
cleared up one thing for me.

388
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:21,650
YG once compared you to a heavyweight
saying you're heavy without minor skills.

389
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:27,970
But a world champion wins with a
powerful hook and not with jabs.

390
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:32,080
You're born with a great talent.

391
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,270
You sang Michael Buble's "Home"
and said how you missed home.

392
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:42,010
But I don't think it's time
for you to go back home.

393
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,970
I'm curious of his score.

394
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,060

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,940
He talked about a
powerful punch.

397
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,160

We were hurt and sad that Hanna was
eliminated because we were close.

405
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,550

- Why are you running away?

[Someone might think
she's trying to get them]

419
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,900
You're cute because you're short.
So that's why you're the Shorties.

420

- Then...
- We're really short.

00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:57,200
I think this will be their
best performance so far.

I look forward to it and can already
picture their harmony and solo parts.

We're going back to where we
started with this performance.

We want to hear
"The Shorties are back."

443
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,680
This stage was by No. 3 The Shorties.
They are the beautiful divas.

444
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,610
They're getting more beautiful as
they improve in singing every week.

445
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,630
They're really beautiful. I wonder
what their commentaries will be.

446
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,240
JYP?

447
00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:07,660
Another broadcast told me that they
should apply lip balm on the lips.

448
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,620
I see that they were
careful today.

449
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:21,750
I said this because there are those that
listen to advice and those that don't.

450
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:26,470
I feel like being a judge because
The Shorties listen to advice.

451
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,920
I told them not to breathe a certain
way and they stopped doing that.

452
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,310
Ever since The Shorties made it to TOP10,
I asked, "Why force yourself to be loud?"

453
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,820
"Why force yourself to
sound deep and wide?"

454
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:49,170
"You didn't do that in the beginning.
Just sing as if speaking." But today...

455
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:56,090
They sang in the voice they speak in
and were also loud at the same time.

456
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:02,060
It was a proud performance that
we can present anywhere in the world.

457
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,340
I hope Beyonce and Destiny's Child
could listen to this as well.

458
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:11,420
I was proud of this performance
and you did very well.

460
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,910
I'm curious of the score.

461

JYP had his uniquely
satisified look... it's 96!

462
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,510
That's a very high score!
It's the highest so far.

463
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,250
Let's listen to the next one.

464
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:37,550
When you were picking an agency,
you pronounced mine as Athena.

465
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:42,640
You look like Athenians. I think I saw
something similar in the Olympics.

466
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,710
You look like goddesses.

467
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,430
You were like three goddesses
in the world of singers.

468
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,870
It was the best song choice.

469
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:03,130
And I think it was the best out of all
your performances this season.

470
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,760
I'm saying this again but
the Shorties are really good.

471
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,590
Thank you.

what is the score?

It's 95!

475
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,160
They have the highest score.

476
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,390
What will YG give?

477
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:41,660
It was hard for their voices to stand out
in last week's song with a full band.

478
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:47,400
But in this song, they were able to
sing the harmony they're best at...

479
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,670
And they were able to
explode at the high notes.

480
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:58,090
We three judges felt the same.
I felt cold as I was listening.

481
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:04,010
My back felt itchy.
I felt a shudder.

482
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:09,080
But since they chose JYP
five months ago...

483
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,620
I'll be strict in scoring.
YG's score is...

484
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:16,310
We don't know what they're
thinking now. YG's score...

485
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:19,120
It's 96!

486
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,440
They have the highest score at 287!

I once said that I'm
going to be eliminated.

499
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:27,900
But I didn't think how much that
hurt those that cheered me.

500
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,540
That's when I thought
I should try harder.

I'm your fan...

510
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:08,670
Is there an interpreter?

00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,110
[He's surprised and
forgot Korean]

512
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:12,760

[He can't breathe]

514
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:21,480
I was sleepy and tired
before she came in.

515
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:28,190
But she suddenly came in
saying she's cheering me.

516
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:31,530
I've been encouraged...

517
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:34,740
I want to do well.

song choice]

519

[JYP's "You're the One"]

521
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:50,890
What gets me excited
as a composer is...

522
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:56,650
How will he play this on the guitar
with what chords and what strokes?

523
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:58,990
My heart is already pounding.

524
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:03,450
I haven't been playing
the guitar that long.

525
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,240
So I think I showed
everything I could.

526
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:13,290
It's hard because I have to show
something new this time.

527
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:20,360
We'll be able to see his ability
in interpreting gayo.

528
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,150
[Gayo interpretation is crucial!]

529
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,050
I wonder but I also feel uneasy.

530
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:33,650
I made it here with votes
and not my skills.

531
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,890
Now I have this desire.

532
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:43,080
Even though I'm eliminated, I want to
give my best performance at least once.

533
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,170

[You're the One - JYP]

536
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,810
This stage was by
No. 4 Sam Kim!

537
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:14,260
He must be feeling good doing ad-libs
and gestures he never did before.

538
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,290
Let's wait since it'll take some
time for him to come down.

539
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:24,250
He should be coming down a wire.
A great performance from a high stage.

540
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:29,340
Let's hear the commentaries
as he makes his way down.

541
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:43,050
Singing, skills, and theory can be
taught and efforts can be made.

542
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:48,940
But soul can't be taught.

543
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,540
Sam's a soul man.

544
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:03,550
The stage was covered in soul that
I didn't hear his singing or anything else.

545
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:12,190
The amazing thing is that Sam used
to lose breath at the end like this.

546
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:17,050
And he strained his throat
when singing the high notes.

547
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,680
I don't know why those two
things suddenly disappeared.

548
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,180
It's completely gone.

549
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:29,230
But I can't give you 100 because
you still breathe with your chest.

550
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:36,030
That's a pity but let's work
on that during JYP week.

551
00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:37,610
JYP's score is...

552
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:41,740
He has soul but breathes with
his chest. What's his score?

553
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,580
It's 97!

554
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:46,000
- It's the highest ever!
- Thank you.

555
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,650
Is JYP now a Samaholic
and not a Beraholic?

556
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:52,500
Let's hear the next one.

557
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,990
It's not that Sam can't sing.

558
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:07,050
It could be impossible to sing well
to play such groove and sing.

559
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:12,200
I wasn't listening but dancing.

560
00:58:13,540 --> 00:58:18,950
That is music's spell.

561
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:27,890
It's a great ability that a 16-year-old
can make us dance with just a guitar.

562

Today was the best out of
all your performances.

Among the TOP6, when looking
just at their musical level...

568
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,920
I dare say Sam Kim is at the top
even though he's the youngest.

569
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,370
The chords, playing solo, sense
of rhythm, and everything else.

570
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:06,340
KPOP STAR is exciting because
we see the beauty of a gemstone.

571
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,180
We're seeing him sprout.

572
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:15,570
Compared to a gemstone, Sam Kim is
a diamond hidden in the ground.

This stage was by

580
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:56,650
Is it because Sam got energy from Dara?

friends he became close with]

01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:47,530
All my friends were non-Koreans.

01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:54,410
I've never interacted closely with Koreans
or even shared from the same bowl.

591
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:57,510
I've never even laughed
out loud together.

592
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:00,190
It might not seem like much
but it does build up.

593
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:06,520
Maybe because I never experienced it,
I didn't know it would build up like this.

594
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:12,010
I've trained together and was eliminated
in American Idol so I know the feeling.

595
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:19,150
Since they're Korean like me,
they're like my brothers.

596
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,350
And I know what they like since
we spend time together.

farewells in auditions]

[But never this warm feeling]

599
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,950
I knew about this and applied
but it's different here.

600
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:49,050
The difference is that it feels like
I'm pushing my brother with my hands.

601
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:52,880
[With such mixed feelings,
he's in another survival]

605
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,270
I was very sensitive in
my choice this time.

606
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:13,650
I sang many Korean songs
from each generation.

607
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:17,530
But you never heard and
don't know gayo.

608
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:20,450
Actually I didn't have any
knowledge on gayo.

609
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:26,630
Gayo was hard for me since
I immigrated when I was 12.

610
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,780
The reason I keep attempting gayo...

611
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:35,070
And came on KPOP STAR is to be
loved by the Korean people.

612
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:40,380
If I'm loved for this attempt
and if it's because of gayo...

613
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,610
It'll be worth it.

614

Every round is like a war for him.
You can tell just by the song choices.

617
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:09,740
The title of being TOP6 or TOP4
doesn't matter anymore to me.

618
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:17,590
To put on a great stage and challenge
myself every round in my motherland...

619
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,260

He started off with James Morrison's
"You Give Me Something" in Round 1.

627

Then it was Kim Jo-han, Kim Bum-soo,
Kim Tae-woo, JYP, Kim Bum-soo, Regret...

628
01:08:04,510 --> 01:08:09,350
Every song he sang was gayo.

629
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:13,230
Heejun's speciality is pop.

630
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,310
He knows that and doesn't sing it.

631
01:08:17,030 --> 01:08:19,190
I understand that.

632
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:28,080
You will be a singer loved by the
Korean people so don't worry.

He's born again to KPOP STAR
from American Idol.

I'll be saying something different
from You Hee-yeol for the first time.

639
01:08:52,690 --> 01:08:57,340
The Shorties and Sam Kim
performed before you.

640
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,930
I felt something when
I watched their performance.

641
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:04,760
Is there a female trio like them?
Is there any current female trio?

642
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,820
Is there any other singer who
could sing "Listen" like them?

643
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:14,090
Even Sam, is there anyone in Korea
with such skills at that age?

644
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,940
I gave them a generous score
because of such thoughts.

645
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,280
Heejun sings very well
because of experience.

646
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:26,450
But while listening, I wonder how
Lee Seung-hwan would sing this.

647
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:32,230
How would Sung Si-kyung sing this?
I can't help but compare him.

648
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:37,550
I had this question if Heejun
sang this better or not.

649
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:41,020
Remember when I asked
Who are you?

650
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:44,820
Rather than advancing or
becoming the winner...

651
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:48,760
If you want to be at the top,
like I always told you...

652
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:52,550
You need your own
powerful weapon.

653

It's 85!

656
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,950
Next is JYP.

657
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:11,430
You went all out in singing
"I'm free" in the middle.

658
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:13,700
But you didn't look free.

659
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:27,020
You don't look free whether you sing
pop or ballad, talk, laugh, or cry.

660
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:33,410
You're being cautious.
You think and worry.

What can make you relaxed?

662
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:48,450
When YG asked who you are last time,
that question is still hanging over me.

663
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:53,290
This isn't a problem
regarding your singing.

664
01:10:53,290 --> 01:11:02,670
The powerful weapon YG talked about
is you, Heejun. But who are you?

665
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:07,270
What is your voice? Your singing style?
What is your expression when you speak?

666
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:11,700
Are you bright and frivolous
or cautious? I'm not sure.

667
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:16,690
That is what I think, but
I was just speaking my mind.

668
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:19,130
That was a pity.
My score is...

669
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:23,230
JYP's score...

670
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:24,890
It's 84!

671
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,190
His score is 259.

674

This stage was by
No. 5 Heejun Han!

675
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:52,790
- I'm curious of Kwon Jina's choice.
- It's 2NE1's "I Don't Care."

676
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,690
"I Don't Care"?

677
01:11:56,930 --> 01:12:02,840
I don't know if it'll be a tasty
song if it's mixed with you.

678
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:06,840
What I want to hear from you,
everything was good until now...

679
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,690
But you need something new.

680
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:17,290
Since you've been singing gayo,
I think pop isn't a bad idea.

681
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:22,170
I also agree with him that
I need something new.

682
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:25,850
But I'm worried if
I can do well.

683
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:29,480

after thinking it over!]

684

song choice]

685
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,610
Does she know this song?

686
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,930
She's finally going head on.

[Sting's "Fields of Gold" released in
1992 even before she was born]

688
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,660
[Remakes by many female musicians
including Eva Cassidy are well-known]

689
01:12:54,610 --> 01:13:00,760
Her arrangements for gayo
had the four steps.

690
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:05,160
But this song doesn't have that.

691
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,440
It just flows.

692
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,290
I'm not sure if she can
make this song her own.

693
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,890
This is my first attempt in pop.

694
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:24,290
I'm at a loss since I need to prepare
many things with less than a week left.

695
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:30,850

practicing but her worries linger]

Call me if you need help.

702
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:03,440
I'll give you lessons.

703

Any hardships while
doing the live show?

706
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:21,910
I had many compliments so...

707
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:25,560
- You're burdened?
- Yes, I am.

708
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,310
It's all in how you look at it.

709
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:33,980
Instead of thinking, "I'm going to do well"
or "I'm going to do it no matter what"...

710
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:39,800
If you just enjoy it
and have fun...

711
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:46,200
You'll get better results than when
you thought, "I should do well."

712
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:49,930
Have peace of mind and enjoy.

713
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:51,840
Thank you.

714

[She blew her worries away
with support from Minzy!]

716
01:14:57,450 --> 01:15:00,510
I look forward to it
the most because...

717
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:06,330
It'll be very different from what
she had shown until now.

718
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:11,990
I'm a bit worried because it's going
to be different from what I've shown.

719
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:17,100
I think it will be a
moving performance.

720
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:25,280
[No. 6 Kwon Jina]

721
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,700
This stage was by
No. 6 Kwon Jina.

722
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:59,430
What did the judges think of
Kwon Jina's performance?

723
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:04,930
I don't need to listen to JYP.
I can tell just by his looks.

724
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:08,450
But let's hear him first to
see if my hunch is correct.

725
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:16,370
If there's a great singing instructor
whether it's in the US or England...

726
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:21,120
I sign up several months in advance
and get lessons. I still do that.

727
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,460
All those great instructors have
different teaching methods.

728
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:30,550
But the one common thing is...

729
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:34,370
We are told to relax when singing,
especially the high notes.

730
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,930
Every instructor says
that same thing.

731
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:44,240
Not a single one of Kwon Jina's muscles
are stiff when singing the high notes.

732
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,230
Thus you sing with such skill.

733
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:53,320
This song is hard.
Sting's songs are hard.

734
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:58,670
It starts in minor and ends in major.
The eight measures go on like that.

735
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:05,610
So the song has this strange mood,
but you even do that perfectly.

736
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:10,750
I listened as a fan
this time around.

737
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,070
JYP's score is...

738
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:17,200
What's JYP's score?
He said he's her fan.

739
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:19,660
It's 96!

740
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,430
Next is YG.

741
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:31,720
Even though this is a live show,
I'm going to be honest in judging.

742
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:35,230
As a fan of Kwon Jina...

743
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:38,920
Today's performance wasn't
that impressive for me.

744
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:45,120
It's because this is your first attempt in
pop and it must've been a difficult task.

745
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:54,820
Since you sang gayo well, I thought
maybe you only did what you're good at.

746
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:59,680
When you sang Sting's song, I was thinking,
"Let's see how she sings this one."

747
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:10,350
Her voice reminded me of Adele or Laura
even though the voice is different.

748
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:16,450
Her strength is taking any genre
and making it her own.

749
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:20,040
Today's pop was less impressive
than the gayo last week...

750
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,380
But I'll give a generous score
since this was your first attempt.

751
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,340
YG's score is...

752
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:28,380
It was a different commentary
but what is YG's score?

753
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,090
It's going up.

754
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,960
It's 90!

755
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,440
Next is Antenna Music's
You Hee-yeol.

756
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,020
No matter which singer sings
Sting's "Fields of Gold"...

757
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:49,960
The song itself wasn't made
to captivate us.

758
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:58,100
Let's say we were to listen to this at
home at night and not at an audition.

759
01:21:58,100 --> 01:22:01,500
It'll make our hearts sink.

760
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:08,600
Kwon Jina is very good at
interpreting this song.

761
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,860
She's good with songs that have groove
but this song's melody is monotonous.

762
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:18,500
Yet she captivates us with
her voice with just a guitar.

763
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,580
I want to believe in
that power of music.

764
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,160
Antenna Music's score is...

765
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:26,730
She makes people's heart sink
but what is her score?

766
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,050
It's 96!

767
01:22:29,050 --> 01:22:31,950

I held back the score for this
person. The second finalist is...

825
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:20,630
- Who is it?
- Kwon Jina.

826
01:32:20,630 --> 01:32:23,390
It's Kwon Jina!

827
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:29,660
She's the second to advance
to next week's TOP4 stage.

828
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:35,150
Congratulations Kwon Jina.
Please move to the winners seat.

829
01:32:35,150 --> 01:32:38,860
Now only two teams remain.

830
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:45,650
Only two from the four. Half will
pass and half will be eliminated.

831
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:49,230
You Hee-yeol will
announce the third.

832
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,910
Before I open it, I thought
about this at home.

833
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:56,420
I can't imagine who among
the TOP6 will be eliminated.

834
01:32:56,420 --> 01:32:59,070
Can you make a guess now?

835
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:08,780
Even pro musicians can't satisfy viewers
every week by arranging a new song.

836
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:12,100
I applaud them for
overcoming such hardships.

837
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:16,180
Let's give them a round of applause.
You are already future K-pop stars.

838
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:23,480
But half will remain and half will depart.
You Hee-yeol, please make the announcement.

839
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:30,400
He seems a little surprised.

840
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,330
Who is it, You Hee-yeol?

841
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:37,990
The TOP4 finalist is...

842
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,760
Before I announce it, I want to
say that all of you did well.

843
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:48,350
- The TOP4 finalist is...
- The third finalist is...

844
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:50,750
- The Shorties.
- The Shorties!

845
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:54,230
They received a lot of
compliments today.

846
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:03,660
The Shorties are the third to advance.
Please move to the winners seat.

847
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:09,970
There wasn't much difference
in how the viewers thought.

848
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:20,310
Now only one seat remains for
next week's TOP4 live stage.

849
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:23,190
From among Heejun Han,
Bernard Park, and Almeng...

850
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:27,820
Only one will advance to
next week's live show.

851
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:32,040
The remaining two will
unfortunately depart.

852
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:34,440
I don't know what you think.

853
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:38,090
The last envelope is
in my hand.

854
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:41,110
Even the judges don't know.

855
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:47,390
The total score from judges' score 60%
and real-time viewers' vote 40%...

856
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:52,810
I will announce the
last TOP4 finalist.

857
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:55,030
Who do you think it is?

858
01:34:58,890 --> 01:35:02,110
All of you are cheering but
I didn't understand a single word.

859
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:05,220
I will now open it.

860
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:22,620
The result is out.

861
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:34,180
The last one from among the three that
will advance to next week's live show is...

862
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:42,720
Please congratulate this person
for all those hardships.

863
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,870
Please congratulate this
person with a warm applause.

864
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:50,270
The last TOP4 finalist is...

865
01:35:50,270 --> 01:35:51,670
Bernard Park!

866
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:57,480
Congratulations!

867
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:04,650
He remained steadfast and
attempted a Korean gayo.

868
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:09,750
He must have not understood
the lyrics but tried to do so.

869
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:15,320
In the end, he dramatically
advanced to TOP4.

870
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,250
Please gather everyone.

871
01:36:18,030 --> 01:36:26,890
Kwon Jina and the Shorties are
encouraging the eliminated with tears.

872
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:32,650
Would one of the judges say
something for the eliminated?

873
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:33,930
JYP?

874
01:36:37,690 --> 01:36:46,470
The judges and viewers won't remember
what place you got in a few years.

875
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:52,960
What's important is the song and
performance you're giving.

876
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,460
No one will remember what
place you got in a few years.

877
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:59,870
Try harder with what
you learned here.

878
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:03,290
Go Heejun and Almeng!
Do your best.

879
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:04,440
Thank you.

880
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:08,220
Almeng and Heejun Han were
shockingly eliminated.

881
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:11,180
Tune in to next week's live show.

882
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:16,840
Look forward to what changes there
will be since next is JYP week.

883
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:21,420
This was KPOP STAR Season 3, a real
audition where dreams turn into reality.

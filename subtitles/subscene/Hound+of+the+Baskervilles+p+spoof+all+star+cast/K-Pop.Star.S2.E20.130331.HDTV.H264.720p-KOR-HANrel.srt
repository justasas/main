We didn't plan on picking
them for Season 2's TOP3.

12
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,290
But each is different
with their own colors.

Will the winner be
the oldest ever?

I believe Bang Ye-dam's
future is most exceptional.

a new page in auditioning history.

Lately, I think
he's like a bull.

is slowly approaching.

- I caught a bad cold...
- A hand... she caught a cold.

55
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,930
Did you expect them to
make it to the semifinals?

56

I never expected them.
Just seeing them...

57

best to perform at your optimal level.

get well from your cold.

the commentaries last week.

let's not fight.

say to them before they begin?

First, congratulations.

70
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,650
It's a tremendous thing to
have made it to the TOP3.

71
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,050
Only one of you will be
3rd, 2nd, or the winner.

72
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,260
But in five years, we won't be sure
who was the winner or who was 2nd.

73
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,990
People won't remember your rank. It's
the stage and song they'll remember.

the winner or runner-up.

BIGBANG's Taeyang.

170
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,350
Next is Andrew Choi
and SHINee.

171
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,040
It will be meaningful.

172
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:05,390
And JYP mobilized 2AM, Wonder Girls,
and miss A for Akdong Musician.

173
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,810
Looking forward to it.

174
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:15,040
Before we begin, I will
announce the TOP3's number.

175
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,950
Can't believe he's 12. With nerves
of steel, he's No. 1 Bang Ye-dam!

176
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:32,870
He became a likely winner with
his potential. No. 2 Andrew Choi!

177
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:39,300
A shock to the gayo world. It's teenage
singer-songwriter, No. 3 Akdong Musician!

178
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:50,300
You can choose who will
advance to the finals.

179
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,950
Boom will give you the
details on the voting.

180
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,310
Hi, I'm KPOP STAR's MC,
Boom. Glad to be here.

181
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,790
KPOP STAR's semfinal is the
final gateway to victory.

182
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,730
It will soon be broadcasted
here at Bucheon Gymnasium.

183
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:20,110
We earnestly want
your votes today.

184
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:23,680
I'll tell you
how to vote.

185
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,840
Open up the messaging
on your cellphone...

186
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:36,890
Text #0606 with the finalists'
Korean name or number.

187
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,090
You're rooting for more than
one person? No need to worry.

188
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,760
You can vote for
more than one person.

189
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,240
But you can't make multiple
votes for the same person.

190
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,250
Even one vote counts.

191
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,400
You can also vote via
mobile messengers.

192
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,610
Who do you think will be
Season 2's winner?

193
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,040
Bang Ye-dam, Andrew Choi,
or Akdong Musician?

194
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,000
We'll have those
results today.

195
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,170
Please vote.

196
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:15,390
We now begin voting
for the semifinals!

197
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,790
[Voting Begins]

198
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,450
[Text #0606 with their
name or number]

199
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:39,460
Judges' score is 70% and votes are 30%.
The total determines who advances.

200
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:46,170
The one with the lowest score will be
eliminated and the rest advances.

201
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,380
Who will advance to
KPOP STAR's finals?

202
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:57,630
The semifinal prepared by SM,
YG, and JYP will soon begin.

203
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,980
People have expectations as he
was casted to YG for the first time.

204
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,450
We will start off
with Bang Ye-dam!

205
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,140
It'll be the most
tense stage.

206
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,790
How will he release his potential
again with training from YG?

207
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,860
That's why it's hard.

208
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,980
You have to draw something out
that you never showed before.

209
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,490
He can't do it today since he's
emotional because of 2,000 won.

210
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,340
Get some sleep and we'll
discuss tomorrow.

211
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,640
[Next morning]

212
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,500
[Turns over a new leaf!
First day at YG]

213
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,640
I want to get
there quickly.

214
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,760
[Has high hopes since
it's his first time at YG]

215
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,320
[But]

216
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,170
[Stops at a new place]

217
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,490
- Get off, Ye-dam.
- Here?

218
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,190
[Where is this?]

219
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,930
[He enters a big gym and
not YG Entertainment]

220
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:14,840
[A shiny vehicle
approaches him]

221
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,710
[The one riding it is...]

222
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,200
[Ye-dam's idol - G-Dragon]

223
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,810
I was surprised.

224
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,010
I really liked GD...

225
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,260
I mean, I really
like him!

226
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,930
I thought, "What would
give Ye-dam strength?"

227
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:43,200
I thought his role model is G-Dragon,
who came to YG at the age of 13.

228
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,080
[G-Dragon approaches
Ye-dam during his break]

229
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Wait, wait!

230
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,250
- Hi.
- Hello.

231
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,870
[GD puts out his
hand first]

232
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,690
[When GD looks at him]

233
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,260
[He's frozen]

234
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,420
It's good to see you in
person and not only on TV.

235
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,910
You wrote your own
rap lyrics, right?

236
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,440
You wrote about BoA.

237
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,030
[GD remembers his stage!]

238
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,360
Want to stand there?

239
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
[Ye-dam standing on
a world tour stage?]

240
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,730
[A real K-pop star's stage
and not an audition stage!]

241
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,960
This is the center.

242
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,880
[He's speechless]

243
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,630
I wanted to become a great singer
later and stand on that stage.

244
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,330
It was awesome.

245
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,280
[A high five wishing him
to advance to the finals]

246
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,270
I'm giving you energy.

247
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,840
[Signs it and writes
a message for him]

248
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,630
"Come to me after you
become a great singer."

249
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,120
[Receiving GD's energy, his steps
are light as he arrives at YG]

250
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,870
[Begins choosing a song]

251
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:57,870
One of the shocks I received this season
is when Ye-dam sang Bieber's "Baby".

252
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,720
"Huh? He's better at
rapping than singing."

253
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,090
It's due to his exceptional
sense of rhythm.

254
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,770
His rapping was good and I
wanted to show that again.

255
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:14,240
So I chose The Black Eyed Peas'
"Where Is the Love" for him.

256
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,720
When I used to rap, it was
just a little in the middle.

257
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,900
Since this is a hip-hop song,
I have to rap correctly.

258
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,330
He raps better than me.

259
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,210
Thank you.

260
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,480
I think Tablo should
look over the lyrics.

261
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,420
The results of those that came
to YG weren't that great.

262
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,950
I have to turn that around at
least once before the show's over.

263
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,310
[Victory]

264
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,400
I could speak of this
in my heart, but...

265
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,670
I didn't know how to
express this in rap.

266
00:19:55,670 --> 00:20:00,230
Tablo helped me how to
express that and rhyme.

267
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,560
"I'm not used to this
situation. I'm wandering."

268
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,980
[Unexpectedly, his
diary is serious]

269
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm in a surival audition.

270
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:15,400
I felt sad and lonely as
they left one by one.

271
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,430
But I find hope since
I have music.

272
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:31,350
People might think he's simple because
he's 12, but he's not. He has depth.

273
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm envious of him.

274
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,740
Because of him,
3 YG studios...

275
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,890
No artist at YG
does that.

276
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,650
Many people at YG are helping me.
So I think I have to try harder.

277
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,650
Please look forward
to it. Yeah!

278
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,290
[Where Is the Love - The Black Eyed Peas
(arr. by Tablo, PK, Lydia Paek)]

279
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,710
It made me dream
It made Michael Jackson sad

280
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm afraid of the adults' world
My shoulders are small but feels heavy

281
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,770
Ye-dam has no brothers or sisters
But those that are like brothers or sisters

282
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,490
Leave and that makes me shed tears
I feel lonely to return to an empty room

283
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,320
Even though I am lacking
Music filled me with joy

284
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,180
I love you. Watch me
Thank you so much

285
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,790
We could feel his thoughts in the rap
lyrics and arrangement. It was impressive.

286
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,630
We're curious of his
score and commentary.

287
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,770
I enjoyed it.

288
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:58,530
You said you wanted to turn
the tables and hit a homer.

289
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:05,110
It was the best stage that
YG could come up with.

290
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,860
It was a great stage that was
in YG and Ye-dam's style.

291
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:19,100
I thought if there's a show like this where
contestants change during the show.

292
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,490
If you compare his first stage
and this stage side by side...

293
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,020
His voice was barely audible
before and wasn't confident.

294
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,440
Now he has charisma, swag,
vocalization, and breathing.

295
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,010
It was a great stage.

296
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:38,710
One thing was
unfortunate.

297
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:46,650
A few weeks ago, your father said,
"Be careful not to go too fast."

298
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:51,200
I think you were excited - you
liked the song and everything.

299
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,310
Your beat and dance got fast.
That was it. I enjoyed it.

300
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,010
- JYP's score is...
- Thank you very much.

301
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,020
That's a lot of compliments.
But the score is...

302
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,390
- It's 92!
- Thank you.

303
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:04,590
It's a good score.

304
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,800
- BoA?
- Yes.

305
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,430
This is Ye-dam's first time at
YG and we saw their combination.

306
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:22,820
I think this hip-hop
style really fits him.

307
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,770
It finished like a club which is YG's
stlye. The exciting stage was great.

308
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:39,570
I still think you need more work on your
pronunciation - English and Korean.

309
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,230
Pronunciation is important
especially in rapping.

310
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,720
You need to make
efforts for that.

311
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,160
SM's score is...

312
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,870
She talked about pronunciation,
but what is SM's score?

313
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,280
- It's 89!
- Thank you.

314
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,070
Last is YG's score
and commentary.

315
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:16,100
This song isn't really great in showing
off one's singing skills or dance.

316
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:21,390
Even The Black Eyed Peas don't do
much at their concert with this song.

317
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,660
You can't dance or show
off your singing skills.

318
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:29,460
I thought of how to interpret
this song for Bang Ye-dam.

319
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,400
Since he showed many things,
I don't know if you felt it, but...

320
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:43,070
I refrained him from dancing since
the viewers said they can't hear him.

321
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:46,490
As he refrained from dancing and
focused more on rapping and singing...

322
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,630
For me, the motions
were a little wanting.

323
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,020
I think it's hard even for me to
arrange and do this in a week.

324
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,560
I want to give you a
high score for that.

325
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,600
- YG's score is...
- It's YG's score.

326
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,560
He did the producing.
The score is...

327
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,880
- It's 90!
- Thank you.

328
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,360
The judges' score is 271.

329
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,310
As YG said, it's not easy for someone
so young to do this in a week.

330
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:23,170
What was the hardest
during that week?

331
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:26,140
A week is short.

332
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:33,340
Singing, dancing, rapping were hard
because I had to rush things.

333
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,340
It was hard, huh? He's also at the
age where he needs plenty of sleep.

334
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,830
He didn't get much sleep.
I heard you were sleepy.

335
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,570
- Uh... yes.
- Good job.

336
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:47,220
Good job. A
hand please.

337
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,480
If you think Bang Ye-dam
is the next K-pop star...

338
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,630
Please text #0606 with
"Bang Ye-dam" or "No. 1".

339
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:58,660
This stage was by
No. 1 Bang Ye-dam!

340
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,130
Next is another stage prepared
by SM with Andrew Choi!

341
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,640
[Advances to the semifinals
with terrifying force!]

342
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,600
[Andrew Choi's
voice is flawless]

343
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,230
If he showed his singing
skills with that song...

344
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,380
What song will make him
go over that limit?

345
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,780
The next round is
the semifinals.

346
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,990
You have to show the end
that no one ever expected.

347
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,480
Let's make a stage that will
catch them off guard again.

348
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,190
So we chose Justin
Bieber's "Baby".

349
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,630
[Justin Bieber's "Baby"?]

350
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,500
[The song that released
Bang Ye-dam's potential]

351
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,490
Andrew Choi and Justin
Bieber's "Baby". What?

352
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,110
Andrew Choi singing Justin
Bieber's "Baby" is new.

353
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,790
Now we need a stage
with such a twist.

354
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,450
[Andrew tries singing...]

355
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,420
[Completely different feel!]

356
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:25,250
When I first heard it, I thought,
"Wow! 'Baby' can change like this?"

357
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,430
We can beat Ye-dam!

358
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,670
Let's make it bling-bling
as if it's a live show.

359
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:46,600
[Seo Han-young
designer and stylist]

360
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,030
[Hong Joo
hair designer]

361
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,880
I love that hair.

362
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:58,520
There are many people helping me. I
couldn't make it this far without them.

363
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,300
Hi, Andrew!

364
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,640
[Andrew's other
supporters, SHINee]

365
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,910
Congratulations on TOP3!

366
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,840
[SHINee cheers and
congratulates him]

367
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,250
[They give him their autographed
album he worked on as a gift]

368
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,840
[A few days later]

369
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,620
[Where did Andrew arrive?]

370
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,570
[Andrew's friends!]

371
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:57,680
[So far, he looks
the happiest]

372
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,640
It gives me strength that
they came to cheer me.

373
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,240
[Baby - Justin Bieber
(arr. by Kim Tae-sung)]

374
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:33,720
Andrew singing "Baby" was new,
but what did the judges think?

375
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,140
Please tell us the
score and commentary.

376
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:57,950
I think JYP, me, and the viewers were
surprised that he was singing "Baby".

377
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,260
I gave a good commentary for
last week's song because...

378
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,460
When he interpreted it in an R&B style
for the Koreans that knew that song...

379
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:20,830
It satisfied those in Korea and
those that enjoy R&B songs.

380
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:25,570
Bang Ye-dam also sang
Justin Bieber's "Baby".

381
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:32,020
I know why BoA made
such a dangerous move.

382
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:39,510
Since only the TOP3 remains,
she had to take a risk.

383
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:53,560
Kim Yuna wouldn't perform a risky ad-lib
or technique right before the finals.

384
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,780
It's important to take such risks
and try during the preliminaries.

385
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,120
But in the TOP3...

386
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:08,140
We call it a "risk" or "challenge"
because that's how dangerous it is.

387
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:17,240
It was better than expected but
not enough to call it a twist.

388
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,410
YG's score is...

389
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,960
It's YG's score. He said
the twist was weak...

390
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,850
- It's 86!
- Thank you.

391
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:29,010
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

392
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,050
It's true that Andrew showed the most
terrifying transformation since TOP10.

393
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:43,580
I thought his bad habits in vocalization
and breathing would never change, but...

394
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,970
It's incredible that he changed
his 15-year-old habits.

395
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,210
It was shocking.

396
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,540
I thought, "What was
the reason behind it?"

397
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,200
Among the TOP10, he didn't
strive to be the winner.

398
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,560
Thus, he was always relaxed
and naturally made good sounds.

399
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,990
He wanted to win for the
first time in the semifinals.

400
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:13,580
Of course, you should.
But that made you stiff.

401
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,750
You started straining your
voice again here and there.

402
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,400
Maybe you were nervous
since it's the semifinals.

403
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,960
Bang Ye-dam just sang his song
but, it wasn't about singing.

404
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,490
Rather it was how well he got it and
performed on stage and was in rhythm.

405
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:39,090
You chose a great song to show
off your singing skills, but...

406
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,440
Unfortunately, you
didn't explode.

407
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,130
It didn't meet my
expectations.

408
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,650
JYP's score is...

409
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,810
It's JYP's score. He said
that he was nervous...

410
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:53,540
- It's 89!
- Thank you.

411
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:58,560
Last is the score
from BoA of SM.

412
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,470
This is the 2nd stage
we prepared at SM.

413
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,630
Our plan was to have
a 30s "Baby".

414
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,270
You know Andrew Buble? We made
Michael Buble into Andrew Buble.

415
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:22,200
If you had fun, were happy, and sang
without greed, it would've been great.

416
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:30,230
You were stiff today compared
to when you were practicing.

417
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:36,380
As JYP said, I think you wanted
to win for the first time.

418
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,120
It's a pity that your
voice wasn't as open.

419
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:46,020
It's true that this song
was too much for you.

420
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,160
But I'll give you a good score
for putting on a great stage.

421
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,920
SM's score is...

422
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,660
It's SM's score. She said
he was very nervous...

423
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,070
- It's 90!
- Thank you.

424
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,840
The judges' score is 265.

425
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,020
On the stage... were you
satisfied with the stage?

426
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,980
- It was a pity...
- What was?

427
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,900
- I was in bad condition...
- Oh, your condition?

428
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,650
It was a pity that I couldn't
do as much as I could.

429
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,850
Who comes to mind
right now?

430
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,140
A lot of people...

431
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:27,260
- First, my family...
- Your family?

432
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,360
- My parents...
- They're over there.

433
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:37,000
My friends that cheered
me and my girlfriend.

434
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:43,710
And I also thank all the
people that helped me.

435
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,870
Okay. It was pretty long.

436
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:49,930
If you liked Andrew
Choi's stage...

437
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:54,830
Please text #0606 with
"Andrew Choi" or "No. 2".

438
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,550
This stage was by
No. 2 Andrew Choi!

439
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,860
Next is the last TOP3 stage. It's
a great stage prepared with JYP.

440
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,300
Akdong Musician's
stage will start now!

441
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:20,900
They sang 4 songs for me saying that
they wanted to sing their songs.

442
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,320
Among them...

443
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,040
What's "Foreigner's Confession"?

444
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,070
[A unique title that
piqued JYP's interest]

445
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:36,910
We're singing our song,
"Foreigner's Confession".

446
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:42,350
A foreigner from abroad comes and
awkwardly confesses to a Korean.

447
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,910
It's interesting and I kept on
laughing at the first part.

448
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,810
The chorus is
the problem.

449
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:57,050
Rewrite it and
make it fun.

450
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,260
- I can do that.
- You can?

451
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,520
You'll do well.

452
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,390
There's a small book I give
only to our composers.

453
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:13,150
JYP gave us a small notebook that
contains his composition know-hows.

454
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,030
I think he's passionate. He calls us
every day and tries to teach us.

455
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,150
It wasn't our day for shooting,
but he will personally call us.

456
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:30,470
He will hear our songs and teach
us how to supplement it.

457
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,710
[JYP's ultimate
passion project!]

458
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:39,250
Since our concept
is confession...

459
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:44,900
I have to get that feeling to
write the chorus part well.

460
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,790
Lee Soo, who's your
ideal person?

461
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:50,450
Hurry, who?

462
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,020
And Chan-hyuk?

463
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,210
- Suzy.
- Suzy?

464
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,640
[He's a big fan of
miss A's Suzy]

465
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,550
Take him to the set then.

466
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,940
He'll have the
heart to confess.

467
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,100
He has to see her to
be able to write.

468
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,730
To see Suzy...

469
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,250
I was given that privilege.

470
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,810
You're blushing.

471
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,130
[Off to Yongin where
Suzy is filming!]

472
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,230
- Hello?
- Hello.

473
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:28,700
I think she's
in that car.

474
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:33,210
Hello.

475
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,930
[Suzy - Korea's first love
with a beautiful face]

476
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,210
[Dumbfounded by this
dreamlike realtiy]

477
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:42,640
I'm your fan!

478
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:46,830
The sun's in my eyes.

479
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,840
[He's senseless because of
her beauty that's like the sun]

480
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,140
I love that song...
"Crescendo".

481
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,890
[As soon as she's
done speaking]

482
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,770
[Preparation done]

483

[A song for Suzy]

484

[Akdong Musician and Suzy
unite with "Crescendo"]

485
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,580
All together now.

486
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:15,540
Do you have a song you
are singing this time?

487
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:20,830
We're singing our song
about confession...

488
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:25,350
If I see you, then I...

489
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,900
[He's embarrassed to continue]

490
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,590
Can I hear that too?

491
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,950
Of course!

492
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,650
- It's "Foreigner's Confession".
- He's even kneeling down.

493
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,120
[She follows him
and sits also]

494
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,750
[Even listening to music
is like a photo shoot]

495
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,760
- That's it.
- That's great!

496
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,100
It'll be a hit.

497
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,460
I'll give you
some energy.

498
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,380
She's prettier in person.

499
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,330
[They receive all
of her support]

500
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:05,610
She said she's our fan
and treated us well.

501
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:09,640
I think that gives us strength
and we can do better on stage.

502
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,340
Will we see you again?

503
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:22,200
Their music and stage
upgraded one level.

504
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,740
Look forward to it.

505
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
[Foreigner's Confession - own song
(arr. by Wasabii Sound)]

506
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,480
It was their new song. What
did the judges think?

507
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,430
Let's hear the score
and commentary.

508
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,420
Why are the contestants off key
and not in rhythm today?

509
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,270
Not only you guys, but also
Ye-dam and Andrew Choi.

510
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:03,920
Soo-hyun, when you
started the song off...

511
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:12,740
You missed the first note and Chan-hyuk,
even though the register was low...

512
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,750
You were unstable.

513
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:23,620
The music was great but since
you two were unstable...

514
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,750
I want to listen to
the sound source.

515
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:35,320
The lyrics were cleverly written
as expected from you guys.

516
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,280
You guys are the greatest and
cute when you sing your songs.

517
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,450
I enjoyed it.
SM's score is...

518
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,930
She said the lyrics were
clever, but they were unstable.

519
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,830
The score is... 91!

520
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:50,820
That's a good score.

521
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,470
Let's hear the next
score and commentary.

522
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:00,160
I felt the same
thing BoA said.

523
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:06,180
This happens a lot even to existing
singers. I know JYP did well, but...

524
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,160
It would have been stable if
the key was a half note higher.

525
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,930
It's true that it
was low for them.

526
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,070
The title of the song is
"Foreigner's Confession".

527
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:23,200
Just looking at the title, "How could
they write lyrics with such an idea?"

528
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,180
I always think that
they're unique.

529
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:35,040
As BoA said, I read the
lyrics as they sang.

530
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,570
Since a foreigner can't speak Korean
well when confessing to the woman...

531
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,620
It was clever how they used
simple English words.

532
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:52,040
Maybe it's because it's their own songs,
I don't feel like I'm watching their stage.

533
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,410
It always feel like an existing
singer announcing their new album.

534
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,910
YG's score is...

535
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:04,400
It's YG's score. He said
their lyrics were clever.

536
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,440
It's 92! That's
a high score.

537
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,160
Last is JYP's score.

538
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,160
I was excited to work with
them this week because...

539
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:23,320
They're the only contestants I could
see composing and write music.

540
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,640
I always tell my
junior composers...

541
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:35,110
Whenever you start writing, start with
the heart and complete with the head.

542
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:42,280
The music written by Chan-hyuk
was only from the heart because...

543
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,110
Unexpectedly, he doesn't know
any chord progressions.

544
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:51,600
I taught him a few simple things since
he doesn't know what he's doing.

545
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,550
He really enjoys studying. Usually,
sentimental people don't like it.

546
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,040
I teach him a little
and he's having fun.

547
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,890
He writes it down and
starts memorizing.

548
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:09,060
I felt that he'll now write music starting
with the heart and ending with the head.

549
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:13,190
I thought that a lot because if
you only write from the heart...

550
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:18,290
You could get a lot of big hits,
but you don't compose for long.

551
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:25,790
But if you only write with the head, you
do it a long time without many big hits.

552
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:32,860
I can't really say this now, but I think
Chan-hyuk will be a great composer.

553
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,670
I think this song will
also be a big hit.

554
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:37,950
JYP's score is...

555
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,660
He gave much advice
in composition.

556
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,900
It's JYP's score.

557
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,630
It's 94!

558
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:51,000
The judges' score is 277.
It's the highest so far.

559
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:56,020
They were unstable but
got a good score.

560
00:53:56,020 --> 00:54:02,370
Chan-hyuk, who did you think
of as you sang? Was it...

561
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,160
Su...

562
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,240
Was it her? Did
it help you?

563
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,880
It was a lot of...

564
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,260
You couldn't even
look at her.

565
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,980
Alright. We'll end
the interview.

566
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:22,400

Musician again next week...

567
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:28,000
Please text #0606 with
"Akdong Musician" or "No. 3".

568
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,470
This stage was by No. 3
Akdong Musician!

569
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:40,690
The TOP3 stages are now over,
and they all did their best.

570
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:44,920
I'm very curious who will
advance to the finals.

571
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:51,150
Akdong Musician has the highest judges'
score, but we don't know the results yet.

572
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:54,620
According to the votes,
their fate can change.

573
00:54:54,620 --> 00:55:01,250
We have a special program waiting
for us before voting is over. Boom?

574
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,950
Yes, that's right. I'm here
with the audience again.

TOP3's special stage.

Jo Kwon and Changmin of 2AM...

Jia of miss A will help.

and sang with SHINee. It was great.

the specials, are over now.

will advance to the finals?

Bang Ye-dam, Andrew Choi, and
Akdong Musician are anxiously waiting.

Before the announcements,
let's hear how they feel.

612

Bang Ye-dam, you're
nervous, right?

613
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,540
I'm really nervous.

01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:46,790
Do you think all
will be well?

615
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:48,860
I'm not sure.

616
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,530
Alright. Andrew Choi,
how do you feel?

617
01:11:53,530 --> 01:12:00,150
I'm really nervous because
both of them did well.

since they did very well.

619

Akdong Musician?

620
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:09,940
It's a pity because we
made a lot of mistakes.

621
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:14,980
Nervous because you made mistakes.
But all of you should be nervous.

622
01:12:14,980 --> 01:12:24,910
I feel it too. Regardless of rank,
we'll announce who passed.

will advance first?

Bang Ye-dam showed a new side
and heard many good things.

626
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:55,940
Andrew Choi also did well, but
he was unstable and nervous.

Akdong Musician received a lot
of compliments for their song.

628

here is unbelievable.

one of them gets eliminated.

on an impressive stage.

01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,300
Should I announce
the results?

662
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:05,290
Should I?

663
01:16:05,290 --> 01:16:06,200
Here I go.

664
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:16,350
KPOP STAR's finalist is...

665
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:24,740
Bang Ye-dam!

666
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,490
Congratulations,
Bang Ye-dam.

667
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:31,640
For someone so young,
this must be unbearable.

668
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:36,530
But you made it
to the finals.

669
01:16:36,530 --> 01:16:42,330
As they congratulate and
cheer for Bang Ye-dam...

670
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:47,670
Unfortunately, Andrew Choi
will be leaving KPOP STAR.

671
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,370
First, Bang Ye-dam?

672
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:54,620
If it's okay... He's
crying right now.

673
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,900
How do you feel?
Do you...

674
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:02,280
- I'm very happy.
- Are you?

675
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:04,340
Why are you crying?

676
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:09,450
Because Andrew is leaving...

677
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:12,830
It must break your heart.
A hand for him please.

678
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:17,050
We were proud of you.

679
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:22,650
Andrew Choi, you got eliminated
with the finals right before you.

680
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:30,600
Any last words for the viewers, fans,
and family that cheered for you?

681
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:34,450
- Can I say it in English?
- Yes, we have JYP.

682
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:58,730
Could JYP interpret that?

683
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,840
He thanked God
and everyone.

684
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:09,380
You release an album, get a car,
and cash if you win here.

685
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:13,930
Can you compare that to a song
sung by a woman who loves you?

686
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:14,620
That's cool.

687
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:18,690
Basically, he's already a
winner with that gift.

688
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:25,380
In many cases, lovers broke up
after the audition was over.

689
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,790
But I don't think this
couple will break up.

690
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:31,620
That's right. They're
a beautiful couple.

691
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:35,690
JYP, any advice for Andrew
since you have the mike?

692
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:44,860
I saw many great stages and towards
the end, you impressed me a lot.

693
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:46,900
I enjoyed it and
congratulations.

694
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:53,090
Thank you JYP and another
hand for Andrew Choi.

695
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:59,250
Do the others want to say anything?
YG? BoA? BoA may go first.

696
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:08,710
I worked with Andrew the
most and got really close.

697
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:18,170
I was impressed with his stages that
showed age doesn't matter in music.

698
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:24,850
Not only as a composer and producer, but
we would also like to see you as a singer.

699
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:27,860
- You did well.
- Thank you.

700
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:32,070
The long-awaited finals
will be next week.

701
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:33,900
See you next week!
Goodbye!

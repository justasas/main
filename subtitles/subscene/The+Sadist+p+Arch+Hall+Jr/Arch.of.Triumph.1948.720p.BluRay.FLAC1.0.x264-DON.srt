1
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,075
The winter of 1938

2
00:01:58,148 --> 00:02:02,610
was one year before the beginning
of the Second World War,

3
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:08,058
and Paris was still an island of light
in the darkness of Europe.

4
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:12,462
And everywhere, men saw
the new European citizen...

5
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,058
the refugee.

6
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,433
And on the streets,

7
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:21,465
political refugees rubbed shoulders
with the refugees from life.

8
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:26,242
And no one cared
if these men and women lived or died.

9
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:29,513
So history prepared the end of an era

10
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:32,579
and the beginning of our times.

11
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,077
Your friend's escaped.

12
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,413
Halt!

13
00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,747
Sybil Fildorf.

14
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,021
She had nothing to do with it.

15
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,181
Sybil Fildorf.

16
00:03:00,257 --> 00:03:01,554
Was never in my confidence.

17
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:04,093
- Sybil Fildorf.
- I scarcely know her.

18
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:05,651
Sybil Fildorf!

19
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,450
- What happened on the road?
- I don't know.

20
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:10,059
You don't know, you don't know.
Tell me what you know.

21
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:12,194
She knows nothing.
There is nothing to know.

22
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:13,932
She will know.

23
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:16,373
Crack.

24
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,773
- You know.
- I don't know.

25
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,477
Yes.

26
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,711
<i>Oziri zigarette.
They're gold-tipped.</i>

27
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,922
You have given us unnecessary trouble.

28
00:03:40,538 --> 00:03:42,903
<i>Ja, she's dead.</i>

29
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,771
You're quite right.
She did not know.

30
00:03:44,843 --> 00:03:47,506
Is a pity.

31
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,569
My apologies.

32
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:05,659
Your bill, sir.

33
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,065
Certainly.

34
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:35,297
This raid,

35
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:37,737
the police pick up this fellow Polyanski

36
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:39,205
in some bistro.

37
00:04:39,275 --> 00:04:41,072
He told them where he lived.

38
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,440
Did they catch anyone else?

39
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:43,774
No, no, no, no.

40
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:47,443
Madam Favier was able to get them
all down to the cellar.

41
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:52,280
Ah, good evening, Colonel.
Dr. Ravic.

42
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,756
Good evening.

43
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,589
Good evening.

44
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,493
Let us play game of billiards, eh?

45
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:00,396
Police will probably be
busy upstairs for some time.

46
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,694
All right.

47
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,326
- Name?
- Mueller.

48
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,996
You keep out of this.

49
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,334
Name?

50
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,171
Polyanski.

51
00:05:08,243 --> 00:05:09,835
Vladislav Polyanski?

52
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:12,176
Didn't you know this man had no papers?

53
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,113
I wasn't on the desk when he registered.

54
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,550
Alois, if you ever let another person
register without papers...

55
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,281
Never mind that.

56
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:20,186
This isn't your first offense.

57
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,554
I'm sorry, but this time,

58
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:23,856
you'll get six months
before we deport you.

59
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,259
Next time, it'll be worse.

60
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,490
It's the law.

61
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:29,864
I saw Haake.

62
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,197
Again?

63
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,533
Uh, are you sure?

64
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:34,505
Yes.

65
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:35,837
Did he see you?

66
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,934
No.

67
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:38,739
Do you think he would recognize you

68
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:40,371
if he did see you?

69
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:41,437
He thinks I'm dead.

70
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:44,212
Lucky for your friends at home.

71
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,278
He recognized Krauss.

72
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:49,757
Krauss has no friends left.

73
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,316
Ghosts.

74
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:53,659
I thought I would be over this by now.

75
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,893
Eh. One never is.

76
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:59,527
I am still waiting
for three Franco Spaniards.

77
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,299
That's my dream.

78
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,967
Everybody in this room has his dream.

79
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,216
Rappaport, over there,

80
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:14,050
he dreams they are pulling out
his fingernails again.

81
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:16,716
Krings dreams they are chasing him down

82
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,053
<i>Unter der Linden.</i>

83
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:21,290
He runs and runs,
but they always catch him.

84
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:24,356
Schultz,

85
00:06:24,434 --> 00:06:27,335
his friends call him The Bird of Death.

86
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:31,069
He dreams of the next disaster.

87
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,772
He left Berlin two weeks
before Hitler came to power.

88
00:06:34,846 --> 00:06:38,509
He left Vienna three days
before the Nazis came in.

89
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,122
My dream is Sybil's face

90
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:46,250
after they had finished with her.

91
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,761
She couldn't tell them anything
because she knew nothing.

92
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,195
She was not in my confidence.

93
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:53,292
She meant no more to me
than a beautiful painting.

94
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,802
They expected her to crack,
but she didn't crack.

95
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,601
She let them kill her,
right before my eyes.

96
00:06:58,674 --> 00:06:59,936
Haake killed her.

97
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:02,478
She had a world of courage,
but no great strength.

98
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:05,141
She lasted a very little while.

99
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,150
You will have your revenge, Ravic.

100
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,982
These crimes cannot go unpunished.

101
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:13,256
Revenge? No, not revenge.

102
00:07:13,326 --> 00:07:16,318
Revenge is a personal thing.
This is something bigger.

103
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:20,993
Sybil's face is now the symbol
of thousands of beaten faces.

104
00:07:21,068 --> 00:07:23,002
Haake must never leave France.

105
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,905
Each time he returns to Berlin,
innocent people die.

106
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,137
By the hundreds, they die.

107
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,177
Let me go.

108
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,683
Let me go.

109
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,355
Go where?

110
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:12,759
Leave me alone.

111
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,855
You're not well.

112
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,766
Let me get you a cab
and send you home.

113
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,601
What?

114
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,043
Did you hear me?

115
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:29,675
I said I'll put you in a cab and send you
to your apartment, your hotel.

116
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,012
Hotel?

117
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,142
Or wherever you live.

118
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,687
No, not my hotel.

119
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,222
Then where?

120
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:41,058
Look, if you're thinking
of taking a swim, don't.

121
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:44,100
It's the wrong time of year.
The water is too cold.

122
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:47,534
I hadn't thought of it.

123
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:51,939
Oh, well, then, I won't be responsible
for putting ideas in your head.

124
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,272
Come.

125
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:55,279
I know a little place around the corner.

126
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:58,078
You need a drink to warm you up.

127
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:00,279
Come on.

128
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:03,084
The bridge will always be here.

129
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:06,118
What do you want to drink?

130
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:07,456
Anything.

131
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,895
Two Calvados and a package
of Chesterfields.

132
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:11,193
Only French.

133
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:13,462
Then give me a package
of Laurents... Green.

134
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:14,628
Only Blue.

135
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:23,278
All right, Blue.

136
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:26,182
I may still have one Green left.

137
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,119
Green. Found one after all.

138
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,494
Were you in the Navy?

139
00:09:37,565 --> 00:09:38,759
No, the circus.

140
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,824
Oh, better still.

141
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:42,927
Here, drink this.

142
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,597
Drink it all at once.

143
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:46,767
For a moment, it will give you the illusion

144
00:09:46,843 --> 00:09:49,505
that you are living in a hot, dry country.

145
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,542
Which way are you going?

146
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,749
I don't know.

147
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,049
Where do you live?

148
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,784
I can't go there, not there.

149
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,692
Don't you know anyone
to whom you can go?

150
00:10:02,762 --> 00:10:04,559
You could call them up from here.

151
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,761
No.

152
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,027
No, there is nobody.

153
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,831
But you must go somewhere.

154
00:10:10,904 --> 00:10:12,667
Haven't you any money for a room?

155
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:15,174
Yes, yes, I have.

156
00:10:15,243 --> 00:10:16,710
Then go to a hotel.

157
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:18,100
Look, you've got to go somewhere.

158
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:20,172
You can't stay
in the streets in this rain.

159
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,182
Yes, you're right.

160
00:10:25,255 --> 00:10:26,517
You're quite right.

161
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,853
Don't trouble about me anymore.

162
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:32,054
I'll find a place.

163
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,620
Thank you for everything.

164
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,978
All right.

165
00:10:53,054 --> 00:10:54,488
Come with me.

166
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:56,684
We'll find something for you.

167
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,988
Thank you.

168
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,979
This room was empty yesterday.

169
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,320
Madame Favier must have locked it
for fear the bedbugs will get away.

170
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,462
Sit down a moment.

171
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,966
I'll try from the balcony side.

172
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:47,981
It's no use.

173
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,954
The window is locked, too.

174
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:56,325
May I sit here for a moment?

175
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,830
You can sleep here.

176
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,767
That's the easiest thing.

177
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,168
You should have
left me on the street.

178
00:12:03,238 --> 00:12:05,001
You won't disturb me.

179
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:08,134
It's not the first time
someone has stayed here all night

180
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:10,806
because he had nowhere else to go.

181
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:13,008
This is a hotel for refugees,

182
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:16,019
people with prices on their heads,

183
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:19,114
people who hang themselves
the next morning

184
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:21,183
or leave for Peru.

185
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,522
You can take the bed.

186
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,688
I'll sleep on the sofa. I'm used to it.

187
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,630
No, no, I'Il...

188
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,930
I'll just stay where I am.

189
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:34,509
If I may only sit here, that's all.

190
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:37,375
Just as you like.

191
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:39,039
Better take off your coat.

192
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,173
It's quite wet.

193
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,944
Your hat, too.

194
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,627
Now your shoes.

195
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:01,565
Take off your stockings.

196
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,577
I'll get you a pair of woolen ones.

197
00:13:06,815 --> 00:13:09,648
In critical times,
have an eye for comfort.

198
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:11,744
That's an old soldier's maxim.

199
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,553
Hello?

200
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:16,752
Oh, oh, yes, Veber.

201
00:13:16,827 --> 00:13:20,092
I'll be there at once.

202
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:21,994
I've got to go out.

203
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:26,334
It's all right. You can stay here.

204
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,703
Can't I go with you?

205
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:29,900
No, no, impossible.

206
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,967
You stay here and take whatever you need.

207
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,239
Oh, here.

208
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,613
You'll find pajamas
in the bottom drawer.

209
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:38,777
Thank you.

210
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,650
Please, may I keep the light on?

211
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:46,455
I wasn't going to turn it off.

212
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:48,326
I know that feeling.

213
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:10,651
Lucien.

214
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,420
Where is my Lucien?

215
00:14:32,584 --> 00:14:33,676
How is she?

216
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:36,448
Pulse, 100.

217
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:39,389
Pressure, 110 over 80.

218
00:14:57,046 --> 00:15:00,346
Pulse is weak and thready, 140.

219
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,715
Pressure, 70 over 40.

220
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:09,350
I can't get her pressure.

221
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,693
Is she gone?

222
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,165
Yes.

223
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:19,028
You did all you could, Ravic.

224
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,903
We can't win against quacks.

225
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,145
Love,

226
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:28,877
your magic spell is everywhere.

227
00:15:28,951 --> 00:15:33,389
The bracelet on her ankle read,
"Always, Lucien."

228
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:36,051
Where is Lucien now?

229
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:39,893
21 years old, Veber.

230
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:42,694
21 years old.

231
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:45,396
The dignity of man,
the beauty of woman,

232
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:48,669
the innocence and subtlety of love,

233
00:15:48,742 --> 00:15:51,610
a quack in a dirty cellar,

234
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,941
then this.

235
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,446
By now you should be tough.

236
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:55,709
One is never tough,

237
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,115
but one can get used to a lot of things.

238
00:15:58,186 --> 00:15:59,346
That's what I mean.

239
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,390
But with some things, never.

240
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:07,887
Good night, Colonel.

241
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,777
Drive on.

242
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,790
Hello, hello!

243
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,257
Hello, Boris.

244
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:34,818
Eh, busy again
with scientific murder, eh?

245
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:39,961
Is idiotic, a doctor of your ability
not allowed to work everywhere,

246
00:16:40,036 --> 00:16:41,901
but must hide out as ghost surgeon.

247
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,132
I'm not alone.

248
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:44,572
The Nazis saw to that.

249
00:16:44,642 --> 00:16:46,974
Colonel.

250
00:16:47,044 --> 00:16:48,637
A racing car.

251
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:55,311
You don't laugh?

252
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:57,720
But, Colonel, it was a good joke.

253
00:16:57,791 --> 00:16:59,053
Or wasn't it?

254
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,787
Very good.

255
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,956
But racing car was, perhaps, even better.

256
00:17:04,032 --> 00:17:05,693
Come on.

257
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:12,004
Mind your manners, Boris.

258
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,304
You know, he might
complain to your boss.

259
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:16,676
Oh, Captain Alidze?

260
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,840
He was lieutenant in the Tsar's Guard.

261
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,475
I was lieutenant-colonel.

262
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,110
He still remembers that, my boy.

263
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:23,711
You had better remember it, too,

264
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:27,452
you pickpocket of death without passport.

265
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:29,188
When are you going to be through?

266
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:31,229
Right after we have drink on the house.

267
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:32,765
Come along.

268
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,380
It's all right.

269
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:47,416
It's me,

270
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,110
the man who brought you here.

271
00:17:52,957 --> 00:17:56,051
I think we can turn the light off now.

272
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,152
I thought you would be gone.

273
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,199
I'll go.

274
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,392
Never mind.

275
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,661
Wait.

276
00:18:02,735 --> 00:18:04,226
We'll have some breakfast.

277
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:12,134
Here, drink your coffee.

278
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:17,751
You got a headache?

279
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,980
No.

280
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:20,522
Well, I have.

281
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:23,058
But it'll be gone in an hour.

282
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,095
Have a brioche.

283
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,390
I can't eat.

284
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:28,932
Well, drink your coffee
and have a cigarette.

285
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,865
That's a soldier's breakfast.

286
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,729
I think...

287
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:36,741
What do you think?

288
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:40,074
I think I should be going.

289
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,341
Back to your hotel?

290
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:44,613
Perhaps you should.

291
00:18:44,686 --> 00:18:47,119
You've got to face it,
whatever it is, sometime.

292
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,486
Things may look different
to him in daylight.

293
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:56,194
What's the matter?

294
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,162
Did I say something wrong?

295
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:02,604
He's dead.

296
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:09,945
He died last night.

297
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,540
Then I ran away.

298
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:15,419
That makes it perfect.

299
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,480
Did you kill him?

300
00:19:24,968 --> 00:19:26,992
That makes it less perfect.

301
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:29,004
You'd better tell me the details.

302
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:33,442
He died...

303
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,273
suddenly.

304
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:37,508
Are you sure you didn't kill him?

305
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:43,886
I didn't shoot him or stab him,
if that's what you mean.

306
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:46,083
All right, he died naturally.
He was sick.

307
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:47,557
Did you have a doctor?

308
00:19:47,626 --> 00:19:50,858
I called one, but he wouldn't
let the doctor touch him.

309
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:52,523
Why not?

310
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,025
Because of me.

311
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:02,704
Did you notify the management
of the hotel he was dead?

312
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:03,836
No.

313
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,972
That makes it perfect again.

314
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:08,244
Why the devil didn't you give me a choice?

315
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:10,913
If I'd known, I would have
left you on the bridge.

316
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,319
I'm sorry. I'll go.

317
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,551
Oh, no, you won't go.

318
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,321
The police will want to know
where you spent the night.

319
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:17,658
I won't tell them.

320
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,992
If you went there alone,

321
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:21,466
they will be knocking
on my door ten minutes later.

322
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:22,661
No, no, no, wait.

323
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:24,327
I'll get dressed and go with you.

324
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:26,066
You don't have
to help me anymore.

325
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,767
I'm not helping you,
I'm helping myself.

326
00:20:27,841 --> 00:20:30,208
This is not my year to see the police.

327
00:20:32,747 --> 00:20:35,376
Was he your husband?

328
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,850
No.

329
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:49,762
So you're back.

330
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:51,097
You think you can disappear

331
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,865
and leave me to answer
questions to the police?

332
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:56,102
You disgraced my hotel with that...
that thing you left upstairs.

333
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:58,645
You believe, no doubt,
that I've settled this whole mess for you.

334
00:20:58,712 --> 00:21:00,612
Well, I haven't.
You're back to go to prison.

335
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:02,642
- And if I have anything...
- You come from China?

336
00:21:03,484 --> 00:21:04,416
What do you mean?

337
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:06,545
Nothing. I just wanted to interrupt you.

338
00:21:06,621 --> 00:21:09,055
You would've gone on talking
for another hour.

339
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,257
Sit down over there.

340
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:22,566
Do you know the name
of the doctor who was here?

341
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,437
Bonet. Marcel Bonet.

342
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:25,977
Passi 2743.

343
00:21:26,045 --> 00:21:29,037
Phone Dr. Bonet to come right over
and sign the death certificate.

344
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,208
Get out.

345
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:31,841
Why do you stand around stealing my time?

346
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:33,146
Get out!

347
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,984
And close the door behind you,

348
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:38,220
unless you want the people
from the street to come in here, too.

349
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,559
Well...

350
00:21:50,074 --> 00:21:52,907
There doesn't seem to be
any sign of violence.

351
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:05,247
Why did you run away last night?

352
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:09,657
When I came back, he was dead.

353
00:22:09,731 --> 00:22:10,698
Back from where?

354
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,858
We quarreled.

355
00:22:12,934 --> 00:22:14,027
What about?

356
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:16,863
The doctor.

357
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:18,702
Oh. The doctor again.

358
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:21,470
All right. Now, look.
The police will want to make a list

359
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:23,012
of what belonged to each of you.

360
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,547
Did he have any relatives?

361
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:26,981
Not in France.

362
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:28,985
Take everything
that's important to you, and quickly.

363
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,249
There's no time left for sentimentality.

364
00:22:31,323 --> 00:22:32,790
Where is his luggage?

365
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:36,061
It was over there
by the wall last night.

366
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:39,121
Oh, I see. The proprietor.

367
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:42,397
Mother, you are much
too inquisitive for your age.

368
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:44,130
Get me the proprietor, please.

369
00:22:48,476 --> 00:22:50,308
He said I only sent for the doctor

370
00:22:50,379 --> 00:22:52,313
because I wanted him to get well.

371
00:22:54,885 --> 00:22:58,252
I'll see that you get
the first prize for incoherence.

372
00:22:58,322 --> 00:22:59,448
I was taking care of him,

373
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:02,152
but he said I only wanted him
to get well so I could leave him.

374
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:07,425
- Did you?
- Yes.

375
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:11,736
Well, you have definitely left him now.

376
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:13,999
No, I haven't.

377
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:16,976
I haven't. Not this way.

378
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:18,341
Why did you want to leave him?

379
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:20,844
He loved me.

380
00:23:25,354 --> 00:23:27,016
But I didn't love him.

381
00:23:35,532 --> 00:23:37,625
Where are the suitcases?

382
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:38,794
First, the bill.

383
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,132
First, the suitcases.

384
00:23:40,205 --> 00:23:43,300
No one has refused to pay the bill... yet.

385
00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:45,537
And next time, knock before you enter.

386
00:23:48,882 --> 00:23:51,044
Did he keep any money in his suitcases?

387
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,710
Why, I don't know.

388
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:55,585
Marino always had money in his wallet.

389
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:56,681
Where is it?

390
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,388
He kept it under his pillow.

391
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,837
American money.

392
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:16,175
A hundred dollars.

393
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,581
I left the wallet where I found it.
Take it.

394
00:24:20,186 --> 00:24:22,177
You can live on this for a while.

395
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:24,622
Otherwise, it will rot
at police headquarters.

396
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:28,361
Thank you.

397
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,454
Come in.

398
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:34,963
Are these all?

399
00:24:35,037 --> 00:24:36,766
Naturally these are all.

400
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,205
Is the bill right?

401
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:41,073
Well, pay it anyway.

402
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:43,136
Uh, 297.

403
00:24:46,451 --> 00:24:48,181
- One...
- One...

404
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,617
300 francs.

405
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,214
300 francs.

406
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,158
We get three francs change.

407
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:56,456
The concierge?

408
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,224
That we'll settle ourselves.

409
00:25:01,802 --> 00:25:02,861
Thank you.

410
00:25:05,807 --> 00:25:07,776
Now the suitcases.

411
00:25:07,844 --> 00:25:09,573
You may find something you'd want.

412
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,740
Well...

413
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,338
the rest is for the police.

414
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:17,410
When one is dead,
one becomes very important.

415
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:20,287
Would you like to go downstairs
and wait for the police there?

416
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:22,349
No. I'll stay here.

417
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:23,986
There is nothing to do here.

418
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:25,928
I know, but...

419
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,229
he won't be here much longer.

420
00:25:28,301 --> 00:25:30,098
I often...

421
00:25:32,506 --> 00:25:34,667
He wasn't very happy with me.

422
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,334
I was often away.

423
00:25:37,512 --> 00:25:39,105
Now I'll stay.

424
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:41,115
He won't know.

425
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,878
It's not that.

426
00:25:42,952 --> 00:25:45,216
All right. Well, I'll watch the proceedings

427
00:25:45,288 --> 00:25:46,755
from the bistro across the street.

428
00:25:46,823 --> 00:25:47,882
Here.

429
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:49,718
Come to the window
when the police have gone.

430
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:52,093
I'll come to the window
in my room on the floor above.

431
00:26:33,912 --> 00:26:35,174
Did it go well?

432
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:36,681
There was no trouble.

433
00:26:36,749 --> 00:26:38,046
What are you going to do now?

434
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:41,054
I don't know.

435
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:45,187
I suppose you don't want
to stay on in this hotel.

436
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,522
No.

437
00:26:46,595 --> 00:26:48,256
You should try the Hotel de Milan.

438
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,490
It's clean and decent.

439
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:52,328
Couldn't I go to the hotel where...

440
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:54,425
To your hotel?

441
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:57,171
The International?

442
00:26:58,175 --> 00:26:59,541
Yes, l...

443
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:00,942
I know it somehow now.

444
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,707
It's better than what I haven't seen.

445
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:08,242
Well, the International
is not the right hotel for you.

446
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,054
You're right. I'll go to the other.

447
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:31,575
Is this all right?

448
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,583
Yes. Very good.

449
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,745
At least it seems to be clean.

450
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,809
Yes.

451
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:50,560
I think you'll be all right here.

452
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:52,765
Yes, thanks. Many thanks.

453
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,774
You should go to bed.

454
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,107
Do you think you'll be able to sleep?

455
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,237
I'll try.

456
00:27:59,348 --> 00:28:01,283
Well, I'll go now.

457
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,182
I'll look you up one of these days.

458
00:28:12,864 --> 00:28:14,627
What's your name?

459
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,632
Madou.

460
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:16,726
Joan Madou.

461
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:17,963
Joan Madou.

462
00:28:18,037 --> 00:28:19,629
I'll remember it.

463
00:28:19,706 --> 00:28:22,505
Well, perhaps I'd better write it down.

464
00:28:23,544 --> 00:28:25,136
Here.

465
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:27,146
You write it yourself.

466
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:28,239
It's simpler.

467
00:28:33,022 --> 00:28:34,785
Now go to bed.

468
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:36,587
All you need is a little time,

469
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,992
a certain amount of time
that you have to get through.

470
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:40,826
You understand.

471
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,160
Yes.

472
00:28:42,233 --> 00:28:44,997
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

473
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:47,867
I really don't know what
I would have done without you.

474
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:49,339
I really don't know.

475
00:29:24,784 --> 00:29:26,718
Spain, the fascist section,

476
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:29,381
celebrating a German or Italian victory

477
00:29:29,456 --> 00:29:30,889
over their own people.

478
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:42,035
This was left for Dr. Ravic.

479
00:29:42,104 --> 00:29:43,571
Here.

480
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:45,835
I'm not expecting a package.
Who brought it?

481
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,206
A woman. A... A lady.

482
00:29:47,277 --> 00:29:48,643
Well, which, woman or lady?

483
00:29:48,713 --> 00:29:49,771
Just... Just in between.

484
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:52,042
- Pretty sharp, eh?
- There's no name on it.

485
00:29:52,116 --> 00:29:54,210
- Did she say it was for me?
- Not just like that.

486
00:29:54,286 --> 00:29:56,087
She said it was for
the doctor who lives here.

487
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:56,952
You know the lady.

488
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:58,624
She was here with you the other morning.

489
00:29:59,892 --> 00:30:02,588
First virtue of hotel employees
is discretion.

490
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:04,186
Indiscretion is only for gentlemen.

491
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,275
Lieutenant Navarro,
aide-de-camp to Colonel Gómez.

492
00:30:14,343 --> 00:30:16,664
The colonel requests you
to drink a glass of wine with him.

493
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,978
We are about to play game of chess.

494
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,483
You did a service for Colonel Gómez
some time ago.

495
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:23,178
This match must not be postponed.

496
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:25,518
Oh, no. It's for the championship.

497
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,891
What service did you render
this tin soldier?

498
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,730
I prescribed a laxative for him.

499
00:30:35,802 --> 00:30:38,464
A fascist in the same situation

500
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:41,531
would have prescribed
for a Democrat a poison.

501
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,408
What's this? From a Russian?

502
00:30:44,478 --> 00:30:46,913
No. Oh, I told you about her.

503
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:48,917
So she's the one.

504
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:50,179
Yes.

505
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:52,221
It's a busy day, eh? Come in.

506
00:30:53,223 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm Captain Gonzales.

507
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,718
We are leaving tonight
to join the glorious army

508
00:30:56,794 --> 00:30:58,091
of Generalissimo Franco.

509
00:30:58,162 --> 00:31:01,655
The colonel would like to drink with you
to Spain and Spain's army.

510
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:03,633
Captain, I'm not a...

511
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:04,633
a Spaniard.

512
00:31:04,702 --> 00:31:06,671
We know that.
You are an Austrian.

513
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,831
That makes you German.

514
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,500
Germany and Spain are friends.

515
00:31:10,544 --> 00:31:11,636
Please give our regrets

516
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:13,771
to Colonel Gómez,
but the results of our game

517
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:16,544
must be cabled tonight
to New York and Calcutta.

518
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:18,016
We expected you to decline.

519
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,125
We only invited you
because you are with the doctor.

520
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:21,952
Don't you think we've had
about enough of this?

521
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:23,218
Yes, Colonel.

522
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,319
I think the simplest thing
is that you go back to your friends.

523
00:31:28,598 --> 00:31:29,759
Thank you.

524
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:32,598
Thank you for promoting me
to rank of full colonel.

525
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:36,731
Well, I knew, of course, that you were
only a miserable lieutenant-colonel,

526
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,673
but it seems unbearable to me

527
00:31:38,743 --> 00:31:41,269
that you shouldn't have
the same rank as this Gómez.

528
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,382
Have you, uh...

529
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,975
Have you seen her again?

530
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,042
No.

531
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,852
Uh. This, of course, is a cry for help.

532
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,061
Hmm. I suppose so.

533
00:31:54,129 --> 00:31:55,652
Go see her, Ravic.

534
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,719
Why?

535
00:31:56,798 --> 00:31:59,893
Well, because the colonel says so.

536
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:04,038
All right, all right.
I'll go and see her tomorrow.

537
00:32:08,312 --> 00:32:09,405
Colonel Gómez.

538
00:32:09,481 --> 00:32:10,607
This will be discussion

539
00:32:10,682 --> 00:32:12,547
between two colonels, a short one.

540
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,083
- Gentlemen...
- Make no statement.

541
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:18,748
It will only cause conflict.

542
00:32:18,825 --> 00:32:20,087
Now get out.

543
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,094
You should've got out
long ago, you know...

544
00:32:22,162 --> 00:32:24,062
to Spain, to fight.

545
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:27,590
Germans and Italians
have fought for you there instead.

546
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,138
I am unable to challenge you.

547
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:31,468
I am leaving Paris tonight.

548
00:32:33,109 --> 00:32:35,100
The fee for your consultation.

549
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:36,940
No. One moment.

550
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:38,242
One moment, please.

551
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:47,716
That is to sober you up! Now get out!

552
00:32:47,793 --> 00:32:49,595
And remember in the future
not to throw money,

553
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:50,528
you medieval idiots!

554
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:51,621
Get out!

555
00:32:51,698 --> 00:32:53,187
Get out, get out!

556
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:56,593
You.

557
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:00,833
If only you were not illegal,

558
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:03,434
I could've committed
magnificent damage.

559
00:33:03,512 --> 00:33:05,173
God bless your eyes.

560
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:06,476
- And yours.
- Right.

561
00:33:09,887 --> 00:33:11,650
The lady's in her room.

562
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,188
Uh, what's the number?

563
00:33:13,256 --> 00:33:14,485
27.

564
00:33:16,226 --> 00:33:17,990
I don't remember her name.

565
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:18,995
Madou.

566
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,656
Oh, yes, yes. Joan Madou.

567
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,564
I don't think it's her real name.

568
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:23,829
Why don't you think so?

569
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,735
She registered as an actress.

570
00:33:25,806 --> 00:33:29,264
Oh. I knew an actor
who called himself Gustav Schmidt.

571
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:33,336
His real name was Alexander Maria,
Count of Zambona.

572
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:34,972
Nowadays, so many things happen.

573
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,449
Mmm, so much does not
actually happen.

574
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,384
Thanks, but for me, it's enough.

575
00:33:39,455 --> 00:33:41,685
For me, too. 27, you said.

576
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:42,816
Yes, sir.

577
00:33:45,095 --> 00:33:46,188
Come in.

578
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:50,358
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

579
00:33:50,435 --> 00:33:51,992
No. Please come in.

580
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,201
Won't you sit down?

581
00:33:56,942 --> 00:33:59,741
Was this here when you moved in?

582
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:01,677
I had it put there.

583
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,376
I hate a bed...

584
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,418
in the daytime.

585
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,416
Were you going out?

586
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,053
Later.

587
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,223
Nowhere in particular.

588
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:20,065
I don't know anyone
except the proprietor, the waiter,

589
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,129
the chambermaid, and you.

590
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:26,476
It's time you got out of here. Come.

591
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,037
We'll have something to eat.

592
00:34:30,816 --> 00:34:32,784
It's good to sit this way.

593
00:34:33,852 --> 00:34:37,254
You came to me out of pity,
but it means a great deal to me.

594
00:34:37,323 --> 00:34:39,315
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

595
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,421
No. Not yet.

596
00:34:44,166 --> 00:34:47,364
Well, the porter told me
that you were an actress

597
00:34:47,437 --> 00:34:48,926
when I asked for your name.

598
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,273
You had forgotten it.

599
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:55,273
Yes. Well, no.

600
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,041
Uh, I'd left the slip of paper in my hotel.

601
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:00,209
You remember it now?

602
00:35:00,285 --> 00:35:02,276
Yes. Joan. Joan Madou.

603
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:07,755
I'm not a good actress.
I've only played small parts.

604
00:35:08,861 --> 00:35:10,294
In Italy.

605
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:11,421
Are you Italian?

606
00:35:12,532 --> 00:35:14,797
My mother is Italian.
My father was Romanian.

607
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,838
My mother is still in Italy, I think.

608
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:21,467
Have you done anything else
besides small parts?

609
00:35:21,543 --> 00:35:22,704
Some singing.

610
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,244
Do you speak any Russian?

611
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:28,751
No, but I sing in Russian.
Gypsy songs.

612
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:30,480
It might be easier.

613
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,454
I know someone who may help you.

614
00:35:32,523 --> 00:35:33,455
Who?

615
00:35:33,524 --> 00:35:35,459
Someone very important.

616
00:35:35,527 --> 00:35:37,654
Colonel Boris Morosov.

617
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:39,789
He's a doorman at the Sheherazade.

618
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,062
Some doormen can do a lot.

619
00:35:56,986 --> 00:35:59,785
Come out of that rain
and kiss me, you doter.

620
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,066
Doctor, I'm surprised to see you here.

621
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,395
I forced him, Boris.

622
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,630
This is my first night back in Paris.

623
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,569
Thank the stars I'm with you again.

624
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,836
Katya, you have a Russian soul!

625
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,573
Why did you have to be born
in that Boston?

626
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,207
Nature went mad that day, Boris.

627
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,353
You have not been around
since you sent me

628
00:36:27,422 --> 00:36:28,787
this Joan Madou. Why?

629
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:30,256
What is the matter with her?

630
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:32,317
She's alone and hates it.

631
00:36:32,395 --> 00:36:34,795
I'm alone, and I intend to stay that way.

632
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,468
What's the matter, Ravic?

633
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,704
Do you know that woman?

634
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:37,771
No.

635
00:40:01,077 --> 00:40:02,009
Good evening.

636
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,010
You're alone.

637
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:04,172
Yes.

638
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:06,443
Oh, please. Do sit down.

639
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:09,011
I'll do it.

640
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:10,884
Uh, bring another glass, please.

641
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:16,858
This is vodka.
I don't know if you drink it.

642
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,864
We drank it at the Belle Aurore.

643
00:40:19,933 --> 00:40:21,094
That's right.

644
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,049
I haven't heard that for a long time.

645
00:40:43,294 --> 00:40:45,388
Well, shall we go on with this, or...

646
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:49,031
- What was it we drank?
- When?

647
00:40:49,102 --> 00:40:52,037
The first night.
It was the warmest thing I've ever had.

648
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,733
Where did we drink it?

649
00:40:53,808 --> 00:40:55,741
In that little bistro near the Arch.

650
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,937
Where the waiter had a woman
tattooed on his arm.

651
00:40:58,012 --> 00:41:00,743
Oh. Now I know.
It must have been Calvados.

652
00:41:00,816 --> 00:41:02,249
Apple brandy from Normandy.

653
00:41:02,317 --> 00:41:05,344
Uh, waiter, have you Calvados?

654
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,218
Uh... no. Sorry.

655
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,952
No one ever ask for it.

656
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,186
You see?

657
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,422
This place is too elegant.

658
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:17,560
Well, the simplest thing would be
to go to that other place again.

659
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,367
I'm through for the evening.

660
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,736
Fine.

661
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:26,111
Waiter.

662
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,612
Check, please.

663
00:41:27,681 --> 00:41:28,706
Thank you.

664
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,453
- Flowers?
- No, thank you.

665
00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:35,284
Cab, monsieur?

666
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:37,484
- If you please, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:41:41,364 --> 00:41:43,025
Mother? Roses.

668
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,341
Tonight I love you.

669
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:51,603
Thank you, Colonel.

670
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,444
What's the joke?

671
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:56,140
The joke, my boy,

672
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:58,342
is that man is great in his intentions

673
00:41:58,418 --> 00:42:00,249
but weak in carrying them out.

674
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,755
Therein lies our misery
and our charm.

675
00:42:02,823 --> 00:42:04,883
God bless your eyes.

676
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,757
- Good night.
- Good night.

677
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:07,886
Drive on.

678
00:42:09,732 --> 00:42:11,164
That's it.

679
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:13,326
That's where you sat the last time.

680
00:42:13,402 --> 00:42:14,664
You still remember?

681
00:42:14,737 --> 00:42:16,830
Perfectly. I never forget anything.

682
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:18,340
Do you remember what we drank?

683
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:19,340
Calvados.

684
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:21,435
Right. We'd like to repeat it now.

685
00:42:23,414 --> 00:42:25,406
We'll see if it has the same taste.

686
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:28,675
Double.

687
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,745
You ordered double Calvados then.

688
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:35,690
You know, you're gradually
giving me an uneasy feeling.

689
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:37,526
Do you remember
how we were dressed?

690
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,725
Raincoats.
The lady wore a basque beret.

691
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,598
It's a pity you have to be here.

692
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,670
You belong in vaudeville.

693
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:44,605
I used to be. Circus.

694
00:42:44,673 --> 00:42:46,107
I told you before.

695
00:42:49,779 --> 00:42:51,872
This gentleman has a bad memory.

696
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:55,977
He's an expert at forgetting,
just as you're an expert at not forgetting.

697
00:42:56,987 --> 00:42:58,785
Perhaps not, after all.

698
00:43:07,968 --> 00:43:09,230
Does it taste as good?

699
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:12,627
Better.

700
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:17,300
Want another?

701
00:43:19,481 --> 00:43:20,812
Would you like to leave?

702
00:43:26,924 --> 00:43:28,050
Waiter.

703
00:43:31,162 --> 00:43:32,925
These are what you had the last time.

704
00:43:32,997 --> 00:43:33,987
Are they?

705
00:43:34,066 --> 00:43:36,933
Yes, he's right. Laurents, Green.

706
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:40,939
You see? The lady has
a better memory than you have, sir.

707
00:43:41,007 --> 00:43:42,498
That's yet to be proven.

708
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:47,306
- Thank you.
- Good night.

709
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:48,370
Good night.

710
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:54,553
I'll take you to your hotel.

711
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:58,956
Taxi.

712
00:44:27,562 --> 00:44:29,393
I'm afraid the gentleman was right...

713
00:44:29,464 --> 00:44:30,898
about memory, I mean.

714
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:34,035
Here.

715
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,093
Thank you.

716
00:44:43,082 --> 00:44:44,743
Oh, Dr. Gunther.

717
00:44:46,152 --> 00:44:48,518
Alvarez. Jaime Alvarez.

718
00:44:48,587 --> 00:44:49,953
Don't you remember?

719
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,758
Remember now?

720
00:44:59,802 --> 00:45:01,531
On a kitchen table.

721
00:45:01,603 --> 00:45:04,538
A temporary field hospital.

722
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:05,868
At Aranjuez.

723
00:45:05,942 --> 00:45:07,967
A little white cottage in an almond grove.

724
00:45:08,044 --> 00:45:10,036
Yes, yes, I remember.

725
00:45:11,081 --> 00:45:13,709
Oh, Alvarez, this is Miss Madou.

726
00:45:16,421 --> 00:45:18,447
How is the leg now?

727
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:20,048
I can bend it completely.

728
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:22,027
It was good enough
to take me over the Pyrenees.

729
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:25,990
- It's all right.
- It's all over now.

730
00:45:26,066 --> 00:45:28,557
Those of us who can are getting out.

731
00:45:28,635 --> 00:45:30,103
- You're lucky to be here.
- Yes.

732
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:31,695
- Where are you staying?
- Here.

733
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,709
Beds, Doctor. Real beds.

734
00:45:34,777 --> 00:45:38,214
It's a nice hotel.
Just got in this morning.

735
00:45:39,549 --> 00:45:40,846
How are things here?

736
00:45:40,917 --> 00:45:44,478
Oh, fine. The frontiers
are guarded by mere words.

737
00:45:44,554 --> 00:45:46,386
The enemy will never break through.

738
00:45:46,457 --> 00:45:48,186
- Same all over again.
- Maybe.

739
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,692
Would you like a drink?

740
00:45:50,762 --> 00:45:53,890
Not now. There are things I have to do.

741
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:56,333
But we'll meet again.

742
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:06,838
You've hardly said a word
since we left the hotel.

743
00:46:06,915 --> 00:46:08,849
Is it because of that man?

744
00:46:13,422 --> 00:46:14,788
He called you Gunther.

745
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,826
- Yes, I know.
- Why did he do that?

746
00:46:16,894 --> 00:46:18,122
Is your name Gunther?

747
00:46:18,195 --> 00:46:19,959
My name is Ravic.

748
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:21,157
But he knew you.

749
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,564
Joan, names are unimportant.

750
00:46:23,635 --> 00:46:26,331
Never bother yourself about names.

751
00:46:28,574 --> 00:46:29,871
What's the matter?

752
00:46:29,942 --> 00:46:33,777
Nothing. I'm happy.
I told you I'm in love.

753
00:46:35,716 --> 00:46:37,445
Have you been happy often?

754
00:46:38,887 --> 00:46:41,047
Have you?

755
00:46:41,122 --> 00:46:42,419
Not often.

756
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,686
When was the last time?

757
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,523
Why do you ask me?

758
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,587
Oh, just to ask something.

759
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,529
Two years ago.

760
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:55,896
It didn't last long.

761
00:46:55,974 --> 00:46:57,839
Why not?

762
00:46:57,909 --> 00:46:59,070
He made terrible scenes.

763
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:00,907
He didn't understand
I no longer loved him.

764
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,606
One never understands that.

765
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:08,121
You would understand.
But then I would always love you.

766
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:11,090
You're different.
Everything with us is different.

767
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:14,128
He wanted to kill me.

768
00:47:14,195 --> 00:47:16,027
They always talk about it,
but they never do.

769
00:47:19,335 --> 00:47:21,530
You wouldn't want to kill me.

770
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,066
Your conversation
is becoming more human.

771
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:26,905
For a moment,
I was pretty frightened.

772
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,673
Because I love you?

773
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,408
Oh, we won't start that again.

774
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:34,350
We won't start what again?

775
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,781
Has anyone you loved ever told you

776
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:37,016
that he no longer loved you?

777
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:40,557
Yes.

778
00:47:40,626 --> 00:47:42,116
What did you do?

779
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:45,222
Everything, but it didn't help.

780
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:48,133
- I was terribly unhappy.
- For long?

781
00:47:48,203 --> 00:47:50,694
A week. About a week.

782
00:47:50,772 --> 00:47:52,764
That's not very long.

783
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:54,522
It's an eternity if you're really unhappy.

784
00:47:54,543 --> 00:47:57,944
I was so filled with unhappiness
that nothing else existed.

785
00:47:58,014 --> 00:48:00,745
And, if nothing else exists,

786
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,876
there is nothing left
with which to compare it.

787
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:07,625
All one can do is to start to live again.

788
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:12,491
What are you thinking of?

789
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:14,829
Of how dangerous you are, Joan.

790
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:17,461
I'm not dangerous.

791
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:20,268
The fact that you think that is part of it.

792
00:48:26,415 --> 00:48:28,407
- You must be tired.
- No, I'm not tired.

793
00:48:28,484 --> 00:48:30,384
- Been walking for miles.
- You didn't answer my question.

794
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:32,217
What did you do in Spain?

795
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:34,382
- Cut off legs.
- That's no answer.

796
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,948
What kind of an answer do you want?

797
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:38,824
- A true one.
- I gave you a true one.

798
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:40,455
Something in you is closed, Ravic,

799
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:42,227
and you won't let anyone or anything in.

800
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,201
You're imagining things,
and I need a drink.

801
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,965
Let's sit here.

802
00:48:51,779 --> 00:48:52,837
- Good evening.
- Coffee.

803
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:55,279
- Coffee and brandy.
- Very good, sir.

804
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,577
You drink too much.

805
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:57,948
Possibly.

806
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:03,487
Ravic, I'm in love.
I throw myself into it without a thought.

807
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,084
I love you and I'm happy.

808
00:49:05,161 --> 00:49:06,150
I'm never cautious.

809
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:08,494
I'm never afraid of...
of saying what I feel.

810
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:09,931
But you put up a barrier.

811
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,196
There's something in you that resists.

812
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,908
What is it?

813
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,976
Ravic!

814
00:49:45,476 --> 00:49:48,037
Ravic? Ravic, what is it?
You must tell me.

815
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:49,603
I'm sorry, Joan. I'll get you a cab.

816
00:49:49,681 --> 00:49:51,741
I have something to do here.
Please go home.

817
00:49:51,818 --> 00:49:52,807
Taxi!

818
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:54,147
- Will I see you later tonight?
- No.

819
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:56,882
Perhaps not for a few days.

820
00:49:56,956 --> 00:49:59,447
But why, Ravic?
You must tell me why.

821
00:49:59,526 --> 00:50:01,825
I can't talk about it.

822
00:50:03,063 --> 00:50:03,996
All right.

823
00:50:04,065 --> 00:50:06,659
Please, don't be angry with me.

824
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:11,270
How could I ever be angry with you?

825
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,145
Hotel de Milan.

826
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:37,363
- Hakke?
- Yes. I lost him.

827
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:40,135
On the corner of Avenue Georges V
and Champs-Elysées.

828
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:45,512
So. So the chances of meeting him
are not everywhere the same.

829
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:47,311
I intend to look everywhere.

830
00:50:48,586 --> 00:50:51,713
Hey. Ravic, hey.

831
00:50:51,788 --> 00:50:54,849
If you are destined to meet this man,
you will meet him.

832
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,291
Keep your eyes open everywhere.

833
00:50:56,361 --> 00:50:58,761
Be prepared for anything.

834
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:01,265
But otherwise,
go on living as if you're mistaken,

835
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:02,665
or you'll drive yourself crazy.

836
00:51:02,735 --> 00:51:04,533
Thank you, Boris.

837
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:06,470
No, no, no.

838
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,567
Don't take the gun.
You'll get only trouble.

839
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:12,579
Don't run any risks.
Don't be hero for nothing.

840
00:51:12,647 --> 00:51:16,277
Hey! You must go, eh?

841
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:17,341
Yes.

842
00:51:19,488 --> 00:51:23,858
Don't shoot unless you are sure
you can escape, eh?

843
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:25,623
This is your chance.

844
00:51:25,696 --> 00:51:27,027
Don't worry.

845
00:51:27,098 --> 00:51:28,726
Oh, Boris, please. Put out the light.

846
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,027
Oh. Yes.

847
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:10,778
Good morning, Mr. Ravic.

848
00:52:14,754 --> 00:52:16,655
Miss Madou didn't go to work tonight.

849
00:52:16,724 --> 00:52:18,316
She's been in all evening.

850
00:52:18,392 --> 00:52:20,953
She's paying extra
for burning her lights all night.

851
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:23,759
Can't sleep in a dark room, she says.

852
00:52:23,832 --> 00:52:26,165
Thank you.

853
00:53:01,544 --> 00:53:03,102
You came back because of me.

854
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:05,239
Yes, Joan, because of you.
Only because of you.

855
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,451
I don't ask anything more.
Only that you love me.

856
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,387
I do. Without love, a man is dead.

857
00:53:12,456 --> 00:53:15,255
- I love you!
- A dead man on a furlough.

858
00:53:15,327 --> 00:53:17,796
Don't leave me again.

859
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:20,458
Love me, love me, love me.

860
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:27,501
Ravic, we've got to get out of this.

861
00:53:27,574 --> 00:53:29,042
We must get away from this hotel,

862
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,830
away from the nightclub,
away from the town.

863
00:53:30,845 --> 00:53:34,077
Yes, we'll go away, we'll go away,
where the sun is.

864
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,674
We'll wash the rain away.

865
00:53:35,751 --> 00:53:37,344
Wash the past, too.

866
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:39,252
To Cannes or Antibes.

867
00:53:39,322 --> 00:53:41,188
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

868
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,954
Then we'll go.

869
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:44,550
Have we any money?

870
00:53:44,628 --> 00:53:47,792
Some. But in two or three weeks,
we'll have enough.

871
00:53:47,865 --> 00:53:50,300
I have to open the stomach
of someone of importance.

872
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:52,496
He'll provide the rest of the money.

873
00:53:52,571 --> 00:53:55,166
We'll live, Ravic, we'll live!

874
00:53:55,241 --> 00:53:58,268
We'll live. Only time dies.

875
00:53:58,345 --> 00:54:00,472
Look, I haven't a thing to wear.

876
00:54:29,883 --> 00:54:31,475
I saw you come out of the water.

877
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:32,609
How could you?

878
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,052
Then I covered my eyes.

879
00:54:34,121 --> 00:54:37,455
It was like Venus rising from the sea.

880
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:39,221
I didn't want to be struck blind.

881
00:54:40,529 --> 00:54:42,360
Now I am blind.

882
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,763
Now I have my sight back.

883
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,098
- How was the water?
- Cold without you.

884
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:49,503
- But good?
- Yes, yes. Good.

885
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:58,040
How long can we stay?

886
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:01,085
We'll find out tonight at the casino.

887
00:55:01,152 --> 00:55:03,348
Have we been winning?

888
00:55:03,422 --> 00:55:04,753
Not enough.

889
00:55:04,824 --> 00:55:08,022
Oh, Ravic, I wish I could
have this life always.

890
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:10,758
- You find that superficial, don't you?
- No.

891
00:55:10,832 --> 00:55:14,769
It is superficial, but we've had
so little of that in our wretched lives.

892
00:55:14,837 --> 00:55:17,271
In a few days, we'll go
back to Paris, to...

893
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,137
to that nightclub where
nothing ever changes

894
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:22,201
and to life in a dirty hotel.

895
00:55:22,279 --> 00:55:25,248
It was dark before,
and it will be dark again.

896
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,520
Here comes Tinzy and Nugent.

897
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:31,920
Oh, they'll go away again.

898
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:33,925
We promised to go sailing with them.

899
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:35,961
Oh. Well, then. Go with them.

900
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:37,496
They're your friends.

901
00:55:37,564 --> 00:55:38,827
Not my friends. They're yours.

902
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:40,160
You've known them longer.

903
00:55:40,233 --> 00:55:42,065
- Ten minutes longer.
- Well, longer anyway.

904
00:55:42,136 --> 00:55:43,831
- All right.
- Never mind.

905
00:55:43,904 --> 00:55:47,238
Go if you want to.
Tell them I have to work.

906
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:48,799
You told them that yesterday.

907
00:55:48,877 --> 00:55:52,507
Why is that all women love
these idiotic conversations?

908
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,609
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I have no boat.

909
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,553
Life is short.
We're only here for a few days.

910
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:02,059
Why should I persuade you
to do what you'll do anyway?

911
00:56:02,126 --> 00:56:03,616
All right, you've persuaded me.

912
00:56:03,695 --> 00:56:06,324
Good. I'll stay on this rock.

913
00:56:06,398 --> 00:56:08,832
I'm beginning to feel like part of it.

914
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:11,837
You're not a rock.
You're a block of concrete.

915
00:56:14,475 --> 00:56:16,170
Alex!

916
00:56:37,301 --> 00:56:38,667
Monsieur is lucky.

917
00:56:39,738 --> 00:56:42,139
Where's the beautiful lady tonight?

918
00:56:42,208 --> 00:56:43,607
Tonight, the beautiful lady

919
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:46,042
is behaving like a beautiful lady.

920
00:56:48,148 --> 00:56:49,775
Do you feel lucky?

921
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:50,783
Do you?

922
00:56:50,852 --> 00:56:51,944
Not a chance.

923
00:56:56,791 --> 00:56:58,623
The beautiful lady is here.

924
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:12,575
23.

925
00:57:20,653 --> 00:57:21,745
5.

926
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:22,914
8.

927
00:57:39,409 --> 00:57:41,240
Will you please put that
on number 6 for me?

928
00:57:41,311 --> 00:57:42,677
- All right.
- Thank you.

929
00:57:44,182 --> 00:57:45,171
5.

930
00:57:52,692 --> 00:57:54,626
Ah, you are idiots.

931
00:57:54,694 --> 00:57:56,252
Choose your side, Joan.

932
00:58:15,886 --> 00:58:17,911
- Were you going to drive off without me?
- No.

933
00:58:17,988 --> 00:58:19,889
You were going to leave me behind
with those idiots.

934
00:58:19,958 --> 00:58:20,925
Where are you going?

935
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:22,425
Nowhere. Just for a drive.

936
00:58:22,494 --> 00:58:24,622
- I'll go with you.
- What about your idiots?

937
00:58:24,697 --> 00:58:27,258
- I told them you were waiting for me.
- Good. Get in.

938
00:58:28,502 --> 00:58:30,060
Better put this around you.

939
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,443
Must be the air.

940
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:51,024
Oh, don't be angry with me, Ravic.

941
00:58:51,096 --> 00:58:53,427
This is the first time
I've been on the Riviera.

942
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:57,025
First time. The first time.

943
00:58:57,102 --> 00:58:59,833
Oh, forget what happened today.
Don't think about it.

944
00:58:59,906 --> 00:59:02,101
You're a wonderful driver, Ravic.
You know that?

945
00:59:02,175 --> 00:59:04,576
Those idiots were saying the same thing.

946
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:06,135
You're uncanny. You have no past.

947
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,306
Nobody knows anything about you.

948
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:08,610
I know a hundred times more

949
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:11,709
about the life of those idiots
than I know about yours.

950
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:19,951
Too fast?

951
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,554
No. Drive fast.

952
00:59:21,631 --> 00:59:23,566
I love you, Ravic.

953
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,727
Let's never go back to Paris.

954
00:59:25,803 --> 00:59:28,830
Let's steal a trunk
full of jewels or rob a bank,

955
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:31,398
take this car, and never come back.

956
00:59:31,476 --> 00:59:32,909
Careful.

957
00:59:32,978 --> 00:59:35,243
If you want that Calvados,
you'd better let me drive.

958
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:38,041
That's fine.

959
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:45,687
Come. We'll get your Calvados here.

960
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:49,486
Two Calvados.

961
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:54,226
How much have you had already?

962
00:59:59,176 --> 01:00:01,077
How much have you had to drink?

963
01:00:02,313 --> 01:00:04,282
Too much.

964
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,910
Too much because of you,
because I was away from you.

965
01:00:06,986 --> 01:00:09,454
- Then why didn't you come to me?
- I did come to you.

966
01:00:09,521 --> 01:00:11,182
Yes, when you saw me leave.

967
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,352
Did you win?

968
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,125
Yes.

969
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,132
Then let's go to the most
expensive restaurant

970
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,600
and have caviar and champagne.

971
01:00:22,404 --> 01:00:24,669
Let's be like our parents were
before all these wars...

972
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:26,732
carefree and sentimental and without fear.

973
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:29,607
Full of bad taste and tears,

974
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:32,274
and the moon, oleanders, violins,

975
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:34,909
and the ocean and love.

976
01:00:34,985 --> 01:00:36,666
I want to believe that I'm married to you,

977
01:00:36,688 --> 01:00:39,658
that we have children
and a garden and a house.

978
01:00:39,725 --> 01:00:41,989
I've given up a great career for your sake.

979
01:00:43,229 --> 01:00:45,323
And we still love each other...

980
01:00:45,399 --> 01:00:47,229
after 20 years.

981
01:00:48,335 --> 01:00:50,394
And you still think me beautiful.

982
01:00:51,571 --> 01:00:52,664
And I can't sleep

983
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,038
when you're not at home for one night.

984
01:00:56,745 --> 01:00:58,975
That's all part of it...

985
01:00:59,048 --> 01:01:01,313
part of that bad taste.

986
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:07,921
There is no use in our planning, Joan.

987
01:01:10,594 --> 01:01:11,526
I know.

988
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:14,190
No. No, you don't know.

989
01:01:14,266 --> 01:01:15,290
It's not what you think.

990
01:01:15,367 --> 01:01:17,700
It's something I should
have told you before.

991
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,862
I can't marry you.

992
01:01:18,938 --> 01:01:20,463
I'm a refugee without a passport,

993
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:22,031
and I can't get one.

994
01:01:22,109 --> 01:01:24,374
I have no proof of my identity.

995
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:26,345
I live illegally here.

996
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:28,382
On paper, I don't exist.

997
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,419
If they should catch me,
l... I'd be deported.

998
01:01:31,486 --> 01:01:34,320
Deported? Deported from France?

999
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,518
No, but, Ravic, Ravic, Ra...

1000
01:01:36,593 --> 01:01:38,584
I'd be back. I know the borders.

1001
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:39,754
It wouldn't be the first time.

1002
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:40,763
Nor the last.

1003
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:42,231
Oh, it isn't that bad.

1004
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,394
They haven't caught me in over a year.

1005
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,233
Oh, there is nothing
for us, Ravic, nothing.

1006
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:57,208
Tears solve nothing.

1007
01:01:57,284 --> 01:02:00,379
Look. Our Calvados is here. Come.

1008
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:04,887
What if I could close my eyes

1009
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,621
and... open them

1010
01:02:06,695 --> 01:02:09,756
and find all danger gone...

1011
01:02:09,832 --> 01:02:12,597
at last alone in the past?

1012
01:02:12,669 --> 01:02:14,603
All I can give you

1013
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:17,232
is my love in this bitter present.

1014
01:02:33,694 --> 01:02:35,025
To the present.

1015
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,841
It's a comfort to have you
back in Paris, Ravic.

1016
01:02:51,916 --> 01:02:56,149
It's good to be back and alive
and happy and working.

1017
01:02:56,221 --> 01:02:57,314
And well fed.

1018
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,482
Well, so long.

1019
01:02:58,558 --> 01:03:00,048
I'll come by this evening.

1020
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:29,156
I looked up and saw the cable snap.

1021
01:03:29,228 --> 01:03:31,526
He was riding a steel beam
and never had a chance.

1022
01:03:31,597 --> 01:03:34,465
Oh, no, no. Don't lift him.
Leave him where he is.

1023
01:03:34,534 --> 01:03:35,660
What are you, a doctor?

1024
01:03:35,735 --> 01:03:37,101
- Yes.
- All right.

1025
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,436
Unconscious, isn't he?

1026
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,205
Dead.

1027
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,613
But we've just been eating lunch together.

1028
01:03:48,684 --> 01:03:49,810
Somebody call an ambulance.

1029
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:51,080
The cable hit the woman.
She's bleeding.

1030
01:03:51,154 --> 01:03:52,086
- You.
- Where is she?

1031
01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:53,214
Over here, sir.

1032
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:01,462
Bring her over here.

1033
01:04:04,235 --> 01:04:05,294
Careful.

1034
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:20,252
Now, don't worry.
You'll be all right.

1035
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:22,722
Has anyone called for an ambulance?

1036
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,622
Here come the police.
They'll get one.

1037
01:04:24,693 --> 01:04:25,888
Well, I've got to go.

1038
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:27,156
Back, please.

1039
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:30,164
The woman is half dead,
and you want to leave?

1040
01:04:30,234 --> 01:04:31,428
Who put this bandage on?

1041
01:04:31,502 --> 01:04:32,993
He did. He says he's a doctor.

1042
01:04:33,071 --> 01:04:34,436
I've tied up the artery.

1043
01:04:34,506 --> 01:04:36,269
Better get her to a hospital fast.

1044
01:04:36,341 --> 01:04:38,332
Phone for the ambulance.

1045
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,851
One moment, Doctor.

1046
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:50,949
May I have your name?

1047
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:51,957
Police.

1048
01:04:52,026 --> 01:04:53,460
Woyczek.

1049
01:04:53,529 --> 01:04:54,461
You're a German.

1050
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:55,462
No, a Czech.

1051
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:56,759
I don't think you're a Czech.

1052
01:04:56,832 --> 01:04:58,674
- Listen, General...
- I think you're a German.

1053
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:01,067
Have you a license to practice here?

1054
01:05:01,137 --> 01:05:03,970
I don't practice here.
I'm a tourist. A Czech tourist.

1055
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,475
- May I?
- Certainly.

1056
01:05:06,544 --> 01:05:07,533
Hold it.

1057
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:10,682
- Have you a passport with you?
- Is that necessary?

1058
01:05:10,749 --> 01:05:12,614
- The gentleman's helped a woman.
- I'm interested.

1059
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:14,685
Have you a passport with you
or your identity card?

1060
01:05:14,754 --> 01:05:16,618
- No, not with me.
- Where is it?

1061
01:05:16,688 --> 01:05:18,884
At the consulate.
It has to be extended.

1062
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:20,152
Which consulate?

1063
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:21,990
The Czech Consulate.

1064
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:25,772
- All right, I'll call them up and ask.
- Of course.

1065
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:29,862
You won't mind staying here
until this is cleared up, Dr. Woyczek?

1066
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,730
You see that he does.

1067
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,846
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Never mind.

1068
01:05:37,914 --> 01:05:39,006
You must understand, sir.

1069
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:41,950
Fernand's father was hanged
by the Germans in the last war.

1070
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,920
That's why he's crazy on the subject.

1071
01:05:43,988 --> 01:05:46,184
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
If it was up to me...

1072
01:05:46,258 --> 01:05:47,850
I understand.

1073
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:51,590
Uh, may I use that telephone
before your friend returns?

1074
01:05:53,099 --> 01:05:54,863
Why, certainly.

1075
01:06:02,878 --> 01:06:03,867
Yeah.

1076
01:06:10,954 --> 01:06:12,387
All right.

1077
01:06:12,456 --> 01:06:13,651
All right, Monsieur Woyczek.

1078
01:06:20,598 --> 01:06:22,624
Of course I will remember.

1079
01:06:23,969 --> 01:06:25,596
So long, Woyczek.

1080
01:06:27,641 --> 01:06:30,907
The world should be
executed for murder.

1081
01:06:41,156 --> 01:06:42,146
Ravic.

1082
01:06:47,465 --> 01:06:48,454
Ravic?

1083
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:52,761
Arrested. They have arrested him.

1084
01:06:52,837 --> 01:06:54,203
When? Where? No!

1085
01:06:54,272 --> 01:06:55,261
Joan.

1086
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:01,271
Where did they take him?

1087
01:07:01,347 --> 01:07:03,043
We can bribe them.
We can get the money.

1088
01:07:03,117 --> 01:07:05,483
- You must not go to him, Joan.
- I must! I must! They will deport him.

1089
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:07,453
He said no one must go to him.

1090
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:10,856
All the police have now is a man
they have found in the street...

1091
01:07:10,926 --> 01:07:13,621
a face with no papers, no identity.

1092
01:07:13,695 --> 01:07:15,459
But I'll find some way of getting him out.

1093
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:17,761
They have to believe
whatever that face tells them.

1094
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:20,701
And since there is no proof
that he has been in France before,

1095
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:23,502
that means deportation
after two weeks in jail.

1096
01:07:23,574 --> 01:07:25,565
But I must... I must see him.
I must go to him.

1097
01:07:25,643 --> 01:07:27,305
There must be some way, somebody.
Where did they take him?

1098
01:07:27,379 --> 01:07:30,315
Joan, if you go to Ravic now,
you will open a door into his past.

1099
01:07:30,383 --> 01:07:32,179
I knew they would catch him! I knew it!

1100
01:07:32,251 --> 01:07:35,483
The minute the authorities find out
that he has been deported before...

1101
01:07:35,555 --> 01:07:38,525
not once, but many times...

1102
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:41,823
that means six months
in jail before deportation.

1103
01:07:41,896 --> 01:07:43,922
And then they'll catch him again
when he goes back,

1104
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,195
and I won't be able to live for fear of...

1105
01:07:49,906 --> 01:07:54,173
I wish I could say something
comforting, cheerful, pleasant.

1106
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:57,873
But history has no special
accommodations for lovers.

1107
01:08:00,585 --> 01:08:03,487
I'll do as he asks.
I won't go near him.

1108
01:08:03,556 --> 01:08:06,788
I'll stay here for the two weeks,
and then I'll go wherever he goes.

1109
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:11,354
It is possible to share
all of the happiness of someone else,

1110
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:14,868
but only so much of the despair.

1111
01:08:14,936 --> 01:08:18,030
Pity is a pleasure
for comfortable people only.

1112
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:21,473
It will not last long
in cold border towns,

1113
01:08:21,543 --> 01:08:25,036
filthy cellars, without money,
not enough food.

1114
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:27,379
Not one place where you can sleep safe.

1115
01:08:27,451 --> 01:08:32,013
And each day the struggle
for mere survival becomes worse.

1116
01:08:32,089 --> 01:08:34,080
- Each day...
- Spare me the rest.

1117
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:39,064
Tell me he'll be pushed
from prison to prison,

1118
01:08:39,131 --> 01:08:41,929
shoveled back and forth
over the borders like dirt.

1119
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:45,130
Tell me he'll be shot one day,
running like an animal,

1120
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:47,174
always running and no place to go to.

1121
01:08:47,242 --> 01:08:48,503
Damn it!

1122
01:08:48,575 --> 01:08:51,340
Go on, tell me that we're talking
about a dead man!

1123
01:08:56,218 --> 01:08:59,484
A refugee without passport

1124
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:02,754
has lost his membership
in the human race.

1125
01:09:02,827 --> 01:09:06,126
Those who remain alive must go on living.

1126
01:09:12,604 --> 01:09:14,595
I can't live like this.

1127
01:09:14,674 --> 01:09:18,576
I can't go back to one room
and four walls, alone.

1128
01:09:19,847 --> 01:09:22,611
And the darkness of night, and nothing...

1129
01:09:22,684 --> 01:09:24,276
I can't go back to that.

1130
01:09:24,352 --> 01:09:27,446
Alone, without hope.

1131
01:09:27,522 --> 01:09:28,784
Hope.

1132
01:09:28,857 --> 01:09:32,385
Hope is luxury we cannot afford this year.

1133
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:36,295
Why didn't he call me?

1134
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:37,628
He should have called me.

1135
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:39,226
He had only a minute.

1136
01:09:39,304 --> 01:09:40,566
And he called you?

1137
01:09:40,638 --> 01:09:45,042
Minute is too short to say good-bye
to somebody you love.

1138
01:09:48,047 --> 01:09:50,481
What did he say, for me?

1139
01:09:50,549 --> 01:09:52,142
Good-bye.

1140
01:09:52,218 --> 01:09:55,450
He said good-bye.

1141
01:09:55,523 --> 01:09:58,219
Didn't he ask me to wait?

1142
01:09:58,292 --> 01:10:00,727
He said good-bye.

1143
01:10:15,246 --> 01:10:17,237
What are those?

1144
01:10:21,988 --> 01:10:24,855
You and Ravic in Antibes.

1145
01:10:27,761 --> 01:10:29,752
Destroy them.

1146
01:11:15,217 --> 01:11:16,549
Good morning, Miss Madou.

1147
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:18,281
Morning, Albert.

1148
01:11:26,831 --> 01:11:29,494
Take some hot coffee.
You're soaked.

1149
01:11:36,277 --> 01:11:38,074
It's much too early for the mail.

1150
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:39,841
Yes, I know.

1151
01:11:39,915 --> 01:11:41,848
I promised I'd let you know at once

1152
01:11:41,916 --> 01:11:43,942
if a letter comes.

1153
01:11:44,019 --> 01:11:46,044
But it never comes, does it?

1154
01:11:46,121 --> 01:11:48,590
You've been doing this for months.

1155
01:11:48,658 --> 01:11:51,958
You ought to go back to work
instead of walking the city all night.

1156
01:11:52,029 --> 01:11:53,826
It's not right.

1157
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:56,128
Unwise, Albert.

1158
01:11:56,201 --> 01:11:58,135
Very unwise.

1159
01:11:58,203 --> 01:12:00,138
I don't just walk the city,

1160
01:12:00,206 --> 01:12:01,467
not always.

1161
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:03,507
Sometimes you go to the railroad stations.

1162
01:12:03,575 --> 01:12:04,736
Is that it?

1163
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:07,837
Yes, the stations.

1164
01:12:07,914 --> 01:12:10,474
Don't men molest you?

1165
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:13,213
They don't like women who aren't gay.

1166
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,811
Miss Madou,

1167
01:12:14,889 --> 01:12:17,984
why don't you put out your light
when you leave your room?

1168
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:19,322
It burns all night.

1169
01:12:19,394 --> 01:12:23,194
The bill runs up frightfully,
and your money won't last forever.

1170
01:12:23,265 --> 01:12:25,826
You're right, Albert.

1171
01:12:25,902 --> 01:12:27,267
Thank you for the coffee.

1172
01:12:27,337 --> 01:12:29,329
Oh, Miss Madou?

1173
01:12:29,406 --> 01:12:31,499
A man came to see you.

1174
01:12:31,575 --> 01:12:33,066
A man?

1175
01:12:33,145 --> 01:12:34,510
What man? Who?

1176
01:12:34,579 --> 01:12:36,844
I don't know.
I never saw him before.

1177
01:12:36,916 --> 01:12:39,543
What... What did he say?
What did he want?

1178
01:12:39,618 --> 01:12:41,519
He said he had to see you.

1179
01:12:41,587 --> 01:12:42,849
Where did he go?

1180
01:12:42,922 --> 01:12:45,414
He also said he was a
friend of Mr. Ravic's,

1181
01:12:45,492 --> 01:12:48,326
so I had him wait in your room.

1182
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,801
I would have found you sooner, Joan,

1183
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,572
if I had known where to look.

1184
01:13:04,115 --> 01:13:05,742
I'm going back to Antibes.

1185
01:13:05,883 --> 01:13:08,216
Will you come?

1186
01:13:44,663 --> 01:13:46,426
Ah, Monsieur Ravic.

1187
01:13:46,498 --> 01:13:48,524
I haven't seen you in some time.

1188
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:50,900
Woyczek.

1189
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:54,534
When did you get back?

1190
01:13:54,609 --> 01:13:55,939
This afternoon.

1191
01:13:56,009 --> 01:13:58,274
You stayed away more than three months.

1192
01:13:58,346 --> 01:13:59,608
It's getting harder.

1193
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,581
They watch the borders more closely.

1194
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,083
I was caught five times.

1195
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,279
Why did I not hear from you?

1196
01:14:05,355 --> 01:14:06,947
Letters never help.

1197
01:14:07,023 --> 01:14:09,117
Sit down, sit down.

1198
01:14:09,193 --> 01:14:10,990
- Have dinner.
- No, thank you.

1199
01:14:11,061 --> 01:14:13,792
Drink then. Hey.

1200
01:14:13,865 --> 01:14:15,798
Ah, Monsieur Ravic,
you haven't been here for long time.

1201
01:14:15,866 --> 01:14:16,856
How are you?

1202
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:18,027
What will it be, Colonel?

1203
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:18,899
Another bottle, another glass.

1204
01:14:18,970 --> 01:14:20,062
At your service, Colonel.

1205
01:14:20,138 --> 01:14:23,165
Monsieur Ravic.

1206
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:24,733
I thought your name was Woyczek.

1207
01:14:24,811 --> 01:14:27,371
It was. Sometimes Neumann.

1208
01:14:27,447 --> 01:14:28,915
Occasionally Gunter.

1209
01:14:28,983 --> 01:14:30,780
But I don't want to give up Ravic.

1210
01:14:30,852 --> 01:14:32,251
I like it as a name.

1211
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,686
You are back at the International, eh?

1212
01:14:33,756 --> 01:14:36,554
Yes, yes. Back in my old room.

1213
01:14:38,627 --> 01:14:39,958
Never seen this place so busy.

1214
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:42,260
Oh! People have gone crazy.

1215
01:14:42,332 --> 01:14:45,131
We could stay open 24 hours a day.

1216
01:14:45,202 --> 01:14:47,966
And mostly German tourists.

1217
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:49,337
They speak French very well.

1218
01:14:49,408 --> 01:14:52,810
Not at all the way the Germans
spoke it several years ago.

1219
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:54,345
Spend a lot of money, don't they?

1220
01:14:54,413 --> 01:14:57,008
They treat everybody
who will drink with them.

1221
01:14:57,083 --> 01:15:00,519
Strange, all those German tourists.

1222
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:03,420
With plenty of money,
and speaking good French.

1223
01:15:35,996 --> 01:15:37,430
Nice voice.

1224
01:15:37,498 --> 01:15:41,026
Ravic, you are talking to your father.

1225
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,196
Connoisseur of the human heart.

1226
01:15:43,271 --> 01:15:45,172
Do not make detours.
Ask me quickly.

1227
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:47,141
Let's get this behind us.

1228
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:49,611
- All right, where is she?
- She is not here.

1229
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:52,079
I have not heard anything
about her for several weeks.

1230
01:15:52,148 --> 01:15:53,616
And before that?

1231
01:15:53,684 --> 01:15:55,777
Before that, she inquired for you,

1232
01:15:55,853 --> 01:15:59,915
for some time, and then not anymore.

1233
01:15:59,991 --> 01:16:01,755
When did she leave her job here?

1234
01:16:01,827 --> 01:16:05,730
Not for some weeks after you left.

1235
01:16:05,799 --> 01:16:08,632
Do you know what she's doing now?

1236
01:16:08,702 --> 01:16:11,102
The last I heard of her,
she was in the south.

1237
01:16:12,272 --> 01:16:15,800
- Heard from whom?
- From the check room girl.

1238
01:16:15,877 --> 01:16:18,608
You want to see her, eh?

1239
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,705
- Yes.
- So.

1240
01:16:20,783 --> 01:16:24,618
If ever I open the door for her,
I will let you know.

1241
01:16:43,577 --> 01:16:45,671
- Well, is she still here?
- Yes.

1242
01:16:45,747 --> 01:16:49,547
Alone? My boy, a reigning queen
could not get in here alone.

1243
01:16:49,617 --> 01:16:51,551
Take care of this for me, will you?

1244
01:17:16,683 --> 01:17:18,015
What is it, darling?

1245
01:17:20,821 --> 01:17:21,811
Nothing.

1246
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:23,380
Let me go. I'll be right back.

1247
01:17:36,106 --> 01:17:37,130
Ravic...

1248
01:17:37,207 --> 01:17:38,698
Hello, Joan.

1249
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:42,413
You're back.

1250
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:43,914
How long have you been back?

1251
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:47,248
Two weeks.

1252
01:17:47,319 --> 01:17:48,752
Two weeks, and you didn't even...

1253
01:17:51,725 --> 01:17:53,956
No one knew where to find you.

1254
01:17:54,028 --> 01:17:55,791
Why did you never write?

1255
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:56,830
I couldn't.

1256
01:17:56,898 --> 01:17:57,866
That's a lie.

1257
01:17:57,933 --> 01:18:00,925
I didn't know whether I could...

1258
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:02,596
Come with me.

1259
01:18:07,177 --> 01:18:08,644
I didn't know whether
I could come back again.

1260
01:18:08,711 --> 01:18:10,145
You're lying. That's no reason.

1261
01:18:10,214 --> 01:18:11,295
You've been back two weeks,

1262
01:18:11,348 --> 01:18:12,872
and you haven't done
the least thing to find me.

1263
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,250
Joan, you didn't get that tan in Paris.

1264
01:18:16,321 --> 01:18:18,085
Well, I just came back from Antibes.

1265
01:18:19,959 --> 01:18:21,221
So I see.

1266
01:18:22,563 --> 01:18:24,497
Ravic, what are you doing here?

1267
01:18:24,565 --> 01:18:25,622
You must go...

1268
01:18:28,435 --> 01:18:30,165
You must go away.
They'll arrest you again.

1269
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,002
I know all about that now.
Next time, it'll be six months in prison.

1270
01:18:33,074 --> 01:18:34,508
That was bad luck.

1271
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:38,537
As a matter of fact, I hadn't thought
of looking for you in Antibes.

1272
01:18:40,951 --> 01:18:43,113
Whatever you're thinking isn't true.

1273
01:18:43,187 --> 01:18:45,848
Not true at all.

1274
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,823
Go back to your table, Joan.

1275
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:50,794
Your friends must be getting restless.

1276
01:18:52,598 --> 01:18:53,895
It's your fault.

1277
01:18:53,966 --> 01:18:55,730
Yours. Yours alone.

1278
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:20,360
All right. Turn on the light.

1279
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:25,526
Oh, Joan, please.
We're not playing hide-and-seek.

1280
01:19:25,603 --> 01:19:27,572
Did you know I would come?

1281
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,107
- No.
- Your door was open.

1282
01:19:30,209 --> 01:19:31,302
My door is often open.

1283
01:19:31,378 --> 01:19:33,505
I thought you wouldn't be here yet.

1284
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,606
I thought you would be
out drinking somewhere.

1285
01:19:38,085 --> 01:19:39,519
I was playing chess instead.

1286
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:40,714
What?

1287
01:19:40,789 --> 01:19:42,278
Chess.

1288
01:19:42,356 --> 01:19:43,824
With Morosov, downstairs.

1289
01:19:43,892 --> 01:19:46,691
Chess? But... You can play chess wh...

1290
01:19:46,763 --> 01:19:50,632
It worked. As a matter of fact,
I won a game.

1291
01:19:50,701 --> 01:19:52,221
You are the coldest, most unfeeling...

1292
01:19:52,236 --> 01:19:56,469
See? We've even built up
and etiquette for unhappiness.

1293
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,065
If you'd found me blind drunk,

1294
01:19:58,143 --> 01:20:00,442
everything would have been in good taste.

1295
01:20:00,513 --> 01:20:03,073
The fact that I played chess
and went to sleep

1296
01:20:03,149 --> 01:20:05,549
is proof that I am crude and unfeeling.

1297
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:09,721
That's good.
I couldn't stand that thing anyway.

1298
01:20:09,790 --> 01:20:12,760
But don't get splinters in your feet.

1299
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,735
Ravic, I'm sorry, but...

1300
01:20:19,803 --> 01:20:21,702
when I saw you tonight,
suddenly I couldn't think at all.

1301
01:20:21,770 --> 01:20:23,329
And when you left,
I thought you'd left for good.

1302
01:20:23,406 --> 01:20:24,236
I couldn't have endured it!

1303
01:20:24,307 --> 01:20:26,347
You can't leave me alone.
You're responsible for me.

1304
01:20:27,712 --> 01:20:29,646
Are you alone?

1305
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,417
You're responsible for me.

1306
01:20:33,485 --> 01:20:34,851
All right. All right.

1307
01:20:34,921 --> 01:20:38,482
I'm responsible for the occupation
of Czechoslovakia, too.

1308
01:20:38,558 --> 01:20:41,823
Now, stop it. It's getting light,
it's time for you to go.

1309
01:20:43,797 --> 01:20:45,822
You don't love me anymore.

1310
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:49,028
Oh, what idiots have you been with
the last three months?

1311
01:20:49,104 --> 01:20:50,571
What else could I have done?

1312
01:20:50,638 --> 01:20:52,470
Sit at the door to your hotel
and stare at the walls...

1313
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:55,010
No, no, no, no.
No confessions, please.

1314
01:20:55,078 --> 01:20:57,308
I don't want any confessions.

1315
01:20:58,648 --> 01:21:01,139
What I want to know is why you're here.

1316
01:21:03,921 --> 01:21:06,948
I'm here. Isn't that enough?

1317
01:21:09,795 --> 01:21:11,661
Yes. Yes, you're right.

1318
01:21:11,731 --> 01:21:12,789
It's enough.

1319
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:18,894
You say that, but first you have
to take away all the joy.

1320
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,044
What are you going to do?
Throw me out?

1321
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:44,328
We should have done this
long before now.

1322
01:21:44,403 --> 01:21:46,337
Yes.

1323
01:21:48,975 --> 01:21:51,034
Why don't you ask me, Ravic?

1324
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:56,207
About what happened in between.

1325
01:22:00,823 --> 01:22:03,691
Don't you want to know
where I live, how I live?

1326
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:06,251
Joan, look outside.

1327
01:22:06,329 --> 01:22:09,060
Ask the air whether it rained yesterday.

1328
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:12,535
Whether there was a war
in China or Spain.

1329
01:22:12,604 --> 01:22:16,540
Whether thousands are dying
or being born at this moment.

1330
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:19,202
The world exists. We exist.

1331
01:22:19,277 --> 01:22:21,940
Why rake up dead leaves?

1332
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:30,890
Did you miss me?

1333
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:34,896
- Yes.
- Much?

1334
01:22:34,964 --> 01:22:36,864
Yes.

1335
01:22:36,932 --> 01:22:39,925
I haven't heard that for a long time.

1336
01:22:40,003 --> 01:22:42,301
I'll drop you off at the hospital.

1337
01:22:51,751 --> 01:22:54,015
Flowers?

1338
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,551
- Why are they closed?
- They're having a party.

1339
01:22:57,624 --> 01:22:59,251
It's the captain's birthday.

1340
01:22:59,325 --> 01:23:00,623
No customers allowed.

1341
01:23:00,694 --> 01:23:02,252
Thank you.

1342
01:23:45,248 --> 01:23:47,307
Not so fast, my friends.

1343
01:23:47,383 --> 01:23:50,182
Give me a slower song, more romantic.

1344
01:23:50,254 --> 01:23:51,812
I've a long journey ahead.

1345
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:17,651
Have you heard from her?

1346
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,053
No. Not for three days.

1347
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:26,858
Hey! Sad songs are for customers!

1348
01:24:26,931 --> 01:24:30,026
Let us have some gaiety, eh?

1349
01:24:42,016 --> 01:24:45,350
I think we have had enough
of this party, don't you?

1350
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,717
Want to take walk?

1351
01:24:46,788 --> 01:24:49,383
No. Don't be so sentimental.

1352
01:24:49,458 --> 01:24:51,584
Might as well get used to it.

1353
01:25:07,913 --> 01:25:09,972
Ravic, come in.

1354
01:25:11,550 --> 01:25:13,485
It's good to have you here.

1355
01:25:17,391 --> 01:25:19,018
I've been waiting for you.

1356
01:25:19,093 --> 01:25:22,188
You didn't call me for days,
so I had to call you.

1357
01:25:22,264 --> 01:25:24,164
Come.

1358
01:25:24,232 --> 01:25:26,565
How do you like it?

1359
01:25:26,636 --> 01:25:29,161
It's nice.

1360
01:25:29,238 --> 01:25:31,433
Large and nice.

1361
01:25:32,576 --> 01:25:33,804
Do you know how it works?

1362
01:25:33,877 --> 01:25:35,367
- No.
- Oh, it's wonderful.

1363
01:25:35,446 --> 01:25:37,176
It plays for hours,
and I can lie here and listen

1364
01:25:37,248 --> 01:25:39,113
and watch it getting
dark outside and dream.

1365
01:25:39,184 --> 01:25:40,242
Do you like it?

1366
01:25:40,318 --> 01:25:42,344
Come, you haven't seen the rest yet.

1367
01:25:42,421 --> 01:25:44,583
One feels quite different
in an apartment.

1368
01:25:44,658 --> 01:25:47,956
Different than in those
dreary hotel rooms.

1369
01:25:48,027 --> 01:25:50,963
Yes, you're right.

1370
01:25:51,031 --> 01:25:55,901
Well, that's nice to have
had a look at all this.

1371
01:25:59,241 --> 01:26:01,335
Ravic, you're not going?

1372
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:05,409
Yes, Joan. For good.

1373
01:26:07,717 --> 01:26:09,015
What are you saying? Why?

1374
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:12,715
This whole place should tell you why.

1375
01:26:14,926 --> 01:26:16,918
Who's been talking to you,
telling you things? Morozov?

1376
01:26:16,996 --> 01:26:18,725
No one had to tell me anything.

1377
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:21,996
I know, because I have this apartment,

1378
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:23,764
because I don't work
at the Sheherazade any longer,

1379
01:26:23,837 --> 01:26:26,068
Morosov starts imagining things,
and you fall right in with him.

1380
01:26:26,141 --> 01:26:27,437
- Stop it.
- That a person can be somebody,

1381
01:26:27,508 --> 01:26:29,469
and make something out
of herself, that's a bit...

1382
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:31,342
Now stop your nonsense.

1383
01:26:35,184 --> 01:26:37,119
Are you going to beat me, too?

1384
01:26:37,187 --> 01:26:40,486
I just wanted to stop that babbling.

1385
01:26:40,557 --> 01:26:43,584
Do you think I'm calm just because
I came in here calmly?

1386
01:26:43,661 --> 01:26:46,562
What do you think I've been doing
for the past three days?

1387
01:26:46,631 --> 01:26:48,098
I've been waiting for you.

1388
01:26:48,166 --> 01:26:51,227
I didn't have your telephone number.
I didn't think I had to know it.

1389
01:26:51,303 --> 01:26:53,397
I didn't have your address.

1390
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:56,101
I didn't think I had to know that, either.

1391
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:58,202
For three and a half months
I didn't see you.

1392
01:26:58,279 --> 01:27:01,977
Well, I don't think
I missed you as much then

1393
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,076
as when you kept away
from me for one day.

1394
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:07,383
My thoughts were constantly on you

1395
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:09,720
in my room at the hospital,
everywhere.

1396
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:12,659
I sat with Morozov
and pictured you walking in.

1397
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:13,787
But you didn't come.

1398
01:27:13,864 --> 01:27:16,924
I stared at the phone until I could have
smashed it on the floor.

1399
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,798
But you didn't call.

1400
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:20,804
Then everything became clear to me.

1401
01:27:20,872 --> 01:27:23,103
I knew you wouldn't come,
only I hadn't wanted to believe it.

1402
01:27:23,175 --> 01:27:25,473
You had made sure of me,

1403
01:27:25,544 --> 01:27:27,944
then you could afford
to take your time.

1404
01:27:29,482 --> 01:27:32,645
There was someone else.

1405
01:27:32,719 --> 01:27:36,281
Not only someone else,
but another life, as well.

1406
01:27:37,492 --> 01:27:41,793
This life, that you want me to share.

1407
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:48,337
So, you'll break it off and go.

1408
01:27:48,404 --> 01:27:49,963
As simple as that.

1409
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,474
You didn't want to know anything,
and I loved you for it.

1410
01:27:52,543 --> 01:27:54,105
And now... now you come
and reproach me.

1411
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:56,637
What do you want of me, anyway?
What rights have you?

1412
01:27:56,715 --> 01:27:59,310
None. I thought you had come back.

1413
01:28:01,955 --> 01:28:04,479
Well, didn't I?

1414
01:28:04,557 --> 01:28:08,585
You came to me,
but you did not come back.

1415
01:28:08,662 --> 01:28:10,290
Ravic, listen to me.

1416
01:28:15,938 --> 01:28:18,999
While you were in Switzerland, I waited.

1417
01:28:19,075 --> 01:28:21,270
I waited, and there was nothing.

1418
01:28:24,481 --> 01:28:27,883
Then, one day, someone came...

1419
01:28:27,952 --> 01:28:30,444
who wanted me.

1420
01:28:30,522 --> 01:28:32,285
Nothing but me.

1421
01:28:32,357 --> 01:28:35,088
Wholly and forever.

1422
01:28:35,161 --> 01:28:37,186
It was like a landslide,

1423
01:28:37,263 --> 01:28:39,994
which one laughs at in the beginning.

1424
01:28:40,067 --> 01:28:42,035
Then, suddenly,

1425
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:45,071
there's nothing left to hold onto...

1426
01:28:45,139 --> 01:28:48,803
when one can't resist any longer.

1427
01:28:48,877 --> 01:28:50,539
Don't you understand?

1428
01:28:50,613 --> 01:28:52,080
Oh, yes.

1429
01:28:53,717 --> 01:28:55,480
I knew.

1430
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,985
I knew it.

1431
01:28:57,054 --> 01:28:59,250
It's quite easy to understand.

1432
01:29:01,191 --> 01:29:03,285
Beside you, he's nothing.

1433
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:06,464
I knew that the minute I saw you.

1434
01:29:08,434 --> 01:29:10,995
I know I must break with him, but...

1435
01:29:11,071 --> 01:29:13,699
I need time.

1436
01:29:13,773 --> 01:29:15,742
L... I can't do it right away.

1437
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,678
You see how generous he has been.

1438
01:29:18,747 --> 01:29:21,408
I didn't know if you
would ever come back.

1439
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:27,985
We were to be married.

1440
01:29:28,057 --> 01:29:29,854
Oh, Ravic, help me.

1441
01:29:29,927 --> 01:29:31,360
How can I help you?

1442
01:29:31,428 --> 01:29:32,656
By leaving you alone?

1443
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,926
No, I mustn't lose you!
I can't lose you!

1444
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,797
Then what do you want me to do?

1445
01:29:43,275 --> 01:29:45,641
Give me time.

1446
01:29:45,711 --> 01:29:47,976
Wait for me.

1447
01:29:48,048 --> 01:29:49,208
Wait for you?

1448
01:29:49,282 --> 01:29:51,012
Yes, wait for me.

1449
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:53,713
I'm a refugee.

1450
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:55,916
It's my profession to wait,

1451
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:58,482
to keep alive and wait.

1452
01:30:04,267 --> 01:30:05,894
You'll come again, Ravic?

1453
01:30:05,969 --> 01:30:07,631
Don't think about it.

1454
01:30:07,705 --> 01:30:09,400
Take your time.

1455
01:30:09,473 --> 01:30:11,465
You'll find out for yourself.

1456
01:31:38,646 --> 01:31:39,636
Good evening, sir.

1457
01:31:39,715 --> 01:31:43,117
Bring me hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of your driest wine.

1458
01:31:43,186 --> 01:31:45,518
- Yes, sir.
- Leave the menu.

1459
01:31:47,024 --> 01:31:48,514
Good evening, sir.

1460
01:31:48,592 --> 01:31:50,423
<i>Ja. Telephone this number.</i>

1461
01:31:50,494 --> 01:31:52,690
Ask for a Mr. Himmelstrutz.

1462
01:31:52,764 --> 01:31:54,628
- Give him this message.
- Yes, sir.

1463
01:31:54,698 --> 01:31:57,862
<i>And bring me a package
of Oziri zigarette.</i>

1464
01:31:57,936 --> 01:31:59,700
Gold tip.

1465
01:32:10,953 --> 01:32:13,045
Mr. Himmelstrutz, please.

1466
01:32:14,957 --> 01:32:16,549
Mr. Himmelstrutz?

1467
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,456
This is the chasseur at Fouquet's.

1468
01:32:18,527 --> 01:32:20,428
I have a message for you
from Mr. Haake.

1469
01:32:20,497 --> 01:32:22,397
Sorry. We have no Chesterfields.

1470
01:32:22,465 --> 01:32:24,627
Um, Laurents, Green.

1471
01:32:27,306 --> 01:32:31,175
A package of Oziri cigarette.
Gold tip.

1472
01:33:27,678 --> 01:33:28,610
Brandy, please.

1473
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:29,838
Yes, sir.

1474
01:33:36,388 --> 01:33:37,616
Ravic.

1475
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:41,289
Don't you recognize me anymore?

1476
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,157
How do you happen to be here?

1477
01:33:44,698 --> 01:33:46,563
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?

1478
01:33:46,633 --> 01:33:47,794
No. I'm waiting for someone.

1479
01:33:47,869 --> 01:33:49,358
You must leave me alone.

1480
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:53,302
Not until I've seen what she looks like.

1481
01:33:54,809 --> 01:33:56,471
Who?

1482
01:33:56,545 --> 01:33:58,672
The woman you're waiting for.

1483
01:34:01,551 --> 01:34:03,041
Don't do that.

1484
01:34:05,589 --> 01:34:06,613
Now I will wait.

1485
01:34:06,691 --> 01:34:08,659
Then sit somewhere else, please.

1486
01:34:12,464 --> 01:34:14,329
But why are you doing this, Ravic?

1487
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,027
You promised to wait for me.

1488
01:34:16,102 --> 01:34:19,162
You yourself said it would take time,
and it has only been two weeks.

1489
01:34:19,238 --> 01:34:21,207
Only two weeks.

1490
01:34:21,275 --> 01:34:22,674
Well, I didn't come here by accident.

1491
01:34:22,743 --> 01:34:24,609
I was looking for you.
Ravic, I must see you alone.

1492
01:34:24,679 --> 01:34:25,873
- No.
- It's important.

1493
01:34:25,947 --> 01:34:28,347
- I must talk to you.
- Don't be a child.

1494
01:34:32,555 --> 01:34:33,817
I'm going to leave him.

1495
01:34:33,889 --> 01:34:35,447
Yes, yes. You told me.

1496
01:34:35,524 --> 01:34:37,550
But I'm afraid.
He threatens me.

1497
01:34:37,627 --> 01:34:38,958
Hmm? What was that?

1498
01:34:39,029 --> 01:34:41,726
- He threatens me.
- Who?

1499
01:34:41,799 --> 01:34:44,098
Oh. Oh, I see.

1500
01:34:44,169 --> 01:34:46,069
I'm in danger.
He can be vicious, Ravic.

1501
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:47,764
Oh, you're not even listening to...

1502
01:34:49,575 --> 01:34:51,133
Wait. Just a moment.

1503
01:34:51,210 --> 01:34:52,143
- No.
- One second.

1504
01:34:52,212 --> 01:34:53,270
No.

1505
01:34:56,217 --> 01:34:57,206
Sorry I'm late.

1506
01:34:57,284 --> 01:34:59,252
Doesn't matter.
I'm going home.

1507
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:00,310
It was unavoidable.

1508
01:35:24,016 --> 01:35:25,608
Permit me, please.

1509
01:35:25,684 --> 01:35:28,711
Permit me, please.
There is no other table.

1510
01:35:28,789 --> 01:35:30,518
Sit down, please.

1511
01:35:46,276 --> 01:35:47,300
Good morning!

1512
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:02,619
I saw you while I was still inside.

1513
01:36:02,696 --> 01:36:04,391
I spotted you at once.

1514
01:36:06,233 --> 01:36:07,996
Oh, the scar.

1515
01:36:08,068 --> 01:36:09,900
It is a mark from a German student course.

1516
01:36:09,971 --> 01:36:13,669
So you are German
or so you have studied in Germany.

1517
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:17,842
Correct?

1518
01:36:17,914 --> 01:36:19,176
Correct.

1519
01:36:19,249 --> 01:36:22,413
It is my business
to know these things.

1520
01:36:22,487 --> 01:36:23,953
- Cognac.
- Yes, sir.

1521
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:27,013
That is one good thing
they have here, is cognac.

1522
01:36:27,091 --> 01:36:28,650
Otherwise, all is decadent.

1523
01:36:28,727 --> 01:36:34,360
These people here only wish for lazy life.

1524
01:36:34,434 --> 01:36:35,799
Do you live here?

1525
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:38,031
Yes.

1526
01:36:38,105 --> 01:36:39,367
Long time?

1527
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,499
Quite a while.

1528
01:36:43,277 --> 01:36:45,542
Permit me.

1529
01:36:45,614 --> 01:36:47,206
Ivon Haake.

1530
01:36:47,282 --> 01:36:48,214
Holn.

1531
01:36:48,283 --> 01:36:50,218
- Von Holn?
- Yes.

1532
01:36:54,491 --> 01:36:58,519
You must know Paris well.

1533
01:36:58,596 --> 01:37:00,461
Fairly well.

1534
01:37:00,532 --> 01:37:04,468
I do not mean the museums.

1535
01:37:04,536 --> 01:37:06,266
I know what you mean.

1536
01:37:07,806 --> 01:37:09,798
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1537
01:37:09,876 --> 01:37:11,002
I'll stick to this one.

1538
01:37:11,077 --> 01:37:12,339
So.

1539
01:37:20,822 --> 01:37:22,790
Chic.

1540
01:37:22,858 --> 01:37:25,760
These people here know all about that.

1541
01:37:25,828 --> 01:37:28,296
But these are nothing
compared to this woman

1542
01:37:28,364 --> 01:37:29,627
you were talking to now.

1543
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:31,224
You saw her?

1544
01:37:33,505 --> 01:37:35,268
Good acquaintance?

1545
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:36,705
Yes.

1546
01:37:36,775 --> 01:37:37,936
Just that.

1547
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:40,979
It is difficult here
to meet a woman like her.

1548
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:42,970
It can be arranged.

1549
01:37:44,116 --> 01:37:46,210
So.

1550
01:37:46,286 --> 01:37:47,776
This woman is French?

1551
01:37:47,854 --> 01:37:49,447
Italian.

1552
01:37:49,524 --> 01:37:52,789
With a few other races mixed in.

1553
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,489
Not bad.

1554
01:37:55,564 --> 01:37:58,090
Naturally, at home, we cannot have that.

1555
01:37:58,168 --> 01:37:59,099
But here...

1556
01:37:59,168 --> 01:38:01,694
Here you are a tourist.

1557
01:38:09,381 --> 01:38:10,973
You understand!

1558
01:38:12,217 --> 01:38:13,845
Thank you, Herr Haake.

1559
01:38:16,489 --> 01:38:18,650
Do you have, uh...

1560
01:38:18,725 --> 01:38:21,923
<i>much contact mit refugees?</i>

1561
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:25,331
Some.

1562
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:29,269
We appreciate you know
certain informations?

1563
01:38:29,338 --> 01:38:30,965
We even pay for this.

1564
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,407
Herr Ivon Haake,
you're not suggesting that...

1565
01:38:33,477 --> 01:38:35,775
Naturally, between men like you and me,

1566
01:38:35,846 --> 01:38:38,440
that is out of the question
unless it is a matter of honor.

1567
01:38:46,692 --> 01:38:48,626
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

1568
01:38:48,694 --> 01:38:50,629
No, no, no, no, no.
Allow me.

1569
01:38:50,697 --> 01:38:52,255
In Paris, you're my guest.

1570
01:38:52,332 --> 01:38:54,028
Ten francs.

1571
01:38:54,101 --> 01:38:55,432
- You must go?
- Thank you.

1572
01:38:55,503 --> 01:38:57,801
Well...

1573
01:38:57,872 --> 01:39:01,707
I thought I would
stroll about a bit tonight.

1574
01:39:01,777 --> 01:39:03,210
So?

1575
01:39:03,278 --> 01:39:04,540
You know.

1576
01:39:04,613 --> 01:39:08,641
There are things here for tourists
to see and learn.

1577
01:39:08,718 --> 01:39:11,313
Tonight. Oh, what a pity.

1578
01:39:11,388 --> 01:39:13,482
I must go to Berlin tonight.

1579
01:39:13,558 --> 01:39:15,458
I was just waiting here for two friends.

1580
01:39:15,527 --> 01:39:17,187
Our baggage is already at the station.

1581
01:39:17,261 --> 01:39:20,129
But maybe next time, huh?
I'll be back here in a few days.

1582
01:39:20,198 --> 01:39:22,326
I could call you up then.
Where do you live?

1583
01:39:22,401 --> 01:39:26,304
Uh, at the Prince de Galles,
just across the street.

1584
01:39:26,373 --> 01:39:28,136
Prince de Galles.

1585
01:39:36,317 --> 01:39:38,081
Are these your friends?

1586
01:39:40,322 --> 01:39:41,915
Just on time.

1587
01:39:41,991 --> 01:39:43,925
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Herr von Holn.</i>

1588
01:39:43,993 --> 01:39:46,758
I am delighted to have met you,
and you will hear from me

1589
01:39:46,831 --> 01:39:48,628
sometime between
the 28th and the 5th,

1590
01:39:48,699 --> 01:39:50,759
and discretion, of course.

1591
01:39:50,836 --> 01:39:51,768
Of course.

1592
01:39:51,837 --> 01:39:53,327
Between the 28th and the 5th.

1593
01:39:53,405 --> 01:39:54,430
Don't forget.

1594
01:39:54,506 --> 01:39:55,598
I never forget anything.

1595
01:39:55,674 --> 01:39:58,974
Neither an appointment or a face.

1596
01:39:59,045 --> 01:40:00,603
It's my profession.

1597
01:40:41,228 --> 01:40:42,662
Ravic.

1598
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:44,323
Come right away.

1599
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,163
Yes. No. Come right away, please.

1600
01:40:46,235 --> 01:40:47,566
L... I'm frightened.

1601
01:40:47,637 --> 01:40:50,505
Help me, Ravic.
Please come.

1602
01:40:50,574 --> 01:40:51,768
Yes.

1603
01:41:02,688 --> 01:41:03,677
Joan.

1604
01:41:08,195 --> 01:41:09,526
Joan.

1605
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:14,728
Oh, you're here.

1606
01:41:14,802 --> 01:41:15,826
What happened?

1607
01:41:15,903 --> 01:41:17,302
Nothing.

1608
01:41:17,371 --> 01:41:19,465
I'm glad you still have
enough concern for me

1609
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:21,031
to come when I call you.

1610
01:41:28,052 --> 01:41:29,849
So you lied to get me up here.

1611
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,445
Yes. I had to see you.

1612
01:41:33,624 --> 01:41:37,026
And if I have to lie to see you,
I'll continue to lie.

1613
01:41:38,865 --> 01:41:40,958
You acted very strangely at Fouquet's.

1614
01:41:41,033 --> 01:41:43,662
It was like telling me that everything
was over between us.

1615
01:41:43,737 --> 01:41:45,329
It is.

1616
01:41:50,879 --> 01:41:52,005
You needn't do that.

1617
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,207
I'm not going, not this time.

1618
01:41:54,282 --> 01:41:57,650
Not until I make you understand
that the book is closed.

1619
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,983
It is not closed.

1620
01:41:59,055 --> 01:42:01,319
I can't bring myself to marry Alex.

1621
01:42:01,391 --> 01:42:02,882
I love you.

1622
01:42:04,896 --> 01:42:07,764
And I'll always love you.

1623
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:09,595
And you love me.

1624
01:42:09,667 --> 01:42:11,431
Yes.

1625
01:42:11,503 --> 01:42:13,596
But I have broken away from you.

1626
01:42:15,842 --> 01:42:19,108
Are we automatons
that we can turn love on and off?

1627
01:42:19,179 --> 01:42:22,080
We were finished when I returned
from Switzerland.

1628
01:42:22,149 --> 01:42:24,118
I knew it then.
I should have broken off then.

1629
01:42:24,185 --> 01:42:28,145
I should have broken off
the first time you brought me here,

1630
01:42:28,224 --> 01:42:30,214
but I wasn't sure.

1631
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:31,760
No one can prophesy.

1632
01:42:33,095 --> 01:42:35,564
And sometimes one doesn't
want to know everything.

1633
01:42:56,557 --> 01:42:59,322
I can't imagine our never being together.

1634
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:05,428
For a time, yes, but not forever.

1635
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:07,696
You know you will leave me again...

1636
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,934
tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
sometime.

1637
01:43:16,314 --> 01:43:17,679
Yes.

1638
01:43:17,749 --> 01:43:19,445
And if you returned,

1639
01:43:19,518 --> 01:43:21,816
you know you would always go again.

1640
01:43:23,757 --> 01:43:25,156
Yes.

1641
01:43:26,859 --> 01:43:29,055
Yes, yes, yes!

1642
01:43:30,597 --> 01:43:32,589
Oh, what's the use?

1643
01:43:34,002 --> 01:43:37,439
What is it?
Why is it that way with us?

1644
01:43:37,506 --> 01:43:39,441
It's not only us.

1645
01:43:39,509 --> 01:43:43,173
Everyone searches for security in love.

1646
01:43:43,247 --> 01:43:46,443
You found them both,
but in two different men.

1647
01:43:46,516 --> 01:43:48,883
You want the one, and you don't
want to let the other go.

1648
01:43:48,953 --> 01:43:51,184
Yes, I would, Ravic.
I want only...

1649
01:43:51,256 --> 01:43:53,724
only I'm afraid.

1650
01:43:53,792 --> 01:43:56,626
I'd afraid of letting my love for you
do to me what it did...

1651
01:43:56,696 --> 01:43:58,994
what it did before,

1652
01:43:59,065 --> 01:44:01,762
when you were taken away from me,

1653
01:44:01,835 --> 01:44:03,667
when you were deported.

1654
01:44:05,806 --> 01:44:08,867
I can't, I can't be hurt like that again.

1655
01:44:15,752 --> 01:44:17,185
Can't we...

1656
01:44:17,254 --> 01:44:19,314
Can't we at least...

1657
01:44:19,390 --> 01:44:22,655
A former-Iover friendship? No.

1658
01:44:22,727 --> 01:44:26,094
Might be possible with some people.

1659
01:44:26,164 --> 01:44:29,259
A love like ours has no substitute.

1660
01:44:29,334 --> 01:44:32,304
Pain is part of it.

1661
01:44:32,372 --> 01:44:34,306
I can't.

1662
01:44:34,374 --> 01:44:35,842
I can't.

1663
01:44:35,910 --> 01:44:36,842
I can't.

1664
01:44:36,911 --> 01:44:38,139
I know.

1665
01:44:42,651 --> 01:44:44,619
That's why this is the end.

1666
01:44:56,067 --> 01:44:58,365
Ravic!

1667
01:45:15,824 --> 01:45:17,121
Hello.

1668
01:45:19,194 --> 01:45:20,423
Yes.

1669
01:45:20,497 --> 01:45:22,054
Yes, thank you.

1670
01:45:22,131 --> 01:45:23,861
I'm expecting him.

1671
01:45:42,288 --> 01:45:45,588
You certainly did not rent
one of the cheap suites.

1672
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:49,357
Have you ever sat in a plush hole
the entire day and waited?

1673
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:51,455
Longer, my boy, longer.

1674
01:45:51,533 --> 01:45:53,866
And remember, this is the first day only.

1675
01:45:53,936 --> 01:45:55,096
You may wait seven.

1676
01:45:55,171 --> 01:45:57,072
You may wait 7,000. Look.

1677
01:45:58,441 --> 01:46:01,410
France closed the German frontier today.

1678
01:46:03,915 --> 01:46:05,610
There's still a chance.

1679
01:46:05,683 --> 01:46:07,310
I'll wait the week out.

1680
01:46:07,385 --> 01:46:11,049
Did you have much trouble
getting in here without passport?

1681
01:46:11,123 --> 01:46:14,560
No. Night porters don't ask questions
in exclusive hotels.

1682
01:46:14,627 --> 01:46:16,220
What about the day fellows?

1683
01:46:16,297 --> 01:46:18,697
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1684
01:46:18,766 --> 01:46:21,462
If I had only thought
of asking Haake's Paris hotel.

1685
01:46:21,535 --> 01:46:23,332
I know. I know.

1686
01:46:23,404 --> 01:46:27,273
You are sitting here thinking
you have done everything wrong, eh?

1687
01:46:27,342 --> 01:46:28,833
- Forget it.
- Did you rent the car?

1688
01:46:28,911 --> 01:46:31,709
Oh, yes. Yes, Talbot with leather seats.

1689
01:46:31,781 --> 01:46:33,983
It's parked in the Rue de Berri,
opposite the Lancaster.

1690
01:46:33,984 --> 01:46:36,283
- Thank you.
- Remember, you have no license to drive.

1691
01:46:36,354 --> 01:46:38,617
That has never bothered me before.

1692
01:46:38,689 --> 01:46:43,684
I came here straight
from the International.

1693
01:46:43,761 --> 01:46:47,061
I left Joan in my room, crying.

1694
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:50,931
Hello.

1695
01:46:51,004 --> 01:46:52,233
One moment, please.

1696
01:46:52,306 --> 01:46:54,137
Do you know where
you'll want to take him?

1697
01:46:54,208 --> 01:46:55,641
Yes, I know a place.

1698
01:46:55,710 --> 01:46:57,042
Yes?

1699
01:46:57,112 --> 01:46:59,306
Yes, this is Herr von Holn.

1700
01:46:59,380 --> 01:47:02,544
The wine you ordered,
was it Liebfrauen '29?

1701
01:47:03,952 --> 01:47:06,012
Yes. Open.

1702
01:47:06,089 --> 01:47:07,954
Room service.

1703
01:47:08,024 --> 01:47:09,617
Yeah.

1704
01:47:11,028 --> 01:47:14,192
I hope you do not attract attention.

1705
01:47:14,266 --> 01:47:17,429
No man in Paris eats in his room
unless he is sick.

1706
01:47:20,171 --> 01:47:21,764
I wish I could come with you.

1707
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:24,470
I'm glad you don't have to.

1708
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,512
God bless your eyes.

1709
01:48:07,128 --> 01:48:08,721
They've invaded Poland.

1710
01:48:14,104 --> 01:48:15,593
Yes, it's started.

1711
01:48:15,671 --> 01:48:18,334
The whole city is deathly quiet.

1712
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:22,641
Whole country is hoping against hope.

1713
01:48:22,714 --> 01:48:26,276
And here I am playing
this silly game of Indians.

1714
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,754
If only Haake hasn't left Paris by now.

1715
01:48:31,825 --> 01:48:33,487
With the frontiers closed,

1716
01:48:33,561 --> 01:48:35,653
he may not even have come at all.

1717
01:48:35,729 --> 01:48:37,664
For four days now, I've...

1718
01:48:37,732 --> 01:48:41,499
Let's talk about something else.

1719
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:42,594
Yes.

1720
01:48:42,671 --> 01:48:46,768
What do you really intend
to do about Joan?

1721
01:48:47,977 --> 01:48:49,172
Have you seen her again?

1722
01:48:49,246 --> 01:48:51,874
Every day she comes
to see me at International,

1723
01:48:51,949 --> 01:48:54,383
every night at Sheherazade.

1724
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:57,114
She wants to make things right.

1725
01:48:57,188 --> 01:48:59,486
She is desperate.

1726
01:48:59,557 --> 01:49:01,423
Let's talk about something else.

1727
01:49:22,786 --> 01:49:24,014
We'll be blacked out.

1728
01:49:24,087 --> 01:49:27,216
It's just been announced over the radio
as a precaution against air raids.

1729
01:49:27,291 --> 01:49:29,658
On the radio, they say
everything is precaution.

1730
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,059
They say there will be no war.

1731
01:49:31,129 --> 01:49:33,096
They say they're about to negotiate.

1732
01:49:33,165 --> 01:49:34,359
- Good evening, Miss Madou.
- Good evening.

1733
01:49:34,433 --> 01:49:36,697
- I want to see the colonel.
- I'll look for him.

1734
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:39,700
Hey.

1735
01:49:39,772 --> 01:49:42,037
I cannot talk to her here in this uniform.

1736
01:49:42,109 --> 01:49:43,303
Tell her I see her outside.

1737
01:49:43,377 --> 01:49:44,571
You can talk to her here.

1738
01:49:44,645 --> 01:49:46,136
Not a soul will be here tonight.

1739
01:49:46,214 --> 01:49:47,203
Well...

1740
01:49:53,522 --> 01:49:55,456
- Please...
- There will be blackout any minute.

1741
01:49:55,524 --> 01:49:56,582
It was just announced.

1742
01:49:56,659 --> 01:49:57,957
- You're to hurry home.
- Please, Colonel...

1743
01:49:58,028 --> 01:49:59,188
You should not be out alone.

1744
01:49:59,262 --> 01:50:00,991
Where is he?

1745
01:50:01,064 --> 01:50:02,965
I do not know.

1746
01:50:03,034 --> 01:50:04,262
If they declare war,

1747
01:50:04,335 --> 01:50:06,270
they'll put Ravic
into a concentration camp.

1748
01:50:06,338 --> 01:50:08,932
You are the only one who can
give me a chance to see him.

1749
01:50:09,007 --> 01:50:10,998
Please, before it is too late.

1750
01:50:12,911 --> 01:50:14,436
All right, Joan.

1751
01:50:14,514 --> 01:50:15,640
If I see him.

1752
01:50:17,685 --> 01:50:18,845
I have your word?

1753
01:50:42,147 --> 01:50:44,308
Monsieur von Holn doesn't answer.

1754
01:50:44,383 --> 01:50:45,509
He must be in.

1755
01:50:45,585 --> 01:50:47,678
You'll keep ringing, please.

1756
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:02,898
Where are you going?

1757
01:51:02,972 --> 01:51:04,098
To get my car.

1758
01:51:04,173 --> 01:51:05,572
You want to leave me.

1759
01:51:05,642 --> 01:51:07,235
No, no, no, no, no.
You wait here.

1760
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,638
We closed up this place.

1761
01:51:10,714 --> 01:51:12,477
Wait here.

1762
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:28,596
Tell me about this place
where we are going.

1763
01:51:28,669 --> 01:51:32,902
Well, select wines, exquisite service,

1764
01:51:32,974 --> 01:51:35,375
unbelievably pleasant company...

1765
01:51:35,444 --> 01:51:37,844
Sounds wonderful, wonderful.

1766
01:51:39,015 --> 01:51:40,141
But not cheap.

1767
01:51:40,216 --> 01:51:43,243
We Germans, you know,
limited foreign exchange.

1768
01:51:43,321 --> 01:51:47,417
Herr Ivon Haake, need I remind you
that in Paris you're my guest?

1769
01:51:47,491 --> 01:51:51,053
You are a true landsman.

1770
01:51:56,903 --> 01:51:58,166
It is 5:30.

1771
01:51:58,238 --> 01:51:59,262
Remember, good friend,

1772
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:03,004
I must be in the
Gare du Nord by 9:00.

1773
01:52:03,078 --> 01:52:05,239
I will not see Paris again

1774
01:52:05,313 --> 01:52:10,411
until I, through this
Arch of Triumph, march.

1775
01:52:13,289 --> 01:52:15,485
We have nearly four hours.

1776
01:52:15,559 --> 01:52:17,925
You'll make it easily.

1777
01:52:50,467 --> 01:52:51,593
Where are we?

1778
01:52:51,669 --> 01:52:53,136
The Bois de Boulogne.

1779
01:52:53,203 --> 01:52:54,796
How long are we driving?

1780
01:52:54,873 --> 01:52:56,306
Oh, ten minutes.

1781
01:52:56,374 --> 01:52:57,841
It has been longer.

1782
01:52:57,909 --> 01:52:59,036
Not much.

1783
01:52:59,111 --> 01:53:00,791
Before I was asleep, I looked at the time.

1784
01:53:00,846 --> 01:53:02,405
We are driving more than half an hour.

1785
01:53:02,482 --> 01:53:05,006
Really? I didn't think it was so long.

1786
01:53:05,084 --> 01:53:06,073
We'll be there soon.

1787
01:53:06,152 --> 01:53:07,211
Where?

1788
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:09,448
The place I told you about.

1789
01:53:10,758 --> 01:53:12,350
Drive back.

1790
01:53:13,561 --> 01:53:15,223
<i>- Now?
- Ja.</i>

1791
01:53:17,266 --> 01:53:18,324
Why?

1792
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:19,868
Drive back.

1793
01:53:21,404 --> 01:53:22,632
All right.

1794
01:53:28,713 --> 01:53:30,476
Do we go back?

1795
01:53:30,548 --> 01:53:31,811
Yes.

1796
01:55:19,745 --> 01:55:21,440
10 Downing Street.

1797
01:55:21,514 --> 01:55:26,009
This morning, the British
Ambassador in Berlin

1798
01:55:26,086 --> 01:55:30,183
handed the German government a final note,

1799
01:55:30,258 --> 01:55:35,823
stating that unless we heard
from them by 11:00

1800
01:55:35,899 --> 01:55:38,093
that they were prepared at once

1801
01:55:38,167 --> 01:55:41,069
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1802
01:55:41,137 --> 01:55:45,575
a state of war would exist between us.

1803
01:55:45,643 --> 01:55:47,839
I have to tell you now

1804
01:55:47,913 --> 01:55:51,475
that no such undertaking
has been received,

1805
01:55:51,551 --> 01:55:53,576
and that consequently

1806
01:55:53,653 --> 01:55:57,521
this country is at war with Germany.

1807
01:56:03,197 --> 01:56:04,597
You heard?

1808
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:06,258
Well?

1809
01:56:06,334 --> 01:56:10,601
I killed him in the Bois
and buried him in Saint-Germain.

1810
01:56:10,673 --> 01:56:12,232
Where is the car?

1811
01:56:13,911 --> 01:56:16,072
Rue Poncelet.

1812
01:56:16,146 --> 01:56:17,545
Everything is in order.

1813
01:56:17,614 --> 01:56:19,548
Nothing else to do?

1814
01:56:19,617 --> 01:56:21,608
Nothing.

1815
01:56:21,686 --> 01:56:24,178
I've got an horrific headache.

1816
01:56:24,256 --> 01:56:26,554
I want to sleep.
I'll come down later.

1817
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:28,389
You did not forget anything?

1818
01:56:28,461 --> 01:56:30,486
No, I don't think so.

1819
01:56:30,563 --> 01:56:34,660
I've given up my room
at the Prince de Galles.

1820
01:56:34,735 --> 01:56:38,171
Madame Favier gave me
my old place here.

1821
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:40,265
I can't go over the whole thing now.

1822
01:56:40,342 --> 01:56:41,775
First, I must sleep.

1823
01:56:41,843 --> 01:56:44,677
Did he ever find out who you were?

1824
01:56:44,747 --> 01:56:48,411
He didn't know who or why.

1825
01:57:06,940 --> 01:57:08,636
Ravic?

1826
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:11,076
Hello? Ravic?

1827
01:57:11,145 --> 01:57:13,273
Answer me.

1828
01:57:13,349 --> 01:57:16,910
The colonel told me you're there.

1829
01:57:16,986 --> 01:57:19,716
I'm back at the Milan,

1830
01:57:19,788 --> 01:57:22,986
where you first brought me.

1831
01:57:23,059 --> 01:57:26,188
L... I've left him, Ravic,

1832
01:57:26,263 --> 01:57:29,427
and he's hurt me badly.

1833
01:57:29,501 --> 01:57:33,437
Come. Come quickly.

1834
01:57:33,505 --> 01:57:35,063
Quickly.

1835
01:57:39,946 --> 01:57:42,643
Dr. Ravic. Dr. Ravic.

1836
01:57:42,716 --> 01:57:44,309
Dr. Ravic, wake up.
You must wake up.

1837
01:57:44,386 --> 01:57:46,581
- Please do wake up.
- What do you want?

1838
01:57:46,654 --> 01:57:48,019
You must come immediately.

1839
01:57:48,089 --> 01:57:49,648
- It's Joan.
- What?

1840
01:57:49,725 --> 01:57:51,488
It was an accident.

1841
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:53,824
You can't put the light on.
There's a blackout.

1842
01:57:53,896 --> 01:57:56,695
If I have to put a light on,
I'll put a light on.

1843
01:57:56,767 --> 01:57:57,848
Have you a taxi downstairs?

1844
01:57:57,901 --> 01:57:59,732
I have my car.

1845
01:57:59,803 --> 01:58:01,101
I shot her.

1846
01:58:02,707 --> 01:58:05,142
I pleaded with her not to leave me.

1847
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:07,007
I only meant to threaten her.

1848
01:58:11,051 --> 01:58:12,313
What about the police?

1849
01:58:12,385 --> 01:58:13,682
No one heard me.

1850
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:15,983
- Get my case together.
- Yes.

1851
01:58:56,572 --> 01:58:58,597
How did you get on the bed?

1852
01:58:58,674 --> 01:59:01,803
Alex. I couldn't walk.

1853
01:59:01,878 --> 01:59:04,712
Just after I telephoned you, I couldn't...

1854
01:59:04,782 --> 01:59:07,649
I couldn't move my leg or my arm.

1855
01:59:07,718 --> 01:59:09,515
What is it, Ravic?

1856
01:59:11,021 --> 01:59:12,147
Are you in pain?

1857
01:59:12,223 --> 01:59:13,316
Yes.

1858
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:15,325
I'll give you something in a minute.

1859
01:59:19,165 --> 01:59:22,897
Call up Passy 2741.

1860
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:23,994
Order an ambulance.

1861
01:59:24,071 --> 01:59:25,266
Yes.

1862
01:59:27,308 --> 01:59:28,467
Hello.

1863
01:59:28,542 --> 01:59:31,410
Passy 2741.

1864
01:59:31,479 --> 01:59:33,744
What is it, Ravic?

1865
01:59:33,816 --> 01:59:35,340
Nothing bad.

1866
01:59:35,417 --> 01:59:37,249
Send an ambulance immediately.

1867
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,220
Hotel de Milan.

1868
01:59:39,289 --> 01:59:41,724
Rue Cardinal.

1869
01:59:41,792 --> 01:59:42,884
Room 8.

1870
01:59:47,465 --> 01:59:50,264
I don't want to be operated on.

1871
01:59:50,335 --> 01:59:52,496
Maybe we won't have to.

1872
01:59:54,574 --> 01:59:55,836
Is it serious?

1873
01:59:55,909 --> 01:59:58,538
No. Nothing serious.

1874
01:59:58,612 --> 02:00:00,671
They said the ambulance is coming.

1875
02:00:00,748 --> 02:00:03,616
Call up Auteuil 1357.

1876
02:00:03,685 --> 02:00:05,711
It's a hospital.
I'll talk to them.

1877
02:00:06,721 --> 02:00:08,245
1357.

1878
02:00:08,323 --> 02:00:09,450
Hello.

1879
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:13,555
Auteuil 1357.

1880
02:00:13,630 --> 02:00:15,222
Ravic.

1881
02:00:16,733 --> 02:00:18,326
I don't want...

1882
02:00:18,403 --> 02:00:20,064
I don't want to have pain.

1883
02:00:20,138 --> 02:00:21,367
You won't.

1884
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:24,341
I can't... I can't endure... I can't...

1885
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:26,571
Doctor, it's the hospital.

1886
02:00:26,645 --> 02:00:28,545
All right. I'll be right there.

1887
02:00:28,614 --> 02:00:30,776
Hold it for a second.

1888
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,899
All done.

1889
02:00:50,874 --> 02:00:52,273
Hello.

1890
02:00:52,343 --> 02:00:53,868
Hello, Geni?

1891
02:00:53,945 --> 02:00:56,175
Yes. Yes, a room.

1892
02:00:56,248 --> 02:00:58,809
And call up Veber.

1893
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:03,921
Yes. Yes, have everything ready.

1894
02:01:03,991 --> 02:01:05,288
All right.

1895
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:07,418
I've ordered an ambulance.

1896
02:01:09,096 --> 02:01:11,588
Yes. In ten minutes.

1897
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:14,101
Oh, darling, darling,

1898
02:01:14,169 --> 02:01:16,535
I don't know what happened.

1899
02:01:16,605 --> 02:01:17,834
I don't know what happened.

1900
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:30,518
I don't know...

1901
02:01:30,589 --> 02:01:31,954
Get up.

1902
02:01:35,194 --> 02:01:37,185
I didn't mean to do it.

1903
02:01:37,263 --> 02:01:38,925
Believe me, I didn't mean to do it.

1904
02:01:38,999 --> 02:01:40,990
Go down and wait for the ambulance.

1905
02:01:42,137 --> 02:01:43,330
Go on.

1906
02:01:53,316 --> 02:01:55,148
You'll help me.

1907
02:01:55,218 --> 02:01:57,779
Yes.

1908
02:01:57,855 --> 02:01:59,516
You're here.

1909
02:02:01,426 --> 02:02:06,262
I'm always at peace when I'm with you.

1910
02:02:42,908 --> 02:02:44,170
If you like, I'll call Baudet.

1911
02:02:44,243 --> 02:02:46,576
He could be here in 15 minutes.

1912
02:02:46,646 --> 02:02:49,342
You can assist him,
and he can do it.

1913
02:02:51,319 --> 02:02:53,879
No. No, it's too late.

1914
02:02:53,956 --> 02:02:55,389
I couldn't anyway.

1915
02:02:55,457 --> 02:02:57,721
Looking on would be worse.

1916
02:03:45,616 --> 02:03:47,710
Ravic.

1917
02:03:47,786 --> 02:03:48,980
Are you here?

1918
02:03:56,230 --> 02:03:57,594
Yes.

1919
02:03:57,664 --> 02:03:59,792
Did you operate?

1920
02:04:02,169 --> 02:04:04,229
No.

1921
02:04:04,306 --> 02:04:06,502
It wasn't necessary.

1922
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:15,685
Will you stay with me?

1923
02:04:15,753 --> 02:04:17,242
Yes.

1924
02:04:19,057 --> 02:04:21,252
Headache.

1925
02:04:21,326 --> 02:04:23,795
Oh, it feels like lead.

1926
02:04:23,863 --> 02:04:26,457
You'll be better soon.

1927
02:04:26,533 --> 02:04:29,468
Oh, it didn't ache so much before.

1928
02:04:29,536 --> 02:04:32,973
Oh, I don't want to suffer.

1929
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,134
Ravic, promise I won't suffer.

1930
02:04:37,912 --> 02:04:40,848
My grandmother. I saw her.

1931
02:04:42,584 --> 02:04:45,520
I don't want that. Promise.

1932
02:04:45,588 --> 02:04:47,386
I promise.

1933
02:04:51,696 --> 02:04:53,254
What's wrong with my arm?

1934
02:04:55,134 --> 02:04:56,430
It will come back again.

1935
02:04:56,501 --> 02:04:58,662
And my leg.

1936
02:04:58,738 --> 02:05:00,035
It's the same.

1937
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:08,310
Oh, I just intended to begin

1938
02:05:08,383 --> 02:05:11,148
to live differently.

1939
02:05:16,959 --> 02:05:19,929
What would have happened
without you?

1940
02:05:26,304 --> 02:05:28,569
Doctor, how is she?

1941
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:30,870
I'm going in and find out.

1942
02:05:38,685 --> 02:05:40,950
The one time when I'm most needed,

1943
02:05:41,021 --> 02:05:44,514
all that I know,
all that I've learned, is nothing.

1944
02:05:51,868 --> 02:05:54,529
Poor France.

1945
02:05:54,604 --> 02:05:58,041
Yes, poor France.

1946
02:05:58,108 --> 02:06:00,839
And I'm afraid it's more
than France, Veber.

1947
02:06:00,912 --> 02:06:02,971
For me, it's France.

1948
02:06:03,047 --> 02:06:04,037
Of course.

1949
02:06:13,827 --> 02:06:14,919
Ravic.

1950
02:06:14,995 --> 02:06:16,361
I'm here, Joan.

1951
02:06:20,402 --> 02:06:23,839
What's the matter with my legs?

1952
02:06:23,906 --> 02:06:26,397
I can't move either one of them anymore.

1953
02:06:27,945 --> 02:06:31,506
You'll be able to walk as always
as soon as you get up again.

1954
02:06:36,054 --> 02:06:38,113
You don't have to lie.

1955
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:42,892
You mustn't let me live

1956
02:06:42,962 --> 02:06:45,898
when I'm nothing but pain.

1957
02:06:45,966 --> 02:06:49,368
You must give me something strong,

1958
02:06:49,437 --> 02:06:52,463
strong enough for heaven.

1959
02:06:53,975 --> 02:06:55,671
You must do it,

1960
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:58,907
even if I don't want you to.

1961
02:07:00,316 --> 02:07:01,476
Promise.

1962
02:07:01,551 --> 02:07:03,178
Joan...

1963
02:07:06,023 --> 02:07:08,993
It's all right for you to do it.

1964
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:11,723
Without you,

1965
02:07:11,797 --> 02:07:13,992
I wouldn't be alive anyway.

1966
02:07:16,502 --> 02:07:18,936
You gave me this year.

1967
02:07:22,476 --> 02:07:26,937
Why didn't I stay with you?

1968
02:07:28,084 --> 02:07:30,074
It was my fault, Joan.

1969
02:07:30,151 --> 02:07:33,553
No.

1970
02:07:33,622 --> 02:07:36,615
It was... It was...

1971
02:07:36,693 --> 02:07:38,854
Oh, I don't know.

1972
02:07:38,929 --> 02:07:41,296
My head...

1973
02:07:41,365 --> 02:07:42,457
a light...

1974
02:07:42,533 --> 02:07:45,469
my eyes...

1975
02:08:00,789 --> 02:08:02,654
My eyes...

1976
02:08:09,031 --> 02:08:11,158
So much to tell you.

1977
02:08:11,234 --> 02:08:12,896
Later.

1978
02:08:12,970 --> 02:08:14,164
Later.

1979
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:19,968
There's no more time to explain.

1980
02:08:20,045 --> 02:08:22,070
I think I know most of it.

1981
02:08:25,519 --> 02:08:26,543
You know?

1982
02:08:26,620 --> 02:08:28,588
I think so.

1983
02:08:28,655 --> 02:08:31,647
You know that I always...

1984
02:08:31,725 --> 02:08:34,889
Yes, Joan.

1985
02:08:34,962 --> 02:08:36,555
Strange.

1986
02:08:38,333 --> 02:08:40,734
It's strange to die...

1987
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:46,532
when you love.

1988
02:08:46,609 --> 02:08:49,704
You are my life.

1989
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:52,545
My arm.

1990
02:08:52,617 --> 02:08:55,245
My arm can never embrace you.

1991
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:59,815
You are in my arms and I in yours.

1992
02:09:08,135 --> 02:09:09,763
I understand you.

1993
02:09:19,182 --> 02:09:21,651
"Love" is no word for it.

1994
02:09:21,719 --> 02:09:24,051
It isn't enough.
It's a small part only.

1995
02:09:24,121 --> 02:09:25,952
It is so much more.

1996
02:09:35,568 --> 02:09:37,093
Yes.

1997
02:09:37,171 --> 02:09:39,503
Yes, you are always with me,

1998
02:09:39,573 --> 02:09:41,735
no matter whether
I loved you, hated you,

1999
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:43,607
or seemed indifferent.

2000
02:09:43,678 --> 02:09:46,647
That never changed anything.

2001
02:09:56,961 --> 02:09:58,952
You are always with me.

2002
02:10:10,810 --> 02:10:12,471
Ravic.

2003
02:10:14,682 --> 02:10:18,517
I was only more lost without you.

2004
02:10:18,587 --> 02:10:21,751
You were all the brightness

2005
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:25,954
and the sweet and the bitter.

2006
02:10:36,074 --> 02:10:37,565
Doctor.

2007
02:10:38,778 --> 02:10:40,211
Dr. Ravic.

2008
02:10:42,248 --> 02:10:44,911
The patient in number 12 is dead.

2009
02:10:44,985 --> 02:10:46,475
You may notify the police.

2010
02:10:46,553 --> 02:10:47,815
Very well.

2011
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:55,462
Do you live here?

2012
02:10:55,531 --> 02:10:56,463
Yes.

2013
02:10:56,532 --> 02:10:59,331
Take your place in line, please.

2014
02:10:59,402 --> 02:11:01,632
Hello, Boris. You, too?

2015
02:11:01,705 --> 02:11:04,503
This war, they want to see
everybody's papers.

2016
02:11:04,574 --> 02:11:06,770
I was asleep, idiot that I am.

2017
02:11:06,844 --> 02:11:08,277
I could have warned you.

2018
02:11:08,346 --> 02:11:09,507
I'm through running.

2019
02:11:11,116 --> 02:11:12,105
Next.

2020
02:11:13,419 --> 02:11:15,478
You know where they will put you.

2021
02:11:15,555 --> 02:11:17,183
I've been there before.

2022
02:11:17,257 --> 02:11:19,122
There is rumor they are going to set up

2023
02:11:19,193 --> 02:11:21,559
concentration camp at Longchamp.

2024
02:11:21,628 --> 02:11:24,096
Maybe they'll set us free again soon.

2025
02:11:24,164 --> 02:11:25,894
We can be used.

2026
02:11:25,967 --> 02:11:27,832
This is the end of our waiting, Boris.

2027
02:11:27,902 --> 02:11:28,994
- Next.
- Oh, no.

2028
02:11:29,071 --> 02:11:30,629
Not so fast.

2029
02:11:30,706 --> 02:11:32,264
Perhaps not.

2030
02:11:32,341 --> 02:11:34,606
But you will see the day.

2031
02:11:34,678 --> 02:11:35,702
Next.

2032
02:11:40,083 --> 02:11:41,108
Boris.

2033
02:11:42,920 --> 02:11:45,549
Joan is dead, shot by a man.

2034
02:11:45,624 --> 02:11:47,558
She is in Veber's hospital.

2035
02:11:47,626 --> 02:11:50,858
Will you see that she's buried?

2036
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:52,921
No, don't ask questions.

2037
02:11:52,999 --> 02:11:55,332
Just say yes and be done with it.

2038
02:11:55,403 --> 02:11:57,702
- Yes.
- Next.

2039
02:11:57,773 --> 02:12:00,673
And take any of my things
that you can use.

2040
02:12:00,741 --> 02:12:02,175
Move into my room.

2041
02:12:02,244 --> 02:12:04,576
You always wanted my shower anyway.

2042
02:12:04,646 --> 02:12:05,909
All right.

2043
02:12:05,982 --> 02:12:08,473
After the war,
I will meet you at Fouquet's.

2044
02:12:08,551 --> 02:12:11,453
Which side, Champs-Elysées
or Georges V?

2045
02:12:12,523 --> 02:12:14,515
- Georges V.
- Good.

2046
02:12:16,594 --> 02:12:19,586
No, come here, idiot.

2047
02:12:19,664 --> 02:12:22,793
Don't we even dare
say good-bye decently?

2048
02:12:27,374 --> 02:12:29,536
God bless your eyes.

2049

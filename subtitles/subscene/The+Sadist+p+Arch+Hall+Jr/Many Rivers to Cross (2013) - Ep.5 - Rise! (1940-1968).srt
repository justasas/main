HEN RY LOUIS GATES, JR:
By the middle of the 1950s,

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,108
African Americans had
fought and died in war,

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:22,052
achieved success in <i>business,</i>
attained fame on the stage,

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:25,057
on screen, and on
the playing field.

5
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:28,686
But in the South, they couldn't
sit in the front of a bus

6
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,993
or eat a hamburger
at a lunch counter.

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,932
GATES, VOICE-OVER: Nearly
a century after emancipation,

8
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,663
many found these
contradictions intolerable.

9
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:43,231
Out of this was born a new
determination and resolve

10
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,799
to stand up and fight.

11
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:50,276
At first, these defiant acts
were tiny ripples of hope,

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,443
as Robert Kennedy
once described them.

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,389
But soon, they would converge to
form a mighty current of change,

14
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:04,624
in a mass movement that would
forever alter America.

15
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,291
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.:
I have a dream this afternoon

16
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:08,561

Many Rivers to Cross"

18
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,178
was made possible by
Senegal, Africa-

19
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,581
The Door of No Return.

20
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:29,144
From these shores, millions
of Africans went across oceans

21
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:34,023
and continents, battlefields,
racial barriers,

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,120
and constitutional divides.

23
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,156
Bank of America is proud to
sponsor "Many Rivers to Cross,"

24
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:46,297

African American history.

25

GATES: The prologue
to the great drama

54
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:08,451
of the civil rights movement
began in the 1940s,

55
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,284
in northern cities like Detroit.

56
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,388
Tens of thousands of African
Americans migrated here,

57
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,589
lured by the promise
of a better life.

58
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,366
Jobs in the auto industry

59
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:26,405
offered many black Americans

60
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,236
their first chance
to earn a living wage.

61
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:34,638
But economic opportunity
did not mean equal treatment.

62
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,047
My dad and 99%
of all blacks

63
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:39,277
worked in the foundry.

64
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,188
The foundry is
the dirtiest place

65
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,623
at the Ford Motor
Company you could
have at that time.

66
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,890
There were no unions.
There was no
vacation time.

67
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,523
You punched in,
you punched out,

68
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,328
and my father
would come home with

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,265
burns all over his face.

70
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,928
It was just humiliating.

GATES: And the foundry
was where they put Negroes.

72

GATES: As black workers
poured into Detroit,

74
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,211
racial tensions mounted,

and pressure from black leaders,

87
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,955
FDR integrated defense industry
assembly lines.

88
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:58,261
And with that, simmering racial
tensions in Detroit exploded.

89
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,595
KEITH: Detroit was basically
a segregated city.

90
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,867
Not only was it segregated,
it was full of hatred.

91
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,342
You could see the animosity
between blacks and whites.

92
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,575
You had this mixture
of southern whites
and southern blacks

93
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,208
for the first time
being integrated

94
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:21,845
because of the war efforts,
and it was explosive.

The atmosphere
that engulfed our city.

96
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,290
GATES: During the war,
Detroit came to be known

97
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:37,996
as the arsenal of democracy,

98
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,336
but it also was an arsenal
of racial conﬂict.

99
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,342
A race war erupted here in 1943,

100
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,811
and some of the worst violence
occurred on this bridge.

101
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:03,258
The riots broke out.
Everything was in chaos.
My God.

102
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,331
The whites came into
the neighborhood,

103
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,138
just start fighting
and beating us up.

104
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,269
They came into
your neighborhood?

105
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,903
Yes. Oh, sure.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,313
The hatred and venom
in these people.

107
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,908
I told my mother, I said,

"I'm just prepared
to die here

109
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:31,085

GATES: By the time the two-day
riot ended,

00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,500
24 African Americans were dead,

112
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,536
more than half killed
by the Detroit police.

113
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,581
But unlike earlier riots,
this time,

114
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,050
when the smoke cleared,

115
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:04,818
African Americans refused
to return to the status quo.

116
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:07,587

went to war,

with the expectation
that their service

124
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:31,282
would earn them equal rights
once and for all.

125
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:35,684

in return for the promise
of equality,

128
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,323
but they never received
the right to full citizenship.

Black servicemen
and black leaders

130
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:51,095
decided in World War ll that
they would fin ally force America

131

They wanted to prove

that they thought

not only free them,

had changed,

177
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,763
much of the rest of the country
still had not.

178
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:08,304
Black veterans were unprepared
for the discrimination,

179
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,242
even violence, they faced
upon returning home.

180
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,679
It was February 1946.

181
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,814
Army Sergeant Isaac Woodard,

182
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,984
just back from a tour of duty
in the Pacific,

183
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,756
boarded a bus
in Augusta, Georgia.

184
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,667
At a routine stop, Sergeant
Woodard, in full uniform,

185
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,261
asked if he could
use the restroom.

186
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,102
The bus driver
cursed him and said no.

187
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,268
Woodard cursed him back,
demanding respect.

188
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,106
When they arrived
at the next stop,

189
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,275
Woodard was called off the bus,

190
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,218
where two police officers
were waiting for him.

191
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,287
When he tried to tell
his side of the story,

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,887
one of the officers beat him
in the head with a nightstick,

193
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:07,956
driving the end of it
into his eyes.

194
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:17,174
At 27, Sergeant Woodard
would be blinded

195
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,710
for the rest of his life.

196
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,916
African Americans mourned
the Woodard incident

197
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,145
within their own communities,

198
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:31,519
but now, after the war,
many white Americans

199
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,320
shared their shock and horror.

GATES: But even when they

00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:06,989
radio broadcasts were beginning
to shake up the status quo,

212
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,426
especially in the South,
where you could segregate

GATES: In 1949, mite-owned
Memphis radio station WDIA

217
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:30,012
became an accidental agent
of social change.

218
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:35,315
Starved for listeners, it was
forced to broaden its audience.

219
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,480
They were losing money.
No sponsors.
They couldn't get anybody.

220
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,081
So, they brought in
this programming

221
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,320
that was directed toward
the African American--

222
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:46,353
there's 40% African Americans
in Memphis in 1948.

223

GATES: With little left to lose,
WDIA took a gamble.

224
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,734
They switched to

"Mother Station of
the Negroes" as it was

240
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:35,702
called back in the day.

241
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,907
That's all right.

242
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,643
To our audience
and to our community,

243
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,982
we were a big deal.

244
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,294
It gave the black
community a feeling
of pride,

245
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:52,523
a feeling
of involvement,

246
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:55,294
and a feeling
of belonging.

247
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,201
So, we were just, like,
heroes, so to speak.

248
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,569
And I haven't forgotten
our new believers.

249
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,074
About this time on Sundays,
I like to remember-

250
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:09,012
GATES: But WDIA's contribution
went beyond community service.

251
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:12,847
Before long, white kids
began tuning in as well,

252
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,785
giving the station
an interracial audience

253
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,153
in the Jim Crow South.

254
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,921
So, in spite of
the fact that Memphis
is strictly segregated,

255
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,224
white people are
listening to black music

256
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,322
being played and
narrated by black DJs.

257
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,390
Sure. What I think
is really fascinating

258
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,163
is how these kids
who were coming of age

259
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,603
in the late 1940s
and early 1950s,

260
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,106
they're getting exposure
to a message

261
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,837
that is very much that
we are all the same.

262
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,641
So, subconsciously,
this is breaking down
a racial barrier.

263
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,182
I think it is.

295
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,709
In 1951, he presented a petition

298
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,792

in desperate circumstances,

303
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,809

let alone
the state governments,

305
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,242
were doing almost
nothing about it.

306
00:16:57,383 --> 00:17:01,183
He insisted that
economic deprivations

307
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:05,212
were just as destructive
of human life

308

only a Communist revolution

311

could solve the problem
of racial discrimination
in America.

312

Most other

DUBERMAN: At that point in time,
the black leadership
in this country

314
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:35,245
still felt that they
had to present themselves

as good, patriotic Americans,

316
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:42,084

to the creation
of the modern

323
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:06,973
Once the modem
civil rights
movement got going,

324
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,146
he was not regarded
as one of the great

325

precursors, which,
in fact, he was.

326
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:16,553
He was always
on the cutting edge

327
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,823
of racial justice.

328
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,957
GATES: Robeson introduced
a tactic that,

329
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,935
when the time was right,
others would repeat.

330
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:30,438
His public shaming of the United
States before the world

331
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,943
would prove to be a key strategy

332
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:37,505
used by others in the mass
movement to come,

333
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,814
a movement that would
ultimately sweep the nation,

334
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,821
but that began
in the American South.

335
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:02,799
The first major battle of
the civil rights movement

336
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,504
began on a city bus
in Montgomery, Alabama.

337

GATES, VOICE-OVER: On this bus,
on December 1,1955,

Rosa Parks refused to give up
her seat to a white man.

339
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:23,190
The battle over this very seat
launched a revolution,

340
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,628
and Rosa Parks became its icon.

341
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,694
Civil rights leaders
had long been looking

342
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:33,534
for the ideal candidate
to challenge segregation

In New Orleans, on the morning

federal marshals escorted
a 6-year-old gin

what was
actually happening.

They didn't say,
"it's a white school.
You're making history"?

00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,765
6 years earlier,
after decades of struggle,

422
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,676
the NAACP had won
a major legal victory-

423
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:10,271
Brown v. Board of Education,

424
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,543
in which the Supreme
Court declared

425
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,518
that the doctrine of
separate but equal schools

426
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,181
was unconstitutional.

427
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:23,353

did not translate into change.

nonviolence would work.

515
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,424
The idea of guns
and power and violence

516
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,291
compared to nonviolence,
I thought,

517
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:54,422
no, you know, violence
would work better.

518
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,399
But what questions
does this raise to us

519
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:00,598
as to how we might
act nonviolently?

520
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:03,038
GATES: Nash and Lewis
attended workshops

521
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,269
led by the Reverend James Lawson

522
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,506
that trained students in
the tactics of nonviolence.

523
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:13,449
The workshops in Nashville
were the only organization

524
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,976
that was trying to do anything
to combat segregation.

525
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,784
That's why I kept going.

526
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,655
MAN: Now, tonight,
we have to have one major

527
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:23,694
role-playing experience.

528
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,389
We just didn't
wake up one morning

529
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,363
and say we're gonna
go and sit in.

530
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,866
We had role-playing.
We had social drama.

531
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,925
Let's send them all
back to Africa.

532
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:34,301
Why don't someone
get these niggers
out of here?

533
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:36,272
[Men talking at once]

534
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,500
[Clapping]

535
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,513
LEVERING LEWIS: The training
involved in nonviolent
passive resistance

536
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:47,108
was specific and demanding.

537
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,951
It takes a lot of courage
to be weak.

538
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,664
JOHN LEWIS, VOICE-OVER:
We had the very first
sit-in in Nashville.

539
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:15,209
I asked a waitress for
a hamburger and a Coke.

540
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:18,807
I said, "I'm sorry,
our management does not

541
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,613
allow us to serve
niggers in here."

542
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,176
JOHN LEWIS, VOICE-OVER:
In spite of all of this.

543
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:27,588
I have to keep loving the people
who denied me service.

544
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,403
[indistinct shouting]

545
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:50,710
GATES: The tactic
worked to perfection.

546
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,979
Passive resistance was
met with brutality.

547
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:03,756
WOMAN: <i>°</i> We who believe
in freedom cannot rest... <i>°</i>

548
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,293
GATES: Forced to contend
with the escalating violence,

549
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,529
Nashville became the first
major city in the South

550
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,730
to desegregate
its lunch counters.

551
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,707
WOMAN: <i>°</i> ...until it come <i>°</i>

552
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,209
<i>°</i> We who believe in... <i>°</i>

553
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,041
HUNTER: When you get confronted,

554
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:25,082
particularly in the way
that we were confronted,

555
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:29,142
it caused us to reach down
inside of ourselves

556
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,383
and find something that
we didn't know was there,

557
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,652
and guess what it was?

558
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,660
It was courage.

559
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:40,027
WOMAN: °To me <i>°</i>
WOMEN: <i>°</i> Young people

561
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,233
GATES: By the end of April,
in 1960,

562
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:50,730
over 50,000 students had staged
sit-ins throughout the South.

563
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:53,800
They were becoming the vanguard
of the civil rights struggle.

564
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,212
But they had little
support or encouragement

565
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,183
from the movement's leadership,

566
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:04,585
accustomed to employing
less-aggressive tactics.

567
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:08,683
WOMAN: Activism was not
the style of the civil
rights movement.

568
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,127
Some of our elders thought
it was a bit much

569
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,632
to be putting yourself
up for jail and violence.

570
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,225
They certainly refused
to see young people

571
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,203
as a pan of
their struggle.

572
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,269
GATES: A little-known
56-year-old civil rights veteran

573
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,938
named Ella Baker
would change that.

574
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,284
Ella Baker,
granddaughter of slaves,

575
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:36,252
had been a grassroots organizer

576
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:39,552
all over the South
for two decades.

577
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,525
A quiet but radical force.

578
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,117
She would say,
like the turtle,

579
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:46,686
you have to put your
tail on the line,

580
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,291
and the students
could understand that,

581
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:55,772
and...we did put our
tails on the line.

582
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,537
GATES: Now together with
students less than half her age,

583
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,477
Baker helped found
a new organization-

584
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,812
the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee,

585
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,646
known as SNCC.

586
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,914
NORTON: The level
at which SNCC operated

587
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,047
was the most dangerous level.

588
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,318
It was the shock troop level.

589
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,418
They went into towns
and the places

590
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:21,329
where segregation
ran amok.

591
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,026
They were in
pans of the South

592
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:26,195
that can only be
called terrorist.

593
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,933
Historically,
civil rights and many
other movements

594
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,067
are top-down.

595
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,011
Mrs. Baker believed
that the ultimate

596
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,139
source of power is at

597
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,776
the level where
the people are.

598
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,253
Up here does not
direct down here.

599
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:47,189
Down here
directs up there.

600
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:52,821
The day has come when racism
must be banished.

601
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,695
GATES: So many people
of your generation,
you two,

602
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:59,999
describe her as
this visionary force.

603
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,768
Why isn't she
a household word of the
civil rights movement?

604
00:34:03,841 --> 00:34:07,106
Because the movement
was-l hate
to say this-

605
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:10,545
it was dominated
by ministers

606
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:13,345
and religious
leaders,

607
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:16,819
and they didn't
see a role

608
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,947
for women in
leadership position.

609
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:21,890
Until the killing of black men,

610
00:34:21,959 --> 00:34:24,359
black moth er and son,

611
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,263
becomes as important
to the rest of the country

612
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,459
as the killing of
a white mother and son...

JOHN LEWIS: She took
the long sweep of her life
and her experiences

619
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:48,246
and poured it
into young folks.

620

GATES: Ella Baker and SNCC
helped the civil rights movement

621
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,717
broaden and gain momentum.

622
00:34:55,827 --> 00:35:00,025
Up to this point, the movement
had been focused on the South.

623
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,430
It had not found its voice
in the North.

624
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:11,371
Here in Detroit, that began
to change in 1963.

625
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,937
GATES, VOICE-OVER: By then,
black people in Detroit

626
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:18,743
had lost many of
the gains they had made

627
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,444
during and after World War ll.

628
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,682
Most were underemployed
and undereducated.

629
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,756
But Detroit was also the home
of what would become

630
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:36,323
the most successful black-owned
business in the country.

631
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,927
On this street, a man
named Berry Gordy

632
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,234
founded a small record label

633
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:45,275
and transformed it
into a factory

634
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:47,106
of black creative genius.

635

638
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:55,811
GATES: Like many black
businessmen in the early 1960s,

639
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,514
Berry Gordy was a bit concerned

640
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,022
about how the militancy
of the civil rights movement

641
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,991
might affect his bottom line.

642
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,289
But all that changed
the day that

643
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:08,059
the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. came to town.

644
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:12,091
Dr. King came to Detroit
in June 1963,

645
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,003
hoping to spread his
gospel of nonviolence

646
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:17,040
to a northern audience.

647
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,875
KING: Segregation is
a cancer in the body politic

648
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,073
which must be removed before our

649
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,241
democratic health
can be realized.

GATES: Always one
to spot a trend,

652
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,121
Berry Gordy stepped in
to sell the speech.

653
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,652
You know what that speech was?

654
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,560
It was the prototype
of "I Have a Dream."

655
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,292
KING: I have a dream
this afternoon

656
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,266
that one day...
[Applause]

657
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,835
One day little white children
and little Negro children

658
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:56,107
will be able to join hands
<i>as</i> brothers and sisters.

659
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,910
I have a dream this afternoon.

GATES: In Detroit's cavernous
Cobo Hall,

661
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,589
Dr. King spoke before 25,000
eager listeners.

662
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,217
KING: ...simply because
people want to be free.

663
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,954
GATES: The recording
of the speech

664
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,496
made it onto
the "Billboard" charts.

665
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,862
KING: We've come
to see the power

666
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,299
of nonviolence.

667
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,897
We’ve come to see that this
method is not a weak method.

668
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:25,636
GATES: But that same year,
a different voice

669
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,178
came to Detroit as well.

670
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:32,580
MAN: Revolution is bloody.
Revolution is hostile.

671
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,141
Revolution knows no compromise.

672
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,154
GATES: And a different kind
of speech was recorded.

673
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,816
MALCOLM X: Revolution
overturns and destroys

674
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,621
everything that gets in its way.

675
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:47,027
GATES: Malcolm X spent much of
his youth in northern cities

676
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:51,728
and became radicalized
by his experiences in prison.

677
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:55,294
While there, he convened
to the Nation of Islam

678
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:59,400
and embraced the concept
of armed self-defense.

679
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:04,210
X: There's no such thing
as a nonviolent revolution.

680
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:10,450
Whoever heard of a revolution
where they lock arms,

681
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:12,352
sing "We Shall Overcome"?

682
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,358
GATES: Malcolm X
appealed to those

683
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,521
impatient with
the pace of the movement

684
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:22,122
unfolding in the South.

685
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,932
To them, nonviolence
looked like capitulation.

686
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:30,303
Facing police brutality,
failing schools,

687
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,433
and widespread unemployment,

688
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,276
north em African Americans were
less interested in desegregation

689
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,043
than in economic
and racial justice.

690
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:44,042
MAN: Malcolm's appeal
on one level is with

691
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,613
working-class people,
with the working poor,

692
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:53,130
people who might be
what we call underclass

693
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:55,028
in contemporary America.

694
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:58,068
Now, he also has an appeal
beyond that as well, because

695
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,696
Malcolm is able to articulate
repressed emotions

696
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:05,139
that even the black middle class
and upper middle class feel.

697
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,642
Malcolm really is black
America's prosecuting attorney,

698
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:13,843
prosecuting white Americans
for what he's gonna argue

699
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:17,786
are crimes against the black
community and black humanity.

700
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,153
Whereas King serves as
a defense attorney

701
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,387
for both African Americans
and whites towards each other.

702
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,450
He's a mediator.

GATES: For a brief moment here
in Detroit, in June of 1963,

704
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:38,072
followers of Dr. King
and Malcolm X came together,

705
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,634
marching side by side in
the great walk for freedom,

706
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:46,411
the largest march for racial
equality up to that point.

707
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:51,251
KEITH: It was a tremendous,
tremendous gathering of blacks,

708
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,951
and seeing my people
together like this,

709
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,893
marching for freedom,
meant everything to me,

710
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,922
and it inspired me,
because I said, "My God,

711
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,934
"if we work together

712
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:10,463
"and realize what we
can do as a community,

713
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:12,338
<i>we can break mesa

714
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,408
WOMAN: The freedom march
helped to change

715
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,418
our convictions in the North.

716
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,751
We began to see that we could
play a role in the struggle.

GATES: Veteran activist
Grace Lee Boggs

718
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:32,720
and her husband James were
organizers of the march.

719
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:35,197
BOGGS: People were not quite
sure how to choose

720
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,359
between Malcolm and Martin

721
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,132
and to see how both
of them mattered.

722
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,435
GATES: So on June 23,
1963, would you say

723
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,874
this was a Malcolm city,
not a Martin city?

724
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,639
There was a lot of sentiment
in the city

725
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,478
that King was a little naive
and all that sort of stuff.

726
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,575
I mean, we were so
sophisticated.

727
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,176
Why was he naive?
Because he was
southern

728
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,187
or because of all
this nonviolence?

729
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,883
I don't think
we really recognized

730
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:05,691
the philosophic meaning
of nonviolence.

731
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,424
It took us a while
to do that.

732
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:09,056
So King was
ahead of you.

733
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,601
Yeah, in essence.
Ah.

734
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:16,766
But I think by '63
in Detroit,

735
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,072
we were much more...

736
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,477
infatuated with Malcolm,

737
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,378
and we were thin king

738
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:29,476
we had to redefine ourselves,

739
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:32,147
that we had to become
more self-reliant,

740
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,817
more self-determining,

741
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,053
that we had to create
a new dream.

GATES: For the next
few years, however,

Dr. King's nonviolent
civil disobedience

746
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:54,499
continued to dominate
civil rights strategy

747
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,479
as the movement spread
across the country.

748
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,613
PRESIDENT JOHNSON: I am about
to sign into law

749
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,921
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

750
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:12,519
GATES: The more civil rights
protesters suffered violence

751
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,086
and even death,

752
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:17,327
the clearer the justice
of their cause became

753
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:20,427
and the harder it became
to ignore.

754
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,968
The civil rights movement
reached a climax

755
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,480
on March 7, 1965,

756
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,948
when a peaceful march
for voting rights

757
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,645
from Selma to Montgomery
turned into

758
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,450
what would become known
as Bloody Sunday.

759
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,583
We're marching
today to dramatize
to the nation

760
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:44,628
and dramatize to
the wand

761
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,960
that hundreds
and thousands of
Negro citizens

762
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,057
are denied
the right to vote.

763
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,036
I remember so well
on that particular day.

764
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:58,040
We came to the highest point
on the bridge.

765
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:01,134
Down below we saw
a sea of blue--

766
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:03,509
Alabama State Troopers--

767
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,310
and a man identified himself
and said,

768
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:09,182
"I'm Major John Cloud of
the Alabama State Troopers.

769
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,550
"This is an unlawful march.

770
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:12,418
You will not be allowed
to continue."

beating us with nightsticks.

777
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:45,377
I was hit in the head by a State
Trooper with a nightstick.

778
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,016

with out television news
coverage,

789
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:16,609
the civil rights movement
would have been

790
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:18,484
like a bird without wings

791
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,318
or a choir
with out a song.

792
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:21,415
Do you think
that's fair?

793
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,689
I think this fight
for righteousness,

794
00:44:24,762 --> 00:44:29,131
for justice, really for
the honor of the country--

795
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,394
it would have been
a longtime

796
00:44:31,468 --> 00:44:33,333
for the movement
to succeed.

797
00:44:33,404 --> 00:44:35,838
Television
was the instrument

798
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:41,105
that, to use
John Lewis' metaphor,

799
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,510

about nonviolence

Once again, the treatment
of its black citizens

823
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:06,585
was becoming a liability
to a nation trying to be

824

the face of democracy
around the wand.

825
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,065
The South was a national

for civil rights.

848
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,703
But despite the
legislative victory,

staged a solo march
across the South

854

to draw attention to the issue
of voter registration.

855

859
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,740
And was shot and wounded
by a sniper.

860
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,141
In the days following
the shooting,

861
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,619
the movement's elders,
led by Dr. King,

862
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:15,021
came to finish what
James Meredith had started.

863
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,491
But this time, they were joined
by SNCC

864
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,090
and its youthful leader
Stokely Carmichael.

865
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,326
JOSEPH: You have two
generations:

866
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,131
the generation that Martin
Luther King Jr. represents

867
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:30,230
and the generation that
Stokely Carmichael represents,

868
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:33,538
and Dr. King's message was
really wearing thin

869
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,601
in this latter half
of the 1960s,

870
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,376
particularly because
there's so much violence.

871
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,213
FORBES: As the violence grew,

872
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:48,748
the willingness
to be passive declined.

873
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:51,225
MIKE WALLACE: Do you think
you'll be able to keep it
nonviolent, Dr. King?

874
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,387
Yes, I think so.

875
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:55,625
I don't have any doubt
in my mind about that.

876
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:56,927
WALLACE: Mr. Carmichael,
are you as committed

877
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,729
to the nonviolent approach
as Dr. King is?

878
00:48:58,802 --> 00:48:59,734
No, I'm not.

879
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,168
Why aren't you?

880
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:02,637
Well, I just don't
see it as a way
of life.

881
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:04,037
I never have.

882
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,473
JOSEPH: The Meredith march is
where Stokely Carmichael

883
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:08,408
becomes an icon.

884
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:09,809
No one in this
country is asking

885
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:10,847
the white community
in the South

886
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,677
to be nonviolent,

887
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:13,943
and that in a sense
is giving them

888
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,248
a free license to go
ahead and shoot us
at Mil.

889

GATES: Carmichael
and the militant activists-

892
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:26,192
they're thinking that civil
rights has not gone far enough.

893
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,130

MAN: We're here in the heart
of the black community

907
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,497
in Greenwood in the deep
pan of Mississippi.

908
00:50:08,572 --> 00:50:09,698
The tensions
within the march

909
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:12,367
are starting to manifest
themselves.

910
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,000
Twilight was coming.

911
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:17,012
This park is filled
with the Meredith
marchers.

912
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:20,974
Stokely Carmichael gets
up to give a speech.

913
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,575
CARMICHAEL: We've begged
the federal government.

914
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,677
That's all we've been doing:
begging, begging.

915
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,313
It's time we stand up
and take over.

917
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,382
CARMICHAEL: Take over.

918
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,483
He talks about
black aspirations.

919
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,824
He talks about how
black is beautiful.

920
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:33,885
And he talks about
how black people

921
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,795
need to control
their own communities.

922
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,561
Every courthouse
in Mississippi

923
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,192
ought to be burned
down tomorrow...

924
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,237
GOUDSOUZIAN: So that
when he drops the slogan,
if you will,

925
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:42,430
when he
starts to say...

926
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:43,564
CARMICHAEL:
What do you want?

927
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,664
GOUDSOUZIAN:
What do we want?
Black power.

00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,341

We want black power.

urging on the crowd,

932
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:52,413

you know,

933
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:53,744
he's got this
massive response.

934

CROWD: Black power!
CARMICHAEL: What do you want?

935
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:57,620
GOUDSOUZIAN:
That's a turning point
in African American history,

936
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,279
and certainly
a turning point
in the civil rights movement.

937
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,347
GATES: I saw it
that night on TV...

938
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,357
Really?

939
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:03,358
With my mother
and my father. Yeah.

940
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,359
What did it
feel like?

941
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,360
Oh, it was
electric, man.

it was like
the top of your head

944

was about to
come off.

945
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,664
Activists had expressed
a lot of these
ideas already,

946
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,668
but black power-

947
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:14,669
Not in my
living room.

948
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,000
[Both laugh]

949
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,404
I never heard it
before.

950
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:19,305
I went, like,
"Whoa, man!"

951
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,867
I'm like
a nuclear bomb
gone up.

952
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,879
Black power [indistinct]

953
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,608
Yeah!

954
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,583
JOSEPH: By the next morning,
the whole nation

955
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:29,744
is talking about black power.

956
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,419
MAN: It was like
the great last march

957
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,156
of these great
civil rights leaders.

958
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,294
And because of that dynamic
going on

959
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,336
between the different parts
of the movement,

960
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:51,238
there emerged, like it was a
process, emerged a new movement.

961
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:53,742
The new movement was
a black consciousness,

962
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,505
black power movement

963
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,980
which was not just political,
but it was a psychological

964
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:01,540
break from the past
and saying,

965
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,781
"We are moving to a new day,
a new change,

966
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:07,756
and we're gonna do it
on our terms."

KING: Like anybody, I would
like to live a long life.

968
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,640
Longevity has its place.

969
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:30,805
But I'm not concerned
about that now.

970
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:36,183

to have run its course.

971
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:42,385
The final tragic blow came
on April 4, 1968.

972
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,723
And I've seen...

973
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:46,727

Less than two years after
the March Against Fear,

977
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,837
the apostle of nonviolence
would be felled

978

spent his life opposing.

HENRY LOUIS GATES JR;
The American Revolution

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,475
was an inspiration
to black people.

4
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,742
They hoped the words
of the patriots

5
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:21,150
would apply equally to them,
but they were wrong.

6
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:25,351
When the armies left the fields,
we were a country of farmers

7
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:28,394
founded on notions of freedom,

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,591
and our largest farms
were worked by slaves.

9
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:38,399
There were 700,000 slaves in
the United States at its birth.

10
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:41,872
They had no rights and no power,

11
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,809
yet they were determined
to hold America to its ideals.

12
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,814
Their struggle would last
for generations,

13
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,283
and that struggle would
fundamentally reshape

14
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,411
the character of our nation.

From these shores,

GATES: Sheffield, Massachusetts.

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,063
At the time
of the American Revolution,

47
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:47,099
this was slave country.

48
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,834
Slavery was legal here,

49
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,272
just as it was
in each of the 13 colonies...

50
00:02:57,143 --> 00:03:01,978
but the Revolution brought
new laws to this land,

51
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,141
and here in this farmhouse,

52
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:08,244
one slave began
to test those laws.

53
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:11,946
<i>Her name was Mum Be“.</i>

54
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:17,588
For decades, she served meals
in these rooms.

55
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:20,292
Then she heard talk
around the table

56
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,166
Of a new Constitution that said
all men were ﬂee.

57
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:27,138
So Mum Bett decided to act.

58
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:34,977
She ran away to the nearby town
of Stockbridge,

59
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,039
where she convinced
a young lawyer

60
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,175
to help her file a suit.

61
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:44,151
Other slaves had sued
their masters before,

62
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,988
but this case was different.

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,893
Mum Bett was challenging
the very existence

64
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,488
of slavery in Massachusetts.

65
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,033
Her argument was that slavery
violated

66
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,036
The most basic principle
of the American Revolution,

67
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,039
that all human beings
were created equal.

68
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,770
It was a powerful argument,
and she won.

69
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:13,318
Mum Ben's victory echoed
across the young nation.

70
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:16,321
Within two decades,
every state in the North

71
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,257
was on the road to abolition,

72
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,725
was on the road to abolition,

73
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,726
and this political
transformation

74
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,422
was accompanied
by a religious one

75
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,456
as an evangelical revival
spread across the country

76
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:33,528
proclaiming that all races
were equal in the eyes of God.

MAN: You have these big,
outdoor preaching sessions

78

to hear a charismatic preacher
give the word of God.

82
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:54,151
BROWN: A lot of it
is the language of Exodus,

83
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,661
which is something that's very
dangerous for s slave society

84
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,197
because when people begin
to read the story of Exodus

85
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,359
and think about the delivery
of God's chosen people

86
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,630
from bondage in Egypt,

87
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:07,229
they begin to think
about their own delivery,

88
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,673
and they begin to interpret that
as God's mandate

89
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,835
for them to become
abolitionists,

90
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,379
and so that becomes very
important in a white awakening

91
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,608
to the evil of slavery.

GATES: The evangelical movement
also offered opportunities

95
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,252
to black people,

96
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:33,027
among them a young slave
named Richard Allen.

97

[Rooster crows]

98
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:40,237
Allen grew up on a Delaware farm
much like this.

99
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,901
In the woods nearby,
he heard traveling preachers

100
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,911
say that slavery
was a mortal sin,

101
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:51,780
and Allen hatched the plan
to make his master listen.

102
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,217
His master
was religious,

103
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,187
but not in any kind
of intensive way.

104
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,519
Richard Allen really
tried to cultivate that.

105
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:01,355
Sounds like Richard Allen
was a bit of a trickster.

106
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:04,021
Allen was a quietly
intensive man

107
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,361
who was always plotting
to gain his freedom.

108
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,196
So once he gets
his masters trust,

109
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,736
he convinces these
antislavery preachers

110
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,863
to visit his
master's house,

111
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,567
and when they do that,

112
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,336
he know what
they're gonna say.

113
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,310
They're gonna convince
Allen's master

114
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,574
that he is sinning
and is gonna go to hell

115
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,171
unless he emancipates.

116
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,217
Allen put the
kajunga on him, man.

117
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,184
Well, as he puts it
in his autobiography,

118
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,448
soon after the preachers
visited his house,

119
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,888
"my master allowed us
to buy our freedom."

120
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,653
So he knew
what he was doing

121
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,854
every step of the way.

124
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:45,401
He soon became a preacher

spreading the message
of equality,

126
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:53,806
and in the winter of 1786,
he arrived here in Philadelphia.

[Gavel bangs]

132
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:09,723
That opposed slavery
on religious grounds.

133
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:12,924
It was also a magnet for
a steadily growing population

134
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:16,765
of free black people.

in culture, to find
new job opportunities,

139
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,906
to bond
in a social way.

140
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,780
GATES: Allen was invited
to preach in a white church

141
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,684
that was caught up
in the spirit of the time.

142
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:38,781
It must have seemed like
he'd reached the Promised Land,

143
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,851
but Allen soon faced
a hard fact.

144
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,195
Freedom was one thing.
Equality was something else.

145
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,995
NEWMAN: Race rears
its ugly head.

146
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,903
White preachers there

separate black
Congregationalists.

148
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,210
By the 1790s there's
gonna be a black pew

149
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,645
which is separate
and above the white pew,

150
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,275
and Richard Allen thinks
that this violates

151
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,979
everything he learned.

152
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,818
GATES: Emboldened,
Allen made a decision

153
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,154
that would change history.

They're not gonna sit

"We never returned."

to start his own church,

the first of its kind
in the United States.

174
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,605
His efforts began humbly.

175
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,700
He bought a blacksmith's shop,
dragged it onto a vacant lot,

176
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:07,712
and set up a temporary parish.

177

For one hopeful moment

but the moment didn't last.

221
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,642
The agrarian South was simply
too dependent upon slave labor.

222
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:22,909
Southern lawmakers began

who wanted to free their slaves.

224
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,220
It was a crushing blow

armed them with homemade swords,

241
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,998
His plans called for 3 separate

242
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,513
to seize the Virginia capital
and kidnap its governor.

243
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,516
Slavery was to be ended

two slaves panicked

In the end,
in your judgment,

255
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,258
was Gabriel a patriot?

256
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,960
He believed in what
the Founding Fathers

claimed were
American ideals.

258
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,632
He believed in freedom
for all people.

259
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:29,606
He didn't
want to kill people

260
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,199
for the sake
of killing people.

261
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,904
He wanted to kill
a handful of people

262
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,775
to free several
hundred thousand

263
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,806
enslaved Virginians,
and that, I think,

264
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,078

a phase in which ideas
about black freedom

00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,983
It was the largest
forced migration

354
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,418
in American history...

355
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:48,019
and it filled the countryside
with a haunting sight-

356
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:53,087
slaves chained together
marching south.

357
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,157
[Chains rattling]

358
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,466
WOMAN: You'd hear
the clanking of chains

359
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,132
as the enslaved people
walked through here.

360
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,834
Like a prison gang.

361
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,604
Exactly, exactly.

362
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,577
The men usually
were in front,

363
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,477
and they were always
chained by the necks

364
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,243
and by the wrists.
Hmm.

365
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,216
Women weren't
always chained,

366
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,980
but sometimes
they were.

367
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,782
I always
tell people

368
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,447
to think about
the 5 senses

369
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,957
when you talk
about slavery.

370
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,652
So what do you hear?
What do you think?

371
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,251
What do you taste?
What do you smell?

372
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,023
You'll hear weeping
and sobbing and wailing,

373
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,657
and oftentimes when
families were separated,

374
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:30,167
you'll have slave
narratives talk about

375
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,726
how they heard
their mothers screaming

376
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,238
up until the distance,
until the wagon was gone,

377
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,207
or even when
the wagon was gone,

378
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:39,073
they could still
hear the screams,

379
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,668
screams
from the mothers.

380
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,179
Do you have
nightmares about it?

381
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,578
Do you dream
about it?

382
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,980
<i>Yes , yes .</i>

383
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,574
It's the stories about
women and being raped.

384
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:50,053
Here they are, walking 200,
300 miles' joumey, tired.

385
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:53,250
Then at night,
they were being raped.

386
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,589
I can't imagine
the kind of shame

387
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,094
that enslaved
people felt,

388
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,323
and if there was
a partner around,

389
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,593
to have to witness that,
somebody putting their hands

390
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,567
on their partner like that,
must have been really difficult.

391
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,068
It must have been
a nightmare.

392
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,970
Yeah.

GATES:The second Middle Passage
lasted roughly 70 years,

394
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:16,414
from 1790 right up
to the Civil War.

395
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,642
For black people in the South,

396
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:24,087
that meant 70 years
of near-constant upheaval.

397
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:27,023
Slave families that had been
stable for generations

398
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:31,688
were suddenly and irrevocably
shattered.

399
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:33,355
Every time
somebody was sold,

400
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,161
people would come
out of the fields

401
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,225
to say good-bye to the
people who were leaving,

402
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,202
and they had certain hymns
that they would sing

403
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,068
about seeing each other
again in heaven,

404
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,972
and so that music
and paying homage

405
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,306
to those people was
really a way of saying

406
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:49,211
they did have bonds
and then when those

407
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,579
were being broken,
they had to have

408
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,585
some kind of way
of saying good-bye.

affected every African American,

415
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:25,779
even those who were free.

416
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,621
This was especially true
for the free black people

417
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,782
who remained in the South

418
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:37,090
struggling to build lives
within a slave economy.

419
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,528
Some made decisions

420
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:43,090
that are difficult for us
to understand today.

421
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:48,629
This cemetery holds the remains
of the Brown Fellowship Society,

422
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,904
an elite organization
of ﬂee black men

423
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,810
in Charleston, South Carolina.

424
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,815
They came together
to promote

425
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:00,716
their common goals,
their common purposes,

426
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:05,189
mutual elevation,
social advancement, but...

427
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,658
GATES: The Society's members
were craftsmen and tradesmen.

428
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:12,788
Many of their clients
were white slave owners,

429
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:17,563
and some chose to buy slaves
for themselves,

430
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:21,128
but their motives
were complex.

431
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,299
We can't shy away
from the fact

432
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,536
that you had ﬂee blacks
that owned slaves

433
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,374
and used them in the same way
that whites did,

434
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,348
but we also know
that you had people

435
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,442
who were free who were--
quote, unquote--"married"

436
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,647
to a slave spouse,
and what they might do

437
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,749
is purchase
the enslaved spouse,

438
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,989
but now the law would not allow
them to emancipate the person,

439
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,530
and so they end up
holding the individual,

440
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,431
who's really their
husband or wife, as a slave.

441
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,662
Why didn't they challenge
the status quo?

442
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,830
They didn't
challenge the status quo

443
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:57,966
because they understood how
precarious their freedom was.

444
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:02,810
GATES: Try to imagine having
to purchase your own spouse.

445
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:06,544
That was the reality

446
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:09,382
in the South.

447
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,548
They existed on the margins
of the largest slave society

448
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,392
in the history of the world.

449
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,826
In the history of the world.

450
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,362
The white planters
who stood above them

451
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,457
were making more money
than any other group in America.

452
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,196
They set the political course
of our nation

453
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,636
by controlling its wealth,

454
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:31,972
crafting a new landscape
with new centers of power...

455
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:38,676
<i>like Natchez, Mississippi.</i>

456
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,981
In 1800,

there were more millionaires
here per capita

459
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:52,452
than anywhere else in America,
and in their day,

460
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,523
money ﬂowed from a place
just nearby.

461
00:23:57,903 --> 00:24:00,997
This is called
Forks of the Road.

462
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,768
It's the dividing point
on a rural highway

463
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,504
right outside Natchez.

464
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,944
It may look like
a sleepy intersection,

465
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,949
but this was once
the second largest slave market

466
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:15,612
in the United States,
a place where black people

467
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,520
from the Upper South
were brought to be sold

468
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,649
into the Deep South.

469
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,023
This was
a specialty market.

470
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,255
You go to certain
places you know

471
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,854
where you can
get what you want.

472
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,627
Mm-hmm.
That was this place.

473
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,964
If you wanted a field hand,
you can find them here.

474
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,129
If you wanted somebody
with more technical skills,

475
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,105
you can find them here--
builders, carpenters,

476
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:37,733
any and everything
you were looking for.

477
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,606
This was like
a shopping center.

478
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,273
What is was was like
going to Costco or Walmart,

479
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,078
but the product
that was being sold...

480
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,051
Were human beings.

481
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,280
Were human beings.

482
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,296
GATES: Tens of thousands
of slaves were sold

483
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:02,561
at Forks of the Road,
and the planters who bought them

484
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,660
weren't just buying workers
for their cotton fields.

485
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:10,174
They had a very specific
interest in women.

486
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:13,905
WHITE: You wanted men
for the heavy labor,

487
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:16,447
and you particularly
may have had an interest

488
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,746
in females for their
ability to reproduce

489
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,184
the next generation
of enslaved people

490
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,619
for your particular
plantation.

491
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:29,449
GATES: The high cost of
purchasing even a single slave

492
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:34,522
meant that most masters tried
to breed their own labor force,

493
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,933
and some went to great lengths
to make it happen,

494
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:44,067
from forced pairings
of slave couples to rape.

495
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,475
Of all the major slave societies
in the New World,

496
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,209
only in the United States
did the slave population

497
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:55,049
naturally increased over time.

498
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,250
The 400,000 people
that we imported from Africa

499
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:04,284
had become nearly 4 million by
the outbreak of the Civil War.

500
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:08,162
The numbers are staggering,

501
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:12,397
and so was the violence required
to keep them all under control.

502
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,767
This small museum
in Walterboro, South Carolina,

503
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:23,143
holds evidence of that violence,

504
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:26,615
objects that seemed to come
from the Middle Ages.

505
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,051
Oh, man, look at that.

506
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,849
Yeah, for the neck.

507
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:35,991
A whip.
Right.

508
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,621
They would pour salt
in the wounds of people

509
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:40,494
after they
had been whipped--

510
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:43,033
men, women,
children whipped.

511
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,569
Slave muzzle. Mm.

512
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,537
What had
that person said?

513
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,166
Why was that person
being muzzled?

514
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:53,335
What always strikes me when
I look at items like this,

515
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,777
probably some
enslaved blacksmith

516
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:57,747
created these items.

517
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,909
Mm. He had to make
the instruments

518
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,577
for your own
oppressor.

519
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,143
Exactly, exactly.

520
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,848
What choice
do you have?

521
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,720
The shackles...
Mm...

522
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,520
BROWN: You have all these
implements of torture

523
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,118
which are tools for
punishing people, right,

524
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,187
who don't do what
they're supposed to do,

525
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,164
but they're also
symbolic, right?

526
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,224
So if you see someone
muzzled or whipped

527
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,826
in your community,

528
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,927
you're warned
what not to do.

529
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,844
It creates this
pervasive sense

530
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:31,575
of fear and terror.

531
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,447
Slave doesn't
have to mean

532
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,213
that you're whipped
every day,

533
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,015
you're raped every day,

534
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,079
that you're tenured
every day

535
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,591
to be incredibly
destructive

536
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,788
to one's spirit
and soul and being.

537
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,730
You just have to commit
such shocking violence

538
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,427
upon the bodies
of a few examples

539
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,630
that nobody else would
dare to think about it.

540
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,969
Now, the funny thing is,
people still do dare,

541
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,838
right, right?

542
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,638
You still do have
people saying,

543
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,611
"Well, whatever
they got,

544
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,341
it's got to be
better than this."

545
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:17,420
GATES: Early on the morning
of August 22,1831,

546
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:21,488
a group of slaves crept
into the plantation house

547
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:25,798
that once stood
on these Virginia fields.

548
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,634
They killed the planter
and his wife.

549
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,335
Then they killed the children.

550
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,345
The bloodiest slave revolt in
American history was underway.

551
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:47,648
Over the next two days, more
that 60 white people would die.

552
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,826
WOMAN: They go house to house,
and as they go,

553
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,364
they pretty much kill
every man, woman, and child

554
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,297
that they can find.

555
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,460
It was in credibly
personal.

556
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,731
The people that
these rebels were killing

557
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:03,330
were often people whom
they've grown up with,

558
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,673
whose parents
had enslaved their parents.

559
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,177
GATES: The slaves were led
by a man named Nat Turner,

560
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,980
a self-styled prophet
who claimed that God

561
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,817
had told him to slay
his enemies.

562
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,347
In hindsight, his motives
seemed much simpler.

563
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,053
GATES: Why did he do it?

564
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,529
Why him? Why here?
Why then?

565
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,625
He did it because
slavery was awful.

566
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,897
Slavery was horrible.

567
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,997
He did it because daily
he was watching

568
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,974
communities
be torn apart.

569
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,772
He did it because
he knew the stories

570
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:44,144
of women abused
by slave owners.

571
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:47,412
He knew the stories
of how, from farm to farm,

572
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,953
being split up
was horrible...

573
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,750
Mm-hmm.

574
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,348
And he knew
the constant threat

575
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:55,824
of being shipped away.

576
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,793
GATES: Turners revolt
was crushed on this field

577
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:05,700
by a local militia.

578
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:10,969
Looking back, it's easy
to see it as a suicide mission,

579
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:15,172
the desperate act
of a people pushed too far,

580
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,738
but it was more than that.

581
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,309
Turner made real the secret
hopes of millions of slaves,

582
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:27,450
And he sent shockwaves
across slaveholding America.

583
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,891
BROWN: The Nat Turner
revolt happens

584
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:32,623
in an international context
where not only

585
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:34,665
are the abolitionists
in the North beginning

586
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,496
to gear up their agitation
against slavery,

587
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:42,632
but also in the British Empire,
slavery is on its last legs.

588
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,302
In 1838, it's over,

589
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,937
and slavery has ended
in the British Empire.

590
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,379
South em planters

591
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:53,508
are overwhelmingly
concerned with this.

592
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,418
They know that if slavery
is not defended aggressively,

593
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,785
it's gonna be over, right,

594
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,587
and Nat Turner is just
one warning signal among many

595
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,254
that they're on the losing side
of a global battle

596
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,231
GATES: In the wake
of turner's revolt,

597
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,736
Southern planters defended
themselves

598
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,502
by launching an intense
ideological campaign

599
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:20,476
projecting an image
of happy slaves

600
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,013
and benevolent masters,

601
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,984
arguing that their way of life
was beneficial to both races.

602
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,987
MAN: There were some
proslavery writers who argued

603
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,717
that what slavery really was

604
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:37,921
was the possibility of
perfecting the human condition.

605
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:42,797
It's like Americans have been
given this gift of Africans.

606
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:46,564
These were people who came
to see slavery

607
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,368
as something not just good,

608
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,965
but natural, permanent,

609
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:56,207
possibly the way you create
the ideal community,

610
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:59,580
the ideal wand.

611
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,916
GATES: Scientists even tried
to prove that black people

612
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,922
were pan of
a different species,

613
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,256
a species suited for slavery
by nature.

614
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,319
BERRY: They would actually
start measuring

615
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,558
the size
of black people's skulls,

616
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,100
and they would talk about how
they were not as intelligent

617
00:32:17,168 --> 00:32:19,068
because of the shapes
of their heads,

618
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,934
the size of their brains,
and then they would look

619
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,565
at things like
how robust they were

620
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,734
in terms of not their brains,
but their bodies,

621
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,869
and they'd say, "Well, look
at their physical bodies.

622
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,607
They're made
for this kind of work."

623
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:37,819
GATES: Even in the North, these
racist attitudes held sway.

624
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,655
Newspapers brimmed
with grotesque caricatures

625
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,752
of free black people.

626
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,128
Laws were written
to restrict their rights,

627
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:52,898
and racial violence
became commonplace.

628
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,700
BROWN: There are a lot
of white people in the North

629
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:56,831
who are just plain racist and
don't want black people around,

630
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,843
and so black people find
that they're restricted

631
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,379
to certain jobs
and certain industries.

632
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,644
They find they're restricted
to certain places within a city.

633
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,981
They find they're only allowed
to bury their dead, right,

634
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,316
in burial grounds
for black people.

635
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,220
BLIGHT: Free blacks,
North or South,

636
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:18,092
were this kind
of an American caste set apart.

637
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:22,292
They lived insecure lives,
threatened lives,

638
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:27,634
and we know this because
of certain mobs, riots.

639
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:31,869
A black orphanage
in New York City was bu med.

640
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,969
Black schools
were sometimes attacked.

641
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:38,709
They were always
weak in cohesion,

642
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,513
weak in wealth, weak in power,

643
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,612
but, nevertheless,
they were survivors,

644
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,522
and they had leaders.

645
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,232
GATES: Despite all
they had endured,

646
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,428
free black people
refused to be intimidated.

647
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,670
They had been in America
too long

648
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,337
and invested too much
to back down.

649
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:11,348
In their families,
churches, and jobs,

650
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:15,944
they showed that they were fully
capable American citizens...

651
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:22,658
and they understood that as long
as slavery continued to exist,

652
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,219
no black person
could be truly ﬂee.

653
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:32,765
So they began to agitate for
abolition with increasing force.

654
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,238
They allied themselves
with a few sympathetic whites

655
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:39,435
in the North in order to raise
a chorus of voices

656
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,240
against the slaveholding South.

657
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:46,545
Perhaps the more powerful voice
came from a young man

658
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,586
who simply told his own story.

659
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:49,814
Who simply told his own story.

660
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:58,361
Frederick Douglass was raised
by his grandmother Betsy Bailey

661
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,694
in a cabin near
these Maryland woods.

662
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,792
For the first 6 years
of his life,

663
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:08,168
Betsy was the only family
he really knew,

664
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,903
but then one morning, Betsy
led him away from their home.

665
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:18,944
She had been told to deliver him
to work on a plantation

666
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:21,917
12 miles away.

667
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,749
Douglass had no idea
what was happening,

668
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:30,123
but Betsy did.

669
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,856
She had brought him here
for one reason

670
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,989
and one reason only,

671
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,728
this boy that she
had raised and loved,

672
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:41,738
and that was to abandon him.

673
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,809
When they reached this house,
Betsy told him to go play

674
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,245
with some other children.

675
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,613
Then she slipped away.

676
00:35:53,684 --> 00:35:56,983
He never saw her again.

677
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,716
BLIGHT: The way he remembers it
in the autobiographies

678
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:03,726
is as a childhood trauma,
laying on the ground crying,

679
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:07,025
and for a 6-year-old it was
as though his world had ended.

680
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,701
GATES: Douglass would spend
the next 14 years in slavery,

681
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:17,798
yet he refused to be broken.

682
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,536
He kept trying to escape,

683
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:24,240
and on his third try,
he succeeded.

684
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,942
BLIGHT: He takes a train.

685
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,952
He takes, actually, two trains,
3 ferry boats,

686
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,012
goes through Philadelphia,

687
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,957
crosses the Susquehanna,
the Hudson.

688
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,393
So it was highly planned
down to the moment

689
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:41,295
he would jump on the train.

690
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,526
GATES: Douglass ended up here

691
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,934
in the whaling town
of New Bedford, Massachusetts,

692
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,405
home to a small
ﬂee black community

693
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,773
and central to the burgeoning
abolitionist movement.

694
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,744
This is the place
where he

695
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,508
discovered himself
in many ways.

696
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:59,106
How do you mean?

697
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:01,344
Well, he <i>was,</i>
like many others,

698
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,149
simple
an escaped slave,

699
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,122
and he discovered
a voice, a role

700
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,658
to be an antislavery
agitator,

701
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,092
to be a revolutionary,
if you will.

702
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,857
One of the first
speeches he made

703
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,194
was in the church.

704
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,928
GATES: Douglass found work
on these docks,

705
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:20,470
joined the black church
in the town,

706
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:23,166
and began to speak out
against slavery.

707
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:28,804
Soon, he caught the attention
of white abolitionists

708
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:33,009
who desperately needed
black voices.

709
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,884
MAN: White abolitionists
could be militant and committed,

710
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:40,515
but in their voices the slave
experience would be abstract,

711
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,924
whereas with Douglass,
he was a manifestation

712
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:47,590
of the principal charges
that the abolitionists

713
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,223
were making against
the slave regime,

714
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,461
especially
its destruction

715
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,366
of the family life
of slaves.

716
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,428
He could speak
directly to that

717
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:58,031
in terms of
his own family.

718
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:05,809
GATES: In the summer of 1841,
Douglass came here

719
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,044
to Nantucket, Massachusetts,

720
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,885
to speak
at an antislavery convention.

721
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,653
In the audience sat
William Lloyd Garrison,

722
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:18,957
the leading white
abolitionist of the day.

723
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,999
Douglass was just 23 years old,

724
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,936
but he was about
to alter history.

725
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:30,940
HOLT: It was his first speech
before an integrated audience.

726
00:38:31,008 --> 00:38:32,908
So he was very nervous.

727
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,877
Douglass finishes
his speech.

728
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:37,038
Garrison leaps up and
says to the audience,

729
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:39,275
"Do we have here
a chattel,

730
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,079
or do we have a man?"

731
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:43,416
and the audience
responds, "A man."

732
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,955
"And should this man be
return ed to slavery?"

733
00:38:46,023 --> 00:38:48,082
and the audience
roared no.

734
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,956
Frederick Douglass
was launched.

735
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,824
Yes. He was
invited to join

736
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,887
the Anti-Slavery Society
as a lecturer.

737
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,591
They hired him
on the spot.

738
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,429
They hired him
on the spot, man.

739
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,771
GATES: Douglass began to travel
the North giving speeches,

740
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:07,436
living proof of our nation's
fundamental hypocrisy,

741
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,071
showing audiences
that a black person

742
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:14,550
was every bit the equal
of a white person.

743
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,382
BLIGHT: Frederick Douglass
gave us a critique

744
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:22,518
of the United States
that's unique and as powerful

745
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:25,528
as any we've ever had.

746
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:29,930
He's speaking to history,
to the nation, to the world

747
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,833
about the meaning
of the United States

748
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:36,031
and how it has betrayed
its promise.

749
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:41,101
There's no better voice
of that story and that pain

750
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:46,241
and that promise than Douglass.

751
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,512
I mean, he's the
Martin Luther King and then some

752
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,885
of the 19th century.

753
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,481
GATES: Douglass
and his allies in the North

754
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,322
forced slavery
into national politics,

755
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,125
making it an issue
of intense debate.

756
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:00,897
In the South, slaves pressed
the issue themselves

757
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:04,356
In the South, slaves pressed
the issue themselves

758
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:10,271
by running away whenever
and however they could.

759
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:14,175
Their stories filled
a growing abolitionist press,

760
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,306
giving rise to rumors
of a vast network for escapees

761
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:22,910
soon called
the Underground Railroad.

762
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:26,445
Pan folklore, pan propaganda,
the Underground Railroad

763
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:30,290
was never as large
as we often imagine,

764
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,921
but it was real.

765
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:36,489
A loosely organized network of
safe houses in the border states

766
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:42,028
helped more than 20,000 runaways
make their way to freedom.

767
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,507
The network was run
by free blacks

768
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,204
and sympathetic whites,
and it required

769
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,510
immense courage from them all.

770
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:55,985
This is one of the few
documented safe houses

771
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:59,079
on the Underground Railroad
and the site

772
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:03,024
of at least one
remarkable escape.

773
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,493
WOMAN: Mary Corbett
heard a knock on the door

774
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,690
and it was an enslaved man
who was ﬂeeing,

775
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,630
and the sheriff
was after him,

776
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,225
and he pleaded to her
to help him.

777
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,998
So, she brings him
into the house

778
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,767
and they go all the way
up to the attic area,

779
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:19,435
and she points to
a very, very, very small,

780
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,738
little door in the eaves

781
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,075
and suggests that he try
to crawl in there

782
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,081
and hide himself.

783
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,643
LARSON, VOICE-OVER:
There's a pounding on the door.

784
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,549
The sheriff and his posse
are with him,

785
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,215
and she opens the door
and lets them in,

786
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,554
and she tells them they're
welcome to search

787
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:36,684
any room in the house.

788
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,727
Stop.Tum around.

789
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:44,234
And here's the cupboard
that Sam hid in.

790
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,269
That?
Yes. Mary Corbett

791
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,066
brought him up here
and he--

792
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:49,765
and he squeezed himself
in there.

793
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,603
My God.
It's just so tiny.

794
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,768
LARSON: And the sheriff
decided not to look,

795
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,937
because they didn't think
that a man could
fit in there.

796
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,173
They would've
just caught me.

797
00:41:57,248 --> 00:41:59,409
Ha!
I'm too claustrophobic
to go in there.

798
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,882
I just said, "Look,
let's make a deal."

799
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:03,818
But if the sheriff
is after you with
his dogs and guns,

800
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:04,855
you might
find a way.

801
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:06,446
That's incredible.

802
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,718
No wonder they
didn't look there.

803
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,019
Right.
Amazing.

804
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,455
GATES: infuriated by
all the runaways,

805
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,867
southerners pushed for
harsh laws to stanch the ﬂow,

806
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:24,806
culminating in the notorious
Fugitive Slave Act of 1850,

807
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,571
a watershed moment
in American history.

808
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:37,275
The law required northerners
to help capture

809
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:42,155
anyone even accused of
being a runaway slave...

810
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:47,323
turning the north into
a police power for the south.

811
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:52,529
It also placed every free black
person in terrible danger.

812
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:54,298
WOMAN: Every time you
walked on the street,

813
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:57,898
you were subject to being
claimed as a slave.

814
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:03,607
You're living every day afraid
and watching over your shoulder

815
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:08,641
to make sure that you're
not being watched by someone

816
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:12,280
who was looking for you
or someone else

817
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:15,416
and would happily take you
if they can't find
the someone else.

818
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,525
GATES: As bounty hunters
ﬂooded northern cities,

819
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,657
black people began
to look for freedom

820
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:25,463
in ever-more-distant places.

821
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,561
Small numbers had been
running away to Canada

822
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,129
since the Revolutionary War.

823
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,040
Now they began to come here--

824
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,274
to Niagara Falls on
the Canadian border-in droves.

825
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,151
Why Canada?
No slavery.

826
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,053
And no slavery meant
no slave catchers.

827
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:50,025
In Canada, a black person
could serve on a jury.

828
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:51,891
A black person could vote.

829
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:54,487
A black person
could own property.

830
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:57,534
A black person could
become a citizen.

831
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,762
Canada was for black people

832
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,772
what the United States was
for white people--

833
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,775
the land of the free,
the home of the brave.

834
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:13,111
Over 10,000 African Americans
ﬂed to Canada in the 1850s,

835
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,447
including the most
well-known conductor

836
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,955
of the Underground Railroad-
Harriet Tubman.

837
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:26,191
Tubman settled here, in the tiny
town of St. Catharines,

838
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:31,565
and joined this church, which
became a hub for runaways.

839
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:34,433
There are black families
still living in this town

840
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,339
who trace their roots
back to those runaways,

841
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:43,176
people whose ancestors took
an almost unimaginable risk.

842
00:44:43,247 --> 00:44:46,045
WOMAN: Here is
just one portion of
the descendant wall

843
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,018
from 1838 all the way
to today.

844
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,884
This is portions of
the Cassiel family...

845
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,081
You had to get
out of the south,

846
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,681
and you were
on your own.

847
00:44:54,758 --> 00:44:56,282
What did you have?
You didn't have a map,

848
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,794
you didn't have
the education,
you had nothing.

849
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,853
So, you had to be
able to rely on

850
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:04,628
the north star,
and yourself.

851
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,262
I want to point out
my immediate family.

852
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:08,827
So, this is all
my mother's side.

853
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,032
This is
the home team.
Yeah.

854
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,904
This is
my mom's mom.

855
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:14,603
And then,
bounty hunters
are after you.

856
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,942
So, there was
a lot at risk,

857
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,312
and not many would do it
and those that did,

858
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,146
I mean,
it's documented--

859
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,652
you had to be
a little bit bent.

860
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,621
You had to be...
ha ha ha!

861
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,281
You had to be
totally crazy.

862
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,416
Yeah. Ha! Yeah.

863
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,018
When I was a youngster,
we knew of the stories,

864
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,688
but I never appreciated
any of it,

865
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:36,324
never looked back or
even thought about it,

866
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,834
until I was grown,
and then it's like,

867
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,928
"My God, my people
did that?

868
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:43,267
That's how we got here?"

869
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,105
GATES: The very existence
of these families,

870
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:52,638
an entire community of people
descended from escaped slaves,

871
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:54,445
is a testament
to their strength.

872
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:59,488
BROWN: When I think about
the Underground Railroad,

873
00:45:59,556 --> 00:46:05,153
it makes me want to claim
slaves, right, as my ancestors,

874
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:08,096
because they were genius
in order

875
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,633
to pull something of like this.

876
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:12,293
I think about this and I think,
wow, you know,

877
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,997
slavery is not a shame on me,

878
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,563
because my ancestors
were some of the most

879
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,337
creative, resourceful people

880
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,900
in the history of
the United States.

881
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:24,140
That's a shame
on the slaveholders.

882
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,148
But there's no stigma
that I bear

883
00:46:26,216 --> 00:46:27,376
by being descended from people

884
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,612
who could do something
like that, you know,

885
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,085
who could pull something
like that off.

886
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:36,316
GATES: Unfortunately,
the Underground Railroad

887
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,193
was out of reach
for almost all slaves.

888
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:43,427
Only a fraction ever
made it to freedom.

889
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,203
Their stories are inspiring,

890
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,399
but their experience
was not typical.

891
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,202
As the Civil War drew near,

892
00:46:54,278 --> 00:46:58,647
almost 4 million slaves
remained trapped in a nation

893
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:02,879
still struggling to resolve its
most fundamental contradictions.

894
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:09,319
Their lives were desperate,
and the choices they faced

895
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:10,826
are hard to contemplate.

896
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,108
Covington, Kentucky--
the north em border

897
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,836
of the slaveholding south.

898
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,447
In January of 1856,

899
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,484
an enslaved woman
named Margaret Garner

900
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,416
lived here on a farm.

901
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:42,785
Margaret was 22, she was
married, with 4 children.

902
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,489
Freedom lay just 5 miles away,

903
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:49,327
so she and her husband
decided to run.

904
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,863
They traveled by night
and made it here,

905
00:47:55,939 --> 00:48:00,205
to the banks of the Ohio River,
at dawn.

906
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:05,214
This was the barrier between
slave Kentucky and free Ohio.

907
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:11,016
It was a quarter-mile wide
and frozen solid.

908
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,488
WOMAN: They got here
just before sunrise.

909
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,548
GATES: They must have been
exhausted and terrified.

910
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,718
And-and cold.

911
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:19,023
And cold, yeah,
and they look over there,

912
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,324
and there's
nothing but ice.

913
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,329
Frozen solid.

914
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,456
A natural foot bridge.

915
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:24,159
A natural
foot bridge
to freedom.

916
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,940
GATES: The Gamers
walked across the river,

917
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,444
risking their lives
with every step.

918
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:41,649
And then, they arrived
at a small house in Ohio,

919
00:48:41,718 --> 00:48:44,710
owned by a ﬂee black man.

920
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:48,246
But their triumph
was short-lived.

921
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:53,820
Within hours, federal marshals
had tracked the family down.

922
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,330
They got a big
block of wood

923
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:56,832
and start
ramming in the door.

924
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,629
They try to go
into the windows,

925
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,432
and outside, a crowd
is gathering,

926
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:04,167
just to see this
scene taking place.

927
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,436
Inside,
there's mayhem,
there's alarm.

928
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,603
People
were hysterical
at the thought

929
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,977
that they were so
close to freedom,

930
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:13,846
and had only enjoyed
it for two hours,

931
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,544
and now, you know,

932
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,348
it looks like
they're gonna
be returned

933
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,615
into bondage.

934
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,748
Nightmare.
Yes.

935
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,815
GATES: Barricaded in the house,

936
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:26,124
Margaret Gamer did
something unthinkable.

937
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:29,165
TAYLOR: As the marshals were
battering in the house,

938
00:49:29,232 --> 00:49:33,066
Margaret Garner decided,
rather than return to slavery,

939
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:36,128
she would kill her children.

940
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,106
[Door creaks]

941
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,611
GATES: When the marshals
finally broke in,

942
00:49:49,686 --> 00:49:52,484
they were confronted
by a horrible scene.

943
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:59,018
Margaret had slashed the throat
of her daughter Mary.

944
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:03,123
Mary lay on the ﬂoor dead.

945
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,294
Hiding in the next room
were her two young sons,

946
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,362
still alive, but
bruised and bleeding.

947
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,235
Margaret, knife in hand,

948
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:18,111
was quite clear about
what she'd done and why.

949
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,015
The only
direct quote we have
from Margaret Garner

950
00:50:22,085 --> 00:50:25,282
about the murder
was she <i>says,</i>

951
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,789
"I did the best that
a mother could do,

952
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,349
"and I would've done
better and more
for the rest.

953
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,328
We done
the best I could."

954
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,694
Meaning "I would've
killed them all...

955
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,130
Right.
If I could've."

956
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,064
And for her, she said,

957
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,932
she said this to
a couple of visitors

958
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,164
who saw her
when she was in jail,

959
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,570
that this was freedom.

960
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,134
She called her
deceased toddler a bird

961
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,701
for having
ﬂown into freedom.

962
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,615
GATES: Margaret Garner
quickly became a legend,

963
00:50:57,687 --> 00:51:02,522
celebrated and condemned
across the country.

964
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,083
What she had done became fodder

965
00:51:05,162 --> 00:51:08,256
for both sides of
the slavery debate.

966
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,526
South em whites claimed
that Margaret showed

967
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:15,401
that black people were subhuman,
capable of monstrous deeds,

968
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:19,306
and in need of their masters
paternal care.

969
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:22,106
Abolitionists claimed
that Margaret revealed

970
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,615
the essential inhumanity
of bondage.

971
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:31,643
Margaret Garner stood for
powerful ideas, images

972
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:35,179
on both-all sides,

973
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:39,922
and perhaps not enough
for her own side.

974
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:44,763
Just like "I'm not
a poster child for abolitionism

975
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,565
"and I'm not a defective mother,

976
00:51:47,637 --> 00:51:53,234
"but I am a woman who knows
what it feels like, looks like,

977
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,303
means to be a slave, and I don't
want that for my children."

978
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,225
GATES: Margaret Gamers story
had a final tragic turn.

979
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,033
An Ohio court ruled that
as a slave, she was property,

980
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,729
and couldn't be
tried for murder.

981
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,068
So, she was given back
to her owner.

982
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:27,908
And here, on a riverboat
heading south,

983
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,813
Margaret made one last decision
about her family.

984
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,545
She let her
infant daughter Celia

985
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,679
slip into the icy water
and drown.

986
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:51,334
If Celia had only lived 9 more
years, she would've been ﬂee,

987
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,666
but Margaret couldn't have
possibly known that.

988
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,605
Margaret preferred to kill
her own children

989
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,642
rather than to allow them

990
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,939
to live the social death
of slavery.

991
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:08,279
It was a horrifying decision,
but it tells us something

992
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:10,842
about the America of its time.

993
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:15,621
Slavery was so deeply embedded
in the nation

994
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,684
that violence seemed
the only way to end it.

995
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,664

was coming.

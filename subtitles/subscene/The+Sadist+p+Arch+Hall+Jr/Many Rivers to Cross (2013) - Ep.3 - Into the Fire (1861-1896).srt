[Birds chirping]

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,567
With the outbreak
of the Civil War in 1861,

3
00:00:10,643 --> 00:00:14,340
African Americans,
like the country itself,

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:17,042
were plunged into chaos.

5
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:22,783
Their freedom at stake, they
risked everything for victory.

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:27,088
5 years later, slavery was over,

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,119
but what would freedom
really mean?

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:35,691
Reconstruction brought another
period of roiling uncertainty,

9
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,637
but never did African Americans
relinquish their quest

10
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:45,008
for the real prize-freedom
and the rights of citizenship.

11
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:49,105
The lengths they would go
and the price they would pay

12
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:52,049
make this one of the most
inspiring stories

13
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,678
in American history.

From these shores,
millions of Africans

19
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,640
went across oceans
and continents,

20
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:19,144
battlefields, racial barriers,

21
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,147
and constitutional divides.

Thank you.

43
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:40,688
GATES: In the early morning
of April 12,1861,

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,662
South em cannons opened fire
on Fort Sumter,

45
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,065
A federal garrison
in Charleston Harbor.

46
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:52,536
The North and South were at war.

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,005
When the Civil War began,

48
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:09,350
more than 3.9 million slaves
faced a terrible choice--

49
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,586
to be forced to aid
a Confederate army they despised

50
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,596
or gamble everything on escape.

51
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:21,600
Half a million chose
to break and run.

52
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,102
Not only would they change
the tide of war,

53
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,607
they would change its meaning,
turning a war about union

54
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,075
into a war about slavery.

55
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,372
One of my favorite stories
of the Civil War happened

56
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,883
right here at the battery
just a year

57
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:42,888
after the outbreak of the war
over at Fort Sumter.

58
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:47,393
As Charleston slept,
a young black man, a slave,

59
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,861
plotted his escape
aboard a ship.

60
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,868
Robert Smalls
was a 23-year-old slave

61
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,564
pressed into service
for the Confederacy

62
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,233
aboard a warship called
the Planter.

63
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,444
For nearly a year,
he quietly observed

64
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,606
the movements of the ship
and its crew.

65
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:14,119
Just before dawn
on May 13, 1862,

66
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,623
Smalls took his chance.

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,625
While the ship's officers
slept ashore,

68
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,628
he and his fellow slave crewmen
pulled anchor

69
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:27,291
and eased the Planter
into Charleston Harbor.

70
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,861
MAN: They had prearranged
to meet their family members

71
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,203
and to pick them up,
and then come back

72
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,177
down the peninsula
and they begin the process,

73
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,509
and this is in the wee
hours of the morning

74
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,277
of sailing out of
the harbor.

75
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,253
They are embarked now on
an extremely dangerous journey.

76
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,622
GATES: Smalls knew these waters
like the back of his hand,

77
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:57,629
but he also knew the risks
that lay ahead--

78
00:04:57,697 --> 00:05:00,495
4 Confederate checkpoints:

79
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,024
Castle Pinckney, Fort Ripley,

80
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,402
Fort Johnson,
and Fort Sumter.

81
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,907
Isn't Smalls afraid
of being caught?

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,705
How in the world
is a black slave

83
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,211
gonna pull this off?

84
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,839
He's extremely afraid
of being caught.

85
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,679
He disguises himself
<i>as</i> the captain

86
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,413
and also mimics
the captain's gait

87
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,581
as he walked back and forth
across the wheelhouse.

88
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:30,425
GATES: Smalls slipped past the
first 3 checkpoints undetected.

89
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,932
The most dangerous
checkpoint remained--

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,935
Fort Sumter,
with its mighty guns

91
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,437
and fearsome cannons.

92
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,407
Discovery would mean
certain death.

93
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,636
As dawn broke,

94
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,648
the crew urged Smalls
to take a wide berth,

95
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,709
but changing course
could arouse suspicion.

96
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,879
Smalls gave the signal.

97
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,856
[Steam whistle blowing]

98
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:06,861
A few seconds later,
the countersignal came back.

99
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,733
[Steam whistle blows]

100
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,237
"Pass on by."

101
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,740
So they're safe, right?
They're free?

102
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,868
Well, they're not
completely free

103
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,379
because now we have
this situation where

104
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,383
a Confederate-ﬂagged
vessel is sailing out,

105
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,215
and it begins
to approach the vessels

106
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,723
of the Union naval
blockading force.

107
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,852
GATES: Fortunately,
the vessel was not fired on.

108
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,455
As astonished Union officers
boarded the Planter,

109
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:43,468
Smalls stood at attention,
saluted, and spoke.

110
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:47,131
POWERS: "I am delivering
this war materiel,

111
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,471
"including these cannons,
and I think

112
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:54,070
Uncle Abraham Lincoln
can put them to good use."

113
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,842
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

114
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,645
Smalls was ready with
his line for history.

115
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,618
That's right.
That's right.

116
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,817
GATES: "I don't know exactly
what you are now,"

117
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,825
the officer told Smalls,

118
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,794
"but you're certainly
no longer slaves."

119
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,735
Robert Smalls' escape
personified a new,

120
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,907
more determined attitude
among Southern slaves.

121
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:33,816
Before the war, his bold act
would have been in vain.

122
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,320
The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850

123
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,016
decreed that runaway slaves

124
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,024
were to be hunted down

125
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:44,028
and returned to their masters
in chains,

126
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:48,032
but all that changed
on May 23,1861,

127
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,035
less than a year
before Smalls' escape,

128
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:56,040
when 3 runaway slaves made it
here to Fort Monroe,

129
00:07:56,108 --> 00:08:00,135
a Union-held outpost
in Confederate Virginia.

130
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,976
The slaves were taken before

131
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:05,040
Union Major General
Benjamin Butler.

132
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,052
Defying the law, Butler refused

133
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,556
to return the fugitive slaves
to the Confederacy.

134
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:15,219
Instead, he invented
a new status for them.

135
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,728
They were contraband of war,

136
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:22,291
illegal property now forfeited
to the North.

137
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:27,305
Butler could have no idea
how wide a door he had opened.

138
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,036
MAN: The Contraband Act
doesn't legally free them,

139
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,101
but if you're a slave
on the ground

140
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,047
and you reach Union lines,
that act says

141
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,175
that the officer
is required

142
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:41,015
to retain you,
put you to work.

143
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,486
In practice, you're ﬂee.

144
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,525
GATES: The word went out
through the slaves' grapevine,

145
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,194
and all these Negroes
descend upon Fort Monroe.

146
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,135
I bet the Army didn't
know what hit them.

147
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,969
No, they didn't, and they
didn't know what to do.

148
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,533
Hundreds came over here,
and they were located

149
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,739
in and around the fort.

150
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:12,181
So there were all these
makeshift camps everywhere.

151
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:15,243
Dysentery was very common,

152
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,789
tuberculosis,

153
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,655
all kinds of diseases.

154
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,957
It was a horrendous
situation.

155
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,863
GATES: Neither slave nor free,

156
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,299
the contraband
had found sanctuary,

157
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,962
but were little more
than refugees,

158
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,131
a burden to the war effort

159
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:38,438
in the eyes of some
Northern soldiers.

160
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:42,106
We can't imagine,
I don't think, the cost,

161
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,617
the courage,
the difficulty

162
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,085
of making that journey
and getting there

163
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,591
and some commander saying,
"OK, we have to take them in,

164
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,626
"but don't give them food

165
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,629
because that will
make them lazy."

166
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,599
GATES: Still, the escaped slaves
kept coming

167
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,501
in a great upsurge
of hope and courage.

168
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:15,980
Although their status remained
as uncertain at the war itself,

169
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:20,508
the contraband sought to live
as fully free men and women.

170
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:23,521
Even in the midst
of squalid camps,

171
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,025
they pursued a privilege
long denied to slaves-

172
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,493
learning to read and write.

173
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,760
Some contraband began
their education here

174
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,235
on what is today the campus
of Hampton University,

175
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,535
one of the country's oldest
black colleges.

176
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,542
It was all made possible

177
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,205
by a visionary teacher
named Mary Peake.

178
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,373
For Peake,

179
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,713
an educated woman of color,

180
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:56,551
liberating the mind was as
important as freeing the body.

181
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:01,389
Before the war,
she had taught slaves in secret,

182
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,122
Defying the law,

183
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:07,723
but in Union-occupied
Hampton, Virginia,

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,667
those laws no longer applied.

185
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,205
Peaks conducted her lessons

186
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,707
beneath the branches
of this oak tree,

187
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:20,212
which, incredibly,
still stands today.

188
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,214
No one even knew
at the beginning of the war

189
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,546
if a Union victory
would even lead

190
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,711
to the abolition
of slavery.
GLYMPH: No.

191
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,345
GATES: So why
would she do it?

192
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,357
GLYMPH: I think that,
like a lot of blacks,

193
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,791
she saw this
as an opportunity.

194
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,296
She was passionate
about using her skills,

195
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,798
her talents
and abilities

196
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,733
to help uplift
the community.

197
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,738
GATES: Mary Peake's
contraband students

198
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,741
let nothing keep them
from learning.

199
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,642
GLYMPH : There was
a mother and a daughter.

200
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,646
They were living
in this tent.

201
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,649
They had one dress
between the two of them,

202
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,311
and so, during the day,
the daughter

203
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:03,116
would wear the dress
and go to school

204
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,282
and then come back
afierschooL

205
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,791
and the mother would
then do some work

206
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,794
and then go
to night school.

207
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,794
Hmm.

208
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,797
So they shared
a single dress

209
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,696
between the two of them.

210
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:18,703
How quickly does
her school grow?

211
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,205
It starts
with a handful,

212
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,207
but then quickly,
there are 50.

213
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,766
Then there are
a hundred.
Mm-hmm.

214
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,075
She ended up
with 900 students.

215
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,047
900 students.

216
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,244
What she
was trying to do

217
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,413
was to prepare
people

218
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,322
to really be
full citizens.

219
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,698
GATES: Escaped slaves
were changing their own lives,

220
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:51,226
but they were also transforming
the fate of the nation.

221
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,737
By the summer of 1862,

222
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,741
President Lincoln
faced a dilemma.

223
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,869
Not only was the North
losing the war,

224
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:03,881
but runaway slaves were forcing
him finally to confront

225
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,112
the question of slavery itself.

226
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,121
Lincoln's first objective
in the war

227
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,123
had been to save the Union.

228
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,785
"I have no purpose,"
he had proclaimed,

229
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:19,297
"to interfere with
the institution of slavery."

230
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,459
But now, military necessity
converged

231
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,437
with the moral imperative
of ending slavery.

232
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,476
GATES: This was
the country in 1862.

233
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,479
GLYMPH: It <i>was,</i> and,
therefore, for Lincoln,

234
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,175
a place he could escape to.

235
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,184
He came here pretty often
in the summer

236
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,550
of '62, which is
his critical summer

237
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,555
where he was writing
the Proclamation.

238
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,056
This is Camp David.

239
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,117
This is his Camp David.

240
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,629
As he wrote
and made the journey

241
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,495
to this cottage,
he would have seen

242
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,434
black refugees camped out
all over the city.

243
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,030
What do you do with them?
Do you just keep ignoring them?

244
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:05,907
Enslaved people were
making the war their war.

245
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,914
They were making
the war about freedom
and emancipation.

246
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,418
STAUFFER: African Americans
are arguing,

247
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:16,045
the easiest way
to win the war

248
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,282
is to emancipate slaves,

249
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,484
and they make
a brilliant point

250
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,120
that eventually the Lincoln
Administration accepts,

251
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,130
that "You need us.

252
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,635
If you want to win
this war, you need us."

253
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,763
GATES: Lincoln knew
he could no longer avoid

254
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,273
committing himself
and the nation

255
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,140
to slavery's eradication.

256
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,645
On September 22,

257
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,174
Lincoln showed his cabinet
the outlines of a bold plan-

258
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,983
emancipate the slaves
in enemy territory

259
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,458
and encourage them to find
safety behind Union lines.

260
00:14:57,196 --> 00:15:00,131
On January 1, 1863,

261
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:04,135
he issued the final draft
to the nation.

262
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,137
"From that day on," it read,

263
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:08,639
"any slave within
a rebellious state

264
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,141
"shall be then, thenceforward,

265
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,304
and forever free."

266
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,872
Though the Proclamation
didn't abolish slavery,

267
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,384
nor declare all slaves free,

268
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,750
it was a powerful statement,

269
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:26,882
redefining the war's purpose
as ending slavery.

270
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,986
For African Americans,
enslaved or free,

271
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,294
the Emancipation Proclamation

272
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,767
was their Declaration
of lndependence.

273

274
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,637

"thenceforward

That snowball was

281
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:03,461
it just got kicked off, and
there was not stopping it.

GATES: The Proclamation
encouraged slaves

283
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:11,302
to abandon their plantations,
but it couldn't help them do so.

284
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,305
They would have to run

he will be returned

347
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,561
If the owner could not be

the responsibility
and they would be put

But the Confederate soldiers

350
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:36,239

this "Remember Fort Pillow,"

so important, because
they don't stop.

416
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:21,330

nearly 750,000 lives lost,

00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,303
40,000 of them

419
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:35,608
more deaths than in all other
American wars combined.

420
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,686
As the country entered the
period known as Reconstruction,

421
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:45,587
the massive federal effort
to rebuild a new South,

422
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:50,560
the future of the former slaves
was anything but clear.

423
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,599
Their chains had been struck,
but would they realize

424
00:23:55,667 --> 00:24:00,570
their hope for new lives
as free and equal citizens?

425
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,786
We're heading to Edisto Island,

426
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:19,290
which was the home of
the famous Sea Island cotton,

427
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,951
finest cotton in the world.

428
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,463
Legend has it that even the Pope
wanted his garments,

429
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,466
his vestments,
made out of Sea Island cotton

430
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,265
because this was the place
where black people

431
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,273
actually got a chance
to take their pan

432
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,775
in the promise of America.

433
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:42,280
The promise of America
was always land,

434
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,611
the right to own property.

435
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,776
Who understood that better
than people

436
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,753
who had served
as property themselves?

437
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,291
Can you imagine
what that must have been like

438
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,795
to farm this island,

439
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,798
producing this rich sea cotton
for all those years,

440
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:03,699
back-breaking labor,

441
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,202
and then

442
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,705
having the opportunity

443
00:25:08,773 --> 00:25:12,038
to farm that land for yourself?

444
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,045
It must have been one
of the most exhilarating moments

445
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:18,014
in the history
of the African American people.

446
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,522
All over the South,

447
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,524
that heady promise,

448
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,526
Some land of your own,

449
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:33,030
filled African Americans
with optimism.

450
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:35,965
As the federal government
set about reconstructing,

451
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:41,472
African Americans waited eagerly
to receive their own plots.

452
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,475
Their optimism was born in pan

453
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,636
from a remarkable pledge made

454
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,647
to freed slaves just
a few months before war's end.

455
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,616
Today, the phrase
"40 acres and a mule"

456
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:02,524
has an ironic connotation,

457
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,028
but for newly freed slaves,

458
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,224
it represented
a tangible manifestation

459
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,736
of their new stake in America.

460
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:16,706
In fact, the idea came
from the black community itself.

461
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,113
In January 1865,

462
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:26,742
20 black ministers were summoned
to a meeting in Savannah

463
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,252
with Major General
William Tecumseh Sherman

464
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,722
and Secretary of War
Edwin M. Stanton.

465
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:39,263
The general and the secretary
wanted some advice.

466
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:44,530
What did former slaves
most desire when the war ended?

467
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,369
Garrison Frazier,
the 67-year-old Baptist minister

468
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,342
chosen to lead the group,
responded unequivocally.

469
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,382
"The best way we can take care
of ourselves,"

470
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,251
Frazier told them,
"is to have land

471
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:06,882
"and turn it and till it

472
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,858
by our own labor."

473
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:15,499
"We want to be placed on land
until we are able to buy it

474
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,967
and make it our own."

475
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,006
"I would prefer to live
by ourselves,

476
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:25,838
"for there is a prejudice
against us in the South

477
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,971
that will take years
to get over."

478
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,448

slaves land

479
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,451
and let them be self-governing,

00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,920
and that was the birth
of 40 acres and a mule.

481
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:44,257
4 days later, Sherman issued
Special Field Order 15.

482
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:49,633
Some 400,000 acres
of confiscated lands

483
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:52,636
would be doled out
in 40-acre tracts

484
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,299
to the heads
of former slave families.

485
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:57,807
As a bonus,

486
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,470
Sherman threw in
some broken-down mules

487
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,207
left over from the war.

488
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:07,718
Here on Edisto Island,

00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,017
who had once worked
this land as slaves,

490
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:14,525
could now claim
their own 40 acres

491

as ﬂee people.

492
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,189
So, Bernard,
set the scene for me.

493
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,359
They come back with all
that expectation.

494
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,369
They're gonna get land
for the first time.

495
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,699
They're gonna get
their 40 acres.

496
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:29,035
Yet this would
have been

497
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,041
a very difficult
time for them.

498
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,942
They were more free
than they had ever
been before,

499
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,277
but now they would
be faced with
the prospect

500
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:39,942

501
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,816
and reconstruct
their lives,

502
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,685
and it wasn't
absolutely certain

of their freedoms

That's right.

513
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:28,764
They were only given
what were called
promissory titles,

514
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,768
not permanent titles,
but they expected
to receive clear

515

the land down the road.

President Johnson's order was
a crushing disappointment.

524
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,906
Still, they had little choice
but to keep going,

525
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:13,137
placing their hopes in
a reconstructed South.

526
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,214
GATES: It's something
I wonder about and think,

527
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:20,718
"Jesus, how could you
survive every day

528
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,719
and have hope, build
a family, fall in love?"

529
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:24,880
That's right,
and I guess

530
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:27,686
that's all you have,
is hope, right?

531
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,354
Hope did, in fact, bring
these people through,

532
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,363
and it gave them
a firm foundation upon

533
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,332
which to visualize
their future.

534
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,374
GATES: If hope was to be
the foundation

535
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:47,468
of the former slaves' new lives,

536
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,948
love and family would be
its brick and mortar.

537
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:57,488
GLYMPH: Thousands of people
have lost their kin,

538
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,718
and thousands
of people are very keen

539
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:04,228
To find members,

540
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:07,787
family members, and fiends
who have been sold away.

541
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,959
GATES: In freedom,

542
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,468
they set out to rebuild families

543
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,971
shattered by slavery.

544
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,475
They filled newspapers
with information-wanted ads

545
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,478
seeking long-lost
family members.

546
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,481
GLYMPH: The ads captured

547
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,484
the loss that slavery brought

548
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,953
in terms of having your child
torn from your arms.

549
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,491
There would not be
as many reunions

550
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,494
as there had been separations,

551
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,020
but it didn't stop people
from yearning

552
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,533
and trying to imagine

553
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:48,038
what that babe of 4 months old

554
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,768
looked like 20 years hence,

555
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,744
how had your child fared.

556
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:03,351
GATES: Freedom promised a future
where black women and men

557
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,824
would have control over their
most fundamental decisions.

558
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:11,419
They got married,
they took new names,

559
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:15,432
and they worshipped freely
in their own churches.

560
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:20,028
For the first time,
African American women and men

561
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,507
could define the terms
of their families' labor.

562
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,544
GLYMPH:
A black mother could say,

563
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:32,845
"I will not stay
overnight anymore,

564
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:36,182
"and my 10-year-old daughter
who comes to work with me

565
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:39,985
"every day will now be going
to school for 3 months,

566
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:44,051
and when she is not
in school, she won't be
coming here with me."

567
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,063
It meant reclaiming

568
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,032
your right as a human being.

569
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,643
GATES: The social changes
former slaves experienced

570
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:03,647
were not matched
by economic progress.

571
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,412
One aspect of Southern society
remained fixed--

572
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:11,251
Old King Cotton still reigned.

573
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:16,122
Without land of their own,
many freed slaves

574
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,856
went back to work
on cotton plantations,

575
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:22,024
some for their former masters,
who did their utmost

576
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,002
to impose poor wages
and working conditions.

577
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:30,039
But once in a great while,
a freed slave

578
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,544
seized a chance
for something more.

579
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,546
One such man
was Benjamin Montgomery,

580
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:40,050
who had been the favorite slave
at the Davis Bend plantation,

581
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:44,054
<i>the crown jewel of Mississippi's
planter aristocracy.</i>

582
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,590
WOMAN: Benjamin Montgomery
purchased this land,

583
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:50,650
and he purchased it from
his former slave-own er,
Joseph Davis.

584
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,662
Joseph Davis,
the brother

585
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,893
of the President
of the Confederacy.

586
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,436
GATES: When Union forces
closed in,

587
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,496
Joseph Davis had ﬂed
the plantation.

588
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,507
After the war ended,

589
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:08,341
the elderly Davis made
a bold and surprising choice.

590
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:12,315
He gave his former slave a loan
to buy the property

591
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,284
that he and his brother
Jefferson once shared.

592
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,855
These brick columns are
all that remain

593
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,325
of the house that Jeff built.

594
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:27,363
Standing here,
I try to picture

595
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:30,367
what it was like
in Davis' heyday--

596
00:34:30,435 --> 00:34:33,370
a rambling, 8-room home

597
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,872
with a front and back porch,

598
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,377
from which dozens of slaves
could be seen tilling the soil.

599
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,879
Now, one of them,

600
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:45,882
Benjamin Montgomery,
owned the home built

601
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,919
by the President
of the Confederacy.

602
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:52,615
And soon, he began to recruit
his fellow former slaves

603
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:55,386
to join him at Davis Bend.

604
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,430
FIELD: He would rent out
the land to them, and together,

605
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,864
they would build
a successful cotton crop

606
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,426
that would ultimately bring
profits to all of them.

607
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,995
GATES: And profit they did.

608
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:13,543
FIELD: In 1870,
Benjamin Montgomery was

609
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,545
the third-largest
cotton planter

610
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,638
in the state
of Mississippi.

611
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,149
And that's a lot
of cotton.
Right,
and Mississippi,

612
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:22,584
of course, is
the largest producer
in the country,

613
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,587
so that makes him,
arguably, the
third-largest

614
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:27,089
planter in the country
at that time.

615
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,422
It was not just
the quantity of cotton,

616
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,155
it was also
the quality of it.

617
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,697
He was winning awards
left and right,

618
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:36,699
and he was
widely regarded and
widely respected

619
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,701
by fellow Mississippi
planters,

620
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,101
most of whom were white.

621
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,106
If this were
a Spike Lee film,

622
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,233
the Ku Klux Klan
would have come

623
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,005
galloping down that hill
through the river valley...
Yeah.

624
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,016
Roasted Benjamin Montgomery
and his new plantation.

625
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,052
Right.
But that didn't happen.
Why not?

626
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,553
Local white Southerners,
and white planters

627
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,557
in particular, were
willing to allow him

628
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,116
to carry on with
his economic activities,

629
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,627
as long as he stayed out
of the limelight,

630
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:05,992
or at least that was
his perception.

631
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:07,496
He's doing
a lot of work,

632
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,658
culturally and socially,

633
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,827
to kind of keep people
happy with him,

634
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,564
white people,
in particular.

635
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,074
GATES: Montgomery was playing
a delicate and dangerous game,

636
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,076
appeasing whites
so he could continue

637
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:22,578
to profit from his land.

638
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:25,548
It was a gamble,
but it was paying off.

639
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,619
Ultimately,
African American s knew,

640
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,121
if they were going to protect
and extend the freedoms

641
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,919
they had gained in the South,

642
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,926
they couldn't depend on
the largesse of whites.

643
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,430
They needed political power
of their own.

644
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:43,797
To get it, they needed
the right to vote.

645
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,032
STAUFFER: African Americans
were very, very sensitive

646
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:51,336
and great, in a sense,
historians.

647
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,004
They understood that this
social revolution should be

648
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,482
a revolution about equality
under the law for all people.

649
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,986
If you're African American
and you have the vote,

650
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,488
you have a voice,
you have a public voice

651
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:10,186
that whites had
long sought to suppress.

652
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,695
GATES: Their struggle
for the vote took place

653
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:15,323
in a larger political context.

654
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:20,462
Northern Republicans feared
that the freed African
American population

655
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,972
might play into the hands
of their enemies,

656
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,974
the Southern Democrats.

657
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,805
POWERS:
The Three-fifths Clause,

658
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,313
which was the formula
used for determining

659
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,715
how many Congressmen
any state was entitled to.

of the slaves being counted,

662
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:43,291
now it was the total
free population,

663
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,797
and so that really was
a political boon

664
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:50,527
to the South,
and it would have been
used against the North.

665
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,798
GATES: But if African Americans
were given the vote,

666
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:57,102
they could create alliances
with Northern Republicans

667
00:37:57,174 --> 00:38:00,575
to forge an unstoppable
political force.

668
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,116
The Republican-controlled
Congress grabbed the chance,

669
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:10,176
passing the 14th Amendment,
granting full citizenship

670
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,690
and equal protection
under the law to anyone born

671
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:16,693
in the United States,
regardless of race.

672
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,695
And in the 15th Amendment,

673
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,358
they gave black men
the right to vote.

674
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:25,869
For the first time,
blacks in many communities

675
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,200
did have
equal representation.

676
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,467
You had black legislators

677
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:33,669

the state that fired the first
shots in the Civil War,

680
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,610
saw black men--former slaves--

681
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,779
elected to office.

682
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,345
One of them was Robert Smalls,

683
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:49,860
the same man who had
narrowly escaped from slavery

684
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:52,725
on a boat in Charleston Harbor.

685
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,731
In 1868,

686
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,734
Smalls was elected by the voters
of Beaufort County

687
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:00,737
to the South Carolina House
of Representatives.

688
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:04,639
All told, some 2,000
African Americans

689
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:10,477
would hold office
between 1868 and 1876.

690
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,346
There were sheriffs,
justices of the peace,

691
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,544
EVEN mayors.

692
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,349
The first African Americans
would be elected

693
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:20,356
to the United States Senate

694
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,291

a society in which
blacks had rights,

in which blacks
were treated as humans.

721
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,223
They just assumed
that black supremacy

722
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,384

white supremacy,

of his native New Orleans
toward the train station.

[Train bell clanging]

869
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:22,089
This was no idle stroll.

870
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,595
He was about to test
the 14th Amendment's promise

871
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:28,597
of equal protection
under the law.

872
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,963
He would board
a white passenger car

873
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,561
and refuse to move
to the black one.

874

GATES: OK, June 7,1892,

875
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,700
the Press Street depot.

876
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,711
What is Homer Plessy
doing there?

877
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:44,713
Homer Plessy is
attempting to be

878
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,717
arrested, booked,
and tried

879
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,720
for violating the
segregation laws
of 1890.

880
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:53,221
I don't think he was
very confident

881
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:55,724
that he wouldn't be
hung that day

882
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,226
because there was
a serious plan in effect

883
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,355
to actually orchestrate
his arrest.
Mm-hmm.

[Bell clan gs]

885
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:06,368
GATES: Conceived by a group
of black Republicans,

886
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:11,032
Plessy's gambit was a calculated
act of civil disobedience--

887
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:15,545
breaking Louisiana's law
in the hope of landing the case

888
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,479
in the United States
Supreme Court.

889
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,641
The group had chosen
Homer Plessy

890
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:23,151
for one overriding reason:

891
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,552
he was so light-complexioned

892
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,056
that he was indistinguishable
from whites.

893
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,060
GATES: Why did they need
a guy light and bright
and damn-n ear white?

894
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,063
BROWN: What they wanted
to do is to tell the courts

895
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,565
that, you know, you're
putting someone on there

896
00:50:36,633 --> 00:50:39,568
whose race has
to be determined by
a train conductor.

897
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,900
How can this be
the basis of law

898
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:44,497
when every
train conductor has
to look carefully,

899
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:46,303
right, at people's skin
and look and say,

900
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,741
"Oh, l think this person
is a Negro"-

901
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,745
Negro reader.
Yeah, exactly, right?

902
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,611
As if they would have
a Negro meter or
something like that.

903
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,582
It's patently absurd.

904
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,620
Plessy gets his ticket,

905
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,952
he goes right past
the colored car,

906
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:04,721
sits in the white car,
and that's when a
plain-cloth es officer

907
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,491
warns him to get off
the train and, when he
doesn't move,

908
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,498
arrests him
and takes him off.

909
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:14,003
GATES: The case did make it all
the way to the Supreme Court,

910
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,508
but the Justices didn't do what
Plessy and his backers hoped.

911
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,668
In a momentous decision
that would shape

912
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,678
the next half-century,

913
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,773
they upheld Louisiana's
segregation law.

914
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,546
The Supreme Court decided

915
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,053
that separate but equal

916
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,056
was the law of the land.

917
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,058
Justice might be blind,

918
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:38,560
but the United States
Constitution

919
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,791
would no longer be
color-blind.

920
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,334
The Plessy decision dealt
the final blow

921
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,305
to the brief, ﬂickering hope
of Reconstruction.

922
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,411
Now, the law relegated
African Americans

923
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,880
to the margins
of white society.

924
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,440
Free? Yes.

925

Equal? No.

BROWN: That drastically reduces
the horizons for black people.

927

they begin to live

the federal government

929

and the state governments.

930
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:23,631
It doesn't mean
the traditions
of struggle end.

931
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:28,508

the darkest days of
Jim Crow segregation,

freedom struggle
never goes away.

GATES: The poet Langston Hughes

934
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:49,165
would compare the extraordinary
experience of Reconstruction

935
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:52,167
to a telescope of dreams.

936
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:56,171
Seen through one end,
the dream "looms larger,

937
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:59,970
so much larger, it seemed,
than truth can be."

"Turn the telescope
around," he tells us,

"and wonder why what
was so large

becomes so small again."

941
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,955
As the 20th century dammed,

942
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,459
the African American people
could only ask themselves,

943

"Where has all
our freedom gone?"

00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,467
facing the bitter irony
of winning their freedom in war,

945
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,470
only to lose their rights
under the law.

the strength for a new fight?

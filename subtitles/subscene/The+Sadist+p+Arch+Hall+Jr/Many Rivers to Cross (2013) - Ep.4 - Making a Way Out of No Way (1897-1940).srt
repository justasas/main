00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:14,474

From these shores, millions

GATES: With "separate but
equal" the law of the land,

60
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:41,316
enforcing segregation could
be a brutal enterprise.

61
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,686
Consequently, many African
Americans were beginning to

62
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,692
look for a way out
of the South.

63
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:00,201
Starting in the 1890s, African
Americans began to migrate

64
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,241
north and west--

65
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,709
first as a trickle,
then as a ﬂood.

66
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,615
It would come to be known as
the Great Migration, and it

67
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,245
would last for
generations to come.

68
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:19,485
By the time it ended, it would
arguably be the largest exodus

69
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,756
of people in American history.

70
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,765
But it began with a
slow stream of pioneers.

71
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,994
What was happening in
the South that made

72
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,626
the migration occur?

73
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:34,366
The late 19th century,
that was a period of time when

74
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,772
things were getting pretty
tough in the South, and anyone

75
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:42,748
who had a political
opinion, expressed it,
really had to leave.

That's at the core
of it, isn't it?

84
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,074
Of course, with the Great
Migration, there was also

85
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,341
another opportunity for
self-realization, to find

86
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,851
themselves, to get the
boot off their neck.

87
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:23,844
GATES: The boot on the neck of
African Americans belonged to

88
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:29,088
Jim Crow, the set of legal
and extra-legal measures that

89
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,790
tried to keep them
thoroughly in their place.

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,925
WOMAN: From the moment they
woke up until the moment they

91
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:41,565
went to sleep, every aspect
of their lives was controlled

92
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:44,474
and determined by an
artificial hierarchy that

93
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:48,947
replicated aspects
of enslavement.

94
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:54,476
There were Black and White
bibles to swear to tell

95
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,044
the truth on in court.

96
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,114
It was actually against the
law for Black people and White

97
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,660
people to even play
checkers together.

98
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,196
And that had an overlay over
every single thing that they

99
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,323
could do and everything
that they could imagine
themselves being.

100
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,099
GATES: Jim Crow was not just a
system of laws excluding Black

101
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,768
people from public
accommodations; it was a code

102
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,473
of conduct that relegated
African Americans to

103
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,777
second-class citizenship.

104
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,549

106
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,315
Your eyes were never to gaze
directly into those

107
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,658
of a White person.

108
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,856
Perish the thought that
any eye contact

109
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,399
with a female occur.

110
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,698
This was the policing
of a population.

111
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:50,539
Life was one of
saturated oppression.

112
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,977
GATES: Lynchings were fast
becoming the weapon of choice

113
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:58,176
for enforcing Jim Crow
and reinforcing the notion

114
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,878
of white supremacy.

115
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,083
By the tum of the century,
as many as 3 lynchings

116
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,253
occurred each week.

117
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:13,492
Some were widely advertised
and drew large crowds,

118
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:16,967

some community 50 miles away

120
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:28,779
from an advertised event
of retribution, a lynching,

121
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:34,411
would pack bags and get on
the buggy and hurry there.

122
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,118
Multiply that 10-fold,
and then you have hundreds

123
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:45,756
of people there to witness,
and indeed, to leave

124
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:49,928
with souvenirs of the ﬂesh
and bone of the victim.

125
00:07:55,875 --> 00:08:00,039
This was a barbarism that
should have placed the South

126
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,443

00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:14,450
and they didn't always
involve a rope and a tree.

00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:23,424
In Memphis, here at a place

To put him out of business,
a mob attacked.

136
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,387
Moss and his partners took
up arms to defend themselves.

137
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,154
When the smoke cleared,
several of the attackers lay

138
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,631
wounded, while Moss and
his defenders were hauled

139
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,431
off to jail.

140
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:02,838
Before long, a lynch mob came,
pulled them from their cells,

141
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,400
and dragged them to
the outskirts of town.

142
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:12,378
There, before a group of local
reporters, Thomas Moss was

143
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:16,979
asked if he had
anything left to say.

144
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:20,617
He answered, "Tell
my people to go west.

145
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,423
There is no justice
for them here."

146
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,495
So this is
where he's buried.
Mm-hmm.

147
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,966
Oh, look.
They put "At Rest."

148
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,468
That's horrible.
"At Rest."

149
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:33,300
it really brings back the
manner of his death,
which was so brutal.

150
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:34,771
They were making
a statement.

151
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,868
They replicated the injuries
of Whites that had been shot

152
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:44,076
in this melee, and the
Whites had been shot, one man

153
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,015
in the eye and
cheek and throat.

154
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,609
And that's how
they shot him?

155
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,018
And that's how they
shot the 3 men.

156
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,487
Oh, that's horrible!
That's terrible.

157
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,955
Yeah, yeah.

158
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:59,759
GATES: The Moss case
attracted the attention
of many African Americans

159
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:02,357
in the South,
largely due to Moss'

160
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,496
friendship with
journalist Ida B. Wells.

161
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:10,064
In a series of provocative
editorials published in her

162
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,634
newspaper, the "Memphis Free
Speech," Wells condemned

163
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:18,013
the Moss killings and the
practice of lynching.

When Ida B. Wells

she doesn't know

00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,045
what she's going to write
about it, but then she

167
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,527
remembers Thomas Moss' last
words, and she decides to say,

168
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:34,089
there's only one thing we
can do: save our nickels
and dimes.

169

00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,273
born into slavery,
became our country's leading

173
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,505
anti-lynching crusader.

174
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,448
Her words en raged her White
neighbors, who destroyed her

175
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,987
newspaper offices.

176
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,218
She was threatened with
lynching if she ever returned

177
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,553
to Memphis.

178
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:03,424
GATES: In this editorial,
she spoke the unspeakable.

GIDDINGS: She spoke
the unspeakable. Talk
about truth to power.

180
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,895
Truth to power.

181
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,831
And the interesting thing
about her, she knew how

182
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,337
explosive it <i>was,</i>
but she was just determined
to follow what

183
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,669
she calls the logic
of lynching to its end.

184
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,607
She said, "The heavens
might fall," but I'm
going to tell

185
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,076
the truth about lynching.

186
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,978
GATES: The truth about
lynching, according to Wells,

187
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,744
was that it was an
"unjustifiable act"

188
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:29,618
of economic jealousy and
sexual anxiety, an instrument

189
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,386
of terror and control.

190
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,895
In the weeks and months
following, thousands of Black

191
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:40,090
people from Memphis joined
the early migration

192
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,497
out of the South.

193
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,162
Their exodus
created a problem.

194
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:51,073
The Southern economy was still
largely agrarian, dependent

195
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:55,978
upon African Americans to do
the jobs no one else wanted

196
00:11:56,048 --> 00:12:00,314
at a wage few
others would accept.

LEWIS: People are leaving the
South, and indeed, curiously

198
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:10,457
enough, there is a pushback
on the part of many Whites

199
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,190
in the South, who say,
"Wait a minute.

200
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:16,030
"We have to calibrate
our bestiality.

201
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,093

WILKERSON:The
interaction between the
former slaveholders

208
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:47,188
and those who had been
enslaved had not changed
fundamentally

209
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,599
when it came to
interpersonal interactions

210
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,603
and the expectations of
how one should behave.

211
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:54,070
And economic
exploitation.

212
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,368
And economic
exploitation.

213
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,533
It's incredible, isn't it?

214
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,803
It was like
a bad marriage.
Yeah.

215
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,648
The Emancipation
Proclamation had not
lived up to its name.

216
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,687
People had not
truly been free.

217
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,915
The Great Migration is
really about freedom.

218
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,548
It's about identity.

219
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:17,262
It's about claiming
one's citizenship,
one's American-ness,

220
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,026
and it's ultimately
about agency.

GATES: While some Black
leaders advocated leaving the

222
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:28,266
South behind, there were other
inﬂuential voices urging

223
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,572
African Americans to resist
the siren song of the North

224
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,170

GATES: Born a slave himself,
Booker T. Washington

226
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,158
believed that former slaves
and their masters

227
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:56,258
shared a common
role in the creation

228
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,166
of the New South--

229
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:01,263
to help transform
it economically.

230
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,605
If the South was ever going
to leave that antebellum

231
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,943
plantation mentality behind,
it would require the mutual

232
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:14,316
cooperation of Black people
and White people alike.

233
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,853
WOMAN: Booker T. Washington

234
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,652
was a very practical man,
because he was a person

235
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,852
who could see
the wand as it is.

236
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,773
He's saying to the
Black people, you don't
need to leave.

237
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,773
You don't need to go North.

238
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,742
You can stay here.

239
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,746
GATES: As a practical man,
Washington argued that

240
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,648
political rights for African
Americans could only be won

241
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,382
from a position of economic
strength and self-sufficiency.

242
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:55,291
WOMAN: He believed that
eventually, White people
would come to realize

243
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,659
the value
of Black workers.

244
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,601
He saw himself as a mediating
figure between the White South

245
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:14,510
and the Black South.

246
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,913
GATES: The product of a
vocational education himself,

247
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:21,817
Washington argued that
by learning a trade,
African Americans

248
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:25,914
would hold the key
to their own advancement.

249
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:30,052
He went on to found the
Tuskegee Institute, which

250
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,963
trained African Americans in
vocational and technical skills

251
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,796
and advocated self-help.

252
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,567
Tuskegee was not alone.

253
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,007
The Negro Women's Club
movement created far-reaching

254
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:49,844
social networks that
promoted racial uplift.

255
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,510
Black churches and benevolent
societies lent money to

256
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,816
entrepreneurs starting
out in business.

257
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,960
A washerwoman named Sarah
Breedlove relied on just
such a network.

258
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,659
After changing her
name to Madam C.J. Walker,

259
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,170
she launched a hair
product company and was hailed

260
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:20,372
as the first self-made female
millionaire, Black or White.

261
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:24,644
Fueled in part by the
hardships of Jim Crow,

262
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,676
<i>these success stories were</i> a
<i>by-product of</i> a <i>system of laws</i>

263
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:33,487
that forced Black people to
live in their own world.

264
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:37,655
Necessity became the
mother of invention.

265
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,723
African Americans made
a way out of no way.

266
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,324
HIGGINBOTHAM: Our

00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:47,168
You know, they didn't say,
we're overwhelmed

and overcome, and
therefore, we will just
turn on ourselves.

269
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,072
They looked to their own
institutions, their churches.

270
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,182
Out of those churches,
they will build schools,

271
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,883
they will build
insurance companies,

272
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,652
they will build banks.

273
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,882

GATES: While Black
land ownership was on the rise

275
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:13,360
and a small Black middle
class was emerging, another,

276
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:19,564
more sinister phenomenon was
taking root to counteract
these gains.

277

293
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,592
But the other thing, and maybe

hardworking, malleable--

indeed, one entrusted one's
children, one's property
to such people.

301

Now of a sudden, the African
American becomes demonized,

319
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,682
It's the normalizing of

00:20:55,387 --> 00:21:00,518
a collection of nearly
500 images of dignified,
well-dressed

341
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:05,723
African American men,
women, and children.

342
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:11,360
LEWIS: Here, these fine images
of African Americans of every

343
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:17,306
color, every shape, every
size, every professional pursuit

344
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:22,643
show graphically
that this is a small nation

345
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:25,274
of people on the march.

346
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,355
GATES: The exhibit was the
brainchild of the leading

347
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:35,792
Black intellectual of
the time, William Edward
Burghardt Du Bois.

348
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,757
Du Bois earned his first
Bachelor degree from

349
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:47,032
Fisk University in
Nashville, Tennessee,
and soon became a leader

350
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:51,838
among the emerging African
American intellectual elite.

351
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,108
LEWIS: There's a wonderful
image of Du Bois arriving

352
00:21:56,181 --> 00:22:01,517
in Pan's in top hat and tails,
looking like the Edwardian

353
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:05,545
man quintessential.

354
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:13,053
He sees 1900 as a wonderful
opportunity to give a counter

355
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,623
narrative to the stereotype
view of the African American

356
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,830
that has really gone global.

357
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,341
GATES: The Paris exhibition
embodied Du Bois' philosophy

358
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,106
about African American
leadership.

359
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,876
Unlike his contemporary
Booker T. Washington,

360
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,974
Du Bois believed
that the masses of former

361
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:37,613
slaves in the South, largely
uneducated, had little chance

362
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,853
of achieving
liberation on their own.

363
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:45,385
They needed to
be shown the way.

364
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,560
HIGGINBOTHAM: How do we
understand how a group

365
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:53,229
of people who are
oppressed rise?

366
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:58,470
There's one idea that says
you need talented leaders,

367
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,171
you need extraordinary,
exceptional, educated--

368
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,615
you know, the highest leaders,
your great thinkers.

369
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:07,675
That was the Talented Tenth.

370
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,881
GATES: Du Bois was the first
African American to earn

371
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:13,652
a doctoral degree
from Harvard.

372
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,455
He believed it was the
responsibility of his

373
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,191
intellectual cohort to
lead the fight

374
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,892
for full citizen ship.

375
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,771
HIGGINBOTHAM: Du Bois told
Black people that they could

376
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,104
not wait to be citizens,
that they were

377
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,508
already on the books.

378
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,409
We have a Constitution.

379
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,677
It was signed and sealed in
blood during that Civil War

380
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,481
and during Reconstruction,
and we were already citizens

381
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,851
of the United States.

382
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,083
You couldn't postpone
fighting for justice.

383
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:51,687
For Du Bois, you comprise
something too great to wait

384
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,425
and to say "one day."

385
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:59,366
GATES: Du Bois waged his
battle for justice

386
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,736
on several fronts.

387
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,605
First, he established the
Niagara Movement, whose

388
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,839
Declaration of Principles
would provide the basis

389
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,143
of the modem civil
rights movement.

390
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:14,151
And then he co-founded the
NAACP, the country's oldest

391
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,155
and largest
civil-rights organization.

392
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:21,192
He also believed that if
African Americans were going

393
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,422
to achieve equal rights,
they had to prove their worth

394
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,329
on the cultural
front, as well,

395
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:31,733
as creators of a unique
artistic tradition.

396
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:36,900
LEWIS: Du Bois was saying that
literature can be an agency

397
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,670
for profound change.

398
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:41,507
I call it civil
rights by copyright.

399
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,072
GATES: Du Bois and his
colleagues aspired to set

400
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,950
in motion a Black literary
movement that would compete

401
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,184
on the highest levels
of New York society.

402
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:57,251
"We just left slavery 40,
50 years ago, and you're

403
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:03,029
"talking about publishing house
contracts with Alfred Knopf

404
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:08,664
and Horace Liveright,
when lynching still goes on?"

405
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,071
"Yes," they said.

406
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:11,665
"Absolutely.

407
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:16,009
We're going to write
ourselves just straight
across this problem."

408
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,414
In 1910, Harlem was
an upper-middle-class

409
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,427
White community, but
by 1925, it was known as

410
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,656
the Mecca of the New Negro.

411
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,693
African Americans came to New
York, just as they did to many

412
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,332
of the great cities of the
North, seeking opportunity.

413
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:49,213
During the first World War,
their numbers swelled when

414
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:54,048
labor shortages made
better-paying jobs
available for migrants.

415
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:56,587
[Bell rings]

416
00:25:56,655 --> 00:26:01,024
Those who came to Harlem found
a place where they were free,

417
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:05,654
for the first time, to express
themselves in ways that seemed

418
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,857
inconceivable before.

419
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,792
WILKERSON: Many of these
people had not been able to

420
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:15,636
pursue their art, had not been
able to pursue the opportunity

421
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:19,336
to become a novelist,
to become a jazz musician.

422
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,811
It simply was not available
and possible for them

423
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,010
in the restricted caste system
that they were consigned to

424
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,574
in the South.

425
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,452
Suddenly, here, in New York,
finally, finally, finally,

426
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,923
we can be the people that
we imagine ourselves to be.

427
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:36,426
[Jazz playing]

428
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:39,930
GATES: It would explode into
one of the most artistically

429
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,399
fertile periods in
African American history.

430
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,401
MAN: The Harlem Renaissance
represents, above all,

431
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,637
Black people, really for the
first time, making a claim

432
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:56,477
on being modem as a people...

433
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,516
to say that we are here,

434
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:01,381
and this is our contribution.

435
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:06,550
GATES: Here, on 136th Street,
in the heart of Harlem,

436
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,288
some of the most talented
newcomers found a temporary home

437
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,957
in a rooming house which
its residents humorously

438
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,466
nicknamed Nigeratti Manor.

439
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,970
EDWARDS: Some of the
people that lived there
included Eric Walrond,

440
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:23,166
the Caribbean novelist
and short-story writer,

441
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,471
Zora Neale Hurston
passed through there,

442
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,773
Langston Hugh es
spent time there.

443
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,474
They all ended up putting
together a kind of salon.

444
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,674
It was right here.

445
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,980
Who invented this
crazy term, "niggerati"?

446
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:37,681
Zora Neale Hurston, playing
with the term "literati"
and saying,

447
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,485
"if they're the literati
downtown, we must be

448
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,081
the niggerati uptown."

449
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,424
GATES: Out of Niggerati
Manor came one of the most

450
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,624
provocative publications
of the renaissance--

451
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:52,659
a literary journal
called "Fire!!"

452
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,762
EDWARDS: In that
single issue of "Fire!!"

453
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,503
the first story in there
is Wallace Thurman's
"Cordelia the Crude."

454
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:00,976
[Both chuckle]

455
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,479
It's about a prostitute.

456
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:09,415
Richard Bruce Nugent's
sexually exploratory vignettes

457
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,082
"Smoke, Lilies and Jade"--

458
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:16,025
in terms of exploring a kind
of queer eroticism, it's one

459
00:28:16,094 --> 00:28:18,028
of the stories in the
renaissance, one of the few,

460
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,688
that does that,
that goes there.

461
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,493
[Jazz music playing]

462
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,570
Harlem came to represent
a kind of oasis

463
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:28,970
of permissibility.

464
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,871
There were things that could
go on in Harlem that could not

465
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,500
go on elsewhere.

466
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:39,611
GATES: Harlem's reputation
spread through out the country.

467
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,347
Outsiders were drawn to
its clubs and cabarets.

468
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:47,380
Races could mingle here in
ways that were illegal in much

469
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,053
of the rest of the country.

470
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,097
EDWARDS: Let's say
you get out of the
show at Connie's Inn

471
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:54,529
or at the Cotton Club.

472
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,863
Something else happens when
you can go to the speakeasy

473

after hours and be sitting
next to an Ethel Waters

474
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,903
or a Duke Ellington.

475
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,941
Were they segregated,
these speakeasies?

476
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,533
They were not segregated.

477
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,546
You had to know where it
was and know how to get in.

478

[Buzzer sounds]

479
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,347
For all of them, you had
to know the code.

480
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,580
So there's one you would
knock 3 times and cough.

481
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,087
Ha ha ha!

482
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:21,592
And if you didn't
cough right, you
weren't gonna get in.

483
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,221
And if you’re thinking
about the attraction
to a White audience,

484
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,095
it's not just the attraction
of seeing what was

485
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:33,729
then American popular music,
the coolest stuff around,

486
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,603
but you also get
a kind of proximity
and everything that

487
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:38,232
goes along with that-

488
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,937
communication, seduction,
various kinds of interaction

489
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,411
that's not always
predictable.

Literally and figuratively.

493
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,380
You're going to be jammed

00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:55,944
of the best potentials that
are inherent in the American

00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,683
conception of democracy...

GATES: Meanwhile, a new
medium was emerging that would

519
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:28,414
revolutionize popular culture
and offer another opportunity

520
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,683
for African Americans
to redefine their image.

521
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:43,458
Before Hollywood was even
Hollywood, Oscar Micheaux,

522
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,560
once a Pullman porter,
became the first Black

523
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,333
in dependent filmmaker.

524
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,237
GATES: Micheaux films--

525
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,299
were they shown in Black
theaters or in White?

526
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,346
Black theaters. I mean,
sometimes White-own ed
theaters,

527
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,871
but as with some of
the others of that period,

528
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:02,181
Micheaux didn't really see
boundaries for himself.

529
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,083
GATES: Oscar Micheaux managed
to make more than 40 films

530
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,651
in a career that
spanned 4 decades.

531
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,755
What is different about them
than other films coming out?

532
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:18,563
Well, the fact that you are
seeing a whole range of Black

533
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:23,266
characters on the screen,
assertive, articulate,

534
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:28,938
often sophisticated African
American men who are strong

535
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:32,608
characters who are trying to
do something for themselves

536
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:33,912
and the community.

537
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,613
The idea <i>was,</i> there's
a Black audience out
there that wasn't

538
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:43,991
yet begin serviced and wanted
to be entertained and wanted

539
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,758
to learn something as much
as any other audience.

540
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:51,460
GATES: Black audiences would
see new images of themselves

541
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:56,064
on film, many of them
for the first time.

542
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,203
Micheaux's films walked a fine
line between entertainment

543
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,806
and social commentary.

544
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:08,682
Tackling taboo subjects
like miscegenation

545
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,484
and the brutality of rape,
Micheaux chose to articulate

546
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,857
harsh, largely unspoken
truths about black life

547
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:19,328
through his an.

548
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,730
BOGLE: In this film, "Within
Our Gates," there was this

549
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,793
sequence when the leading lady
of the film, she is in a sort

550
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:29,305
of cabin, and there's an
older white man who's

551
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,103
about to rape her.

552
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:37,011
And he goes after her,
and there is a struggle,

553
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:41,142
and somehow her blouse is
ripped open, and <i>she's</i> got

554
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,950
a birthmark, and he realizes
that actually he had

555
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,357
impregnated a black woman
years before, and this
is his daughter.

556
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:50,758
Oh, my God.

557
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:53,695
You know, you think of the
women in the slave cabins

558
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,165
at night, when the White
masters came out and got them.

559
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:57,394
I mean,
all of that is sort

560
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,959
of part of a kind of
subtext in the movie.

561
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,335
Now, this is heavy stuff.

562
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:05,704
GATES: In its portrayal of
the hidden causes of racial

563
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,838
violence, Micheaux's film
was a bold rebuttal to one

564
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:14,874
of the most celebrated and
racist American films ever made,

565
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:16,385
"The Birth of a Nation."

566
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,388
FILM ANNOUNCER:
D.W. Griffith's "Birth
of a Nation."

567
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:22,119
GATES: Released in 1915 to
widespread critical acclaim,

568
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:26,687
"The Birth of a Nation" was
picketed by the NAACP for its

569
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:30,894
vicious portrayals
of African Americans.

570
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,903
BOGLE: In "The Birth of
a Nation," major Black
characters

571
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,836
were played by
Whites in blackface-
Of course.

572
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:39,070
Which made them
all the more grotesque,
and these Black men

573
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,873
lusting after White women.

574
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,177
GATES: With its searing
depiction of black men as

575
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:49,947
sexual predators, "The Birth
of a Nation" helped revive

576
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,286
the Ku Klux Klan, which had
been largely dormant

577
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,881
since Reconstruction.

578
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,954
Organized to defend White
supremacy, the Klan's

579
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:06,197
membership ﬂuctuated over
the decades and tended to peak

580
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,865
when competition for
jobs triggered violence.

581
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,933
On occasion, Klan activities
were fueled by resentment

582
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,479
of a thriving Black
middle class,

583
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,448

accusation ignited
the city of Tulsa.

00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,663
He told me, when he was a
little boy, that something

589
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,834
really bad happened, told me
how he was woken up by his mom

GATES: Young's family lived
in the Black section of town

592
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,952
known as Greenwood, where
black-owned businesses

593
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:03,017
thrived, creating an oasis
at the height of Jim Crow.

594
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:08,225
MAN: In the early pans of
the 20th century in Tulsa,

595
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:11,291
African Americans, they said,
"OK, we have to be separate,

separate but equal is not

We can support
our own industry."

600
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:23,473
And in fact, the black dollar
circulated 26 times before it

601
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,517
left that community, which meant
it went from the barbershop

602
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:31,248

But prosperity for some was
a provocation to others.

He appeals to this sense of
Black pride in a moment in our

679
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,216
history where White
supremacy is riding unbound,

680
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,660
and the response
is phenomenal.

681
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,131
GATES: At its height, Garvey's
organization, the Universal

682
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:24,130
Negro Improvement Association,
was the largest black mass
movement in American history.

683
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:28,406
MAN: Garvey becomes one of
the era's biggest black-
nationalist organizers.

684
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:32,415
He is a fan and admirer of
Booker T. Washington

685
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:35,043
and thinks that
this idea of bootstrapping,

686
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,384
pulling yourself up,
is the way to go.

687
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,424
GATES: <i>The</i> UNIA <i>started its

a printing press that

00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,555
circulated "Negro
Wand" newspaper.

690
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,796
MAN: Garvey has a
messianic vision of himself.

691
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,067
He's going to say that Black
people are worthwhile people.

692
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,734
They've been kings
and queens in Africa.

693
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:03,769
He wants to repatriate to
Africa and establish a colony

694
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:08,113
that's under African American
leadership in Liberia.

695
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,949
GATES: Garvey created a
shipping company called the

696
00:43:11,021 --> 00:43:14,957
Black Star Line to transport
those of his followers who

697
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,483
wanted to move to Africa.

698
00:43:18,562 --> 00:43:22,089
But Garvey's dream was
as leaky as his boats.

699
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:27,364
LEWIS: Turned out to be
a rather unfortunate
acquisition.

700
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:31,306
Those huge tubs leaked,
and their boilers had to be

701
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:34,742
repaired and all that, but for
one gorgeous day, marching

702
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:37,872
down to the Brooklyn pier to
see the "Frederick Douglass"

703
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,381
sail to Africa--

704
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,611
boy, what a charge, that.

705
00:43:44,722 --> 00:43:47,520
GATES: When Garvey mailed
ads for the sale of shares

706
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:52,358
in a ship he did not own,
the FBI used this as an excuse

707
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:56,763
to arrest him on
charges of fraud.

708
00:43:56,834 --> 00:44:00,497
Ultimately, he was tried and
convicted of the charges,

709
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:05,372
sewing nearly 3 years of a
5-year sentence before making

710
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:07,637
one last bargain.

711
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:13,183
[Ship horn blows]

712
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,708
In one of the cruelest ironies
of African American history,

713
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:20,553
President Calvin Coolidge
commuted Garvey's sentence,

714
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:22,524
under one condition--

715
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:27,428
that he would be deported
from right here, at the
port of New Orleans

716
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,662
not back to Africa,
but to his home in Jamaica.

717
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:40,039
On a December day in 1927,
Garvey's most devoted

718
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,943
followers came to
bid him farewell.

719
00:44:47,251 --> 00:44:50,220
JOSEPH: His lasting legacy
is that all blacks who are

720
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,654
descended from Africa, whether
they're in Brazil or Brooklyn,

721
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,693
Harlem or Haiti,
are one people.

722
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:04,496
GATES: As Garvey's ship
sailed away at the height

723
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:07,969
of the Roaring Twenties,
no one could imagine

724
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,701
the devastating economic
downturn that was to come.

725
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,843
During the Great Depression,
African Americans reached new

726
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,753
depths of despair.

727
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,953
Pushed out of the unskilled,
largely menial jobs that they

728
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:34,657
had once held, Black people
saw unemployment rise above

729
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,395
50% in some pans of the
country, twice that

730
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,232
of White Americans.

731
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,936
In the South, searing poverty
made the lie of "separate

732
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,276
but equal" all the more
glaring, especially

733
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,714
in education.

734
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:57,185
At the height of the
depression, a lawyer named

735
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:01,418
Charles Hamilton Houston set
out to expose the inequities

736
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:02,925
of Jim Crow.

737
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,053
SULLIVAN: Charles Hamilton
Houston took a camera and went

738
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,726
into South Carolina and did
a visual documentation

739
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,497
of separate and unequal.

740
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,936
GATES: With this visual
evidence, Houston began

741
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:20,102
building a legal case against
Jim Crow, showing just how

742
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:24,580
unequal education was between
Black and White students

743
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,309
in America.

744
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,614
SULLIVAN: They would
film a Black sch col.

745
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,415
Often, they'd be
in just shacks.

746
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:32,750
I mean,
you know, places that had

747
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,621
cracks in the walls,
and children crowded onto

748
00:46:35,692 --> 00:46:37,557
benches, no desks.

749
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,528
Then he would go to the
White school, neighboring

750
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:40,927
White school--

751
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:45,230
2-story,brick,
basketball courts.

752
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:50,239
So here is this astounding
visual <i>essay,</i> and he used it

753
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:53,299
to inform people around the
country and to help mobilize

754
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,312
Black people to fight for
their children's futures.

755
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,384
GATES: After serving as
a commissioned officer

756
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:05,649
in World War I,
Houston entered law school.

757
00:47:05,722 --> 00:47:09,283
He emerged a soldier
of another kind.

758
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,327
SULLIVAN: While he was in
law school, he developed this

759
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,853
notion about the kind of role
a Black lawyer should play

760
00:47:14,932 --> 00:47:16,957
in the fight for civil rights.

761
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:23,564
He says the Black lawyer is
a soldier, taking the battle

762
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,576
into the courtroom, sewing
as an advisor to the people.

763
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:29,373
The courtroom became the
place where you asserted

764
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:30,879
your citizenship.

765
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:34,475
GATES: As his legal career
ascended, Houston began a slow

766
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:39,682
assault on Jim Crows
"separate but equal" doctrine.

767
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:43,624
SULLIVAN: As Dean at Howard
Law School, he is determined

768
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,323
that he will train the best
constitutional lawyers, and he

769
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,857
imbues in them the power that
they have, and he transforms

770
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,835
the law school.

771
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:57,431
It becomes the West Point of
the civil rights movement.

772
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,271
GATES: Houston and his law
students at Howard University

773
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:03,609
would forge an army of
their own, bringing a series

774
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,343
of cases testing the legality
of "separate but equal"

775
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,510
throughout the South.

776
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:10,951
OGLETREE: American
wasn't 't ready for the en d

777
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:13,489
of segregation when he
started pushing these cases

778
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,115
in the 1930s.

779
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:18,218
As he argued cases before the
Supreme Court, he also noticed

780
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,422
that one justice actually turned
his back on him, wouldn't even

781
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,931
listen to him, because he was
a black man articulating what

782
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,433
it was all about.

783
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,594
At the Supreme Court?
At the Supreme Court.

784
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,262
The justice just turned his
back, didn't want to hear

785
00:48:28,338 --> 00:48:30,670
a black man arguing,
but Charles Houston won

786
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,268
case by case, statute by
statute, section by section,

787
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:39,111
and his whole effort
was to make sure that

788
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,413
the races were treated equal.

789
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,421
GATES: Though he wouldn't live
to argue the case himself,

790
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:50,017
Houston's efforts eventually
led to the landmark 1954

791
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:54,792
Supreme Court
ruling "Brown vs.
Board of Education."

792
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:57,766
The court reached the decision
to overturn segregation

793
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:04,433
in public schools just 4 years
after Houston's death.

794
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:08,740
In the 1930s, however, the
end of segregation was still

795
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,303
decades away.

796
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:15,545
African Americans would have
to find ways to cope with the

797
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:20,113
many challenges posed by Jim
Crow, like where to eat or

798
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:28,097
drink, sleep, stand, or where
to stop and rest after

799
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,793
along drive.

800
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:34,803
The sheer inconvenience and
indignity of it all was enough

801
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:40,400
to overwhelm, so in 1936,
a Harlem postal employee

802
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,741
offered a solution.

803
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:45,509
"The Negro Motorist
Green-Book."

804
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,981
What in the wand was that?

805
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,581
WILKERSON: It was created
by Victor Hugo Green.

806
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,524
Ha ha! My man,
Victor Hugo Green.

807
00:49:57,594 --> 00:49:59,994
So, it was green.
The book was green.

808
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,429
He was Green.
His name was Green.

809
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:09,063
And he set out to create a
listing of where one might go

810
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,802
if you were African American,
and you could be assured

811
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,673
of being able to get service.

812
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:19,079
So in other words,
how not to get arrested
or rebuffed while

813
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,515
you're driving that new
car that Mr. Ford made.

814
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:23,109
Yes.

815
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,053
But it also represented so
much more than just listings.

816
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:30,025
It was insurance
again st indignity.

817
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,291
GATES: With the Great Depression
in their rear view mirror,

818
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,334
Black people were
once again on the move,

819
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:42,031
and the automobile was now
one of the most viable means

820
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:43,538
of transportation.

821
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:51,603
But being on the road was not
such an easy thing back then.

822
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:55,549
Isabel, it's so enormously
complicated and fraught.

823
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,645
What went into a Black
family planning a trip
north in a car?

824
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:03,352
They would need to know,
where is it safe to stop,

825
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:07,625
where would there be
proprietors
that would permit us

826
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:12,464
to have a room for the
night, where we could
get gas.

827
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,595
So we couldn't get gas
at any gas station?

828
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:18,664
You couldn't assume that
you could get anything
from anyplace.

829
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,075
All these things added
to the uncertainties of
being on the road.

830
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:30,244
GATES: By turning the
uncertainties
of the road into something

831
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,222
more reliable, the "Green-Book"
would direct Black travelers

832
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:37,624
to accommodations
like this.

833
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:41,061
WILKERSON: People had to drive
far longer than they otherwise

834
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:44,123
might have because they had
to get to the one place that

835
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,998
might have accepted them.

836
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:49,402
And they found creative
ways to tell the children,

837
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,636
"We don't want to stop there,
anyway," or, "We're gonna go

838
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,734
and wait till we get
to auntie's house."

839
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,642
They cushioned the blow
of reality

840
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,647
of the segregated America.

841
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,977
<i>Yes , yes .</i>

842
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,678
Was this migration one of
the first massive exercises

843
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,812
of free will of the
African American people?

844
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:08,653
Absolutely. In fact, I call
it the overground railroad.

845
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,056
That's a good way to put it.

846
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,062
That this migration was a
first step that the nation's

847
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:16,122
servant class ever
took without asking.

848
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,190
This is the first time
that they made a decision

849
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,668
for themselves as to who
they would be and where they

850
00:52:20,737 --> 00:52:22,204
would be it.

851
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:29,838
GATES: Among other things,
it was indignity that
African Americans

852
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:32,677
were escaping
in the Great Migration-

853
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:36,685
and indeed, throughout
much of their history.

854
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:40,883
Perhaps the "Green-Book"
helped in some small way to

855
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:43,687
reaffirm their humanity.

856
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,456
Another book
certainly did, and it, too,

857
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,260
went with them
on their journey.

858
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:54,201
That book was the Good Book,
the Holy Bible.

859
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:58,105
WILKERSON: It was the
reminder of what was
at stake

860
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,075
when they were going
into these lonely
stretches where

861
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:02,475
there was no guarantee
of what might happen,
and so this is

862
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,911
what carried them through.

863
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,108
"I raise my eyes
toward the mountains.

864
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,277
"From where will
my help come?

865
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,287
My help comes from
the Lord, the maker
of heaven and earth..."

866
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:18,225
GATES: "God will not allow
your foot to slip; your
guardian does not sleep.

867
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:21,731
"By day,
the sun cannot harm you,

868
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:24,426
"nor the moon by night.

869
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:31,100
"The Lord will guard you from
all evil, will always
guard your life.

870
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:36,806
The Lord will guard your
coming and going, both now

871
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,211
and forevermore."

872
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,346
ANNOUNCER: Funding for
"The African Americans:
Many Rivers to Cross"

873
00:53:44,421 --> 00:53:47,879
was made possible by
Senegal, Africa-

874
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,620
The Door of No Return.

875
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:53,993
From these shores, millions
of Africans went across oceans

876
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:58,728
and continents, battlefields,
racial barriers,

877
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:01,396
and constitutional divides.

878
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:05,999
Bank of America is proud to
sponsor "Many Rivers to Cross,"

879
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:10,843
an epic journey
through 500 years of
African American history.

880
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:14,350
We believe connecting to
our past helps us all create

881
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,850
a better future.

882
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,387
Yeah, they have it.

Next time on "The African

MAN: We had one thing in mind,
and that was challenging

910

bigotry and Jim Crow.

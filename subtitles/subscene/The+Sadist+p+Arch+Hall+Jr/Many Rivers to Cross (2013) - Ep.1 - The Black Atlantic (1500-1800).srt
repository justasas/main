HENRY LOUIS GATES, JR.:
I've spent much of my life

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:09,341
Searching for the stories
of the African American people.

3
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:12,071
MAN: Our first notation
of Anthony Johnson

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:16,582
essentially defines him as
"Antonio the Negro."

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:20,176
GATES: I've always wanted
to tell their history:

6
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,721
5 centuries in the making.

7
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,656
It's a living history,

8
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,821
and I've traveled
around the country...

9
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,365
and across the globe
to chronicle it.

00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,798

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,495
Did any of you
receive wealth

12
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,867
inherited from
the slave trade?

13
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,805
GATES: Black people changed
American society.

14
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,669
America probably wouldn't have
much of a popular culture

15
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,305
without black people.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,474
We blackified it.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,711
We took everything
and made it, like,

18
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,718
made it better.

19
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,448
Mmm. You're a good
cook, man.

20
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,548
GATES: Black people redefined
the American dream.

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,389
Robert Smalls

00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,157

the country to its ideals,

24
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,238

From these shores,
millions of Africans

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,552
went across oceans

GATES, VOICE-OVER:
The African American story

74
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,540
begins here,
on the Atlantic Ocean.

75
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,012
Africans crossed these waters

76
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,353
with the very first
European explorers.

77
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,485
And their stories show that
right from the start,

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,961
the black people who came
to this land

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,466
nurtured aspirations
and dreams...

80
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,360
dreams that would never
disappear,

81
00:03:57,437 --> 00:04:01,498
even in the long night
of slavery...

82
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:05,408
dreams that would help them
endure and overcome.

83
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,622
Florida. The first known
African in America

84
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,150
came here with Spanish
explorers in 1513.

85
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,231
His name was Juan Garrido.

86
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,703
He was free, and he left
his mark on the New World.

87
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,070
Garrido helped Cortez
take Mexico.

88
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,077
Then he headed for California,
searching for gold.

89
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,983
20 years later,

90
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,988
a black man struggled to
cross this Texas desert.

91
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,086
He was called Esteban the Moor.

92
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,692
He was one of just 4 survivors
of a Spanish expedition

93
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:04,134
that went horribly wrong.

94
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:08,335
Esteban served as a guide
and a translator

95
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,276
for his companions, negotiating
their way to safety

96
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,940
across this forbidding
landscape.

97
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:20,611
By the year 1536, they had
walked 15,000 miles.

98
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,520
They had seen more of
the North American continent

99
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,253
than any explorers would
until Lewis and Clark.

100
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,920
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
Garrido and Esteban

101
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,126
were among the first Africans
in our country.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,760
They found hope
and opportunity here.

103
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:40,867
But things changed quickly.

104
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:53,541
Jamestown, Virginia--
the first British colony

105
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,077
in what became
the United States.

106
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:02,025
In 1619, this was
the ultimate frontier town,

107
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:06,862
crude fortifications bordering
a muddy malarial swamp.

108
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:11,427
Then one morning in August,
a ship appeared-

109
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,371
the "White Lion."

110
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,241
It was a pirate ship
carrying African slaves.

111
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:24,011
Roughly 20 of them
were traded here for food.

112
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,042
That's how slavery began
in the English colonies.

113
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:34,825
Plantations, as we imagine them,
didn't exist yet.

114
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,660
This was just a fragile outpost
in the wilderness.

115

MAN: Lives in
colonial Virginia

116
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,433
were very precarious.

117
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,634
They were really stuck
at the edge of survival.

118
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,767
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
I've come here,

119
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,437
just a few miles from Jamestown,

120
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,711
to look for traces of a man
named Anthony Johnson,

121
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:03,518
a man whose life shows how
slavery evolved in Virginia.

122
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,853
SWEET: Our first notation
of Anthony Johnson

123
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,086
is from the early Virginia
muster roll,

124
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,355
which essentially
defines him

125
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,953
as Antonio the Negro.

126
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,588
So his blackness
was pan of his name,

127
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,632
his title.

128
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,259
Exactly.

129
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,064
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
Despite his skin color,

130
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:21,595
Johnson found opportunities
in Jamestown.

131
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,234
He worked side by side
with his owner

132
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,041
and forged a bond
based on necessity

133
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,103
SWEET: In order for
the master to survive,

134
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,343
he needed Anthony Johnson.

135
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,214
To make a farm in this
kind of environment,

136
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,878
it was all about
manual labor,

137
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,354
so Anthony Johnson
earned his way

138
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,586
to his own freedom,
and his master actually

139
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
provided him with son of
a start-up, if you will.

140
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,063
He gave him a little
cash, some land?

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,691
Yeah, some land,
it seems. Yes.

142
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:55,038
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
Anthony Johnson soon
began to prosper.

143
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:58,440
He owned a 250-acre
tobacco farm,

144
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,139
he had white indentured
servants,

145
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,809
and he even had an African
slave of his own.

146
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,719
But as Johnson prospered,
so did Virginia.

147
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,726
Within decades, Jamestown
had become the center

148
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,126
of a booming tobacco economy

149
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,926
that was desperate for labor,

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,866
and this transformed slavery

151
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,563
from a loose, informal
arrangement

152
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:29,074
into a rigid racial system,
a system in which

153
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:33,134
a life like Anthony Johnson's
would be inconceivable.

154
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:35,476
SWEET: Johnson's blackness,
his African-ness,

155
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:39,382
these things define him,
mark him as an outsider.

156
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,384
The stigma
of blackness.

157
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:41,442
The stigma
of blackness,

158
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,490
and the fact that
the status was tied

159
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,391
to that observable
trait was one which was
very difficult to surmount.

160
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,487
GATES: After Johnson died,

161
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:55,193
a noun ruled that he
was "a negroe"

162
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,432
and by consequence an "alien."

163
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:04,067
And then the colony of Virginia
seized his family's land.

164
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:14,643
Johnson's story marked a new era
in the British colonies.

165
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,091
From this point on, slavery
would be solely based on race,

166
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,254
and the acquisition of slaves
would be central

167
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,322
to the acquisition of wealth.

168
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,166
In effect, the British were
simply trying to do

169
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,729
what many Europeans
had already done.

170
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,573
By the time Anthony Johnson
arrived in Jamestown

171
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:46,675
in the early 1620s, more than
half a million enslaved Africans

172
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,778
had already been spread
across the New World

173
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:54,155
into Brazil, Mexico,
and the Caribbean.

174
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,686
The free labor of these slaves
was making fortunes

175
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,892
for the Portuguese
and the Spanish.

176
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:05,961
Now the British wanted
to get in on the action.

177
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:07,767

00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,189
By the time
they got here,

352
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,021
they were very
terrified,

353
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,391
and then they were
examined like cattle--

354
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,421
their eyes, teeth-
and then when the slaves
were taken out

355
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,764
to be put on board
the slave ships,

356
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:59,736
they were branded
with the letter "s"
on their left breast

357
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,706
to denote that they
came from Sierra Leone.

358
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,243
GATES: This place
was not unusual.

359
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,651
There were dozens
of forts like this

360
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:20,249
up and down the African coast.

361
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,815
We're not even sure exactly

362
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,886
how many slaves passed
through this island-

363
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:27,989
50,000 at least.

364
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,500
We know the names of a handful

365
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,732
and the stories
of a precious few.

366
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,140
In 1756, a British ship
named the "Hare"

367
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,309
set sail for Charleston

368
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,548
carrying 80 African slaves-.

369
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,454
One of them was
a 10-year-old girl.

370
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,185
We don't know where
she was from.

371
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,420
We don't know
her parents' names.

372
00:19:56,495 --> 00:20:00,795
But we do know the name
that her master gave her:

373
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,731
Priscilla.

00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,219
that would change
her life forever:

382
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,318

00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:48,540
for a contemporary audience.

387
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,249
You have public floggings.

You have decapitation.

[Baby crying]

391
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,024
It is complete loss

in every way possible.

393
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,763
Think about an 8-, a 9-,
a 10-year-old.

394
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,896
It is something that you're
never going to forget,

395
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,236
and it's going to be etched
in your memory.

396
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,006
GATES: Women on the ship, even
girls as young as Priscilla,

397
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,547
faced an added danger:

398
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:28,052
they were completely at
the mercy of the male crew.

399
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,214
MUSTAKEEM: Women were considered
to be available prey

400
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,656
at any given moment
for the entire ship crew

401
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,488
throughout the passage,

402
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,552
so some women would
commit suicide,

403
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,791
and some women did decide that

404
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,266
"I don't want to bring a child
into this world,"

405
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,270
so they inserted some
son of piece of wood

406
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:50,172
or nail or something to,
you know, cause violence

407
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:53,769
upon their body, and you will
also find that some women

408
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:58,544
would actually die
from these attempts.

409
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:03,418
GATES: Priscilla spent
10 weeks on the ship.

410
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:07,549
She saw 13 of her fellow
Africans die along the way,

411
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:11,153
their corpses thrown
into the ocean.

412
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,561
Death was so common
on slave ships

413
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,362
that sharks followed
in their wake,

414
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,836
feasting on the dead bodies.

415
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,964
[Thunder]

416
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,838
As the ship drew close to shore,

417
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:31,405
the slaves were rubbed with
a mixture of gunpowder and oil

418
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,475
to make them look healthier,
hiding the wounds

419
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,886
from their beatings and chains.

00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:41,359

Then Priscilla stepped

422
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,892
Charleston, South Carolina.

423
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,058
This was once the center
of the slave trade

424
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:52,001
in the 13 colonies.

425
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,733
Over 40% of all the slaves
who entered our country

426
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,867
came through this city.

427
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,778
In Priscilla's time, South
Carolina had more black slaves

428
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,215
than white citizens.

429
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,946
In fact, it was called
"Negro country."

on the streets of Charleston

435
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,855
almost every day.

436
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,994
Priscilla was bought
at one of these auctions

437
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,627
by a rice planter
named Elias Ball.

438
00:23:29,307 --> 00:23:31,741
MAN: We're on the way
to the Ball plantation,

439
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,837
which consisted of
1/2 of Comingtee plantation

440
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,644
and about 25 African
American slaves.

441
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,153
GATES, VOICE-OVER: Edward Ball

Priscilla.

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,224
He's brought me to the land

444
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:49,283
where his family ran
rice plantations

445
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,794
for almost two centuries.

446
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,796
...the landlord
with a thousand acres.

447
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:56,732
So this would have
been maybe one little
road running through it.

448
00:23:56,802 --> 00:24:00,363
Yeah. The rice fields
were off the river.

449
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,430
They were
right around here.

450
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,270
GATES, VOICE-OVER: Ball told me
he had spent years

451
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,640
wrestling with
his family's past.

452
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:11,171
Priscilla is just
one of 4,000 people
that they owned.

453
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:14,082
My dad used to talk
about the plantations

454
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:17,883

and all of the--

455
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:23,758
the prosperity
that our family
had lived through,

456
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,662
but he never talked
about the slaves.

457
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,325
He said, "There are
5 things we don't
talk about

458
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,028
"in the Ball family:

459

no parents,
no language, no home.

465
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,298
This was her
introduction

466
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:03,596
to the rest
of her life.

GATES, VOICE-OVER:
Priscilla's new life

468
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:12,976
centered around this house and
the white family that owned it.

00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:17,174
Though a ruin today, the Ball
plantation was once thriving,

470
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,877
thanks to the labor
of its slaves.

471

BALL: The second Elias,
who bought Priscilla,

472
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,350
bought 6 children,
none of them older
than 10.

473
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,687
He liked buying children.

474
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,193
In fact, he wrote
a little memoir

475
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,527
in which he said,
"Due two things
with your money:

476
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:36,260
buy land and buy
young slaves."

477

long-term investment.

479
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,865
The white folks lived here.

480
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,705
The black folks lived
about 1/4 mile away.

481
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:50,646
The rice fields were about
half a mile down that road,

482
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,411
and that's where
all the work

483
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:57,012
of producing the money
took place.

484
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,858
GATES: Rica-that's why
Priscilla was here.

485
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:06,830
Rice fields like these
were making a fortune

486
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,195
for slave-owners.

487
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,867
Don't let their beauty
fool you.

488
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:14,371
These places were death traps.

489
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,173
The swamp ground was
covered with snakes.

490
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:24,648
The tropical air was filled
with malarial mosquitoes.

491
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:27,378
1/3 of South Carolina's slaves

492
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,046
died within a year
of their arrival,

493
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:35,491
and nearly 2/3 of all children
were dead before they turned 16.

494
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:39,288
But Priscilla beat the odds.

495
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:43,027
She and her family survived.

496
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:51,673
BALL: The Balls were
fanatical about
keeping records.

497
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,940
They had books
that listed
the birthdays

498
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,480
of all the slave
children,

499
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:59,881
books that listed
the deaths of all
the slave adults,

500
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,681
and all of this stuff
is collected in an archive

501

00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,607
Oh, man.

526
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,664
Law of the land.

527
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:58,674
They were not
joking.

528
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,735
They were not
kidding around. Yeah.

529
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,441
GATES, VOICE-OVER: As Ball
scanned page after page,

530
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,314
he began to see
one name repeated.

531
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:09,114
Priscilla's 10 years old

532
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,951
when she comes to
Comingtee Plantation,

533
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:16,653
and 10 years later,
she's having
her own children.

534
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,322
Monimia, Priscilla's
daughter, was born,

535
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,490
and Monimia becomes
the matriarch

536
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,591
and her grandchildren
have children.

537
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:26,967
GATES: Ball was able to trace
Priscilla's family tree

538
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,666
down generations,

539
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:34,269
stretching from the 1750s
all the way to today.

540
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:39,674
For an African American,
this is extraordinarily rare.

541
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:42,887
GATES: Now, how are you
related to Priscilla?

542
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:46,082
She is my great-great-
great-great-
great- grandmother:

543
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,715
Through your mother--
Through my father.

544
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,521
My father. Mm-hmm.

GATES, VOICE-OVER:
This is Thomalind Polite.

546
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,998
She and her husband Antoine

547
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,295
are carrying on a family line

548
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:01,600
that began in Sierra Leone
more than 250 years ago.

549
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:05,165
I was 19 years old
when I first found out.

550
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,041
It really hit me like,
"Oh, my gosh."

551
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:12,379
You know, this was my
fifth grandmother. Yeah.

552
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,883
But she had
to be tough.

553
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,716
She had to be.
She had to be.

554
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,519
I got some of that
from her...
[Laughter]

555
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,924
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
Thomalind is remarkably lucky.

556
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:27,931
She actually knows the name of
her original African ancestor.

557
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,990
I don't know anyone else
who can do this.

558
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,630
For nearly all
African Americans, including me,

559
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,867
our original ancestors
will remain

560
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,136
forever anonymous and invisible.

561
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,271
This was not an accident.

562
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,476
VINCENT BROWN: Removing people
from genealogy

563
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,850
is very important
to making a slave.

564
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,481
So, if I only call you
by your first name

565
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,457
and never by a family name,

566
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,586
I'm indicating
to everybody, right,

567
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,027
that you have no family.

568
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,462
Right? You're just Jimmy.

569
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:04,332
You're just Sam.
You’re just Sarah, right?

570
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,597
So, they'll occupy a station
that everybody will

571
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,307
publicly recognize is at
the lowest rung of society.

572
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:10,672
Publicly recognize is at
the lowest rung of society.

573
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,871
GATES: Masters
worked methodically

574
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,572
to erase the identities
of their slaves

575
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,343
so that they would
be more productive.

576
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,112
And these tactics
were quite effective.

577
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:23,552
Slaves built this country.

578
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,289
They built roads and bridges,

579
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,355
factories and farms,

580
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,264
towns and cities,

581
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,803
but they built
something else as well,

582
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:44,240
something all their own--
a culture.

583
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,971
SWEET: As much as slave masters
tried to control

584
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,672
the worlds of their slaves,

585
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:50,737
they were vastly unsuccessful.

586
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:55,115
There was a persistence in
history and culture and names

587
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,416
that went across the Atlantic

588
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:00,480
despite the best efforts
of Europeans.

589
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,959
We tend to assume that
the slave is a cipher, right,

590
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,758
because that's ideology,
that's the ideology of slavery.

591
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:09,732
That the slave is simply an
extension of the master's will.

592
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,031
That's the plan,
that's the idea,

593
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:15,004
but that's not really what you
can ever do to a human being.

594
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,064
Human beings always find a way

595
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:19,405
to assert
their own prerogatives.

596
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:23,538
So, black people create
new kinds of cultural patterns

597
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:27,949
they didn't obtain in Africa
that weren't those of the whites

598
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,112
but were something new
in the Americas.

Even today, we can try to access

to show how slaves from
different pans of Africa

617

crafted a distinct
African American cuisine.

618
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,032
So, you get a taste.

00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,268
Hominy or mush,
ash cakes,
hoecakes, at cetera,

00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:24,933
would have been the
staple of your diet.

How about some Hoppin' John?
Oh, you gotta
have that.

Mm. You're

in a vast

among their white masters.

643
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,153
It amazed me,
one reference

644
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,487
was one of the
former governors
of Virginia,

645
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,619
his wife said that
no one bakes a ham

646
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:19,629
better than a big,
fat Negro mammy.

647
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:22,188
Oh, really?
And you think
about this.

648
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,201
Ham as a food
was not invented
in Africa.

649
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,066
No.
But somehow,

650
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,901
we got our hands
on the sugarcane.

651
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:30,338
And our ancestors
blackified it.

652
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:31,534
We blackified it.
We took--

653
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,043
we took everything
and made it, like,

654
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,807
made it better
and made it--

655
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,472
made it
more soulful,
if you will.

656
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,448
Said, "Let's put
a little pineapple,
cherries on there..."

657
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,644
Exactly,
and brown sugar.

658
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:43,516
Now, you know, maple
syrup, we don't
do maple syrup.

659
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:45,215
Excuse me.
Brown sugar, brown sugar.

660
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:46,984
And it's
a Creolization process.

661
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:48,650
So, while the okra soup

662
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,990

and the Hoppin' John

663
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,188
and the red rice
and jambalaya

664
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,252
And gumbo,
blah blah blah,

665
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,856

666
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,993
those cooks are bringing
European western dishes

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,298
into the slave quarters.

668
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,702
The ﬂow is going
both ways.

669
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,400
The ﬂow is going
both ways,

670
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,964
and what we have
to recognize is

671
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,011
everybody puts
their stamp on it.

So were ideas.

675
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,351
Ideas about music,
dance, religion.

676
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,655
But especially
ideas about freedom,

677
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:26,823
even if the masters
wished otherwise.

678

GORDON-REED: Black people
knew they were people,

679
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:30,258
whether whites
thought it or not.

680
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:32,598
They knew they were people,
and so if you hear words about

681
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,230
liberty and freedom,
things that they wanted,

682
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:39,276
of course they would think
it would apply to them.

683
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,939
GATES: St. Augustine, Florida.

684
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:46,143
This is the oldest city

685
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,186
Built by the Spanish

686
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:54,316

continuously until 1821.

687
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:01,598
This beautiful place has special
meaning for African Americans.

688
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,691
Because as slavery's
grip tightened

689
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,292
in the British colonies,

690
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,032
Spain declared that runaway
slaves could come here

691
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,734
and be free.

692
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,935
Why? Politics.

693
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,973
Colonial Spain was locked
in a ferocious rivalry

694
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,814
with colonial England.

695
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,049
So, they welcomed
any fugitive slaves

696
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,216

to Catholicism,

697
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,782
swear loyalty
to the Spanish crown,

698
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,954
and serve in
the colonial militia.

699
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,223
Suddenly, slaves
in the British colonies

700
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,202
Simply had to make it
across the St. Mary's River

701
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,934
into Spanish Florida,
and they would be free.

702
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,341
LAN DE RS: They knew
the geopolitics
of the region,

703
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:50,380
that the English
and the Spaniards
were enemies.

704
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,508
Enemy of my enemy
is my friend
son of thing.

705
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:56,815
And we often find
that they get
their information

706
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,583
from the Indian groups,
Hmm.

707
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,146
Who have gone
back and forth.

708
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:01,748
So, the Indians say,
"Hey, you black people,

709
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,384
"if you get on the boat
you get down to a place

710
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,395
called St. Augustine,
you'll be cool,
you'll be free."

711
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,555
Well, they wouldn't
have known that,

712
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,360
but they'd have known
where St. Augustine was

713
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,524
and they would've known

714
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,727
the Spaniards and the
English were at war.

715
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,269
Mm-hmm.
That the Spaniards

716
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,328
didn't like the English
being there,

717
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,897
and they took their
lives in their hands.

718
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,205
Mm-hmm.
They get in a boat
and they make it.

719
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,615
GATES: Soon, there were so many
black people in St. Augustine

720
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,017
that the Spanish built them
their own town,

721
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,318
called Fort Mose, just a few
miles to the north.

722
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,190
Nothing remains of Fort Mose.

723
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,394
It is sunk entirely into the
swamps of the Atlantic coast.

724
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,462
But this was the first
all-black settlement

725
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,405
in what would become
the United States.

726
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,375
An outpost of freedom
in a slave land.

727
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,412
GATES, VOICE-OVER:
I'm trying to imagine

728
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:00,143
what it must have felt like

729
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,312
to arrive here after traveling

730
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,517
through swamps, across rivers,

731
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,617
and through the wilderness,

732
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:13,425
finally gaining your freedom
at Fort Mose.

733
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:19,232
Slavery breeds dreams of freedom
in every human breast.

734
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,830
African American culture
is full of references to

735
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:29,005
the day of jubilee, to making it
to the promised land.

736
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:33,016
Well, for African slaves,
Fort Mose was the promised land,

737
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,518
and crossing St. Mary's River,

738
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,918
well, that was like
crossing the River Jordan.

739
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,316
So many slaves tried to run here

740
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:45,123
that the British started
executing them in public

741
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,424
to stanch the flow.

742
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,863
But even that
couldn't stop them.

743
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,203
300 miles north of Fort Mose,

744
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,177
just outside of Charleston,

745
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:02,837
runs the Stono River.

746
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:07,310
When word of the fort
reached this place,

747
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,979
it inspired one of
the biggest slave revolts

748
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,022
in the history of
the British colonies.

749
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,623
It all started right here-

750
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:20,823
the site of what was
once a general store

751
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,422
called Hutchinson's.

752
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,695
[Rattling]

753
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:29,035
Sunday morning,
September 9, 1739.

754
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:32,269
Hutchinson's Store
had been looted.

755
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,176
Its guns and ammunition
had been stolen.

756
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,340
Two shopkeepers lay dead,
their severed heads lying

757
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,078
on the steps of the store.

758
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:46,112
Plantations on either side
of the river were burning.

759
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,650
An army was on the move-
an African army.

760
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,226
They were headed for Fort Mose.

761
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:02,064
They set out before dawn,
a group of roughly 20 men.

762
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,731
Their tactics were simple.

763
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:06,003
They surrounded plantations,

764
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,544
then burned them to the ground.

765
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:12,080
The ringleaders came from
the kingdom of Congo,

766
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:15,050
a powerful African state.

767
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,112
Some had military training,
and they had a plan.

768
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:23,592
POWERS: The slaves marched
over to Pon Pon Road,

769
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,892
which was a road that,
if you took it south,

770
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:29,194
it would take you
down into Georgia,

771
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,824
down into Savannah,

772
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,927
and ultimately all the way
down to Florida.

773
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:35,904
[Drumbeat]

774
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,142
They were beating drums.

775
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,078
Now, the beating of the drums
is terribly important, because

776
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,581
that shows us that
they were attempting

777
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,880
to draw other Africans
into their midst.

778
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,214
GATES: By afternoon,

779
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:54,621
the rebel army had grown
to nearly 100,

780
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:57,183
and they kept moving south,

781
00:39:57,261 --> 00:39:59,821
along what today
is this highway,

782
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,889
which still leads
from South Carolina to Florida.

783
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,167
But they didn't make it.

784
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,471
Just 20 miles
outside of Charleston,

785
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,240
an armed militia
caught up with them

786
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,680
in a clearing in these woods.

787
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:23,117
The survivors faced
a gruesome fate.

788
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,021
POWERS: A number of
the people who were--

789
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,252
were captured,

790
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,520
they'd be beheaded.

791
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,721
Beheaded.
They would be beheaded

792
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,028
by the militiamen,

793
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:40,196
and as was
a usual practice

794
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,704
during the time period,

795
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,731
their severed heads were
placed on top of posts

796
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,675
along the highway.

797
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,372
So, right along here,
Yeah.

798
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,142
We would've
seen the heads
Yes.

799
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,183
Of these rebels.
Yes. That's right.

800
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,650
And that was meant
to instill fear.

801
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:59,348
Mm.
And to teach
a lesson

802
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,890
to all who observe

803
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,392
to try to
discourage people

804
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,827
from-from
rebelling.

805
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,263
This must have been
the planters
worst nightmare.

806
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,028
It was. Absolutely.

807
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:12,227
Worse than
the worst thing.

808
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,864
They couldn't imagine
that these Congo Africans

809
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,965
knew anything about
guns and ammunition.

810
00:41:18,042 --> 00:41:19,805
That's right.
That's right
That's right.

811
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:21,970
Absolutely right.
This was

812
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:25,709
the worst
insurrection
to occur

813
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,877
in 18th-century
British

814
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,682
colonial
North America.
Huh.

815
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,320
GATES: In the wake
of the rebellion,

816
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:38,953
South Carolina imposed
harsh new slave laws.

817
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,122
They banned drumming
and literacy,

818
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:43,894
and set drastic punishments
on runaways.

819
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,934
But no laws ever
could force the slaves

820
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,598
to accept their fates.

821
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:01,510
Slaves plotted revolts
all over the Atlantic world.

822
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:07,451
In Jamaica, in Virginia,
Barbados and Georgia,

823
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,992
even in New York City.

824
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,891
Most of them failed.

825
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:16,430
But that didn't stop
the slaves from trying.

826
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,869
They were always searching
for a chance at freedom.

827
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:25,042
And as time passed, freedom
seemed to be drawing near.

828
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:25,531
And as time passed, freedom
seemed to be drawing near.

829
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,778
The American Revolution brought
immense hope to the slaves.

830
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:38,015
They heard the patriots
talk of liberty and equality,

831
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,784
and it ignited their own dreams.

832
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,760
But for the most pan,
those dreams were ignored.

833
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,530
Even the greatest
champion of freedom

834
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:51,067
was hesitant to extend it
to black people.

835
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:59,164
This is Mount Vernon,
George Washington's estate.

836
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,407
For so many of us, an icon of
American independence.

837
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,472
But for more than
100 African Americans,

838
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,279
this was a plantation,

839
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,981
where from sunup to sundown,
they toiled as slaves.

840
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,656
The father of our country
was also one of its

841
00:43:20,731 --> 00:43:22,596
largest slave owners.

842
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:26,969
Slaves tended his fields

843
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,301
and watched over his every need.

844
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,699
One worked in these stables,

845
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,507
a groomsman named
Harry Washington.

846
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,480
Harry heard the talk
around Mount Vernon

847
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:40,813
about liberty and independence,

848
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:44,445
but he sensed it wasn't
meant for slaves.

849
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,614
So, like many black people,

850
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:50,854
he decided to take his chances
with the British.

851
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,194
Once the war comes, there are
enslaved men and women saying,

852
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,529
"Hey, we'd love to help you out

853
00:43:57,601 --> 00:43:59,831
"if you would help us out.

854
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,839
"We'd be happy
to help you suppress

855
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:06,603
"this rebellion in Massachusetts

856
00:44:06,677 --> 00:44:10,135
if you will grant
our freedom in return."

857
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:12,045
GATES: Harry joined
a loyalist regiment

858
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:13,981
called the Black Pioneers,

859
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,645
and he wasn't the only one.

860
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,316
Roughly 20,000 slaves
ran away to the British lines,

861
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,952
far more than joined
the patriot cause.

862
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,623
There were a lot of Harry
Washingtons in the British army.

863
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:30,462
In fact, it's probably
fair to say that especially

864
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:32,092
in the southern colonies,

865
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,262
the British army effort
could not have been

866
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,397
as successful as it was
for a time

867
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,805
without the assistance
of former slaves-.

868
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,146
GATES: Unfortunately, most of
these black loyalists

869
00:44:43,213 --> 00:44:45,511
were ravaged by the war.

870
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:47,243
GORDON-REED: Many of them died.

871
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,309
Many of them
contracted smallpox.

872
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:52,252
They met terrible fates,
many of them,

873
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,347
but you can understand
why they opted for it.

874
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,859
That gives you a measure
of what slavery was like,

875
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,861
that people would take
that kind of risk.

876
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:05,232
GATES: Harry Washington
was one of the lucky few.

877
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,133
In the waning days of the war,

878
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,933
the British put him on a ship

879
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,837
and evacuated him to Canada.

880
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:14,203
GORDON-REED: The British
definitely wanted to use

881
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:18,146
the black to help them in their
struggle against the colonists,

882
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,183
but they did not want to--

883
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,184
had no intention of
actually making them,

884
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,413
you know, equal to them

885
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,580
and bringing them
and making them

886
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,886
pan of British society, so,

887
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,859
dropped them off there
and let them make their way.

888
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:35,461
GATES: Harry didn't
stay long in Canada.

889
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,529
He and his fellow
black loyalists

890
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:43,904
were barred from voting
and exploited by local whites.

891
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,966
So, when the British set up
a colony for former slaves

892
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:49,035
back in Sierra Leone,

893
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,513
Harry was among
the first to emigrate.

894
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:55,983
He ended up near here,

895
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:57,918
one of the very few slaves

896
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,785
who ever made it back to Africa.

897
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,222
Harry didn't necessarily
want to go back to Africa.

898
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,265
You know what Harry wanted?
He wanted his old master

899
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,733
George wanted-freedom.

900
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:14,396
The right to do as he pleased.

901
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,770
Unfortunately, he did not
find it here.

902
00:46:20,544 --> 00:46:22,808
The British government
in Sierra Leone

903
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,816
tried to limit the property
rights of the black settlers.

904
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:31,014
Harry fought back and was
banished for insubordination.

905
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,783
After that, he disappeared.

906
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:38,886
Harry was a rebel to the end,

907
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,489
and it's probably best that
he turned his back on America,

908
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:45,228
because he wouldn't have liked
what America became.

909
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:56,710
The founding fathers built
a country committed to slavery.

910
00:46:58,048 --> 00:47:02,485
The site of Washington, DC
was chosen as our capital

911
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:06,990
in order to appease southern
slave owners, and why not?

912
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:10,584
They held an enormous
amount of power.

913
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,822
CHRISTOPHER BROWN: None of it
exists without slavery.

914
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,158
There are no settlements.

915
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,392
There is no 13 colonies
without slavery.

916
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,058
There is no United States
without slavery.

917
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,002
There's no independence movement
without slavery.

918
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,734
The whole thing is
built upon slavery.

919
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:26,002
That's why they didn't
abolish it.

920
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:30,343
GATES, VOICE-OVER: Slavery was
a part of American society

921
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,245
from the very beginning.

922
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:34,511
When the Declaration of
Independence was signed,

923
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:38,578
slavery was legal in each
of the 13 colonies.

924
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:42,091
And take this building here-
our magnificent Capitol.

925
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,686
Slaves quarried and cut
its oldest stones.

926
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,892
Its innermost bricks
were laid by slaves.

927
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,027
And you see the statue of
the Native American on top?

928
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,764
Symbol of freedom?

929
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,739
One of the people who cast it
was a slave.

930
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,309
But even if the ideals
of the American Revolution

931
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,507
were perverted by slavery,

932
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,710
the ideals themselves endured.

933
00:48:08,785 --> 00:48:11,618
They lingered in the hearts
of black people

934
00:48:11,688 --> 00:48:14,555
and they spread throughout
the Atlantic world.

935
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:25,232
Saint-Domingue. At the close
of the American Revolution,

936
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,031
this was a French colony.

937
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,366
It was the world's largest
producer of coffee and sugar.

938
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:36,543
And it had the largest
concentration of slaves

939
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,047
in the Western Hemisphere.

940
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:43,018
Almost twice as many Africans
were brought here

941
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:46,817
as were brought to
the entire United States.

942
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,758
In essence, this was
the epicenter of slavery

943
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:51,851
in the New World.

944
00:48:54,798 --> 00:49:00,327
But in August of 1791,
this colony began to collapse

945
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:04,397
as the slaves rose up against
their hated masters.

946
00:49:08,712 --> 00:49:12,876
Inspired by the same ideals
as the American patriots,

947
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:18,149
they fought off European armies
and founded a new nation--

948
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:22,817
Haiti, the world's first
black republic.

949
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:27,421
Never before in history had
slaves overthrown their masters.

950
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,662
The Haitian Revolution
becomes this

951
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,167
great beacon of
hope, right,

952
00:49:32,235 --> 00:49:33,202
for what's possible.

953
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,137
Another world is possible
Slavery can end.

954
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:39,505
How in the world would a slave,
completely illiterate,

955
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:41,271
stuck on a plantation,

956
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,778
hear about
the Haitian Revolution?

957
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,711
Well, illiterate doesn't
mean ignorant, right?

958
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:46,578
That's the first thing
we have to understand.

959
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,050
Which is that news is
traveling all around

960
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,746
aboard ships, right?

961
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,847
So, sailors,
they're spreading news
about what's going on,

962
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:56,358
and then the slaves
hear ideas about

963
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:59,793
freedom and equality
and liberty

964
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:02,627
that are
incredibly important
to black people.

965
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,725
And so they raise hopes
to an extremely
high level.

966
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:10,298
GATES: Unfortunately, here in
the United States,

967
00:50:10,374 --> 00:50:12,604
those hopes were dashed.

968
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:15,804
African Americans had to wait
almost a century

969
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:17,847
for their freedom.

970
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,317
But even so, Haiti had
a profound impact.

971
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,820
For generation after generation,

972
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:28,722
Haiti was a source
of immense pride.

973
00:50:28,792 --> 00:50:31,886
A free black nation
in a world that thought

974
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:36,126
black people were fit
only to be slaves.

975
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,032
That pride can still
be seen today,

976
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:40,865
if you know where to look.

977
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,641
[Drumbeat]

978
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,377
These men are pan
of a celebration

979
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,714
that stretches back
almost two centuries,

980
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,812
a celebration of our living
connection to Haiti.

981
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:04,784
They get up before dawn
on Mardi Gras morning

982
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:06,954
and parade through New Orleans,

983
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,430
waking the city to celebrate

984
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,831
with a Haitian vodooan tradition.

985
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,699
MAN: Enjoy your life.
SECOND MAN: I can dig that.

986
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,533
You never know--you might
not wake up tomorrow.

987
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:17,197
That's right.
So, they make sure that

988
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,003
everybody wake up
on Mardi Gras Day.

989
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,270
If they don't wake up,
they're dead.

990
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,605
If they don't wake
up, they're dead.

991
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:23,168
[Laughs]
That's the message.

992
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,406
If you don't wake
up, you're dead.

993
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:25,971
Ha ha ha!
That's their job,

994
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:27,209
to wake everybody up
and make sure

995
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,411
that you enjoy
Mardi Gras.

996
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,751
GATES: They've been doing this
since 1819,

997
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,485
soon after a group
of Haitian refugees

998
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,823
came to New Orleans via Cuba

999
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:39,953
and started the tradition.

1000
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:43,488
It's one of the oldest
parts of Mardi Gras,

1001
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:47,003
and a living reminder that
African American history

1002
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,836
isn't limited to the story
of the United States.

1003
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:53,102
It's pan of a much
wider history--

1004
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:56,202
the history of a people
scattered like sand

1005
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,110
throughout the Atlantic world.

1006
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:01,173
VINCENT BROWN: The way
we think of history

1007
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,616
is in national terms,

1008
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,449
so, U.S. history is
U.S. history

1009
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:06,614
and it's discrete
from Jamaican history

1010
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,921
or Haitian history or
British history or
French history.

1011
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:12,120
And it turns out
that national history

1012
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:15,426
really emerges in these
Atlantic cross-currents,
right?

1013
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:18,263
That involve Africa,
the Caribbean,

1014
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:21,202
South America, Europe,
and North America.

GATES: Less than a mile
from the Mardi Gras parades

1025
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,373
runs the mighty
Mississippi River.

1026
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,813
In the decades after
the Haitian revolution,

1027
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:09,374
this river became
the sight and symbol

1028
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,250
of a new phase
in American slavery-

1029
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,950
the violent rise
of the deep South.

1030
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:19,292
But the memory of Haiti
was never forgotten.

1031
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,925
It was mixed into the fabric
of African American culture.

1032
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:28,903
It became an inspiration
for countless numbers
of black people

1033
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,906
who dared to dream
of their freedom.

1034
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,471
They would need that inspiration

1035
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,069
in the harsh and dreadful
years to come.

1036
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:43,078
ANNOUNCER: Funding for
"The African Americans:

1037

was provided by...

1038
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:50,886
Senegal, Africa--
the door of no return.

1039
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,122
From these shores,
millions of Africans

1040
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:56,063
went across oceans
and continents,

1041
00:53:56,132 --> 00:54:02,401
battlefields, racial barriers,

1
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,755
The winter of 1938

2
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:24,288
was one year before the beginning
of the Second World War,

3
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:29,735
and Paris was still an island of light
in the darkness of Europe.

4
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:34,138
And everywhere, men saw
the new European citizen...

5
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:36,733
the refugee.

6
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,108
And on the streets,

7
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:43,139
political refugees rubbed shoulders
with the refugees from life.

8
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:47,915
And no one cared
if these men and women lived or died.

9
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:51,185
So history prepared the end of an era

10
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,250
and the beginning of our times.

11
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,742
Your friend's escaped.

12
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,078
Halt!

13
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,412
Sybil Fildorf.

14
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,685
She had nothing to do with it.

15
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:21,845
Sybil Fildorf.

16
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,218
Was never in my confidence.

17
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:25,756
- Sybil Fildorf.
- I scarcely know her.

18
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,314
Sybil Fildorf!

19
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,112
- What happened on the road?
- I don't know.

20
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:31,721
You don't know, you don't know.
Tell me what you know.

21
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,855
She knows nothing.
There is nothing to know.

22
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,593
She will know.

23
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,033
Crack.

24
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:39,433
- You know.
- I don't know.

25
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,136
Yes.

26
00:05:42,207 --> 00:05:45,369
<i>Oziri zigarette.
They're gold-tipped.</i>

27
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:51,579
You have given us unnecessary trouble.

28
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:04,557
<i>Ja, she's dead.</i>

29
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:06,424
You're quite right.
She did not know.

30
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,158
Is a pity.

31
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,221
My apologies.

32
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:27,307
Your bill, sir.

33
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:28,713
Certainly.

34
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:56,938
This raid,

35
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:59,377
the police pick up this fellow Polyanski

36
00:06:59,446 --> 00:07:00,845
in some bistro.

37
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:02,711
He told them where he lived.

38
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:04,079
Did they catch anyone else?

39
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,412
No, no, no, no.

40
00:07:05,485 --> 00:07:09,080
Madam Favier was able to get them
all down to the cellar.

41
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:13,916
Ah, good evening, Colonel.
Dr. Ravic.

42
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,392
Good evening.

43
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:17,224
Good evening.

44
00:07:17,297 --> 00:07:19,128
Let us play game of billiards, eh?

45
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:22,030
Police will probably be
busy upstairs for some time.

46
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,328
All right.

47
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,960
- Name?
- Mueller.

48
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,629
You keep out of this.

49
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:27,967
Name?

50
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,803
Polyanski.

51
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,467
Vladislav Polyanski?

52
00:07:31,543 --> 00:07:33,807
Didn't you know this man had no papers?

53
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,744
I wasn't on the desk when he registered.

54
00:07:35,814 --> 00:07:38,180
Alois, if you ever let another person
register without papers...

55
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,911
Never mind that.

56
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:41,815
This isn't your first offense.

57
00:07:41,886 --> 00:07:43,183
I'm sorry, but this time,

58
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,484
you'll get six months
before we deport you.

59
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,887
Next time, it'll be worse.

60
00:07:46,958 --> 00:07:48,118
It's the law.

61
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:51,491
I saw Haake.

62
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:52,824
Again?

63
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:54,159
Uh, are you sure?

64
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,131
Yes.

65
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,462
Did he see you?

66
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:58,559
No.

67
00:07:58,636 --> 00:08:00,364
Do you think he would recognize you

68
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,995
if he did see you?

69
00:08:02,072 --> 00:08:03,061
He thinks I'm dead.

70
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,835
Lucky for your friends at home.

71
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:08,901
He recognized Krauss.

72
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:11,379
Krauss has no friends left.

73
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:12,938
Ghosts.

74
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:15,280
I thought I would be over this by now.

75
00:08:15,352 --> 00:08:17,513
Eh. One never is.

76
00:08:17,587 --> 00:08:21,147
I am still waiting
for three Franco Spaniards.

77
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,918
That's my dream.

78
00:08:24,593 --> 00:08:27,585
Everybody in this room has his dream.

79
00:08:29,365 --> 00:08:31,833
Rappaport, over there,

80
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,666
he dreams they are pulling out
his fingernails again.

81
00:08:35,738 --> 00:08:38,331
Krings dreams they are chasing him down

82
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:39,668
<i>Unter der Linden.</i>

83
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,904
He runs and runs,
but they always catch him.

84
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,969
Schultz,

85
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:48,948
his friends call him The Bird of Death.

86
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:52,681
He dreams of the next disaster.

87
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:56,383
He left Berlin two weeks
before Hitler came to power.

88
00:08:56,457 --> 00:09:00,119
He left Vienna three days
before the Nazis came in.

89
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:05,730
My dream is Sybil's face

90
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:07,858
after they had finished with her.

91
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,368
She couldn't tell them anything
because she knew nothing.

92
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,802
She was not in my confidence.

93
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:14,898
She meant no more to me
than a beautiful painting.

94
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:17,408
They expected her to crack,
but she didn't crack.

95
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:20,206
She let them kill her,
right before my eyes.

96
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,541
Haake killed her.

97
00:09:21,614 --> 00:09:24,082
She had a world of courage,
but no great strength.

98
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,744
She lasted a very little while.

99
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:28,753
You will have your revenge, Ravic.

100
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,584
These crimes cannot go unpunished.

101
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,857
Revenge? No, not revenge.

102
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:37,918
Revenge is a personal thing.
This is something bigger.

103
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:42,592
Sybil's face is now the symbol
of thousands of beaten faces.

104
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,601
Haake must never leave France.

105
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:48,503
Each time he returns to Berlin,
innocent people die.

106
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,734
By the hundreds, they die.

107
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,766
Let me go.

108
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,271
Let me go.

109
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,942
Go where?

110
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,345
Leave me alone.

111
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,441
You're not well.

112
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:39,351
Let me get you a cab
and send you home.

113
00:10:45,093 --> 00:10:46,185
What?

114
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:47,626
Did you hear me?

115
00:10:47,696 --> 00:10:51,257
I said I'll put you in a cab and send you
to your apartment, your hotel.

116
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,594
Hotel?

117
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:53,724
Or wherever you live.

118
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:55,268
No, not my hotel.

119
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:56,803
Then where?

120
00:10:58,405 --> 00:11:02,637
Look, if you're thinking
of taking a swim, don't.

121
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,679
It's the wrong time of year.
The water is too cold.

122
00:11:07,815 --> 00:11:09,112
I hadn't thought of it.

123
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,516
Oh, well, then, I won't be responsible
for putting ideas in your head.

124
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:14,848
Come.

125
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,855
I know a little place around the corner.

126
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:19,653
You need a drink to warm you up.

127
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,854
Come on.

128
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,658
The bridge will always be here.

129
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:27,691
What do you want to drink?

130
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,029
Anything.

131
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,467
Two Calvados and a package
of Chesterfields.

132
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,765
Only French.

133
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:35,033
Then give me a package
of Laurents... Green.

134
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:36,199
Only Blue.

135
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,847
All right, Blue.

136
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:47,750
I may still have one Green left.

137
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,685
Green. Found one after all.

138
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,059
Were you in the Navy?

139
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,324
No, the circus.

140
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,389
Oh, better still.

141
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:04,491
Here, drink this.

142
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:06,161
Drink it all at once.

143
00:12:06,237 --> 00:12:08,330
For a moment, it will give you the illusion

144
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:11,067
that you are living in a hot, dry country.

145
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,103
Which way are you going?

146
00:12:16,513 --> 00:12:18,310
I don't know.

147
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:19,609
Where do you live?

148
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:21,344
I can't go there, not there.

149
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:24,251
Don't you know anyone
to whom you can go?

150
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:26,118
You could call them up from here.

151
00:12:28,058 --> 00:12:29,319
No.

152
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,585
No, there is nobody.

153
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,388
But you must go somewhere.

154
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,224
Haven't you any money for a room?

155
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,730
Yes, yes, I have.

156
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,266
Then go to a hotel.

157
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,655
Look, you've got to go somewhere.

158
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:41,727
You can't stay
in the streets in this rain.

159
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,736
Yes, you're right.

160
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,070
You're quite right.

161
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,406
Don't trouble about me anymore.

162
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,606
I'll find a place.

163
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:55,171
Thank you for everything.

164
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,525
All right.

165
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,034
Come with me.

166
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:18,230
We'll find something for you.

167
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:19,533
Thank you.

168
00:13:38,891 --> 00:13:41,519
This room was empty yesterday.

169
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:45,859
Madame Favier must have locked it
for fear the bedbugs will get away.

170
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,000
Sit down a moment.

171
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:53,503
I'll try from the balcony side.

172
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:09,514
It's no use.

173
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,486
The window is locked, too.

174
00:14:15,592 --> 00:14:17,856
May I sit here for a moment?

175
00:14:17,928 --> 00:14:19,361
You can sleep here.

176
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,297
That's the easiest thing.

177
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,697
You should have
left me on the street.

178
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,530
You won't disturb me.

179
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,662
It's not the first time
someone has stayed here all night

180
00:14:29,739 --> 00:14:32,333
because he had nowhere else to go.

181
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:34,535
This is a hotel for refugees,

182
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,545
people with prices on their heads,

183
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:40,639
people who hang themselves
the next morning

184
00:14:40,717 --> 00:14:42,708
or leave for Peru.

185
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:44,046
You can take the bed.

186
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:46,212
I'll sleep on the sofa. I'm used to it.

187
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:48,153
No, no, I'Il...

188
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:50,453
I'll just stay where I am.

189
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:56,030
If I may only sit here, that's all.

190
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:58,896
Just as you like.

191
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:00,559
Better take off your coat.

192
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:01,693
It's quite wet.

193
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,464
Your hat, too.

194
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:16,143
Now your shoes.

195
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,080
Take off your stockings.

196
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,091
I'll get you a pair of woolen ones.

197
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:31,161
In critical times,
have an eye for comfort.

198
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,256
That's an old soldier's maxim.

199
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,064
Hello?

200
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,263
Oh, oh, yes, Veber.

201
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,602
I'll be there at once.

202
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:43,504
I've got to go out.

203
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,843
It's all right. You can stay here.

204
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,211
Can't I go with you?

205
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,408
No, no, impossible.

206
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,474
You stay here and take whatever you need.

207
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,746
Oh, here.

208
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,119
You'll find pajamas
in the bottom drawer.

209
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,282
Thank you.

210
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,155
Please, may I keep the light on?

211
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,959
I wasn't going to turn it off.

212
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,829
I know that feeling.

213
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:32,149
Lucien.

214
00:16:32,222 --> 00:16:33,917
Where is my Lucien?

215
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:55,168
How is she?

216
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:57,939
Pulse, 100.

217
00:16:58,012 --> 00:17:00,879
Pressure, 110 over 80.

218
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:21,831
Pulse is weak and thready, 140.

219
00:17:21,902 --> 00:17:24,200
Pressure, 70 over 40.

220
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,833
I can't get her pressure.

221
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,175
Is she gone?

222
00:17:35,249 --> 00:17:36,647
Yes.

223
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:40,509
You did all you could, Ravic.

224
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,383
We can't win against quacks.

225
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,624
Love,

226
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:50,355
your magic spell is everywhere.

227
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,866
The bracelet on her ankle read,
"Always, Lucien."

228
00:17:54,934 --> 00:17:57,527
Where is Lucien now?

229
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,368
21 years old, Veber.

230
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,169
21 years old.

231
00:18:04,242 --> 00:18:06,870
The dignity of man,
the beauty of woman,

232
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:10,142
the innocence and subtlety of love,

233
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,082
a quack in a dirty cellar,

234
00:18:13,151 --> 00:18:14,413
then this.

235
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,918
By now you should be tough.

236
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,180
One is never tough,

237
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:19,586
but one can get used to a lot of things.

238
00:18:19,657 --> 00:18:20,817
That's what I mean.

239
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,860
But with some things, never.

240
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:29,355
Good night, Colonel.

241
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,241
Drive on.

242
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,253
Hello, hello!

243
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,720
Hello, Boris.

244
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:56,280
Eh, busy again
with scientific murder, eh?

245
00:18:56,358 --> 00:19:01,421
Is idiotic, a doctor of your ability
not allowed to work everywhere,

246
00:19:01,496 --> 00:19:03,361
but must hide out as ghost surgeon.

247
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,592
I'm not alone.

248
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,031
The Nazis saw to that.

249
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,433
Colonel.

250
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:10,095
A racing car.

251
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:16,768
You don't laugh?

252
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:19,176
But, Colonel, it was a good joke.

253
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,509
Or wasn't it?

254
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,242
Very good.

255
00:19:22,316 --> 00:19:25,410
But racing car was, perhaps, even better.

256
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,147
Come on.

257
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,456
Mind your manners, Boris.

258
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:35,756
You know, he might
complain to your boss.

259
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:38,127
Oh, Captain Alidze?

260
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:40,291
He was lieutenant in the Tsar's Guard.

261
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:41,925
I was lieutenant-colonel.

262
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,560
He still remembers that, my boy.

263
00:19:43,637 --> 00:19:45,161
You had better remember it, too,

264
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:48,901
you pickpocket of death without passport.

265
00:19:48,975 --> 00:19:50,636
When are you going to be through?

266
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,677
Right after we have drink on the house.

267
00:19:52,745 --> 00:19:54,212
Come along.

268
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:07,824
It's all right.

269
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:08,860
It's me,

270
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,553
the man who brought you here.

271
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:17,493
I think we can turn the light off now.

272
00:20:17,568 --> 00:20:19,593
I thought you would be gone.

273
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,639
I'll go.

274
00:20:21,706 --> 00:20:22,832
Never mind.

275
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:24,101
Wait.

276
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,665
We'll have some breakfast.

277
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,572
Here, drink your coffee.

278
00:20:37,754 --> 00:20:39,187
You got a headache?

279
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,416
No.

280
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,957
Well, I have.

281
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:44,493
But it'll be gone in an hour.

282
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:46,529
Have a brioche.

283
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:47,824
I can't eat.

284
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,365
Well, drink your coffee
and have a cigarette.

285
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:52,298
That's a soldier's breakfast.

286
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,161
I think...

287
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:58,172
What do you think?

288
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,505
I think I should be going.

289
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,771
Back to your hotel?

290
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,042
Perhaps you should.

291
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:08,548
You've got to face it,
whatever it is, sometime.

292
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:10,914
Things may look different
to him in daylight.

293
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:17,621
What's the matter?

294
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,588
Did I say something wrong?

295
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:24,029
He's dead.

296
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:31,368
He died last night.

297
00:21:31,438 --> 00:21:33,963
Then I ran away.

298
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:36,841
That makes it perfect.

299
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,901
Did you kill him?

300
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,411
That makes it less perfect.

301
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:50,422
You'd better tell me the details.

302
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:54,859
He died...

303
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:56,690
suddenly.

304
00:21:56,763 --> 00:21:58,924
Are you sure you didn't kill him?

305
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:05,301
I didn't shoot him or stab him,
if that's what you mean.

306
00:22:05,371 --> 00:22:07,497
All right, he died naturally.
He was sick.

307
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:08,971
Did you have a doctor?

308
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,271
I called one, but he wouldn't
let the doctor touch him.

309
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,936
Why not?

310
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,437
Because of me.

311
00:22:21,486 --> 00:22:24,114
Did you notify the management
of the hotel he was dead?

312
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,246
No.

313
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:27,381
That makes it perfect again.

314
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,653
Why the devil didn't you give me a choice?

315
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,321
If I'd known, I would have
left you on the bridge.

316
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:33,727
I'm sorry. I'll go.

317
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:34,958
Oh, no, you won't go.

318
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,728
The police will want to know
where you spent the night.

319
00:22:37,802 --> 00:22:39,064
I won't tell them.

320
00:22:39,136 --> 00:22:40,398
If you went there alone,

321
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,871
they will be knocking
on my door ten minutes later.

322
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,066
No, no, no, wait.

323
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,732
I'll get dressed and go with you.

324
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,470
You don't have
to help me anymore.

325
00:22:47,544 --> 00:22:49,171
I'm not helping you,
I'm helping myself.

326
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:51,611
This is not my year to see the police.

327
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,778
Was he your husband?

328
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,252
No.

329
00:23:09,898 --> 00:23:11,160
So you're back.

330
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,495
You think you can disappear

331
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:14,263
and leave me to answer
questions to the police?

332
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:17,499
You disgraced my hotel with that...
that thing you left upstairs.

333
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:20,041
You believe, no doubt,
that I've settled this whole mess for you.

334
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,008
Well, I haven't.
You're back to go to prison.

335
00:23:22,077 --> 00:23:24,037
- And if I have anything...
- You come from China?

336
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:25,811
What do you mean?

337
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,939
Nothing. I just wanted to interrupt you.

338
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,449
You would've gone on talking
for another hour.

339
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:38,649
Sit down over there.

340
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:43,956
Do you know the name
of the doctor who was here?

341
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,827
Bonet. Marcel Bonet.

342
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:47,366
Passi 2743.

343
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:50,426
Phone Dr. Bonet to come right over
and sign the death certificate.

344
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:51,596
Get out.

345
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:53,229
Why do you stand around stealing my time?

346
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,534
Get out!

347
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:56,371
And close the door behind you,

348
00:23:56,443 --> 00:23:59,606
unless you want the people
from the street to come in here, too.

349
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:09,943
Well...

350
00:24:11,457 --> 00:24:14,290
There doesn't seem to be
any sign of violence.

351
00:24:24,636 --> 00:24:26,627
Why did you run away last night?

352
00:24:28,306 --> 00:24:31,036
When I came back, he was dead.

353
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:32,076
Back from where?

354
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:34,236
We quarreled.

355
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:35,404
What about?

356
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:38,240
The doctor.

357
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:40,078
Oh. The doctor again.

358
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,846
All right. Now, look.
The police will want to make a list

359
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,387
of what belonged to each of you.

360
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:46,922
Did he have any relatives?

361
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,355
Not in France.

362
00:24:48,425 --> 00:24:50,359
Take everything
that's important to you, and quickly.

363
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,622
There's no time left for sentimentality.

364
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:54,163
Where is his luggage?

365
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,433
It was over there
by the wall last night.

366
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:00,492
Oh, I see. The proprietor.

367
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,767
Mother, you are much
too inquisitive for your age.

368
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:05,500
Get me the proprietor, please.

369
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,676
He said I only sent for the doctor

370
00:25:11,747 --> 00:25:13,681
because I wanted him to get well.

371
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:19,618
I'll see that you get
the first prize for incoherence.

372
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:20,814
I was taking care of him,

373
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:23,517
but he said I only wanted him
to get well so I could leave him.

374
00:25:23,658 --> 00:25:28,789
- Did you?
- Yes.

375
00:25:30,198 --> 00:25:33,099
Well, you have definitely left him now.

376
00:25:34,202 --> 00:25:35,362
No, I haven't.

377
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:38,338
I haven't. Not this way.

378
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:39,702
Why did you want to leave him?

379
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,205
He loved me.

380
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,375
But I didn't love him.

381
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,982
Where are the suitcases?

382
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,150
First, the bill.

383
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,488
First, the suitcases.

384
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:04,655
No one has refused to pay the bill... yet.

385
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,892
And next time, knock before you enter.

386
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,397
Did he keep any money in his suitcases?

387
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,063
Why, I don't know.

388
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,937
Marino always had money in his wallet.

389
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,033
Where is it?

390
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,739
He kept it under his pillow.

391
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,184
American money.

392
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,522
A hundred dollars.

393
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,927
I left the wallet where I found it.
Take it.

394
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,523
You can live on this for a while.

395
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,967
Otherwise, it will rot
at police headquarters.

396
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,705
Thank you.

397
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,798
Come in.

398
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:56,305
Are these all?

399
00:26:56,379 --> 00:26:58,108
Naturally these are all.

400
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,546
Is the bill right?

401
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:02,414
Well, pay it anyway.

402
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:04,476
Uh, 297.

403
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:09,520
- One...
- One...

404
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:12,955
300 francs.

405
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,552
300 francs.

406
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,495
We get three francs change.

407
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:17,793
The concierge?

408
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:19,561
That we'll settle ourselves.

409
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:24,196
Thank you.

410
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:29,110
Now the suitcases.

411
00:27:29,178 --> 00:27:30,907
You may find something you'd want.

412
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,073
Well...

413
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:34,671
the rest is for the police.

414
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:38,742
When one is dead,
one becomes very important.

415
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,618
Would you like to go downstairs
and wait for the police there?

416
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,680
No. I'll stay here.

417
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,316
There is nothing to do here.

418
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:47,258
I know, but...

419
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,558
he won't be here much longer.

420
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:51,427
I often...

421
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:55,995
He wasn't very happy with me.

422
00:27:56,069 --> 00:27:57,661
I was often away.

423
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,431
Now I'll stay.

424
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:02,441
He won't know.

425
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,204
It's not that.

426
00:28:04,277 --> 00:28:06,541
All right. Well, I'll watch the proceedings

427
00:28:06,613 --> 00:28:08,080
from the bistro across the street.

428
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:09,206
Here.

429
00:28:09,282 --> 00:28:11,042
Come to the window
when the police have gone.

430
00:28:11,051 --> 00:28:13,416
I'll come to the window
in my room on the floor above.

431
00:28:55,225 --> 00:28:56,487
Did it go well?

432
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,993
There was no trouble.

433
00:28:58,061 --> 00:28:59,358
What are you going to do now?

434
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:02,365
I don't know.

435
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,497
I suppose you don't want
to stay on in this hotel.

436
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,832
No.

437
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:09,565
You should try the Hotel de Milan.

438
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:10,799
It's clean and decent.

439
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:13,636
Couldn't I go to the hotel where...

440
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:15,733
To your hotel?

441
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,478
The International?

442
00:29:19,482 --> 00:29:20,847
Yes, l...

443
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:22,248
I know it somehow now.

444
00:29:22,318 --> 00:29:24,013
It's better than what I haven't seen.

445
00:29:25,588 --> 00:29:29,546
Well, the International
is not the right hotel for you.

446
00:29:32,594 --> 00:29:34,357
You're right. I'll go to the other.

447
00:29:51,612 --> 00:29:52,874
Is this all right?

448
00:29:52,947 --> 00:29:54,881
Yes. Very good.

449
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:57,042
At least it seems to be clean.

450
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:58,106
Yes.

451
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:11,854
I think you'll be all right here.

452
00:30:11,931 --> 00:30:14,058
Yes, thanks. Many thanks.

453
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:16,067
You should go to bed.

454
00:30:16,135 --> 00:30:18,399
Do you think you'll be able to sleep?

455
00:30:18,471 --> 00:30:19,529
I'll try.

456
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,574
Well, I'll go now.

457
00:30:22,642 --> 00:30:24,473
I'll look you up one of these days.

458
00:30:34,152 --> 00:30:35,915
What's your name?

459
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:36,920
Madou.

460
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,013
Joan Madou.

461
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,250
Joan Madou.

462
00:30:39,324 --> 00:30:40,916
I'll remember it.

463
00:30:40,993 --> 00:30:43,791
Well, perhaps I'd better write it down.

464
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,421
Here.

465
00:30:46,497 --> 00:30:48,431
You write it yourself.

466
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:49,523
It's simpler.

467
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:56,068
Now go to bed.

468
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,869
All you need is a little time,

469
00:30:57,942 --> 00:31:00,274
a certain amount of time
that you have to get through.

470
00:31:00,344 --> 00:31:02,107
You understand.

471
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:03,441
Yes.

472
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:06,277
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

473
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:09,147
I really don't know what
I would have done without you.

474
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:10,618
I really don't know.

475
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,988
Spain, the fascist section,

476
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:50,650
celebrating a German or Italian victory

477
00:31:50,725 --> 00:31:52,158
over their own people.

478
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,301
This was left for Dr. Ravic.

479
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,837
Here.

480
00:32:04,905 --> 00:32:07,100
I'm not expecting a package.
Who brought it?

481
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,471
A woman. A... A lady.

482
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,907
Well, which, woman or lady?

483
00:32:09,977 --> 00:32:11,035
Just... Just in between.

484
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:13,306
- Pretty sharp, eh?
- There's no name on it.

485
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,473
- Did she say it was for me?
- Not just like that.

486
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:17,350
She said it was for
the doctor who lives here.

487
00:32:17,384 --> 00:32:18,214
You know the lady.

488
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:19,886
She was here with you the other morning.

489
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,849
First virtue of hotel employees
is discretion.

490
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,447
Indiscretion is only for gentlemen.

491
00:32:33,099 --> 00:32:35,533
Lieutenant Navarro,
aide-de-camp to Colonel Gómez.

492
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,921
The colonel requests you
to drink a glass of wine with him.

493
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:40,235
We are about to play game of chess.

494
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,739
You did a service for Colonel Gómez
some time ago.

495
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:44,434
This match must not be postponed.

496
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:46,773
Oh, no. It's for the championship.

497
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:55,144
What service did you render
this tin soldier?

498
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,983
I prescribed a laxative for him.

499
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,716
A fascist in the same situation

500
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:02,782
would have prescribed
for a Democrat a poison.

501
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:05,659
What's this? From a Russian?

502
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:08,163
No. Oh, I told you about her.

503
00:33:08,232 --> 00:33:10,166
So she's the one.

504
00:33:10,234 --> 00:33:11,428
Yes.

505
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:13,470
It's a busy day, eh? Come in.

506
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:15,768
I'm Captain Gonzales.

507
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:17,966
We are leaving tonight
to join the glorious army

508
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,338
of Generalissimo Franco.

509
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:22,901
The colonel would like to drink with you
to Spain and Spain's army.

510
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:24,879
Captain, I'm not a...

511
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:25,879
a Spaniard.

512
00:33:25,948 --> 00:33:27,916
We know that.
You are an Austrian.

513
00:33:27,984 --> 00:33:29,076
That makes you German.

514
00:33:29,152 --> 00:33:30,744
Germany and Spain are friends.

515
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:32,880
Please give our regrets

516
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:35,014
to Colonel Gómez,
but the results of our game

517
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:37,787
must be cabled tonight
to New York and Calcutta.

518
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,258
We expected you to decline.

519
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:41,367
We only invited you
because you are with the doctor.

520
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,193
Don't you think we've had
about enough of this?

521
00:33:43,265 --> 00:33:44,459
Yes, Colonel.

522
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,559
I think the simplest thing
is that you go back to your friends.

523
00:33:49,838 --> 00:33:50,998
Thank you.

524
00:33:51,073 --> 00:33:53,837
Thank you for promoting me
to rank of full colonel.

525
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:57,969
Well, I knew, of course, that you were
only a miserable lieutenant-colonel,

526
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,910
but it seems unbearable to me

527
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,505
that you shouldn't have
the same rank as this Gómez.

528
00:34:03,684 --> 00:34:05,618
Have you, uh...

529
00:34:05,686 --> 00:34:07,210
Have you seen her again?

530
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:08,277
No.

531
00:34:08,355 --> 00:34:12,086
Uh. This, of course, is a cry for help.

532
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,294
Hmm. I suppose so.

533
00:34:15,362 --> 00:34:16,885
Go see her, Ravic.

534
00:34:16,963 --> 00:34:17,952
Why?

535
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:21,125
Well, because the colonel says so.

536
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,269
All right, all right.
I'll go and see her tomorrow.

537
00:34:29,542 --> 00:34:30,634
Colonel Gómez.

538
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,836
This will be discussion

539
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:33,776
between two colonels, a short one.

540
00:34:36,548 --> 00:34:38,311
- Gentlemen...
- Make no statement.

541
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:39,975
It will only cause conflict.

542
00:34:40,052 --> 00:34:41,314
Now get out.

543
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:43,320
You should've got out
long ago, you know...

544
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,288
to Spain, to fight.

545
00:34:45,357 --> 00:34:48,815
Germans and Italians
have fought for you there instead.

546
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:51,362
I am unable to challenge you.

547
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:52,692
I am leaving Paris tonight.

548
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,323
The fee for your consultation.

549
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,163
No. One moment.

550
00:34:58,236 --> 00:34:59,464
One moment, please.

551
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:08,936
That is to sober you up! Now get out!

552
00:35:09,013 --> 00:35:10,814
And remember in the future
not to throw money,

553
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:11,747
you medieval idiots!

554
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:12,840
Get out!

555
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:14,406
Get out, get out!

556
00:35:16,753 --> 00:35:17,811
You.

557
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:22,050
If only you were not illegal,

558
00:35:22,125 --> 00:35:24,650
I could've committed
magnificent damage.

559
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:26,389
God bless your eyes.

560
00:35:26,463 --> 00:35:27,691
- And yours.
- Right.

561
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:32,864
The lady's in her room.

562
00:35:32,936 --> 00:35:34,402
Uh, what's the number?

563
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,698
27.

564
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,202
I don't remember her name.

565
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,207
Madou.

566
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:41,868
Oh, yes, yes. Joan Madou.

567
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:43,775
I don't think it's her real name.

568
00:35:43,846 --> 00:35:45,040
Why don't you think so?

569
00:35:45,114 --> 00:35:46,945
She registered as an actress.

570
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:50,474
Oh. I knew an actor
who called himself Gustav Schmidt.

571
00:35:50,553 --> 00:35:54,545
His real name was Alexander Maria,
Count of Zambona.

572
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:56,180
Nowadays, so many things happen.

573
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,657
Mmm, so much does not
actually happen.

574
00:35:58,726 --> 00:36:00,591
Thanks, but for me, it's enough.

575
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,892
For me, too. 27, you said.

576
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,022
Yes, sir.

577
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:07,393
Come in.

578
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,562
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

579
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,196
No. Please come in.

580
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:16,404
Won't you sit down?

581
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,943
Was this here when you moved in?

582
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:22,879
I had it put there.

583
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,577
I hate a bed...

584
00:36:24,651 --> 00:36:26,619
in the daytime.

585
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,615
Were you going out?

586
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,251
Later.

587
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,421
Nowhere in particular.

588
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:41,262
I don't know anyone
except the proprietor, the waiter,

589
00:36:41,334 --> 00:36:43,325
the chambermaid, and you.

590
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,671
It's time you got out of here. Come.

591
00:36:48,674 --> 00:36:50,232
We'll have something to eat.

592
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,978
It's good to sit this way.

593
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,447
You came to me out of pity,
but it means a great deal to me.

594
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,507
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

595
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,612
No. Not yet.

596
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:08,554
Well, the porter told me
that you were an actress

597
00:37:08,627 --> 00:37:10,116
when I asked for your name.

598
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,462
You had forgotten it.

599
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:16,461
Yes. Well, no.

600
00:37:16,533 --> 00:37:19,229
Uh, I'd left the slip of paper in my hotel.

601
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,396
You remember it now?

602
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,463
Yes. Joan. Joan Madou.

603
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,940
I'm not a good actress.
I've only played small parts.

604
00:37:30,046 --> 00:37:31,479
In Italy.

605
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:32,605
Are you Italian?

606
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,980
My mother is Italian.
My father was Romanian.

607
00:37:37,153 --> 00:37:40,020
My mother is still in Italy, I think.

608
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:42,649
Have you done anything else
besides small parts?

609
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:43,885
Some singing.

610
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:46,425
Do you speak any Russian?

611
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:49,931
No, but I sing in Russian.
Gypsy songs.

612
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:51,659
It might be easier.

613
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,633
I know someone who may help you.

614
00:37:53,702 --> 00:37:54,634
Who?

615
00:37:54,703 --> 00:37:56,637
Someone very important.

616
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,832
Colonel Boris Morosov.

617
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:00,966
He's a doorman at the Sheherazade.

618
00:38:02,077 --> 00:38:04,238
Some doormen can do a lot.

619
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:20,957
Come out of that rain
and kiss me, you doter.

620
00:38:28,268 --> 00:38:30,236
Doctor, I'm surprised to see you here.

621
00:38:30,303 --> 00:38:31,565
I forced him, Boris.

622
00:38:31,638 --> 00:38:33,799
This is my first night back in Paris.

623
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,738
Thank the stars I'm with you again.

624
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:38,004
Katya, you have a Russian soul!

625
00:38:38,078 --> 00:38:40,740
Why did you have to be born
in that Boston?

626
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:43,374
Nature went mad that day, Boris.

627
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,518
You have not been around
since you sent me

628
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:49,952
this Joan Madou. Why?

629
00:38:50,022 --> 00:38:51,421
What is the matter with her?

630
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,481
She's alone and hates it.

631
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:55,959
I'm alone, and I intend to stay that way.

632
00:41:51,995 --> 00:41:53,587
What's the matter, Ravic?

633
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:57,822
Do you know that woman?

634
00:41:57,901 --> 00:41:58,889
No.

635
00:42:22,189 --> 00:42:23,121
Good evening.

636
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,122
You're alone.

637
00:42:24,191 --> 00:42:25,283
Yes.

638
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:27,554
Oh, please. Do sit down.

639
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:30,121
I'll do it.

640
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:31,994
Uh, bring another glass, please.

641
00:42:34,702 --> 00:42:37,966
This is vodka.
I don't know if you drink it.

642
00:42:38,038 --> 00:42:39,972
We drank it at the Belle Aurore.

643
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,201
That's right.

644
00:42:51,685 --> 00:42:54,153
I haven't heard that for a long time.

645
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:06,489
Well, shall we go on with this, or...

646
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:10,131
- What was it we drank?
- When?

647
00:43:10,202 --> 00:43:13,137
The first night.
It was the warmest thing I've ever had.

648
00:43:13,205 --> 00:43:14,832
Where did we drink it?

649
00:43:14,907 --> 00:43:16,840
In that little bistro near the Arch.

650
00:43:16,908 --> 00:43:19,035
Where the waiter had a woman
tattooed on his arm.

651
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,840
Oh. Now I know.
It must have been Calvados.

652
00:43:21,913 --> 00:43:23,346
Apple brandy from Normandy.

653
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,440
Uh, waiter, have you Calvados?

654
00:43:26,517 --> 00:43:28,314
Uh... no. Sorry.

655
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,047
No one ever ask for it.

656
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:31,281
You see?

657
00:43:31,356 --> 00:43:33,517
This place is too elegant.

658
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:38,653
Well, the simplest thing would be
to go to that other place again.

659
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:41,460
I'm through for the evening.

660
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:42,828
Fine.

661
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:47,202
Waiter.

662
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,703
Check, please.

663
00:43:48,772 --> 00:43:49,796
Thank you.

664
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,542
- Flowers?
- No, thank you.

665
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,373
Cab, monsieur?

666
00:43:56,445 --> 00:43:58,572
- If you please, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:04,112
Mother? Roses.

668
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:11,426
Tonight I love you.

669
00:44:11,494 --> 00:44:12,688
Thank you, Colonel.

670
00:44:14,596 --> 00:44:15,528
What's the joke?

671
00:44:15,597 --> 00:44:17,224
The joke, my boy,

672
00:44:17,298 --> 00:44:19,425
is that man is great in his intentions

673
00:44:19,501 --> 00:44:21,332
but weak in carrying them out.

674
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,837
Therein lies our misery
and our charm.

675
00:44:23,905 --> 00:44:25,964
God bless your eyes.

676
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,838
- Good night.
- Good night.

677
00:44:27,909 --> 00:44:28,967
Drive on.

678
00:44:30,812 --> 00:44:32,244
That's it.

679
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:34,405
That's where you sat the last time.

680
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:35,743
You still remember?

681
00:44:35,816 --> 00:44:37,909
Perfectly. I never forget anything.

682
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:39,418
Do you remember what we drank?

683
00:44:39,486 --> 00:44:40,418
Calvados.

684
00:44:40,487 --> 00:44:42,512
Right. We'd like to repeat it now.

685
00:44:44,491 --> 00:44:46,482
We'll see if it has the same taste.

686
00:44:48,762 --> 00:44:49,751
Double.

687
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:51,820
You ordered double Calvados then.

688
00:44:53,499 --> 00:44:56,764
You know, you're gradually
giving me an uneasy feeling.

689
00:44:56,836 --> 00:44:58,599
Do you remember
how we were dressed?

690
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,798
Raincoats.
The lady wore a basque beret.

691
00:45:00,873 --> 00:45:02,670
It's a pity you have to be here.

692
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,742
You belong in vaudeville.

693
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,677
I used to be. Circus.

694
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,178
I told you before.

695
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:12,942
This gentleman has a bad memory.

696
00:45:13,952 --> 00:45:17,046
He's an expert at forgetting,
just as you're an expert at not forgetting.

697
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:19,853
Perhaps not, after all.

698
00:45:29,034 --> 00:45:30,295
Does it taste as good?

699
00:45:32,703 --> 00:45:33,692
Better.

700
00:45:37,374 --> 00:45:38,363
Want another?

701
00:45:40,544 --> 00:45:41,875
Would you like to leave?

702
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:49,111
Waiter.

703
00:45:52,222 --> 00:45:53,985
These are what you had the last time.

704
00:45:54,057 --> 00:45:55,046
Are they?

705
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:57,992
Yes, he's right. Laurents, Green.

706
00:45:58,061 --> 00:46:01,997
You see? The lady has
a better memory than you have, sir.

707
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:03,555
That's yet to be proven.

708
00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:08,362
- Thank you.
- Good night.

709
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:09,426
Good night.

710
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,607
I'll take you to your hotel.

711
00:46:18,747 --> 00:46:20,009
Taxi.

712
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:50,439
I'm afraid the gentleman was right...

713
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,943
about memory, I mean.

714
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:55,079
Here.

715
00:46:55,148 --> 00:46:56,137
Thank you.

716
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:05,785
Oh, Dr. Gunther.

717
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:09,559
Alvarez. Jaime Alvarez.

718
00:47:09,628 --> 00:47:10,993
Don't you remember?

719
00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:17,797
Remember now?

720
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,569
On a kitchen table.

721
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:25,575
A temporary field hospital.

722
00:47:25,643 --> 00:47:26,905
At Aranjuez.

723
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:29,003
A little white cottage in an almond grove.

724
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,071
Yes, yes, I remember.

725
00:47:32,116 --> 00:47:34,744
Oh, Alvarez, this is Miss Madou.

726
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,480
How is the leg now?

727
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:41,081
I can bend it completely.

728
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,059
It was good enough
to take me over the Pyrenees.

729
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,022
- It's all right.
- It's all over now.

730
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:49,588
Those of us who can are getting out.

731
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,133
- You're lucky to be here.
- Yes.

732
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,725
- Where are you staying?
- Here.

733
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,738
Beds, Doctor. Real beds.

734
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:59,242
It's a nice hotel.
Just got in this morning.

735
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,874
How are things here?

736
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,505
Oh, fine. The frontiers
are guarded by mere words.

737
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:07,412
The enemy will never break through.

738
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:09,212
- Same all over again.
- Maybe.

739
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:11,717
Would you like a drink?

740
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:14,915
Not now. There are things I have to do.

741
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:17,357
But we'll meet again.

742
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,859
You've hardly said a word
since we left the hotel.

743
00:48:27,936 --> 00:48:29,870
Is it because of that man?

744
00:48:34,442 --> 00:48:35,807
He called you Gunther.

745
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:37,845
- Yes, I know.
- Why did he do that?

746
00:48:37,913 --> 00:48:39,141
Is your name Gunther?

747
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:40,977
My name is Ravic.

748
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,175
But he knew you.

749
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:44,581
Joan, names are unimportant.

750
00:48:44,652 --> 00:48:47,348
Never bother yourself about names.

751
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:50,887
What's the matter?

752
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:54,792
Nothing. I'm happy.
I told you I'm in love.

753
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,459
Have you been happy often?

754
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,060
Have you?

755
00:49:02,135 --> 00:49:03,432
Not often.

756
00:49:03,503 --> 00:49:05,698
When was the last time?

757
00:49:05,772 --> 00:49:07,535
Why do you ask me?

758
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:09,598
Oh, just to ask something.

759
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:12,539
Two years ago.

760
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:16,905
It didn't last long.

761
00:49:16,983 --> 00:49:18,848
Why not?

762
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:20,078
He made terrible scenes.

763
00:49:20,153 --> 00:49:21,915
He didn't understand
I no longer loved him.

764
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:25,613
One never understands that.

765
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:29,127
You would understand.
But then I would always love you.

766
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:32,095
You're different.
Everything with us is different.

767
00:49:32,164 --> 00:49:35,133
He wanted to kill me.

768
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,031
They always talk about it,
but they never do.

769
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:42,533
You wouldn't want to kill me.

770
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:46,068
Your conversation
is becoming more human.

771
00:49:46,143 --> 00:49:47,906
For a moment,
I was pretty frightened.

772
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:49,674
Because I love you?

773
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:52,408
Oh, we won't start that again.

774
00:49:52,483 --> 00:49:55,350
We won't start what again?

775
00:49:55,419 --> 00:49:56,780
Has anyone you loved ever told you

776
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:58,015
that he no longer loved you?

777
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:01,555
Yes.

778
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,114
What did you do?

779
00:50:03,193 --> 00:50:06,219
Everything, but it didn't help.

780
00:50:06,296 --> 00:50:09,129
- I was terribly unhappy.
- For long?

781
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:11,690
A week. About a week.

782
00:50:11,768 --> 00:50:13,759
That's not very long.

783
00:50:13,837 --> 00:50:15,517
It's an eternity if you're really unhappy.

784
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:18,938
I was so filled with unhappiness
that nothing else existed.

785
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:21,738
And, if nothing else exists,

786
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,869
there is nothing left
with which to compare it.

787
00:50:25,681 --> 00:50:28,616
All one can do is to start to live again.

788
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,481
What are you thinking of?

789
00:50:33,555 --> 00:50:35,819
Of how dangerous you are, Joan.

790
00:50:35,891 --> 00:50:38,450
I'm not dangerous.

791
00:50:38,526 --> 00:50:41,256
The fact that you think that is part of it.

792
00:50:47,402 --> 00:50:49,393
- You must be tired.
- No, I'm not tired.

793
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:51,370
- Been walking for miles.
- You didn't answer my question.

794
00:50:51,439 --> 00:50:53,202
What did you do in Spain?

795
00:50:53,274 --> 00:50:55,367
- Cut off legs.
- That's no answer.

796
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:56,932
What kind of an answer do you want?

797
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,808
- A true one.
- I gave you a true one.

798
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,438
Something in you is closed, Ravic,

799
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:03,210
and you won't let anyone or anything in.

800
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:05,183
You're imagining things,
and I need a drink.

801
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:06,947
Let's sit here.

802
00:51:12,759 --> 00:51:13,817
- Good evening.
- Coffee.

803
00:51:13,894 --> 00:51:16,259
- Coffee and brandy.
- Very good, sir.

804
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:17,556
You drink too much.

805
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:18,927
Possibly.

806
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:24,464
Ravic, I'm in love.
I throw myself into it without a thought.

807
00:51:24,537 --> 00:51:26,061
I love you and I'm happy.

808
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:27,127
I'm never cautious.

809
00:51:27,206 --> 00:51:29,470
I'm never afraid of...
of saying what I feel.

810
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:30,907
But you put up a barrier.

811
00:51:30,976 --> 00:51:33,171
There's something in you that resists.

812
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:40,881
What is it?

813
00:51:45,957 --> 00:51:47,948
Ravic!

814
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:09,003
Ravic? Ravic, what is it?
You must tell me.

815
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:10,569
I'm sorry, Joan. I'll get you a cab.

816
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:12,706
I have something to do here.
Please go home.

817
00:52:12,783 --> 00:52:13,772
Taxi!

818
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,112
- Will I see you later tonight?
- No.

819
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:17,846
Perhaps not for a few days.

820
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,411
But why, Ravic?
You must tell me why.

821
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:22,788
I can't talk about it.

822
00:52:24,026 --> 00:52:24,958
All right.

823
00:52:25,027 --> 00:52:27,621
Please, don't be angry with me.

824
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:32,231
How could I ever be angry with you?

825
00:52:39,374 --> 00:52:41,103
Hotel de Milan.

826
00:52:55,723 --> 00:52:58,317
- Hakke?
- Yes. I lost him.

827
00:52:58,392 --> 00:53:01,088
On the corner of Avenue Georges V
and Champs-Elysées.

828
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:06,464
So. So the chances of meeting him
are not everywhere the same.

829
00:53:06,534 --> 00:53:08,263
I intend to look everywhere.

830
00:53:09,537 --> 00:53:12,664
Hey. Ravic, hey.

831
00:53:12,739 --> 00:53:15,799
If you are destined to meet this man,
you will meet him.

832
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,240
Keep your eyes open everywhere.

833
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,710
Be prepared for anything.

834
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,213
But otherwise,
go on living as if you're mistaken,

835
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,613
or you'll drive yourself crazy.

836
00:53:23,683 --> 00:53:25,480
Thank you, Boris.

837
00:53:25,552 --> 00:53:27,417
No, no, no.

838
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:30,513
Don't take the gun.
You'll get only trouble.

839
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:33,524
Don't run any risks.
Don't be hero for nothing.

840
00:53:33,592 --> 00:53:37,221
Hey! You must go, eh?

841
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:38,285
Yes.

842
00:53:40,432 --> 00:53:44,801
Don't shoot unless you are sure
you can escape, eh?

843
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,565
This is your chance.

844
00:53:46,638 --> 00:53:47,969
Don't worry.

845
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:49,667
Oh, Boris, please. Put out the light.

846
00:53:49,741 --> 00:53:50,968
Oh. Yes.

847
00:54:29,445 --> 00:54:31,709
Good morning, Mr. Ravic.

848
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:37,584
Miss Madou didn't go to work tonight.

849
00:54:37,653 --> 00:54:39,245
She's been in all evening.

850
00:54:39,321 --> 00:54:41,881
She's paying extra
for burning her lights all night.

851
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:44,687
Can't sleep in a dark room, she says.

852
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,092
Thank you.

853
00:55:22,462 --> 00:55:24,020
You came back because of me.

854
00:55:24,097 --> 00:55:26,156
Yes, Joan, because of you.
Only because of you.

855
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:30,367
I don't ask anything more.
Only that you love me.

856
00:55:30,436 --> 00:55:33,303
I do. Without love, a man is dead.

857
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,170
- I love you!
- A dead man on a furlough.

858
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:38,710
Don't leave me again.

859
00:55:38,778 --> 00:55:41,372
Love me, love me, love me.

860
00:55:45,251 --> 00:55:48,413
Ravic, we've got to get out of this.

861
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:49,953
We must get away from this hotel,

862
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:51,741
away from the nightclub,
away from the town.

863
00:55:51,756 --> 00:55:54,987
Yes, we'll go away, we'll go away,
where the sun is.

864
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,584
We'll wash the rain away.

865
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:58,253
Wash the past, too.

866
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,161
To Cannes or Antibes.

867
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,096
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

868
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:03,862
Then we'll go.

869
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:05,458
Have we any money?

870
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:08,699
Some. But in two or three weeks,
we'll have enough.

871
00:56:08,772 --> 00:56:11,206
I have to open the stomach
of someone of importance.

872
00:56:11,275 --> 00:56:13,402
He'll provide the rest of the money.

873
00:56:13,477 --> 00:56:16,071
We'll live, Ravic, we'll live!

874
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:19,172
We'll live. Only time dies.

875
00:56:19,249 --> 00:56:21,376
Look, I haven't a thing to wear.

876
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:52,371
I saw you come out of the water.

877
00:56:52,447 --> 00:56:53,505
How could you?

878
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:54,947
Then I covered my eyes.

879
00:56:55,016 --> 00:56:58,349
It was like Venus rising from the sea.

880
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,115
I didn't want to be struck blind.

881
00:57:01,423 --> 00:57:03,253
Now I am blind.

882
00:57:03,324 --> 00:57:05,656
Now I have my sight back.

883
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,990
- How was the water?
- Cold without you.

884
00:57:08,062 --> 00:57:10,394
- But good?
- Yes, yes. Good.

885
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:18,929
How long can we stay?

886
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:21,974
We'll find out tonight at the casino.

887
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:24,236
Have we been winning?

888
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,641
Not enough.

889
00:57:25,712 --> 00:57:28,909
Oh, Ravic, I wish I could
have this life always.

890
00:57:28,982 --> 00:57:31,644
- You find that superficial, don't you?
- No.

891
00:57:31,718 --> 00:57:35,654
It is superficial, but we've had
so little of that in our wretched lives.

892
00:57:35,722 --> 00:57:38,156
In a few days, we'll go
back to Paris, to...

893
00:57:38,224 --> 00:57:40,021
to that nightclub where
nothing ever changes

894
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:43,084
and to life in a dirty hotel.

895
00:57:43,162 --> 00:57:46,131
It was dark before,
and it will be dark again.

896
00:57:50,002 --> 00:57:51,401
Here comes Tinzy and Nugent.

897
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:52,801
Oh, they'll go away again.

898
00:57:52,871 --> 00:57:54,805
We promised to go sailing with them.

899
00:57:54,873 --> 00:57:56,841
Oh. Well, then. Go with them.

900
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:58,376
They're your friends.

901
00:57:58,444 --> 00:57:59,706
Not my friends. They're yours.

902
00:57:59,778 --> 00:58:01,039
You've known them longer.

903
00:58:01,112 --> 00:58:02,943
- Ten minutes longer.
- Well, longer anyway.

904
00:58:03,014 --> 00:58:04,709
- All right.
- Never mind.

905
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:08,115
Go if you want to.
Tell them I have to work.

906
00:58:08,186 --> 00:58:09,676
You told them that yesterday.

907
00:58:09,754 --> 00:58:13,383
Why is that all women love
these idiotic conversations?

908
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,484
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I have no boat.

909
00:58:16,561 --> 00:58:19,427
Life is short.
We're only here for a few days.

910
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,932
Why should I persuade you
to do what you'll do anyway?

911
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,489
All right, you've persuaded me.

912
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:27,196
Good. I'll stay on this rock.

913
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,704
I'm beginning to feel like part of it.

914
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:32,708
You're not a rock.
You're a block of concrete.

915
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,040
Alex!

916
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,531
Monsieur is lucky.

917
00:59:00,602 --> 00:59:03,002
Where's the beautiful lady tonight?

918
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,470
Tonight, the beautiful lady

919
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:06,905
is behaving like a beautiful lady.

920
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,637
Do you feel lucky?

921
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:11,644
Do you?

922
00:59:11,713 --> 00:59:12,805
Not a chance.

923
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:19,482
The beautiful lady is here.

924
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:33,431
23.

925
00:59:41,507 --> 00:59:42,599
5.

926
00:59:42,675 --> 00:59:43,767
8.

927
01:00:00,258 --> 01:00:02,089
Will you please put that
on number 6 for me?

928
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,525
- All right.
- Thank you.

929
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:06,019
5.

930
01:00:13,538 --> 01:00:15,471
Ah, you are idiots.

931
01:00:15,539 --> 01:00:17,097
Choose your side, Joan.

932
01:00:36,726 --> 01:00:38,751
- Were you going to drive off without me?
- No.

933
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:40,728
You were going to leave me behind
with those idiots.

934
01:00:40,797 --> 01:00:41,764
Where are you going?

935
01:00:41,831 --> 01:00:43,264
Nowhere. Just for a drive.

936
01:00:43,333 --> 01:00:45,460
- I'll go with you.
- What about your idiots?

937
01:00:45,535 --> 01:00:48,095
- I told them you were waiting for me.
- Good. Get in.

938
01:00:49,339 --> 01:00:50,897
Better put this around you.

939
01:01:04,252 --> 01:01:05,276
Must be the air.

940
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,855
Oh, don't be angry with me, Ravic.

941
01:01:11,927 --> 01:01:14,258
This is the first time
I've been on the Riviera.

942
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:17,855
First time. The first time.

943
01:01:17,932 --> 01:01:20,662
Oh, forget what happened today.
Don't think about it.

944
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:22,930
You're a wonderful driver, Ravic.
You know that?

945
01:01:23,004 --> 01:01:25,404
Those idiots were saying the same thing.

946
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,963
You're uncanny. You have no past.

947
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:28,133
Nobody knows anything about you.

948
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:29,437
I know a hundred times more

949
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:32,535
about the life of those idiots
than I know about yours.

950
01:01:39,786 --> 01:01:40,775
Too fast?

951
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:42,378
No. Drive fast.

952
01:01:42,455 --> 01:01:44,389
I love you, Ravic.

953
01:01:44,457 --> 01:01:46,550
Let's never go back to Paris.

954
01:01:46,626 --> 01:01:49,652
Let's steal a trunk
full of jewels or rob a bank,

955
01:01:49,729 --> 01:01:52,219
take this car, and never come back.

956
01:01:52,297 --> 01:01:53,730
Careful.

957
01:01:53,799 --> 01:01:56,063
If you want that Calvados,
you'd better let me drive.

958
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:58,861
That's fine.

959
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:06,505
Come. We'll get your Calvados here.

960
01:02:08,814 --> 01:02:10,303
Two Calvados.

961
01:02:13,484 --> 01:02:15,042
How much have you had already?

962
01:02:19,991 --> 01:02:21,891
How much have you had to drink?

963
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:25,095
Too much.

964
01:02:25,163 --> 01:02:27,723
Too much because of you,
because I was away from you.

965
01:02:27,799 --> 01:02:30,266
- Then why didn't you come to me?
- I did come to you.

966
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:31,994
Yes, when you saw me leave.

967
01:02:34,071 --> 01:02:35,163
Did you win?

968
01:02:36,673 --> 01:02:37,935
Yes.

969
01:02:38,008 --> 01:02:39,942
Then let's go to the most
expensive restaurant

970
01:02:40,010 --> 01:02:41,409
and have caviar and champagne.

971
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:45,477
Let's be like our parents were
before all these wars...

972
01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:47,540
carefree and sentimental and without fear.

973
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:50,414
Full of bad taste and tears,

974
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:53,080
and the moon, oleanders, violins,

975
01:02:53,155 --> 01:02:55,715
and the ocean and love.

976
01:02:55,791 --> 01:02:57,471
I want to believe that I'm married to you,

977
01:02:57,493 --> 01:03:00,462
that we have children
and a garden and a house.

978
01:03:00,529 --> 01:03:02,793
I've given up a great career for your sake.

979
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:06,126
And we still love each other...

980
01:03:06,202 --> 01:03:08,032
after 20 years.

981
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:11,196
And you still think me beautiful.

982
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:13,465
And I can't sleep

983
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:15,839
when you're not at home for one night.

984
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:19,775
That's all part of it...

985
01:03:19,848 --> 01:03:22,112
part of that bad taste.

986
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:28,718
There is no use in our planning, Joan.

987
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,323
I know.

988
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:34,986
No. No, you don't know.

989
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,086
It's not what you think.

990
01:03:36,163 --> 01:03:38,495
It's something I should
have told you before.

991
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:39,657
I can't marry you.

992
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,257
I'm a refugee without a passport,

993
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:42,825
and I can't get one.

994
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,167
I have no proof of my identity.

995
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,138
I live illegally here.

996
01:03:47,206 --> 01:03:49,174
On paper, I don't exist.

997
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,211
If they should catch me,
l... I'd be deported.

998
01:03:52,278 --> 01:03:55,111
Deported? Deported from France?

999
01:03:55,181 --> 01:03:57,308
No, but, Ravic, Ravic, Ra...

1000
01:03:57,383 --> 01:03:59,374
I'd be back. I know the borders.

1001
01:03:59,452 --> 01:04:00,544
It wouldn't be the first time.

1002
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:01,552
Nor the last.

1003
01:04:01,621 --> 01:04:03,020
Oh, it isn't that bad.

1004
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,182
They haven't caught me in over a year.

1005
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,021
Oh, there is nothing
for us, Ravic, nothing.

1006
01:04:15,433 --> 01:04:17,993
Tears solve nothing.

1007
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:21,163
Look. Our Calvados is here. Come.

1008
01:04:22,941 --> 01:04:25,670
What if I could close my eyes

1009
01:04:25,743 --> 01:04:27,404
and... open them

1010
01:04:27,478 --> 01:04:30,538
and find all danger gone...

1011
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:33,378
at last alone in the past?

1012
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,384
All I can give you

1013
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:38,012
is my love in this bitter present.

1014
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:55,801
To the present.

1015
01:05:10,452 --> 01:05:12,613
It's a comfort to have you
back in Paris, Ravic.

1016
01:05:12,688 --> 01:05:16,920
It's good to be back and alive
and happy and working.

1017
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:18,084
And well fed.

1018
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,252
Well, so long.

1019
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:20,818
I'll come by this evening.

1020
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:49,918
I looked up and saw the cable snap.

1021
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:52,288
He was riding a steel beam
and never had a chance.

1022
01:05:52,359 --> 01:05:55,226
Oh, no, no. Don't lift him.
Leave him where he is.

1023
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:56,421
What are you, a doctor?

1024
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:57,861
- Yes.
- All right.

1025
01:06:03,035 --> 01:06:04,195
Unconscious, isn't he?

1026
01:06:05,371 --> 01:06:06,963
Dead.

1027
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:09,371
But we've just been eating lunch together.

1028
01:06:09,441 --> 01:06:10,567
Somebody call an ambulance.

1029
01:06:10,643 --> 01:06:11,837
The cable hit the woman.
She's bleeding.

1030
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:12,843
- You.
- Where is she?

1031
01:06:12,912 --> 01:06:13,970
Over here, sir.

1032
01:06:20,885 --> 01:06:22,216
Bring her over here.

1033
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:26,047
Careful.

1034
01:06:38,102 --> 01:06:41,002
Now, don't worry.
You'll be all right.

1035
01:06:41,071 --> 01:06:43,471
Has anyone called for an ambulance?

1036
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:45,371
Here come the police.
They'll get one.

1037
01:06:45,442 --> 01:06:46,636
Well, I've got to go.

1038
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:47,904
Back, please.

1039
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:50,911
The woman is half dead,
and you want to leave?

1040
01:06:50,981 --> 01:06:52,175
Who put this bandage on?

1041
01:06:52,249 --> 01:06:53,739
He did. He says he's a doctor.

1042
01:06:53,817 --> 01:06:55,182
I've tied up the artery.

1043
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:57,015
Better get her to a hospital fast.

1044
01:06:57,087 --> 01:06:59,077
Phone for the ambulance.

1045
01:07:07,263 --> 01:07:08,594
One moment, Doctor.

1046
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:11,691
May I have your name?

1047
01:07:11,767 --> 01:07:12,699
Police.

1048
01:07:12,768 --> 01:07:14,201
Woyczek.

1049
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:15,202
You're a German.

1050
01:07:15,271 --> 01:07:16,203
No, a Czech.

1051
01:07:16,272 --> 01:07:17,500
I don't think you're a Czech.

1052
01:07:17,573 --> 01:07:19,414
- Listen, General...
- I think you're a German.

1053
01:07:19,441 --> 01:07:21,807
Have you a license to practice here?

1054
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:24,709
I don't practice here.
I'm a tourist. A Czech tourist.

1055
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,213
- May I?
- Certainly.

1056
01:07:27,282 --> 01:07:28,271
Hold it.

1057
01:07:29,451 --> 01:07:31,419
- Have you a passport with you?
- Is that necessary?

1058
01:07:31,486 --> 01:07:33,351
- The gentleman's helped a woman.
- I'm interested.

1059
01:07:33,421 --> 01:07:35,421
Have you a passport with you
or your identity card?

1060
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:37,354
- No, not with me.
- Where is it?

1061
01:07:37,424 --> 01:07:39,619
At the consulate.
It has to be extended.

1062
01:07:39,693 --> 01:07:40,887
Which consulate?

1063
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:42,724
The Czech Consulate.

1064
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:46,505
- All right, I'll call them up and ask.
- Of course.

1065
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:50,594
You won't mind staying here
until this is cleared up, Dr. Woyczek?

1066
01:07:51,972 --> 01:07:53,462
You see that he does.

1067
01:07:56,642 --> 01:07:58,576
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Never mind.

1068
01:07:58,644 --> 01:07:59,736
You must understand, sir.

1069
01:07:59,812 --> 01:08:02,679
Fernand's father was hanged
by the Germans in the last war.

1070
01:08:02,749 --> 01:08:04,649
That's why he's crazy on the subject.

1071
01:08:04,717 --> 01:08:06,912
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
If it was up to me...

1072
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:08,578
I understand.

1073
01:08:08,654 --> 01:08:12,317
Uh, may I use that telephone
before your friend returns?

1074
01:08:13,826 --> 01:08:15,589
Why, certainly.

1075
01:08:23,602 --> 01:08:24,591
Yeah.

1076
01:08:31,676 --> 01:08:33,109
All right.

1077
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:34,372
All right, Monsieur Woyczek.

1078
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:43,343
Of course I will remember.

1079
01:08:44,688 --> 01:08:46,315
So long, Woyczek.

1080
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,624
The world should be
executed for murder.

1081
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:02,860
Ravic.

1082
01:09:08,178 --> 01:09:09,167
Ravic?

1083
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:13,473
Arrested. They have arrested him.

1084
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:14,914
When? Where? No!

1085
01:09:14,983 --> 01:09:15,972
Joan.

1086
01:09:20,889 --> 01:09:21,981
Where did they take him?

1087
01:09:22,057 --> 01:09:23,752
We can bribe them.
We can get the money.

1088
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,192
- You must not go to him, Joan.
- I must! I must! They will deport him.

1089
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,161
He said no one must go to him.

1090
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:31,563
All the police have now is a man
they have found in the street...

1091
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:34,328
a face with no papers, no identity.

1092
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:36,165
But I'll find some way of getting him out.

1093
01:09:36,237 --> 01:09:38,467
They have to believe
whatever that face tells them.

1094
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:41,406
And since there is no proof
that he has been in France before,

1095
01:09:41,476 --> 01:09:44,206
that means deportation
after two weeks in jail.

1096
01:09:44,278 --> 01:09:46,269
But I must... I must see him.
I must go to him.

1097
01:09:46,347 --> 01:09:48,008
There must be some way, somebody.
Where did they take him?

1098
01:09:48,082 --> 01:09:51,017
Joan, if you go to Ravic now,
you will open a door into his past.

1099
01:09:51,085 --> 01:09:52,881
I knew they would catch him! I knew it!

1100
01:09:52,953 --> 01:09:56,184
The minute the authorities find out
that he has been deported before...

1101
01:09:56,256 --> 01:09:59,225
not once, but many times...

1102
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:02,523
that means six months
in jail before deportation.

1103
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:04,621
And then they'll catch him again
when he goes back,

1104
01:10:04,698 --> 01:10:06,893
and I won't be able to live for fear of...

1105
01:10:10,604 --> 01:10:14,869
I wish I could say something
comforting, cheerful, pleasant.

1106
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:18,569
But history has no special
accommodations for lovers.

1107
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:24,181
I'll do as he asks.
I won't go near him.

1108
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,481
I'll stay here for the two weeks,
and then I'll go wherever he goes.

1109
01:10:27,553 --> 01:10:32,046
It is possible to share
all of the happiness of someone else,

1110
01:10:32,123 --> 01:10:35,559
but only so much of the despair.

1111
01:10:35,627 --> 01:10:38,721
Pity is a pleasure
for comfortable people only.

1112
01:10:38,796 --> 01:10:42,163
It will not last long
in cold border towns,

1113
01:10:42,233 --> 01:10:45,725
filthy cellars, without money,
not enough food.

1114
01:10:45,803 --> 01:10:48,067
Not one place where you can sleep safe.

1115
01:10:48,139 --> 01:10:52,700
And each day the struggle
for mere survival becomes worse.

1116
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:54,767
- Each day...
- Spare me the rest.

1117
01:10:56,313 --> 01:10:59,749
Tell me he'll be pushed
from prison to prison,

1118
01:10:59,816 --> 01:11:02,614
shoveled back and forth
over the borders like dirt.

1119
01:11:02,686 --> 01:11:05,814
Tell me he'll be shot one day,
running like an animal,

1120
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:07,857
always running and no place to go to.

1121
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:09,186
Damn it!

1122
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:12,022
Go on, tell me that we're talking
about a dead man!

1123
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:20,164
A refugee without passport

1124
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:23,433
has lost his membership
in the human race.

1125
01:11:23,506 --> 01:11:26,805
Those who remain alive must go on living.

1126
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:35,272
I can't live like this.

1127
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:39,252
I can't go back to one room
and four walls, alone.

1128
01:11:40,522 --> 01:11:43,286
And the darkness of night, and nothing...

1129
01:11:43,358 --> 01:11:44,950
I can't go back to that.

1130
01:11:45,026 --> 01:11:48,119
Alone, without hope.

1131
01:11:48,195 --> 01:11:49,457
Hope.

1132
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:53,057
Hope is luxury we cannot afford this year.

1133
01:11:54,702 --> 01:11:56,966
Why didn't he call me?

1134
01:11:57,037 --> 01:11:58,299
He should have called me.

1135
01:11:58,372 --> 01:11:59,896
He had only a minute.

1136
01:11:59,974 --> 01:12:01,236
And he called you?

1137
01:12:01,308 --> 01:12:05,711
Minute is too short to say good-bye
to somebody you love.

1138
01:12:08,715 --> 01:12:11,149
What did he say, for me?

1139
01:12:11,217 --> 01:12:12,809
Good-bye.

1140
01:12:12,885 --> 01:12:16,116
He said good-bye.

1141
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:18,885
Didn't he ask me to wait?

1142
01:12:18,958 --> 01:12:21,392
He said good-bye.

1143
01:12:35,907 --> 01:12:37,898
What are those?

1144
01:12:42,648 --> 01:12:45,514
You and Ravic in Antibes.

1145
01:12:48,419 --> 01:12:50,410
Destroy them.

1146
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:37,195
Good morning, Miss Madou.

1147
01:13:37,266 --> 01:13:38,927
Morning, Albert.

1148
01:13:47,475 --> 01:13:50,137
Take some hot coffee.
You're soaked.

1149
01:13:56,918 --> 01:13:58,715
It's much too early for the mail.

1150
01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:00,481
Yes, I know.

1151
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:02,488
I promised I'd let you know at once

1152
01:14:02,556 --> 01:14:04,581
if a letter comes.

1153
01:14:04,658 --> 01:14:06,683
But it never comes, does it?

1154
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:09,228
You've been doing this for months.

1155
01:14:09,296 --> 01:14:12,595
You ought to go back to work
instead of walking the city all night.

1156
01:14:12,666 --> 01:14:14,463
It's not right.

1157
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,764
Unwise, Albert.

1158
01:14:16,837 --> 01:14:18,771
Very unwise.

1159
01:14:18,839 --> 01:14:20,773
I don't just walk the city,

1160
01:14:20,841 --> 01:14:22,102
not always.

1161
01:14:22,174 --> 01:14:24,142
Sometimes you go to the railroad stations.

1162
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,370
Is that it?

1163
01:14:25,444 --> 01:14:28,470
Yes, the stations.

1164
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,107
Don't men molest you?

1165
01:14:31,183 --> 01:14:33,845
They don't like women who aren't gay.

1166
01:14:33,919 --> 01:14:35,443
Miss Madou,

1167
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:38,615
why don't you put out your light
when you leave your room?

1168
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:39,953
It burns all night.

1169
01:14:40,025 --> 01:14:43,824
The bill runs up frightfully,
and your money won't last forever.

1170
01:14:43,895 --> 01:14:46,455
You're right, Albert.

1171
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:47,896
Thank you for the coffee.

1172
01:14:47,966 --> 01:14:49,957
Oh, Miss Madou?

1173
01:14:50,034 --> 01:14:52,127
A man came to see you.

1174
01:14:52,203 --> 01:14:53,693
A man?

1175
01:14:53,772 --> 01:14:55,137
What man? Who?

1176
01:14:55,206 --> 01:14:57,470
I don't know.
I never saw him before.

1177
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,169
What... What did he say?
What did he want?

1178
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:02,144
He said he had to see you.

1179
01:15:02,212 --> 01:15:03,474
Where did he go?

1180
01:15:03,547 --> 01:15:06,038
He also said he was a
friend of Mr. Ravic's,

1181
01:15:06,116 --> 01:15:08,949
so I had him wait in your room.

1182
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:21,421
I would have found you sooner, Joan,

1183
01:15:21,497 --> 01:15:23,192
if I had known where to look.

1184
01:15:24,734 --> 01:15:26,361
I'm going back to Antibes.

1185
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,834
Will you come?

1186
01:16:05,272 --> 01:16:07,035
Ah, Monsieur Ravic.

1187
01:16:07,107 --> 01:16:09,132
I haven't seen you in some time.

1188
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:11,508
Woyczek.

1189
01:16:13,514 --> 01:16:15,141
When did you get back?

1190
01:16:15,216 --> 01:16:16,546
This afternoon.

1191
01:16:16,616 --> 01:16:18,880
You stayed away more than three months.

1192
01:16:18,952 --> 01:16:20,214
It's getting harder.

1193
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:22,186
They watch the borders more closely.

1194
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:23,688
I was caught five times.

1195
01:16:23,756 --> 01:16:25,883
Why did I not hear from you?

1196
01:16:25,959 --> 01:16:27,551
Letters never help.

1197
01:16:27,627 --> 01:16:29,720
Sit down, sit down.

1198
01:16:29,796 --> 01:16:31,593
- Have dinner.
- No, thank you.

1199
01:16:31,664 --> 01:16:34,394
Drink then. Hey.

1200
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:36,400
Ah, Monsieur Ravic,
you haven't been here for long time.

1201
01:16:36,468 --> 01:16:37,457
How are you?

1202
01:16:37,536 --> 01:16:38,628
What will it be, Colonel?

1203
01:16:38,704 --> 01:16:39,500
Another bottle, another glass.

1204
01:16:39,571 --> 01:16:40,663
At your service, Colonel.

1205
01:16:40,739 --> 01:16:43,765
Monsieur Ravic.

1206
01:16:43,842 --> 01:16:45,332
I thought your name was Woyczek.

1207
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:47,970
It was. Sometimes Neumann.

1208
01:16:48,046 --> 01:16:49,513
Occasionally Gunter.

1209
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:51,378
But I don't want to give up Ravic.

1210
01:16:51,450 --> 01:16:52,849
I like it as a name.

1211
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:54,283
You are back at the International, eh?

1212
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:57,150
Yes, yes. Back in my old room.

1213
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:00,554
Never seen this place so busy.

1214
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,855
Oh! People have gone crazy.

1215
01:17:02,927 --> 01:17:05,725
We could stay open 24 hours a day.

1216
01:17:05,796 --> 01:17:08,560
And mostly German tourists.

1217
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:09,930
They speak French very well.

1218
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:13,402
Not at all the way the Germans
spoke it several years ago.

1219
01:17:13,471 --> 01:17:14,937
Spend a lot of money, don't they?

1220
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:17,599
They treat everybody
who will drink with them.

1221
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:21,110
Strange, all those German tourists.

1222
01:17:21,177 --> 01:17:24,010
With plenty of money,
and speaking good French.

1223
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:58,011
Nice voice.

1224
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,606
Ravic, you are talking to your father.

1225
01:18:01,683 --> 01:18:03,776
Connoisseur of the human heart.

1226
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:05,751
Do not make detours.
Ask me quickly.

1227
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,720
Let's get this behind us.

1228
01:18:07,789 --> 01:18:10,189
- All right, where is she?
- She is not here.

1229
01:18:10,258 --> 01:18:12,657
I have not heard anything
about her for several weeks.

1230
01:18:12,726 --> 01:18:14,193
And before that?

1231
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:16,354
Before that, she inquired for you,

1232
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:20,491
for some time, and then not anymore.

1233
01:18:20,567 --> 01:18:22,330
When did she leave her job here?

1234
01:18:22,402 --> 01:18:26,304
Not for some weeks after you left.

1235
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:29,206
Do you know what she's doing now?

1236
01:18:29,276 --> 01:18:31,675
The last I heard of her,
she was in the south.

1237
01:18:32,845 --> 01:18:36,372
- Heard from whom?
- From the check room girl.

1238
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:39,179
You want to see her, eh?

1239
01:18:39,251 --> 01:18:41,276
- Yes.
- So.

1240
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:45,188
If ever I open the door for her,
I will let you know.

1241
01:19:04,142 --> 01:19:06,235
- Well, is she still here?
- Yes.

1242
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:10,110
Alone? My boy, a reigning queen
could not get in here alone.

1243
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,114
Take care of this for me, will you?

1244
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,571
What is it, darling?

1245
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,366
Nothing.

1246
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:43,935
Let me go. I'll be right back.

1247
01:19:56,658 --> 01:19:57,682
Ravic...

1248
01:19:57,759 --> 01:19:59,249
Hello, Joan.

1249
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,963
You're back.

1250
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:04,464
How long have you been back?

1251
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:07,797
Two weeks.

1252
01:20:07,868 --> 01:20:09,301
Two weeks, and you didn't even...

1253
01:20:12,273 --> 01:20:14,503
No one knew where to find you.

1254
01:20:14,575 --> 01:20:16,338
Why did you never write?

1255
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:17,377
I couldn't.

1256
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:18,412
That's a lie.

1257
01:20:18,479 --> 01:20:21,471
I didn't know whether I could...

1258
01:20:21,549 --> 01:20:23,141
Come with me.

1259
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,188
I didn't know whether
I could come back again.

1260
01:20:29,255 --> 01:20:30,688
You're lying. That's no reason.

1261
01:20:30,757 --> 01:20:31,838
You've been back two weeks,

1262
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,415
and you haven't done
the least thing to find me.

1263
01:20:33,493 --> 01:20:36,792
Joan, you didn't get that tan in Paris.

1264
01:20:36,863 --> 01:20:38,626
Well, I just came back from Antibes.

1265
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,762
So I see.

1266
01:20:43,103 --> 01:20:45,037
Ravic, what are you doing here?

1267
01:20:45,105 --> 01:20:46,162
You must go...

1268
01:20:48,974 --> 01:20:50,703
You must go away.
They'll arrest you again.

1269
01:20:50,776 --> 01:20:53,540
I know all about that now.
Next time, it'll be six months in prison.

1270
01:20:53,612 --> 01:20:55,045
That was bad luck.

1271
01:20:55,114 --> 01:20:59,073
As a matter of fact, I hadn't thought
of looking for you in Antibes.

1272
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:03,648
Whatever you're thinking isn't true.

1273
01:21:03,722 --> 01:21:06,383
Not true at all.

1274
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:08,357
Go back to your table, Joan.

1275
01:21:08,426 --> 01:21:11,327
Your friends must be getting restless.

1276
01:21:13,131 --> 01:21:14,428
It's your fault.

1277
01:21:14,499 --> 01:21:16,262
Yours. Yours alone.

1278
01:21:39,055 --> 01:21:40,886
All right. Turn on the light.

1279
01:21:43,527 --> 01:21:46,051
Oh, Joan, please.
We're not playing hide-and-seek.

1280
01:21:46,128 --> 01:21:48,096
Did you know I would come?

1281
01:21:48,164 --> 01:21:49,631
- No.
- Your door was open.

1282
01:21:50,733 --> 01:21:51,825
My door is often open.

1283
01:21:51,901 --> 01:21:54,028
I thought you wouldn't be here yet.

1284
01:21:54,103 --> 01:21:56,128
I thought you would be
out drinking somewhere.

1285
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:00,040
I was playing chess instead.

1286
01:22:00,109 --> 01:22:01,235
What?

1287
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:02,799
Chess.

1288
01:22:02,877 --> 01:22:04,344
With Morosov, downstairs.

1289
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:07,210
Chess? But... You can play chess wh...

1290
01:22:07,282 --> 01:22:11,150
It worked. As a matter of fact,
I won a game.

1291
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,739
You are the coldest, most unfeeling...

1292
01:22:12,754 --> 01:22:16,986
See? We've even built up
and etiquette for unhappiness.

1293
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,582
If you'd found me blind drunk,

1294
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,958
everything would have been in good taste.

1295
01:22:21,029 --> 01:22:23,588
The fact that I played chess
and went to sleep

1296
01:22:23,664 --> 01:22:26,064
is proof that I am crude and unfeeling.

1297
01:22:27,835 --> 01:22:30,235
That's good.
I couldn't stand that thing anyway.

1298
01:22:30,304 --> 01:22:33,273
But don't get splinters in your feet.

1299
01:22:38,312 --> 01:22:40,246
Ravic, I'm sorry, but...

1300
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:42,213
when I saw you tonight,
suddenly I couldn't think at all.

1301
01:22:42,281 --> 01:22:43,839
And when you left,
I thought you'd left for good.

1302
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:44,746
I couldn't have endured it!

1303
01:22:44,817 --> 01:22:46,857
You can't leave me alone.
You're responsible for me.

1304
01:22:48,221 --> 01:22:50,155
Are you alone?

1305
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:53,925
You're responsible for me.

1306
01:22:53,993 --> 01:22:55,358
All right. All right.

1307
01:22:55,428 --> 01:22:58,989
I'm responsible for the occupation
of Czechoslovakia, too.

1308
01:22:59,065 --> 01:23:02,329
Now, stop it. It's getting light,
it's time for you to go.

1309
01:23:04,302 --> 01:23:06,327
You don't love me anymore.

1310
01:23:06,404 --> 01:23:09,532
Oh, what idiots have you been with
the last three months?

1311
01:23:09,608 --> 01:23:11,075
What else could I have done?

1312
01:23:11,142 --> 01:23:12,973
Sit at the door to your hotel
and stare at the walls...

1313
01:23:13,044 --> 01:23:15,512
No, no, no, no.
No confessions, please.

1314
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,810
I don't want any confessions.

1315
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:21,640
What I want to know is why you're here.

1316
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:27,447
I'm here. Isn't that enough?

1317
01:23:30,294 --> 01:23:32,159
Yes. Yes, you're right.

1318
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:33,287
It's enough.

1319
01:23:36,867 --> 01:23:39,391
You say that, but first you have
to take away all the joy.

1320
01:23:44,207 --> 01:23:46,539
What are you going to do?
Throw me out?

1321
01:24:02,691 --> 01:24:04,818
We should have done this
long before now.

1322
01:24:04,893 --> 01:24:06,827
Yes.

1323
01:24:09,464 --> 01:24:11,523
Why don't you ask me, Ravic?

1324
01:24:14,169 --> 01:24:16,694
About what happened in between.

1325
01:24:21,309 --> 01:24:24,176
Don't you want to know
where I live, how I live?

1326
01:24:24,245 --> 01:24:26,736
Joan, look outside.

1327
01:24:26,814 --> 01:24:29,544
Ask the air whether it rained yesterday.

1328
01:24:29,617 --> 01:24:33,018
Whether there was a war
in China or Spain.

1329
01:24:33,087 --> 01:24:37,022
Whether thousands are dying
or being born at this moment.

1330
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:39,684
The world exists. We exist.

1331
01:24:39,759 --> 01:24:42,421
Why rake up dead leaves?

1332
01:24:49,469 --> 01:24:51,369
Did you miss me?

1333
01:24:51,438 --> 01:24:55,374
- Yes.
- Much?

1334
01:24:55,442 --> 01:24:57,341
Yes.

1335
01:24:57,409 --> 01:25:00,401
I haven't heard that for a long time.

1336
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:02,777
I'll drop you off at the hospital.

1337
01:25:12,224 --> 01:25:14,488
Flowers?

1338
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:18,023
- Why are they closed?
- They're having a party.

1339
01:25:18,096 --> 01:25:19,723
It's the captain's birthday.

1340
01:25:19,797 --> 01:25:21,094
No customers allowed.

1341
01:25:21,165 --> 01:25:22,723
Thank you.

1342
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:07,767
Not so fast, my friends.

1343
01:26:07,843 --> 01:26:10,641
Give me a slower song, more romantic.

1344
01:26:10,713 --> 01:26:12,271
I've a long journey ahead.

1345
01:26:35,202 --> 01:26:38,103
Have you heard from her?

1346
01:26:38,172 --> 01:26:40,504
No. Not for three days.

1347
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:47,308
Hey! Sad songs are for customers!

1348
01:26:47,381 --> 01:26:50,475
Let us have some gaiety, eh?

1349
01:27:02,462 --> 01:27:05,795
I think we have had enough
of this party, don't you?

1350
01:27:05,865 --> 01:27:07,162
Want to take walk?

1351
01:27:07,233 --> 01:27:09,827
No. Don't be so sentimental.

1352
01:27:09,902 --> 01:27:12,028
Might as well get used to it.

1353
01:27:28,353 --> 01:27:30,411
Ravic, come in.

1354
01:27:31,989 --> 01:27:33,923
It's good to have you here.

1355
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:39,455
I've been waiting for you.

1356
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,624
You didn't call me for days,
so I had to call you.

1357
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,600
Come.

1358
01:27:44,668 --> 01:27:47,000
How do you like it?

1359
01:27:47,071 --> 01:27:49,595
It's nice.

1360
01:27:49,672 --> 01:27:51,867
Large and nice.

1361
01:27:53,009 --> 01:27:54,237
Do you know how it works?

1362
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,800
- No.
- Oh, it's wonderful.

1363
01:27:55,879 --> 01:27:57,608
It plays for hours,
and I can lie here and listen

1364
01:27:57,680 --> 01:27:59,545
and watch it getting
dark outside and dream.

1365
01:27:59,616 --> 01:28:00,674
Do you like it?

1366
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:02,775
Come, you haven't seen the rest yet.

1367
01:28:02,852 --> 01:28:05,013
One feels quite different
in an apartment.

1368
01:28:05,088 --> 01:28:08,386
Different than in those
dreary hotel rooms.

1369
01:28:08,457 --> 01:28:11,392
Yes, you're right.

1370
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:16,329
Well, that's nice to have
had a look at all this.

1371
01:28:19,668 --> 01:28:21,761
Ravic, you're not going?

1372
01:28:23,172 --> 01:28:25,834
Yes, Joan. For good.

1373
01:28:28,142 --> 01:28:29,439
What are you saying? Why?

1374
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:33,139
This whole place should tell you why.

1375
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:37,340
Who's been talking to you,
telling you things? Morozov?

1376
01:28:37,418 --> 01:28:39,147
No one had to tell me anything.

1377
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:42,417
I know, because I have this apartment,

1378
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,185
because I don't work
at the Sheherazade any longer,

1379
01:28:44,258 --> 01:28:46,488
Morosov starts imagining things,
and you fall right in with him.

1380
01:28:46,561 --> 01:28:47,857
- Stop it.
- That a person can be somebody,

1381
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:49,888
and make something out
of herself, that's a bit...

1382
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,761
Now stop your nonsense.

1383
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,536
Are you going to beat me, too?

1384
01:28:57,604 --> 01:29:00,903
I just wanted to stop that babbling.

1385
01:29:00,974 --> 01:29:04,000
Do you think I'm calm just because
I came in here calmly?

1386
01:29:04,077 --> 01:29:06,977
What do you think I've been doing
for the past three days?

1387
01:29:07,046 --> 01:29:08,513
I've been waiting for you.

1388
01:29:08,581 --> 01:29:11,641
I didn't have your telephone number.
I didn't think I had to know it.

1389
01:29:11,717 --> 01:29:13,810
I didn't have your address.

1390
01:29:13,886 --> 01:29:16,514
I didn't think I had to know that, either.

1391
01:29:16,589 --> 01:29:18,614
For three and a half months
I didn't see you.

1392
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:22,388
Well, I don't think
I missed you as much then

1393
01:29:22,461 --> 01:29:25,486
as when you kept away
from me for one day.

1394
01:29:25,563 --> 01:29:27,793
My thoughts were constantly on you

1395
01:29:27,865 --> 01:29:30,129
in my room at the hospital,
everywhere.

1396
01:29:30,201 --> 01:29:33,068
I sat with Morozov
and pictured you walking in.

1397
01:29:33,137 --> 01:29:34,195
But you didn't come.

1398
01:29:34,272 --> 01:29:37,332
I stared at the phone until I could have
smashed it on the floor.

1399
01:29:37,408 --> 01:29:39,205
But you didn't call.

1400
01:29:39,277 --> 01:29:41,211
Then everything became clear to me.

1401
01:29:41,279 --> 01:29:43,509
I knew you wouldn't come,
only I hadn't wanted to believe it.

1402
01:29:43,581 --> 01:29:45,878
You had made sure of me,

1403
01:29:45,949 --> 01:29:48,349
then you could afford
to take your time.

1404
01:29:49,886 --> 01:29:53,049
There was someone else.

1405
01:29:53,123 --> 01:29:56,684
Not only someone else,
but another life, as well.

1406
01:29:57,894 --> 01:30:02,194
This life, that you want me to share.

1407
01:30:06,269 --> 01:30:08,737
So, you'll break it off and go.

1408
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,362
As simple as that.

1409
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:12,873
You didn't want to know anything,
and I loved you for it.

1410
01:30:12,942 --> 01:30:14,503
And now... now you come
and reproach me.

1411
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,035
What do you want of me, anyway?
What rights have you?

1412
01:30:17,113 --> 01:30:19,707
None. I thought you had come back.

1413
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:24,875
Well, didn't I?

1414
01:30:24,953 --> 01:30:28,980
You came to me,
but you did not come back.

1415
01:30:29,057 --> 01:30:30,684
Ravic, listen to me.

1416
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:39,391
While you were in Switzerland, I waited.

1417
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,662
I waited, and there was nothing.

1418
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:48,273
Then, one day, someone came...

1419
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,833
who wanted me.

1420
01:30:50,911 --> 01:30:52,674
Nothing but me.

1421
01:30:52,746 --> 01:30:55,476
Wholly and forever.

1422
01:30:55,549 --> 01:30:57,574
It was like a landslide,

1423
01:30:57,651 --> 01:31:00,381
which one laughs at in the beginning.

1424
01:31:00,454 --> 01:31:02,421
Then, suddenly,

1425
01:31:02,488 --> 01:31:05,457
there's nothing left to hold onto...

1426
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:09,188
when one can't resist any longer.

1427
01:31:09,262 --> 01:31:10,923
Don't you understand?

1428
01:31:10,997 --> 01:31:12,464
Oh, yes.

1429
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,863
I knew.

1430
01:31:15,935 --> 01:31:17,368
I knew it.

1431
01:31:17,437 --> 01:31:19,632
It's quite easy to understand.

1432
01:31:21,573 --> 01:31:23,666
Beside you, he's nothing.

1433
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:26,844
I knew that the minute I saw you.

1434
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:31,374
I know I must break with him, but...

1435
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:34,078
I need time.

1436
01:31:34,152 --> 01:31:36,120
L... I can't do it right away.

1437
01:31:36,188 --> 01:31:39,055
You see how generous he has been.

1438
01:31:39,124 --> 01:31:41,785
I didn't know if you
would ever come back.

1439
01:31:45,596 --> 01:31:48,360
We were to be married.

1440
01:31:48,432 --> 01:31:50,229
Oh, Ravic, help me.

1441
01:31:50,301 --> 01:31:51,734
How can I help you?

1442
01:31:51,802 --> 01:31:53,030
By leaving you alone?

1443
01:31:53,104 --> 01:31:55,299
No, I mustn't lose you!
I can't lose you!

1444
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:57,170
Then what do you want me to do?

1445
01:32:03,646 --> 01:32:06,012
Give me time.

1446
01:32:06,082 --> 01:32:08,346
Wait for me.

1447
01:32:08,418 --> 01:32:09,578
Wait for you?

1448
01:32:09,652 --> 01:32:11,381
Yes, wait for me.

1449
01:32:11,454 --> 01:32:14,082
I'm a refugee.

1450
01:32:14,157 --> 01:32:16,284
It's my profession to wait,

1451
01:32:16,359 --> 01:32:18,849
to keep alive and wait.

1452
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:26,260
You'll come again, Ravic?

1453
01:32:26,335 --> 01:32:27,996
Don't think about it.

1454
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,765
Take your time.

1455
01:32:29,838 --> 01:32:31,829
You'll find out for yourself.

1456
01:33:58,989 --> 01:33:59,978
Good evening, sir.

1457
01:34:00,057 --> 01:34:03,458
Bring me hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of your driest wine.

1458
01:34:03,527 --> 01:34:05,859
- Yes, sir.
- Leave the menu.

1459
01:34:07,364 --> 01:34:08,854
Good evening, sir.

1460
01:34:08,932 --> 01:34:10,763
<i>Ja. Telephone this number.</i>

1461
01:34:10,834 --> 01:34:13,029
Ask for a Mr. Himmelstrutz.

1462
01:34:13,103 --> 01:34:14,967
- Give him this message.
- Yes, sir.

1463
01:34:15,037 --> 01:34:18,200
<i>And bring me a package
of Oziri zigarette.</i>

1464
01:34:18,274 --> 01:34:20,037
Gold tip.

1465
01:34:31,287 --> 01:34:33,379
Mr. Himmelstrutz, please.

1466
01:34:35,290 --> 01:34:36,882
Mr. Himmelstrutz?

1467
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:38,789
This is the chasseur at Fouquet's.

1468
01:34:38,860 --> 01:34:40,760
I have a message for you
from Mr. Haake.

1469
01:34:40,829 --> 01:34:42,729
Sorry. We have no Chesterfields.

1470
01:34:42,797 --> 01:34:44,958
Um, Laurents, Green.

1471
01:34:47,636 --> 01:34:51,504
A package of Oziri cigarette.
Gold tip.

1472
01:35:47,993 --> 01:35:48,925
Brandy, please.

1473
01:35:48,994 --> 01:35:50,153
Yes, sir.

1474
01:35:56,701 --> 01:35:57,929
Ravic.

1475
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:01,601
Don't you recognize me anymore?

1476
01:36:01,672 --> 01:36:03,469
How do you happen to be here?

1477
01:36:05,009 --> 01:36:06,874
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?

1478
01:36:06,944 --> 01:36:08,104
No. I'm waiting for someone.

1479
01:36:08,179 --> 01:36:09,668
You must leave me alone.

1480
01:36:11,381 --> 01:36:13,611
Not until I've seen what she looks like.

1481
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:16,779
Who?

1482
01:36:16,853 --> 01:36:18,980
The woman you're waiting for.

1483
01:36:21,858 --> 01:36:23,348
Don't do that.

1484
01:36:25,895 --> 01:36:26,919
Now I will wait.

1485
01:36:26,997 --> 01:36:28,964
Then sit somewhere else, please.

1486
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,633
But why are you doing this, Ravic?

1487
01:36:34,703 --> 01:36:36,330
You promised to wait for me.

1488
01:36:36,405 --> 01:36:39,465
You yourself said it would take time,
and it has only been two weeks.

1489
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:41,509
Only two weeks.

1490
01:36:41,577 --> 01:36:42,976
Well, I didn't come here by accident.

1491
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:44,910
I was looking for you.
Ravic, I must see you alone.

1492
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:46,174
- No.
- It's important.

1493
01:36:46,248 --> 01:36:48,647
- I must talk to you.
- Don't be a child.

1494
01:36:52,854 --> 01:36:54,116
I'm going to leave him.

1495
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:55,746
Yes, yes. You told me.

1496
01:36:55,823 --> 01:36:57,848
But I'm afraid.
He threatens me.

1497
01:36:57,925 --> 01:36:59,256
Hmm? What was that?

1498
01:36:59,327 --> 01:37:02,023
- He threatens me.
- Who?

1499
01:37:02,096 --> 01:37:04,394
Oh. Oh, I see.

1500
01:37:04,465 --> 01:37:06,365
I'm in danger.
He can be vicious, Ravic.

1501
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:08,060
Oh, you're not even listening to...

1502
01:37:09,870 --> 01:37:11,428
Wait. Just a moment.

1503
01:37:11,505 --> 01:37:12,437
- No.
- One second.

1504
01:37:12,506 --> 01:37:13,564
No.

1505
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:17,499
Sorry I'm late.

1506
01:37:17,577 --> 01:37:19,545
Doesn't matter.
I'm going home.

1507
01:37:19,613 --> 01:37:20,602
It was unavoidable.

1508
01:37:44,303 --> 01:37:45,894
Permit me, please.

1509
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,996
Permit me, please.
There is no other table.

1510
01:37:49,074 --> 01:37:50,803
Sit down, please.

1511
01:38:06,557 --> 01:38:07,581
Good morning!

1512
01:38:21,338 --> 01:38:22,896
I saw you while I was still inside.

1513
01:38:22,973 --> 01:38:24,667
I spotted you at once.

1514
01:38:26,509 --> 01:38:28,272
Oh, the scar.

1515
01:38:28,344 --> 01:38:30,175
It is a mark from a German student course.

1516
01:38:30,246 --> 01:38:33,943
So you are German
or so you have studied in Germany.

1517
01:38:36,853 --> 01:38:38,115
Correct?

1518
01:38:38,187 --> 01:38:39,449
Correct.

1519
01:38:39,522 --> 01:38:42,685
It is my business
to know these things.

1520
01:38:42,759 --> 01:38:44,225
- Cognac.
- Yes, sir.

1521
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:47,284
That is one good thing
they have here, is cognac.

1522
01:38:47,362 --> 01:38:48,920
Otherwise, all is decadent.

1523
01:38:48,997 --> 01:38:54,629
These people here only wish for lazy life.

1524
01:38:54,703 --> 01:38:56,068
Do you live here?

1525
01:38:56,138 --> 01:38:58,299
Yes.

1526
01:38:58,373 --> 01:38:59,635
Long time?

1527
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:00,766
Quite a while.

1528
01:39:03,544 --> 01:39:05,808
Permit me.

1529
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:07,472
Ivon Haake.

1530
01:39:07,548 --> 01:39:08,480
Holn.

1531
01:39:08,549 --> 01:39:10,483
- Von Holn?
- Yes.

1532
01:39:14,755 --> 01:39:18,782
You must know Paris well.

1533
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:20,724
Fairly well.

1534
01:39:20,795 --> 01:39:24,730
I do not mean the museums.

1535
01:39:24,798 --> 01:39:26,527
I know what you mean.

1536
01:39:28,067 --> 01:39:30,058
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1537
01:39:30,136 --> 01:39:31,262
I'll stick to this one.

1538
01:39:31,337 --> 01:39:32,599
So.

1539
01:39:41,079 --> 01:39:43,047
Chic.

1540
01:39:43,115 --> 01:39:46,016
These people here know all about that.

1541
01:39:46,084 --> 01:39:48,552
But these are nothing
compared to this woman

1542
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:49,882
you were talking to now.

1543
01:39:49,955 --> 01:39:51,479
You saw her?

1544
01:39:53,759 --> 01:39:55,522
Good acquaintance?

1545
01:39:55,594 --> 01:39:56,959
Yes.

1546
01:39:57,029 --> 01:39:58,189
Just that.

1547
01:39:58,263 --> 01:40:01,231
It is difficult here
to meet a woman like her.

1548
01:40:02,233 --> 01:40:03,222
It can be arranged.

1549
01:40:04,368 --> 01:40:06,461
So.

1550
01:40:06,537 --> 01:40:08,027
This woman is French?

1551
01:40:08,105 --> 01:40:09,697
Italian.

1552
01:40:09,774 --> 01:40:13,039
With a few other races mixed in.

1553
01:40:13,110 --> 01:40:15,738
Not bad.

1554
01:40:15,813 --> 01:40:18,338
Naturally, at home, we cannot have that.

1555
01:40:18,416 --> 01:40:19,347
But here...

1556
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:21,941
Here you are a tourist.

1557
01:40:29,626 --> 01:40:31,218
You understand!

1558
01:40:32,462 --> 01:40:34,089
Thank you, Herr Haake.

1559
01:40:36,733 --> 01:40:38,893
Do you have, uh...

1560
01:40:38,968 --> 01:40:42,165
<i>much contact mit refugees?</i>

1561
01:40:44,139 --> 01:40:45,572
Some.

1562
01:40:45,641 --> 01:40:49,509
We appreciate you know
certain informations?

1563
01:40:49,578 --> 01:40:51,205
We even pay for this.

1564
01:40:51,280 --> 01:40:53,646
Herr Ivon Haake,
you're not suggesting that...

1565
01:40:53,716 --> 01:40:56,014
Naturally, between men like you and me,

1566
01:40:56,085 --> 01:40:58,678
that is out of the question
unless it is a matter of honor.

1567
01:41:06,928 --> 01:41:08,862
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

1568
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,864
No, no, no, no, no.
Allow me.

1569
01:41:10,932 --> 01:41:12,490
In Paris, you're my guest.

1570
01:41:12,567 --> 01:41:14,262
Ten francs.

1571
01:41:14,335 --> 01:41:15,666
- You must go?
- Thank you.

1572
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:18,034
Well...

1573
01:41:18,105 --> 01:41:21,939
I thought I would
stroll about a bit tonight.

1574
01:41:22,009 --> 01:41:23,442
So?

1575
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:24,772
You know.

1576
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:28,872
There are things here for tourists
to see and learn.

1577
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:31,543
Tonight. Oh, what a pity.

1578
01:41:31,618 --> 01:41:33,711
I must go to Berlin tonight.

1579
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:35,687
I was just waiting here for two friends.

1580
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,416
Our baggage is already at the station.

1581
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:40,357
But maybe next time, huh?
I'll be back here in a few days.

1582
01:41:40,426 --> 01:41:42,553
I could call you up then.
Where do you live?

1583
01:41:42,628 --> 01:41:46,530
Uh, at the Prince de Galles,
just across the street.

1584
01:41:46,599 --> 01:41:48,362
Prince de Galles.

1585
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:58,304
Are these your friends?

1586
01:42:00,545 --> 01:42:02,137
Just on time.

1587
01:42:02,213 --> 01:42:04,147
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Herr von Holn.</i>

1588
01:42:04,215 --> 01:42:06,979
I am delighted to have met you,
and you will hear from me

1589
01:42:07,052 --> 01:42:08,849
sometime between
the 28th and the 5th,

1590
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,979
and discretion, of course.

1591
01:42:11,056 --> 01:42:11,988
Of course.

1592
01:42:12,057 --> 01:42:13,547
Between the 28th and the 5th.

1593
01:42:13,625 --> 01:42:14,649
Don't forget.

1594
01:42:14,725 --> 01:42:15,817
I never forget anything.

1595
01:42:15,893 --> 01:42:19,192
Neither an appointment or a face.

1596
01:42:19,263 --> 01:42:20,821
It's my profession.

1597
01:43:01,436 --> 01:43:02,869
Ravic.

1598
01:43:02,938 --> 01:43:04,530
Come right away.

1599
01:43:04,606 --> 01:43:06,369
Yes. No. Come right away, please.

1600
01:43:06,441 --> 01:43:07,772
L... I'm frightened.

1601
01:43:07,843 --> 01:43:10,710
Help me, Ravic.
Please come.

1602
01:43:10,779 --> 01:43:11,973
Yes.

1603
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:23,879
Joan.

1604
01:43:28,396 --> 01:43:29,727
Joan.

1605
01:43:33,767 --> 01:43:34,927
Oh, you're here.

1606
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,025
What happened?

1607
01:43:36,102 --> 01:43:37,501
Nothing.

1608
01:43:37,570 --> 01:43:39,663
I'm glad you still have
enough concern for me

1609
01:43:39,739 --> 01:43:41,229
to come when I call you.

1610
01:43:48,248 --> 01:43:50,045
So you lied to get me up here.

1611
01:43:50,116 --> 01:43:52,640
Yes. I had to see you.

1612
01:43:53,819 --> 01:43:57,220
And if I have to lie to see you,
I'll continue to lie.

1613
01:43:59,058 --> 01:44:01,151
You acted very strangely at Fouquet's.

1614
01:44:01,226 --> 01:44:03,854
It was like telling me that everything
was over between us.

1615
01:44:03,929 --> 01:44:05,521
It is.

1616
01:44:11,069 --> 01:44:12,195
You needn't do that.

1617
01:44:12,270 --> 01:44:14,397
I'm not going, not this time.

1618
01:44:14,472 --> 01:44:17,839
Not until I make you understand
that the book is closed.

1619
01:44:17,909 --> 01:44:19,171
It is not closed.

1620
01:44:19,243 --> 01:44:21,507
I can't bring myself to marry Alex.

1621
01:44:21,579 --> 01:44:23,069
I love you.

1622
01:44:25,083 --> 01:44:27,950
And I'll always love you.

1623
01:44:28,019 --> 01:44:29,781
And you love me.

1624
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:31,616
Yes.

1625
01:44:31,688 --> 01:44:33,781
But I have broken away from you.

1626
01:44:36,026 --> 01:44:39,291
Are we automatons
that we can turn love on and off?

1627
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:42,263
We were finished when I returned
from Switzerland.

1628
01:44:42,332 --> 01:44:44,300
I knew it then.
I should have broken off then.

1629
01:44:44,367 --> 01:44:48,326
I should have broken off
the first time you brought me here,

1630
01:44:48,405 --> 01:44:50,395
but I wasn't sure.

1631
01:44:50,473 --> 01:44:51,940
No one can prophesy.

1632
01:44:53,275 --> 01:44:55,743
And sometimes one doesn't
want to know everything.

1633
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:19,495
I can't imagine our never being together.

1634
01:45:22,403 --> 01:45:25,600
For a time, yes, but not forever.

1635
01:45:25,673 --> 01:45:27,867
You know you will leave me again...

1636
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:31,104
tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
sometime.

1637
01:45:36,483 --> 01:45:37,848
Yes.

1638
01:45:37,918 --> 01:45:39,613
And if you returned,

1639
01:45:39,686 --> 01:45:41,984
you know you would always go again.

1640
01:45:43,924 --> 01:45:45,323
Yes.

1641
01:45:47,026 --> 01:45:49,221
Yes, yes, yes!

1642
01:45:50,763 --> 01:45:52,754
Oh, what's the use?

1643
01:45:54,167 --> 01:45:57,603
What is it?
Why is it that way with us?

1644
01:45:57,670 --> 01:45:59,604
It's not only us.

1645
01:45:59,672 --> 01:46:03,335
Everyone searches for security in love.

1646
01:46:03,409 --> 01:46:06,605
You found them both,
but in two different men.

1647
01:46:06,678 --> 01:46:09,044
You want the one, and you don't
want to let the other go.

1648
01:46:09,114 --> 01:46:11,344
Yes, I would, Ravic.
I want only...

1649
01:46:11,416 --> 01:46:13,884
only I'm afraid.

1650
01:46:13,952 --> 01:46:16,785
I'd afraid of letting my love for you
do to me what it did...

1651
01:46:16,855 --> 01:46:19,153
what it did before,

1652
01:46:19,224 --> 01:46:21,920
when you were taken away from me,

1653
01:46:21,993 --> 01:46:23,824
when you were deported.

1654
01:46:25,963 --> 01:46:29,023
I can't, I can't be hurt like that again.

1655
01:46:35,906 --> 01:46:37,339
Can't we...

1656
01:46:37,408 --> 01:46:39,467
Can't we at least...

1657
01:46:39,543 --> 01:46:42,808
A former-Iover friendship? No.

1658
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,246
Might be possible with some people.

1659
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:49,410
A love like ours has no substitute.

1660
01:46:49,485 --> 01:46:52,454
Pain is part of it.

1661
01:46:52,522 --> 01:46:54,456
I can't.

1662
01:46:54,524 --> 01:46:55,991
I can't.

1663
01:46:56,059 --> 01:46:56,991
I can't.

1664
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,288
I know.

1665
01:47:02,799 --> 01:47:04,766
That's why this is the end.

1666
01:47:16,211 --> 01:47:18,509
Ravic!

1667
01:47:35,963 --> 01:47:37,260
Hello.

1668
01:47:39,333 --> 01:47:40,561
Yes.

1669
01:47:40,635 --> 01:47:42,192
Yes, thank you.

1670
01:47:42,269 --> 01:47:43,998
I'm expecting him.

1671
01:48:02,421 --> 01:48:05,720
You certainly did not rent
one of the cheap suites.

1672
01:48:05,791 --> 01:48:09,488
Have you ever sat in a plush hole
the entire day and waited?

1673
01:48:09,561 --> 01:48:11,586
Longer, my boy, longer.

1674
01:48:11,664 --> 01:48:13,996
And remember, this is the first day only.

1675
01:48:14,066 --> 01:48:15,226
You may wait seven.

1676
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:17,201
You may wait 7,000. Look.

1677
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:21,538
France closed the German frontier today.

1678
01:48:24,042 --> 01:48:25,737
There's still a chance.

1679
01:48:25,810 --> 01:48:27,437
I'll wait the week out.

1680
01:48:27,512 --> 01:48:31,175
Did you have much trouble
getting in here without passport?

1681
01:48:31,249 --> 01:48:34,685
No. Night porters don't ask questions
in exclusive hotels.

1682
01:48:34,752 --> 01:48:36,344
What about the day fellows?

1683
01:48:36,421 --> 01:48:38,821
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1684
01:48:38,890 --> 01:48:41,585
If I had only thought
of asking Haake's Paris hotel.

1685
01:48:41,658 --> 01:48:43,455
I know. I know.

1686
01:48:43,527 --> 01:48:47,395
You are sitting here thinking
you have done everything wrong, eh?

1687
01:48:47,464 --> 01:48:48,954
- Forget it.
- Did you rent the car?

1688
01:48:49,032 --> 01:48:51,830
Oh, yes. Yes, Talbot with leather seats.

1689
01:48:51,902 --> 01:48:54,103
It's parked in the Rue de Berri,
opposite the Lancaster.

1690
01:48:54,104 --> 01:48:56,402
- Thank you.
- Remember, you have no license to drive.

1691
01:48:56,473 --> 01:48:58,736
That has never bothered me before.

1692
01:48:58,808 --> 01:49:03,802
I came here straight
from the International.

1693
01:49:03,879 --> 01:49:07,178
I left Joan in my room, crying.

1694
01:49:09,819 --> 01:49:11,047
Hello.

1695
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:12,348
One moment, please.

1696
01:49:12,421 --> 01:49:14,252
Do you know where
you'll want to take him?

1697
01:49:14,323 --> 01:49:15,756
Yes, I know a place.

1698
01:49:15,825 --> 01:49:17,156
Yes?

1699
01:49:17,226 --> 01:49:19,420
Yes, this is Herr von Holn.

1700
01:49:19,494 --> 01:49:22,657
The wine you ordered,
was it Liebfrauen '29?

1701
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:26,124
Yes. Open.

1702
01:49:26,201 --> 01:49:28,066
Room service.

1703
01:49:28,136 --> 01:49:29,728
Yeah.

1704
01:49:31,139 --> 01:49:34,302
I hope you do not attract attention.

1705
01:49:34,376 --> 01:49:37,538
No man in Paris eats in his room
unless he is sick.

1706
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:41,872
I wish I could come with you.

1707
01:49:41,949 --> 01:49:44,577
I'm glad you don't have to.

1708
01:49:44,651 --> 01:49:46,619
God bless your eyes.

1709
01:50:27,225 --> 01:50:28,817
They've invaded Poland.

1710
01:50:34,199 --> 01:50:35,688
Yes, it's started.

1711
01:50:35,766 --> 01:50:38,428
The whole city is deathly quiet.

1712
01:50:38,502 --> 01:50:42,734
Whole country is hoping against hope.

1713
01:50:42,807 --> 01:50:46,368
And here I am playing
this silly game of Indians.

1714
01:50:48,512 --> 01:50:51,845
If only Haake hasn't left Paris by now.

1715
01:50:51,916 --> 01:50:53,577
With the frontiers closed,

1716
01:50:53,651 --> 01:50:55,743
he may not even have come at all.

1717
01:50:55,819 --> 01:50:57,753
For four days now, I've...

1718
01:50:57,821 --> 01:51:01,587
Let's talk about something else.

1719
01:51:01,658 --> 01:51:02,682
Yes.

1720
01:51:02,759 --> 01:51:06,855
What do you really intend
to do about Joan?

1721
01:51:08,064 --> 01:51:09,258
Have you seen her again?

1722
01:51:09,332 --> 01:51:11,960
Every day she comes
to see me at International,

1723
01:51:12,035 --> 01:51:14,468
every night at Sheherazade.

1724
01:51:14,536 --> 01:51:17,198
She wants to make things right.

1725
01:51:17,272 --> 01:51:19,570
She is desperate.

1726
01:51:19,641 --> 01:51:21,506
Let's talk about something else.

1727
01:51:42,864 --> 01:51:44,092
We'll be blacked out.

1728
01:51:44,165 --> 01:51:47,293
It's just been announced over the radio
as a precaution against air raids.

1729
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:49,734
On the radio, they say
everything is precaution.

1730
01:51:49,804 --> 01:51:51,135
They say there will be no war.

1731
01:51:51,205 --> 01:51:53,172
They say they're about to negotiate.

1732
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:54,434
- Good evening, Miss Madou.
- Good evening.

1733
01:51:54,508 --> 01:51:56,772
- I want to see the colonel.
- I'll look for him.

1734
01:51:58,512 --> 01:51:59,774
Hey.

1735
01:51:59,846 --> 01:52:02,110
I cannot talk to her here in this uniform.

1736
01:52:02,182 --> 01:52:03,376
Tell her I see her outside.

1737
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:04,644
You can talk to her here.

1738
01:52:04,718 --> 01:52:06,208
Not a soul will be here tonight.

1739
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:07,275
Well...

1740
01:52:13,592 --> 01:52:15,526
- Please...
- There will be blackout any minute.

1741
01:52:15,594 --> 01:52:16,652
It was just announced.

1742
01:52:16,729 --> 01:52:18,026
- You're to hurry home.
- Please, Colonel...

1743
01:52:18,097 --> 01:52:19,257
You should not be out alone.

1744
01:52:19,331 --> 01:52:21,060
Where is he?

1745
01:52:21,133 --> 01:52:23,033
I do not know.

1746
01:52:23,102 --> 01:52:24,330
If they declare war,

1747
01:52:24,403 --> 01:52:26,337
they'll put Ravic
into a concentration camp.

1748
01:52:26,405 --> 01:52:28,999
You are the only one who can
give me a chance to see him.

1749
01:52:29,074 --> 01:52:31,064
Please, before it is too late.

1750
01:52:32,977 --> 01:52:34,501
All right, Joan.

1751
01:52:34,579 --> 01:52:35,705
If I see him.

1752
01:52:37,749 --> 01:52:38,909
I have your word?

1753
01:53:02,205 --> 01:53:04,366
Monsieur von Holn doesn't answer.

1754
01:53:04,441 --> 01:53:05,567
He must be in.

1755
01:53:05,642 --> 01:53:07,735
You'll keep ringing, please.

1756
01:53:21,791 --> 01:53:22,951
Where are you going?

1757
01:53:23,025 --> 01:53:24,151
To get my car.

1758
01:53:24,226 --> 01:53:25,625
You want to leave me.

1759
01:53:25,695 --> 01:53:27,287
No, no, no, no, no.
You wait here.

1760
01:53:28,630 --> 01:53:30,689
We closed up this place.

1761
01:53:30,765 --> 01:53:32,528
Wait here.

1762
01:53:45,880 --> 01:53:48,643
Tell me about this place
where we are going.

1763
01:53:48,716 --> 01:53:52,948
Well, select wines, exquisite service,

1764
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:55,420
unbelievably pleasant company...

1765
01:53:55,489 --> 01:53:57,889
Sounds wonderful, wonderful.

1766
01:53:59,059 --> 01:54:00,185
But not cheap.

1767
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:03,286
We Germans, you know,
limited foreign exchange.

1768
01:54:03,364 --> 01:54:07,459
Herr Ivon Haake, need I remind you
that in Paris you're my guest?

1769
01:54:07,533 --> 01:54:11,094
You are a true landsman.

1770
01:54:16,943 --> 01:54:18,205
It is 5:30.

1771
01:54:18,277 --> 01:54:19,301
Remember, good friend,

1772
01:54:19,379 --> 01:54:23,042
I must be in the
Gare du Nord by 9:00.

1773
01:54:23,116 --> 01:54:25,277
I will not see Paris again

1774
01:54:25,351 --> 01:54:30,447
until I, through this
Arch of Triumph, march.

1775
01:54:33,325 --> 01:54:35,520
We have nearly four hours.

1776
01:54:35,594 --> 01:54:37,960
You'll make it easily.

1777
01:55:10,493 --> 01:55:11,619
Where are we?

1778
01:55:11,695 --> 01:55:13,162
The Bois de Boulogne.

1779
01:55:13,229 --> 01:55:14,821
How long are we driving?

1780
01:55:14,898 --> 01:55:16,331
Oh, ten minutes.

1781
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:17,866
It has been longer.

1782
01:55:17,934 --> 01:55:19,060
Not much.

1783
01:55:19,135 --> 01:55:20,815
Before I was asleep, I looked at the time.

1784
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:22,428
We are driving more than half an hour.

1785
01:55:22,505 --> 01:55:25,029
Really? I didn't think it was so long.

1786
01:55:25,107 --> 01:55:26,096
We'll be there soon.

1787
01:55:26,175 --> 01:55:27,233
Where?

1788
01:55:27,309 --> 01:55:29,470
The place I told you about.

1789
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:32,371
Drive back.

1790
01:55:33,582 --> 01:55:35,243
<i>- Now?
- Ja.</i>

1791
01:55:37,286 --> 01:55:38,344
Why?

1792
01:55:38,420 --> 01:55:39,887
Drive back.

1793
01:55:41,423 --> 01:55:42,650
All right.

1794
01:55:48,730 --> 01:55:50,493
Do we go back?

1795
01:55:50,565 --> 01:55:51,827
Yes.

1796
01:57:39,734 --> 01:57:41,429
10 Downing Street.

1797
01:57:41,503 --> 01:57:45,997
This morning, the British
Ambassador in Berlin

1798
01:57:46,074 --> 01:57:50,170
handed the German government a final note,

1799
01:57:50,245 --> 01:57:55,808
stating that unless we heard
from them by 11:00

1800
01:57:55,884 --> 01:57:58,078
that they were prepared at once

1801
01:57:58,152 --> 01:58:01,053
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1802
01:58:01,121 --> 01:58:05,558
a state of war would exist between us.

1803
01:58:05,626 --> 01:58:07,821
I have to tell you now

1804
01:58:07,895 --> 01:58:11,456
that no such undertaking
has been received,

1805
01:58:11,532 --> 01:58:13,557
and that consequently

1806
01:58:13,634 --> 01:58:17,501
this country is at war with Germany.

1807
01:58:23,176 --> 01:58:24,575
You heard?

1808
01:58:24,644 --> 01:58:26,236
Well?

1809
01:58:26,312 --> 01:58:30,578
I killed him in the Bois
and buried him in Saint-Germain.

1810
01:58:30,650 --> 01:58:32,208
Where is the car?

1811
01:58:33,887 --> 01:58:36,047
Rue Poncelet.

1812
01:58:36,121 --> 01:58:37,520
Everything is in order.

1813
01:58:37,589 --> 01:58:39,523
Nothing else to do?

1814
01:58:39,591 --> 01:58:41,582
Nothing.

1815
01:58:41,660 --> 01:58:44,151
I've got an horrific headache.

1816
01:58:44,229 --> 01:58:46,527
I want to sleep.
I'll come down later.

1817
01:58:46,598 --> 01:58:48,361
You did not forget anything?

1818
01:58:48,433 --> 01:58:50,458
No, I don't think so.

1819
01:58:50,535 --> 01:58:54,631
I've given up my room
at the Prince de Galles.

1820
01:58:54,706 --> 01:58:58,141
Madame Favier gave me
my old place here.

1821
01:58:58,209 --> 01:59:00,234
I can't go over the whole thing now.

1822
01:59:00,311 --> 01:59:01,744
First, I must sleep.

1823
01:59:01,812 --> 01:59:04,645
Did he ever find out who you were?

1824
01:59:04,715 --> 01:59:08,378
He didn't know who or why.

1825
01:59:26,903 --> 01:59:28,598
Ravic?

1826
01:59:28,672 --> 01:59:31,038
Hello? Ravic?

1827
01:59:31,107 --> 01:59:33,234
Answer me.

1828
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:36,870
The colonel told me you're there.

1829
01:59:36,946 --> 01:59:39,676
I'm back at the Milan,

1830
01:59:39,748 --> 01:59:42,945
where you first brought me.

1831
01:59:43,018 --> 01:59:46,146
L... I've left him, Ravic,

1832
01:59:46,221 --> 01:59:49,384
and he's hurt me badly.

1833
01:59:49,458 --> 01:59:53,393
Come. Come quickly.

1834
01:59:53,461 --> 01:59:55,019
Quickly.

1835
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:02,597
Dr. Ravic. Dr. Ravic.

1836
02:00:02,670 --> 02:00:04,262
Dr. Ravic, wake up.
You must wake up.

1837
02:00:04,339 --> 02:00:06,534
- Please do wake up.
- What do you want?

1838
02:00:06,607 --> 02:00:07,972
You must come immediately.

1839
02:00:08,042 --> 02:00:09,600
- It's Joan.
- What?

1840
02:00:09,677 --> 02:00:11,440
It was an accident.

1841
02:00:11,512 --> 02:00:13,775
You can't put the light on.
There's a blackout.

1842
02:00:13,847 --> 02:00:16,645
If I have to put a light on,
I'll put a light on.

1843
02:00:16,717 --> 02:00:17,798
Have you a taxi downstairs?

1844
02:00:17,851 --> 02:00:19,682
I have my car.

1845
02:00:19,753 --> 02:00:21,050
I shot her.

1846
02:00:22,656 --> 02:00:25,090
I pleaded with her not to leave me.

1847
02:00:25,158 --> 02:00:26,955
I only meant to threaten her.

1848
02:00:30,998 --> 02:00:32,259
What about the police?

1849
02:00:32,331 --> 02:00:33,628
No one heard me.

1850
02:00:33,699 --> 02:00:35,929
- Get my case together.
- Yes.

1851
02:01:16,507 --> 02:01:18,532
How did you get on the bed?

1852
02:01:18,609 --> 02:01:21,737
Alex. I couldn't walk.

1853
02:01:21,812 --> 02:01:24,645
Just after I telephoned you, I couldn't...

1854
02:01:24,715 --> 02:01:27,582
I couldn't move my leg or my arm.

1855
02:01:27,651 --> 02:01:29,447
What is it, Ravic?

1856
02:01:30,953 --> 02:01:32,079
Are you in pain?

1857
02:01:32,155 --> 02:01:33,247
Yes.

1858
02:01:33,322 --> 02:01:35,256
I'll give you something in a minute.

1859
02:01:39,095 --> 02:01:42,826
Call up Passy 2741.

1860
02:01:42,899 --> 02:01:43,923
Order an ambulance.

1861
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,194
Yes.

1862
02:01:47,236 --> 02:01:48,395
Hello.

1863
02:01:48,470 --> 02:01:51,337
Passy 2741.

1864
02:01:51,406 --> 02:01:53,670
What is it, Ravic?

1865
02:01:53,742 --> 02:01:55,266
Nothing bad.

1866
02:01:55,343 --> 02:01:57,174
Send an ambulance immediately.

1867
02:01:57,245 --> 02:01:59,145
Hotel de Milan.

1868
02:01:59,214 --> 02:02:01,648
Rue Cardinal.

1869
02:02:01,716 --> 02:02:02,808
Room 8.

1870
02:02:07,388 --> 02:02:10,186
I don't want to be operated on.

1871
02:02:10,257 --> 02:02:12,418
Maybe we won't have to.

1872
02:02:14,495 --> 02:02:15,757
Is it serious?

1873
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:18,458
No. Nothing serious.

1874
02:02:18,532 --> 02:02:20,591
They said the ambulance is coming.

1875
02:02:20,668 --> 02:02:23,535
Call up Auteuil 1357.

1876
02:02:23,604 --> 02:02:25,629
It's a hospital.
I'll talk to them.

1877
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:28,163
1357.

1878
02:02:28,241 --> 02:02:29,367
Hello.

1879
02:02:30,877 --> 02:02:33,471
Auteuil 1357.

1880
02:02:33,546 --> 02:02:35,138
Ravic.

1881
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:38,241
I don't want...

1882
02:02:38,318 --> 02:02:39,979
I don't want to have pain.

1883
02:02:40,053 --> 02:02:41,281
You won't.

1884
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:44,255
I can't... I can't endure... I can't...

1885
02:02:44,324 --> 02:02:46,484
Doctor, it's the hospital.

1886
02:02:46,558 --> 02:02:48,458
All right. I'll be right there.

1887
02:02:48,527 --> 02:02:50,688
Hold it for a second.

1888
02:03:05,476 --> 02:03:06,807
All done.

1889
02:03:10,781 --> 02:03:12,180
Hello.

1890
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:13,774
Hello, Geni?

1891
02:03:13,851 --> 02:03:16,081
Yes. Yes, a room.

1892
02:03:16,154 --> 02:03:18,714
And call up Veber.

1893
02:03:19,991 --> 02:03:23,825
Yes. Yes, have everything ready.

1894
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:25,191
All right.

1895
02:03:25,262 --> 02:03:27,321
I've ordered an ambulance.

1896
02:03:28,999 --> 02:03:31,490
Yes. In ten minutes.

1897
02:03:31,568 --> 02:03:34,002
Oh, darling, darling,

1898
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:36,436
I don't know what happened.

1899
02:03:36,506 --> 02:03:37,734
I don't know what happened.

1900
02:03:49,118 --> 02:03:50,415
I don't know...

1901
02:03:50,486 --> 02:03:51,851
Get up.

1902
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:57,081
I didn't mean to do it.

1903
02:03:57,159 --> 02:03:58,820
Believe me, I didn't mean to do it.

1904
02:03:58,894 --> 02:04:00,885
Go down and wait for the ambulance.

1905
02:04:02,031 --> 02:04:03,224
Go on.

1906
02:04:13,208 --> 02:04:15,039
You'll help me.

1907
02:04:15,109 --> 02:04:17,669
Yes.

1908
02:04:17,745 --> 02:04:19,406
You're here.

1909
02:04:21,316 --> 02:04:26,150
I'm always at peace when I'm with you.

1910
02:05:02,787 --> 02:05:04,049
If you like, I'll call Baudet.

1911
02:05:04,122 --> 02:05:06,454
He could be here in 15 minutes.

1912
02:05:06,524 --> 02:05:09,220
You can assist him,
and he can do it.

1913
02:05:11,196 --> 02:05:13,756
No. No, it's too late.

1914
02:05:13,832 --> 02:05:15,265
I couldn't anyway.

1915
02:05:15,333 --> 02:05:17,597
Looking on would be worse.

1916
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:07,573
Ravic.

1917
02:06:07,649 --> 02:06:08,843
Are you here?

1918
02:06:16,091 --> 02:06:17,455
Yes.

1919
02:06:17,525 --> 02:06:19,652
Did you operate?

1920
02:06:22,029 --> 02:06:24,088
No.

1921
02:06:24,165 --> 02:06:26,360
It wasn't necessary.

1922
02:06:33,607 --> 02:06:35,541
Will you stay with me?

1923
02:06:35,609 --> 02:06:37,098
Yes.

1924
02:06:38,912 --> 02:06:41,107
Headache.

1925
02:06:41,181 --> 02:06:43,649
Oh, it feels like lead.

1926
02:06:43,717 --> 02:06:46,311
You'll be better soon.

1927
02:06:46,386 --> 02:06:49,321
Oh, it didn't ache so much before.

1928
02:06:49,389 --> 02:06:52,825
Oh, I don't want to suffer.

1929
02:06:52,892 --> 02:06:55,985
Ravic, promise I won't suffer.

1930
02:06:57,763 --> 02:07:00,698
My grandmother. I saw her.

1931
02:07:02,434 --> 02:07:05,369
I don't want that. Promise.

1932
02:07:05,437 --> 02:07:07,234
I promise.

1933
02:07:11,543 --> 02:07:13,101
What's wrong with my arm?

1934
02:07:14,980 --> 02:07:16,276
It will come back again.

1935
02:07:16,347 --> 02:07:18,508
And my leg.

1936
02:07:18,583 --> 02:07:19,880
It's the same.

1937
02:07:23,955 --> 02:07:28,153
Oh, I just intended to begin

1938
02:07:28,226 --> 02:07:30,990
to live differently.

1939
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:39,769
What would have happened
without you?

1940
02:07:46,143 --> 02:07:48,407
Doctor, how is she?

1941
02:07:48,478 --> 02:07:50,708
I'm going in and find out.

1942
02:07:58,521 --> 02:08:00,785
The one time when I'm most needed,

1943
02:08:00,856 --> 02:08:04,348
all that I know,
all that I've learned, is nothing.

1944
02:08:11,700 --> 02:08:14,361
Poor France.

1945
02:08:14,436 --> 02:08:17,872
Yes, poor France.

1946
02:08:17,939 --> 02:08:20,669
And I'm afraid it's more
than France, Veber.

1947
02:08:20,742 --> 02:08:22,801
For me, it's France.

1948
02:08:22,877 --> 02:08:23,866
Of course.

1949
02:08:33,654 --> 02:08:34,746
Ravic.

1950
02:08:34,822 --> 02:08:36,187
I'm here, Joan.

1951
02:08:40,227 --> 02:08:43,663
What's the matter with my legs?

1952
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:46,221
I can't move either one of them anymore.

1953
02:08:47,768 --> 02:08:51,328
You'll be able to walk as always
as soon as you get up again.

1954
02:08:55,875 --> 02:08:57,934
You don't have to lie.

1955
02:08:59,345 --> 02:09:02,712
You mustn't let me live

1956
02:09:02,782 --> 02:09:05,717
when I'm nothing but pain.

1957
02:09:05,785 --> 02:09:09,186
You must give me something strong,

1958
02:09:09,255 --> 02:09:12,280
strong enough for heaven.

1959
02:09:13,792 --> 02:09:15,487
You must do it,

1960
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:18,723
even if I don't want you to.

1961
02:09:20,131 --> 02:09:21,291
Promise.

1962
02:09:21,366 --> 02:09:22,993
Joan...

1963
02:09:25,837 --> 02:09:28,806
It's all right for you to do it.

1964
02:09:28,874 --> 02:09:31,535
Without you,

1965
02:09:31,609 --> 02:09:33,804
I wouldn't be alive anyway.

1966
02:09:36,313 --> 02:09:38,747
You gave me this year.

1967
02:09:42,286 --> 02:09:46,746
Why didn't I stay with you?

1968
02:09:47,892 --> 02:09:49,882
It was my fault, Joan.

1969
02:09:49,959 --> 02:09:53,360
No.

1970
02:09:53,429 --> 02:09:56,421
It was... It was...

1971
02:09:56,499 --> 02:09:58,660
Oh, I don't know.

1972
02:09:58,735 --> 02:10:01,101
My head...

1973
02:10:01,170 --> 02:10:02,262
a light...

1974
02:10:02,338 --> 02:10:05,273
my eyes...

1975
02:10:20,589 --> 02:10:22,454
My eyes...

1976
02:10:28,829 --> 02:10:30,956
So much to tell you.

1977
02:10:31,032 --> 02:10:32,693
Later.

1978
02:10:32,767 --> 02:10:33,961
Later.

1979
02:10:35,736 --> 02:10:39,763
There's no more time to explain.

1980
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,865
I think I know most of it.

1981
02:10:45,313 --> 02:10:46,337
You know?

1982
02:10:46,414 --> 02:10:48,381
I think so.

1983
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:51,440
You know that I always...

1984
02:10:51,518 --> 02:10:54,681
Yes, Joan.

1985
02:10:54,754 --> 02:10:56,346
Strange.

1986
02:10:58,124 --> 02:11:00,524
It's strange to die...

1987
02:11:03,330 --> 02:11:06,321
when you love.

1988
02:11:06,398 --> 02:11:09,492
You are my life.

1989
02:11:09,568 --> 02:11:12,332
My arm.

1990
02:11:12,404 --> 02:11:15,032
My arm can never embrace you.

1991
02:11:15,107 --> 02:11:19,601
You are in my arms and I in yours.

1992
02:11:27,919 --> 02:11:29,546
I understand you.

1993
02:11:38,963 --> 02:11:41,431
"Love" is no word for it.

1994
02:11:41,499 --> 02:11:43,831
It isn't enough.
It's a small part only.

1995
02:11:43,901 --> 02:11:45,731
It is so much more.

1996
02:11:55,345 --> 02:11:56,869
Yes.

1997
02:11:56,947 --> 02:11:59,279
Yes, you are always with me,

1998
02:11:59,349 --> 02:12:01,510
no matter whether
I loved you, hated you,

1999
02:12:01,585 --> 02:12:03,382
or seemed indifferent.

2000
02:12:03,453 --> 02:12:06,421
That never changed anything.

2001
02:12:16,732 --> 02:12:18,723
You are always with me.

2002
02:12:30,578 --> 02:12:32,239
Ravic.

2003
02:12:34,449 --> 02:12:38,283
I was only more lost without you.

2004
02:12:38,353 --> 02:12:41,516
You were all the brightness

2005
02:12:41,589 --> 02:12:45,718
and the sweet and the bitter.

2006
02:12:55,836 --> 02:12:57,326
Doctor.

2007
02:12:58,539 --> 02:12:59,972
Dr. Ravic.

2008
02:13:02,008 --> 02:13:04,670
The patient in number 12 is dead.

2009
02:13:04,744 --> 02:13:06,234
You may notify the police.

2010
02:13:06,312 --> 02:13:07,574
Very well.

2011
02:13:14,287 --> 02:13:15,219
Do you live here?

2012
02:13:15,288 --> 02:13:16,220
Yes.

2013
02:13:16,289 --> 02:13:19,087
Take your place in line, please.

2014
02:13:19,158 --> 02:13:21,387
Hello, Boris. You, too?

2015
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:24,258
This war, they want to see
everybody's papers.

2016
02:13:24,329 --> 02:13:26,524
I was asleep, idiot that I am.

2017
02:13:26,598 --> 02:13:28,031
I could have warned you.

2018
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:29,260
I'm through running.

2019
02:13:30,869 --> 02:13:31,858
Next.

2020
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:35,230
You know where they will put you.

2021
02:13:35,307 --> 02:13:36,934
I've been there before.

2022
02:13:37,008 --> 02:13:38,873
There is rumor they are going to set up

2023
02:13:38,944 --> 02:13:41,309
concentration camp at Longchamp.

2024
02:13:41,378 --> 02:13:43,846
Maybe they'll set us free again soon.

2025
02:13:43,914 --> 02:13:45,643
We can be used.

2026
02:13:45,716 --> 02:13:47,581
This is the end of our waiting, Boris.

2027
02:13:47,651 --> 02:13:48,743
- Next.
- Oh, no.

2028
02:13:48,819 --> 02:13:50,377
Not so fast.

2029
02:13:50,454 --> 02:13:52,012
Perhaps not.

2030
02:13:52,089 --> 02:13:54,353
But you will see the day.

2031
02:13:54,425 --> 02:13:55,449
Next.

2032
02:13:59,829 --> 02:14:00,853
Boris.

2033
02:14:02,665 --> 02:14:05,293
Joan is dead, shot by a man.

2034
02:14:05,368 --> 02:14:07,302
She is in Veber's hospital.

2035
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:10,601
Will you see that she's buried?

2036
02:14:10,673 --> 02:14:12,664
No, don't ask questions.

2037
02:14:12,742 --> 02:14:15,074
Just say yes and be done with it.

2038
02:14:15,145 --> 02:14:17,443
- Yes.
- Next.

2039
02:14:17,514 --> 02:14:20,414
And take any of my things
that you can use.

2040
02:14:20,482 --> 02:14:21,915
Move into my room.

2041
02:14:21,984 --> 02:14:24,316
You always wanted my shower anyway.

2042
02:14:24,386 --> 02:14:25,648
All right.

2043
02:14:25,721 --> 02:14:28,212
After the war,
I will meet you at Fouquet's.

2044
02:14:28,290 --> 02:14:31,191
Which side, Champs-Elysées
or Georges V?

2045
02:14:32,261 --> 02:14:34,252
- Georges V.
- Good.

2046
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:39,322
No, come here, idiot.

2047
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,528
Don't we even dare
say good-bye decently?

2048
02:14:47,108 --> 02:14:49,269
God bless your eyes.

2049

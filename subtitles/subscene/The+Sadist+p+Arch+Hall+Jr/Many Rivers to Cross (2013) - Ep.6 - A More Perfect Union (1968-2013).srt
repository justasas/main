10
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,529

beloved symbol
of the civil rights struggle,

shattered African Americans'
faith that racial equality

could ever be won
through peaceful protest.

never believed in nonviolence,

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,510
of that method of solving

To some extent,
Dr. King has been a buffer

nonviolence versus violence,

00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,524
I created it
as a way to reaffirm

179
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,534
our rootedness in our own
culture, African culture.

180
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,366
Malcolm said it-Until we have
a cultural revolution

181
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,804
to un-brainwash
a whole people,

182
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,002
we cannot break the bonds
of white supremacy,

183
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:07,602
because it begins first
in the mind.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,672
You've got to
decolonize the mind.

185
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,718
10 years before, you could
have had the same idea,

186
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,377
and it would have
fallen ﬂat.

187
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,977
You know that
as well as I.

188
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,252
But what was it
about this moment

189
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,953
that let the seeds
that you planted blossom?

190
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,893
Remember, this is
the black power movement,

191
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,521
and black was sacred.

192
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:27,361
Ha ha ha ha!

193
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,866
It became
a movement holiday,

194
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,870
and as the movement grew,
it grew.

195
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,268
Wearing my natural

196
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,900
gives me more power
within myself.

197
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,274
Isn't it beautiful?

198
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:43,909
MAN: What are you?

199
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,645
I'm black and beautiful.

200
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,584
ROSE: "Black is beautiful"
was an effort

201
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:50,815
to sort of throw off
the shackles of

202
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,382
the way white supremacy
constructed black bodies-

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,894
they're not as intelligent,
they're not human,

204
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,761
they're not as beautiful,
they're not valued.

205
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,857
So to undo that,

206
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,200
one has to directly attack
that ideology.

207
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,105
GATES: "Black is Beautiful"

208
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,941
came out of
the black power movement...

209
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,480
Right on, brother.

210
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:20,451
But it quickly permeated the
American cultural mainstream.

211
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,513
Blackness, or soul,
became the epitome of cool...

212
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,717
Right on.

213
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,126
In popular films, music,
and advertising.

214
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,291
By 1969, there were
black characters

215
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,803
on 21 prime-time TV shows.

216
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,139
But more than
any other program,

217
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,644
the syndicated television show
"Soul Train,"

218
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:50,614
created and hosted by visionary
entrepreneur Don Cornelius,

219
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,244
helped spread the idea
that black was beautiful.

220
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,051
"Soul Train" brought black
music, dancing, and fashion

221
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,992
into homes across America.

222
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:05,656
For African American youth,
it was a revelation

223
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,963
to see kids like themselves
on national television.

224
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,834
THOMPSON: "Soul Train"
was pretty much the obsession

225
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,669
in every household
in my neighborhood.

226
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,834
I guess you could say
"Soul Train" was kind of

227
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,348
the first non-minstrel-based
black entertainment

228
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,408
that, you know,
America really got.

229
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,084
GATES:And it was more
than just music and dancing.

230
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,683
"Soul Train"
and its sponsors

231
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,558
advertised products
for black consumers

232
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,532
in ways that appealed to
their new pride and identity.

233
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,502
THOMPSON: Don Cornelius
used the commercials to educate

234
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,936
and promote afrocentricity,

235
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,668
which was something that was
absolutely not heard of.

236
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,676
There's one
with Frederick Douglass.

237
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,211
Teaching you
how to...yeah.

238
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,144
"My brother, you can't
go out looking like that."

239
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,047
Well, Mr. Douglass,
you know, times have changed.

240
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,641
We wear the natural now.

241
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,152
You call that a natural?

242
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,653
That's a mess.

243
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,089
THOMPSON: Kids used to tease you
by saying, "You're African."

244
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:07,716
"No, I'm not. I'm..."

245
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,556
You know, that was
the reason for a fight.

246
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,391
Someone called me African,
I'm beating somebody up.

247
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,900
Don Cornelius,
his master plan

248
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:18,232
was to change the lives
of black youth

249
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,862
without them knowing it.

250
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,840
I don't mean it lightly
when I say that

251
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,400
self-love was probably
the most important lesson

252
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,606
that was taught
on the sh ow.

253
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,080
[indistinct]

254
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,882
GATES: "Soul Train" made
black culture truly national

255
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,752
and kept it accessible
to the African Americans

256
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:41,384
who were moving out of their old
segregated neighborhoods

257
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,226
and integrating white suburbs
for the first time.

258
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:49,927
°Ashes, ashes,
we all fall down <i>°</i>

259
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,096
Professional opportunities
were opening up,

260
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:56,733
both in civil service
and in the private sector,

261
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:59,642
spurring the growth
of the black middle class.

262
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:04,911
The American dream was finally
coming within reach for some

263
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:09,114
thanks to a new idea
called Affirmative Action,

264
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,782
which prescribed
concrete policies

265
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,587
to end historic
discrimination.

266
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,992
You cannot explain
the significant increase

267
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,122
of middle-class blacks
in professional positions

268
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,292
and in colleges
and universities

269
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:26,304
without taking account
of these civil rights acts

270
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,135
and Affirmative Action programs.

271
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:31,176
It definitely
improved their life.

272
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:32,574
You and I
are prime examples.

273
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,771
Precisely, yeah.

274
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:43,317
GATES: In September 1969,

275
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,324
I drove to New Haven,
Connecticut,

276
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:50,829
a world away from my hometown,
Piedmont, West Virginia.

277
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,832
I was one of the lucky
96 black students

278
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,460
starting at Yale that fall,

279
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,495
a huge leap
from the 6 black men

280
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,509
who had graduated
in the class of '66,

281
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,738
just 3 years earlier.

282
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,337
Yale's president,
Kingman Brewster,

283
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,849
who had made
the bold decision

284
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,181
to open up
admissions policies,

285
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,713
greeted us with a speech
I'll never forget.

286
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,349
He said,
"Welcome to Yale.

287
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,189
"You're among
the intellectual elect.

288
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:25,856
"You are one of the 1,000
male leaders

289
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:29,628
brought into
the freshman class."

290
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,763
Our goal,
our revolutionary action

291
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,299
would be to integrate
the white power elite.

292
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,040
The other black students
I met at Yale were brilliant,

293
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,811
including future neurosurgeon
Dr. Ben Carson,

294
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,877
future United States
Congresswoman

295
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,854
Sheila Jackson Lee,

296
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,391
and Kurt Schmoke,
who would go on to become

297
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,053
the first black mayor
of Baltimore.

298
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:58,790
SCHMOKE: I thought of
our class coming in

299
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,833
as pan of what Dr. King
was talking about,

300
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,392
certainly what my grandmother
would wish for,

301
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,904
you know, that these
institutions were opening up

302
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:09,031
to African Americans.

303
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,339
Uh, somewhere in here.

304
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,742
Where's the mark?

305
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,211
There you go.

306
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,215
Affirmative Action,
for us,

307
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:21,219
was the first chance
we had to compete

308
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,221
with white boys,
our peers,

309
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,654
on a level
playing field.

310
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,089
You know, I never
considered myself

311
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,423
as being unqualified.
Right.

312
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,429
This was all about
inclusion.

313
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,695
This was about me being
a pan of and not apart from.

314
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,759
GATES: Integrating
the power elite

315
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:40,361
was just the beginning.

316
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,739
For us, black power meant
shaping Yale to meet our needs,

317
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,937
forming a black
student alliance,

318
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,946
and demanding new classes

319
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:53,110
emphasizing African American
history and culture.

320
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,283
But off campus,
the assertive stance

321
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,455
of the black power movement
had aroused fears,

322
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:10,059
fears that began to take
tangible form.

323
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,472
Calling the Panthers
"the greatest threat

324
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,974
to the internal security
of the country,"

325
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,476
the FBI launched
a secret campaign

326
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:24,573
of surveillance, infiltration,
and disinformation

327
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,110
aimed at seeding conﬂict
between the black power groups.

328
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,157
Were you aware of this
counterintelligence program

329
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,691
as it was going on?

330
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,784
We thought
they wanted to kill us.

331
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,726
What we didn't understand
is really

332
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,697
what they wanted to do
was confuse us,

333
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,326
to make us think our friends
were our enemies,

334
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,597
to make us lose confidence
in what we were doing.

335
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,299
Why would the FBI care

336
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:51,673
about the handful
of black people wearing berets

337
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,440
and the handful of
black people in dashikis?

338
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,844
You know, these
were not mass movements

339
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,176
where 20 million
black people,

340
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,580
you know, lined up
to join them.

341
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,380
Nobody really was threatened
by the Panthers.

342
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,818
Let's be honest.

343
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:04,856
Hoover wasn't
afraid of them,

344
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,391
and he wasn't
afraid of us.

345
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,689
He feared us
in our unity,

346
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,492
the potential of a unified
black movement,

347
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,862
self-conscious and armed.

348
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:18,369
GATES: In March 1972,

349
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,373
over 8,000 people,
including Cultural Nationalists,

350
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:26,537
Black Panthers, representatives
of the black arts movement,

351
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,637
mainstream civil rights
activists,

352
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,875
and elected officials
come together

353
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:35,648
in Gary, Indiana, intent on
defining a unified agenda

354
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,282
through the first national
black political convention.

355
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,117
What was the idea
behind this meeting?

356
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,790
There was a recognition that
protect politics wasn't enough.

357
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:49,891
You actually have to
struggle for power.

358
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:51,731
MAN: All right,
please, please, please.

359
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,898
In the interest--
Please. Now let's go.

360
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,964
KELLEY: One of the things
that Gary did reveal, though,

361
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,239
is that unity
is a hard thing.

362
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,075
MAN:The political agenda

363
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,580
that comes out
of this convention

364
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,708
has to be a nearly
unanimous document.

365
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,082
If it's not, it will
simply be ignored

366
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,677
by the major
political parties.

367
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,518
"Why is it that you all
don't agree?"

368
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,648
Yeah.

369
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,487
We have never had that
in the black community,

370
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,757
and it has never been true
in the white community.

371
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,798
But only we are
asked about it.

372
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,127
Ha ha ha.

373
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,930
Going and participating
did not necessarily mean

374
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,367
that you agree
with everything,

375
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,065
but not to be there

376
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,541
to witness this
and to be a pan of it

377
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,977
would have been,
for me, irresponsible.

378
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,742
All in favor
of adopting

379
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,612
the National Black Agenda

380
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,120
please signify
by raising your hands!

381
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:46,123
GATES: The participants united
across ideological lines

382
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,126
around the black community's
most crucial issue,

383
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,128
the longstanding
economic inequality

384
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:55,132
that the civil rights movement
hadn't been able to eradicate.

385
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,930
JACKSON: Now we find ourselves
with the right

386
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:01,131
to move in any neighborhood
in America,

387
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,300
and we can't pay the note.

388
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:08,472
We have the right to go
to any school in America.

389
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,311
We can't pay the tuition.

390
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,319
We've got the right
to buy any car in America.

391
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,151
<i>But we can't stop</i> it
<i>from being repossessed.</i>

392
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:21,659
We are not arguing about
our Constitutionality.

393
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,321
We are raising
a basic question--

394
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:29,265
when will we get paid for
the work we have already done?

395
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,461
[Cheering and applause]

396
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:39,938
BLACKWELL: In the Seventies,
we really had

397
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,173
a tale of three cities.

398
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,341
We have a few African Americans
who have achieved

399
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:48,511
real greatness
in terms of education,

400
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,181
in business, in politics.

401
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,316
Then you had
a black middle class

402
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,851
that had middle-class status,
middle-class ideals,

403
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,364
did not quite have
middle-class stability,

404
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,866
but middle class nonetheless.

405
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,701
And then you had a huge swath
of the black community

406
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:07,898
that was poor,

407
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,770
and its poverty
was worse

408
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,571
than the poverty
that preceded it.

409
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,710
GATES: During that time,
larger economic forces

410
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:24,381
were reshaping
the American landscape.

411
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,721
Industries were moving out
of the inner cities.

412
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,557
White people
and African Americans

413
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,722
who had made it
into the middle class

414
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,266
followed the jobs
to the suburbs.

415
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:39,134
The black poor
were left behind.

416
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,672
There's a big
difference, Skip,

417
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,038
between neighborhoods

418
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,545
in which a majority
of the adults are working,

419
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,241
like was the case,
say, back in 1950...

420
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,612
Mm-hmm.

421
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,243
And neighborhoods
in which a significant

422
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,617
majority of the adults
are not working.

423
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:00,180
Joblessness triggers problems
in a neighborhood-

424
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,252
family breakups,
drug trafficking, gangs.

425
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,024
What you're describing

426
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,589
is a perfect storm
for disaster

427
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,727
for the poorest element
of the African
American community.

428
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,100
Yeah, absolutely.

429
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,900
Well, what strikes me
as a paradox

430
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,907
is that all this
occurred

431
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,307
precisely as black
people were gaining

432
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:24,577
increasing political
power and efficacy
in the cities.

433
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:28,609
Being mayor of Gary
has not made it possible

434
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,781
for me to control
things like jobs

435
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:34,758
and the economic conditions
of black people.

436
00:21:34,826 --> 00:21:38,353
[Applause]

437
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,957
The unemployment rate
is 4 and 5 times greater

438
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:45,128
than the national unemployment
rate during the Depression.

439
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,228
[Applause]

440
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:50,130
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.

441
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,405
GATES: When my old friend from
Yale, Kurt Schmoke, was elected,

442
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,244
he, like the country's
other black mayors,

443
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,648
inherited a city
in decline

444
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,414
and abandoned
by the Federal government.

445
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,856
SCHMOKE: When I became mayor,
it was clear that we had

446
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,486
significant problems in
the African American community

447
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,292
that weren't being faced
in the white community.

448
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,663
I didn't realize,
however,

449
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,261
that the other thing
that I was gonna face

450
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,465
was the negative impacts
of the war on drugs.

451
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,499
NEWSMAN: President Reagan signed
a stiff new anti-drug law

452
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:29,513
authorizing $1.7 billion
to fight drug abuse.

453
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,775
REAGAN : The American people
want their government

454
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,714
to get tough
and go on the offensive,

455
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,911
And that's exactly
what we intend.

456
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,949
ALEXANDER: From the outset,
the war on drugs

457
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:46,123
had relatively little to do
with genuine concern

458
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,065
about people struggling with
drug addiction and drug abuse...

459
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,728
ANNOUNCER: This is
your brain on drugs.

460
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,930
And much to do
with politics...

461
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,029
Just say no.

462
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,540
Racial politics,

463
00:22:56,608 --> 00:23:01,568
using racially coded get-tough
political peals on issues

464
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,807
of crime and welfare

465
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,147
in order to appeal to poor
and working-class whites

466
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,653
who are anxious about
and resentful of

467
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,656
many of the gains
of African Americans

468
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,487
in the civil rights movement.

469
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,166
GATES: That war on drugs
would be waged

470
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,001
in African American
neighborhoods

471
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:32,169
like Harlem's Wagner Houses,
where Terrence Stevens grew up.

472
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,678
Were you aware
that the government

473
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,839
had declared
a war on drugs?

474
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,507
I knew that there was
a war on drugs

475
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,982
in the street
with law enforcement

476
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,985
because I remember,
as a kid,

477
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,578
we'd just be hanging out
in front of our buildings,

478
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:46,021
and the police
would come

479
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,524
and just throw everybody
up on the wall

480
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,889
and started
checking everybody.

481
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,518
They're running up
in these apartment buildings

482
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,789
with their guns out.

483
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,060
It had a devastating effect
on the black community.

484
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,292
GATES: In the mid-1980's,

485
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,305
inner-city neighborhoods
like Terrence's,

486
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:05,036
which were already struggling
to combat poverty and decay,

487
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,544
suffered a staggering blow.

488
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:10,206
STEVENS: Crack stole
the sh ow.

489
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,046
Crack just like
killed the game.

490
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,052
It was indescribable,

491
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,714
the level of hardships
and whatnot

492
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,189
that, you know,
people was experiencing.

493
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:24,422
They would be smoking
crack cocaine in a park.

494
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,396
You know, people
literally stealing TV's

495
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,932
out of your house,
you know.

496
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:32,834
Crack really hit
Harlem heavy.

497
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,997
The war on drugs
is focused on crack.

498
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,062
Let's go.

499
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,870
[Men shouting]

500
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,103
Police!

501
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,241
ALEXANDER: When crack
hit the streets,

502
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,946
The Reagan administration
seized on this development,

503
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,251
actually hiring staff
whose job it was

504
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,088
to publicize
inner-city crack babies...

505
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,184
Crack kids.

506
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,456
Crack dealers...

507
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,430
Get down
on your hands!

508
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,400
In an effort
to bolster public support

509
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,437
for a drug war
they had already declared.

510
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,598
NEWSMAN: The plan,
an all too familiar one.

511
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,073
It's an other night,
another crack raid.

512
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:15,670
ALEXANDER: There was such
a frenzy associated with

513
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,477
a fear of crack,
it served the function

514
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:23,283
of deflecting attention
away from problems of poverty,

515
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,915
of joblessness
in these communities...

516
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,481
Open n!

517
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,049
To crack.

518
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,790
MAN: Police are now arresting
more than 35 people a day

519
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,297
on drug charges,

520
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,334
but almost all
of these arrests

521
00:25:36,401 --> 00:25:38,335
are taking place
in black neighborhoods.

522
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,963
ALEXANDER: Even at the height
of the crack epidemic,

523
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,372
the majority of crack users
were white.

524
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,969
But once it became
sensationalized in the media

525
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:50,105
as a black drug,

526
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,617
a wave of punitiveness

Hurricane Katrina struck
the city of New Orleans.

698

In the ﬂoods
that followed,

699
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:46,180
about 1,500 people
lost their lives.

700
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,983
Hundreds of thousands

703
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,638
stayed in New Orleans
throughout the disaster.

704
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,040
Things were so hectic
that, you know,

705
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,376
guys just couldn't
arbitrarily go out
on their own

706
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:18,210
for fear of being
arrested

707
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,579
or maybe being
fired upon.

708
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:22,414

stranded by the ﬂoods.

00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,257
Do you have nightmares

Where these three--
they were sisters and brothers.

714
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,730
They were all dressed in white.
I'll never forget that.

715
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:45,743
And they were pouring water
down his mouth

716
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,903
and telling him,
"We're gonna make it.

717

We're almost there.
We're almost there."

718

They were bringing him

And I couldn't
take that either.

720
00:35:55,653 --> 00:36:00,249
I couldn't take it.
Excuse me.

Shouldn't the government
have been doing

were forced to do?

You can wait for government

724
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,096
but, I mean,
lives were at stake.

725
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,193
So you did what you knew
you could do.

The landscape

tragically,

736
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,389

irreversibly.

is that the President

is on Air Force One,
and they fly lower

so that they can
survey the damage.

744
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:13,491
People kept saying,
"This is not about race."

745
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,328
But for African American s,
it was hard to conceive

that there could be
800 white people dead

747

BLACKWELL: The government's
failure to respond

751
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,686
I don't think was just because
people were black

752

or just because
people were poor.

People were left
in that crisis

754
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:47,997
because they were
black and poor.

755
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:53,060
It was strictly because

passes a 3-strike law,

00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,866
the land where everything
is possible.

871
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,134
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

872
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,368
Thank you, sir.

873
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,434
[Cheering and applause]

874
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:45,313
GATES: Against
the greatest odds,

875
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:49,951
America sent a black man
to the White House.

876
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:58,830
In the euphoria that followed,
some even dared to wonder

877
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,268
was this the end
of racism?

878
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,672
Could 500 years
of race relations

879
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:10,806
be transformed
by the election of one man?

880
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,787
The idea that one
black President ended racism-

881
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,020
like...Aah!

882
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:26,324
Like, it was just like,
that's all it takes?

883
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,523
I think people
wanted to buy it.

884
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,792
And there was so much good
feeling around Barack

885
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,527
at that point
that we wanted to believe

886
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,034
that he was--you know,
it's the extension

887
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,660
of the magical negro
in the movies.

888
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:36,365
And that good feeling
led to claims

889
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,203
that somehow we had
turned a corner,

890
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:39,970
that we were
so-called post-racial.

891
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,137
America was founded
on racism.

892
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,646
The only way
we get to be post-racial

893
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,046
is the way that we got to be
post-dinosaur.

894
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:47,879
You know what I mean?
Like, a meteor has to hit

895
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,543
and just sort of wipe
everything out,

896
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,850
and then something else
has to replace America.

897
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,391
BLACKWELL: Attitudes are
improving about race.

898
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,552
All the polls show it.

899
00:44:57,628 --> 00:45:00,392
The American people
actually feel better

900
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,658
about people
who are different.

901
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,563
They feel better
about black people.

902
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:05,158
They have less racism.

903
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:09,228
But those personal attitudes
don't translate into change,

904
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:13,402
because the racism now
is institutionalized.

905
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:14,637
It's structural.

906
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,914
COBB: This African America
who is in the White House

907
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,574
occurs at a point
where there's

908
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,949
nearly a million black men
who are incarcerated,

909
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,079
at a point where
black unemployment

910
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:28,249
is routinely double that
of white unemployment,

911
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:31,260
at a point where there are
all these enduring indicators

912
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,660
of social, economic
inequality.

GATES: After almost a decade,
in a maximum-security prison,

914
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:41,603

915
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,106
who suffers from
muscular dystrophy,

916

granted him clemency,

917
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,674

to come home at last.

Getting ready to lift now.
Let's go.

922
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,621
I'm thinking about
writing a book

923

when I get out, too.

924
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,462
Well, you're out now.

925
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,968
Yeah, I'm out now.

926
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,197
Yeah, right.
"When I get out."
He's saying...

927
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,137
I'm so used to being in.

[Laughter]

929
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,972
Yeah, it's a beautiful
morning, though.

930
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,945
Ha ha ha!

931
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,984
It's funny, man.
I was locked up so long

932
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:31,714
that when I finally
got released...

933
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,656
I...l had a little phobia
about going outside,

934
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,164
because outside seemed
so huge, you know.

935
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,290
It seemed so huge.

no longer incarcerated,

937
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,480

that as a convicted felon,

938
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,348
he was not yet ﬂee.

939
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,354
There was a lot of things
that I couldn't do.

940
00:47:05,422 --> 00:47:06,787
You know, I couldn't vote.

Parole officers coming
to your house.

943
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:14,454
You have a curfew.

944
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:18,194
A lot of people, when they go
and apply for jobs,

945
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,361
they want to know
do you have a conviction,

946
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:23,531
and you write down, yes,
you have a conviction,

947
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:26,667
and now the employer
don't want to employ you.

948
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:30,543
Even after prison,
you're kind of still

949

ALEXANDER: I refer to the
system of mass incarceration

953
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,398
as a new Jim Crow,

954
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,566
because it is
a comprehensive system

955
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:01,099
that serves to lock
a group of people,

956
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,578
defined largely
by race and class,

957
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:07,378
into a permanent
second-class status.

00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:15,817

fears, and anxieties

960
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,393
have driven the birth
of this system

961
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:25,765
and sustained the idea
that some people are a problem

962
00:48:25,836 --> 00:48:28,896
to be dealt with harshly.

eager to disavow
its racial past,

969
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,800

while in the White House.

971
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:02,631
But during his second term,

972
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:06,802
an all too familiar story
moved him to break his silence

973
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:09,141

00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,162
I said that this

Uh...

981
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,666
Another way

Trayvon Martin
could have been me, uh...

983
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:36,134

This is something that all

Is already suspected to be
a criminal of some son,

990
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,853
and the society around
is empowered

991
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,722
to do something
about that.

992
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:00,029
How you doing, bro?

993
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,622
The big question is

994
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,690
can the nation
be something else?

995
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,498
And that's a question
we all have to ask together.

STEVENS: I knew that
when I returned home,

997
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,205
I had to do
something significant,

998
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,609
I had to do something
that was major,

999
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,380
and I had to contribute
to my society in a huge way.

1000
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,388
I came up with this idea
of starting a foundation

1001
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:29,152
where we would actually
reach out

1002
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,888
to children who lost
their mothers and fathers

1003
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,224

1005

I'm gonna ask that each one of
you guys get up and scream out,

1006
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,066
"I am somebody!"

1007
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,076
We connect them
with a positive role model.

1008
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,738
And we transport them up
to these correctional facilities

1009
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,078
so that they can
reestablish the bond

1010
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,345
with their parents.

1011
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,582
How long your dad

Like...2 years ago.

1016
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,422
It's a crying shame
that, you know,

1017
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,434
mass incarceration
had taken over the community

1018
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:13,867
the way it did, you know.

1019
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:17,100

00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:21,610
Hopefully some of these parents
can return home

they sang our songs,

1044
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,814
since before its inception...

1045
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,194
Never losing sight
of the dream

1046
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:49,858
that one day the United States
would finally achieve

1047
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,367
that more perfect Union.

1048
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,867
Looking back
on the last 500 years

1049
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:05,881
reminds us that when
the weakest members of society

1050
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:08,941
take history
into their own hands,

1051
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:13,012
they can change
the world.

1052
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,090
The journey from the slave ship
to the White House,

1053
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,891
from bondage
to full equality

1054
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,398
has been long
and arduous,

1055
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:27,766
replete with despair
but full of joy as well.

1056
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:31,568
It's a journey
still in progress,

1057
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:36,044
one that we are
continuing together.

1058
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:43,748
ANNOUNCER: Funding for
"The African Americans:

1059
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,448
Many Rivers to Cross,"
was made possible by...

1060
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:51,256
"Senegal, Africa,
The Door of No Return."

1061
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:53,660
From these shores,
millions of Africans

1062
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,096
went across oceans
and continents,

1063
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:59,431
battlefields,
racial barriers,

1064
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,665
and constitutional divides.

1065
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,173
Bank of America
is proud to sponsor

1066
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,177
"Many Rivers to Cross,"
an epic journey

1067
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,510
through 500 years
of African American history.

1068
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,015
We believe connecting
to our past

1069
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,552
helps us all create
a better future.

1070
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,612
Yeah, they have it-
"Wifi, settings."

1071
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:21,452
May I, Mr. Jones?
Please.

1072
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,287
Some connections
are generational...

1073
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,520
others just a few minutes.

1074
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,529
Either way,
our signal is strong

1075
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,996
and deeply rooted
in the community.

1076
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:31,533
The simple joy
of staying in touch.

our American story.

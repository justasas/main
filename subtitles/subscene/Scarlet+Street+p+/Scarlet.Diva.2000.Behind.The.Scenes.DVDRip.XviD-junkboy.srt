1
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,275
Silence!

2
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,548
Silence please.

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,749
Roll camera!

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,389
59, 1, first.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,355
Mauro!

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,393
Filming with a digital camera

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,070
was new to me

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,432
and as with all new experiences,
especially ultra-technological ones,

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,868
it's been fascinating.

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,873
I thought that using this digital
betacam camera,

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,110
which resembles a 16mm
in size and weight,

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,957
would be like asking electronics

13
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,596
for something
that it could never achieve.

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,549
But after we did the first tests

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,234
I started to change my mind
and I was very surprised

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,476
by its quality
and especially its fidelity

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,956
in sharpness and in blacks.

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,232
For me as a producer,

19
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,878
it was a fundamental factor
because, understandably,

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,789
it slashed production costs

21
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,432
I didn't have to buy negative stock
which, as you might know,

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,996
is extremely expensive, I mean...

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,555
it costs enormous amounts of money.

24
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,277
And when doing a feature film

25
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,075
you often have to use
tens of thousands of metres of stock.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,398
In this case we filmed on tape,

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,670
and tape is certainly...

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,474
...infinitely cheaper than stock.

29
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,231
This has made it possible

30
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,274
for a firsts-time director like Asia

31
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,075
to experiment, try out things,
repeat,

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,677
and this was a key factor,

33
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,519
one of the main reasons

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,836
we chose the digital medium.

35
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,919
As I began working
on set with the digital beta camera,

36
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,359
I initially thought
that its weight and size would be...

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,196
would impose
the same limits as a 16mm,

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,551
that is to say the same limits

39
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,035
involved in using film,

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,916
but we found that some things
were actually much easier.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,989
First of all, the monitor control

42
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,758
of photography.

43
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,753
Then, because Asia was director

44
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,353
and actor, she was often in the scene

45
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,473
and she was able to view
everything that she had done

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,355
just as it was made
and as it would come out,

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,552
that is, not just the acting
as in a combo,

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,753
but all the acting and the movements
in their final environment

49
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,518
just as it was lit

50
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,472
and photographed.

51
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,877
If it's good,
let's try and turn it into a detail.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,151
It's important for your career,
do you understand that?

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,591
What career? I want to be a director,
not an actress!

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,750
Roll cameras...
Switch off your mobiles... Ready.

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,915
With digital you can...

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,916
...it's much more intimate

57
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,473
than film.

58
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,992
First of all,
you need a much smaller crew.

59
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,557
I could film some of the scenes
on my own.

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,798
I would position the camera
and just press play and film,

61
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,150
it was just me and another actor.

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,717
This is quite amazing.

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,596
The actors are not intimidated

64
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,199
and they give their best.

65
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,714
My experiences with digital
date back to several years ago,

66
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,790
to when I was filming "Trauma"
in the U.S.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,757
In Los Angeles I had a look at
the first experiences of this kind,

68
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,190
but the equipment was still rough

69
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,393
and transferring the picture
on to film was very problematic.

70
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,513
Quite disappointing.

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,350
In the last few years, though,
this system has made great progress.

72
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,470
The equipment has greatly
expanded and improved,

73
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,959
and especially the possibility of
transferring on to film has improved,

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,357
and now it is possible
without losses.

75
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,396
On the contrary, the richness
of colour and sharpness is amazing.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,074
Thus, I'm very happy that Asia
has used this technology,

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,793
the new digital technology.

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,790
Had it been available
when I made my first film,

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,470
I would have had
greater experiences.

80
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,397
The most obvious advantage

81
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,591
is that you can do

82
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,395
countless takes
or even have filmed rehearsals,

83
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,513
since the film medium is abolished

84
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,950
in terms of costs,

85
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,198
and in terms of time limits

86
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,749
which were 4 to 10 minutes for film,

87
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,793
as opposed to 40 minutes for beta.

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,752
Cinecittà.

89
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,075
Above all,
it will be a great message:

90
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,350
now there are new ways
to make cinema.

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,395
This is wonderful. I'm sure I'll do
this again, it's very exciting.

92
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,354
Don't look into the camera, the first
to look into the camera, you're out.

1
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,258
Two years before
slavery was abolished...

2
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:42,324
and three years prior to the
Proclamation ofthe Republic...

3
00:00:42,402 --> 00:00:45,428
the cafés and bookshops were
the main meeting places...

4
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,338
of the town's intelligentsia
and bohemians such as:

5
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:52,478
Olavo Bilac,
the prince of poets.

6
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:54,914
Marquês de Salles...

7
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:57,575
bohemian and enfant
gâté of the court.

8
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,916
Chiquinha Gonzaga...

9
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:03,513
maestro, skilled pianist
and composer.

10
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:06,153
José do Patrocínio...

11
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:09,218
novelist and
intrepid journalist.

12
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:10,455
Salomão Calif...

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,523
the tailor who dressed
the elegant half of town.

14
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:17,103
Miguel Solera de Lara...

15
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,266
owner of the main bookshop,
Aphrodite's Retreat.

16
00:01:21,975 --> 00:01:25,103
They fought for
the end of slavery...

17
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:28,341
and discussed
republican ideas.

18
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,460
Nanine, I'm going out,
get me my things.

19
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:12,270
Every day,
we spoke of you...

20
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,499
no one else dared
mention your name.

21
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,334
It was she consoled me...

22
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,809
told me we would see
each other again.

23
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:21,146
She was not lying.

24
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,681
Did you visit
beautiful lands?

25
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,649
Will you take me there?

26
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,531
It was nothing.

27
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,938
You see, happiness can't
just invade a heart...

28
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:48,668
which has been desolate
for so long...

29
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,299
not without
being oppressive.

30
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:54,740
Nanine, give me a scarf, a hat.

31
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:57,715
Armand returned,
I want to live.

32
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:02,015
I must live.
I... can't...

33
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,520
You will speak of me,
sometimes, won't you Armand?

34
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:14,089
Give me your hand.

35
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:16,629
It's strange.

36
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,737
What is?

37
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:21,069
I no longer suffer.

38
00:06:23,109 --> 00:06:25,771
I sense a well-being
I never felt before.

39
00:06:26,779 --> 00:06:28,508
But I want to live.

40
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:32,076
I feel well.

41
00:06:37,957 --> 00:06:39,424
She is dead.

42
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:46,425
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!

43
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:28,406
Long live the Emperor!

44
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:30,969
Long live the queen of talent!

45
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,472
What wit!

46
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,240
What riposte!

47
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:42,480
I do hope Your Excellency
enjoyed the play.

48
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:44,989
I merely regret
that our stages...

49
00:07:45,057 --> 00:07:50,723
are not yet up
to European standards.

50
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,659
A stage is just a stage.
The world is a stage.

51
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:56,835
What matters is
what is put on them.

52
00:07:56,903 --> 00:08:01,499
In that case, today we had
the world's greatest,

53
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:03,667
illuminated stage.

54
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,772
I noticed you arrived late.

55
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:12,909
A friend and one
of your greatest admirers...

56
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:15,350
the baroness of Avaré.

57
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,013
-Who? -Her name is...

58
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:21,788
Dalia Maria Luíza
Catarina de Albuquerque.

59
00:08:22,895 --> 00:08:28,731
Our baroness owned
an extremely rare violin...

60
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:31,395
a Stradivarius.

61
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,200
Well, it has been stolen...

62
00:08:34,273 --> 00:08:37,970
and Maria Luiza is
simply outraged.

63
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:41,472
I see. And the police,
what do they say?

64
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:45,639
Well, the violin was
a gift of mine...

65
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:50,883
and although our friendship
is purely platonic...

66
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:56,689
the Empress would hate to see
the matter in the newspapers.

67
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,390
I see your problem,
Your Excellency.

68
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:04,869
Perhaps I can help.

69
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:06,699
Sit down.

70
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,071
You and your marquise,
I mean baroness.

71
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:13,310
It so happens that I am good
friends with Sherlock Holmes...

72
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,609
the world's greatest detective.

73
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,672
Naturally, Your Excellency
has heard of him.

74
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,612
I must confess
my ignorance, Madame.

75
00:09:21,787 --> 00:09:24,085
Holmes is
the first detective...

76
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:27,284
to use a rational
deductive method.

77
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:31,193
Once, Holmes found the missing
jewels of a Russian singer...

78
00:09:31,263 --> 00:09:33,866
just by examining the clothes
she had worn at a banquet...

79
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,299
offered for the emperor.

80
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,835
For me?

81
00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:39,401
No, Majesty.
Napoleon Ill.

82
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:44,833
Well?

83
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,435
By the advanced state
of rigor mortis...

84
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:50,414
death must have occurred in
the early hours of yesterday.

85
00:09:50,616 --> 00:09:54,313
The victim appears to be between
fifteen and twenty years of age.

86
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,388
Saraiva, anyone
can see that.

87
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:00,323
Inspector Mello Pimenta, there is
a strict procedure to be followed.

88
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:02,320
Liver damage,
probably owing...

89
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:06,126
to excessive ingestion
of alcoholic beverages.

90
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,291
If she had not died
from the murderous attack...

91
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,460
she would certainly have been
a candidate for early cirrhosis.

92
00:10:10,536 --> 00:10:11,628
She was a prostitute.

93
00:10:11,704 --> 00:10:13,638
The cause of death is
the dilacerations...

94
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,264
of the larynx
and the pharynx...

95
00:10:15,341 --> 00:10:19,141
in a horizontal cut
initiated from left to right.

96
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:22,442
The aggressor possessed
great physical strength.

97
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:26,542
The ears were also extirpated
with great skill...

98
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:29,611
Saraiva, is there no detail
which may have gone unnoticed...

99
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,179
in the first examination?

100
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,986
Might it have been revenge?

101
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,423
The final touch.
Literally.

102
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:37,826
What's this?

103
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:39,990
It appears to be the
string from a mandolin.

104
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:44,526
Well, at least it's a clue.
A mandolin string.

105
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:47,504
Or a ukulele,
some musical instrument.

106
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:49,932
Could the killer
be a musician?

107
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:52,439
He might be
and he might not.

108
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,503
From the violence
of the crime...

109
00:10:55,581 --> 00:10:59,278
and the place where
I found the string...

110
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:02,252
what I do know is
that he is quite mad.

111
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:32,347
In this bookshop we sell
books, Mr. Bilac...

112
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:35,349
this is not a library.

113
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:37,719
Oh, so? Would you prefer
me to dog-ear the page...

114
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,485
spoiling the volume?

115
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:41,992
What the devil kind
of bookseller are you?

116
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:46,228
Miguel, has Émile Zola's latest
book arrived, ''Germinal''?

117
00:11:46,298 --> 00:11:48,596
And very interesting
it is, too.

118
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,826
It is about the rebellion
of the miners.

119
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:54,270
Not a rebellion,
Miguel, a strike.

120
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,001
Isn't that the same thing?

121
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,236
It is to some. Which is why
the imperial police...

122
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,576
continue to fabricate cases
against us, abolitionists.

123
00:12:02,648 --> 00:12:05,640
That is one of the reasons
I am going to live in London...

124
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:07,913
and open a bookshop
in the East End.

125
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:11,081
This town cannot live without
its Aphrodite's Retreat.

126
00:12:11,223 --> 00:12:14,624
Only my mother's illness
ties me to Brazilian soil.

127
00:12:14,727 --> 00:12:17,252
I don't know how you come by
that Anglophilia of yours.

128
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:20,264
Don't you know that everything
you're thinking of is in Paris?

129
00:12:20,332 --> 00:12:22,926
It is pointless
to speak of Shakespeare...

130
00:12:23,002 --> 00:12:24,936
to the ears of Molière.

131
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:28,098
Don't upset yourself, Miguel.
If you really must go, then go.

132
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:30,108
You've plenty of money.

133
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,641
Did you by any chance
read Múcio Prado today?

134
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:35,338
''Two days ago, I had
the pleasure to dine...

135
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,848
with the extraordinary
Sarah Bernhardt...

136
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,351
a woman of radiant
beauty and talent.

137
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,410
The divine actress
secretly revealed...

138
00:12:42,488 --> 00:12:46,481
to this humble scribe,
that our beloved monarch...

139
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,527
has been troubled lately...''

140
00:12:52,498 --> 00:12:55,365
Following a suggestion by
Sarah Bernhardt herself,

141
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:59,837
our esteemed emperor will
invite an English detective...

142
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:01,964
to come and unravel
the mystery of the theft...

143
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:04,373
of the famous
Stradivarius violin...

144
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,138
belonging to Dalia Maria Luiza
Catarina de Albuquerque.

145
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:13,977
Who can have offered
such a magnificent gift...

146
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,578
to the lovely
baroness of Avaré?''

147
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:20,757
So, Your Majesty has
the nerve to give this woman...

148
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,886
a violin treasured
throughout the world?

149
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:27,399
A jewel in the shape
of a fiddle!

150
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:29,191
That's absurd!

151
00:13:29,335 --> 00:13:33,829
Where can the fellow
have got that from?

152
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:37,736
The same source
you confided in...

153
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,005
from the lips of an actress!

154
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:43,176
As if that were not enough,
you have the audacity...

155
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:47,447
to invite an English detective
to conduct the investigations.

156
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,682
What's got into you?!

157
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:54,192
Are you trying to demoralize
our police force?

158
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,694
I know, I know.

159
00:13:56,762 --> 00:13:59,822
You won't listen to reason.

160
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:00,831
There is nothing
I can do...

161
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,733
but take my leave
and withdraw.

162
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,298
Another piece
of cornmeal cake?

163
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,509
No, just the beverage,
thank you.

164
00:14:12,745 --> 00:14:15,213
Odd reading
for a baroness.

165
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,373
My dear Miguel, one should
know what happens...

166
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,646
when the aristocracy
forgets its people.

167
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:24,385
And as you know,
I am noble by marriage.

168
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,251
My father was a butcher,

169
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,260
as many people are
kind enough to remind me.

170
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:33,389
I prefer to say he was the wealthy
proprietor of a meat store.

171
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:37,157
Ah, finally my Balzac
has arrived.

172
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,330
''Splendeurs et misères
des courtisanes''.

173
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,499
Such a suggestive title,
don't you think, Miguel?

174
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,747
The emperor.

175
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,417
I must leave now,
I'm expected at the bookshop.

176
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,672
Quite so, quite so.

177
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:16,869
Enough now, this is
no time for jokes.

178
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,443
Have you seen
the newspapers?

179
00:15:19,511 --> 00:15:21,911
I found your caricature
most amusing.

180
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,506
The beard was perhaps
a bit too long.

181
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,448
That's not what...

182
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:29,112
Oh, I've already fretted
enough because of that theft.

183
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:31,212
After all, let them
take the rings...

184
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,349
as long as they leave
the fingers.

185
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,125
Anyway, it will be
fun to receive...

186
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,527
an English detective
at the court.

187
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:42,196
A pity you look upon
it all so lightly.

188
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,795
The empress is like
a woman possessed.

189
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,804
Not to mention that
now everyone knows...

190
00:15:46,872 --> 00:15:48,806
the violin was
a gift from me.

191
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,307
How do they know?

192
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:52,469
Who other than I
would have the courage...

193
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:55,104
to do something so crazy?

194
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,478
My friend, I think
you are barking up...

195
00:15:57,549 --> 00:15:59,608
the wrong tree,
as they say.

196
00:15:59,685 --> 00:16:02,654
I could perfectly well
have bought a Stradivarius.

197
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:05,756
My husband left me quite a bit
of money, as you know.

198
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:16,524
The baroness, young
Talented and pretty

199
00:16:16,668 --> 00:16:19,535
A rich widow,

200
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,505
The most coveted
ln the city

201
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,973
What would they say ifthey
knew we were in the same room?

202
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,685
They would probably
refuse to believe it...

203
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,277
avert their eyes like
they do when they stumble...

204
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:39,950
on the blacks and
filthy beggars in town.

205
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:43,620
Ifthe landscape is awful,
then close the window...

206
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,663
isn't that it?

207
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:50,860
Won't you dine with us,
Haroldo?

208
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,029
I cannot. I already
have an engagement.

209
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,388
What is your name?

210
00:17:14,593 --> 00:17:16,220
Glória.

211
00:17:16,295 --> 00:17:18,229
Glória, what a lovely name!

212
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:22,563
To Glória, a beautiful
young Brazilian...

213
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:26,134
who saw me in
Le Passant, in Rio.

214
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:30,433
There you are,
my dear, good luck.

215
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:05,102
Saraiva!

216
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:09,499
Look... no ears,
and another musical string.

217
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,265
Another prostitute?

218
00:19:11,343 --> 00:19:14,335
No, she's from a decent family,
chamber maid at the lmperial Palace.

219
00:19:14,413 --> 00:19:16,040
Her name is
Glória Meireles.

220
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,410
The niece of
that painter, Vitor...

221
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:19,814
-Vitor Meireles.
-That's him.

222
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,852
My god, a friend
of the emperor's.

223
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,388
That's all I needed.

224
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:26,447
What is she holding?

225
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,734
Saraiva.

226
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,859
Allow me.

227
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,776
Sarah Bernhardt.

228
00:19:52,884 --> 00:19:55,216
At your service.

229
00:19:56,088 --> 00:19:58,249
At your service.

230
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:05,293
Police commissioner,
your servant.

231
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:11,460
Please be seated.

232
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,939
Careful not to cut yours!

233
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:18,568
-My what?
-Your ears.

234
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,404
You knew perfectly well
I dislike those jests of yours.

235
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,914
Come on, drink your coffee
while it's hot.

236
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:26,914
This case
is becoming tiresome.

237
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:29,010
I don't even know
where to begin.

238
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,260
Why don't you ask for help
from the English detective...

239
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:38,262
the emperor hired
to unravel the case...

240
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,423
of baroness of Avaré's
valuable violin?

241
00:20:40,499 --> 00:20:42,126
Violin?

242
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:46,499
Might it be a violin string?

243
00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:49,804
This black dress!

244
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:55,541
No, get one of my evening
gowns, a white one.

245
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,510
The skirt is covered
with little roses.

246
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:04,512
That is the one I want.

247
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,290
No! Anyway, that is
the one I want.

248
00:21:09,027 --> 00:21:11,518
And you shall see
how pretty I am!

249
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:14,990
Once again, you shall
be with Frou-Frou.

250
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,969
Poor Frou-Frou.

251
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,067
A great big rat!

252
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:27,374
That's all you ever see
in this theater!

253
00:21:27,446 --> 00:21:29,380
It's a disgrace!

254
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:31,416
And these lights!

255
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:35,920
My morning scenes look like
they were taking place at midnight!

256
00:21:35,987 --> 00:21:39,115
One can't work under
such conditions!

257
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:41,716
And the awful climate!

258
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:44,227
I'll probably catch
yellow fever.

259
00:21:44,663 --> 00:21:47,325
Why on earth did
I come to this country?

260
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,697
It's more like a jungle!

261
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:54,833
And you, what are
you doing here? Who are you?

262
00:21:54,906 --> 00:22:01,209
Chief lnspector Mello Pimenta,
at your service.

263
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,682
Please be seated, Madame.

264
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,183
Oh, what a surprise!

265
00:22:07,252 --> 00:22:09,186
You speak French?

266
00:22:09,388 --> 00:22:10,878
I don't speak French.

267
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,049
He doesn't speak
French, Madame.

268
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:17,394
Sorry to keep you waiting,
we were rehearsing.

269
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,692
She apologizes for the delay.

270
00:22:19,898 --> 00:22:22,992
Madame, do you
recognize this?

271
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:32,132
Yes. A lovely girl who
was outside the theater.

272
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,969
She gave her an autograph
outside the theater...

273
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:36,775
but doesn't know the girl.

274
00:22:36,848 --> 00:22:39,646
She was murdered!
Murdered!

275
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:44,052
Could Madame tell me
whether she was with anyone?

276
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:50,158
He wishes to know whether
you recall anyone with her?

277
00:22:52,063 --> 00:22:54,031
I don't remember.

278
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:55,930
That is, she seemed
to be alone.

279
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:58,235
There may have been
someone with her...

280
00:22:58,303 --> 00:23:00,567
but I don't recall,
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:00,939 --> 00:23:02,372
She cannot remember.

282
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:06,070
Madame is rather late,
will there be anything else?

283
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:10,706
I hope you catch the beast
who killed that poor girl.

284
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:13,410
Good luck with
your investigations...

285
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:17,114
or, as we say in France,
in the theater, merde!

286
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:19,589
She wished you good luck.

287
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:21,523
Merde! to you too, Madame.

288
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:28,459
''Horses shall not gallop
through the streets...

289
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,865
save the Cavalry
in cases of urgency.

290
00:23:30,936 --> 00:23:32,767
Public urinals shall
be constructed...

291
00:23:32,838 --> 00:23:35,830
to prevent citizens carrying out
their necessary functions...

292
00:23:35,907 --> 00:23:37,204
on the sidewalk.

293
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:41,234
And, finally, all cuspidors shall
be removed from the streets.''

294
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:43,577
Do you think
this law will catch on?

295
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,946
Tomorrow I shall fetch the English
detective from the docks.

296
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,882
It appears he's coming
in the company of a doctor.

297
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,818
Is the man sick
or a hypochondriac?

298
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,617
An inseparable friend.

299
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,554
Maybe he's a poof.

300
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:55,457
That's all we need,
an English bugger.

301
00:23:55,527 --> 00:23:56,892
Ours are quite enough!

302
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,897
The other day, one of them
wanted me to make him pants...

303
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:03,594
with the fly at the rear
to facilitate the vice.

304
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:06,930
''l'll pay whatever it costs...
there's money, there's money.''

305
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,312
But seriously, I can't believe
an English detective...

306
00:24:21,386 --> 00:24:23,320
has been brought here
just to look for a fiddle.

307
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:24,650
Not a fiddle.

308
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:27,055
A Stradivarius worth a fortune.

309
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:29,855
Not as much as the lives
of those two young women.

310
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,396
Especially with our police,
who are more concerned...

311
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:34,455
with persecuting those
who fight against slavery...

312
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,966
than saving lives!

313
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,792
Relax, Mr. Bilac,
there is nothing against you.

314
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,929
It is all newspaper
exaggeration.

315
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,633
After all, if our young
men could no longer...

316
00:24:42,707 --> 00:24:45,733
write manifestos what
would become of Brazil?

317
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,801
I just came for a beer.

318
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:49,471
Bring me a Dois Machados.

319
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,379
A curious coincidence.

320
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,850
Do you know we were just now
speaking of the murdered girls?

321
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,285
Quite a worriment,
isn't it, inspector?

322
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:59,846
Two lovely girls, victims of
the same barbarous murderer.

323
00:24:59,925 --> 00:25:02,519
How do you know that
it is the same person?

324
00:25:02,594 --> 00:25:04,323
We've already had
fifteen murders....

325
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:05,556
in the town this year.

326
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,097
I presume so.

327
00:25:07,165 --> 00:25:09,690
They were killed with
the same type of weapon.

328
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:11,235
What weapon?

329
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:14,304
A sharp, cutting object.

330
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:17,034
Look, inspector, any
number of sharp objects...

331
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:19,872
could produce similar results.

332
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,202
Any chef could tell you that.

333
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,511
Chiquinha!
Our detective in skirts!

334
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:29,246
Perhaps Dona Chiquinha would
care to assist with her pow...

335
00:25:29,421 --> 00:25:31,389
This is highly secret.

336
00:25:32,457 --> 00:25:34,823
Found beside them...

337
00:25:35,093 --> 00:25:38,153
entwined around each
of the girl's bodies...

338
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,960
I want to know to which musical
instrument they belonged.

339
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:48,699
Elementary, my dear friend.

340
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,774
They are violin strings.

341
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:53,969
The first and
the last, G and E.

342
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,808
And I'll tell you more:
they can only be found...

343
00:25:57,882 --> 00:25:59,474
in the Viola d'Ouro.

344
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,711
So Mr. Holmes
speaks Portuguese?

345
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:36,244
I suppose so.

346
00:28:00,338 --> 00:28:02,363
And do you still correspond?

347
00:28:02,574 --> 00:28:04,542
No, unfortunately he died...

348
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:06,975
from a concentration of venom
from African scorpions.

349
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,279
Thank you.

350
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,577
Amazing! What is it?

351
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,883
Feijoada, black beans cooked
with several kinds of meat:

352
00:28:50,955 --> 00:28:55,949
pigs' ears and feet,
salted dried meat...

353
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,258
pork sausage and other
varieties. Very good.

354
00:29:00,331 --> 00:29:02,390
I am greatly enjoying
your country.

355
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,828
I am already regretting
my departure for Argentina.

356
00:29:09,674 --> 00:29:11,938
I know I shall miss
enormously this warm public.

357
00:29:39,437 --> 00:29:43,703
Mr. Holmes, try another
rib with red pepper...

358
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:46,767
an infallible recipe
for a light digestion.

359
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,874
Oh, thank you,
but I think I'll have...

360
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:52,178
another slice of fish
with dendê oil.

361
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,946
I shouldn't exaggerate
on the dendê.

362
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,988
And the emperor, don't you
like feijoada and vatapá?

363
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:01,048
Doctor's orders, Mr. Holmes.

364
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:04,117
I cannot believe these delicacies
could possible do any harm.

365
00:30:05,763 --> 00:30:08,391
You're only
having salad, Madame?

366
00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:10,558
I am like the emperor.

367
00:30:10,635 --> 00:30:12,899
My doctor forbade me
to eat many things:

368
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:16,270
red meat, eggs, caviar,
goose liver, cassoulet...

369
00:30:16,341 --> 00:30:18,832
All good things are
bad for one.

370
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:21,011
I quite agree!

371
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:41,430
I do hope your friend
won't mind.

372
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,866
I feel more comfortable
speaking with you alone.

373
00:30:44,936 --> 00:30:47,530
It is a delicate matter,
you understand.

374
00:30:47,605 --> 00:30:50,039
Don't worry about Watson,
Your Excellency.

375
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:52,042
I know you are tired
from your journey.

376
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,807
I shan't take up any more of
your time than is necessary.

377
00:30:57,882 --> 00:31:00,214
I don't even know
where to begin.

378
00:31:00,285 --> 00:31:02,219
Try to begin
at the beginning.

379
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,347
It was nothing.

380
00:31:07,692 --> 00:31:09,387
I'm so sorry.

381
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:16,829
Well then, the last violin
made by Antonio Stradivarius

382
00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:22,133
was an instrument, called, with
good reason, ''The Swan Song''.

383
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:25,903
The instrument's sonority
is almost unbelievable.

384
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,343
The sole detail,
and it is a poignant one...

385
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:33,407
that betrays the tremor
of his aged hands...

386
00:31:33,484 --> 00:31:37,921
is the slightly
unsure intaglio...

387
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:43,723
of the two openings which form
the acoustical system of the top.

388
00:31:44,228 --> 00:31:46,753
I hope I'm not
being tiresome.

389
00:31:46,831 --> 00:31:49,265
No, no, certainly not.
First of all...

390
00:31:49,334 --> 00:31:51,928
I'd like to say how much
I admire His Majesty...

391
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:54,096
for his role as
patron of the arts.

392
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:57,939
I was already familiar with the
musical talent of the Brazilians...

393
00:31:58,009 --> 00:31:59,943
for I had occasion
to attend the premiere...

394
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:02,002
of Il Guarani at
La Scala in Milan.

395
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,273
I was only sixteen,
but I recall it...

396
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,283
as if it were yesterday.

397
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:08,351
It was my first opera.

398
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,080
Fantastic!

399
00:32:10,221 --> 00:32:15,454
For some time my friend,
the baroness of Avaré...

400
00:32:15,526 --> 00:32:19,326
had expressed the desire
to have a Stradivarius.

401
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:22,457
You know how
a woman's whims are.

402
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:24,660
That is why I am
still a bachelor.

403
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,235
All's well that ends well.

404
00:32:27,338 --> 00:32:31,934
Expect for the fact that the
Stradivarius has been stolen.

405
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,410
Yes, well it seems
to me that it is time...

406
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,413
we had a talk
with the baroness.

407
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:39,041
I want to know exactly
how the violin disappeared.

408
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:42,314
My coachman shall take you
to the baroness's residence.

409
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:45,151
I hope my investigations
prove successful.

410
00:32:45,223 --> 00:32:46,986
For now, all that remains
is for me to thank...

411
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,049
Your Majesty for
the magnificent luncheon.

412
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:52,153
The delicacies conferred
on us were magic.

413
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,492
Good afternoon.

414
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,405
Would you care for coffee?

415
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:07,867
It's freshly ground.

416
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:11,373
The sweet potato candies
are from Castellões...

417
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:13,440
one of our best confectioners.

418
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:20,221
I don't know what
I can say to help you.

419
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,156
The baroness would
be astonished...

420
00:33:22,226 --> 00:33:24,194
how important small details...

421
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:27,493
are to those who carry out...
the exercise of deduction.

422
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:30,532
For example, I can state that
the baroness is a widow...

423
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:34,162
that your husband was the owner
of an appreciable fortune...

424
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:36,866
that he died as the result
of a hunting accident...

425
00:33:36,941 --> 00:33:39,034
that he was hunting
beside a river...

426
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:42,610
that he was quite
a bit older than you...

427
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,706
and that when he died
he left you all his goods.

428
00:33:45,783 --> 00:33:49,378
That's amazing! How did
you deduce all that?

429
00:33:49,454 --> 00:33:51,684
I read it in the
Complete Brazilian Peerage...

430
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:53,553
that I found in the hotel.

431
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:56,056
I'd like to know
from exactly where...

432
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:58,288
the instrument disappeared.

433
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:00,328
It wasn't here at the house.

434
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,988
I noticed that one of
the instrument's tuning...

435
00:34:02,066 --> 00:34:03,966
pegs was loose,
making it's tuning difficult.

436
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:07,402
I asked one of my servants to
take it to the Viola d'Ouro shop.

437
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,063
What magnificent coffee!

438
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,074
Baroness, the world
will one day bow down...

439
00:34:11,142 --> 00:34:13,076
to the quality of Brazilian coffee.

440
00:34:13,144 --> 00:34:15,237
May I speak with the servant
Who took the instrument?

441
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,644
Ah yes.

442
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:26,484
This is Mukumbe.
He's my guardian angel.

443
00:34:26,557 --> 00:34:29,185
He was my father's slave
but today is a free man...

444
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,522
manumitted by me.

445
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,620
It is he looks
after everything here.

446
00:34:32,763 --> 00:34:36,563
I don't know why, but I
feel safe in his company.

447
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:42,737
I want to know if by
any chance you noticed...

448
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:45,105
someone following you when
you went to the repair shop?

449
00:34:45,176 --> 00:34:46,404
No, sir.

450
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:49,412
There's not a man living
or a ghost who comes after me...

451
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,141
when I walk through
the streets.

452
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,240
And are you sure the violin
was in the case?

453
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:54,306
Yes, sir.

454
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:57,149
I saw when Madame stored it
before giving it to me.

455
00:34:57,221 --> 00:34:59,951
It was right after we played
a waltz here in the parlor.

456
00:35:00,024 --> 00:35:03,425
Ah, I forgot to say, Mukumbe
is also an exquisite pianist.

457
00:35:03,494 --> 00:35:04,654
He plays the harpsichord
and the organ...

458
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,594
when there is a Mass
here in the chapel.

459
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,308
And what type of music
do you play?

460
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:29,245
It depends.
In church, sacred music.

461
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,912
When I play with Madame,
polkas, waltzes...

462
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:37,422
but what I like most are
maxixe and samba.

463
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:16,110
Hmmmm, excellent!

464
00:38:24,562 --> 00:38:26,587
Good evening, Mr. Isidoro.

465
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,289
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

466
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:29,833
A bottle of milk, please.

467
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,891
For you, anything.

468
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,431
Here you are.

469
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:36,038
Thank you.

470
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:41,836
-Good night.
-Good night.

471
00:40:01,192 --> 00:40:03,251
Help!

472
00:40:03,461 --> 00:40:07,727
Help! Help!

473
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:15,431
There! A man
tried to kill me.

474
00:40:15,506 --> 00:40:17,497
Stay here,
I'll be right back.

475
00:40:55,246 --> 00:40:57,214
This is Sherlock Holmes!

476
00:40:58,048 --> 00:41:00,209
Halt or I'll fire!

477
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:03,767
A mulatto with
generous breasts?

478
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:06,035
That's right, do you know
where I can find her?

479
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,078
I know she's an actress,

480
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:12,676
but I doubt whether you'll
get anywhere with her.

481
00:43:12,816 --> 00:43:15,011
As I already said,
it's about an investigation.

482
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:19,419
We all know how good a real
mulatto can be, right, guv'nor?

483
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:21,085
Good afternoon.

484
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,453
There is not the slightest doubt.

485
00:43:25,529 --> 00:43:28,464
They are very fine
strings, made of gut.

486
00:43:28,532 --> 00:43:30,466
Of excellent origin.

487
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:33,799
May I ask where
you found them?

488
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:35,634
Yes, you can.
But I can't answer.

489
00:43:35,706 --> 00:43:38,072
They are part of a
confidential investigation.

490
00:43:38,175 --> 00:43:41,872
Then they must be connected
to the case of the dead girls.

491
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:44,641
Has anyone been here
of late to buy strings?

492
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:47,081
Only a violinist
called Haroldo...

493
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,642
who is playing in Madame
Sarah Bernhardt's shows.

494
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,051
-Haroldo...
-Yes.

495
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:52,986
How many strings
did he buy?

496
00:43:53,057 --> 00:43:55,651
A full set. Four strings.
A full set.

497
00:43:55,726 --> 00:43:58,388
Four strings...

498
00:44:00,898 --> 00:44:02,866
Inspector Mello
Pimenta, I presume.

499
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,168
That's right.
How do you know who I am?

500
00:44:05,235 --> 00:44:07,169
Simple. I was
at the station house

501
00:44:07,237 --> 00:44:09,228
and they told me
I'd find you here.

502
00:44:09,306 --> 00:44:11,900
Sherlock Holmes, and this
is my friend Dr. Watson.

503
00:44:11,975 --> 00:44:14,500
I didn't know you both
spoke our language.

504
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:16,512
Only l.

505
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,514
Dr. Watson doesn't
understand a word.

506
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:21,518
As you see...

507
00:44:21,585 --> 00:44:23,519
It was good to find you.

508
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:25,987
It was I found you,
my dear Pimenta.

509
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:28,183
Please wait a minute, first
I should have a small chat

510
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:30,351
with Mr. Peruggio.

511
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:34,329
Excuse me...

512
00:44:41,305 --> 00:44:43,205
It was my own
carelessness, Mr. Holmes,

513
00:44:43,273 --> 00:44:45,707
my own carelessness,
I put the instrument here.

514
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:48,677
The shop was broken
into and the violin stolen.

515
00:44:48,746 --> 00:44:50,111
What am I to do?

516
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:53,013
I cannot fathom why you left
such a precious violin

517
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:54,573
within the reach
of the malefactor.

518
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,551
I know they steal
everything here...

519
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,144
food, clothes,
boots, everything...

520
00:44:58,222 --> 00:45:00,281
but I never imagined
that those illiterates...

521
00:45:00,357 --> 00:45:01,949
would steal a violin.

522
00:45:02,025 --> 00:45:04,721
Sincerely, I feel your neglect
has caused great displeasure...

523
00:45:04,795 --> 00:45:07,059
to the baroness and,
of course, to the emperor.

524
00:45:07,131 --> 00:45:09,326
The baroness
and the emperor...

525
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:43,089
Have you any idea of who
might have stolen the violin?

526
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,065
None, sir.

527
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:49,271
Good-bye, Sr. Giacomo.

528
00:46:07,758 --> 00:46:10,283
I have much to tell you.

529
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,021
I shouldn't think
that will be necessary.

530
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:14,188
I already know that as well
as cutting off the ears...

531
00:46:14,264 --> 00:46:16,789
with a dagger, the murderer
places a violin string...

532
00:46:16,867 --> 00:46:19,802
among the pubic hair
of the poor girls...

533
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,735
and then goes playing
through the streets.

534
00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,363
Amazing!

535
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,705
Several people told the police
they heard the sound of someone...

536
00:46:26,777 --> 00:46:28,677
playing a violin
in the streets.

537
00:46:28,745 --> 00:46:31,213
But the newspaper says nothing
of the murderer playing.

538
00:46:31,281 --> 00:46:34,739
I know this because I was
with your murderer last night.

539
00:46:34,818 --> 00:46:36,479
He had his instrument with him.

540
00:46:36,553 --> 00:46:39,818
Presumably he was going to
play it, but I prevented him.

541
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,069
A lovely girl, a mulatto.

542
00:46:58,842 --> 00:47:01,333
Wide hips,
generous breasts.

543
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:03,680
I must find her,
at all costs.

544
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,680
We must find her.

545
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,683
For, if she saw
the murderer's face...

546
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:10,015
she also saw the face
of the violin thief.

547
00:47:10,087 --> 00:47:12,248
But why do you think
he leaves the strings?

548
00:47:12,322 --> 00:47:14,290
-May I examine them?
-Certainly.

549
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:16,417
-No sign of the ears?
-No.

550
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:35,372
Serial killer?

551
00:47:35,712 --> 00:47:38,681
Serial killer.

552
00:47:39,049 --> 00:47:42,041
This expression is just
right for our murderer.

553
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,882
He has already killed two.

554
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:50,385
Don't you see,

555
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:55,058
the violin has four
strings: G, D, A, E.

556
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:58,396
If he's already used two strings,
there are still two left.

557
00:47:58,502 --> 00:48:01,699
Are you trying to tell me he
plans to kill two more girls?

558
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:04,400
Our job is to prevent
these crimes, inspector.

559
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,010
Do you see how delicate
my situation is?

560
00:48:16,086 --> 00:48:18,452
Before long people will think...

561
00:48:18,522 --> 00:48:22,424
the emperor no longer
trusts his chief of police

562
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:25,791
even to solve the mere
robbery of a fiddle.

563
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,022
Stradivarius.

564
00:48:27,097 --> 00:48:28,928
-Stradi-what?
-Stradivarius.

565
00:48:28,999 --> 00:48:30,990
Various or just one,
it's still just a fiddle.

566
00:48:31,068 --> 00:48:34,367
Pimenta, have you told
the English detective...

567
00:48:34,838 --> 00:48:38,797
about our main
suspect, Haroldo?

568
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:42,777
No, since we haven't
gathered all the evidence.

569
00:48:42,846 --> 00:48:46,748
You're authority! The police
don't need evidence.

570
00:48:46,817 --> 00:48:49,377
But we're talking
about a ''serial killer''.

571
00:48:49,486 --> 00:48:51,113
Serial what?

572
00:48:55,993 --> 00:48:57,460
It was the name
Sherlock Holmes gave...

573
00:48:57,527 --> 00:48:59,358
to this criminal
who kills in series.

574
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:03,331
I tell you, Mr. Coelho Bastos,
it's not going to be easy...

575
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,460
to discover the man, because
he kills without motive.

576
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:08,470
And the first thing
we learn in the police...

577
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:10,529
is to find out
the motive of the crime.

578
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:13,474
Let's avoid
embarrassment, Pimenta.

579
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:17,408
Let's arrest this man straight
away, to show the emperor...

580
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:21,076
that our police force doesn't
need an English detective.

581
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:29,153
I'll explain in a moment

582
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:32,389
And tell you my version

583
00:49:32,462 --> 00:49:35,124
That in body and soul

584
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:38,827
I'm an unsexual person

585
00:49:51,948 --> 00:49:53,973
It seems you are
already growing...

586
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,019
accustomed to our Brazil.

587
00:49:56,086 --> 00:49:58,020
It is a fascinating place...

588
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,884
I am enchanted
by the customs.

589
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,516
And the people are
extremely cordial.

590
00:50:02,659 --> 00:50:05,321
However one thing
puzzles me.

591
00:50:05,429 --> 00:50:06,521
The dress.

592
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:08,860
Why do the men all
wear black, as in Europe...

593
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:10,456
in a tropical country?

594
00:50:10,534 --> 00:50:12,331
Mr. Holmes,
you must understand...

595
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,495
that civilization
does have its price.

596
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:36,954
Forrobodó é folguedo de reis

597
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:39,995
Forrobodó de preto forro

598
00:50:40,097 --> 00:50:43,225
Tem um forrobodó na praia

599
00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:45,731
Tem um forrobodó no morro

600
00:50:46,103 --> 00:50:48,731
Forrobodó de D. Pedro é que nem

601
00:50:48,805 --> 00:50:51,399
Forrobodó do seu lacaio

602
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:53,568
Faz rebolar até um poste

603
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:56,578
Não há quem não goste
De um forrobodó

604
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,061
Inspector, I found the violin.

605
00:51:48,131 --> 00:51:50,497
Without strings.
Put that away.

606
00:51:56,673 --> 00:51:58,470
It was Gouveia, wasn't it?

607
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:02,809
My dear fellow, you're in
big trouble. Take him away.

608
00:52:08,518 --> 00:52:11,544
But I don't understand,
Coelho Bastos.

609
00:52:11,621 --> 00:52:15,250
Has the Stradivarius been
found or hasn't it?

610
00:52:15,392 --> 00:52:16,654
Majesty, in order
to answer that...

611
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:19,320
I shall have to use
a technical term.

612
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:23,829
No, the violin has
not yet been found.

613
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,226
But Your Majesty
can rest assured...

614
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:28,328
that we will find
this Stradivarius.

615
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:31,999
The main thing is,
the murderer has been caught...

616
00:52:32,075 --> 00:52:35,511
and everything points to
the fact that the violin thief...

617
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,447
is also the killer serial,
I mean, the kerial siller...

618
00:52:39,516 --> 00:52:41,245
the murderer,
Your Majesty!

619
00:52:43,086 --> 00:52:46,453
I think the railway project
is an excellent idea.

620
00:52:46,523 --> 00:52:50,789
I will make arrangements
for a study to be made.

621
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:54,523
What proj...
But, oh, the project!

622
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:56,589
Of course, Majesty!

623
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:57,963
Good afternoon.

624
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,539
A very important project.

625
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:05,269
Brazil needs railways.

626
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:07,567
Yes, yes, yes!

627
00:53:09,946 --> 00:53:11,709
How many times do
I have to tell you?

628
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:13,373
This is my wife's doing.

629
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:15,714
She's bigger than me,
over 220lbs.

630
00:53:16,419 --> 00:53:18,649
And the ears?

631
00:53:18,888 --> 00:53:21,152
Did you eat the ears?

632
00:53:22,092 --> 00:53:25,118
Ears? What are you
talking about?

633
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:27,196
You've been in trouble
with the police four times now...

634
00:53:27,264 --> 00:53:28,731
I'm in no hurry,

635
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:30,789
you'll confess.

636
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:33,626
I'm not lying.

637
00:53:33,703 --> 00:53:35,671
It was my wife,
I told you...

638
00:53:35,905 --> 00:53:37,770
she is cheating on me
with Sergeant Gouveia,

639
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,638
who lives in my street.

640
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:42,405
Each time I complain,
Marieta beats me

641
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:45,414
and the Sergeant goes
to the police

642
00:53:45,482 --> 00:53:48,007
and makes the charge
that it was I beat her.

643
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:52,011
How did you learn
to speak French?

644
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:54,249
A study grant from His Majesty.

645
00:53:54,324 --> 00:53:56,656
I studied music in Paris!

646
00:53:58,295 --> 00:54:00,923
And why don't you
leave your wife?

647
00:54:01,264 --> 00:54:03,323
It certainly isn't
because of her beauty.

648
00:54:04,134 --> 00:54:06,364
Marieta gets very jealous.

649
00:54:06,436 --> 00:54:08,836
If I left her,
she'd kill me.

650
00:54:40,904 --> 00:54:43,805
...''beard and hair''

651
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,156
I told Mr. Holmes that you were
the best tailor in the city.

652
00:55:00,223 --> 00:55:02,248
Don't disappoint me, Calif.

653
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:04,657
Something for a
special occasion?

654
00:55:04,728 --> 00:55:06,320
I have here the most lovely
flannels...

655
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:08,330
and cashmeres
from your country.

656
00:55:08,398 --> 00:55:09,626
What do you prefer?

657
00:55:09,699 --> 00:55:11,326
Neither one nor the other.

658
00:55:11,401 --> 00:55:13,892
I'd like you to make me
four suits of white linen.

659
00:55:14,003 --> 00:55:15,732
Linen?

660
00:55:16,306 --> 00:55:19,332
But here no one
of quality wears that.

661
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:21,509
It's something
for the hoi-polloi.

662
00:55:21,578 --> 00:55:23,910
Then I shall set the fashion.

663
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,180
So linen it shall be.

664
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:27,682
And white, don't forget.

665
00:55:27,751 --> 00:55:29,719
More appropriate for
the heat of the tropics.

666
00:55:32,622 --> 00:55:36,183
What style, Mr. Holmes?
Have you something in mind?

667
00:55:36,259 --> 00:55:38,659
Nothing very special.

668
00:55:38,728 --> 00:55:41,856
Make the frock coats loose,
with space for the revolver.

669
00:55:42,065 --> 00:55:45,193
I want the pockets deep,
as I always carry...

670
00:55:45,268 --> 00:55:47,259
a pipe and
magnifying glass.

671
00:55:51,608 --> 00:55:54,839
I see that sir is
extremely fortunate.

672
00:55:55,044 --> 00:56:00,038
Don't talk nonsense,
Mr. Salomão, that's my pipe.

673
00:56:02,419 --> 00:56:05,547
Beard and hair!

674
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,823
Yes, I understand, sir.

675
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,882
I want to know whether you
want me to trim your hair...

676
00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:12,018
or a complete cut?

677
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:15,489
Beard and hair!

678
00:56:16,966 --> 00:56:18,433
But is it just to trim?

679
00:56:19,769 --> 00:56:22,397
Beard and hair.

680
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:23,996
A cut.

681
00:56:30,313 --> 00:56:31,575
But sir...

682
00:56:37,987 --> 00:56:40,922
Hello! How good
to see you again.

683
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,322
I feel I owe
you an apology.

684
00:56:43,693 --> 00:56:46,253
Apology? And why should
the young lady apologize?

685
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,190
After all,
you saved my life...

686
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:50,698
and I didn't even
wait to thank you.

687
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:53,861
Under the circumstances,
it's perfectly understandable.

688
00:56:54,304 --> 00:56:55,931
How did you discover
that I work here?

689
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,597
Do you forget
I'm a detective?

690
00:56:57,674 --> 00:57:00,609
Sherlock Holmes
at your service.

691
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:03,779
The English detective? I read
about you in the newspapers.

692
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,838
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Ana Candelária.

693
00:57:07,116 --> 00:57:08,947
The young lady would afford
me immense pleasure...

694
00:57:09,018 --> 00:57:10,952
if she were to accept
an invitation to dine with me...

695
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:13,011
and lnspector
Mello Pimenta.

696
00:57:13,122 --> 00:57:15,181
We are investigating
those horrible crimes...

697
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,486
and your presence is
indispensable...

698
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,391
in solving the case.

699
00:57:19,462 --> 00:57:22,397
Of course. I so much want
you to find the murderer.

700
00:57:22,465 --> 00:57:24,262
Please call me Ana.

701
00:57:26,135 --> 00:57:30,469
Of course, if you will
call me simply Sherlock.

702
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:34,306
I don't understand why you
didn't go to the station-house...

703
00:57:34,377 --> 00:57:36,311
to relate your encounter
with the killer.

704
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:39,314
I was afraid. I didn't know
how I would be received.

705
00:57:39,382 --> 00:57:41,316
You know our profession...

706
00:57:41,384 --> 00:57:43,318
is still confused with
that of prostitutes.

707
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:46,480
Our police treat everyone
with respect and courtesy.

708
00:57:46,556 --> 00:57:48,251
Even prostitutes.

709
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:53,219
Could you give me
a description of the assailant?

710
00:57:53,296 --> 00:57:54,991
Impossible, inspector.

711
00:57:55,064 --> 00:57:57,658
He was wearing a cape,
a mask covered his face

712
00:57:57,734 --> 00:57:59,668
and hat pulled down
over his head.

713
00:57:59,736 --> 00:58:01,328
It was all so fast.

714
00:58:01,404 --> 00:58:03,998
If it hadn't been for Sherlock,
I wouldn't be here.

715
00:58:06,075 --> 00:58:08,009
It seems it could
have been anyone.

716
00:58:08,378 --> 00:58:11,006
Even someone right here,
observing us.

717
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,411
What?

718
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:16,043
You think he might come
to this restaurant?

719
00:58:17,053 --> 00:58:18,020
I don't think anything.

720
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:21,850
For all we know,
it could be you.

721
00:58:22,258 --> 00:58:25,022
Now let's not exaggerate,
Mr. Holmes.

722
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:27,926
And now,
if you'll excuse me...

723
00:58:27,997 --> 00:58:30,522
I have to accompany
the young lady home.

724
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,534
Methods of deduction, my dear
Ana, have their limitations.

725
00:58:53,456 --> 00:58:56,050
How could I have deduced
that such a hot day

726
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,787
would turn into such
an agreeable evening?

727
00:58:59,896 --> 00:59:03,263
-Where shall we go?
-I'd like to see your hotel.

728
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,763
They say the apartments
are stunning!

729
00:59:14,077 --> 00:59:15,237
To the hotel.

730
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:46,203
Good heavens,
how soft it is!

731
00:59:46,643 --> 00:59:50,739
And the room is much
prettier than I thought.

732
00:59:54,984 --> 00:59:59,387
May I offer you something?
Tea, sherry, cocaine?

733
00:59:59,522 --> 01:00:01,615
-Cocaine?
-Yes, an excellent stimulant.

734
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:05,457
I learnt its use with a friend,
Sigmund Freud, a doctor in Vienna.

735
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,558
I'd have thought
I was stimulant enough.

736
01:00:14,504 --> 01:00:15,732
Ana...

737
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:20,473
There's something terrible
that I must confess.

738
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,804
What is it?

739
01:00:24,347 --> 01:00:26,372
I'm...

740
01:00:27,183 --> 01:00:29,014
I'm... a virgin.

741
01:00:31,521 --> 01:00:33,716
Did you take some
vow of chastity?

742
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:36,452
By no means. It's just
that, until I met you...

743
01:00:36,526 --> 01:00:38,494
I never had any interest in sex.

744
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:42,053
My mind was always
focused on criminology.

745
01:00:43,566 --> 01:00:46,592
You mean I'm the first
woman in your life?

746
01:00:56,379 --> 01:00:59,678
Do you understand now why I
was going to resort to cocaine?

747
01:00:59,749 --> 01:01:03,685
My love, those drugs
just dispel desire.

748
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:07,014
You need to relax.

749
01:01:15,565 --> 01:01:18,534
-What's that?
-They're lndian cigarettes,

750
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:20,694
made from cannabis,
an Asiatic plant.

751
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:22,067
What are they good for?

752
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:24,129
The instruction-paper says
they're excellent for snoring,

753
01:01:24,207 --> 01:01:26,198
asthma, sleeplessness,
impotence.

754
01:01:26,275 --> 01:01:28,072
It's a miraculous medicine.

755
01:01:28,144 --> 01:01:30,044
Besides that, it's wonderfully
soothing on the nerves.

756
01:01:40,389 --> 01:01:43,483
Except for the smell,
I don't notice anything.

757
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:45,618
Wait, it always takes
a little time.

758
01:01:52,769 --> 01:01:54,634
That's odd...

759
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:01,174
I'd never noticed how
colorful this room is.

760
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:06,471
Did you notice, Ana,
what lovely birds?

761
01:02:06,616 --> 01:02:09,949
It's as if the animals
were circling around.

762
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,153
Such a whirl!
All the birds flying.

763
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:17,919
-Funny, isn't it?!
-It certainly is.

764
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:28,260
What?

765
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:31,329
Listen, can't you hear?

766
01:02:31,707 --> 01:02:33,265
The insects.

767
01:02:33,843 --> 01:02:35,333
What?

768
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:37,306
The crickets, Holmes.

769
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:39,505
-The crickets?
-The crickets!

770
01:03:06,509 --> 01:03:08,306
What is it?

771
01:03:08,845 --> 01:03:10,870
Do you know what
I feel like doing?

772
01:03:11,013 --> 01:03:14,449
What? I want you to do
everything you want with me.

773
01:03:15,484 --> 01:03:18,351
-Eating something sweet.
-Sweet?

774
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:21,219
I don't know why, but I have
an irresistible urge for sweets.

775
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:55,682
Look, sister.

776
01:03:57,093 --> 01:03:58,685
How lovely!

777
01:07:46,489 --> 01:07:48,081
Tea and toast.

778
01:07:48,157 --> 01:07:50,091
Would Mr. Holmes
like anything else?

779
01:07:59,135 --> 01:08:02,832
Coconut candy.
Bring me a plateful.

780
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,105
I love you, Watson.

781
01:08:09,912 --> 01:08:11,470
Excuse me, Mr. Holmes.

782
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:34,255
Good morning, Mr. Holmes.

783
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:38,316
Dr Watson, this is our coroner,
Professor Saraiva.

784
01:10:48,837 --> 01:10:50,702
Is the girl's
identity known?

785
01:10:50,773 --> 01:10:53,264
Yes. Her name is Albertina
de Lourdes Calixto.

786
01:10:53,342 --> 01:10:54,707
She was from the Wheel.

787
01:10:54,777 --> 01:10:56,301
I understand.
Another prostitute.

788
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:58,005
No, no, Mr. Holmes.

789
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,071
The Wheel is a
charitable institution

790
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:02,242
that takes in abandoned
new-born babies.

791
01:11:02,351 --> 01:11:06,287
The girl was the daughter of a
funeral agent named Josué Calixto...

792
01:11:06,388 --> 01:11:08,754
and worked there
as a volunteer.

793
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:09,949
Who found the body?

794
01:11:10,025 --> 01:11:12,721
One of the Sisters of Charity
of the Holy House of Mercy.

795
01:11:12,795 --> 01:11:13,955
The Wheel is nearby.

796
01:11:14,029 --> 01:11:17,624
I was already there asking
a few questions.

797
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,530
Did you find out
if she had enemies?

798
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:21,262
If anyone followed her?

799
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:24,464
No one knows.
She was much loved.

800
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:27,634
There's a feeling of anger
and sadness on everyone's part.

801
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,077
The clues are the same.

802
01:11:33,015 --> 01:11:37,645
What worries me is that there
is still one string on the violin.

803
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,382
Do you mind if I make
a brief investigation?

804
01:11:40,456 --> 01:11:42,788
By all means.
You would be doing us a favor.

805
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:13,683
Dizzy.

806
01:12:13,756 --> 01:12:16,350
I think yesterday I overdid
some herbs a friend gave me.

807
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:18,154
Indian cigarettes.

808
01:12:18,227 --> 01:12:21,162
I see you tried our pango.

809
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:22,788
Pango?

810
01:12:22,865 --> 01:12:25,390
That's what the Negroes
call cannabis.

811
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,459
There was even a lovely
bed of it behind the kitchen...

812
01:12:28,537 --> 01:12:30,528
at His Majesty's palace
in São Cristóvão.

813
01:12:30,606 --> 01:12:32,631
It would be better for you
to return to the hotel...

814
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:34,801
while I go to the morgue
with Saraiva...

815
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:36,037
to watch the autopsy.

816
01:12:36,111 --> 01:12:38,443
Out of the question, we insist
on watching the necropsy.

817
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:40,243
If you'll permit me,
the best medicine...

818
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:42,909
for this morning-after sensation
is some good cachaça.

819
01:12:45,254 --> 01:12:47,085
I don't think it advisable
to give Mr. Holmes cachaça...

820
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:49,215
at this hour, Saraiva.

821
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:50,781
Nonsense.

822
01:12:50,859 --> 01:12:52,850
I'm going to the morgue.

823
01:13:27,896 --> 01:13:29,261
Look, my friend here
is suggesting...

824
01:13:29,331 --> 01:13:31,765
I put a bit of orange juice
or lime in the drink.

825
01:13:31,834 --> 01:13:34,098
-Have you either of these fruits?
-We have limes.

826
01:13:42,244 --> 01:13:44,109
And ice and sugar, please.

827
01:14:11,807 --> 01:14:14,674
What's that concoction
they're mixin' up?

828
01:14:14,743 --> 01:14:15,903
No idea.

829
01:14:22,284 --> 01:14:24,650
Something invented by
that hick there.

830
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:28,186
-Which, the big one?
-No, the big hick is drinking.

831
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:32,257
The one who made
it is the little hick.

832
01:14:38,534 --> 01:14:40,661
Professor, one thing
I find strange.

833
01:14:40,736 --> 01:14:43,170
I don't know, I have the impression
that the internal organs have been

834
01:14:43,238 --> 01:14:45,001
repositioned in the cavity.

835
01:14:45,073 --> 01:14:47,007
As if the murderer had
first pulled them out...

836
01:14:47,075 --> 01:14:49,043
and then put them
back in place.

837
01:14:49,144 --> 01:14:53,046
Man alive! You're right!

838
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,051
Say it, Mr. Holmes, please!

839
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:37,422
I know it's horrifying,
but I'm certain...

840
01:15:38,093 --> 01:15:41,028
the monster rubbed the liver
on his own face.

841
01:15:41,096 --> 01:15:43,326
At night, the beard
has already started to grow...

842
01:15:43,398 --> 01:15:46,367
and these tiny striations
must have been caused...

843
01:15:46,435 --> 01:15:49,598
by friction with the facial hairs.

844
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,400
Anathema!

845
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,003
Anathema!

846
01:15:54,242 --> 01:15:56,073
Anathema!

847
01:15:57,179 --> 01:15:59,272
My daughter...

848
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,245
my daughter...

849
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:09,248
my little daughter.

850
01:16:11,126 --> 01:16:14,425
Oh Lord, why didn't you
take me instead...

851
01:16:15,364 --> 01:16:17,093
Mr. Calixto...

852
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,565
I'm lnspector Mello Pimenta.

853
01:16:20,669 --> 01:16:25,402
I know this is a very difficult
moment, but even so.

854
01:16:25,474 --> 01:16:27,305
I have to ask you
a few questions.

855
01:16:28,343 --> 01:16:31,608
Do you know if your daughter
had made any new friendships?

856
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:36,379
No, she was totally
dedicated to the orphans.

857
01:16:36,652 --> 01:16:39,780
Did you observe anyone, recently,
lurking near your house?

858
01:16:39,855 --> 01:16:42,619
No. She was dearly loved.

859
01:16:43,992 --> 01:16:48,292
I'd like to have a few moments
alone with my daughter.

860
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:51,093
Who is the pathologist
in charge?

861
01:16:54,469 --> 01:16:56,596
It is l, Saraiva.

862
01:16:56,672 --> 01:16:58,640
If you have finished
your examination...

863
01:16:58,707 --> 01:17:02,302
I would like to use my every
talent as funeral agent...

864
01:17:02,377 --> 01:17:05,972
to restore to the unfortunate girl
the appearance she had in life.

865
01:17:06,048 --> 01:17:07,640
I don't want her to be
seen like this...

866
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:10,075
nor would I like a wake
with a sealed casket.

867
01:17:10,352 --> 01:17:12,650
Of course,
it's the least we can do.

868
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:17,221
My sympathies.

869
01:17:19,494 --> 01:17:21,223
My sympathies.

870
01:17:40,082 --> 01:17:44,451
''Dear chief, by the time
you read these scribbled lines...

871
01:17:44,519 --> 01:17:46,680
I shall be preparing
to execute...

872
01:17:46,755 --> 01:17:50,486
better drawn lines on
the body of another wench.

873
01:17:51,893 --> 01:17:54,987
What do you need
to find me out?

874
01:17:55,063 --> 01:17:57,190
To find the crown jewels?

875
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:01,831
That I sign my full name
on the whores' corpses?''

876
01:18:01,903 --> 01:18:04,929
''l thought the Englishman
would be cleverer than you...

877
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:10,103
at reading my clues,
but it seems he's such an ass...

878
01:18:10,178 --> 01:18:12,078
that he might as well
have ears larger than

879
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:14,240
all those I've cut off,
together.

880
01:18:15,784 --> 01:18:18,275
I hope you're having
as much fun as I am.

881
01:18:18,653 --> 01:18:22,020
Do something soon,
because I'm hungry...

882
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:26,989
and there's still one chord
waiting for the Final Concert.

883
01:18:27,229 --> 01:18:31,063
And speaking of chords...

884
01:18:31,299 --> 01:18:33,199
cordial greetings''.

885
01:18:35,604 --> 01:18:37,697
''Oluparun''.
Doesn't seem very enlightening.

886
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:39,934
The man does nothing but jest.

887
01:18:40,008 --> 01:18:41,839
I think you're wrong, my dear.

888
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:45,175
I think he's insinuating
he attends the court.

889
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,444
And where, Mrs. Know-All, did
you get that idea, might I know?

890
01:18:49,017 --> 01:18:52,384
Well, to start with,
it's an educated person.

891
01:18:52,454 --> 01:18:56,515
True. I also noticed that he took
the trouble to write in a scrawl...

892
01:18:56,591 --> 01:18:59,185
so as not to be identified
by his handwriting.

893
01:18:59,261 --> 01:19:03,595
Then, when he mentions the crown
jewels and a Final Concerto,

894
01:19:03,665 --> 01:19:07,465
he might be indirectly referring
to the charity recital the violinist...

895
01:19:07,536 --> 01:19:10,937
José White will organize this
week, to honor Princess lsabel.

896
01:19:11,006 --> 01:19:13,167
Therefore the murderer must
have access to the court...

897
01:19:13,241 --> 01:19:14,833
and therefore belong to it.

898
01:19:15,277 --> 01:19:16,767
How do you know all that?

899
01:19:16,845 --> 01:19:19,211
By reading Múcio Prado's
society column.

900
01:19:19,281 --> 01:19:20,305
Dear lady,

901
01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:22,749
I must compliment you
on your intelligence...

902
01:19:22,818 --> 01:19:25,286
and capacity for deduction.

903
01:19:26,154 --> 01:19:27,519
Many thanks.

904
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:30,415
And what does
''Oluparun'' mean?

905
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:32,050
I don't know.

906
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:36,757
Well, what interests me is merely...

907
01:19:36,832 --> 01:19:39,767
that my culinary talents
please you.

908
01:19:39,835 --> 01:19:42,804
And what have
you prepared today?

909
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:45,596
Stewed liver à la nature.

910
01:20:45,734 --> 01:20:47,133
Ladies and gentlemen.

911
01:20:47,202 --> 01:20:51,002
I know that tonight we have
with us el señor Sherlock Holmes...

912
01:20:51,072 --> 01:20:55,065
who as everyone knows is
a phenomenal English detective.

913
01:20:55,143 --> 01:20:58,374
But what few know is his
ability as a violinist.

914
01:20:58,446 --> 01:21:01,040
I would like to ask
el señor Holmes to give us

915
01:21:01,116 --> 01:21:04,882
the honor and pleasure
of playing with us.

916
01:23:22,257 --> 01:23:25,021
Bravo! Bravo!

917
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:42,706
Congratulations, my friend!

918
01:23:42,777 --> 01:23:47,043
I didn't know you played the violin,
marquis, in such a brilliant fashion.

919
01:23:47,115 --> 01:23:49,913
Memorable!
I want to kiss the heroes.

920
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:53,748
Impossible to say which
one was better. Bravo!

921
01:23:55,356 --> 01:23:58,883
Mr. Holmes, when you wish to
participate in one of our revues...

922
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:00,894
don't be shy.

923
01:24:00,962 --> 01:24:02,554
The number is worthy
of any theater.

924
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:03,754
Thank you very much!

925
01:24:06,601 --> 01:24:09,161
Seeing a presentation
like tonight...

926
01:24:09,237 --> 01:24:11,967
I lament a bit less the
theft of my Stradivarius.

927
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,167
I would never be able
to play like that.

928
01:24:14,242 --> 01:24:15,402
Thank you.

929
01:24:15,477 --> 01:24:19,413
Extraordinary! A fusion
of Paganini and D'Artagnan!

930
01:24:19,481 --> 01:24:20,413
Thank you.

931
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:25,363
Many think these asymmetrical
gardens are an English invention.

932
01:25:26,738 --> 01:25:27,796
And?

933
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:30,302
But they're not, my love.

934
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:35,176
They were first used in China,
during the reign of Long-Teching...

935
01:25:35,247 --> 01:25:39,274
and were later transported
to Europe by the English.

936
01:25:40,185 --> 01:25:42,153
-You see?
-I see.

937
01:25:50,128 --> 01:25:52,221
I'm dying to give
you a kiss!

938
01:26:04,309 --> 01:26:06,675
Ana, let's go to your house?

939
01:26:06,745 --> 01:26:09,305
I can't. The housekeeper
is very strict.

940
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:13,251
Can we go to my hotel?

941
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,482
It's too far.
Don't stop! Don't stop!

942
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,790
Police!

943
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:32,426
-You're under arrest!
-Calm yourself, constable,

944
01:26:32,504 --> 01:26:34,665
I assure you we were doing
nothing worthy of reproof.

945
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:36,604
We were merely conversing.

946
01:26:36,675 --> 01:26:40,406
You Portuguese are very cheeky.
What were you thinking?

947
01:26:40,478 --> 01:26:43,311
You have to respect the law.
This isn't a colony any more!

948
01:26:43,381 --> 01:26:45,246
You are quite mistaken,
my dear sir.

949
01:26:45,317 --> 01:26:47,285
I am English and my name is
Sherlock Holmes.

950
01:26:47,352 --> 01:26:48,944
I don't care who you are.

951
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:51,284
I caught you red-handed in
an act against public morality...

952
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:52,323
and proper behavior.

953
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:54,517
This is the Public Promenade,
not a brothel!

954
01:26:54,593 --> 01:26:56,788
Off to the clink with you!

955
01:26:56,895 --> 01:26:59,056
The girl has nothing to do
with what happened.

956
01:27:00,932 --> 01:27:04,891
All right, but if necessary
she'll have to testify later?

957
01:27:05,837 --> 01:27:06,929
Shall we go?

958
01:27:14,212 --> 01:27:17,670
What you have done is
very serious, see.

959
01:27:17,749 --> 01:27:20,479
I have already told you that
I have no explanations to offer.

960
01:27:20,552 --> 01:27:23,112
Please be so good as to call
lnspector Mello Pimenta.

961
01:27:23,188 --> 01:27:25,315
I don't know how it is
in your country.

962
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:29,827
But here, the law is
the same for everyone. All!

963
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:32,762
I assure you that you will
regret this imprudent act!

964
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,732
It seems to me the imprudent
act was yours, wasn't it?

965
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,031
Guard, please take
the celebrity to jail.

966
01:27:52,384 --> 01:27:54,352
I demand at least
a separate cell!

967
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:02,656
Release that man!

968
01:28:03,295 --> 01:28:04,956
Release that man!

969
01:28:08,066 --> 01:28:10,227
Are you all right,
Mr. Holmes?

970
01:28:10,302 --> 01:28:13,931
I came as soon as Miss Candelária
informed me of this nonsense.

971
01:28:14,005 --> 01:28:15,973
I was looking for you.

972
01:28:16,074 --> 01:28:18,042
We have an appointment
with Dr. Nina Milet...

973
01:28:18,109 --> 01:28:20,009
a famous criminologist
and pathologist from Bahia...

974
01:28:20,078 --> 01:28:21,943
who can help us.

975
01:28:27,252 --> 01:28:30,813
Well, what does
Oluparun mean?

976
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,789
It's Nagô Yoruba.

977
01:28:32,958 --> 01:28:36,553
It means ''the Destroyer'',
''the Exterminator''.

978
01:28:36,628 --> 01:28:38,721
Then the murderer
is a Negro?

979
01:28:38,797 --> 01:28:41,061
Apparently, besides
struggling for abolition...

980
01:28:41,132 --> 01:28:45,125
we're also going to have
to fight for our innocence.

981
01:28:45,637 --> 01:28:48,435
You well know how hasty
our marquis is.

982
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:52,067
He's probably a mulatto.

983
01:28:52,177 --> 01:28:55,112
How can you make such
a baseless statement?

984
01:28:55,180 --> 01:29:00,584
Mr. Holmes, here in Brazil only
blacks and the poor get arrested.

985
01:29:01,019 --> 01:29:05,217
-And abolitionists, of course.
-And detectives, don't forget.

986
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:07,656
It's purely scientific.

987
01:29:07,959 --> 01:29:13,261
Read the ''Essai sur I'inégalité
des races humaines'', by Gobineau,

988
01:29:13,365 --> 01:29:15,765
an intimate friend
of our emperor.

989
01:29:15,967 --> 01:29:18,333
As Negroes belong
to an inferior race...

990
01:29:18,403 --> 01:29:23,670
the mixture of races leads to
the creation of degenerate beings...

991
01:29:23,742 --> 01:29:25,937
many of whom are born
with propensity...

992
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:30,277
toward mental aberrations
and criminal strains.

993
01:29:30,348 --> 01:29:32,282
Those are the kind of
absurdities which hold back...

994
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:34,011
the abolition movement.

995
01:29:34,085 --> 01:29:36,246
You should be ashamed of
what you just said!

996
01:29:36,321 --> 01:29:39,256
My dear man,
I know whereof I speak.

997
01:29:39,324 --> 01:29:43,090
Studies of phrenology
and craniology do not lie...

998
01:29:43,161 --> 01:29:45,095
I know these theories,
Dr. Nina...

999
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:48,098
but it seems to me a bit hasty
to attribute to Negroes...

1000
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:49,895
the existence of crime.

1001
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,802
If this were so, London and
Paris would be peaceful cities.

1002
01:29:53,872 --> 01:29:55,806
Gentlemen, this is
getting us nowhere.

1003
01:29:55,874 --> 01:29:57,466
One point at a time.

1004
01:29:57,776 --> 01:30:00,472
Why the baroness's
Stradivarius?

1005
01:30:00,545 --> 01:30:02,479
To draw attention
to his power.

1006
01:30:02,547 --> 01:30:06,176
The man leaves clues
on purpose, as a challenge.

1007
01:30:06,684 --> 01:30:10,313
It is likely that he has a subconscious
desire to be caught.

1008
01:30:10,422 --> 01:30:13,516
Congratulations, Miss Gonzaga.
My thought entirely.

1009
01:30:13,858 --> 01:30:15,758
Why does he only kill women?

1010
01:30:16,027 --> 01:30:17,961
Because they're weaker.

1011
01:30:18,063 --> 01:30:19,997
Not all of them.

1012
01:30:20,065 --> 01:30:21,930
Because he hates them.

1013
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,163
Perhaps to him woman is the
symbol of the perverted customs...

1014
01:30:25,236 --> 01:30:27,329
that dominate our times.

1015
01:30:27,405 --> 01:30:29,600
Maybe he's afraid of them.

1016
01:30:29,674 --> 01:30:31,164
It's possible.

1017
01:30:31,242 --> 01:30:33,642
He fears something
they arouse in him.

1018
01:30:33,778 --> 01:30:36,474
Or that they don't
succeed in arousing.

1019
01:30:38,716 --> 01:30:41,514
They call what I do cruel.

1020
01:30:42,187 --> 01:30:43,518
Why?

1021
01:30:44,089 --> 01:30:48,287
It is no different from
what I read in the manual

1022
01:30:50,128 --> 01:30:52,528
about carving up animals.

1023
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:55,391
They only don't call
that ritual cruel...

1024
01:30:55,467 --> 01:30:56,866
because the sacrificed
animals serve as food.

1025
01:30:57,902 --> 01:30:59,529
That's the difference.

1026
01:31:00,905 --> 01:31:04,534
Eat, perhaps I should eat...

1027
01:31:04,943 --> 01:31:07,537
Finally partake ofthe flesh.

1028
01:31:08,613 --> 01:31:10,877
The slaves were right.

1029
01:31:11,015 --> 01:31:14,212
When I was a child,
on the nights of Black Magic...

1030
01:31:14,285 --> 01:31:19,689
at the farm, terrified,
they called me ''Oluparun.''

1031
01:32:39,204 --> 01:32:43,231
Sarah Bernhardt's departure
reminds me that sooner or later...

1032
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:45,173
you too will leave us.

1033
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:49,236
Why don't you come
with me to London?

1034
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:52,249
We have gone far enough.

1035
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:55,312
Stay, dear Enone...

1036
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:59,453
strength fails me,
and I must rest awhile.

1037
01:33:00,491 --> 01:33:03,153
My eyes are dazzled with
this glaring light.

1038
01:33:03,228 --> 01:33:06,322
So long unseen, my trembling
knees refuse support.

1039
01:33:07,332 --> 01:33:08,458
Ah me!

1040
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:20,442
What?

1041
01:33:20,511 --> 01:33:22,479
Officious hand
has tied these knots...

1042
01:33:22,547 --> 01:33:25,880
and gather'd o'er my brow,
these clustering coils?

1043
01:33:25,950 --> 01:33:30,410
How all conspires
to add to my distress!

1044
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,355
What is it? I regret that you cannot
return to the theater tonight.

1045
01:33:44,602 --> 01:33:46,695
Be brief, I have
a young lady waiting.

1046
01:33:46,804 --> 01:33:48,931
My babalorixá, King Obá Shite Ill...

1047
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,372
ordered me to take you
to his ilê.

1048
01:33:51,509 --> 01:33:52,441
Who?

1049
01:33:52,610 --> 01:33:55,704
My great father, the high priest
of candomblé.

1050
01:34:03,921 --> 01:34:08,153
He has important information
about the murder of the girls.

1051
01:34:34,252 --> 01:34:38,746
A poison, brought
to Athens by Medea...

1052
01:34:39,123 --> 01:34:41,591
runs thro' my veins.

1053
01:34:42,794 --> 01:34:45,592
Already in my heart
the venom works...

1054
01:34:45,797 --> 01:34:49,198
infusing there a strange
and fatal chill.

1055
01:34:50,301 --> 01:34:54,738
Already as thro' thickening
mists I see the spouse to whom...

1056
01:34:54,806 --> 01:34:56,933
my presence
is an outrage.

1057
01:34:57,809 --> 01:35:02,109
Death, from mine eyes veiling
the light of heav'n...

1058
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,110
restores its purity
that they defiled.

1059
01:35:33,678 --> 01:35:35,475
You are son of Xangô.

1060
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:40,083
Your orixá, the saint
who protects you.

1061
01:35:44,422 --> 01:35:46,583
Always use this necklace, my son.

1062
01:35:46,958 --> 01:35:48,755
Never forget:

1063
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:52,523
Xangô is your father.
Xangô is your protector.

1064
01:36:01,372 --> 01:36:03,272
I do not understand.

1065
01:36:03,441 --> 01:36:05,341
The orixás summoned
you here...

1066
01:36:05,410 --> 01:36:07,708
but they refuse to manifest
themselves further.

1067
01:36:07,812 --> 01:36:09,609
I am very sorry, my son.

1068
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:15,183
There seems to be some
current blocking the flow.

1069
01:36:35,406 --> 01:36:37,874
Nothing serious,

1070
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:40,206
Dr. Watson has become Exu.

1071
01:36:40,344 --> 01:36:42,278
That's trouble.

1072
01:36:42,413 --> 01:36:44,313
I know that you have
the best intentions...

1073
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:46,043
but I can assure you we.
have no time to pratice...

1074
01:36:46,117 --> 01:36:47,641
any kind of initiation ceremony.

1075
01:36:56,494 --> 01:36:58,394
A ''pomba-gira''?

1076
01:36:59,497 --> 01:37:01,328
It's a female-exu.

1077
01:37:01,399 --> 01:37:03,367
It is a devil-orixá
in female form.

1078
01:37:03,434 --> 01:37:06,028
It usually only comes
into women...

1079
01:37:06,170 --> 01:37:08,661
is that fellow adé?

1080
01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:10,639
-What's that?
-Effeminate...

1081
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:12,770
No, he's English.

1082
01:37:13,478 --> 01:37:16,504
Then the pomba-gira must
have got confused.

1083
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:17,707
What?

1084
01:37:17,782 --> 01:37:23,084
I want oti! I want itaba!

1085
01:37:23,955 --> 01:37:26,082
And you can light th' inãs!

1086
01:37:26,157 --> 01:37:27,556
It's unbelievable!

1087
01:37:27,625 --> 01:37:29,889
Dr. Watson never spoke
any of these languages!

1088
01:37:31,629 --> 01:37:36,225
No, it's the pomba-gira
asking for a cigar and rum.

1089
01:37:44,642 --> 01:37:49,045
So yuh wan' know
whooza zirikila?

1090
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,105
Exactly. We need to know
who the serial killer is.

1091
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:55,710
But yuh already know
th' zirikila.

1092
01:37:59,056 --> 01:38:01,786
Yuh been with 'im.

1093
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,719
He wuz right nex' to yuh.

1094
01:38:07,565 --> 01:38:09,624
Yuh ain't found 'im 'cause...

1095
01:38:09,700 --> 01:38:14,069
yuh've smoked too much
itabojira in yur pipe.

1096
01:38:14,171 --> 01:38:16,401
Yuh hear?

1097
01:38:17,842 --> 01:38:22,006
Yuh not e'en listenin',
English-Portuguese man.

1098
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,150
Yuh better 'an
the color'd girls.

1099
01:38:36,027 --> 01:38:39,827
Th' zirikila is a okorin
with owô odara...

1100
01:38:39,897 --> 01:38:43,799
and he's gonna kufá another
obirin with th' obéte'.

1101
01:38:43,868 --> 01:38:47,827
She says the serial killer
is a man with much money

1102
01:38:47,905 --> 01:38:50,669
and that he is going to kill
another woman with the dagger.

1103
01:38:50,741 --> 01:38:52,038
And why does he do this?

1104
01:38:52,109 --> 01:38:54,839
Why?
'Cause th' zirikila is kolori.

1105
01:38:56,614 --> 01:38:59,174
Well? I want menga!

1106
01:38:59,250 --> 01:39:01,184
I want ejé!

1107
01:39:01,319 --> 01:39:03,844
If I don't get it,
I won't leave!

1108
01:39:06,757 --> 01:39:09,726
Oluparun! Oluparun!

1109
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:12,395
Couldn't I ask the name
of the murderer?

1110
01:39:12,496 --> 01:39:13,724
It would be no good.

1111
01:39:13,831 --> 01:39:17,733
When she asks to leave the body,
it means she'll say nothing further.

1112
01:40:08,486 --> 01:40:11,546
After long years
fantasizing infirmities...

1113
01:40:11,689 --> 01:40:14,817
my mother died
ofsmallpox.

1114
01:40:16,427 --> 01:40:18,691
I feel no pain, norpity.

1115
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:23,362
A sensation ofliberty
invades my soul.

1116
01:40:24,502 --> 01:40:27,027
In spite ofthe ears
and the strings...

1117
01:40:27,138 --> 01:40:29,106
I was not found out.

1118
01:40:29,974 --> 01:40:32,272
And now, nothing
will stop me.

1119
01:40:34,478 --> 01:40:37,276
The time has come to
slaughter the prostitute who...

1120
01:40:37,481 --> 01:40:42,111
with her licentiousness, perverted
the witless emperor of the tropics.

1121
01:40:44,321 --> 01:40:46,289
I think ofangels...

1122
01:40:47,224 --> 01:40:51,183
Not the guardians ofsouls
and bringers of good news...

1123
01:40:52,229 --> 01:40:57,599
but those the Lord sends
to earth to carry out

1124
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,631
His most terrible plans.

1125
01:41:03,240 --> 01:41:05,299
The messengers ofplagues
God's hangmen.

1126
01:41:26,363 --> 01:41:27,387
Mukumbé?

1127
01:41:47,251 --> 01:41:48,809
You?

1128
01:41:50,154 --> 01:41:51,849
I nearly died of fright!

1129
01:41:55,793 --> 01:41:57,693
How dare you come
in like this, at this hour...

1130
01:41:57,762 --> 01:41:59,354
without announcing yourself?

1131
01:42:04,702 --> 01:42:06,636
I heard your mother died.

1132
01:42:08,305 --> 01:42:10,535
I was saddened.

1133
01:42:12,743 --> 01:42:15,644
I know how you loved her.

1134
01:42:21,619 --> 01:42:24,452
So don't you know that visiting
young widows late at night...

1135
01:42:24,522 --> 01:42:26,319
might cause the
wrong impression?

1136
01:42:59,456 --> 01:43:01,424
Mercy!

1137
01:43:03,894 --> 01:43:07,091
No, not the face!

1138
01:43:07,798 --> 01:43:09,698
No!

1139
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:58,076
There can be no more
doubt, my dear Pimenta.

1140
01:43:58,148 --> 01:44:00,139
The murderer had his eye
on the baroness...

1141
01:44:00,217 --> 01:44:02,811
right from the beginning.
The missing D string...

1142
01:44:02,887 --> 01:44:05,651
was for Dalia Maria Luiza
Catarina de Albuquerque.

1143
01:44:05,723 --> 01:44:07,691
I believe the
cycle of crimes...

1144
01:44:07,758 --> 01:44:09,817
of that damned fiddle
are over, at last.

1145
01:44:12,596 --> 01:44:15,497
Excuse me, Mr. Holmes.
Something terrible has happened.

1146
01:44:15,566 --> 01:44:17,796
Your room has been
broken into.

1147
01:44:17,935 --> 01:44:19,664
I am very sorry.

1148
01:44:42,726 --> 01:44:45,695
I regret that your visit
to Brazil has been under...

1149
01:44:45,763 --> 01:44:47,788
such tragic circumstances.

1150
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:51,631
I would dearly like to invite you
to amuse yourself in Petrópolis...

1151
01:44:51,969 --> 01:44:55,871
but my state duties oblige me
to remain at the Palace.

1152
01:45:00,978 --> 01:45:04,539
I have already had two passages
reserved on the ship which sails...

1153
01:45:04,615 --> 01:45:07,709
-for England tomorrow.
-Most generous of Your Majesty.

1154
01:45:07,785 --> 01:45:11,186
We have come to thank you
for your hospitality

1155
01:45:11,255 --> 01:45:13,553
and return the ''Swan Song''...

1156
01:45:13,624 --> 01:45:15,956
finally recovered under
such fatal circumstances.

1157
01:45:16,026 --> 01:45:18,961
Forgive me, Mr. Holmes.
The Swan Song would bring back...

1158
01:45:19,029 --> 01:45:22,021
painful memories
of my gentle friend.

1159
01:45:22,132 --> 01:45:26,193
Merely looking at it
rends my heart.

1160
01:45:26,303 --> 01:45:30,205
I understand, Majesty.
But what should I do?

1161
01:45:30,307 --> 01:45:32,673
After all, it is a Stradivarius.

1162
01:45:32,776 --> 01:45:37,042
You know that, officially,
this violin never existed.

1163
01:45:37,181 --> 01:45:39,376
I would like you to keep it.

1164
01:45:39,917 --> 01:45:43,250
I don't know if I can accept
such a valuable gift.

1165
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,881
Of course you can:
it shall be our secret...

1166
01:45:47,291 --> 01:45:50,419
a remembrance of your time
in the tropics.

1167
01:45:51,295 --> 01:45:55,254
In Rome, when Caesar returned
victorious from battle...

1168
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:59,268
and the multitude acclaimed him
in the parades of Triumph,

1169
01:45:59,336 --> 01:46:02,203
according him the honors
of a divinity...

1170
01:46:02,272 --> 01:46:07,209
he would have a slave beside him
whispering into his ear:

1171
01:46:07,344 --> 01:46:10,336
''Thou art bald,
old and hast a big belly...''

1172
01:46:11,148 --> 01:46:13,776
He wished to be reminded
that he was merely human.

1173
01:46:14,718 --> 01:46:19,178
Humility is the mother
of all virtues.

1174
01:46:19,723 --> 01:46:23,250
Keep the Swan Song as a trophy
of the arduous case...

1175
01:46:23,327 --> 01:46:26,888
that you were unable to solve.

1176
01:46:29,066 --> 01:46:31,227
The only comfort left
to us is that we know...

1177
01:46:31,301 --> 01:46:33,895
all the strings are gone and
the violin has been returned.

1178
01:46:34,338 --> 01:46:36,636
I deduce that this is
the end of the crimes...

1179
01:46:36,707 --> 01:46:38,265
of the mad violinist.

1180
01:46:38,942 --> 01:46:41,877
Another brilliant deduction,
Mr. Holmes!

1181
01:46:41,945 --> 01:46:43,879
I don't know how you do it.

1182
01:46:43,981 --> 01:46:47,212
Elementary,
my dear Pedro.

1183
01:46:58,162 --> 01:47:01,461
I don't understand why you wanted
to see me in this empty theater.

1184
01:47:01,565 --> 01:47:03,328
Forgive me, my love...

1185
01:47:04,701 --> 01:47:06,794
but when I wish to reflect
on something important...

1186
01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:08,462
this is where I come.

1187
01:47:09,206 --> 01:47:13,666
My ideas become clearer...
Iike a church for some.

1188
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:16,208
And what were you thinking?

1189
01:47:18,382 --> 01:47:22,011
About your invitation
to go to London with you.

1190
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:24,478
And?

1191
01:47:26,557 --> 01:47:28,354
Try to understand, darling.

1192
01:47:28,425 --> 01:47:31,223
In London I would be like
a fish out of water.

1193
01:47:31,328 --> 01:47:34,525
How long would our love
endure in a strange land?

1194
01:47:34,798 --> 01:47:38,461
Ana, in London
you'd be my wife...

1195
01:47:38,602 --> 01:47:41,594
you'd be Ana Candelária
Scott Holmes.

1196
01:47:41,672 --> 01:47:42,696
You could work.

1197
01:47:42,773 --> 01:47:45,367
The English theater is
among the best there is.

1198
01:47:45,476 --> 01:47:48,934
I'm just starting.
My career is nothing great.

1199
01:47:49,413 --> 01:47:52,382
I want to find
my own way, Holmes...

1200
01:47:53,417 --> 01:47:55,647
and you have your
crimes to see to.

1201
01:48:04,595 --> 01:48:06,324
I leave tomorrow.

1202
01:48:07,264 --> 01:48:08,731
Will you go to my sailing?

1203
01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,524
No.

1204
01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:15,900
I won't have the strength
to see you at the quay.

1205
01:48:16,607 --> 01:48:18,575
Then this is...

1206
01:48:20,277 --> 01:48:21,710
good-bye?

1207
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:30,486
I don't want you to go away without feeling
you inside me at least once.

1208
01:48:51,742 --> 01:48:53,642
Don't forget,
when you come to London...

1209
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:56,975
there will always be room
at 221 b Baker Street.

1210
01:48:57,080 --> 01:49:01,016
And when you return to Brazil,
I insist you stay at my house.

1211
01:49:01,084 --> 01:49:02,449
Many thanks.

1212
01:49:02,686 --> 01:49:05,780
But although I love this land,
I think the memories I carry...

1213
01:49:05,856 --> 01:49:08,791
with me are too painful
for that to be likely.

1214
01:49:10,494 --> 01:49:11,654
Miguel!

1215
01:49:18,669 --> 01:49:20,569
-Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning.

1216
01:49:20,737 --> 01:49:24,400
Mr. Holmes, does this mean
we'll be traveling together?

1217
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:26,400
What a happy coincidence.

1218
01:49:27,244 --> 01:49:29,144
Going on a trip?

1219
01:49:30,614 --> 01:49:33,412
No, moving.
I plan to live in London.

1220
01:49:33,483 --> 01:49:37,044
So, you take French leave
even when going to England.

1221
01:49:37,154 --> 01:49:39,622
You know very well
this old aspiration of mine...

1222
01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:44,423
to have a little bookshop in London
and lead a peaceful life.

1223
01:49:44,494 --> 01:49:47,156
If you need anything,
I am at your disposal.

1224
01:49:47,231 --> 01:49:49,825
I should like to repay
the generous hospitality...

1225
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:51,925
that I received
in your country.

1226
01:50:05,215 --> 01:50:07,342
They'll never know.

1227
01:50:07,417 --> 01:50:10,409
The simple-minded
detective couldn't read...

1228
01:50:10,487 --> 01:50:13,888
the obvious signs
I left behind.

1229
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:19,193
I recognize that I was playing
with marked cards...

1230
01:50:19,496 --> 01:50:22,431
In England the notes
ofthe musical scale...

1231
01:50:22,499 --> 01:50:24,434
are always designated
by letters:

1232
01:50:24,434 --> 01:50:27,699
G, D, A, E.

1233
01:50:28,272 --> 01:50:31,639
The stupid Englishman
didn't even for a minute...

1234
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:34,700
think about the classification
used by Latin countries...

1235
01:50:35,178 --> 01:50:39,308
Mi for Miguel,
Sol for Solera,

1236
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,809
La for Lara.

1237
01:50:42,619 --> 01:50:45,554
Miguel Solera de Lara.

1238
01:50:46,089 --> 01:50:50,788
And the Re for Aphrodite's
Retreat, my bookshop.

1239
01:50:51,762 --> 01:50:55,892
Aphrodite, a goddess
venerated by whores...

1240
01:50:55,966 --> 01:50:58,935
and protectress
of trollops.

1241
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,898
And the ears?
So obvious. Flaps.

1242
01:51:03,006 --> 01:51:05,531
Flaps of skin, flaps ofa book.
Bookseller.

1243
01:51:05,609 --> 01:51:07,509
The half-witted Englishman
knew the language well...

1244
01:51:07,577 --> 01:51:11,069
but he spoke like a Portuguese for
whom such flaps have a different name.

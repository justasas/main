1
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,343
Holy Father, may I present General Helm,
Commander of the SS in Italy?

2
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,081
Your Holiness,
I've come to pay you my respects...

3
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:11,545
.. and to inform you officially
that the German army is in total control of Rome.

4
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,381
In other words, General,
your forces have occupied our city.

5
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,831
And I'm to convey
the Fuhrer's personal guarantee

6
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:21,995
that Vatican neutrality
will continue to be respected.

7
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:25,254
<i>In return, I would ask Your Holiness to confirm</i>

8
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:29,184
in your communiques, German troops,
particularly the SS detachments,

9
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:31,868
are behaving correctly and with restraint.

10
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:36,374
<i>I shall be happy to report
that you have asked me to confirm that, General.</i>

11
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,769
May I present Colonel Herbert Kappler?

12
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,179
<i>ColoneI Kappler has been personally selected
by Reichsfuhrer Himmler</i>

13
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:51,808
<i>as Head of Police in Rome.</i>

14
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:57,080
<i>I am relieved to hear that the German police
consider it their duty to protect ordinary citizens.</i>

15
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,298
My duty is to maintain order in the streets,
discourage resistance,

16
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:03,792
and to round up escaped prisoners.

17
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,092
<i>Prisoners?
- After Italy's capitulation,</i>

18
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:09,160
many enemy prisoners of war
escaped from prison camps,

19
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,269
which were left unguarded.

20
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,103
And we have reason to believe
that large numbers are heading for Rome.

21
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,225
Some may even be making for the Vatican...
to seek refuge.

22
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:22,580
<i>These, of course, will be arrested
before they reach here, but,</i>

23
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:27,469
in case of unfortunate incidents, I intend,
with your permission,

24
00:05:27,756 --> 00:05:31,592
to have a white line drawn across
the opening of St Peter's Square.

25
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:36,001
<i>The line will show the exact start
of Vatican territory</i>

26
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,781
and, at the same time,
make my men aware of it

27
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,616
<i>and prevent any of them -
any armed German soldiers -</i>

28
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:44,820
<i>from violating it.</i>

29
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,792
I thank you for your consideration, Colonel.

30
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:53,064
And I can only hope that our relations
between the Church and your armed forces

31
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:57,283
will remain as reasonable.
Good day, gentlemen.

32
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:22,016
It's certainly a relief, Holy Father.
They seem prepared to act reasonably.

33
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:29,397
<i>He must have been very sure of my permission.</i>

34
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:32,465
Kappler is the one to watch, of course,

35
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:34,574
<i>with his white line.</i>

36
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:37,641
<i>It is not meant merely to keep his men out,</i>

37
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:41,667
<i>it is a reminder to us of our authority,
of how far we can go.</i>

38
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:25,956
Come on, lad, come on.
Don't be afraid to hit me.

39
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:28,544
Come on.

40
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:34,488
<i>That's it.</i>

41
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,268
<i>Sei bravo! Ancora, ancora!
Bene, bene.</i>

42
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,801
Watch it, now.

43
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:41,391
That's the boy.

44
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,334
E vai, e vai ancora, ancora!
Cosi, cosi! Ancora, dai!

45
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,593
Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

46
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,386
Now, you've a trick of leaning to the left
when you're going to hook.

47
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,687
That's when you leave yourself open.

48
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,275
Try to remember that.

49
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:13,600
<i>But this is the Vatican.
Just let us speak with someone.</i>

50
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:16,860
United States. Americano.

51
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,873
English. Tommy.

52
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,982
B-1 7.

53
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,474
Crashed. Bomber, bomber. Savvy?

54
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:26,062
<i>No. Via, via!</i>

55
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,075
I thought they had to give us shelter.

56
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:31,335
I thought they had to help anyone who asked.
- Bleedin' Eyeties.

57
00:08:31,527 --> 00:08:34,978
There's no need to go running away.
- You speak English?

58
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:37,662
After a fashion. The name's O'Flaherty.

59
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,250
You lads look terrible.

60
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:43,893
<i>Could you do with a bite to eat
and a place to stay? Come on.</i>

61
00:08:46,194 --> 00:08:48,207
Well, I'd advise you to trust me

62
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,274
or you'll end up in Regina Coeli prison
by nightfall.

63
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:57,602
Now, come on. Follow me.
And don't be talking out loud in English.

64
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,351
In you go, now. No-one's going to stop you.

65
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:12,748
Third floor, room at the end of the passage.

66
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:17,349
I've a bit of business to see to
and I'll join you as soon as I can. In you go.

67
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:21,950
Excuse me, but er... what is this place?

68
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:28,566
No speaka da lingo.

69
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,537
It's some kind of hostel, isn't it?

70
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,755
It seems like it, but I'm not sure if it's...

71
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:38,535
Isn't Hugh here?

72
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:41,027
Hugh?
- Hugh O'Flaherty.

73
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:44,095
How silly of me. I can see he isn't.

74
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:48,313
I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

75
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:53,011
I am Francesca. Francesca Lombardo.
And you?

76
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:57,900
I'm Lieutenant Manning, US Air Corps. This is
Corporal Tate, British 6th Armoured Division.

77
00:09:58,187 --> 00:09:59,721
When were you captured?

78
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:03,843
My name is Lieutenant Jack Manning,
my number is 0-7-6-4...

79
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:07,486
If you're only going to repeat your name,
rank and number, Lieutenant,

80
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:10,457
the conversation
is going to be terribly one-sided.

81
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,922
I was picked up in North Africa, miss,
when Tobruk fell.

82
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,702
The lieutenant was shot down a few weeks ago.

83
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:24,550
We were in a camp south of here, and yesterday
the Germans shoved us all into cattle trucks.

84
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,863
We didn't fancy a trip to the Third Reich
so we jumped off and stole some clothes.

85
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:30,493
I see.

86
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,231
And er... what about you? Are you Italian?

87
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,778
My late husband was Italian,
but I am from Malta.

88
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,847
So you could say I was British.

89
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,476
Well, well.

90
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:45,927
And now you just sort of... live here
with Mr O'Flaherty.

91
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:48,611
I don't actually live here...

92
00:10:48,803 --> 00:10:50,720
but I call in quite often.

93
00:10:51,008 --> 00:10:52,733
Where is he now?

94
00:10:53,021 --> 00:10:54,746
In his office, I expect.

95
00:10:54,938 --> 00:10:57,526
He's kept pretty busy.

96
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,607
Blimey.

97
00:11:03,374 --> 00:11:05,674
You've had something to eat, have you? Good.

98
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:08,264
And you've met Mrs Lombardo.

99
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,194
Well now, what are you doing in Rome?

100
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:14,494
The Vatican's neutral, right, sir?

101
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:18,233
That's what the chaps always said.
"If you get stuck, make for the Vatican. "

102
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,218
The trouble was so many people were given
sanctuary during the early days of the war

103
00:11:23,505 --> 00:11:27,435
the Vatican was about to burst at the seams,
so the gates had to be shut.

104
00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:29,257
What about this place?

105
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:33,188
This is a religious hostel on Vatican territory,
safe enough, for the moment.

106
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,447
Excuse me, sir. Are you some kind of bishop?

107
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:40,186
Not nearly that exalted, just a monsignor.

108
00:11:40,377 --> 00:11:42,199
Come in.

109
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:44,883
<i>Ah, Vittorio.</i>

110
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,663
I've got what you wanted.
- That's the boy.

111
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,155
This is my old pal Father Vittorio.

112
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,264
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

113
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:54,852
Ah, that's just the ticket.

114
00:11:55,427 --> 00:11:57,920
Some decent clothes, spruce you up a bit.

115
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:02,522
Lieutenant Manning can wear one of mine.
- Where are you going to put them?

116
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,685
San Sepolcro?
- That's where I put that last lot.

117
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:08,945
<i>I've got the RAF bunch at Via Mazzini.</i>

118
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:12,587
<i>I think we'll try the Ursuline Convent.
- There's no more room at the convent,</i>

119
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,696
but I know where they can go.

120
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,422
Home with me.

121
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,531
Oh, no, you don't.

122
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,544
That's altogether too risky.

123
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,844
I'm not even going to consider it.

124
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,200
You're going to have to...
because I want to help.

125
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:28,980
And this time you're not going to put me off.

126
00:12:31,664 --> 00:12:33,486
So that's the way it is, is it?

127
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,074
It is.

128
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,045
Well, all right.

129
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:41,634
Only for a couple of days.

130
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:44,989
My old tweed golf jacket. That'll do you fine.

131
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:47,385
It's a good thing you're pro-British, Father.

132
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:52,179
Holy Mother, that's the first time
I've ever been accused of that.

133
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,408
Oh, Herbert...

134
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,092
it's... it's unbelievable.

135
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:10,584
Yes. Unbelievable as it is, it's real.

136
00:13:10,872 --> 00:13:12,885
You know something, Minna?

137
00:13:13,172 --> 00:13:15,473
It's mine.

138
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,308
And if you're nice to me, I'll give it to you.
- Pappi, Pappi!

139
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,938
Ah!

140
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:25,060
Careful, Pappi, you'll mess my hair.
- You're your mother's daughter, Liesel.

141
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,690
Whoop-pa.
- Look, look!

142
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:28,703
I'll tell you something, children.

143
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:31,674
When I was little more than a boy
I came here to this city.

144
00:13:31,962 --> 00:13:33,783
I walked everywhere.

145
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:36,851
I saw every street and square.

146
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:39,535
And I fell in love...

147
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,548
.. with Rome.

148
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,178
<i>It's true.</i>

149
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,738
And I always promised myself that one day
I would come back to claim her.

150
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:50,560
What's that, Pappi?

151
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,764
<i>That's the Victor EmmanueI Monument.</i>

152
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:55,449
It looks like a wedding cake, huh?

153
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:57,557
And there, Liesel,

154
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,666
there is the Campidoglio,

155
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,775
where the Temple of Jupiter stood.

156
00:14:02,063 --> 00:14:05,130
All the Roman emperors
used to celebrate their triumphs in war.

157
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:06,856
What's that, Pappi?

158
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,870
<i>St Peter's, at the Vatican.</i>

159
00:14:09,062 --> 00:14:11,075
<i>Where's the Colosseum?</i>

160
00:14:11,362 --> 00:14:13,950
You can't see it from here.
- Can we go there, Pappi?

161
00:14:14,334 --> 00:14:16,155
Yes, I'll take you when I have time.

162
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:19,798
I want to go now.
- I told you, I'll take you there soon.

163
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:22,482
Maybe tomorrow.

164
00:14:22,865 --> 00:14:25,262
We can go anywhere we like.

165
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,096
Rome is ours.

166
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:01,211
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?</i>

167
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,305
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?</i>

168
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,987
<i>Per Piazza Navona, dove si scende?</i>

169
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:30,641
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?
- La terza fermata, signora.</i>

170
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,709
<i>Grazie.
- Prego.</i>

171
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:40,802
Halt.

172
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:47,992
Documenti. Documenti.

173
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,402
<i>Andiamo, svegliati! Andiamo.</i>

174
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,511
<i>E voi?</i>

175
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,099
<i>Documento.</i>

176
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,975
Un altro.

177
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,768
Documenti.

178
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,766
<i>E voi?</i>

179
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,546
Documento.

180
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:17,326
<i>Documento.</i>

181
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:25,187
<i>Ancora.</i>

182
00:16:29,884 --> 00:16:32,281
Documento.

183
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:25,485
This way, please.

184
00:17:41,303 --> 00:17:43,699
Good evening, Monsignor.
- Good evening, Emilia.

185
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:47,917
You remember our friend Simon, don't you?
- Yes, you're the one who's at medical school.

186
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,793
How's it all going?
- It was going well, Monsignor,

187
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:52,902
till the Germans came.

188
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,736
My family is Jewish.
They know what may happen.

189
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,516
This is my elder daughter Guila,

190
00:18:00,762 --> 00:18:05,268
my other daughter Emilia
and our friend Simon Weiss.

191
00:18:05,556 --> 00:18:09,295
These gentlemen are Allied soldiers.
They're going to stay with us for a while.

192
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:13,129
We're very grateful to you, Mrs Lombardo,
but we won't be here long.

193
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,525
We'll rest, then we'll head for the Allied lines.

194
00:18:15,813 --> 00:18:20,414
There's not a chance, lad. The whole German
army's between you and your people in Salerno.

195
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:23,482
<i>In a couple of days I'll have you moved
somewhere more permanent.</i>

196
00:18:23,673 --> 00:18:26,453
We'll see about that.
- Ah.

197
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:29,138
Come on, let's get things ready.

198
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,302
In the meantime, please don't worry.

199
00:18:32,494 --> 00:18:35,369
Things will be a bit crowded, but we'll manage.

200
00:18:35,753 --> 00:18:38,149
I'm sure we will.

201
00:18:40,546 --> 00:18:44,380
It'll be like a rest-cure
after what we've been through, ma'am.

202
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:47,064
Don't get carried away, lads.

203
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,707
This isn't all fun and games, you know.

204
00:18:51,953 --> 00:18:55,693
If there's any trouble, your duty is to get out fast.

205
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,143
Don't tell anyone where you've been hiding,
whatever happens.

206
00:18:59,527 --> 00:19:01,923
If you're captured, you'll only be put in jail.

207
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:06,621
Mrs Lombardo and her daughters will be shot.

208
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,451
What is this?

209
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:27,615
A report on known black market operators, sir.
- Yes. Next.

210
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:30,682
A report on the water and electricity supplies.
- Next.

211
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,366
A list of suspected members
of Resistance groups.

212
00:19:33,654 --> 00:19:36,338
They must be kept under surveillance, Hirsch.

213
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,926
At the first sign of trouble, round them up.

214
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:41,994
What is the latest on those escaped prisoners?

215
00:19:43,144 --> 00:19:46,404
A number have been picked up, sir. Er... 53.

216
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:47,938
Only 53?

217
00:19:48,226 --> 00:19:50,814
Army intelligence
said hundreds were heading for Rome.

218
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:53,402
They cannot be here yet.

219
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:55,798
I don't accept that, Hirsch.

220
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,770
They must be finding places to hide
before we can arrest them.

221
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:02,029
Most of the men picked up, sir,
were heading for the Vatican.

222
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,905
They seemed to think
they would be given shelter there.

223
00:20:05,097 --> 00:20:06,918
I see.
- Up to a few months ago

224
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:11,616
a committee of the Holy Office
was in charge of welfare in the Italian camps.

225
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,109
What is it, this Holy Office?

226
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,889
It's the secret court of the Catholic Church, sir.

227
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,477
It used to be known as the Inquisition.

228
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,353
Indeed.

229
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,050
Now it handles all cases of divorce, heresy,
challenges to the faith, and so on.

230
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:29,159
And this committee?

231
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:31,555
A welfare group set up by the Pope.

232
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,568
But it was headed by...

233
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:35,581
Cardinal Crespini.

234
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,266
But it was largely run
by a man named O'Flaherty.

235
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,567
O'Flaherty. What is he?
- A monsignor, sir.

236
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,538
A high official in the Holy Office.
A sort of religious lawyer.

237
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,743
What else?
- There is no more information.

238
00:20:45,935 --> 00:20:48,907
We could find out more about him,
his associates, people around him.

239
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,591
Yes, well, don't spend too much time on it.

240
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:56,480
Still, it might be useful, at least,
to know where he fits in...

241
00:20:57,726 --> 00:21:00,122
.. this Monsignor O'Flaherty.

242
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:10,476
Coffee, Monsignor?

243
00:21:10,764 --> 00:21:13,735
Well, I wouldn't say no.
That smells like the real article.

244
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:18,049
I believe it is. Mr West seems able
to maintain a regular supply...

245
00:21:18,336 --> 00:21:20,733
though I'm careful not to ask how.

246
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:26,197
Well, now, Sir D'Arcy, let's get back to business.

247
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:29,074
Ah, yes, some 40 Allied escapers, you say?

248
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:32,333
They're mostly British.
A few Americans, some French.

249
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:37,509
I've been hiding them out in various colleges,
monasteries, a couple of private homes.

250
00:21:37,893 --> 00:21:40,385
Well, that's very fine of you. A splendid effort.

251
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:43,261
Well, the point is,
there are going to be a lot more.

252
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:45,178
Are you sure of that?

253
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:48,150
<i>Nothing could be more certain.
It's going to be a major problem.</i>

254
00:21:48,342 --> 00:21:50,834
They've got to be housed, fed and clothed.

255
00:21:51,888 --> 00:21:55,149
I've done all that I can on my own.
Now you'll have to take over.

256
00:21:55,532 --> 00:21:58,408
But I cannot possibly become involved,
Monsignor.

257
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:01,188
I can't take any responsibility for it.

258
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,680
What are you saying to me, man?

259
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:06,364
In the name of God, you're the British minister.

260
00:22:06,652 --> 00:22:11,157
But my dear man, I've been a prisoner here
in the Vatican since the beginning of the war.

261
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,991
This work of yours needs someone
who can move about.

262
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,730
<i>You must understand that,
as Minister to the Holy See,</i>

263
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:24,195
<i>my strictest duty is to do nothing which might
compromise the neutrality of the Vatican state</i>

264
00:22:24,578 --> 00:22:26,400
<i>or of His Holiness the Pope.</i>

265
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:30,138
Though, naturally, this whole business
upsets me dreadfully.

266
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,356
I've had enough.

267
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:39,724
<i>Well, since most of them are British,
I naturally thought I should come here.</i>

268
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,408
If you'll pardon me.

269
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,284
I think I've taken up enough of your time.

270
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,544
Well, it was kind of you to call
and fill me in on the problem,

271
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,037
but, really, my butler - Mr West -

272
00:22:51,324 --> 00:22:54,008
he knows more about what's going on than I do.

273
00:22:58,322 --> 00:23:00,718
"Most kind of you. "

274
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:04,265
"Not my concern. "

275
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,716
"So dreadfully sorry. "

276
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,742
Come in.

277
00:23:12,989 --> 00:23:14,427
<i>Mr West.</i>

278
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,728
Sorry to interrupt you at your work, sir.

279
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,837
You'd better be careful what you say.

280
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:21,521
Yes, I didn't think you looked happy
when you left us, sir.

281
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,547
Mm. Well, it may surprise you to learn
that I was born and raised in Ireland.

282
00:23:25,835 --> 00:23:28,806
<i>During the Troubles
some of my closest friends in college</i>

283
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,161
were shot by the Black and Tans.

284
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:34,845
So I have my own opinion of the English

285
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:37,913
and it's just been beautifully confirmed.

286
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:41,748
Yes, I understand we're not too popular
in certain parts of Ireland, sir.

287
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:44,816
However,
the minister would like you to have this.

288
00:23:55,265 --> 00:23:57,565
- 60,000 lire.
- Sir D'Arcy's sorry, sir.

289
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,386
It's all he can spare at the moment.

290
00:23:59,674 --> 00:24:01,975
It's for food and clothes and stuff
for the escapers.

291
00:24:02,262 --> 00:24:05,139
Oh, he's changed his tune, has he?
- Oh, Lord love you, sir!

292
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:10,124
Which I'm sure he does.
No, he meant what he said.

293
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,287
The Vatican's neutrality
is really most precarious.

294
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:16,930
The minister has to be very careful,
but he's keen to assist you in any way he can,

295
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:19,518
in secret.

296
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:24,982
I might have known.

297
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:26,995
I'll be frank with you.

298
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:29,008
I'm a bit hot-tempered.

299
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,693
Is that a fact, sir?
- One of my little character flaws.

300
00:24:32,077 --> 00:24:33,898
Well...

301
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:36,486
I'll admit that this money is a great relief.

302
00:24:36,774 --> 00:24:40,225
Food and all the rest of it, as you well know,
are getting scarce and expensive.

303
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:43,005
That's where Sir D'Arcy
thought I might come in handy, sir.

304
00:24:43,388 --> 00:24:47,510
I've managed to keep up some contacts.
I've got one or two... friends in the black market.

305
00:24:49,331 --> 00:24:51,728
Have a chair.
- Oh. Thank you very much, sir.

306
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,618
The big problem, if there's to be
as many escapers as you expect,

307
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:59,493
will be finding Italian civilians
willing to hide them.

308
00:24:59,877 --> 00:25:02,082
Provided you intend to carry on with the job, sir.

309
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:05,149
That's another thing.
That's the reason I went to see your boss.

310
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:09,846
If someone doesn't do something quick, all those
people are going to be in mortal danger.

311
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,530
That's right, sir.

312
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:15,310
Well, I've got a few friends I could call on.

313
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:18,569
So have I.
- Meanwhile...

314
00:25:18,857 --> 00:25:22,501
you and I could start organising things.
- In what way, sir?

315
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,006
Mr West...

316
00:25:27,677 --> 00:25:30,649
.. how'd you like to go into
the real estate business?

317
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:46,657
<i>Mi piace molto. Lo prendo. Grazie, signora.</i>

318
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:02,954
Fine. We'll take it. This is the best yet.
- Certainly the most expensive.

319
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,447
And the safest.
They'd never think of looking here.

320
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:08,418
Right. Just round the corner
from Gestapo headquarters.

321
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:14,363
<i>What do you mean you're not going to let us in?</i>

322
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:18,868
<i>Dove... iI ufficizio?</i>

323
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,511
Isn't there someone we can talk to?

324
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,413
Lieutenant Barnett, sir. Royal Tank Corps.

325
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,535
Holy Mother of God, Lieutenant.
This is St Peter's Square not a parade ground.

326
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:37,944
Sorry, sir. I understand you can help us.
- Well, I might.

327
00:26:38,232 --> 00:26:41,013
Now, we're not changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

328
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:43,793
Can you just walk along behind us
like normal people?

329
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:21,179
Try not to get used to it, lads.

330
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:24,055
This is our safest house.
Keep it for emergencies.

331
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:27,601
In a day or two you'll be moved
somewhere a little less elegant.

332
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:32,204
Born in Ireland, sir, of peasant stock.

333
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:36,613
Late entry into the Jesuit college, where
he was known for his anti-British sentiments.

334
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:38,243
Is that so?

335
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:41,885
Appointed Vice-Rector of Propaganda
at the college here in Rome at the age of 28.

336
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,378
Then Vatican Charge d'Affaires in Egypt.

337
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:47,158
He'd been transferred to the diplomatic service?

338
00:27:47,445 --> 00:27:49,842
Yes, sir.
- Well, well.

339
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,101
A resourceful man.

340
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,168
<i>What is this note - "Czechoslovakia 1 936"?</i>

341
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,183
Er... I don't know, sir.

342
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,387
Where did the information come from?

343
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,413
Er... from Beck, sir, of the secret police.
He is outside.

344
00:28:04,701 --> 00:28:07,097
So, bring him in.

345
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,396
<i>Explain this note for me -
"Czechoslovakia 1 936".</i>

346
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:20,710
That is when O'Flaherty was sent there, sir.

347
00:28:20,997 --> 00:28:23,777
The purpose of his mission
has never been discovered.

348
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,037
But in '38, when he returned to Rome
to join the Holy Office,

349
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:29,913
several of the people
whom he was associated with,

350
00:28:30,296 --> 00:28:33,172
and whom the Gestapo wanted to interview,
disappeared.

351
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,185
He helped them to escape?

352
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:38,636
Nothing is certain -
only that he was connected with them.

353
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:41,512
I have put him under surveillance,
as you ordered.

354
00:28:41,895 --> 00:28:45,155
<i>But my men can only follow him
once he crosses the white line.</i>

355
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:47,839
<i>So far they have nothing of interest to report.</i>

356
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,907
But I am interested, Beck. Very interested.

357
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,262
<i>Keep watching him. Anything more
you can learn, I want to know at once.</i>

358
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,851
At your orders, Colonel.

359
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:15,736
Black market prices are rising, Monsignor,
almost every day. It's supply and demand.

360
00:29:16,023 --> 00:29:18,708
We'll need at least 200 lire a week
for each escaper.

361
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:22,829
We'll have to pass the hat round again.
Mine's the largest so we'll leave that to me.

362
00:29:23,213 --> 00:29:25,130
Yes, Reverend Mother?

363
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:27,718
Clothes, Monsignor.
We need boots and shoes.

364
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:31,457
And many of the men are seriously ill.
They need treatment.

365
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:33,853
Father Morosini, your department.

366
00:29:34,141 --> 00:29:36,250
The hospital of Santa Croce is in my parish.

367
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:40,276
The pharmacist promised us
whatever medical supplies he can spare.

368
00:29:40,564 --> 00:29:42,673
First-rate. Anything else?

369
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:44,399
<i>If I could make a suggestion, sir.</i>

370
00:29:44,686 --> 00:29:46,891
We've got a lot of men here, trained men.

371
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:49,000
Are they just going to sit around?

372
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:54,177
No, we can use them for sabotage
or cutting lines of communications

373
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,861
<i>or setting explosives.</i>

374
00:29:57,052 --> 00:29:58,970
An army without guns?

375
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:01,749
Half of them wounded, half starving?

376
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,488
All over Rome,
partisan groups are being formed.

377
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,269
Father, if that's what you want,
then join one of them.

378
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,186
We're not a Resistance group.

379
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,678
<i>We're not here to blow up trains.
- But...</i>

380
00:30:12,966 --> 00:30:15,075
Let me say it once and for all.

381
00:30:15,363 --> 00:30:20,731
As priests it's our duty to do all we can
to help those in danger, the victims of the war.

382
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,606
We're not here to add to the killing.

383
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,866
Forgive me, Monsignor.

384
00:30:27,153 --> 00:30:29,358
Now... back to business.

385
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:34,727
Count Langenthal, you're talking about spare
rooms, well, they're getting scarcer and scarcer,

386
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:37,219
<i>but we managed to dig up a few.
- Good.</i>

387
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:40,287
You have no idea how many escapers
come to me at the Swiss consulate,

388
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,492
but I have to be able to tell them where to go.

389
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:44,601
Well, I've been thinking about that.

390
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:47,093
I want you all to pass the word.

391
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,119
I'll be near the steps of St Peter's,
if anyone needs me,

392
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,378
every afternoon from three till five.

393
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:57,829
That might be a bit dodgy, sir.
You'll be setting yourself up as a target.

394
00:30:58,213 --> 00:30:59,843
Oh, don't worry, my boy.

395
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:02,336
I'll only be a target for the pigeons.

396
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,979
Ah, Rabbi Leoni.

397
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:52,664
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Buona sera.

398
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,252
Relax, gentlemen, relax.

399
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:59,470
You will have noticed how few Jews
have been bothered...

400
00:32:00,908 --> 00:32:04,838
.. and not one single piece of Jewish property
has been damaged...

401
00:32:05,988 --> 00:32:08,385
.. since the SS took control in Rome.

402
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,357
You and your families are quite safe.

403
00:32:11,548 --> 00:32:16,054
Please understand, Colonel,
we have heard stories... rumours.

404
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:19,889
Allied propaganda, I suspect.

405
00:32:20,464 --> 00:32:22,957
But I promise you
that there will be no ill-treatment,

406
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:28,325
no deportations to forced labour
or so-called death camps.

407
00:32:30,625 --> 00:32:33,214
You can take it from me
these camps do not exist.

408
00:32:34,364 --> 00:32:38,486
You and your families will be treated
exactly the same way as any other Italian.

409
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:41,937
Thank you, Colonel.
You have spoken frankly, so must I.

410
00:32:43,184 --> 00:32:45,772
These are words we never expected to hear.

411
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,456
There is one small point, however.

412
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:51,620
I have shown you my good faith.

413
00:32:52,195 --> 00:33:00,534
To show yours, I must ask the Jewish community
to pay an indemnity of one million lire

414
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:04,944
and one hundred pounds in pure gold.

415
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:09,067
<i>This must be delivered to this office
within 36 hours or...</i>

416
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:13,477
I'm afraid I may not be able
to keep my guarantees.

417
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,927
Such an amount of gold is impossible to raise
in such a short time.

418
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,803
<i>ColoneI, I beg you, please give us a little longer.</i>

419
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:22,775
I'm sorry.

420
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,363
36 hours.

421
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:28,143
Starting now.

422
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:33,224
A hundred pounds of gold?

423
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,621
The elders say we have to trust Kappler.

424
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,784
They say that somehow
we must try to raise the full amount.

425
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,756
This Colonel Kappler, he gave his word, did he?

426
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:44,248
Like he told them
there are no extermination camps.

427
00:33:44,632 --> 00:33:49,233
Hold on, Simon. Just hold on.
I've got a lot of friends. They've got friends.

428
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:53,547
<i>You tell Dr Leoni we'll all pitch in
and do what we can. Here.</i>

429
00:33:55,272 --> 00:33:58,819
It doesn't weigh much... but it's a start for you.

430
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,465
Well?

431
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:32,957
Exactly one hundred pounds, sir.

432
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,216
Exactly?
- To the ounce, Colonel.

433
00:35:37,175 --> 00:35:39,571
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:35:43,022 --> 00:35:48,008
Typical! They swore they had no gold, but they
could find it quickly enough when they had to.

435
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:50,213
So it seems.

436
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,951
And now they're going out free.
We should have asked for twice as much.

437
00:35:54,335 --> 00:35:56,731
You're too greedy, Hirsch.

438
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:59,224
I didn't want to make it impossible for them.

439
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:01,428
Sir?
- If we had raided their ghetto,

440
00:36:01,716 --> 00:36:04,592
how long would it have taken us
and how much would we have found?

441
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,276
At best, less than half.

442
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:11,686
Let them do our work for us.

443
00:36:15,137 --> 00:36:16,383
My arm is killing me.

444
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:19,163
You shouldn't have got your tank
shot out from under you.

445
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,272
I thought you said this was a short cut.

446
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:24,148
So it is.
We'll cut through the old ghetto just up ahead.

447
00:36:24,436 --> 00:36:27,887
Could we slow down, just a little?
- Not on your life, Lieutenant.

448
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:33,063
That's Regina Coeli prison, where you'll wind up
if you tangle with one of the German patrols.

449
00:36:33,542 --> 00:36:35,747
Those look like Italians on guard, Father.

450
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:38,816
So they are, poor devils.
Working for the Gestapo now.

451
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:45,813
We're trying to arrange for some
artistic reproductions of Vatican passes.

452
00:36:46,197 --> 00:36:48,018
Good as the real thing.

453
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,086
Even with them
you're going to have to watch your step.

454
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,192
<i>Quick, the both of you, split up.
Remember the address - Via Grazzini 21.</i>

455
00:37:15,051 --> 00:37:16,298
Hierher!

456
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,790
Rein!

457
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,922
You. If you are wise, stay out of it.

458
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:42,564
Why are you doing this?
- We need more people in the work camps.

459
00:37:42,948 --> 00:37:45,536
<i>These have been chosen.
The chosen people.</i>

460
00:37:45,823 --> 00:37:48,220
But their security was guaranteed.

461
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:51,000
They paid for it.

462
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:53,396
Who gave these orders?

463
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:55,986
Colonel Kappler. Take it up with him.

464
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,517
Kappler.

465
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:07,105
Then you make a wish...

466
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,940
.. and you... you throw them in...

467
00:38:11,227 --> 00:38:13,049
Ah.
-.. and your wish will come true.

468
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,075
Mamma says if you throw in a coin,
it means one day you will come back to Rome.

469
00:38:17,266 --> 00:38:19,759
That's a wish that's bound to be granted

470
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:22,444
because we're never going to leave.

471
00:38:25,415 --> 00:38:27,812
Gregorian chant

472
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:08,457
Baroque flute

473
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:16,798
After all the trouble I'd taken to land on a bunker,

474
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:20,249
the Bishop hit his ball a mighty swipe
and it disappeared.

475
00:39:20,632 --> 00:39:23,221
It wasn't on the fairway,
it wasn't in the rough.

476
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:26,576
Where was it?
- It had ricocheted off a tree, hit the fence

477
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:30,889
and bounced into the back of an open truck,
which took it all the way to Genoa.

478
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,532
It was the longest drive in history.

479
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,559
Good evening, Count Langenthal.
- Monsignor.

480
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,914
I am always sure to meet you
at Prince Mateo's parties.

481
00:39:42,106 --> 00:39:46,036
I er... have another six packages
arriving tomorrow. Where can I put them?

482
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,788
<i>Six more? That'd be at 63 Via Rienzi
and the apartment in Piazza Lucca.</i>

483
00:39:52,171 --> 00:39:54,472
Tres bien.

484
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,003
You're socialising with the Swiss consul,
I see, Monsignor.

485
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:06,359
One meets all the best people at your parties,
Prince Mateo.

486
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:09,810
And at least four of them
hiding escaped prisoners.

487
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:13,645
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

488
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,383
I know you are interested in paintings
of the Roman school.

489
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:20,930
I have one you haven't seen before.

490
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,902
I'd appreciate your opinion of it. Please...

491
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,462
You don't deny what I said.

492
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:31,572
You seem very well informed.

493
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:35,598
I have known of your work for some time
and I am ashamed to have done nothing.

494
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:37,611
I believe you're short of money.

495
00:40:37,898 --> 00:40:40,391
That's a slight understatement. We're flat broke.

496
00:40:42,787 --> 00:40:45,375
It is risky to draw out large amounts too often.

497
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:49,401
Here are 300,000 lire.

498
00:40:49,977 --> 00:40:51,798
I'll give you more as soon as I can.

499
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:54,578
I want to give you... some warning.

500
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:56,784
Warning? What about?

501
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:58,797
Yes, I hear things.

502
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:02,152
For instance, the Gestapo is watching you.

503
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:05,794
Are they, now?
Well, that'll keep them out of trouble.

504
00:41:06,082 --> 00:41:08,478
Don't take it so lightly, my friend.

505
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,792
Herbert Kappler
is an extremely dangerous man.

506
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,355
<i>He's seen at all the most fashionable
restaurants, at all the best parties.</i>

507
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:49,039
<i>He is as much a playboy as a priest.</i>

508
00:42:50,669 --> 00:42:53,065
Perhaps.

509
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:57,187
Beck, have you learnt anything more?

510
00:42:58,337 --> 00:43:02,364
We heard he helped organise
a gold collection for the Jews.

511
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,116
<i>Shall we pick him up?</i>

512
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,184
No.

513
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:14,443
We could always sweat a confession out of him,
Colonel.

514
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,935
It's a delicate situation, Beck.

515
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:20,578
It calls for kid gloves,
not your rubber truncheon.

516
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:26,329
Monsignor O'Flaherty
is an important Vatican official...

517
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:31,507
.. a protege of the Pope.
We cannot touch him without proof.

518
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:33,903
People must help him,
does that go for them too?

519
00:43:34,191 --> 00:43:36,012
It does not!

520
00:43:36,204 --> 00:43:38,409
It's time these Italians were taught a lesson.

521
00:43:38,696 --> 00:43:40,613
I want checkpoints at every major street,

522
00:43:40,805 --> 00:43:43,585
and random checks on identity papers
throughout the city

523
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:45,790
and a curfew starting tonight.
- Sir.

524
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:50,008
No-one to go out after dark without permission,
anyone without a permit to be arrested

525
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,555
and anyone who does not stop for questioning
to be shot on sight!

526
00:43:57,869 --> 00:43:59,691
And I want guards...

527
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:02,279
on that white line.

528
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:06,209
Until these people learn who their friends are...

529
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:11,002
.. we'll bring the shutters down on Rome.

530
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:08,531
Ah, Monsignor O'Flaherty.

531
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:16,870
I am told that for the first time in living memory
our work at the Holy Office is nearly up to date.

532
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:20,226
We're getting there, Your Holiness,
slowly but surely.

533
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:22,814
Walk with me, my son.

534
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:28,565
Our work here is never easy, but the war
has made it infinitely more complicated.

535
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:32,783
Every day the white line
becomes more like a prison wall.

536
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:36,331
Every day we become more aware
of all the suffering outside.

537
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:41,220
So many calls for help.
- One does what one can, Holy Father.

538
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,438
Each of my priests
must do as his conscience tells him.

539
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:51,285
I only ask that whatever action is taken,
it does not affect Vatican neutrality.

540
00:46:51,573 --> 00:46:53,586
<i>However,</i>

541
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:56,941
although officially
I am unaware of my priests' activities,

542
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:02,502
it also means that there is very little that I can do
to save any of them... if they are caught.

543
00:47:22,057 --> 00:47:24,262
<i>We are going to need more food.</i>

544
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:26,372
<i>This will mean moving about more.</i>

545
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:29,439
<i>I was wondering
if we could use neutraI passports.</i>

546
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:32,507
Well, we have a few Swiss and Spanish
for emergencies

547
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:36,053
but to get more, even good forgeries,
is almost impossible.

548
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:39,217
I think you'll have to rely on
the Vatican passes for now.

549
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:44,489
Francesca, we were that worried about you.

550
00:47:44,681 --> 00:47:46,502
Sorry I'm late.

551
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:48,515
German patrols stopped me twice.

552
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,337
I thought I'd never get here.

553
00:47:50,624 --> 00:47:52,638
Well, we've not time to recap, I'm afraid.

554
00:47:52,926 --> 00:47:56,568
It's almost time for Kappler's unholy curfew.
Jack will fill you in later.

555
00:47:56,952 --> 00:48:03,950
We're now looking after over 1,700 escapers,
1,726 to be exact.

556
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:05,771
<i>That means tighter security.</i>

557
00:48:06,058 --> 00:48:09,797
From now on, when we contact each other
it'll be through code names.

558
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,618
Go ahead, Harry.

559
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:16,124
Nothing elaborate. The simpler a code name,
the easier it is to remember,

560
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:18,809
<i>and hopefully the harder for the enemy to break.</i>

561
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:22,835
Now, Francesca... you'll be Malta.

562
00:48:23,027 --> 00:48:26,286
The Monsignor... will be Golf.

563
00:48:26,669 --> 00:48:28,970
Father Vittorio will be Vicky;

564
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,133
<i>Mr West-Jeeves;</i>

565
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,393
<i>Count LangenthaI - Edelweiss;</i>

566
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,981
<i>Simon - Doc</i>

567
00:48:38,268 --> 00:48:41,240
<i>and Father Morosini - Boots.</i>

568
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,925
I'll be Tommy
and Lieutenant Manning will be Joe.

569
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,226
And what is my code name?

570
00:48:46,513 --> 00:48:50,539
We thought we'd call you Big Mamma.

571
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:53,607
And now we're going to have to break up
before sunset.

572
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,962
And we have to run and hide in our own city.

573
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:02,330
When my parish people need a priest after dark,
I cannot even go to them.

574
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:06,931
At the moment the Germans
are making the rules, Father,

575
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:10,767
but we can be thinking up one or two ways
to twist them around.

576
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:27,830
<i>.. Zimmers durchsuchen...</i>

577
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:35,595
Albero di vero.

578
00:49:35,883 --> 00:49:37,704
E.
- E vero.

579
00:49:37,896 --> 00:49:41,634
<i>Gli alberi sono veri.</i>

580
00:49:41,826 --> 00:49:44,223
<i>Very good.</i>

581
00:49:49,878 --> 00:49:51,604
It's all right.

582
00:49:51,891 --> 00:49:53,329
I'll get it.
- No, Emilia will go.

583
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:55,822
Yes, Mamma.

584
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:01,382
Emilia, quickly, is your mother there?
Hurry! Hurry!

585
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,354
You have little time.
A German patrol is in the next street.

586
00:50:04,642 --> 00:50:07,517
<i>You'll have to get your men out.
- Clear away the mattresses.</i>

587
00:50:07,901 --> 00:50:09,626
We'll do that. Just collect your things.

588
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:12,981
Take them to St Monica's Convent. Via Luccini.
- Good luck, ma'am.

589
00:50:13,365 --> 00:50:15,474
Emilia, set the table.
- Come on, hurry.

590
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:17,870
Don't be frightened, you're a brave girl.

591
00:50:18,062 --> 00:50:23,047
Help me put the mattresses on the beds, then
clear up everything you see lying around. Hurry!

592
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:25,827
Los! Wo jede wohnen.

593
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:28,032
Schnell! Die Treppe auf!

594
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:30,333
Schnell! Aufmachen!

595
00:50:30,621 --> 00:50:32,346
<i>Schnell.</i>

596
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:34,455
Quickly, quickly.

597
00:50:34,647 --> 00:50:36,468
<i>Aufmachen!</i>

598
00:50:36,756 --> 00:50:39,056
Stand aside. Search the rooms.

599
00:50:47,108 --> 00:50:49,026
<i>My daughters.</i>

600
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:51,614
Anything?
- Nothing, sir.

601
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,037
May I ask what you are looking for?

602
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:01,488
Escaped prisoners and deserters.

603
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,595
Who else lives here?

604
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:13,854
There is only the three of us.

605
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,058
Hm.

606
00:51:23,825 --> 00:51:26,221
Nebenan.

607
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:44,915
At nine you are seeing Father Gatti.

608
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:48,557
9:30 - you review the evidence
in the Di Stefano divorce.

609
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:50,858
They're still battling, are they?

610
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:54,021
Sorry. If I am interrupting...

611
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:57,856
Oh, Vittorio, it's all right. Come on in.
We'll finish that off later.

612
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:01,690
If Father Gatti arrives, ask him to wait, please.
Sit down, Vittorio.

613
00:52:02,936 --> 00:52:04,758
How do you get through it all?

614
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:08,976
I once worked on a farm. It's just the same -
you start early and you stay late.

615
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:12,044
I've been hearing some gossip, Hugh.
It's worrying.

616
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:15,399
And if you wouldn't listen to it,
you wouldn't be worried.

617
00:52:15,687 --> 00:52:20,576
There are people here in the Vatican
who are jealous of your success.

618
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:23,547
Ah, who'd be jealous of a monsignor?

619
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:25,560
You have enemies, Hugh.

620
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:29,107
At the Vatican?
Why would I have enemies here?

621
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:34,859
They say your work for the escaped prisoners
proves you are unorthodox.

622
00:52:35,242 --> 00:52:38,886
Vittorio, I'm not going to start worrying
about politics.

623
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:41,953
You must think about your future.
- Listen to this.

624
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,705
Colonel Herbert Kappler,
born Halberstadt, Germany. Son of a doctor.

625
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:51,731
Personally recruited into the SS
by Reinhard Heydrich.

626
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:57,099
1 938, organised deportation of Austrian Jews
to concentration camps.

627
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:00,838
<i>Transferred to Belgium,
where he put down an insurrection in Brussels</i>

628
00:53:01,221 --> 00:53:02,947
<i>with many reported atrocities.</i>

629
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:08,603
Add to that, in the last six months
he's supervised the deportation of Roman Jews,

630
00:53:08,987 --> 00:53:12,438
he's organised mass round-ups of people
for slave labour

631
00:53:12,725 --> 00:53:16,847
<i>and personally ordered the torture
of hundreds of civilians.</i>

632
00:53:18,956 --> 00:53:22,790
Talk about my career,
my little enemies in the Vatican...

633
00:53:24,803 --> 00:53:27,200
.. here's the real enemy.

634
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,262
Padre!
- What is it, Harry?

635
00:53:51,549 --> 00:53:55,001
There's bad news. Father Morosini
has been arrested at one of the checkpoints.

636
00:53:55,385 --> 00:53:57,206
Arrested? Why?

637
00:53:57,493 --> 00:54:00,753
He was carrying a gun, sir.
He's been taken to Gestapo headquarters.

638
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,779
As well as helping us, he's been working
for the Resistance, as a courier.

639
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:08,517
I should have known he'd do something like that.

640
00:54:09,476 --> 00:54:10,722
Where was he picked up?

641
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,406
Via Alighieri. Mrs Lombardo's sector.

642
00:54:16,282 --> 00:54:18,199
You'd better warn her immediately.

643
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,213
And all of our people in that area.

644
00:54:20,501 --> 00:54:23,377
Start moving as many as you can
to other sectors.

645
00:54:23,664 --> 00:54:25,102
They won't force him to talk.

646
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,594
I mean, they wouldn't torture a priest.

647
00:54:27,882 --> 00:54:30,374
Get moving, Harry. Get moving.

648
00:54:41,494 --> 00:54:43,890
Hold him.

649
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:51,081
Anything?
- Not yet.

650
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,475
Remember me?

651
00:55:01,146 --> 00:55:03,830
Do you know who I am?

652
00:55:05,076 --> 00:55:07,473
I admire your courage, Father.

653
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:14,280
But please understand you possess information
that we must have.

654
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,306
I have...

655
00:55:18,594 --> 00:55:20,894
no information.

656
00:55:21,469 --> 00:55:23,387
For the good of your country...

657
00:55:23,674 --> 00:55:25,400
please...

658
00:55:25,687 --> 00:55:27,988
help me to put an end to the violence.

659
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:30,672
You're a priest.

660
00:55:30,864 --> 00:55:33,164
Surely you want that, too?

661
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,958
I have... no information.

662
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,176
I won't even let you become a martyr, Father.

663
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:45,531
I will have you taken to Regina Coeli

664
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:48,119
to be shot by your own countrymen.

665
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:53,967
<i>Surely you see it's pointless
to go through all this,</i>

666
00:55:55,213 --> 00:55:58,280
when all you have to do
is to give us a few names...

667
00:55:59,527 --> 00:56:01,923
.. and it's over.

668
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:09,305
Very well.

669
00:56:14,098 --> 00:56:16,495
Get on with it.

670
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,108
<i>Monsignor.</i>

671
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,696
Is there any word?

672
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:36,051
Only that Father Morosini refused...

673
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:39,502
.. and still refuses to name anyone.

674
00:56:39,694 --> 00:56:41,899
<i>They've taken him to Regina Coeli prison.</i>

675
00:56:42,186 --> 00:56:45,254
And have you found out
what's to be done with him?

676
00:56:45,637 --> 00:56:47,458
The Holy Father broke his rule,

677
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,197
and appealed to the German High Command
for a pardon.

678
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:54,744
<i>They said they could not interfere.</i>

679
00:56:54,935 --> 00:57:00,209
The decision to execute him or not
lies with the SS Commandant.

680
00:57:00,592 --> 00:57:02,893
Kappler!

681
00:57:10,274 --> 00:57:12,670
My countrymen...

682
00:57:14,108 --> 00:57:16,505
.. I die for love of our country...

683
00:57:18,997 --> 00:57:20,819
<i>.. to which and to God,</i>

684
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:23,408
<i>I dedicate my last thoughts.</i>

685
00:57:25,517 --> 00:57:27,913
Viva Italia.

686
00:57:30,885 --> 00:57:33,281
I forgive you.

687
00:58:02,903 --> 00:58:04,916
Firing party,

688
00:58:05,108 --> 00:58:07,504
<i>present!</i>

689
00:58:08,846 --> 00:58:11,243
<i>Aim!</i>

690
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,666
<i>Fire!</i>

691
00:59:06,077 --> 00:59:07,994
Shoot him!

692
00:59:08,282 --> 00:59:10,583
He is a priest!

693
00:59:23,428 --> 00:59:28,700
Hallelujah

694
01:00:30,341 --> 01:00:31,970
And I got the loveliest blue dress.

695
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:34,559
Sort of off the shoulders.
Not really very expensive.

696
01:00:34,846 --> 01:00:36,380
I shall wear it for New Year's Eve.

697
01:00:36,476 --> 01:00:39,831
<i>And a suit for Franz,
and a pretty little party dress for Liesel.</i>

698
01:00:40,118 --> 01:00:41,940
Mutti, can we open our presents?

699
01:00:42,227 --> 01:00:44,528
Of course. Why not?

700
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:48,747
<i>And then we had lunch at a wonderful restaurant
at Piazza Navona.</i>

701
01:00:49,993 --> 01:00:53,252
Oh, Herbert, it's so beautiful.
We have to eat there together.

702
01:00:53,636 --> 01:00:55,457
Herbert?
- Hm?

703
01:00:55,745 --> 01:00:57,087
You're not listening.

704
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,004
Of course I was.

705
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:01,113
You look very tired.

706
01:01:01,304 --> 01:01:03,126
Is there something wrong?

707
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:06,577
Oh, nothing special.
It's... the usual problems, that's all.

708
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,973
<i>Oh, it's Italian!</i>

709
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:10,986
I wanted a Bavarian doll! I told you!

710
01:01:11,178 --> 01:01:12,808
Look, Pappi!

711
01:01:13,095 --> 01:01:16,164
Oh, Herbert!
Don't they see enough guns everywhere?

712
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,464
That's what he wanted.

713
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:21,052
And it's good for him to get used to them.

714
01:01:22,203 --> 01:01:24,599
This world we live in.

715
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,296
Happy Christmas.

716
01:02:27,389 --> 01:02:29,115
Can you believe it, gentlemen?

717
01:02:29,402 --> 01:02:31,799
<i>One week ago,
the Americans and British landed at Anzio</i>

718
01:02:31,991 --> 01:02:34,388
only 30 miles southwest of Rome,

719
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,647
and not a single German
between them and the city.

720
01:02:38,031 --> 01:02:41,961
And then, for some reason,
some unfathomable reason, they didn't advance.

721
01:02:42,344 --> 01:02:44,837
And the time they wasted digging themselves in,

722
01:02:45,028 --> 01:02:48,288
was enough for us to bring up tanks and artillery.

723
01:02:48,479 --> 01:02:52,601
And now we've closed the gap
with two army corps,

724
01:02:52,985 --> 01:02:57,682
and the mortars,
and dive bombers on them night and day.

725
01:02:58,929 --> 01:03:01,517
<i>The Fuhrer must hear about this.</i>

726
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:06,406
There you have it, gentlemen.

727
01:03:06,694 --> 01:03:08,994
<i>The Anzio beachhead has been contained.</i>

728
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,541
Rome is as safe as ever.

729
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:18,293
Even more so, General. The landing brought out
many partisans in the streets,

730
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,593
so we were able to round them up.

731
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:22,702
Very good.

732
01:03:22,894 --> 01:03:28,359
But I also hear that there are large numbers
of enemy prisoners among them, Colonel.

733
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,139
That suggests that...

734
01:03:31,714 --> 01:03:34,494
.. even in Rome
there were more than we suspected.

735
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:37,178
Many have been rounded up, sir.

736
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:40,437
Soon I shall be in a position to arrest the others.

737
01:03:40,725 --> 01:03:42,450
I'm relieved to hear that.

738
01:03:42,738 --> 01:03:46,860
Reichsfuhrer Himmler himself has asked me
what is being done about them.

739
01:03:47,243 --> 01:03:49,065
I am fairly certain that um...

740
01:03:49,352 --> 01:03:52,229
this organisation
which is helping these prisoners...

741
01:03:53,475 --> 01:03:55,872
.. is being run by one man.

742
01:03:56,447 --> 01:03:57,597
A priest.

743
01:03:57,693 --> 01:03:59,514
Then deal with him. Deal with him quickly.

744
01:03:59,706 --> 01:04:02,773
The Reichsfuhrer doesn't deal in supposition,
he wants results.

745
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:25,110
Well, that's the last department checked.
Come on, let's go home.

746
01:04:25,397 --> 01:04:27,219
Do we have to go right away?

747
01:04:27,506 --> 01:04:30,286
Your mother would kill me
if she knew I'd taken you with me.

748
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,970
We never get a chance to be alone.

749
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:35,271
OK.

750
01:04:35,558 --> 01:04:37,859
We'll take the long way home. Hm?

751
01:04:54,444 --> 01:04:57,128
Ah, thank you, Commander Tore. Thank you.

752
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:03,742
Thank you for looking after our friends.

753
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:10,070
Ah, good evening, Count.
- Monsignor.

754
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:15,726
Are you enjoying the opera, Mrs Lombardo?
- Very much. Thank you, Count Langenthal.

755
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:18,697
It's nice to be reminded
of what life used to be like.

756
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:22,723
Could our friends in Trastevere possibly
entertain a few more visiting monks

757
01:05:22,915 --> 01:05:24,545
if I were to send them round tomorrow?

758
01:05:24,832 --> 01:05:27,133
Yes, I think we could manage that, Monsignor.

759
01:05:28,379 --> 01:05:31,447
Well, shall we be getting back
for another dose of Puccini?

760
01:05:40,554 --> 01:05:42,951
<i>Next.</i>

761
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:47,264
<i>Do you work for the Vatican?</i>

762
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:49,086
Yes, er... Civilian Records Office.

763
01:05:49,373 --> 01:05:51,386
Nationality?
- Irish.

764
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:52,920
Passport, please.

765
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:55,508
Uh, I don't carry it with me.
- Wait over there, please.

766
01:05:55,796 --> 01:05:58,959
I don't understand. This has never been...
- Colonel Kappler's orders.

767
01:05:59,247 --> 01:06:01,836
Vatican passes are no longer valid on their own.

768
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:04,520
Next!

769
01:06:05,479 --> 01:06:07,875
<i>Documenti!</i>

770
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:11,039
<i>Dai, passi.</i>

771
01:06:11,326 --> 01:06:13,627
<i>Avanti!</i>

772
01:06:16,982 --> 01:06:19,378
<i>Documenti!</i>

773
01:06:26,089 --> 01:06:28,486
Was machst du da?

774
01:06:29,828 --> 01:06:32,224
Portalo via.

775
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:38,359
PUCCINl: La Boheme

776
01:07:19,006 --> 01:07:21,402
<i>Bravo!</i>

777
01:07:26,866 --> 01:07:28,688
<i>Bravo!</i>

778
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:31,180
What will they do?
- Nothing till the morning.

779
01:07:31,372 --> 01:07:33,577
They'll check out his name
with the Irish embassy.

780
01:07:33,864 --> 01:07:36,932
It's a false name on the pass! They'll find out!
- Don't take on so, lass.

781
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:40,095
We're going to think of something. Come along.

782
01:07:40,478 --> 01:07:41,820
Do you see something, darling?

783
01:07:42,012 --> 01:07:45,081
Yes. Someone I very much want to meet.

784
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,338
Francesca.
- What is it?

785
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:59,172
It's Kappler.
I've half an idea he wants a word with me.

786
01:07:59,556 --> 01:08:01,664
You and Guila run along now with the Count.

787
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,253
Go straight home, mind. Off you go.

788
01:08:06,074 --> 01:08:07,895
I don't believe we've met.

789
01:08:08,183 --> 01:08:10,389
I'm sure I would have remembered, Colonel.

790
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:14,031
My dear, this is Monsignor O'Flaherty
of the Holy Office. My wife.

791
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:16,524
Monsignor.
- Good evening, Mrs Kappler.

792
01:08:16,715 --> 01:08:20,166
The Holy Office. Is that part of your church?
- We like to think so.

793
01:08:20,454 --> 01:08:23,330
My aide, Captain Hirsch.
- Captain.

794
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:25,726
Well, I'm delighted to meet you at last, Colonel.

795
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:27,739
I've heard so much about you.

796
01:08:28,027 --> 01:08:29,369
And I of you.

797
01:08:29,561 --> 01:08:31,190
Did you enjoy the opera, Monsignor?

798
01:08:31,478 --> 01:08:33,587
Enormously. Puccini's my favourite.

799
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:35,984
Ah! So, we have something in common.

800
01:08:36,272 --> 01:08:39,339
Perhaps we can discuss it one day,
among other things.

801
01:08:39,627 --> 01:08:41,736
That would be delightful.

802
01:08:41,927 --> 01:08:44,899
I hope you will be my guest, in fact,
in the near future.

803
01:08:45,282 --> 01:08:48,254
That would depend on how long
you're going to stay in Rome.

804
01:08:49,404 --> 01:08:51,801
I intend to be here for a very long time.

805
01:08:53,526 --> 01:08:55,444
O'Flaherty? That's Irish, isn't it?

806
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,936
Indeed it is, ma'am. As Irish as McGinty's goat.

807
01:08:58,224 --> 01:09:00,524
From the land of saints and scholars
and leprechauns.

808
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:04,551
It's a very primitive country, I believe.

809
01:09:04,743 --> 01:09:07,619
I doubt, Hirsch,
if the Monsignor would agree with you.

810
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,728
He will tell us it is a modern democracy now.

811
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:15,767
And that's a fact, Colonel. With an elected prime
minister, parliament, religious freedom as well.

812
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:19,505
It's a system I'd recommend to you.

813
01:09:21,998 --> 01:09:24,586
Well, I mustn't hold you up any longer.

814
01:09:24,873 --> 01:09:27,367
It's a rare pleasure.
We shall meet again, I promise.

815
01:09:28,996 --> 01:09:30,434
In the case we don't,

816
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:33,502
I wonder if I might have a little memento
of this evening?

817
01:09:33,885 --> 01:09:38,007
Would it be asking too much
for you to sign my programme?

818
01:09:38,391 --> 01:09:40,020
Oh!

819
01:09:40,212 --> 01:09:42,513
Why not?

820
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:49,606
Ah, you're kindness itself.

821
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:54,208
It's been a great privilege to have met with you,
Mrs Kappler, Captain Hirsch.

822
01:09:57,755 --> 01:09:59,577
Very charming man, isn't he?

823
01:09:59,768 --> 01:10:01,110
Indeed.

824
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:04,274
Too bad we didn't meet the lady he was with.
She was lovely.

825
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:06,862
Yes, I would have liked to have met her, too.

826
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,600
Find her.
- Ja.

827
01:10:13,093 --> 01:10:15,585
Malta, Tommy, Golf,

828
01:10:15,873 --> 01:10:17,023
Vicky.

829
01:10:17,215 --> 01:10:19,996
<i>Where did you get this?
- From a man we picked up last night.</i>

830
01:10:20,379 --> 01:10:23,159
What did they do with him?
- He was taken to the Regina Coeli

831
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,268
until his identity could be checked.

832
01:10:25,556 --> 01:10:27,856
I've asked Beck to bring him here.

833
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:32,649
We are the idiots, Hirsch!

834
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,279
Sir?

835
01:10:34,566 --> 01:10:39,072
With all our technology, all our experts,
we expect something complicated.

836
01:10:39,455 --> 01:10:43,098
But suppose this is something
really very simple?

837
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:46,166
So simple, in fact,

838
01:10:46,358 --> 01:10:48,179
it is actually quite clever.

839
01:10:48,467 --> 01:10:50,863
V for Via, for instance.

840
01:10:51,151 --> 01:10:52,972
A street.

841
01:10:53,164 --> 01:10:55,752
And the numbers would be house numbers.
- Yes, perhaps.

842
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,245
And the second set?
- Number of escapers.

843
01:10:58,532 --> 01:10:59,491
Yes.

844
01:10:59,778 --> 01:11:02,462
Well, the man they picked up
will tell us if I'm right.

845
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:06,968
It shouldn't be too difficult to work out on a map
exactly what areas these numbers represent.

846
01:11:07,351 --> 01:11:09,748
Yes?

847
01:11:10,898 --> 01:11:14,062
That man you wanted?
- Yes? Well, bring him in.

848
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,747
He was released first thing this morning.

849
01:11:17,034 --> 01:11:19,143
<i>What do you mean released?
- From the prison.</i>

850
01:11:19,431 --> 01:11:23,840
They had an order... for his release
signed by you.

851
01:11:24,224 --> 01:11:26,812
That's ridiculous! I never signed anything!

852
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:29,783
It looks like your signature, Colonel.

853
01:11:40,521 --> 01:11:42,917
<i>Golf.</i>

854
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:51,736
Come on, Harry.

855
01:11:51,928 --> 01:11:54,229
Komm her!

856
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:43,023
We're going to need more champagne.
- Ja.

857
01:12:43,311 --> 01:12:45,515
A night to celebrate, sir.
- Indeed it is, Hirsch.

858
01:12:45,803 --> 01:12:48,391
A most successful operation.
- Are you certain, Herbert?

859
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:51,746
Inevitably. With a little persuasion,
the prisoners of war we have

860
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:56,349
will tell us who the others are, and they in turn
will lead us to more men, other hiding places.

861
01:12:56,732 --> 01:12:58,649
And like ripples in the pond...
- Exactly.

862
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:03,921
With great pleasure,
I shall invite Monsignor Golf to visit us.

863
01:13:05,839 --> 01:13:07,372
Well done, Herbert.

864
01:13:07,564 --> 01:13:10,344
I will send a cable at once
to Reichsfuhrer Himmler.

865
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:11,878
Thank you, General.

866
01:13:12,165 --> 01:13:14,466
A clean sweep, gentlemen!
- Prost!

867
01:13:21,177 --> 01:13:22,423
Harry Barnett?

868
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:26,162
Yeah, Paddy was out the window when
he heard the shots, but he's sure Harry's dead.

869
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:29,709
<i>Now they've got his code book as well as mine.
I'll have to warn the others.</i>

870
01:13:30,092 --> 01:13:32,872
Wait a minute, Jack. You're in the Vatican,
you've got to stay here.

871
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:35,556
Outside, you'd be a marked man.
- Forget it, Jack.

872
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:37,761
They've already rounded up 65 of your people.

873
01:13:38,048 --> 01:13:40,541
We've got to move the rest
to the ones in Barnett's sector.

874
01:13:40,733 --> 01:13:42,650
If you save one, you've got to save them all.

875
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:46,101
It's not possible! We've thousands
of escapers on the books at the moment.

876
01:13:46,388 --> 01:13:48,498
Plus all the Italian civilians hiding them.

877
01:13:48,786 --> 01:13:52,620
Monsignor, unless you can pull off a miracle,
this whole thing's finished.

878
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:54,441
Oh, no.

879
01:13:54,633 --> 01:13:56,359
Kappler's won a few rounds.

880
01:13:56,646 --> 01:13:58,468
He's not yet won the fight.

881
01:13:58,755 --> 01:14:01,918
Now, we don't know when or where
the Gestapo will strike next.

882
01:14:02,206 --> 01:14:04,027
Everyone's in danger.

883
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,136
What we've got to do,

884
01:14:06,424 --> 01:14:10,162
<i>is to move our people, all of them,
to safe places immediately.</i>

885
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:12,271
That's going to be some operation.

886
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,669
How do we set it up?

887
01:14:14,956 --> 01:14:17,161
Well, we can count on all our Italian friends.

888
01:14:17,449 --> 01:14:19,653
They're not going to let Kappler win out.

889
01:14:19,941 --> 01:14:21,762
Now, let's get started.

890
01:14:21,954 --> 01:14:23,775
There's a great deal to be done.

891
01:14:24,063 --> 01:14:25,309
Precious little time.

892
01:14:25,597 --> 01:14:27,226
I don't think we can do it in time, sir.

893
01:14:27,514 --> 01:14:29,431
We'll give it a try, lad. And remember,

894
01:14:29,623 --> 01:14:33,649
if we bring this off, it'll be something
you can tell to your grandchildren.

895
01:15:15,254 --> 01:15:16,884
Nothing!

896
01:15:17,171 --> 01:15:18,993
Every apartment empty!

897
01:15:19,184 --> 01:15:23,115
In some, coffeepots still hot, fires burning,
food on the table. Nothing!

898
01:15:23,402 --> 01:15:26,182
How did they all get away?

899
01:15:26,374 --> 01:15:28,195
He did it.

900
01:15:28,483 --> 01:15:30,784
That damned priest.

901
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:34,906
Sir!

902
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,549
This is the caretaker.

903
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:40,178
<i>What can he tell us?
- Go on.</i>

904
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:42,287
Tell him.

905
01:15:42,575 --> 01:15:44,300
It was him.

906
01:15:44,588 --> 01:15:46,409
<i>He wasn't dressed like a priest,</i>

907
01:15:46,601 --> 01:15:49,573
but this is the man who rented the apartment.

908
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,682
<i>I will pick him up immediately.</i>

909
01:15:51,969 --> 01:15:53,695
I wish it was so easy.

910
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:57,626
What do you mean, sir?
- He is still protected by the Vatican.

911
01:15:58,009 --> 01:15:59,831
I will have to go in

912
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:02,419
and ask for him.

913
01:16:02,994 --> 01:16:05,391
Hat in hand!

914
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:28,206
<i>We have respected Vatican territory,</i>

915
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:31,178
but it has been violated again and again!

916
01:16:31,465 --> 01:16:34,725
Then I suggest you make your report
to your authorities, Colonel.

917
01:16:35,108 --> 01:16:36,929
I am the authority in Rome.

918
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:41,147
And I tell you that an illegal organisation exists
which is hiding prisoners of war,

919
01:16:41,435 --> 01:16:43,831
<i>and is being directed by one of your staff.</i>

920
01:16:45,077 --> 01:16:47,953
I want to question him.
- I regret that will not be possible.

921
01:16:49,584 --> 01:16:51,405
You know who I'm talking about.

922
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:53,802
Monsignor O'Flaherty of the Holy Office.

923
01:16:53,993 --> 01:16:56,006
He has charges to answer.

924
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:59,361
I'm afraid I cannot give my permission.

925
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:03,196
I ask only out of courtesy.

926
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:08,085
I intend to question him now.

927
01:17:08,372 --> 01:17:11,152
I know your methods of questioning, Colonel.

928
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:13,069
Even of priests.

929
01:17:13,357 --> 01:17:15,083
<i>May I remind you where you are.</i>

930
01:17:15,371 --> 01:17:19,301
<i>That all my officials here
have diplomatic immunity.</i>

931
01:17:19,589 --> 01:17:21,985
There is nothing more to be said.

932
01:17:28,695 --> 01:17:32,146
If you wish to create an incident here,
Colonel Kappler...

933
01:17:33,393 --> 01:17:35,789
.. please continue.

934
01:17:58,509 --> 01:18:00,138
Kappler.

935
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:02,727
Yes, Herr General.

936
01:18:03,302 --> 01:18:05,698
He's here? In Rome?

937
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,396
Yes. Yes, of course. At once.

938
01:18:11,163 --> 01:18:13,560
Is something wrong?
- No, no, no, nothing.

939
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:19,024
But Herbert, it's five o'clock in the morning.
Will you please tell me what's going on?

940
01:18:19,311 --> 01:18:21,708
I told you, nothing. Now, go back to sleep.

941
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:58,520
General,
Reichsfuhrer Himmler is waiting for you.

942
01:19:00,054 --> 01:19:03,025
I won't forget you said
the whole thing was taken care of.

943
01:19:03,313 --> 01:19:04,847
Why has he come to Italy?

944
01:19:05,134 --> 01:19:08,585
Because whatever happens in Rome
is likely to affect the whole Italian campaign.

945
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:12,228
I wish I hadn't sent that cable.
Best to let sleeping dogs lie.

946
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:14,912
This one could bite our heads off.

947
01:19:15,775 --> 01:19:17,596
<i>At ease, gentlemen.</i>

948
01:19:17,883 --> 01:19:20,184
<i>At ease.</i>

949
01:19:21,910 --> 01:19:25,170
I am delighted to see you again, General Helm.

950
01:19:25,457 --> 01:19:27,375
It's a great honour, Reichsfuhrer.

951
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,963
<i>And you, ColoneI Kappler.</i>

952
01:19:30,154 --> 01:19:31,976
I am to convey to you, General,

953
01:19:32,263 --> 01:19:34,852
the Fuhrer's personal congratulations

954
01:19:35,235 --> 01:19:39,645
on the bravery and devotion of the SS
throughout this Italian campaign.

955
01:19:39,932 --> 01:19:44,054
It is our only wish to be worthy of your trust,
Reichsfuhrer.

956
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:46,738
You have it entirely.

957
01:19:51,149 --> 01:19:53,545
Do you find it cold in here?

958
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:55,846
No, sir.

959
01:19:56,133 --> 01:19:58,338
<i>Damp air, I expect.</i>

960
01:19:58,626 --> 01:20:00,926
Not good for my sinuses.

961
01:20:03,227 --> 01:20:05,048
Several days ago, Colonel,

962
01:20:05,336 --> 01:20:08,308
General Helm sent a cable
informing me of your success...

963
01:20:09,458 --> 01:20:11,950
.. in rooting out all resistance groups in Rome.

964
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:13,484
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

965
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:15,497
It was most encouraging.

966
01:20:15,786 --> 01:20:18,086
I showed it at once to the Fuhrer.

967
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:23,454
The Fuhrer... read it?

968
01:20:23,838 --> 01:20:25,659
More than read it, my dear Colonel.

969
01:20:25,851 --> 01:20:27,960
It became the main subject of our discussion.

970
01:20:28,247 --> 01:20:31,986
It so happened...
it tied in with an important policy matter.

971
01:20:33,232 --> 01:20:36,683
Now I need to know
just how complete your success is.

972
01:20:36,971 --> 01:20:38,792
It's a very big city, sir.

973
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:42,627
Over a million inhabitants, and there are
bound to be one or two spots of unrest.

974
01:20:43,011 --> 01:20:44,832
Quite so. Quite so. Colonel?

975
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:48,187
The teeth of the Resistance have been drawn,
Reichsfuhrer.

976
01:20:48,475 --> 01:20:51,159
We have broken the spirit of the partisans.
- Good.

977
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,268
There are no more incidents.

978
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:54,801
Very good.

979
01:20:54,993 --> 01:20:57,294
But the report referred specifically

980
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:59,882
to the escape organisation.

981
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:03,333
Which you said was controlled...

982
01:21:04,004 --> 01:21:05,825
.. from the Vatican.

983
01:21:06,113 --> 01:21:08,414
You do not mention that.

984
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:12,345
Colonel Kappler has had some success there,
too, Reichsfuhrer.

985
01:21:12,728 --> 01:21:14,549
Some success?

986
01:21:14,837 --> 01:21:17,521
You told me it had been totally destroyed.

987
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:20,397
Er, not entirely, sir. We closed part of it.

988
01:21:20,685 --> 01:21:23,177
In other words, the report was inaccurate.
I was misled.

989
01:21:23,464 --> 01:21:25,957
Not exactly, sir.
I expect to round up those escaped...

990
01:21:26,244 --> 01:21:30,750
What you are admitting...
is that Rome is still not fully under our control.

991
01:21:31,037 --> 01:21:32,284
Is that so?

992
01:21:32,379 --> 01:21:34,777
Is that it?

993
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:40,528
I chose you to go to Rome, Colonel,

994
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:45,992
because I knew that you would allow nothing
to stand in the way of your success. Nothing.

995
01:21:48,197 --> 01:21:50,019
Now I have to go to the Fuhrer,

996
01:21:50,306 --> 01:21:52,607
at a time when he is under great pressure...

997
01:21:53,469 --> 01:21:56,729
.. with the Americans and the British
poised across the English Channel,

998
01:21:57,016 --> 01:22:00,085
with the damnable winter
driving our forces out of Russia,

999
01:22:00,372 --> 01:22:04,303
with our army here in Italy
preparing to fall back before it is encircled...

1000
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:06,220
<i>I am to go to him and say</i>

1001
01:22:06,507 --> 01:22:08,808
I was misinformed.

1002
01:22:10,150 --> 01:22:13,122
That the report
on which he has made vital decisions...

1003
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:16,956
.. was false.

1004
01:22:17,244 --> 01:22:19,161
I could break that organisation

1005
01:22:19,448 --> 01:22:22,708
in one day, Reichsfuhrer.

1006
01:22:22,899 --> 01:22:24,817
Oh, you could, could you?

1007
01:22:25,008 --> 01:22:26,064
How?

1008
01:22:26,351 --> 01:22:27,406
Tell me how.

1009
01:22:27,597 --> 01:22:29,419
The man who runs it is a priest.

1010
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:32,007
Protected by the Vatican.

1011
01:22:33,637 --> 01:22:37,183
If you would just allow me to... go in and get him.

1012
01:22:37,471 --> 01:22:39,772
No, no, no!

1013
01:22:40,443 --> 01:22:42,360
That is one thing you will not do.

1014
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:47,249
It would bring about a crisis affecting policies
far beyond this present situation.

1015
01:22:47,632 --> 01:22:50,029
Rome must belong to us...

1016
01:22:50,795 --> 01:22:53,193
.. so it can be used as bargaining.

1017
01:22:54,918 --> 01:22:57,315
You will not enter the Vatican...

1018
01:22:57,602 --> 01:23:00,478
.. but you will smash that organisation.

1019
01:23:00,862 --> 01:23:03,258
Do you hear me?

1020
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,476
You will do it now.

1021
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:16,966
I chose you for this job, Colonel Kappler.

1022
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,828
I would not like to think I had made a mistake.

1023
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:31,634
Tale Of Vienna Woods

1024
01:24:01,543 --> 01:24:05,761
I'd like to invite you to my party, Monsignor,
but I'm not sure I will.

1025
01:24:06,048 --> 01:24:09,692
Why is that, now?
- You flirt with all the ladies and not just with me.

1026
01:24:09,884 --> 01:24:11,226
Ah, forgive me, Contessa.

1027
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:14,006
When a man in my profession
is surrounded by beautiful women,

1028
01:24:14,293 --> 01:24:16,690
the only safety is in numbers.

1029
01:24:20,716 --> 01:24:22,058
What in hell are you doing here?

1030
01:24:22,345 --> 01:24:25,317
Attending the enemy's parties
is the only way to learn what's going on.

1031
01:24:25,605 --> 01:24:28,097
You should have turned this invitation down.
Kappler is here.

1032
01:24:28,289 --> 01:24:29,247
I've seen him.

1033
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:32,890
Oh, Count, there'll be a load of food supplies
delivered to the consulate tomorrow.

1034
01:24:33,177 --> 01:24:35,671
Some nuns will be around to collect it
in the afternoon.

1035
01:24:36,054 --> 01:24:38,451
Hugh.

1036
01:24:43,148 --> 01:24:45,544
Colonel Kappler! What a surprise.

1037
01:24:45,736 --> 01:24:48,133
Not for me, Monsignor.

1038
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,625
I was looking forward to continuing our talk.

1039
01:24:50,912 --> 01:24:54,555
Were you, now? I would have thought we'd
covered just about everything there was to say.

1040
01:24:54,939 --> 01:24:58,773
Ah, but that was before
I'd given you my... autograph.

1041
01:25:00,019 --> 01:25:02,608
Before I'd heard of your reputation
for being so amusing.

1042
01:25:02,896 --> 01:25:05,292
<i>You also have quite a reputation.
- True.</i>

1043
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:08,264
But I am German, and know my enemies.

1044
01:25:08,647 --> 01:25:10,469
You are Irish.

1045
01:25:10,756 --> 01:25:14,207
How strange to feel such concern
for the enemies of your country.

1046
01:25:14,495 --> 01:25:15,837
Speaking of your enemies,

1047
01:25:16,124 --> 01:25:18,617
that's just about the entire civilised world, isn't it?

1048
01:25:18,904 --> 01:25:21,493
I was told you had wit.
I find you disappointingly obvious.

1049
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:25,423
Well, forgive me. I just wanted to make sure
that you understood my meaning.

1050
01:25:28,204 --> 01:25:30,600
Do not attempt to provoke me.

1051
01:25:32,230 --> 01:25:34,626
I had you invited here to give you a warning.

1052
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:39,899
After tonight, if you take one step
outside the Vatican territory,

1053
01:25:40,378 --> 01:25:41,720
you'll be arrested on sight.

1054
01:25:41,912 --> 01:25:46,321
Colonel, do I get the feeling
that you'd like to put a crimp in my social life?

1055
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:49,580
Damn you and your social life!

1056
01:25:49,868 --> 01:25:53,895
You stay behind that white line, or you'll spend
the rest of the war in Regina Coeli prison.

1057
01:25:54,279 --> 01:25:56,675
The way the war is going,
that might not be long at all.

1058
01:25:56,963 --> 01:25:59,072
<i>You listen to me, priest.
- No, you listen to me!</i>

1059
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:00,797
I'm from a neutral country.

1060
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,714
I have diplomatic immunity.

1061
01:26:03,002 --> 01:26:05,782
I am a member of the Holy Office
of the Catholic Church.

1062
01:26:06,932 --> 01:26:09,329
You cannot tell me what to do.

1063
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:14,121
I... own... Rome.

1064
01:26:15,847 --> 01:26:17,668
Not you,

1065
01:26:17,956 --> 01:26:19,778
not the Pope.

1066
01:26:20,066 --> 01:26:22,462
Just because you wear a frock,
it won't protect you.

1067
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:24,571
Remember your gun-runner priest?

1068
01:26:24,859 --> 01:26:26,393
<i>I do remember him.</i>

1069
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:31,377
And so does every person in Italy
who understands the meaning of freedom.

1070
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:40,196
Get out.

1071
01:26:40,676 --> 01:26:43,072
Get out!

1072
01:26:44,894 --> 01:26:47,578
<i>Go back to the Vatican where you belong.</i>

1073
01:26:48,825 --> 01:26:51,221
This is your last party.

1074
01:27:31,675 --> 01:27:34,263
This is something I wanted you to see,
Monsignor.

1075
01:27:38,769 --> 01:27:41,166
The glories of the Vatican palace...

1076
01:27:41,933 --> 01:27:44,329
.. that I used to love so much when I was a boy...

1077
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:47,205
.. now packed away down here.

1078
01:27:47,397 --> 01:27:51,135
Irreplaceable treasures - Leonardo, Raphael,

1079
01:27:51,423 --> 01:27:56,695
and relics - infinitely more precious -
of Saint Francis, of Saint Catherine of Siena,

1080
01:27:57,174 --> 01:27:59,475
the records and archives, letters,

1081
01:27:59,667 --> 01:28:02,352
from Saint Augustine, Martin Luther,

1082
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:07,145
even from Henry Vlll of England
to the Holy Office seeking for a divorce.

1083
01:28:07,528 --> 01:28:10,021
Nearly two thousand years of history.

1084
01:28:10,308 --> 01:28:12,130
It staggers the mind, Holy Father.

1085
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:14,622
And here it is now, buried beneath the ground

1086
01:28:14,909 --> 01:28:18,169
behind steel doors
from the threats of shells and bombs.

1087
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:22,482
Protected from man's inhumanity.

1088
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:27,659
Our past is full of bloodshed, Monsignor.

1089
01:28:28,714 --> 01:28:30,536
Armies have trampled us,

1090
01:28:30,823 --> 01:28:32,645
yet nothing has changed.

1091
01:28:32,836 --> 01:28:36,191
Conquerors may come and go,
but the eternal Church must remain.

1092
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:39,834
And so it will, Your Holiness.

1093
01:28:40,505 --> 01:28:45,202
I have inherited the responsibility of
all the popes, right back to Saint Peter himself.

1094
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:47,503
My greatest single duty

1095
01:28:47,599 --> 01:28:50,283
is to preserve the continuity of the centuries...

1096
01:28:52,104 --> 01:28:54,885
the heritage and existence of the Holy Church.

1097
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,528
I have been condemned by many...

1098
01:28:59,774 --> 01:29:02,170
<i>.. for not speaking out against Nazism.</i>

1099
01:29:02,937 --> 01:29:05,334
For making a concordat with Hitler...

1100
01:29:05,909 --> 01:29:08,305
.. which guaranteed the life of the Church
in Germany.

1101
01:29:08,689 --> 01:29:11,085
Was I wrong?

1102
01:29:11,852 --> 01:29:15,399
It may not have seemed so at that time,
Holy Father.

1103
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:19,137
Well, perhaps I could have done more.

1104
01:29:23,356 --> 01:29:27,862
The white line is a very precarious boundary
for us now. It's impossible to defend it.

1105
01:29:28,149 --> 01:29:31,217
I was surprised to see
the Palatine Guards carrying arms.

1106
01:29:31,504 --> 01:29:33,134
Only a token.

1107
01:29:33,421 --> 01:29:36,106
I have learned that Hitler
has drawn up plans to invade us,

1108
01:29:36,489 --> 01:29:39,940
and to create a puppet papacy in Liechtenstein
under his control.

1109
01:29:40,227 --> 01:29:42,528
Surely you don't think he'd go as far as that?

1110
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:44,541
That depends on many factors -

1111
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:46,651
on the progress of the war,

1112
01:29:46,843 --> 01:29:49,239
on the result of secret negotiations...

1113
01:29:50,102 --> 01:29:54,512
.. on how great a danger the Vatican seems
to the military authorities here in Rome.

1114
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:56,716
I understand the difficulties.

1115
01:29:56,908 --> 01:29:58,442
I'm glad you do.

1116
01:29:58,729 --> 01:30:03,714
<i>I'm glad you realise that any activities which
give the Nazis an excuse to invade our territory</i>

1117
01:30:04,097 --> 01:30:06,111
must be avoided at all costs.

1118
01:30:06,206 --> 01:30:08,603
<i>All such activities must cease.</i>

1119
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:15,122
The essence of statesmanship
is compromise, Monsignor.

1120
01:30:16,177 --> 01:30:18,477
I'm not a statesman, Your Holiness.

1121
01:30:18,765 --> 01:30:21,161
The questions I ask are more simple.

1122
01:30:21,449 --> 01:30:25,188
I look at things and try to understand them
in simpler ways.

1123
01:30:25,571 --> 01:30:28,063
Yes. What question
are you asking yourself now?

1124
01:30:28,255 --> 01:30:30,652
The only one that seems to matter, Holy Father.

1125
01:30:30,939 --> 01:30:34,486
What is our duty
when we come face to face with evil?

1126
01:30:34,869 --> 01:30:36,307
We must fight it.

1127
01:30:36,499 --> 01:30:38,321
If we must fight,

1128
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:40,239
how can we compromise with it?

1129
01:30:40,526 --> 01:30:42,443
In the abstract, we cannot.

1130
01:30:42,731 --> 01:30:48,770
In practical terms, it is sometimes necessary
to proceed slowly and with caution.

1131
01:30:49,249 --> 01:30:52,988
But isn't that the same as saying
it depends on the circumstances?

1132
01:30:54,617 --> 01:30:56,439
When I was an altar boy,

1133
01:30:56,726 --> 01:31:00,944
the old priest who taught us used to say,
"Do what is right, come hell or high water,

1134
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:03,245
and God will give you the upper hand. "

1135
01:31:03,532 --> 01:31:05,259
Sancta simplicitas.

1136
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:08,135
For some it is easier than others.

1137
01:31:09,381 --> 01:31:11,298
Is it ever right

1138
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:13,886
to see innocent people in mortal danger...

1139
01:31:14,653 --> 01:31:17,050
.. and turn your back on them?

1140
01:31:18,487 --> 01:31:20,788
<i>Holy Father, at this very moment</i>

1141
01:31:21,076 --> 01:31:26,444
I'm responsible for the safety of over 4,000
people hidden in Rome and outside the city.

1142
01:31:28,073 --> 01:31:30,471
So many?

1143
01:31:35,264 --> 01:31:37,660
I have spoken to you from the heart, my son.

1144
01:31:38,811 --> 01:31:41,207
You must do what you believe best.

1145
01:31:41,495 --> 01:31:43,891
<i>Think of what I have said.</i>

1146
01:31:44,466 --> 01:31:46,863
<i>God guide your decision.</i>

1147
01:32:26,838 --> 01:32:29,235
So many are depending on me.

1148
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:34,028
Or is that the sin of pride?

1149
01:32:35,082 --> 01:32:36,904
What should I do?

1150
01:32:37,191 --> 01:32:39,588
If my life could help you, my friend,

1151
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:42,176
I would give it.

1152
01:32:42,943 --> 01:32:45,052
I can give you the blessing of the Church,

1153
01:32:45,339 --> 01:32:47,161
but...

1154
01:32:47,448 --> 01:32:49,750
only you can decide.

1155
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,094
Thank you, Prince Mateo.

1156
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,682
There is more I can do to help.

1157
01:34:22,641 --> 01:34:26,187
Do you have time for some tea?
- That's the one thing I can't resist.

1158
01:34:26,571 --> 01:34:28,871
Only a moment, though.
If I don't get back soon,

1159
01:34:29,159 --> 01:34:32,803
my friends will be as nervous as long-tailed cats
in a room full of rocking chairs.

1160
01:34:39,513 --> 01:34:41,334
The emperors of Rome.

1161
01:34:41,526 --> 01:34:43,251
Masters of the world.

1162
01:34:43,539 --> 01:34:45,360
Were they like the Fuhrer, Pappi?

1163
01:34:45,648 --> 01:34:47,949
<i>A little like him, Franz.</i>

1164
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:50,441
But with a difference.

1165
01:34:50,633 --> 01:34:52,933
The Roman Empire did not survive.

1166
01:34:53,796 --> 01:34:56,192
The Reich will last for a thousand years.

1167
01:34:57,055 --> 01:34:58,494
Yes, Pappi.

1168
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:02,328
One day, you may take my place, huh?

1169
01:35:02,712 --> 01:35:04,533
And then, in time,

1170
01:35:04,821 --> 01:35:07,121
your sons will grow up and carry on the work.

1171
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:17,570
It's definite.
The Germans are pulling back in the south.

1172
01:35:17,858 --> 01:35:20,158
They can no longer hold their defence lines.

1173
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:24,090
If they're true to form, though,
they'll not give up without a hell of a fight.

1174
01:35:24,473 --> 01:35:26,774
Still, it's good to hear.

1175
01:35:26,965 --> 01:35:28,787
Thank you again, Prince.

1176
01:35:29,074 --> 01:35:31,375
I wish I could do more, Hugh.

1177
01:35:32,046 --> 01:35:34,442
Like many others, I would like to...

1178
01:35:47,479 --> 01:35:49,877
The Gestapo! Quickly!

1179
01:35:50,068 --> 01:35:51,986
Leutnant, take some men and cover the exits.

1180
01:35:52,273 --> 01:35:54,574
The rest of you, up those stairs and spread out!

1181
01:35:56,491 --> 01:35:59,175
Remember, I want him alive.

1182
01:35:59,463 --> 01:36:01,859
This door leads to the kitchen.

1183
01:36:02,722 --> 01:36:04,160
Hide in one of the storerooms.

1184
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,173
I'll try to hold them as long as I can.

1185
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,761
Good luck.

1186
01:36:09,432 --> 01:36:11,253
What is the meaning of this?

1187
01:36:11,541 --> 01:36:13,842
Do you know who I am?

1188
01:36:14,321 --> 01:36:16,623
It's an outrage! I shall speak to your superiors!

1189
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:19,594
Where is he? Where is O'Flaherty?
- What are you talking about?

1190
01:36:19,882 --> 01:36:23,045
He was seen here. He's with you.
- What a ridiculous accusation, Colonel.

1191
01:36:23,333 --> 01:36:26,592
<i>Quite obviously he is not here.
- Spread out! Search every room!</i>

1192
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:07,909
Finish your work.

1193
01:37:08,101 --> 01:37:09,922
Get out.

1194
01:37:10,210 --> 01:37:12,511
Druben.

1195
01:37:17,879 --> 01:37:19,413
<i>Don't look round.</i>

1196
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,042
<i>Don't even move.</i>

1197
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:22,480
Who are you?

1198
01:37:22,672 --> 01:37:25,643
A priest. It's me the Gestapo are after.

1199
01:37:26,027 --> 01:37:27,944
What do you want me to do?

1200
01:37:28,232 --> 01:37:30,532
Just climb down here.

1201
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,886
Well, what do you think?

1202
01:37:41,174 --> 01:37:43,570
What happens to me if they recognise you?

1203
01:37:45,583 --> 01:37:46,925
You'd better hit me, Father.

1204
01:37:47,213 --> 01:37:49,418
Holy Mother!

1205
01:37:49,705 --> 01:37:52,006
Are you sure?
- Right here.

1206
01:37:52,773 --> 01:37:55,169
God bless you.

1207
01:38:16,068 --> 01:38:17,889
Hey, coalman!

1208
01:38:18,176 --> 01:38:19,710
Yup.

1209
01:38:19,902 --> 01:38:21,723
That's enough work. Get out of here.

1210
01:38:22,011 --> 01:38:24,311
Ja.

1211
01:39:00,069 --> 01:39:02,466
You're a dead man, priest.

1212
01:42:35,473 --> 01:42:38,062
It was sheer luck they missed. You know that.

1213
01:42:38,445 --> 01:42:40,266
Keep telling him that, Francesca.

1214
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:42,375
But I can't stay cooped up in here.

1215
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:44,677
Don't you understand?
They are going to kill you.

1216
01:42:44,869 --> 01:42:46,307
Come in!

1217
01:42:46,594 --> 01:42:48,320
Ah, Sister Candida.

1218
01:42:48,607 --> 01:42:50,428
Come on in. Ah, you're an angel.

1219
01:42:50,716 --> 01:42:53,304
You're an angel.
Thank you, my dear. Thank you.

1220
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:56,947
You've done enough, Hugh.

1221
01:42:57,139 --> 01:42:58,577
It's not so urgent now.

1222
01:42:58,768 --> 01:43:01,069
The Allies will be here in a few weeks.

1223
01:43:02,507 --> 01:43:04,424
Hey, are you listening?

1224
01:43:04,712 --> 01:43:07,012
What on earth are you doing?

1225
01:43:27,335 --> 01:43:29,157
Buongiorno, Capitano.

1226
01:43:29,444 --> 01:43:32,512
How about a special portrait
of His Holiness the Pope, huh?

1227
01:43:32,704 --> 01:43:35,388
Go away.
- It is blessed by the Holy Father himself.

1228
01:43:35,675 --> 01:43:37,498
No? No.

1229
01:43:37,785 --> 01:43:40,182
How about a medallion of Saint Christopher?
Huh?

1230
01:43:40,469 --> 01:43:42,866
Sehr billig. Very cheap.

1231
01:43:43,249 --> 01:43:45,550
I told you to leave me alone! Get out of here!

1232
01:44:18,431 --> 01:44:20,348
Good morning, Guila.

1233
01:44:20,539 --> 01:44:22,648
Monsignor!
- Don't go bobbing at me, now.

1234
01:44:22,936 --> 01:44:26,674
Now, tell your mother to expect
three more boarders just for two nights.

1235
01:44:27,058 --> 01:44:29,168
Oh, and Jack sends his love.

1236
01:44:29,455 --> 01:44:31,564
<i>How is he?
- He's going crazy in the Vatican.</i>

1237
01:44:31,852 --> 01:44:33,769
I don't think he's cut out to be a priest.

1238
01:44:34,057 --> 01:44:35,207
But he's fine.

1239
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,987
Goodbye for now.
I'm getting behind in my sweeping.

1240
01:45:45,378 --> 01:45:47,680
<i>He has been reported all over the city, sir.</i>

1241
01:45:48,063 --> 01:45:49,789
Dressed as a dustman, a coalman,

1242
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:52,473
an ambulance driver, a mailman.

1243
01:45:52,856 --> 01:45:55,828
The Angel Gabriel, no doubt.
People will swallow any nonsense.

1244
01:45:56,115 --> 01:45:58,608
Even the ridiculous story
that he dressed up as a nun.

1245
01:45:58,799 --> 01:46:00,908
People will believe anything about him.

1246
01:46:01,196 --> 01:46:02,634
He must be stopped.

1247
01:46:02,921 --> 01:46:05,222
We have tried everything, sir.

1248
01:46:05,414 --> 01:46:07,810
No.

1249
01:46:08,385 --> 01:46:10,782
Not quite everything.

1250
01:47:05,137 --> 01:47:09,067
Well, it's not that I'm not glad to see you, Alfred...

1251
01:47:10,314 --> 01:47:12,518
.. but where in the holy name
did you come from?

1252
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:16,353
Well, seeing as they didn't get you outside,
it was a safe bet they'd come in after you.

1253
01:47:16,736 --> 01:47:18,462
So I've been watching your back.

1254
01:47:18,749 --> 01:47:21,050
God bless you.

1255
01:47:54,027 --> 01:47:56,424
Bang! Bang! You're dead, Pappi!

1256
01:47:56,808 --> 01:47:58,821
You never do that again! Do you hear me?

1257
01:47:59,108 --> 01:48:00,354
Never!

1258
01:48:00,546 --> 01:48:02,367
Herbert! What...?

1259
01:48:02,655 --> 01:48:05,435
You poor darling. It's all right, it's all right.

1260
01:48:05,722 --> 01:48:07,831
Did you hit him?

1261
01:48:08,119 --> 01:48:10,324
You've never touched the children.

1262
01:48:10,611 --> 01:48:13,679
You've never raised your voice at them
in all their lives.

1263
01:48:48,574 --> 01:48:51,258
Be a good girl. I'll be seeing you later.

1264
01:48:51,545 --> 01:48:53,846
Goodbye, Sister.

1265
01:49:13,498 --> 01:49:15,319
Hugh.
- Yes.

1266
01:49:15,607 --> 01:49:17,141
Alfred told me.

1267
01:49:17,428 --> 01:49:21,263
Thank God you're safe.
- Don't you go thinking I'm that easy to get rid of.

1268
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:23,947
Please, don't joke.

1269
01:49:24,810 --> 01:49:26,631
You haven't heard?

1270
01:49:26,918 --> 01:49:29,219
Heard what?

1271
01:49:30,369 --> 01:49:32,191
Father Vittorio.

1272
01:49:32,478 --> 01:49:35,929
Kappler has him at Gestapo headquarters.
- No, no.

1273
01:49:36,121 --> 01:49:38,805
No, no. He left Rome three days ago,

1274
01:49:39,189 --> 01:49:41,203
to visit our billets in the country.

1275
01:49:41,394 --> 01:49:43,887
He never got there. The SS stopped him.

1276
01:49:45,133 --> 01:49:46,954
They found money.

1277
01:49:47,242 --> 01:49:49,063
They think he's a British spy.

1278
01:49:49,351 --> 01:49:52,610
He's being interrogated at Regina Coeli,
but has told them nothing.

1279
01:49:52,897 --> 01:49:56,732
<i>He's being moved tomorrow
to a concentration camp in Germany.</i>

1280
01:49:57,019 --> 01:49:59,416
Oh, my God.

1281
01:50:01,333 --> 01:50:03,634
I've got to go to him. Right away.

1282
01:50:03,921 --> 01:50:05,648
You know that's impossible.

1283
01:50:05,935 --> 01:50:08,332
You might as well give yourself up.

1284
01:50:10,057 --> 01:50:13,125
I'm going to hear his confession
and give him absolution.

1285
01:50:14,371 --> 01:50:16,767
Nothing on God's earth will stop me.

1286
01:51:35,950 --> 01:51:38,347
Leave us, Leutnant.

1287
01:51:51,672 --> 01:51:54,452
What have they done to you, my friend?

1288
01:51:55,794 --> 01:51:58,191
It's really you?

1289
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:01,067
Here.

1290
01:52:01,354 --> 01:52:03,175
It's holy water,

1291
01:52:03,463 --> 01:52:05,764
but all the better for that.

1292
01:52:11,995 --> 01:52:13,816
Too dangerous.

1293
01:52:14,008 --> 01:52:16,118
You should not have come.

1294
01:52:16,501 --> 01:52:18,802
Oh, I had to, my dear friend.

1295
01:52:21,773 --> 01:52:24,170
We shall not meet again, I think.

1296
01:52:27,908 --> 01:52:31,455
I came... to give you absolution.

1297
01:52:33,085 --> 01:52:35,385
Thank you.

1298
01:52:35,577 --> 01:52:38,261
I have already made confession to God.

1299
01:52:39,795 --> 01:52:43,343
<i>I heard something when they tortured me.</i>

1300
01:52:46,314 --> 01:52:50,916
You must not go again to Francesca's.

1301
01:52:52,449 --> 01:52:54,271
Why not?

1302
01:52:54,558 --> 01:52:56,859
<i>Her apartment is being watched...</i>

1303
01:52:58,201 --> 01:53:00,693
<i>.. in case you go there.</i>

1304
01:53:00,981 --> 01:53:03,377
You're sure, Vittorio?

1305
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:06,733
Kappler...

1306
01:53:07,021 --> 01:53:09,609
could not make me talk,

1307
01:53:09,993 --> 01:53:12,293
but he talked...

1308
01:53:12,868 --> 01:53:16,511
.. as if I... I was already dead.

1309
01:53:16,894 --> 01:53:21,112
<i>He will have her arrested any time now.</i>

1310
01:53:31,849 --> 01:53:33,575
Here.

1311
01:53:33,863 --> 01:53:36,163
This is for you.

1312
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:40,956
Please... take it with you.

1313
01:53:47,666 --> 01:53:49,584
Hail Mary,

1314
01:53:49,871 --> 01:53:51,980
full of grace,

1315
01:53:52,172 --> 01:53:53,418
the Lord is with thee.

1316
01:53:53,705 --> 01:53:56,198
<i>Blessed art thou among women.</i>

1317
01:53:56,390 --> 01:53:59,746
<i>And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

1318
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:02,238
Holy Mary,

1319
01:54:02,526 --> 01:54:04,155
Mother of God,

1320
01:54:04,443 --> 01:54:07,606
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

1321
01:54:08,852 --> 01:54:11,249
Amen.

1322
01:54:33,585 --> 01:54:37,419
Guila, you take Tate and the others
to San Giovanni Maggiore.

1323
01:54:37,803 --> 01:54:39,432
Tell them that I sent you.

1324
01:54:39,624 --> 01:54:43,267
This building's being watched, so use
the cellar door and go out through the garden.

1325
01:54:43,650 --> 01:54:45,472
You got friends you can stay with?
- Yes.

1326
01:54:45,759 --> 01:54:47,389
Go to them as soon as the others are clear.

1327
01:54:47,676 --> 01:54:50,170
Don't take anything but your purse.
- Yes, Monsignor.

1328
01:54:52,375 --> 01:54:53,812
I'm not leaving Emilia with anyone.

1329
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:57,167
She's going with us.
I'm going to get you safely out of Rome.

1330
01:54:58,797 --> 01:55:00,523
There is no doubt about it, Colonel.

1331
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:02,823
He was in an SS uniform.

1332
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:05,987
He was seen entering the woman's apartment.
It must have been him.

1333
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:08,000
By the time the alert was put out,

1334
01:55:08,287 --> 01:55:10,875
he had left the city and driven through the gates.

1335
01:55:11,163 --> 01:55:14,806
I want every approach to the Vatican sealed off.

1336
01:55:17,011 --> 01:55:19,408
Put out his description.

1337
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:23,722
I want every available man in the streets.

1338
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:29,186
And get him.

1339
01:55:34,170 --> 01:55:36,567
Get him.

1340
01:55:41,264 --> 01:55:43,757
Allies will be here in a week or so.

1341
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:47,016
Germans will be driven out of Rome
and you can return.

1342
01:55:47,304 --> 01:55:49,701
Stay with us.

1343
01:55:49,988 --> 01:55:53,631
There's nothing I'd want more, Francesca,
than to stay here, but...

1344
01:55:54,877 --> 01:55:56,123
.. I can't.

1345
01:55:56,411 --> 01:55:59,574
If the Germans break our escape line,
I have to be there to do what I can.

1346
01:55:59,862 --> 01:56:03,984
I have a terrible feeling
that I might never see you again.

1347
01:56:04,367 --> 01:56:06,955
I told you. I'm not that easy to get rid of.

1348
01:56:07,147 --> 01:56:09,544
Please, Hugh, don't go.

1349
01:56:11,174 --> 01:56:13,571
I'm sorry.

1350
01:56:14,433 --> 01:56:17,692
You've given so much of your strength to others.

1351
01:56:18,076 --> 01:56:19,801
I don't want to take what's left of it.

1352
01:56:19,993 --> 01:56:22,965
Oh, I'm just stubborn.
You're the one who's strong.

1353
01:56:23,156 --> 01:56:25,457
I thought I was.

1354
01:56:25,745 --> 01:56:28,620
I thought there was a good God looking after us

1355
01:56:29,004 --> 01:56:31,305
who would make sure
everything turned out all right.

1356
01:56:31,592 --> 01:56:33,605
And he will do.

1357
01:56:33,798 --> 01:56:35,619
I'll try to believe that.

1358
01:56:35,907 --> 01:56:38,207
Of course you will.

1359
01:57:16,265 --> 01:57:19,428
<i>So, after months of stalemate,
our forces are on the move again.</i>

1360
01:57:19,716 --> 01:57:22,879
<i>US and British divisions
under the command of GeneraI Mark Clark</i>

1361
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:27,002
<i>have broken out of the Anzio beachhead and
are attacking the Nazi stronghold of Cisterna,</i>

1362
01:57:27,385 --> 01:57:30,261
<i>driving the enemy to the hills
where they are pounded day and night</i>

1363
01:57:30,453 --> 01:57:32,082
<i>by our tanks and dive bombers.</i>

1364
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,958
<i>The Canadians
have broken through the Hitler Line,</i>

1365
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:38,313
<i>and GeneraI Alexander's Eighth Army
has crossed the river,</i>

1366
01:57:38,697 --> 01:57:41,093
<i>taking 10,000 German prisoners.</i>

1367
01:57:41,381 --> 01:57:43,777
<i>The battles of Anzio and Cassino are over.</i>

1368
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:49,241
<i>And injust a few days now,
the big one will begin.</i>

1369
01:57:50,583 --> 01:57:52,981
<i>The battle for Rome.</i>

1370
01:58:10,811 --> 01:58:13,207
Herr Major? Moment, bitte.

1371
01:58:15,124 --> 01:58:17,522
Herr Major, Moment.

1372
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:20,398
Halt!

1373
01:58:23,082 --> 01:58:25,478
Dahinten.

1374
01:58:29,121 --> 01:58:31,517
Schnell. Schnell!

1375
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:34,777
Nachher.

1376
01:58:44,459 --> 01:58:46,856
<i>Schnell.</i>

1377
01:58:48,486 --> 01:58:50,882
<i>Er muss in die Kirche sein.</i>

1378
02:00:04,889 --> 02:00:07,285
Herbert?

1379
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:11,215
So late, darling. Where have you been?

1380
02:00:12,174 --> 02:00:14,570
Military headquarters.

1381
02:00:18,884 --> 02:00:21,281
Minna...

1382
02:00:25,786 --> 02:00:28,183
.. first thing in the morning, I want you to pack.

1383
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,443
What?

1384
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:33,360
In two days,

1385
02:00:33,552 --> 02:00:35,852
three at the most...

1386
02:00:36,907 --> 02:00:38,440
.. we evacuate Rome.

1387
02:00:38,728 --> 02:00:41,604
But you were ready to defend it.
You said we had weeks yet.

1388
02:00:41,891 --> 02:00:46,301
It is not to be defended, or attacked, it seems.

1389
02:00:47,739 --> 02:00:51,381
This way, Rome is saved and we save our army.

1390
02:00:53,971 --> 02:00:57,326
You'll... you'll have to give me
some crates and some boxes and...

1391
02:00:57,613 --> 02:01:00,393
There's no point.
You can only take what you need.

1392
02:01:00,681 --> 02:01:03,940
What about my things? I can't just leave them.
- You'll have to.

1393
02:01:04,323 --> 02:01:06,049
Herbert, I won't. All my things. I just...

1394
02:01:06,337 --> 02:01:08,637
Don't you understand?

1395
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:12,759
You'll be lucky to get away.

1396
02:01:19,854 --> 02:01:21,771
I don't know what you're talking about.

1397
02:01:21,963 --> 02:01:24,551
You said there was no danger.
What about the children?

1398
02:01:24,838 --> 02:01:27,235
Listen to me. Listen.

1399
02:01:28,002 --> 02:01:30,398
Up until yesterday, there was no problem.

1400
02:01:31,549 --> 02:01:35,383
But now, it's chaos here.

1401
02:01:35,766 --> 02:01:38,067
There's no transport left.

1402
02:01:39,026 --> 02:01:41,422
I have to arrange something.

1403
02:01:42,572 --> 02:01:44,970
Will you come with us?

1404
02:01:45,353 --> 02:01:47,750
That might not be possible.

1405
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:53,022
But you and the children must be ready.

1406
02:02:02,512 --> 02:02:04,909
Where are you going?

1407
02:02:05,388 --> 02:02:08,647
There's still something I have to do.
- What?

1408
02:02:09,031 --> 02:02:11,045
Herbert?

1409
02:02:11,332 --> 02:02:13,633
Herbert.

1410
02:02:45,172 --> 02:02:47,760
Call for help and you are dead.

1411
02:02:50,732 --> 02:02:53,511
You're going to kill me anyway.
- Not if you listen.

1412
02:02:53,799 --> 02:02:58,209
I have come here personally
with a message from Colonel Kappler.

1413
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:00,605
He wishes to see you.

1414
02:03:00,893 --> 02:03:04,345
At Gestapo Headquarters, no doubt.

1415
02:03:04,728 --> 02:03:07,125
This is to be a private meeting.

1416
02:03:08,179 --> 02:03:10,192
Tonight, just the two of you.

1417
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,780
Your safety is guaranteed.

1418
02:03:13,068 --> 02:03:15,464
Guaranteed, is it?

1419
02:03:16,135 --> 02:03:18,532
Where?

1420
02:03:19,203 --> 02:03:21,599
The Colosseum.

1421
02:04:00,904 --> 02:04:03,300
You alone?
- I am.

1422
02:04:03,875 --> 02:04:05,217
Not afraid I'll shoot you?

1423
02:04:05,409 --> 02:04:08,668
If you'd been going to kill me, your man
would already have done it in my room.

1424
02:04:09,052 --> 02:04:11,448
That is so.

1425
02:04:12,023 --> 02:04:15,666
But believe me, at this moment,
nothing would give me greater pleasure.

1426
02:04:16,049 --> 02:04:20,363
When it comes down to it, a bullet's your answer
to just about everything, isn't it?

1427
02:04:20,748 --> 02:04:22,377
The only argument you've got.

1428
02:04:22,569 --> 02:04:25,828
I know what you think of me,
you and your Church, but you forget...

1429
02:04:27,074 --> 02:04:28,800
I have my orders.

1430
02:04:29,087 --> 02:04:31,388
I am a soldier. I do my duty.

1431
02:04:31,867 --> 02:04:35,606
You can't hide behind that, Kappler.
Don't debase the word "duty".

1432
02:04:35,893 --> 02:04:39,249
My orders were to occupy Rome, control the city.

1433
02:04:39,536 --> 02:04:42,124
In a war, that means whatever it takes to do it,

1434
02:04:42,412 --> 02:04:43,658
whether you like it or not.

1435
02:04:43,946 --> 02:04:46,439
And do you think that absolves you
of any responsibility?

1436
02:04:46,631 --> 02:04:48,452
Yes.

1437
02:04:48,740 --> 02:04:51,040
What is important is the Reich.

1438
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:53,724
Not Rome. What is Rome?

1439
02:04:54,683 --> 02:04:57,175
All its greatness is over.

1440
02:04:57,559 --> 02:04:59,859
All that's left is a picture postcard,

1441
02:05:00,147 --> 02:05:02,352
a playground for whores and priests.

1442
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:05,227
<i>There will be a new order in Europe.</i>

1443
02:05:06,378 --> 02:05:09,349
We are evacuating Rome now,
but that means nothing.

1444
02:05:09,733 --> 02:05:11,362
We will be back.

1445
02:05:11,650 --> 02:05:15,198
The Third Reich... is the future.

1446
02:05:15,485 --> 02:05:19,128
How many murderous dictators
have talked that kind of rubbish?

1447
02:05:20,854 --> 02:05:22,291
Just look around you, Kappler.

1448
02:05:22,483 --> 02:05:25,934
You're standing where your ancient friends
entertained themselves,

1449
02:05:26,222 --> 02:05:28,331
watching lions tear the Christians to pieces,

1450
02:05:28,618 --> 02:05:31,398
but the Church is still here.

1451
02:05:31,590 --> 02:05:34,274
A lot of broken stones like these.

1452
02:05:34,657 --> 02:05:37,821
In a few years,
that's all that'll be left of your Third Reich.

1453
02:05:38,108 --> 02:05:39,643
Keep your history lesson, priest.

1454
02:05:39,931 --> 02:05:43,765
You crawl to your pope and obey his orders,
just as I obey mine.

1455
02:05:44,148 --> 02:05:46,641
You compare obedience to Hitler

1456
02:05:46,928 --> 02:05:49,229
with the faith a priest owes to his Church?

1457
02:05:50,188 --> 02:05:52,584
You think that's the same?

1458
02:05:53,063 --> 02:05:54,214
In the name of God!

1459
02:05:54,405 --> 02:05:56,706
Wait.

1460
02:05:57,185 --> 02:05:59,582
I know about you.

1461
02:05:59,869 --> 02:06:01,691
And your Church.

1462
02:06:01,978 --> 02:06:04,376
I've been... talking to people.

1463
02:06:05,622 --> 02:06:08,018
I know all about you.

1464
02:06:17,413 --> 02:06:19,809
What is it you want from me...

1465
02:06:20,097 --> 02:06:21,343
.. Kappler?

1466
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:25,657
They say that you can't pass a beggar...

1467
02:06:26,999 --> 02:06:29,395
.. or a lame dog...

1468
02:06:30,642 --> 02:06:33,422
.. but that you see yourself
with some sort of obligation

1469
02:06:33,710 --> 02:06:36,969
to look after... anyone in trouble.

1470
02:06:37,352 --> 02:06:40,228
You help British and American prisoners.

1471
02:06:41,474 --> 02:06:44,734
Jews, Arabs, refugees, anybody.

1472
02:06:45,117 --> 02:06:48,664
It's a... part of your faith.

1473
02:06:50,198 --> 02:06:51,444
Is that right?

1474
02:06:51,731 --> 02:06:54,703
Well, I wouldn't deny it.
That's why I became a priest.

1475
02:06:54,991 --> 02:06:57,100
Brotherly love

1476
02:06:57,388 --> 02:06:59,114
and forgiveness.

1477
02:06:59,401 --> 02:07:03,811
That's... the other half of what you believe.

1478
02:07:04,194 --> 02:07:05,728
<i>True?</i>

1479
02:07:06,015 --> 02:07:06,782
True.

1480
02:07:07,070 --> 02:07:09,371
Well, I'm glad of it...

1481
02:07:09,658 --> 02:07:12,821
.. because I have three more
for your mercy wagon.

1482
02:07:13,109 --> 02:07:15,026
My wife...

1483
02:07:15,314 --> 02:07:17,231
and two children.

1484
02:07:17,519 --> 02:07:20,203
<i>If the partisans get them, they will be killed.</i>

1485
02:07:20,394 --> 02:07:22,504
I want them out of Rome

1486
02:07:22,792 --> 02:07:25,092
and safe.

1487
02:07:25,955 --> 02:07:28,352
That's what I want from you, priest.

1488
02:07:29,598 --> 02:07:32,953
You're asking me to save your family?

1489
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:36,020
If you really believe what you preach...

1490
02:07:37,362 --> 02:07:38,513
.. you'll do it.

1491
02:07:38,609 --> 02:07:42,539
You expect me to help you
after what you've done?

1492
02:07:44,264 --> 02:07:46,661
You think you can demand forgiveness?

1493
02:07:47,236 --> 02:07:49,250
You think it comes automatically

1494
02:07:49,538 --> 02:07:50,688
<i>just because you want it?</i>

1495
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:52,030
I'm not talking about myself.

1496
02:07:52,318 --> 02:07:55,673
You've turned this city
into a concentration camp.

1497
02:07:56,919 --> 02:07:59,315
You've tortured and butchered my friends.

1498
02:07:59,603 --> 02:08:02,575
You've violated every principle of God and man.

1499
02:08:06,121 --> 02:08:08,518
I can't believe that after all you've done,

1500
02:08:08,805 --> 02:08:10,243
you want mercy.

1501
02:08:10,435 --> 02:08:12,640
I've told you, for my family.

1502
02:08:12,927 --> 02:08:14,941
They're just part of you,

1503
02:08:15,229 --> 02:08:16,763
part of what you stand for.

1504
02:08:17,050 --> 02:08:19,063
They've taken whatever they could get

1505
02:08:19,255 --> 02:08:22,227
without a thought
for the suffering all around them.

1506
02:08:22,418 --> 02:08:25,774
And now you demand that they be saved.

1507
02:08:29,512 --> 02:08:31,909
I'll see you in hell first.

1508
02:08:34,017 --> 02:08:36,222
No.

1509
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,235
You're no different from anyone else.

1510
02:08:38,523 --> 02:08:41,304
All your talk means nothing.

1511
02:08:42,646 --> 02:08:46,193
Charity, forgiveness, mercy.

1512
02:08:47,631 --> 02:08:49,356
It's all lies.

1513
02:08:49,644 --> 02:08:51,944
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1514
02:08:52,711 --> 02:08:55,108
<i>Lies!</i>

1515
02:08:55,683 --> 02:08:58,079
Don't you talk to me about God...

1516
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:01,338
.. and humanity.

1517
02:09:01,626 --> 02:09:03,927
I know what humanity is.

1518
02:09:04,598 --> 02:09:08,145
It's one half with the power and the will to use it,

1519
02:09:08,529 --> 02:09:11,213
and the other half only cattle to be led.

1520
02:09:14,185 --> 02:09:16,581
There's no God.

1521
02:09:17,444 --> 02:09:19,840
No humanity.

1522
02:09:20,607 --> 02:09:22,812
Do you hear me?

1523
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:25,400
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1524
02:09:26,934 --> 02:09:29,330
<i>Priest?</i>

1525
02:09:30,193 --> 02:09:32,591
<i>Priest!</i>

1526
02:10:20,234 --> 02:10:22,726
Everybody, just a minute.

1527
02:10:25,315 --> 02:10:27,999
Guila and I have decided
we don't want to wait any longer.

1528
02:10:28,383 --> 02:10:32,217
We want to be married.
- Oh, well done, Jack. Congratulations!

1529
02:10:32,505 --> 02:10:34,805
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1530
02:10:35,668 --> 02:10:37,298
And we want you to tie the knot, Padre.

1531
02:10:37,394 --> 02:10:39,886
It's about time, Jack.
I've had the rope ready for months.

1532
02:10:40,269 --> 02:10:42,570
If you'll pardon me, ladies and gentlemen,

1533
02:10:42,858 --> 02:10:47,075
we've all come through
and it's thanks to one man.

1534
02:10:47,459 --> 02:10:48,897
I think we ought to have a toast.

1535
02:10:48,993 --> 02:10:51,007
Monsignor O'Flaherty.

1536
02:10:51,198 --> 02:10:52,445
Thank you, my friends.

1537
02:10:52,732 --> 02:10:55,512
But if we're to have a toast,
I can think of another one.

1538
02:10:57,525 --> 02:10:59,538
To those we loved,

1539
02:10:59,826 --> 02:11:01,935
those who cannot be here with us today.

1540
02:11:02,222 --> 02:11:04,523
Hear, hear.

1541
02:11:10,083 --> 02:11:14,492
This is only the first inquiry into your activities
as Head of the Gestapo here in Rome.

1542
02:11:14,876 --> 02:11:17,944
Do you deny the systematic use of torture
on suspects?

1543
02:11:18,232 --> 02:11:20,532
Only the accepted methods of interrogation
were used.

1544
02:11:20,820 --> 02:11:24,463
That is not our information.
- I only did my duty.

1545
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:27,147
Tell us about the pipeline.

1546
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:32,707
Come now, Colonel, it is quite obvious
that after your forces retreated,

1547
02:11:32,898 --> 02:11:35,966
you were ordered to set up
a secret line of communication.

1548
02:11:36,349 --> 02:11:39,417
Colonel Kappler,
we know all about your wife and children.

1549
02:11:40,855 --> 02:11:42,294
Minna, isn't it?

1550
02:11:42,581 --> 02:11:44,882
<i>And Franz and Liesel?</i>

1551
02:11:46,799 --> 02:11:49,195
What do you know?

1552
02:11:49,675 --> 02:11:52,071
What has happened to them?

1553
02:11:52,359 --> 02:11:54,755
<i>Now you're playing games, ColoneI.</i>

1554
02:11:55,426 --> 02:11:57,631
<i>Your wife and children disappeared from Rome.</i>

1555
02:11:57,823 --> 02:12:01,178
<i>They were smuggled into Switzerland,
as you well know,</i>

1556
02:12:01,465 --> 02:12:03,862
<i>safe and sound.</i>

1557
02:12:05,492 --> 02:12:07,506
<i>Now, how was it done?</i>

1558
02:12:07,793 --> 02:12:09,998
<i>Who helped them?</i>

1559
02:12:10,286 --> 02:12:12,682
<i>That takes some organisation.</i>

1560
02:12:13,641 --> 02:12:15,654
<i>Now, if you tell us how it was done,</i>

1561
02:12:15,941 --> 02:12:17,667
<i>and who helped them,</i>

1562
02:12:17,954 --> 02:12:20,255
<i>it might do you some good at your triaI.</i>

1563
02:12:23,035 --> 02:12:25,431
I do not know.

1564
02:12:28,115 --> 02:12:30,033
<i>Come on, ColoneI.</i>

1565
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,621
<i>Tell us. Who was it?</i>

1566
02:12:39,044 --> 02:12:41,441
I do not know.

1567
02:12:46,521 --> 02:12:48,918
Stay where you are, my son.

1568
02:12:49,972 --> 02:12:52,369
No need to rise.

1569
02:12:54,478 --> 02:12:55,916
I have only a few moments.

1570
02:12:56,107 --> 02:12:58,791
This is a great day.
I have to speak to our people.

1571
02:12:59,079 --> 02:13:01,477
But first, I wanted to speak to you.

1572
02:13:02,243 --> 02:13:06,365
In this imperfect world, you may never receive
the honour that is due to you.

1573
02:13:07,612 --> 02:13:10,104
But I wanted you to know that in my heart...

1574
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:12,596
.. I honour you.

1575
02:13:12,884 --> 02:13:15,951
<i>I talked to you once
of the treasures of the Church.</i>

1576
02:13:17,197 --> 02:13:19,019
<i>Perhaps I deceived myself.</i>

1577
02:13:19,211 --> 02:13:23,237
The real treasures of the Church,
what makes it imperishable...

1578
02:13:24,675 --> 02:13:27,072
.. is that every once in a while

1579
02:13:27,264 --> 02:13:29,660
someone comes to it, my son...

1580
02:13:30,427 --> 02:13:32,824
.. like you.

1581
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,396
May the Lord watch over you.

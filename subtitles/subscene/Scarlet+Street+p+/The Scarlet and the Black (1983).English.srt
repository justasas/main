1
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Holy Father, may I present General Helm,
Commander of the SS in Italy?

2
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,700
Your Holiness,
I've come to pay you my respects...

3
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,400
.. and to inform you officially
that the German army is in total control of Rome.

4
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,400
In other words, General,
your forces have occupied our city.

5
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,000
And I'm to convey
the Fuhrer's personal guarantee

6
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,300
that Vatican neutrality
will continue to be respected.

7
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,700
<i>In return, I would ask Your Holiness to confirm</i>

8
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,800
in your communiques, German troops,
particularly the SS detachments,

9
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,600
are behaving correctly and with restraint.

10
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,300
<i>I shall be happy to report
that you have asked me to confirm that, General.</i>

11
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,100
May I present Colonel Herbert Kappler?

12
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,700
<i>ColoneI Kappler has been personally selected
by Reichsfuhrer Himmler</i>

13
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,400
<i>as Head of Police in Rome.</i>

14
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,900
<i>I am relieved to hear that the German police
consider it their duty to protect ordinary citizens.</i>

15
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
My duty is to maintain order in the streets,
discourage resistance,

16
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,900
and to round up escaped prisoners.

17
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,300
<i>Prisoners?
- After Italy's capitulation,</i>

18
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,500
many enemy prisoners of war
escaped from prison camps,

19
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,700
which were left unguarded.

20
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,700
And we have reason to believe
that large numbers are heading for Rome.

21
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,000
Some may even be making for the Vatican...
to seek refuge.

22
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,500
<i>These, of course, will be arrested
before they reach here, but,</i>

23
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,600
in case of unfortunate incidents, I intend,
with your permission,

24
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,900
to have a white line drawn across
the opening of St Peter's Square.

25
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,500
<i>The line will show the exact start
of Vatican territory</i>

26
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,400
and, at the same time,
make my men aware of it

27
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,400
<i>and prevent any of them -
any armed German soldiers -</i>

28
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
<i>from violating it.</i>

29
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I thank you for your consideration, Colonel.

30
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,300
And I can only hope that our relations
between the Church and your armed forces

31
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,700
will remain as reasonable.
Good day, gentlemen.

32
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,500
It's certainly a relief, Holy Father.
They seem prepared to act reasonably.

33
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,200
<i>He must have been very sure of my permission.</i>

34
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,400
Kappler is the one to watch, of course,

35
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,600
<i>with his white line.</i>

36
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,800
<i>It is not meant merely to keep his men out,</i>

37
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,000
<i>it is a reminder to us of our authority,
of how far we can go.</i>

38
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
Come on, lad, come on.
Don't be afraid to hit me.

39
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
Come on.

40
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,100
<i>That's it.</i>

41
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,000
<i>Sei bravo! Ancora, ancora!
Bene, bene.</i>

42
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,600
Watch it, now.

43
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,300
That's the boy.

44
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,500
E vai, e vai ancora, ancora!
Cosi, cosi! Ancora, dai!

45
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

46
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,900
Now, you've a trick of leaning to the left
when you're going to hook.

47
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
That's when you leave yourself open.

48
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,000
Try to remember that.

49
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>But this is the Vatican.
Just let us speak with someone.</i>

50
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,300
United States. Americano.

51
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,400
English. Tommy.

52
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,600
B-1 7.

53
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,200
Crashed. Bomber, bomber. Savvy?

54
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,900
<i>No. Via, via!</i>

55
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
I thought they had to give us shelter.

56
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,400
I thought they had to help anyone who asked.
- Bleedin' Eyeties.

57
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,200
There's no need to go running away.
- You speak English?

58
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,000
After a fashion. The name's O'Flaherty.

59
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
You lads look terrible.

60
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,500
<i>Could you do with a bite to eat
and a place to stay? Come on.</i>

61
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, I'd advise you to trust me

62
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,200
or you'll end up in Regina Coeli prison
by nightfall.

63
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,800
Now, come on. Follow me.
And don't be talking out loud in English.

64
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,100
In you go, now. No-one's going to stop you.

65
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,600
Third floor, room at the end of the passage.

66
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,400
I've a bit of business to see to
and I'll join you as soon as I can. In you go.

67
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,200
Excuse me, but er... what is this place?

68
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,100
No speaka da lingo.

69
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,200
It's some kind of hostel, isn't it?

70
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,600
It seems like it, but I'm not sure if it's...

71
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,500
Isn't Hugh here?

72
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,100
Hugh?
- Hugh O'Flaherty.

73
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,300
How silly of me. I can see he isn't.

74
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself.

75
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,600
I am Francesca. Francesca Lombardo.
And you?

76
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,700
I'm Lieutenant Manning, US Air Corps. This is
Corporal Tate, British 6th Armoured Division.

77
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,600
When were you captured?

78
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,900
My name is Lieutenant Jack Manning,
my number is 0-7-6-4...

79
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,700
If you're only going to repeat your name,
rank and number, Lieutenant,

80
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,800
the conversation
is going to be terribly one-sided.

81
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,500
I was picked up in North Africa, miss,
when Tobruk fell.

82
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,400
The lieutenant was shot down a few weeks ago.

83
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,500
We were in a camp south of here, and yesterday
the Germans shoved us all into cattle trucks.

84
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We didn't fancy a trip to the Third Reich
so we jumped off and stole some clothes.

85
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
I see.

86
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
And er... what about you? Are you Italian?

87
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,300
My late husband was Italian,
but I am from Malta.

88
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
So you could say I was British.

89
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,200
Well, well.

90
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,800
And now you just sort of... live here
with Mr O'Flaherty.

91
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,600
I don't actually live here...

92
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
but I call in quite often.

93
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,900
Where is he now?

94
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
In his office, I expect.

95
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,900
He's kept pretty busy.

96
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,200
Blimey.

97
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,400
You've had something to eat, have you? Good.

98
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,100
And you've met Mrs Lombardo.

99
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Well now, what are you doing in Rome?

100
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
The Vatican's neutral, right, sir?

101
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,500
That's what the chaps always said.
"If you get stuck, make for the Vatican. "

102
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,700
The trouble was so many people were given
sanctuary during the early days of the war

103
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,100
the Vatican was about to burst at the seams,
so the gates had to be shut.

104
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
What about this place?

105
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,100
This is a religious hostel on Vatican territory,
safe enough, for the moment.

106
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,500
Excuse me, sir. Are you some kind of bishop?

107
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,400
Not nearly that exalted, just a monsignor.

108
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,500
Come in.

109
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,300
<i>Ah, Vittorio.</i>

110
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,200
I've got what you wanted.
- That's the boy.

111
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,800
This is my old pal Father Vittorio.

112
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,000
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

113
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,700
Ah, that's just the ticket.

114
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Some decent clothes, spruce you up a bit.

115
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,700
Lieutenant Manning can wear one of mine.
- Where are you going to put them?

116
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,000
San Sepolcro?
- That's where I put that last lot.

117
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,400
<i>I've got the RAF bunch at Via Mazzini.</i>

118
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,200
<i>I think we'll try the Ursuline Convent.
- There's no more room at the convent,</i>

119
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,400
but I know where they can go.

120
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,200
Home with me.

121
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,400
Oh, no, you don't.

122
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,500
That's altogether too risky.

123
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,900
I'm not even going to consider it.

124
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,400
You're going to have to...
because I want to help.

125
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
And this time you're not going to put me off.

126
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,000
So that's the way it is, is it?

127
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,700
It is.

128
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,800
Well, all right.

129
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,500
Only for a couple of days.

130
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,000
My old tweed golf jacket. That'll do you fine.

131
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,500
It's a good thing you're pro-British, Father.

132
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,500
Holy Mother, that's the first time
I've ever been accused of that.

133
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Oh, Herbert...

134
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,100
it's... it's unbelievable.

135
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,700
Yes. Unbelievable as it is, it's real.

136
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,100
You know something, Minna?

137
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,800
It's mine.

138
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,800
And if you're nice to me, I'll give it to you.
- Pappi, Pappi!

139
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,500
Ah!

140
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Careful, Pappi, you'll mess my hair.
- You're your mother's daughter, Liesel.

141
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Whoop-pa.
- Look, look!

142
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,600
I'll tell you something, children.

143
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,700
When I was little more than a boy
I came here to this city.

144
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,900
I walked everywhere.

145
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,100
I saw every street and square.

146
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,900
And I fell in love...

147
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
.. with Rome.

148
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,700
<i>It's true.</i>

149
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,500
And I always promised myself that one day
I would come back to claim her.

150
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,400
What's that, Pappi?

151
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,700
<i>That's the Victor EmmanueI Monument.</i>

152
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,500
It looks like a wedding cake, huh?

153
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,700
And there, Liesel,

154
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,900
there is the Campidoglio,

155
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,100
where the Temple of Jupiter stood.

156
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,600
All the Roman emperors
used to celebrate their triumphs in war.

157
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,400
What's that, Pappi?

158
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
<i>St Peter's, at the Vatican.</i>

159
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
<i>Where's the Colosseum?</i>

160
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,800
You can't see it from here.
- Can we go there, Pappi?

161
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,100
Yes, I'll take you when I have time.

162
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,900
I want to go now.
- I told you, I'll take you there soon.

163
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,700
Maybe tomorrow.

164
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,600
We can go anywhere we like.

165
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,600
Rome is ours.

166
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,100
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?</i>

167
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,500
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?</i>

168
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,600
<i>Per Piazza Navona, dove si scende?</i>

169
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,800
<i>Scusi, dove si va per la Piazza Navona?
- La terza fermata, signora.</i>

170
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,000
<i>Grazie.
- Prego.</i>

171
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,400
Halt.

172
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,900
Documenti. Documenti.

173
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,500
<i>Andiamo, svegliati! Andiamo.</i>

174
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,700
<i>E voi?</i>

175
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,400
<i>Documento.</i>

176
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,400
Un altro.

177
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,400
Documenti.

178
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,700
<i>E voi?</i>

179
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,600
Documento.

180
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,500
<i>Documento.</i>

181
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,700
<i>Ancora.</i>

182
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,100
Documento.

183
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,600
This way, please.

184
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,600
Good evening, Monsignor.
- Good evening, Emilia.

185
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,000
You remember our friend Simon, don't you?
- Yes, you're the one who's at medical school.

186
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000
How's it all going?
- It was going well, Monsignor,

187
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
till the Germans came.

188
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,200
My family is Jewish.
They know what may happen.

189
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,100
This is my elder daughter Guila,

190
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,100
my other daughter Emilia
and our friend Simon Weiss.

191
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,300
These gentlemen are Allied soldiers.
They're going to stay with us for a while.

192
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,300
We're very grateful to you, Mrs Lombardo,
but we won't be here long.

193
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,800
We'll rest, then we'll head for the Allied lines.

194
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,900
There's not a chance, lad. The whole German
army's between you and your people in Salerno.

195
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,100
<i>In a couple of days I'll have you moved
somewhere more permanent.</i>

196
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,200
We'll see about that.
- Ah.

197
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,000
Come on, let's get things ready.

198
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
In the meantime, please don't worry.

199
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Things will be a bit crowded, but we'll manage.

200
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm sure we will.

201
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,900
It'll be like a rest-cure
after what we've been through, ma'am.

202
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,700
Don't get carried away, lads.

203
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,500
This isn't all fun and games, you know.

204
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,700
If there's any trouble, your duty is to get out fast.

205
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,300
Don't tell anyone where you've been hiding,
whatever happens.

206
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,200
If you're captured, you'll only be put in jail.

207
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,100
Mrs Lombardo and her daughters will be shot.

208
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,700
What is this?

209
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A report on known black market operators, sir.
- Yes. Next.

210
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,200
A report on the water and electricity supplies.
- Next.

211
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,000
A list of suspected members
of Resistance groups.

212
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,100
They must be kept under surveillance, Hirsch.

213
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,800
At the first sign of trouble, round them up.

214
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,000
What is the latest on those escaped prisoners?

215
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
A number have been picked up, sir. Er... 53.

216
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
Only 53?

217
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,200
Army intelligence
said hundreds were heading for Rome.

218
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,900
They cannot be here yet.

219
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,400
I don't accept that, Hirsch.

220
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
They must be finding places to hide
before we can arrest them.

221
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Most of the men picked up, sir,
were heading for the Vatican.

222
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,900
They seemed to think
they would be given shelter there.

223
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
I see.
- Up to a few months ago

224
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,900
a committee of the Holy Office
was in charge of welfare in the Italian camps.

225
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,500
What is it, this Holy Office?

226
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,400
It's the secret court of the Catholic Church, sir.

227
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,100
It used to be known as the Inquisition.

228
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,100
Indeed.

229
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,000
Now it handles all cases of divorce, heresy,
challenges to the faith, and so on.

230
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,200
And this committee?

231
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,700
A welfare group set up by the Pope.

232
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,800
But it was headed by...

233
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,900
Cardinal Crespini.

234
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,700
But it was largely run
by a man named O'Flaherty.

235
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,100
O'Flaherty. What is he?
- A monsignor, sir.

236
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,200
A high official in the Holy Office.
A sort of religious lawyer.

237
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,500
What else?
- There is no more information.

238
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,800
We could find out more about him,
his associates, people around him.

239
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,600
Yes, well, don't spend too much time on it.

240
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,700
Still, it might be useful, at least,
to know where he fits in...

241
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,500
.. this Monsignor O'Flaherty.

242
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,300
Coffee, Monsignor?

243
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,700
Well, I wouldn't say no.
That smells like the real article.

244
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,200
I believe it is. Mr West seems able
to maintain a regular supply...

245
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,000
though I'm careful not to ask how.

246
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,700
Well, now, Sir D'Arcy, let's get back to business.

247
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,700
Ah, yes, some 40 Allied escapers, you say?

248
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,100
They're mostly British.
A few Americans, some French.

249
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,500
I've been hiding them out in various colleges,
monasteries, a couple of private homes.

250
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,500
Well, that's very fine of you. A splendid effort.

251
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,500
Well, the point is,
there are going to be a lot more.

252
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Are you sure of that?

253
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
<i>Nothing could be more certain.
It's going to be a major problem.</i>

254
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,400
They've got to be housed, fed and clothed.

255
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,900
I've done all that I can on my own.
Now you'll have to take over.

256
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,300
But I cannot possibly become involved,
Monsignor.

257
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,200
I can't take any responsibility for it.

258
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,800
What are you saying to me, man?

259
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,600
In the name of God, you're the British minister.

260
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,600
But my dear man, I've been a prisoner here
in the Vatican since the beginning of the war.

261
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,600
This work of yours needs someone
who can move about.

262
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,500
<i>You must understand that,
as Minister to the Holy See,</i>

263
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,200
<i>my strictest duty is to do nothing which might
compromise the neutrality of the Vatican state</i>

264
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,500
<i>or of His Holiness the Pope.</i>

265
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,400
Though, naturally, this whole business
upsets me dreadfully.

266
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,800
I've had enough.

267
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,400
<i>Well, since most of them are British,
I naturally thought I should come here.</i>

268
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
If you'll pardon me.

269
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,200
I think I've taken up enough of your time.

270
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,600
Well, it was kind of you to call
and fill me in on the problem,

271
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,200
but, really, my butler - Mr West -

272
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,300
he knows more about what's going on than I do.

273
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,300
"Most kind of you. "

274
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
"Not my concern. "

275
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,600
"So dreadfully sorry. "

276
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,800
Come in.

277
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,600
<i>Mr West.</i>

278
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,000
Sorry to interrupt you at your work, sir.

279
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,200
You'd better be careful what you say.

280
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, I didn't think you looked happy
when you left us, sir.

281
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,200
Mm. Well, it may surprise you to learn
that I was born and raised in Ireland.

282
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,600
<i>During the Troubles
some of my closest friends in college</i>

283
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,100
were shot by the Black and Tans.

284
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,900
So I have my own opinion of the English

285
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,100
and it's just been beautifully confirmed.

286
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,100
Yes, I understand we're not too popular
in certain parts of Ireland, sir.

287
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,300
However,
the minister would like you to have this.

288
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,600
- 60,000 lire.
- Sir D'Arcy's sorry, sir.

289
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,500
It's all he can spare at the moment.

290
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,200
It's for food and clothes and stuff
for the escapers.

291
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,500
Oh, he's changed his tune, has he?
- Oh, Lord love you, sir!

292
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,700
Which I'm sure he does.
No, he meant what he said.

293
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,000
The Vatican's neutrality
is really most precarious.

294
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,800
The minister has to be very careful,
but he's keen to assist you in any way he can,

295
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,500
in secret.

296
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,200
I might have known.

297
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,300
I'll be frank with you.

298
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,400
I'm a bit hot-tempered.

299
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,200
Is that a fact, sir?
- One of my little character flaws.

300
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,500
Well...

301
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
I'll admit that this money is a great relief.

302
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,100
Food and all the rest of it, as you well know,
are getting scarce and expensive.

303
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,000
That's where Sir D'Arcy
thought I might come in handy, sir.

304
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,700
I've managed to keep up some contacts.
I've got one or two... friends in the black market.

305
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,100
Have a chair.
- Oh. Thank you very much, sir.

306
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,200
The big problem, if there's to be
as many escapers as you expect,

307
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,200
will be finding Italian civilians
willing to hide them.

308
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,900
Provided you intend to carry on with the job, sir.

309
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,100
That's another thing.
That's the reason I went to see your boss.

310
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,000
If someone doesn't do something quick, all those
people are going to be in mortal danger.

311
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,800
That's right, sir.

312
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,700
Well, I've got a few friends I could call on.

313
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,100
So have I.
- Meanwhile...

314
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,200
you and I could start organising things.
- In what way, sir?

315
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,900
Mr West...

316
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,700
.. how'd you like to go into
the real estate business?

317
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,400
<i>Mi piace molto. Lo prendo. Grazie, signora.</i>

318
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,400
Fine. We'll take it. This is the best yet.
- Certainly the most expensive.

319
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,000
And the safest.
They'd never think of looking here.

320
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,100
Right. Just round the corner
from Gestapo headquarters.

321
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,300
<i>What do you mean you're not going to let us in?</i>

322
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:37,000
<i>Dove... iI ufficizio?</i>

323
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,800
Isn't there someone we can talk to?

324
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,000
Lieutenant Barnett, sir. Royal Tank Corps.

325
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Holy Mother of God, Lieutenant.
This is St Peter's Square not a parade ground.

326
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,900
Sorry, sir. I understand you can help us.
- Well, I might.

327
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,100
Now, we're not changing the guard
at Buckingham Palace.

328
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,000
Can you just walk along behind us
like normal people?

329
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,000
Try not to get used to it, lads.

330
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,000
This is our safest house.
Keep it for emergencies.

331
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,700
In a day or two you'll be moved
somewhere a little less elegant.

332
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,500
Born in Ireland, sir, of peasant stock.

333
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,100
Late entry into the Jesuit college, where
he was known for his anti-British sentiments.

334
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,800
Is that so?

335
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,600
Appointed Vice-Rector of Propaganda
at the college here in Rome at the age of 28.

336
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Then Vatican Charge d'Affaires in Egypt.

337
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,100
He'd been transferred to the diplomatic service?

338
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,900
Yes, sir.
- Well, well.

339
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,300
A resourceful man.

340
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,500
<i>What is this note - "Czechoslovakia 1 936"?</i>

341
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,600
Er... I don't know, sir.

342
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Where did the information come from?

343
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Er... from Beck, sir, of the secret police.
He is outside.

344
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,900
So, bring him in.

345
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
<i>Explain this note for me -
"Czechoslovakia 1 936".</i>

346
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,100
That is when O'Flaherty was sent there, sir.

347
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,300
The purpose of his mission
has never been discovered.

348
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,700
But in '38, when he returned to Rome
to join the Holy Office,

349
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,700
several of the people
whom he was associated with,

350
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,100
and whom the Gestapo wanted to interview,
disappeared.

351
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,200
He helped them to escape?

352
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,800
Nothing is certain -
only that he was connected with them.

353
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,800
I have put him under surveillance,
as you ordered.

354
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,600
<i>But my men can only follow him
once he crosses the white line.</i>

355
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
<i>So far they have nothing of interest to report.</i>

356
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,600
But I am interested, Beck. Very interested.

357
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,100
<i>Keep watching him. Anything more
you can learn, I want to know at once.</i>

358
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,800
At your orders, Colonel.

359
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,500
Black market prices are rising, Monsignor,
almost every day. It's supply and demand.

360
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,600
We'll need at least 200 lire a week
for each escaper.

361
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,900
We'll have to pass the hat round again.
Mine's the largest so we'll leave that to me.

362
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
Yes, Reverend Mother?

363
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,000
Clothes, Monsignor.
We need boots and shoes.

364
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,900
And many of the men are seriously ill.
They need treatment.

365
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,400
Father Morosini, your department.

366
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,900
The hospital of Santa Croce is in my parish.

367
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,100
The pharmacist promised us
whatever medical supplies he can spare.

368
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,600
First-rate. Anything else?

369
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,400
<i>If I could make a suggestion, sir.</i>

370
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,000
We've got a lot of men here, trained men.

371
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,200
Are they just going to sit around?

372
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,600
No, we can use them for sabotage
or cutting lines of communications

373
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,400
<i>or setting explosives.</i>

374
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,600
An army without guns?

375
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,500
Half of them wounded, half starving?

376
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,400
All over Rome,
partisan groups are being formed.

377
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,300
Father, if that's what you want,
then join one of them.

378
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,300
We're not a Resistance group.

379
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,900
<i>We're not here to blow up trains.
- But...</i>

380
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,400
Let me say it once and for all.

381
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,300
As priests it's our duty to do all we can
to help those in danger, the victims of the war.

382
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,300
We're not here to add to the killing.

383
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,700
Forgive me, Monsignor.

384
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,300
Now... back to business.

385
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,900
Count Langenthal, you're talking about spare
rooms, well, they're getting scarcer and scarcer,

386
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,500
<i>but we managed to dig up a few.
- Good.</i>

387
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,700
You have no idea how many escapers
come to me at the Swiss consulate,

388
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
but I have to be able to tell them where to go.

389
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,200
Well, I've been thinking about that.

390
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,800
I want you all to pass the word.

391
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,000
I'll be near the steps of St Peter's,
if anyone needs me,

392
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,400
every afternoon from three till five.

393
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,000
That might be a bit dodgy, sir.
You'll be setting yourself up as a target.

394
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,100
Oh, don't worry, my boy.

395
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,700
I'll only be a target for the pigeons.

396
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,400
Ah, Rabbi Leoni.

397
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,200
Good afternoon, gentlemen. Buona sera.

398
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,900
Relax, gentlemen, relax.

399
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,300
You will have noticed how few Jews
have been bothered...

400
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,900
.. and not one single piece of Jewish property
has been damaged...

401
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,600
.. since the SS took control in Rome.

402
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,700
You and your families are quite safe.

403
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,600
Please understand, Colonel,
we have heard stories... rumours.

404
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,600
Allied propaganda, I suspect.

405
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,800
But I promise you
that there will be no ill-treatment,

406
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,400
no deportations to forced labour
or so-called death camps.

407
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,500
You can take it from me
these camps do not exist.

408
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:13,000
You and your families will be treated
exactly the same way as any other Italian.

409
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Thank you, Colonel.
You have spoken frankly, so must I.

410
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,600
These are words we never expected to hear.

411
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,400
There is one small point, however.

412
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,700
I have shown you my good faith.

413
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:36,000
To show yours, I must ask the Jewish community
to pay an indemnity of one million lire

414
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,600
and one hundred pounds in pure gold.

415
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,900
<i>This must be delivered to this office
within 36 hours or...</i>

416
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm afraid I may not be able
to keep my guarantees.

417
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,100
Such an amount of gold is impossible to raise
in such a short time.

418
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,100
<i>ColoneI, I beg you, please give us a little longer.</i>

419
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,200
I'm sorry.

420
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,900
36 hours.

421
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,800
Starting now.

422
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,100
A hundred pounds of gold?

423
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,600
The elders say we have to trust Kappler.

424
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,900
They say that somehow
we must try to raise the full amount.

425
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,000
This Colonel Kappler, he gave his word, did he?

426
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,600
Like he told them
there are no extermination camps.

427
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,800
Hold on, Simon. Just hold on.
I've got a lot of friends. They've got friends.

428
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,300
<i>You tell Dr Leoni we'll all pitch in
and do what we can. Here.</i>

429
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,800
It doesn't weigh much... but it's a start for you.

430
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,400
Well?

431
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Exactly one hundred pounds, sir.

432
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,400
Exactly?
- To the ounce, Colonel.

433
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,900
Thank you, Doctor.

434
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,700
Typical! They swore they had no gold, but they
could find it quickly enough when they had to.

435
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,000
So it seems.

436
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,900
And now they're going out free.
We should have asked for twice as much.

437
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,800
You're too greedy, Hirsch.

438
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,400
I didn't want to make it impossible for them.

439
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,700
Sir?
- If we had raided their ghetto,

440
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
how long would it have taken us
and how much would we have found?

441
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,800
At best, less than half.

442
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,400
Let them do our work for us.

443
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,300
My arm is killing me.

444
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,200
You shouldn't have got your tank
shot out from under you.

445
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,400
I thought you said this was a short cut.

446
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,400
So it is.
We'll cut through the old ghetto just up ahead.

447
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,300
Could we slow down, just a little?
- Not on your life, Lieutenant.

448
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,700
That's Regina Coeli prison, where you'll wind up
if you tangle with one of the German patrols.

449
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,500
Those look like Italians on guard, Father.

450
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,700
So they are, poor devils.
Working for the Gestapo now.

451
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,000
We're trying to arrange for some
artistic reproductions of Vatican passes.

452
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,300
Good as the real thing.

453
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,500
Even with them
you're going to have to watch your step.

454
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000
<i>Quick, the both of you, split up.
Remember the address - Via Grazzini 21.</i>

455
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,800
Hierher!

456
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,400
Rein!

457
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,400
You. If you are wise, stay out of it.

458
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,200
Why are you doing this?
- We need more people in the work camps.

459
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,300
<i>These have been chosen.
The chosen people.</i>

460
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,100
But their security was guaranteed.

461
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,000
They paid for it.

462
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,500
Who gave these orders?

463
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,200
Colonel Kappler. Take it up with him.

464
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,100
Kappler.

465
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Then you make a wish...

466
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,800
.. and you... you throw them in...

467
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,000
Ah.
-.. and your wish will come true.

468
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Mamma says if you throw in a coin,
it means one day you will come back to Rome.

469
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,000
That's a wish that's bound to be granted

470
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,800
because we're never going to leave.

471
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,400
Gregorian chant

472
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,800
Baroque flute

473
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,500
After all the trouble I'd taken to land on a bunker,

474
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,100
the Bishop hit his ball a mighty swipe
and it disappeared.

475
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,200
It wasn't on the fairway,
it wasn't in the rough.

476
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,700
Where was it?
- It had ricocheted off a tree, hit the fence

477
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,200
and bounced into the back of an open truck,
which took it all the way to Genoa.

478
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,000
It was the longest drive in history.

479
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:31,200
Good evening, Count Langenthal.
- Monsignor.

480
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,700
I am always sure to meet you
at Prince Mateo's parties.

481
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,000
I er... have another six packages
arriving tomorrow. Where can I put them?

482
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,000
<i>Six more? That'd be at 63 Via Rienzi
and the apartment in Piazza Lucca.</i>

483
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Tres bien.

484
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,700
You're socialising with the Swiss consul,
I see, Monsignor.

485
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,200
One meets all the best people at your parties,
Prince Mateo.

486
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,800
And at least four of them
hiding escaped prisoners.

487
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,800
Don't worry, I won't say anything.

488
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,700
I know you are interested in paintings
of the Roman school.

489
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,400
I have one you haven't seen before.

490
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,500
I'd appreciate your opinion of it. Please...

491
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,300
You don't deny what I said.

492
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,500
You seem very well informed.

493
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,700
I have known of your work for some time
and I am ashamed to have done nothing.

494
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,800
I believe you're short of money.

495
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,700
That's a slight understatement. We're flat broke.

496
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,900
It is risky to draw out large amounts too often.

497
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,100
Here are 300,000 lire.

498
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll give you more as soon as I can.

499
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,500
I want to give you... some warning.

500
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,800
Warning? What about?

501
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,900
Yes, I hear things.

502
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,400
For instance, the Gestapo is watching you.

503
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,200
Are they, now?
Well, that'll keep them out of trouble.

504
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,000
Don't take it so lightly, my friend.

505
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,500
Herbert Kappler
is an extremely dangerous man.

506
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,100
<i>He's seen at all the most fashionable
restaurants, at all the best parties.</i>

507
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,900
<i>He is as much a playboy as a priest.</i>

508
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,100
Perhaps.

509
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:58,400
Beck, have you learnt anything more?

510
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,800
We heard he helped organise
a gold collection for the Jews.

511
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,800
<i>Shall we pick him up?</i>

512
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,000
No.

513
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,400
We could always sweat a confession out of him,
Colonel.

514
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,000
It's a delicate situation, Beck.

515
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,800
It calls for kid gloves,
not your rubber truncheon.

516
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,800
Monsignor O'Flaherty
is an important Vatican official...

517
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,200
.. a protege of the Pope.
We cannot touch him without proof.

518
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,700
People must help him,
does that go for them too?

519
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,900
It does not!

520
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,400
It's time these Italians were taught a lesson.

521
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,700
I want checkpoints at every major street,

522
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,800
and random checks on identity papers
throughout the city

523
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,100
and a curfew starting tonight.
- Sir.

524
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,500
No-one to go out after dark without permission,
anyone without a permit to be arrested

525
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,200
and anyone who does not stop for questioning
to be shot on sight!

526
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,600
And I want guards...

527
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,300
on that white line.

528
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
Until these people learn who their friends are...

529
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,400
.. we'll bring the shutters down on Rome.

530
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,000
Ah, Monsignor O'Flaherty.

531
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:26,700
I am told that for the first time in living memory
our work at the Holy Office is nearly up to date.

532
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,200
We're getting there, Your Holiness,
slowly but surely.

533
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,900
Walk with me, my son.

534
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,900
Our work here is never easy, but the war
has made it infinitely more complicated.

535
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,300
Every day the white line
becomes more like a prison wall.

536
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,000
Every day we become more aware
of all the suffering outside.

537
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,100
So many calls for help.
- One does what one can, Holy Father.

538
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,500
Each of my priests
must do as his conscience tells him.

539
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:02,600
I only ask that whatever action is taken,
it does not affect Vatican neutrality.

540
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,000
<i>However,</i>

541
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,500
although officially
I am unaware of my priests' activities,

542
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,300
it also means that there is very little that I can do
to save any of them... if they are caught.

543
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,000
<i>We are going to need more food.</i>

544
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,200
<i>This will mean moving about more.</i>

545
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,400
<i>I was wondering
if we could use neutraI passports.</i>

546
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,600
Well, we have a few Swiss and Spanish
for emergencies

547
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,300
but to get more, even good forgeries,
is almost impossible.

548
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,600
I think you'll have to rely on
the Vatican passes for now.

549
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,100
Francesca, we were that worried about you.

550
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,200
Sorry I'm late.

551
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,300
German patrols stopped me twice.

552
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,200
I thought I'd never get here.

553
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,600
Well, we've not time to recap, I'm afraid.

554
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:10,700
It's almost time for Kappler's unholy curfew.
Jack will fill you in later.

555
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:18,400
We're now looking after over 1,700 escapers,
1,726 to be exact.

556
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,300
<i>That means tighter security.</i>

557
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,500
From now on, when we contact each other
it'll be through code names.

558
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,400
Go ahead, Harry.

559
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:31,100
Nothing elaborate. The simpler a code name,
the easier it is to remember,

560
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,900
<i>and hopefully the harder for the enemy to break.</i>

561
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:38,100
Now, Francesca... you'll be Malta.

562
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:41,700
The Monsignor... will be Golf.

563
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,500
Father Vittorio will be Vicky;

564
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,800
<i>Mr West-Jeeves;</i>

565
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,200
<i>Count LangenthaI - Edelweiss;</i>

566
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,900
<i>Simon - Doc</i>

567
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,300
<i>and Father Morosini - Boots.</i>

568
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,100
I'll be Tommy
and Lieutenant Manning will be Joe.

569
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,500
And what is my code name?

570
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,000
We thought we'd call you Big Mamma.

571
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,200
And now we're going to have to break up
before sunset.

572
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,700
And we have to run and hide in our own city.

573
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,300
When my parish people need a priest after dark,
I cannot even go to them.

574
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:24,100
At the moment the Germans
are making the rules, Father,

575
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,100
but we can be thinking up one or two ways
to twist them around.

576
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,900
<i>.. Zimmers durchsuchen...</i>

577
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,000
Albero di vero.

578
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,200
E.
- E vero.

579
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,300
<i>Gli alberi sono veri.</i>

580
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,000
<i>Very good.</i>

581
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,700
It's all right.

582
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,500
I'll get it.
- No, Emilia will go.

583
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,100
Yes, Mamma.

584
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,900
Emilia, quickly, is your mother there?
Hurry! Hurry!

585
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,000
You have little time.
A German patrol is in the next street.

586
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,300
<i>You'll have to get your men out.
- Clear away the mattresses.</i>

587
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,500
We'll do that. Just collect your things.

588
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:33,000
Take them to St Monica's Convent. Via Luccini.
- Good luck, ma'am.

589
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,600
Emilia, set the table.
- Come on, hurry.

590
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,100
Don't be frightened, you're a brave girl.

591
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:43,500
Help me put the mattresses on the beds, then
clear up everything you see lying around. Hurry!

592
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,400
Los! Wo jede wohnen.

593
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,700
Schnell! Die Treppe auf!

594
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,100
Schnell! Aufmachen!

595
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,200
<i>Schnell.</i>

596
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,400
Quickly, quickly.

597
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,500
<i>Aufmachen!</i>

598
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,200
Stand aside. Search the rooms.

599
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,600
<i>My daughters.</i>

600
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:13,300
Anything?
- Nothing, sir.

601
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,000
May I ask what you are looking for?

602
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,600
Escaped prisoners and deserters.

603
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,100
Who else lives here?

604
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,500
There is only the three of us.

605
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,100
Hm.

606
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,400
Nebenan.

607
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,900
At nine you are seeing Father Gatti.

608
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,700
9:30 - you review the evidence
in the Di Stefano divorce.

609
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,100
They're still battling, are they?

610
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,400
Sorry. If I am interrupting...

611
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,400
Oh, Vittorio, it's all right. Come on in.
We'll finish that off later.

612
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,400
If Father Gatti arrives, ask him to wait, please.
Sit down, Vittorio.

613
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,600
How do you get through it all?

614
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,000
I once worked on a farm. It's just the same -
you start early and you stay late.

615
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,200
I've been hearing some gossip, Hugh.
It's worrying.

616
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,700
And if you wouldn't listen to it,
you wouldn't be worried.

617
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,100
There are people here in the Vatican
who are jealous of your success.

618
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,200
Ah, who'd be jealous of a monsignor?

619
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,300
You have enemies, Hugh.

620
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,000
At the Vatican?
Why would I have enemies here?

621
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:01,000
They say your work for the escaped prisoners
proves you are unorthodox.

622
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,200
Vittorio, I'm not going to start worrying
about politics.

623
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,400
You must think about your future.
- Listen to this.

624
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,400
Colonel Herbert Kappler,
born Halberstadt, Germany. Son of a doctor.

625
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Personally recruited into the SS
by Reinhard Heydrich.

626
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,200
1 938, organised deportation of Austrian Jews
to concentration camps.

627
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,100
<i>Transferred to Belgium,
where he put down an insurrection in Brussels</i>

628
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,300
<i>with many reported atrocities.</i>

629
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:36,200
Add to that, in the last six months
he's supervised the deportation of Roman Jews,

630
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:40,200
he's organised mass round-ups of people
for slave labour

631
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,800
<i>and personally ordered the torture
of hundreds of civilians.</i>

632
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Talk about my career,
my little enemies in the Vatican...

633
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,600
.. here's the real enemy.

634
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,700
Padre!
- What is it, Harry?

635
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,600
There's bad news. Father Morosini
has been arrested at one of the checkpoints.

636
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,900
Arrested? Why?

637
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,600
He was carrying a gun, sir.
He's been taken to Gestapo headquarters.

638
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,800
As well as helping us, he's been working
for the Resistance, as a courier.

639
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,700
I should have known he'd do something like that.

640
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,000
Where was he picked up?

641
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,800
Via Alighieri. Mrs Lombardo's sector.

642
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,800
You'd better warn her immediately.

643
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,900
And all of our people in that area.

644
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,200
Start moving as many as you can
to other sectors.

645
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,000
They won't force him to talk.

646
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,600
I mean, they wouldn't torture a priest.

647
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,500
Get moving, Harry. Get moving.

648
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,600
Hold him.

649
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:23,100
Anything?
- Not yet.

650
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,900
Remember me?

651
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,400
Do you know who I am?

652
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,200
I admire your courage, Father.

653
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,300
But please understand you possess information
that we must have.

654
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,500
I have...

655
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,200
no information.

656
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,800
For the good of your country...

657
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,900
please...

658
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,600
help me to put an end to the violence.

659
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,400
You're a priest.

660
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,000
Surely you want that, too?

661
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,000
I have... no information.

662
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,400
I won't even let you become a martyr, Father.

663
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,900
I will have you taken to Regina Coeli

664
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,600
to be shot by your own countrymen.

665
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,700
<i>Surely you see it's pointless
to go through all this,</i>

666
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,200
when all you have to do
is to give us a few names...

667
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,000
.. and it's over.

668
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,700
Very well.

669
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,200
Get on with it.

670
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,400
<i>Monsignor.</i>

671
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,100
Is there any word?

672
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,600
Only that Father Morosini refused...

673
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,200
.. and still refuses to name anyone.

674
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,700
<i>They've taken him to Regina Coeli prison.</i>

675
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,200
And have you found out
what's to be done with him?

676
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,500
The Holy Father broke his rule,

677
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,400
and appealed to the German High Command
for a pardon.

678
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,100
<i>They said they could not interfere.</i>

679
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,800
The decision to execute him or not
lies with the SS Commandant.

680
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,600
Kappler!

681
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,800
My countrymen...

682
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,800
.. I die for love of our country...

683
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,300
<i>.. to which and to God,</i>

684
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,000
<i>I dedicate my last thoughts.</i>

685
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,700
Viva Italia.

686
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,300
I forgive you.

687
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,300
Firing party,

688
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,000
<i>present!</i>

689
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,900
<i>Aim!</i>

690
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,600
<i>Fire!</i>

691
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,100
Shoot him!

692
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,800
He is a priest!

693
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,700
Hallelujah

694
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,700
And I got the loveliest blue dress.

695
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,400
Sort of off the shoulders.
Not really very expensive.

696
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,300
I shall wear it for New Year's Eve.

697
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,900
<i>And a suit for Franz,
and a pretty little party dress for Liesel.</i>

698
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,100
Mutti, can we open our presents?

699
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,800
Of course. Why not?

700
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:36,200
<i>And then we had lunch at a wonderful restaurant
at Piazza Navona.</i>

701
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,900
Oh, Herbert, it's so beautiful.
We have to eat there together.

702
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,200
Herbert?
- Hm?

703
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,900
You're not listening.

704
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:46,900
Of course I was.

705
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,100
You look very tired.

706
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,200
Is there something wrong?

707
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:54,800
Oh, nothing special.
It's... the usual problems, that's all.

708
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,300
<i>Oh, it's Italian!</i>

709
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,400
I wanted a Bavarian doll! I told you!

710
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,300
Look, Pappi!

711
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,800
Oh, Herbert!
Don't they see enough guns everywhere?

712
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,200
That's what he wanted.

713
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,900
And it's good for him to get used to them.

714
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,600
This world we live in.

715
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,500
Happy Christmas.

716
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,900
Can you believe it, gentlemen?

717
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,700
<i>One week ago,
the Americans and British landed at Anzio</i>

718
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,400
only 30 miles southwest of Rome,

719
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,800
and not a single German
between them and the city.

720
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:34,300
And then, for some reason,
some unfathomable reason, they didn't advance.

721
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:37,300
And the time they wasted digging themselves in,

722
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,900
was enough for us to bring up tanks and artillery.

723
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:45,400
And now we've closed the gap
with two army corps,

724
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,700
and the mortars,
and dive bombers on them night and day.

725
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,700
<i>The Fuhrer must hear about this.</i>

726
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,800
There you have it, gentlemen.

727
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,500
<i>The Anzio beachhead has been contained.</i>

728
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,200
Rome is as safe as ever.

729
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,200
Even more so, General. The landing brought out
many partisans in the streets,

730
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:14,600
so we were able to round them up.

731
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,800
Very good.

732
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:22,700
But I also hear that there are large numbers
of enemy prisoners among them, Colonel.

733
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,600
That suggests that...

734
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:29,100
.. even in Rome
there were more than we suspected.

735
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,900
Many have been rounded up, sir.

736
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,300
Soon I shall be in a position to arrest the others.

737
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,400
I'm relieved to hear that.

738
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:42,000
Reichsfuhrer Himmler himself has asked me
what is being done about them.

739
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,300
I am fairly certain that um...

740
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,600
this organisation
which is helping these prisoners...

741
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,400
.. is being run by one man.

742
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,200
A priest.

743
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,200
Then deal with him. Deal with him quickly.

744
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:58,600
The Reichsfuhrer doesn't deal in supposition,
he wants results.

745
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,900
Well, that's the last department checked.
Come on, let's go home.

746
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,100
Do we have to go right away?

747
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,300
Your mother would kill me
if she knew I'd taken you with me.

748
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,100
We never get a chance to be alone.

749
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:32,500
OK.

750
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,200
We'll take the long way home. Hm?

751
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,300
Ah, thank you, Commander Tore. Thank you.

752
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,200
Thank you for looking after our friends.

753
01:08:06,300 --> 01:08:08,800
Ah, good evening, Count.
- Monsignor.

754
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,700
Are you enjoying the opera, Mrs Lombardo?
- Very much. Thank you, Count Langenthal.

755
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,800
It's nice to be reminded
of what life used to be like.

756
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:22,000
Could our friends in Trastevere possibly
entertain a few more visiting monks

757
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,900
if I were to send them round tomorrow?

758
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,600
Yes, I think we could manage that, Monsignor.

759
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,100
Well, shall we be getting back
for another dose of Puccini?

760
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,100
<i>Next.</i>

761
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,600
<i>Do you work for the Vatican?</i>

762
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,500
Yes, er... Civilian Records Office.

763
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,900
Nationality?
- Irish.

764
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,500
Passport, please.

765
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:56,200
Uh, I don't carry it with me.
- Wait over there, please.

766
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,800
I don't understand. This has never been...
- Colonel Kappler's orders.

767
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,800
Vatican passes are no longer valid on their own.

768
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,600
Next!

769
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,100
<i>Documenti!</i>

770
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:12,400
<i>Dai, passi.</i>

771
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:15,100
<i>Avanti!</i>

772
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:21,100
<i>Documenti!</i>

773
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,600
Was machst du da?

774
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,500
Portalo via.

775
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,900
PUCCINl: La Boheme

776
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,800
<i>Bravo!</i>

777
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,400
<i>Bravo!</i>

778
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:36,000
What will they do?
- Nothing till the morning.

779
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,500
They'll check out his name
with the Irish embassy.

780
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,000
It's a false name on the pass! They'll find out!
- Don't take on so, lass.

781
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,300
We're going to think of something. Come along.

782
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,100
Do you see something, darling?

783
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:50,500
Yes. Someone I very much want to meet.

784
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,200
Francesca.
- What is it?

785
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,200
It's Kappler.
I've half an idea he wants a word with me.

786
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,800
You and Guila run along now with the Count.

787
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,500
Go straight home, mind. Off you go.

788
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,300
I don't believe we've met.

789
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:16,900
I'm sure I would have remembered, Colonel.

790
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,700
My dear, this is Monsignor O'Flaherty
of the Holy Office. My wife.

791
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:23,300
Monsignor.
- Good evening, Mrs Kappler.

792
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:27,100
The Holy Office. Is that part of your church?
- We like to think so.

793
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,400
My aide, Captain Hirsch.
- Captain.

794
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,900
Well, I'm delighted to meet you at last, Colonel.

795
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:35,000
I've heard so much about you.

796
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,700
And I of you.

797
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,600
Did you enjoy the opera, Monsignor?

798
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,100
Enormously. Puccini's my favourite.

799
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,600
Ah! So, we have something in common.

800
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,100
Perhaps we can discuss it one day,
among other things.

801
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,600
That would be delightful.

802
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,900
I hope you will be my guest, in fact,
in the near future.

803
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:56,400
That would depend on how long
you're going to stay in Rome.

804
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,100
I intend to be here for a very long time.

805
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,900
O'Flaherty? That's Irish, isn't it?

806
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:06,500
Indeed it is, ma'am. As Irish as McGinty's goat.

807
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,200
From the land of saints and scholars
and leprechauns.

808
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,400
It's a very primitive country, I believe.

809
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,600
I doubt, Hirsch,
if the Monsignor would agree with you.

810
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,800
He will tell us it is a modern democracy now.

811
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:25,100
And that's a fact, Colonel. With an elected prime
minister, parliament, religious freedom as well.

812
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,000
It's a system I'd recommend to you.

813
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:34,300
Well, I mustn't hold you up any longer.

814
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,200
It's a rare pleasure.
We shall meet again, I promise.

815
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:40,400
In the case we don't,

816
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,600
I wonder if I might have a little memento
of this evening?

817
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,300
Would it be asking too much
for you to sign my programme?

818
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,400
Oh!

819
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,000
Why not?

820
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,400
Ah, you're kindness itself.

821
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:05,200
It's been a great privilege to have met with you,
Mrs Kappler, Captain Hirsch.

822
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,800
Very charming man, isn't he?

823
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,400
Indeed.

824
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:15,700
Too bad we didn't meet the lady he was with.
She was lovely.

825
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,400
Yes, I would have liked to have met her, too.

826
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,300
Find her.
- Ja.

827
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,500
Malta, Tommy, Golf,

828
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:29,000
Vicky.

829
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,100
<i>Where did you get this?
- From a man we picked up last night.</i>

830
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:35,400
What did they do with him?
- He was taken to the Regina Coeli

831
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,600
until his identity could be checked.

832
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,300
I've asked Beck to bring him here.

833
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,300
We are the idiots, Hirsch!

834
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:47,000
Sir?

835
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:52,000
With all our technology, all our experts,
we expect something complicated.

836
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:56,200
But suppose this is something
really very simple?

837
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,400
So simple, in fact,

838
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,500
it is actually quite clever.

839
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,300
V for Via, for instance.

840
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,500
A street.

841
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,400
And the numbers would be house numbers.
- Yes, perhaps.

842
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:12,000
And the second set?
- Number of escapers.

843
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,300
Yes.

844
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,400
Well, the man they picked up
will tell us if I'm right.

845
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:21,100
It shouldn't be too difficult to work out on a map
exactly what areas these numbers represent.

846
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:24,000
Yes?

847
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,500
That man you wanted?
- Yes? Well, bring him in.

848
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,300
He was released first thing this morning.

849
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,800
<i>What do you mean released?
- From the prison.</i>

850
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,700
They had an order... for his release
signed by you.

851
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,800
That's ridiculous! I never signed anything!

852
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,900
It looks like your signature, Colonel.

853
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,600
<i>Golf.</i>

854
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,800
Come on, Harry.

855
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,400
Komm her!

856
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,300
We're going to need more champagne.
- Ja.

857
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,900
A night to celebrate, sir.
- Indeed it is, Hirsch.

858
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,900
A most successful operation.
- Are you certain, Herbert?

859
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:10,400
Inevitably. With a little persuasion,
the prisoners of war we have

860
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,200
will tell us who the others are, and they in turn
will lead us to more men, other hiding places.

861
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,600
And like ripples in the pond...
- Exactly.

862
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:23,100
With great pleasure,
I shall invite Monsignor Golf to visit us.

863
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:26,700
Well done, Herbert.

864
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:29,800
I will send a cable at once
to Reichsfuhrer Himmler.

865
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,400
Thank you, General.

866
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:34,100
A clean sweep, gentlemen!
- Prost!

867
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,400
Harry Barnett?

868
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,300
Yeah, Paddy was out the window when
he heard the shots, but he's sure Harry's dead.

869
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:50,000
<i>Now they've got his code book as well as mine.
I'll have to warn the others.</i>

870
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:53,300
Wait a minute, Jack. You're in the Vatican,
you've got to stay here.

871
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,100
Outside, you'd be a marked man.
- Forget it, Jack.

872
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,400
They've already rounded up 65 of your people.

873
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,300
We've got to move the rest
to the ones in Barnett's sector.

874
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,500
If you save one, you've got to save them all.

875
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:07,100
It's not possible! We've thousands
of escapers on the books at the moment.

876
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,600
Plus all the Italian civilians hiding them.

877
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:13,900
Monsignor, unless you can pull off a miracle,
this whole thing's finished.

878
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:15,800
Oh, no.

879
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,800
Kappler's won a few rounds.

880
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,000
He's not yet won the fight.

881
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,600
Now, we don't know when or where
the Gestapo will strike next.

882
01:17:23,900 --> 01:17:25,800
Everyone's in danger.

883
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,000
What we've got to do,

884
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:32,200
<i>is to move our people, all of them,
to safe places immediately.</i>

885
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,400
That's going to be some operation.

886
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,900
How do we set it up?

887
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,500
Well, we can count on all our Italian friends.

888
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,100
They're not going to let Kappler win out.

889
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,300
Now, let's get started.

890
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,400
There's a great deal to be done.

891
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,000
Precious little time.

892
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,000
I don't think we can do it in time, sir.

893
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:52,300
We'll give it a try, lad. And remember,

894
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,700
if we bring this off, it'll be something
you can tell to your grandchildren.

895
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:41,800
Nothing!

896
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,000
Every apartment empty!

897
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:48,300
In some, coffeepots still hot, fires burning,
food on the table. Nothing!

898
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,500
How did they all get away?

899
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,600
He did it.

900
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,300
That damned priest.

901
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,600
Sir!

902
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:04,400
This is the caretaker.

903
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:06,100
<i>What can he tell us?
- Go on.</i>

904
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,300
Tell him.

905
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,400
It was him.

906
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,600
<i>He wasn't dressed like a priest,</i>

907
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,900
but this is the man who rented the apartment.

908
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:18,100
<i>I will pick him up immediately.</i>

909
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,200
I wish it was so easy.

910
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:24,300
What do you mean, sir?
- He is still protected by the Vatican.

911
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,600
I will have to go in

912
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,300
and ask for him.

913
01:19:29,900 --> 01:19:32,400
Hat in hand!

914
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,200
<i>We have respected Vatican territory,</i>

915
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:59,300
but it has been violated again and again!

916
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:03,000
Then I suggest you make your report
to your authorities, Colonel.

917
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,300
I am the authority in Rome.

918
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,700
And I tell you that an illegal organisation exists
which is hiding prisoners of war,

919
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,500
<i>and is being directed by one of your staff.</i>

920
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:16,800
I want to question him.
- I regret that will not be possible.

921
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:20,400
You know who I'm talking about.

922
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:22,900
Monsignor O'Flaherty of the Holy Office.

923
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,200
He has charges to answer.

924
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:28,700
I'm afraid I cannot give my permission.

925
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,700
I ask only out of courtesy.

926
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,800
I intend to question him now.

927
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,000
I know your methods of questioning, Colonel.

928
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,000
Even of priests.

929
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,100
<i>May I remind you where you are.</i>

930
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:49,500
<i>That all my officials here
have diplomatic immunity.</i>

931
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,300
There is nothing more to be said.

932
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,900
If you wish to create an incident here,
Colonel Kappler...

933
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,700
.. please continue.

934
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,100
Kappler.

935
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,800
Yes, Herr General.

936
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:37,900
He's here? In Rome?

937
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:42,800
Yes. Yes, of course. At once.

938
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,100
Is something wrong?
- No, no, no, nothing.

939
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,800
But Herbert, it's five o'clock in the morning.
Will you please tell me what's going on?

940
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:54,600
I told you, nothing. Now, go back to sleep.

941
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:33,000
General,
Reichsfuhrer Himmler is waiting for you.

942
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:37,700
I won't forget you said
the whole thing was taken care of.

943
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,600
Why has he come to Italy?

944
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:43,500
Because whatever happens in Rome
is likely to affect the whole Italian campaign.

945
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,300
I wish I hadn't sent that cable.
Best to let sleeping dogs lie.

946
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,100
This one could bite our heads off.

947
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,900
<i>At ease, gentlemen.</i>

948
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,600
<i>At ease.</i>

949
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:00,800
I am delighted to see you again, General Helm.

950
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:03,100
It's a great honour, Reichsfuhrer.

951
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,800
<i>And you, ColoneI Kappler.</i>

952
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,900
I am to convey to you, General,

953
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:10,900
the Fuhrer's personal congratulations

954
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:15,900
on the bravery and devotion of the SS
throughout this Italian campaign.

955
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:20,500
It is our only wish to be worthy of your trust,
Reichsfuhrer.

956
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,300
You have it entirely.

957
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,400
Do you find it cold in here?

958
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,800
No, sir.

959
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,400
<i>Damp air, I expect.</i>

960
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:38,100
Not good for my sinuses.

961
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,400
Several days ago, Colonel,

962
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,800
General Helm sent a cable
informing me of your success...

963
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,600
.. in rooting out all resistance groups in Rome.

964
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,200
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

965
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,300
It was most encouraging.

966
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,000
I showed it at once to the Fuhrer.

967
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,600
The Fuhrer... read it?

968
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,900
More than read it, my dear Colonel.

969
01:24:04,100 --> 01:24:06,300
It became the main subject of our discussion.

970
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,500
It so happened...
it tied in with an important policy matter.

971
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:15,400
Now I need to know
just how complete your success is.

972
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:17,600
It's a very big city, sir.

973
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:21,600
Over a million inhabitants, and there are
bound to be one or two spots of unrest.

974
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,900
Quite so. Quite so. Colonel?

975
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:27,400
The teeth of the Resistance have been drawn,
Reichsfuhrer.

976
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:30,500
We have broken the spirit of the partisans.
- Good.

977
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,700
There are no more incidents.

978
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,300
Very good.

979
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,900
But the report referred specifically

980
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,600
to the escape organisation.

981
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:43,200
Which you said was controlled...

982
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,800
.. from the Vatican.

983
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,500
You do not mention that.

984
01:24:49,100 --> 01:24:52,600
Colonel Kappler has had some success there,
too, Reichsfuhrer.

985
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,900
Some success?

986
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:58,000
You told me it had been totally destroyed.

987
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:01,000
Er, not entirely, sir. We closed part of it.

988
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:03,900
In other words, the report was inaccurate.
I was misled.

989
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,800
Not exactly, sir.
I expect to round up those escaped...

990
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:11,800
What you are admitting...
is that Rome is still not fully under our control.

991
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:13,400
Is that so?

992
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,000
Is that it?

993
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,000
I chose you to go to Rome, Colonel,

994
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:27,700
because I knew that you would allow nothing
to stand in the way of your success. Nothing.

995
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,900
Now I have to go to the Fuhrer,

996
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,600
at a time when he is under great pressure...

997
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,900
.. with the Americans and the British
poised across the English Channel,

998
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,400
with the damnable winter
driving our forces out of Russia,

999
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,800
with our army here in Italy
preparing to fall back before it is encircled...

1000
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,800
<i>I am to go to him and say</i>

1001
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,500
I was misinformed.

1002
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:56,000
That the report
on which he has made vital decisions...

1003
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,000
.. was false.

1004
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,300
I could break that organisation

1005
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:06,000
in one day, Reichsfuhrer.

1006
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,200
Oh, you could, could you?

1007
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:09,500
How?

1008
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,900
Tell me how.

1009
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,000
The man who runs it is a priest.

1010
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,700
Protected by the Vatican.

1011
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,100
If you would just allow me to... go in and get him.

1012
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,800
No, no, no!

1013
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,500
That is one thing you will not do.

1014
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:31,600
It would bring about a crisis affecting policies
far beyond this present situation.

1015
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,500
Rome must belong to us...

1016
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,800
.. so it can be used as bargaining.

1017
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:42,100
You will not enter the Vatican...

1018
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,400
.. but you will smash that organisation.

1019
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:48,300
Do you hear me?

1020
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,700
You will do it now.

1021
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,600
I chose you for this job, Colonel Kappler.

1022
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,800
I would not like to think I had made a mistake.

1023
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,900
Tale Of Vienna Woods

1024
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:53,500
I'd like to invite you to my party, Monsignor,
but I'm not sure I will.

1025
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,600
Why is that, now?
- You flirt with all the ladies and not just with me.

1026
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,200
Ah, forgive me, Contessa.

1027
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,100
When a man in my profession
is surrounded by beautiful women,

1028
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,900
the only safety is in numbers.

1029
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:10,500
What in hell are you doing here?

1030
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,900
Attending the enemy's parties
is the only way to learn what's going on.

1031
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:16,800
You should have turned this invitation down.
Kappler is here.

1032
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
I've seen him.

1033
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:21,800
Oh, Count, there'll be a load of food supplies
delivered to the consulate tomorrow.

1034
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,700
Some nuns will be around to collect it
in the afternoon.

1035
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,600
Hugh.

1036
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,000
Colonel Kappler! What a surprise.

1037
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,700
Not for me, Monsignor.

1038
01:28:38,300 --> 01:28:40,300
I was looking forward to continuing our talk.

1039
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:44,400
Were you, now? I would have thought we'd
covered just about everything there was to say.

1040
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,800
Ah, but that was before
I'd given you my... autograph.

1041
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,800
Before I'd heard of your reputation
for being so amusing.

1042
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,600
<i>You also have quite a reputation.
- True.</i>

1043
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,700
But I am German, and know my enemies.

1044
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,000
You are Irish.

1045
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:04,900
How strange to feel such concern
for the enemies of your country.

1046
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,600
Speaking of your enemies,

1047
01:29:06,900 --> 01:29:09,500
that's just about the entire civilised world, isn't it?

1048
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,500
I was told you had wit.
I find you disappointingly obvious.

1049
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,600
Well, forgive me. I just wanted to make sure
that you understood my meaning.

1050
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,000
Do not attempt to provoke me.

1051
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,200
I had you invited here to give you a warning.

1052
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:31,700
After tonight, if you take one step
outside the Vatican territory,

1053
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,600
you'll be arrested on sight.

1054
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,400
Colonel, do I get the feeling
that you'd like to put a crimp in my social life?

1055
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:41,800
Damn you and your social life!

1056
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,300
You stay behind that white line, or you'll spend
the rest of the war in Regina Coeli prison.

1057
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:49,200
The way the war is going,
that might not be long at all.

1058
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,700
<i>You listen to me, priest.
- No, you listen to me!</i>

1059
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,500
I'm from a neutral country.

1060
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:55,500
I have diplomatic immunity.

1061
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,700
I am a member of the Holy Office
of the Catholic Church.

1062
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:02,400
You cannot tell me what to do.

1063
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:07,400
I... own... Rome.

1064
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:11,100
Not you,

1065
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:13,300
not the Pope.

1066
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,100
Just because you wear a frock,
it won't protect you.

1067
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,300
Remember your gun-runner priest?

1068
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,200
<i>I do remember him.</i>

1069
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:25,400
And so does every person in Italy
who understands the meaning of freedom.

1070
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,600
Get out.

1071
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,600
Get out!

1072
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:42,300
<i>Go back to the Vatican where you belong.</i>

1073
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:46,100
This is your last party.

1074
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:31,000
This is something I wanted you to see,
Monsignor.

1075
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,200
The glories of the Vatican palace...

1076
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,500
.. that I used to love so much when I was a boy...

1077
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:44,500
.. now packed away down here.

1078
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,600
Irreplaceable treasures - Leonardo, Raphael,

1079
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:54,400
and relics - infinitely more precious -
of Saint Francis, of Saint Catherine of Siena,

1080
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,300
the records and archives, letters,

1081
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,300
from Saint Augustine, Martin Luther,

1082
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:05,300
even from Henry Vlll of England
to the Holy Office seeking for a divorce.

1083
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,300
Nearly two thousand years of history.

1084
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,500
It staggers the mind, Holy Father.

1085
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,100
And here it is now, buried beneath the ground

1086
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,800
behind steel doors
from the threats of shells and bombs.

1087
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,300
Protected from man's inhumanity.

1088
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,700
Our past is full of bloodshed, Monsignor.

1089
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,700
Armies have trampled us,

1090
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,900
yet nothing has changed.

1091
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:35,600
Conquerors may come and go,
but the eternal Church must remain.

1092
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,400
And so it will, Your Holiness.

1093
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:45,000
I have inherited the responsibility of
all the popes, right back to Saint Peter himself.

1094
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,400
My greatest single duty

1095
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,300
is to preserve the continuity of the centuries...

1096
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,100
the heritage and existence of the Holy Church.

1097
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,900
I have been condemned by many...

1098
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,700
<i>.. for not speaking out against Nazism.</i>

1099
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:06,000
For making a concordat with Hitler...

1100
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,100
.. which guaranteed the life of the Church
in Germany.

1101
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,000
Was I wrong?

1102
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,500
It may not have seemed so at that time,
Holy Father.

1103
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:20,400
Well, perhaps I could have done more.

1104
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,500
The white line is a very precarious boundary
for us now. It's impossible to defend it.

1105
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:33,000
I was surprised to see
the Palatine Guards carrying arms.

1106
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,000
Only a token.

1107
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:38,100
I have learned that Hitler
has drawn up plans to invade us,

1108
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:42,100
and to create a puppet papacy in Liechtenstein
under his control.

1109
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,800
Surely you don't think he'd go as far as that?

1110
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,900
That depends on many factors -

1111
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:49,100
on the progress of the war,

1112
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,800
on the result of secret negotiations...

1113
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:57,300
.. on how great a danger the Vatican seems
to the military authorities here in Rome.

1114
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,600
I understand the difficulties.

1115
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,400
I'm glad you do.

1116
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:06,900
<i>I'm glad you realise that any activities which
give the Nazis an excuse to invade our territory</i>

1117
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:09,400
must be avoided at all costs.

1118
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,000
<i>All such activities must cease.</i>

1119
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,800
The essence of statesmanship
is compromise, Monsignor.

1120
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,300
I'm not a statesman, Your Holiness.

1121
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,100
The questions I ask are more simple.

1122
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:29,300
I look at things and try to understand them
in simpler ways.

1123
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,300
Yes. What question
are you asking yourself now?

1124
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:35,000
The only one that seems to matter, Holy Father.

1125
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:39,000
What is our duty
when we come face to face with evil?

1126
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,900
We must fight it.

1127
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,000
If we must fight,

1128
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,000
how can we compromise with it?

1129
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,300
In the abstract, we cannot.

1130
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:53,900
In practical terms, it is sometimes necessary
to proceed slowly and with caution.

1131
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,300
But isn't that the same as saying
it depends on the circumstances?

1132
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,900
When I was an altar boy,

1133
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,600
the old priest who taught us used to say,
"Do what is right, come hell or high water,

1134
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
and God will give you the upper hand. "

1135
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:11,100
Sancta simplicitas.

1136
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:14,100
For some it is easier than others.

1137
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:17,400
Is it ever right

1138
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,100
to see innocent people in mortal danger...

1139
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,400
.. and turn your back on them?

1140
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,300
<i>Holy Father, at this very moment</i>

1141
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:33,200
I'm responsible for the safety of over 4,000
people hidden in Rome and outside the city.

1142
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,400
So many?

1143
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:44,900
I have spoken to you from the heart, my son.

1144
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:48,600
You must do what you believe best.

1145
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:51,400
<i>Think of what I have said.</i>

1146
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,500
<i>God guide your decision.</i>

1147
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:38,700
So many are depending on me.

1148
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:43,700
Or is that the sin of pride?

1149
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,700
What should I do?

1150
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,500
If my life could help you, my friend,

1151
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,200
I would give it.

1152
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,200
I can give you the blessing of the Church,

1153
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,400
but...

1154
01:36:57,700 --> 01:37:00,100
only you can decide.

1155
01:38:31,700 --> 01:38:33,300
Thank you, Prince Mateo.

1156
01:38:33,500 --> 01:38:36,000
There is more I can do to help.

1157
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,700
Do you have time for some tea?
- That's the one thing I can't resist.

1158
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,500
Only a moment, though.
If I don't get back soon,

1159
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:47,600
my friends will be as nervous as long-tailed cats
in a room full of rocking chairs.

1160
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,500
The emperors of Rome.

1161
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,500
Masters of the world.

1162
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,700
Were they like the Fuhrer, Pappi?

1163
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,400
<i>A little like him, Franz.</i>

1164
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,000
But with a difference.

1165
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,600
The Roman Empire did not survive.

1166
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,000
The Reich will last for a thousand years.

1167
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:14,400
Yes, Pappi.

1168
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,400
One day, you may take my place, huh?

1169
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,700
And then, in time,

1170
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,400
your sons will grow up and carry on the work.

1171
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:34,300
It's definite.
The Germans are pulling back in the south.

1172
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,000
They can no longer hold their defence lines.

1173
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:41,100
If they're true to form, though,
they'll not give up without a hell of a fight.

1174
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,900
Still, it's good to hear.

1175
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,000
Thank you again, Prince.

1176
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:48,700
I wish I could do more, Hugh.

1177
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,900
Like many others, I would like to...

1178
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:08,000
The Gestapo! Quickly!

1179
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,200
Leutnant, take some men and cover the exits.

1180
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:12,900
The rest of you, up those stairs and spread out!

1181
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:17,700
Remember, I want him alive.

1182
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,500
This door leads to the kitchen.

1183
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:22,900
Hide in one of the storerooms.

1184
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:25,000
I'll try to hold them as long as I can.

1185
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:27,700
Good luck.

1186
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:30,300
What is the meaning of this?

1187
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,000
Do you know who I am?

1188
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:35,900
It's an outrage! I shall speak to your superiors!

1189
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,000
Where is he? Where is O'Flaherty?
- What are you talking about?

1190
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:42,600
He was seen here. He's with you.
- What a ridiculous accusation, Colonel.

1191
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:46,300
<i>Quite obviously he is not here.
- Spread out! Search every room!</i>

1192
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,400
Finish your work.

1193
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,500
Get out.

1194
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,200
Druben.

1195
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,400
<i>Don't look round.</i>

1196
01:41:41,700 --> 01:41:43,100
<i>Don't even move.</i>

1197
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:44,600
Who are you?

1198
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:47,900
A priest. It's me the Gestapo are after.

1199
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:50,300
What do you want me to do?

1200
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,000
Just climb down here.

1201
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:03,800
Well, what do you think?

1202
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,600
What happens to me if they recognise you?

1203
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:10,100
You'd better hit me, Father.

1204
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:12,700
Holy Mother!

1205
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,400
Are you sure?
- Right here.

1206
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,700
God bless you.

1207
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:42,400
Hey, coalman!

1208
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:44,300
Yup.

1209
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,400
That's enough work. Get out of here.

1210
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:49,100
Ja.

1211
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,900
You're a dead man, priest.

1212
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,800
It was sheer luck they missed. You know that.

1213
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:16,100
Keep telling him that, Francesca.

1214
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,300
But I can't stay cooped up in here.

1215
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,700
Don't you understand?
They are going to kill you.

1216
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,400
Come in!

1217
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:24,500
Ah, Sister Candida.

1218
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:26,700
Come on in. Ah, you're an angel.

1219
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,700
You're an angel.
Thank you, my dear. Thank you.

1220
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,500
You've done enough, Hugh.

1221
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,200
It's not so urgent now.

1222
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:37,800
The Allies will be here in a few weeks.

1223
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,300
Hey, are you listening?

1224
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:44,000
What on earth are you doing?

1225
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:07,100
Buongiorno, Capitano.

1226
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:10,600
How about a special portrait
of His Holiness the Pope, huh?

1227
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,600
Go away.
- It is blessed by the Holy Father himself.

1228
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:15,800
No? No.

1229
01:48:16,100 --> 01:48:18,600
How about a medallion of Saint Christopher?
Huh?

1230
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,400
Sehr billig. Very cheap.

1231
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,200
I told you to leave me alone! Get out of here!

1232
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:00,500
Good morning, Guila.

1233
01:49:00,700 --> 01:49:02,900
Monsignor!
- Don't go bobbing at me, now.

1234
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:07,100
Now, tell your mother to expect
three more boarders just for two nights.

1235
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,700
Oh, and Jack sends his love.

1236
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,200
<i>How is he?
- He's going crazy in the Vatican.</i>

1237
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:14,500
I don't think he's cut out to be a priest.

1238
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,000
But he's fine.

1239
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:18,900
Goodbye for now.
I'm getting behind in my sweeping.

1240
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,600
<i>He has been reported all over the city, sir.</i>

1241
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,800
Dressed as a dustman, a coalman,

1242
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,600
an ambulance driver, a mailman.

1243
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,100
The Angel Gabriel, no doubt.
People will swallow any nonsense.

1244
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,000
Even the ridiculous story
that he dressed up as a nun.

1245
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:45,400
People will believe anything about him.

1246
01:50:45,700 --> 01:50:47,200
He must be stopped.

1247
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,900
We have tried everything, sir.

1248
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:52,600
No.

1249
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:55,700
Not quite everything.

1250
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:56,500
Well, it's not that I'm not glad to see you, Alfred...

1251
01:51:57,800 --> 01:52:00,100
.. but where in the holy name
did you come from?

1252
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,100
Well, seeing as they didn't get you outside,
it was a safe bet they'd come in after you.

1253
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:06,300
So I've been watching your back.

1254
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,000
God bless you.

1255
01:52:43,400 --> 01:52:45,900
Bang! Bang! You're dead, Pappi!

1256
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,400
You never do that again! Do you hear me?

1257
01:52:48,700 --> 01:52:50,000
Never!

1258
01:52:50,200 --> 01:52:52,100
Herbert! What...?

1259
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:55,300
You poor darling. It's all right, it's all right.

1260
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:57,800
Did you hit him?

1261
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,400
You've never touched the children.

1262
01:53:00,700 --> 01:53:03,900
You've never raised your voice at them
in all their lives.

1263
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:43,100
Be a good girl. I'll be seeing you later.

1264
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:45,800
Goodbye, Sister.

1265
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,200
Hugh.
- Yes.

1266
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,100
Alfred told me.

1267
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:14,400
Thank God you're safe.
- Don't you go thinking I'm that easy to get rid of.

1268
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:17,200
Please, don't joke.

1269
01:54:18,100 --> 01:54:20,000
You haven't heard?

1270
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,700
Heard what?

1271
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,800
Father Vittorio.

1272
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:29,700
Kappler has him at Gestapo headquarters.
- No, no.

1273
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,700
No, no. He left Rome three days ago,

1274
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,200
to visit our billets in the country.

1275
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,000
He never got there. The SS stopped him.

1276
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:41,200
They found money.

1277
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:43,400
They think he's a British spy.

1278
01:54:43,700 --> 01:54:47,100
He's being interrogated at Regina Coeli,
but has told them nothing.

1279
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:51,400
<i>He's being moved tomorrow
to a concentration camp in Germany.</i>

1280
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:54,200
Oh, my God.

1281
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,600
I've got to go to him. Right away.

1282
01:54:58,900 --> 01:55:00,700
You know that's impossible.

1283
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,500
You might as well give yourself up.

1284
01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:08,500
I'm going to hear his confession
and give him absolution.

1285
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,300
Nothing on God's earth will stop me.

1286
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:37,400
Leave us, Leutnant.

1287
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:54,200
What have they done to you, my friend?

1288
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,100
It's really you?

1289
01:56:59,600 --> 01:57:01,100
Here.

1290
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,300
It's holy water,

1291
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,000
but all the better for that.

1292
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,400
Too dangerous.

1293
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,800
You should not have come.

1294
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,600
Oh, I had to, my dear friend.

1295
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,200
We shall not meet again, I think.

1296
01:57:29,100 --> 01:57:32,800
I came... to give you absolution.

1297
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:36,900
Thank you.

1298
01:57:37,100 --> 01:57:39,900
I have already made confession to God.

1299
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:45,200
<i>I heard something when they tortured me.</i>

1300
01:57:48,300 --> 01:57:53,100
You must not go again to Francesca's.

1301
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:56,600
Why not?

1302
01:57:56,900 --> 01:57:59,300
<i>Her apartment is being watched...</i>

1303
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,300
<i>.. in case you go there.</i>

1304
01:58:03,600 --> 01:58:06,100
You're sure, Vittorio?

1305
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,600
Kappler...

1306
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:12,600
could not make me talk,

1307
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,400
but he talked...

1308
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,800
.. as if I... I was already dead.

1309
01:58:20,200 --> 01:58:24,600
<i>He will have her arrested any time now.</i>

1310
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:37,600
Here.

1311
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:40,300
This is for you.

1312
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:45,300
Please... take it with you.

1313
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,300
Hail Mary,

1314
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:56,800
full of grace,

1315
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,300
the Lord is with thee.

1316
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:01,200
<i>Blessed art thou among women.</i>

1317
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:04,900
<i>And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.</i>

1318
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:07,500
Holy Mary,

1319
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,500
Mother of God,

1320
01:59:09,800 --> 01:59:13,100
pray for us sinners now
and at the hour of our death.

1321
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:16,900
Amen.

1322
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:44,200
Guila, you take Tate and the others
to San Giovanni Maggiore.

1323
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:46,300
Tell them that I sent you.

1324
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,300
This building's being watched, so use
the cellar door and go out through the garden.

1325
01:59:50,700 --> 01:59:52,600
You got friends you can stay with?
- Yes.

1326
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:54,600
Go to them as soon as the others are clear.

1327
01:59:54,900 --> 01:59:57,500
Don't take anything but your purse.
- Yes, Monsignor.

1328
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:01,300
I'm not leaving Emilia with anyone.

1329
02:00:01,600 --> 02:00:04,800
She's going with us.
I'm going to get you safely out of Rome.

1330
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:08,300
There is no doubt about it, Colonel.

1331
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:10,700
He was in an SS uniform.

1332
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:14,000
He was seen entering the woman's apartment.
It must have been him.

1333
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:16,100
By the time the alert was put out,

1334
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,100
he had left the city and driven through the gates.

1335
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,200
I want every approach to the Vatican sealed off.

1336
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:28,000
Put out his description.

1337
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:32,500
I want every available man in the streets.

1338
02:00:35,700 --> 02:00:38,200
And get him.

1339
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,900
Get him.

1340
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:53,400
Allies will be here in a week or so.

1341
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:56,800
Germans will be driven out of Rome
and you can return.

1342
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:59,600
Stay with us.

1343
02:00:59,900 --> 02:01:03,700
There's nothing I'd want more, Francesca,
than to stay here, but...

1344
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,300
.. I can't.

1345
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:09,900
If the Germans break our escape line,
I have to be there to do what I can.

1346
02:01:10,200 --> 02:01:14,500
I have a terrible feeling
that I might never see you again.

1347
02:01:14,900 --> 02:01:17,600
I told you. I'm not that easy to get rid of.

1348
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:20,300
Please, Hugh, don't go.

1349
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,500
I'm sorry.

1350
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,800
You've given so much of your strength to others.

1351
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,000
I don't want to take what's left of it.

1352
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:34,300
Oh, I'm just stubborn.
You're the one who's strong.

1353
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,900
I thought I was.

1354
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:40,200
I thought there was a good God looking after us

1355
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:43,000
who would make sure
everything turned out all right.

1356
02:01:43,300 --> 02:01:45,400
And he will do.

1357
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:47,500
I'll try to believe that.

1358
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:50,200
Of course you will.

1359
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:33,200
<i>So, after months of stalemate,
our forces are on the move again.</i>

1360
02:02:33,500 --> 02:02:36,800
<i>US and British divisions
under the command of GeneraI Mark Clark</i>

1361
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,100
<i>have broken out of the Anzio beachhead and
are attacking the Nazi stronghold of Cisterna,</i>

1362
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:44,500
<i>driving the enemy to the hills
where they are pounded day and night</i>

1363
02:02:44,700 --> 02:02:46,400
<i>by our tanks and dive bombers.</i>

1364
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:49,400
<i>The Canadians
have broken through the Hitler Line,</i>

1365
02:02:49,700 --> 02:02:52,900
<i>and GeneraI Alexander's Eighth Army
has crossed the river,</i>

1366
02:02:53,300 --> 02:02:55,800
<i>taking 10,000 German prisoners.</i>

1367
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:58,600
<i>The battles of Anzio and Cassino are over.</i>

1368
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:04,300
<i>And injust a few days now,
the big one will begin.</i>

1369
02:03:05,700 --> 02:03:08,200
<i>The battle for Rome.</i>

1370
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:29,300
Herr Major? Moment, bitte.

1371
02:03:31,300 --> 02:03:33,800
Herr Major, Moment.

1372
02:03:34,300 --> 02:03:36,800
Halt!

1373
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:42,100
Dahinten.

1374
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:48,400
Schnell. Schnell!

1375
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:51,800
Nachher.

1376
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:04,400
<i>Schnell.</i>

1377
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:08,600
<i>Er muss in die Kirche sein.</i>

1378
02:05:25,800 --> 02:05:28,300
Herbert?

1379
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:32,400
So late, darling. Where have you been?

1380
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,900
Military headquarters.

1381
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,900
Minna...

1382
02:05:47,600 --> 02:05:50,100
.. first thing in the morning, I want you to pack.

1383
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,500
What?

1384
02:05:53,800 --> 02:05:55,500
In two days,

1385
02:05:55,700 --> 02:05:58,100
three at the most...

1386
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:00,800
.. we evacuate Rome.

1387
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:04,100
But you were ready to defend it.
You said we had weeks yet.

1388
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:09,000
It is not to be defended, or attacked, it seems.

1389
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:14,300
This way, Rome is saved and we save our army.

1390
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,500
You'll... you'll have to give me
some crates and some boxes and...

1391
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,700
There's no point.
You can only take what you need.

1392
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,400
What about my things? I can't just leave them.
- You'll have to.

1393
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:29,600
Herbert, I won't. All my things. I just...

1394
02:06:29,900 --> 02:06:32,300
Don't you understand?

1395
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:36,600
You'll be lucky to get away.

1396
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

1397
02:06:46,200 --> 02:06:48,900
You said there was no danger.
What about the children?

1398
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:51,700
Listen to me. Listen.

1399
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:55,000
Up until yesterday, there was no problem.

1400
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:00,200
But now, it's chaos here.

1401
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:03,000
There's no transport left.

1402
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,500
I have to arrange something.

1403
02:07:07,700 --> 02:07:10,200
Will you come with us?

1404
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:13,100
That might not be possible.

1405
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:18,600
But you and the children must be ready.

1406
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:31,000
Where are you going?

1407
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:34,900
There's still something I have to do.
- What?

1408
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:37,400
Herbert?

1409
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:40,100
Herbert.

1410
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,700
Call for help and you are dead.

1411
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:21,700
You're going to kill me anyway.
- Not if you listen.

1412
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,600
I have come here personally
with a message from Colonel Kappler.

1413
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,100
He wishes to see you.

1414
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:33,000
At Gestapo Headquarters, no doubt.

1415
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,900
This is to be a private meeting.

1416
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,100
Tonight, just the two of you.

1417
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:41,800
Your safety is guaranteed.

1418
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,600
Guaranteed, is it?

1419
02:08:45,300 --> 02:08:47,800
Where?

1420
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:51,000
The Colosseum.

1421
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,500
You alone?
- I am.

1422
02:09:35,100 --> 02:09:36,500
Not afraid I'll shoot you?

1423
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:40,100
If you'd been going to kill me, your man
would already have done it in my room.

1424
02:09:40,500 --> 02:09:43,000
That is so.

1425
02:09:43,600 --> 02:09:47,400
But believe me, at this moment,
nothing would give me greater pleasure.

1426
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:52,300
When it comes down to it, a bullet's your answer
to just about everything, isn't it?

1427
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,400
The only argument you've got.

1428
02:09:54,600 --> 02:09:58,000
I know what you think of me,
you and your Church, but you forget...

1429
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:01,100
I have my orders.

1430
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,800
I am a soldier. I do my duty.

1431
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:08,200
You can't hide behind that, Kappler.
Don't debase the word "duty".

1432
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:12,000
My orders were to occupy Rome, control the city.

1433
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:15,000
In a war, that means whatever it takes to do it,

1434
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:16,600
whether you like it or not.

1435
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:19,500
And do you think that absolves you
of any responsibility?

1436
02:10:19,700 --> 02:10:21,600
Yes.

1437
02:10:21,900 --> 02:10:24,300
What is important is the Reich.

1438
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:27,100
Not Rome. What is Rome?

1439
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:30,700
All its greatness is over.

1440
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:33,500
All that's left is a picture postcard,

1441
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:36,100
a playground for whores and priests.

1442
02:10:36,400 --> 02:10:39,100
<i>There will be a new order in Europe.</i>

1443
02:10:40,300 --> 02:10:43,400
We are evacuating Rome now,
but that means nothing.

1444
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:45,500
We will be back.

1445
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:49,500
The Third Reich... is the future.

1446
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:53,600
How many murderous dictators
have talked that kind of rubbish?

1447
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:56,900
Just look around you, Kappler.

1448
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:00,700
You're standing where your ancient friends
entertained themselves,

1449
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,200
watching lions tear the Christians to pieces,

1450
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:06,400
but the Church is still here.

1451
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:09,400
A lot of broken stones like these.

1452
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:13,100
In a few years,
that's all that'll be left of your Third Reich.

1453
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,000
Keep your history lesson, priest.

1454
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:19,300
You crawl to your pope and obey his orders,
just as I obey mine.

1455
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:22,300
You compare obedience to Hitler

1456
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:25,000
with the faith a priest owes to his Church?

1457
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,500
You think that's the same?

1458
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,200
In the name of God!

1459
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,800
Wait.

1460
02:11:33,300 --> 02:11:35,800
I know about you.

1461
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:38,000
And your Church.

1462
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:40,800
I've been... talking to people.

1463
02:11:42,100 --> 02:11:44,600
I know all about you.

1464
02:11:54,400 --> 02:11:56,900
What is it you want from me...

1465
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,500
.. Kappler?

1466
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:03,000
They say that you can't pass a beggar...

1467
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,900
.. or a lame dog...

1468
02:12:08,200 --> 02:12:11,100
.. but that you see yourself
with some sort of obligation

1469
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:14,800
to look after... anyone in trouble.

1470
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:18,200
You help British and American prisoners.

1471
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:22,900
Jews, Arabs, refugees, anybody.

1472
02:12:23,300 --> 02:12:27,000
It's a... part of your faith.

1473
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:29,900
Is that right?

1474
02:12:30,200 --> 02:12:33,300
Well, I wouldn't deny it.
That's why I became a priest.

1475
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:35,800
Brotherly love

1476
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,900
and forgiveness.

1477
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:42,800
That's... the other half of what you believe.

1478
02:12:43,200 --> 02:12:44,800
<i>True?</i>

1479
02:12:45,100 --> 02:12:45,900
True.

1480
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:48,600
Well, I'm glad of it...

1481
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:52,200
.. because I have three more
for your mercy wagon.

1482
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,500
My wife...

1483
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,800
and two children.

1484
02:12:57,100 --> 02:12:59,900
<i>If the partisans get them, they will be killed.</i>

1485
02:13:00,100 --> 02:13:02,300
I want them out of Rome

1486
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:05,000
and safe.

1487
02:13:05,900 --> 02:13:08,400
That's what I want from you, priest.

1488
02:13:09,700 --> 02:13:13,200
You're asking me to save your family?

1489
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:16,400
If you really believe what you preach...

1490
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:19,000
.. you'll do it.

1491
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:23,200
You expect me to help you
after what you've done?

1492
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,500
You think you can demand forgiveness?

1493
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,200
You think it comes automatically

1494
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:31,700
<i>just because you want it?</i>

1495
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,100
I'm not talking about myself.

1496
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:36,900
You've turned this city
into a concentration camp.

1497
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,700
You've tortured and butchered my friends.

1498
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,100
You've violated every principle of God and man.

1499
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:50,300
I can't believe that after all you've done,

1500
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:52,100
you want mercy.

1501
02:13:52,300 --> 02:13:54,600
I've told you, for my family.

1502
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:57,000
They're just part of you,

1503
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:58,900
part of what you stand for.

1504
02:13:59,200 --> 02:14:01,300
They've taken whatever they could get

1505
02:14:01,500 --> 02:14:04,600
without a thought
for the suffering all around them.

1506
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,300
And now you demand that they be saved.

1507
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:14,700
I'll see you in hell first.

1508
02:14:16,900 --> 02:14:19,200
No.

1509
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,300
You're no different from anyone else.

1510
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:24,500
All your talk means nothing.

1511
02:14:25,900 --> 02:14:29,600
Charity, forgiveness, mercy.

1512
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:32,900
It's all lies.

1513
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:35,600
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1514
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:38,900
<i>Lies!</i>

1515
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:42,000
Don't you talk to me about God...

1516
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:45,400
.. and humanity.

1517
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:48,100
I know what humanity is.

1518
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:52,500
It's one half with the power and the will to use it,

1519
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:55,700
and the other half only cattle to be led.

1520
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,300
There's no God.

1521
02:15:02,200 --> 02:15:04,700
No humanity.

1522
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:07,800
Do you hear me?

1523
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:10,500
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1524
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,600
<i>Priest?</i>

1525
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:18,000
<i>Priest!</i>

1526
02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:10,300
Everybody, just a minute.

1527
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,800
Guila and I have decided
we don't want to wait any longer.

1528
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:20,200
We want to be married.
- Oh, well done, Jack. Congratulations!

1529
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:22,900
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1530
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:25,500
And we want you to tie the knot, Padre.

1531
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,200
It's about time, Jack.
I've had the rope ready for months.

1532
02:16:28,600 --> 02:16:31,000
If you'll pardon me, ladies and gentlemen,

1533
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:35,700
we've all come through
and it's thanks to one man.

1534
02:16:36,100 --> 02:16:37,600
I think we ought to have a toast.

1535
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:39,800
Monsignor O'Flaherty.

1536
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,300
Thank you, my friends.

1537
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:44,500
But if we're to have a toast,
I can think of another one.

1538
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,700
To those we loved,

1539
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,200
those who cannot be here with us today.

1540
02:16:51,500 --> 02:16:53,900
Hear, hear.

1541
02:16:59,700 --> 02:17:04,300
This is only the first inquiry into your activities
as Head of the Gestapo here in Rome.

1542
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:07,900
Do you deny the systematic use of torture
on suspects?

1543
02:17:08,200 --> 02:17:10,600
Only the accepted methods of interrogation
were used.

1544
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:14,700
That is not our information.
- I only did my duty.

1545
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,500
Tell us about the pipeline.

1546
02:17:19,600 --> 02:17:23,300
Come now, Colonel, it is quite obvious
that after your forces retreated,

1547
02:17:23,500 --> 02:17:26,700
you were ordered to set up
a secret line of communication.

1548
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:30,300
Colonel Kappler,
we know all about your wife and children.

1549
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:33,300
Minna, isn't it?

1550
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:36,000
<i>And Franz and Liesel?</i>

1551
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,500
What do you know?

1552
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,500
What has happened to them?

1553
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:46,300
<i>Now you're playing games, ColoneI.</i>

1554
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,300
<i>Your wife and children disappeared from Rome.</i>

1555
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:53,000
<i>They were smuggled into Switzerland,
as you well know,</i>

1556
02:17:53,300 --> 02:17:55,800
<i>safe and sound.</i>

1557
02:17:57,500 --> 02:17:59,600
<i>Now, how was it done?</i>

1558
02:17:59,900 --> 02:18:02,200
<i>Who helped them?</i>

1559
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:05,000
<i>That takes some organisation.</i>

1560
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,100
<i>Now, if you tell us how it was done,</i>

1561
02:18:08,400 --> 02:18:10,200
<i>and who helped them,</i>

1562
02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:12,900
<i>it might do you some good at your triaI.</i>

1563
02:18:15,800 --> 02:18:18,300
I do not know.

1564
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:23,100
<i>Come on, ColoneI.</i>

1565
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:25,800
<i>Tell us. Who was it?</i>

1566
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:35,000
I do not know.

1567
02:18:40,300 --> 02:18:42,800
Stay where you are, my son.

1568
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:46,400
No need to rise.

1569
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:50,100
I have only a few moments.

1570
02:18:50,300 --> 02:18:53,100
This is a great day.
I have to speak to our people.

1571
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:55,900
But first, I wanted to speak to you.

1572
02:18:56,700 --> 02:19:01,000
In this imperfect world, you may never receive
the honour that is due to you.

1573
02:19:02,300 --> 02:19:04,900
But I wanted you to know that in my heart...

1574
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:07,500
.. I honour you.

1575
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:11,000
<i>I talked to you once
of the treasures of the Church.</i>

1576
02:19:12,300 --> 02:19:14,200
<i>Perhaps I deceived myself.</i>

1577
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:18,600
The real treasures of the Church,
what makes it imperishable...

1578
02:19:20,100 --> 02:19:22,600
.. is that every once in a while

1579
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:25,300
someone comes to it, my son...

1580
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:28,600
.. like you.

1581
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,500
May the Lord watch over you.

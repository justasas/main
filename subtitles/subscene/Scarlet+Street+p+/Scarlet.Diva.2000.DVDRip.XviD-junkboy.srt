1
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,911
This year's best actress is...

2
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,111
Anna Battista!

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,676
What are your future projects?

4
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,757
20 films at the age of 20...

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,676
Don't the awards go to your head?

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,997
Next stop, Hollywood?

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,431
Anna, what do you think of love?

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,557
Are you in love right now?

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,598
You want to direct?

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,313
Is your decision final?

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,754
Do you want children?

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,314
Did the Dalai Lama impress you?

13
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,396
How important is the family?

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,959
And religion?

15
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,274
How many hours
do you spend in the gym?

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,598
Do you think Italian cinema is dying?

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,349
Anna!

18
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,872
"Giovanna of the clouds"

19
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,359
Just a second!

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,590
Tyrone!

21
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,715
- They need you on set.
- Just a second.

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,715
The pause is over. Come on!

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,638
What are they doing?

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,110
Fuck it, I didn't come!

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,359
It hurts!

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,754
Dirty stuff again.

27
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,913
Enough. Enough already!

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,796
Remember what this ring means?

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,991
- I was sleeping, mom.
- No.

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,909
I don't believe you!
I'll send you away to school.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,795
To that place in Switzerland
where Chaplin's kids went!

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,949
I've got so much shit on,
so many scripts to read.

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,596
She's too much of a pest,
I can't take any more!

34
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,716
- Read that chapter of "Moby Dick"?
- Yes.

35
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,393
Well done, sis, I'm going to make
a writer of you one day.

36
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,112
I could act, like mom.

37
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,231
Then you'll end up like her.

38
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,192
I keep my panties on.

39
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,551
What?

40
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,830
When I do dirty things,
I keep them on.

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,669
Shut up!

42
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,275
Enough, Alioscia, I'll wet myself.

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,518
Dirty things...

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,951
A tattooed eye.
It's Anna Battista.

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,116
- Show me up!
- Are you Anna Battista?

46
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,437
Have you really got a tattoo
on your fanny?

47
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,952
No, I put it on every morning.
It's a fake, it's trendy.

48
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,229
How far does it go?

49
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,671
Hands off!
Only my husband knows that.

50
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,871
What husband? Where's your ring?

51
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,992
- Her husband...
- Sorry, got to go.

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,474
- Come here!
- A photo!

53
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,433
- She wants to run off...
- Smile!

54
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,913
Give me an autograph.

55
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,758
Grab a pen, man!

56
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,030
- What's your name?
- Maurizio.

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,834
Do one for me too. I'm Dado.

58
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,550
Guys...

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,875
Got to go.

60
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,676
Come back!

61
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,952
Anna, come back!

62
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,719
Don't go!

63
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,999
Stay with us!

64
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,519
Where's she going?

65
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,156
Leave a message for Veronica
after the tone.

66
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,510
Veronica, hi, it's Anna.

67
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm in Locarno for a TV interview.

68
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,199
I'll be in Paris tomorrow.
Be there.

69
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,878
People say...

70
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,672
you're a man-eater.

71
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,555
How would you define yourself?

72
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,115
A relentless romantic.

73
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,192
A fundamentally lonely girl.

74
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,680
It's very hard for me to love someone.

75
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
I've been single for two years now.

76
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,557
- How about you?
- Me?

77
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,557
Tell me about your sex life.

78
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,676
I haven't had sex in five years.

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,799
I understand.

80
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,754
Can I sit next to you?

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,397
Please do.

82
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,471
Can I give you a hug?

83
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,839
Veronica, I'm in Paris.
Where the fuck are you?

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,434
Oh my God!

85
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,836
What the fuck's happened?

86
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,193
Anyone home?

87
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,751
Veronica?

88
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,835
Gross...

89
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,109
Oh my God!

90
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,275
Help!

91
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,796
What the fuck...

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,992
- Anna, untie me!
- How the fuck do I?

93
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,237
Untie the knots. Use the pincers.
Do something!

94
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,509
Calm down...

95
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,111
Where's she keep the pincers?

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,319
Hurry, I can't go on!

97
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,637
Give me a fucking second.
I'm doing my best!

98
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,957
I can't go on! Untie me!

99
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,596
Untie me, Anna!

100
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,429
I'm hurting all over!

101
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,392
Here I am.

102
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,956
Calm down. Stop moving.

103
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,156
Fuck!

104
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,678
Who the fuck did this?

105
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,999
Who was it?

106
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,433
Come here.

107
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,918
Who the fuck was it?

108
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,755
It was Hamid. We fought,
he tied me up like this

109
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,351
and then he left.

110
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,153
How long ago?

111
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,873
Two days, I think.

112
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,431
It's not my fault, Anna.

113
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,437
I'm mad about him.

114
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,790
Why does he have to be like this?

115
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,599
Hamid...

116
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,513
We went to Les Halles.
Where the fuck else?

117
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,275
Yeah, Barbes... Where's the hash?

118
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,111
Hi, how's it going?

119
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,353
- I'm looking for some shit.
- See the Yank.

120
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,278
- The Yank?
- Take her.

121
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,152
- Go with her.
- With me?

122
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,588
My friend waits?

123
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,995
- I'll wait.
- Won't be long.

124
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,120
- What's that guy's name?
- Who? Hamid?

125
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,152
Yeah, Hamid...

126
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,948
Give me some of your apple?

127
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,479
I've finished it.

128
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,557
It's tough today.
In fact, I'm here in Paris

129
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,991
because I'm an actress and...
You know?

130
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,637
- What's "to fuck" in French?
- "Baiser".

131
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,188
Let's go.

132
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,631
A real piece of shit...

133
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,150
We used to be a threesome,
then she went solo.

134
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,717
Veronica, forget Hamid.

135
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,230
This thing has to stop.
Enough already.

136
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,557
I know, but subconsciously
I'm asking him to do it.

137
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,072
What the fuck do you mean?
You're like those American housewives

138
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,472
who get beaten up
and don't rat on their men.

139
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,831
Get dressed,
we're going to the fucking police

140
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,476
and that piece
of shit's going to jail.

141
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,869
Not dead yet, you dirty whore?

142
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,990
Bastard!

143
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,873
Let me do the talking. Calm down.

144
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,072
A man who beats a woman
has got no balls.

145
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,191
What do you do?

146
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,595
Beat up girls? You're a shithead.

147
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,509
I'm going to the police
about you, get it?

148
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,430
Don't!

149
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,231
You're evil!
You can't treat me like a whore!

150
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,715
Leave me alone. Don't touch me!

151
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,151
This time, I'll kill you,
I swear I will!

152
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,119
I'm not a whore!

153
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,599
I love you.

154
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,639
Guys, I'm outta here...
See you after the gig, okay.

155
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,589
Shall I go?

156
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,199
I'll wait for you.

157
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,079
Bye, see you later.

158
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,032
Hold on, I'll show you something.
It's really important.

159
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,073
You like it? It's a gun.

160
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,514
You're my love.
I'll wait for you forever.

161
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,868
Who the fuck
d'you think you are, bitch?

162
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,469
I'll get you, you whore!

163
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,832
It's Veronica.

164
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,316
Hamid's left me.

165
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,112
I caught him screwing another woman.

166
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,591
I want to die.

167
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,434
If you don't call, I'm killing myself.

168
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,358
The wasteland...

169
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,353
Anna, it's grandma.

170
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,436
Where are you?

171
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,474
Recently you've seemed
so detached and sceptical...

172
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,671
You seem unattainable.

173
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,277
I love you all the same.

174
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,470
Who is it?

175
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,229
Quelou.

176
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,750
Who are you?

177
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,915
Quelou.

178
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,074
- What a great apartment.
- You like it?

179
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,589
I didn't get a good look last time.

180
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,233
Last time?

181
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,639
Quelou...

182
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,673
Quelou?

183
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,271
I'm sorry, I remember you but...

184
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,993
I feel kind of...

185
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,396
Tell me, where was it we met?

186
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,793
At a party?

187
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,635
On a plane?

188
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,196
What do you do?

189
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,877
You really don't remember?

190
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,559
Listen...

191
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,999
I've got a cab waiting downstairs

192
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,830
and I have to leave in half an hour.
D'you want

193
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,589
to get off?

194
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,273
You're scaring me.

195
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,232
What do you mean, scaring you?

196
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,273
Remember
how you licked me last time?

197
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,794
When?

198
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,791
You're like a child...

199
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,719
I have to be going now.

200
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,991
- You have to go?
- Yes.

201
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,196
I don't want to miss my flight.

202
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,074
Give me your number and I'll call you.

203
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,872
You know, I'm really catching a plane.

204
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,874
Thanks.

205
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,359
- In case I lose it...
- You mustn't.

206
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,638
Are you crazy?
All this fuss over measles!

207
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,558
Did you bring my Roip?

208
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,550
I'm cold.

209
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,149
- So cold.
- Anna, dear...

210
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,636
aren't you pleased
to stay at home for a few days?

211
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,197
Don't say that in front of her.

212
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,630
What does she know
about pharmaceuticals?

213
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,876
Alioscia?

214
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,598
If I die,
you can have all my stickers.

215
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,273
Mom! Wake up,
we've made your breakfast.

216
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,910
Overdose.

217
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,436
Who the hell do we call?

218
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,428
You forgot to feed them again.

219
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,595
You're like your mother.

220
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,394
I don't know why I married you.

221
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,353
Married me?

222
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,756
What d'you mean?

223
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,475
I'm the father of your son.

224
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,559
I don't know who you are.

225
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,475
My baby!

226
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,114
My baby! Help!

227
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,712
In the head!

228
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,956
- Who is it?
- Mrs... or Miss Battista?

229
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,835
What time is it?

230
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,519
Just a second.

231
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,513
Half past ten.

232
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,075
I'm Vessi, your gynaecologist.

233
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,952
It's about the test...

234
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,153
Yes.

235
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,555
The pregnancy test.

236
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,549
And?

237
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,679
Pregnant.

238
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,989
Hello?

239
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,752
What shall we do now?
Another abortion?

240
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,392
No, doctor.

241
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,998
Not an abortion.

242
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,398
Okay, no abortion.

243
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,473
See you soon.

244
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Paaradei's buying...

245
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,632
the US distribution rights.

246
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,552
It's a great opportunity.

247
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,957
Barry Paar came here in person
to sign the deal.

248
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,310
I mean, it's incredible.

249
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,112
Totally incredible!

250
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,599
What the fuck?

251
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,758
Congratulations on the award!

252
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,279
Good to see you!

253
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,512
Cleopatra... What's up?

254
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,312
I've lost my shoes,

255
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,511
my fur, the award, everything!

256
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,835
What happened?

257
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,837
Who the fuck
did you leave me with?

258
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,473
What d'you mean?

259
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,193
The guy's a top producer.

260
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,391
Barry Paar wanted to screw me.

261
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,114
He said, "I want to eat your fur pie."

262
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,435
Calm down, okay.

263
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,198
Look at the mess I'm in!

264
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,992
Okay, forget that now.

265
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,236
You fly to London tomorrow.

266
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,394
London... God, she's forgotten!

267
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,556
The Vogue shoot with Luke Ford.

268
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,195
That's actress shit. I want to direct.

269
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,594
For God's sake...

270
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,553
Why do they all want
to be directors here?

271
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,797
You're my agent.
You have to help me direct.

272
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,797
I sent you to Barry Paar.

273
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,436
You sent me to a shithead
who wanted to rape me!

274
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,559
What is this place?
"Shining"?

275
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,279
I don't believe it...

276
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,589
Calm down!

277
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,029
Anna, get up.

278
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,834
The crapper...

279
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,157
This isn't me.

280
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,079
This isn't me...

281
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,118
They're laughing at me.

282
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,478
They can see me.

283
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,198
Let's wash our face.

284
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,755
Like this...

285
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,193
My baby...

286
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:29,631
My belly...

287
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,674
Get away from me!

288
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:20,794
Let her die.

289
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:08,993
Anna, its Margherita.

290
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,919
I've got the Cleopatra pages

291
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,270
for Saturday's screen test in LA.

292
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,631
As for the flight, there's one at...

293
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,072
We shall be landing in LA
in 20 minutes.

294
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,714
Would all passengers

295
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,912
please remain seated...

296
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,717
You don't give a shit
about Aaron Ulrich now?

297
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,631
He's always been your idol.

298
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:20,959
I'm not saying I don't give a shit
about working with him.

299
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,755
Why else would I spend
20 hours on a train to Amsterdam?

300
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,789
He's the world's greatest living
writer-director.

301
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,118
But I don't want to work for him,
I'd like him to work for me.

302
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,309
You can call by here, right?
Come to Paris.

303
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,034
Come on, come to Paris.

304
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:42,154
Please...

305
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,235
Shit!

306
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:14,517
Snow started falling softly...

307
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,196
as light as candyfloss...

308
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,874
THE END

309
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,959
Read that chapter of "Moby Dick"?

310
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:19,035
Well done, sis, you'll be a writer.

311
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,194
Seen that, Alioscia?

312
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,675
Fuck it!

313
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,792
You're irresponsible.

314
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:02,237
Your first check-up
in five months of pregnancy.

315
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,992
Just tell me

316
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,032
if it's alive or dead.

317
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,117
It's alive and it's a girl.

318
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,638
My baby...

319
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,638
She's clenching her fists...

320
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:36,156
And you're both in prefect health.
Look at her.

321
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,956
Doctor, thank you.

322
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,038
Thank you, doctor.

323
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:51,310
Seven months.

324
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,950
You mean you're still going
on that Australian guy?

325
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:58,115
His name's Kirk.

326
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:03,152
I don't know.
He's never been in touch...

327
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,428
He's never called, I know it's over.

328
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,871
He's dumped me, okay.

329
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,597
I know his group's
playing the Cigale tonight.

330
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:17,268
The very place where I met him.

331
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,958
I'm going to surprise him.

332
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,077
God, Anna, surprises suck.

333
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,070
I'm sure it'll all go well.

334
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,114
I'm sure
he'll knock me out tonight.

335
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,155
You always make me late.
Fuck, it's already started.

336
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,679
It'll all be okay.

337
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,633
Love isn't always poison
as Bob Dylan said.

338
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,671
Or my mom. I forget now.

339
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,231
God, he's so good-looking!
It's just like last year.

340
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,079
- Go on.
- Really?

341
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,713
Come with me?

342
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,912
Go on your own, everything's okay.

343
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:26,916
Let go!

344
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:25,800

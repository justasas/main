1
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,605
How often do I
have to tell you...

2
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,475
that Sophia Frederica
is no longer to play with toys.

3
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,112
She's almost seven now.
Don't smoke in here. The child is sick.

4
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:58,140
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous
marriage someday, and you undo everything.

5
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,822
How am I to make it clear to you that
Sophia might one day become a queen?

6
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:06,091
I don't want to be a queen, Mother.
I want to be a toe dancer.

7
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,662
Be quiet, Sophia. You're going to marry
a king if I have anything to do with it.

8
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,398
Stick out your tongue,
Your Highness, and say "ahh. "

9
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,391
Ahh.

10
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,306
Not as bad as I thought.
We'll build her a nice harness,

11
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,540
and she'll have to wear it
for about a year.

12
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:25,878
Put those toys away.
I don't want to see them again!

13
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:29,182
You'll grow up to be
a tall and beautiful woman.

14
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:32,530
I must be off
on one of my operations.

15
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:35,844
Don't let them frighten you, darling.

16
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,895
"A nice harness"!
What is he, a horse doctor?

17
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,923
You flatter him. Our learned medico is going
to perform one of his operations with an axe.

18
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:51,569
- He's the public hangman.
- Hangman?

19
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:54,873
What's a hangman?
Can I become a hangman someday?

20
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:58,611
A hangman is an executioner,
the man who takes heads off skillfully.

21
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:02,215
Sometimes that profession
becomes the sport of titles.

22
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,182
I was about to read to you...

23
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,818
<i>of Peter the Great
and Ivan the Terrible,</i>

24
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,846
<i>and other Russian tsars
and tsarinas who were hangmen.</i>

25
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,393
<i>[Bell Bonging]</i>

26
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,956
Stop walking, August.
You make me nervous.

27
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:09,409
<i>[Girl]
Your Highness! Your Highness!</i>

28
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:12,710
<i>Your Highness!</i>

29
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,543
Your Highness,
a letter from the king.

30
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:20,342
<i>Your father wishes
to see you at once.</i>

31
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,442
Sit down, my child.

32
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:47,480
We have been honored with
a communication from His Majesty...

33
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:51,473
which concerns you principally.

34
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,760
"We, by Divine Grace Frederick,
king of Prussia,

35
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,928
<i>"have, after a series
of negotiations,</i>

36
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:07,956
"decided to honor your family
by selecting your daughter,

37
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,437
<i>"Sophia Frederica
to forthwith set out for Russia...</i>

38
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:16,465
<i>"and there to become the bride of
His Serene Highness, Peter Feodorovich,</i>

39
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,913
<i>"grandson of Peter the Great,
nephew of Her Imperial Majesty,</i>

40
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,748
"and heir presumptive
to the throne.

41
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,386
<i>" Within the week,
an emissary will arrive...</i>

42
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,887
"to escort your daughter
and her mother,

43
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,325
<i>"Princess Johanna Elizabeth,
to the court at Moscow.</i>

44
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,729
"Please inform her
that she is to follow dutifully...

45
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,464
"the advice of
Her Majesty's ambassador...

46
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,330
"and extend to her,
as well as to your entire family,

47
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:47,162
my fond greetings and affections.
Fredericus Rex. "

48
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,676
Grand duchess of Russia!
Not bad for this family.

49
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,377
I wonder what he looks like.

50
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,848
That unimportant detail can be settled
when the ambassador gets here.

51
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:58,863
Come, August,
we shall reply to the king at once.

52
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:01,843
One must strike while the iron's hot.
Come with me.

53
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:47,189
This is the countess Cecilia,
a cousin on my mother's side.

54
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,594
and this is her sister, Maria,
and this...

55
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,938
Your Highness
may now come down.

56
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,882
This is Count Alexei,
field marshal of the Russian Army,

57
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,849
grand master of the hunt,

58
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,953
lord of the chamber
and ambassador extraordinary...

59
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,223
from Her Divine Majesty,
Elizabeth of Russia.

60
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:48,216
This is my daughter Sophia.

61
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,291
Although for a long time we've heard
about your beauty, Your Highness,

62
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,729
I must confess, I was not prepared
to see such a vision of loveliness.

63
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,799
<i>Her Majesty instructed me to present a
few gifts as evidence of her graciousness.</i>

64
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,612
Come here.

65
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,249
This pipe is for you,
Prince August.

66
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:14,965
These sables are to keep
your shoulders warm.

67
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,647
These gloves are
to keep your hands warm.

68
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,918
This robe is to keep
your feet warm.

69
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,681
These hot-water bottles,

70
00:09:25,716 --> 00:09:28,199
to keep Mother warm.

71
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,153
<i>Is it then still so cold
in Russia, Your Excellency?</i>

72
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:34,627
Indeed, Your Highness,
the rivers are still frozen,

73
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:38,066
and will be until some time
after we've arrived.

74
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,317
Her Majesty also asked me to give you
this token of her esteem.

75
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,118
Convey to her
my profoundest thanks.

76
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,139
Isn't Her Majesty beautiful!
How long will the journey take?

77
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:53,125
If weather permits,
we should reach Moscow in seven weeks,

78
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,159
where Her Majesty
is impatiently awaiting us.

79
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:59,187
- And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun?
- The day after tomorrow,

80
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,634
unless it is the desire
of this charming young lady...

81
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,101
to leave at once to meet
her anxious bridegroom.

82
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:06,973
- Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke?
- I'm sorry, I did not.

83
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:09,240
- Would you like him to be handsome?
- Isn't he?

84
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,678
Would you like him to be better looking
than all men, tall and gracious?

85
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:16,671
- Yes, I think I would.
- Well, he is all that and more.

86
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:20,976
He's the handsomest man in the Russian
court, tall and formed like a Greek god,

87
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,658
a model in fashion and deportment
which all of us strive to follow.

88
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:27,711
<i>- Are you eager to see him?
- Yes.</i>

89
00:10:27,746 --> 00:10:29,838
<i>His eyes are like the blue sky,</i>

90
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:31,896
his hair the color of ebony.

91
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,265
He is stronger
than a team of oxen,

92
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,293
and sleepless because of his desire
to receive you in his arms.

93
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,005
And he can also read and write.

94
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,710
So can my daughter. She can cook and
sew and make her own bed if she has to.

95
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:48,703
<i>- Can't you, Sophia?
- But I don't like to make my own bed, Mother.</i>

96
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,841
- Don't speak unless you're questioned.
- You did question me, Mother.

97
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,323
Say good night, and go back
to your room and go to sleep.

98
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:59,709
Good night, Father.

99
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:02,026
Good night, Sophia.

100
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,914
Good night, Your Excellency.

101
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:07,642
Good night,
my little princess.

102
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,940
- Good night, Mother.
- Good night.

103
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:12,204
- Good night, Auntie.
- Good night.

104
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:20,135
<i>- Good night.
- Good night.</i>

105
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:46,261
This is unexpected.
Your daughter is extremely charming...

106
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,275
and will be by far the most beautiful
woman at Her Majesty's court.

107
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,128
I'd be grateful if you
were not to turn her head.

108
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:54,947
She's been brought up
carefully, is unspoilt,

109
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:58,940
and I've taught her
not to flirt.

110
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,757
You're going on a far journey,
and I may never see you again.

111
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,170
Remember what I've taught you.

112
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,005
Always to be honest and truthful;

113
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,033
to be a faithful wife and a loyal
subject of your new country.

114
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:03,082
Be kind to those who
are in your service...

115
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:06,117
and obedient to your
husband and superiors,

116
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:10,145
and strive at all times
to be worthy of your glorious destiny.

117
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,137
Another day like this,
and I'll fall apart.

118
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,108
When I return, I'll complain to the king
about the state of his roads.

119
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:38,108
The roads are bad, aren't they?

120
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:41,447
When we reach the border, there will
be snow and we shall change to sleds.

121
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,483
Your rooms are ready, Your Royal
Highness. Can I show them to you?

122
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:48,476
Yes, you may.
I'm prepared for the worst.

123
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,937
Is the journey proving
too much for you too?

124
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:07,206
Oh, no.
It could go on forever...

125
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:11,199
if Mother didn't mind.

126
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,433
Be careful with that knife.
You'll cut your beautiful hand.

127
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:38,426
Your hand is beautiful,
isn't it?

128
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:45,978
- Why did you do that?
- Because I've fallen in love with you.

129
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:49,971
Now you may punish me
for my effrontery.

130
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,384
I deserve punishment
far more than you do.

131
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,412
We must never do this again.
It's disloyal to my future husband.

132
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,058
Disloyal? It's treason,
and I must be careful in the future,

133
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:04,430
but you must help me by not exciting me
with your beautiful eyes.

134
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:08,423
I told you not to look at me.

135
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:15,307
What are you two doing?
Don't answer me. I don't want to know.

136
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,555
<i>Sophia, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.</i>

137
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,769
<i>You will instantly
follow me to our rooms.</i>

138
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:29,282
Incidentally, our rooms are beneath
all contempt, Your Excellency.

139
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:33,114
The stables are probably better
than the quarters assigned to us.

140
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,060
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
If you prefer the stables,

141
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,430
I can arrange to have the horses
quartered in your bedroom.

142
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,597
Barbarian!

143
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:44,625
You're going to sleep
in my room tonight.

144
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:10,451
[Bugle Call]

145
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,201
It is cold. At least you have something
to warm you when you get to Moscow;

146
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,639
That is, if your husband
isn't completely made of ice.

147
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,787
A basket of fruit
with Her Majesty's compliments,

148
00:18:08,822 --> 00:18:11,188
and these flowers
from the grand duke,

149
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:15,216
who instructed me to ride day and night
for a week to be here in time.

150
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,866
<i> [Bells Chiming]</i>

151
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,480
[Cheering]

152
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,322
[Chiming]

153
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:50,678
[Chiming]

154
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:09,630
<i> [Bells Chiming]</i>

155
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,034
Welcome home, Your Excellency.

156
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:13,027
We've missed you.

157
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,645
So, this is Little Sophie,
Sophia Frederica.

158
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,679
Hardly a name for a future empress.

159
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:26,334
- You don't like your name, do you?
- I do, Your Majesty.

160
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,920
You will be called Catherine Alexina,
a good Russian name.

161
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,323
We've arranged a special ceremony
to receive you into our church.

162
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:36,528
<i>- Haven't we, Simeon?
- Yes, little mother, we've arranged a ceremony.</i>

163
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:40,521
Come here.

164
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,067
So, this is the mother.
You've raised a pretty child.

165
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:47,873
Your Majesty, I've come to lay at your
feet feelings of the deepest gratitude...

166
00:21:47,908 --> 00:21:50,974
<i>for the benefactions which your bounty
has heaped upon my house,</i>

167
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:55,013
<i>and of which many instances are given me
at every step I take into your realms.</i>

168
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:57,381
<i>[Empress]
Tush, tush! A pretty speech.</i>

169
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,617
<i>What I have done is nothing
in comparison with what I shall do.</i>

170
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,955
<i>- My own blood is no more dear to me than yours.
- Is that the grand duke?</i>

171
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,948
Shh.

172
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:13,365
This is the order of St. Catherine.
May you both wear it in good health.

173
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,735
Be careful it doesn't scratch you.
Pin this on Catherine.

174
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,735
What do you think of Catherine?

175
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,104
I can only admire
your judgment, Your Majesty.

176
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,132
That's the chancellor. Steals more money
in a week than I collect in taxes in a year.

177
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:30,414
<i>Doctor, come here.</i>

178
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:33,719
What do you think of my taste in women?
Looks healthy, doesn't she?

179
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,621
Just what we need
to breed sons for Russia.

180
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:40,614
With your permission,
Your Highness.

181
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,765
- How was the journey? Comfortable?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,935
Are you happy to be here?

183
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,035
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,063
- Are you going to love your new country?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

185
00:22:56,641 --> 00:23:00,477
- Do you promise to be a loyal subject?
- Yes, Your Majesty.

186
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:04,505
Don't make too many new friends, and no
intrigue and gossip. I have my hands full now.

187
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,988
Perfect, Your Majesty.
She will give us no trouble.

188
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:13,981
Your Highness.

189
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,893
Someday I'll have every doctor
thrown out of the country.

190
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,532
Catherine, before you go to your rooms,
is there any wish I can grant you?

191
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,525
I would like to see
the grand duke.

192
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:32,199
His Imperial Highness,
Grand Duke Peter.

193
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:08,169
That's a fine way to receive your bride! I
suppose you had more important things to do.

194
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:12,239
<i>I told you to be on time.
Go on, kiss each other.</i>

195
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:18,245
<i>Remember, Catherine,
the first child must be a boy.</i>

196
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:23,695
<i>That's why we had you brought here, to
provide Russia with an heir to the throne.</i>

197
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,688
<i>A fine, bouncing, healthy heir.
You understand me, Catherine?</i>

198
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,499
<i>[Alexei]
These are your ladies-in-waiting.</i>

199
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:05,504
They represent illustrious houses
of our most important domains.

200
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,471
Step forward, Natacha.

201
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,775
She is the daughter
of Prince Dolgoruki.

202
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,877
<i>Natacha, come here.</i>

203
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:17,905
This is your mistress of the wardrobe.
She has charge of the beds and laces.

204
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:29,149
I must show her
my new invention.

205
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,778
I'm in a hurry.
I must witness an execution.

206
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,303
<i>[Alexei] I suggest that
you wait in the next room.</i>

207
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:41,288
Perhaps I shouldn't
have lied to you.

208
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,626
Forgive me, won't you?

209
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:03,288
His Imperial Highness
sent me for his soldiers.

210
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:07,281
I hope I haven't
disturbed you.

211
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,022
That's Countess Varonsoff. She's always
picking up the grand duke's soldiers,

212
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:20,060
which I'm beginning to suspect
he leaves intentionally.

213
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,696
Don't bother. Don't bother.
Go on with your work.

214
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:33,434
Doesn't Sophia, I mean, Catherine, look
beautiful? I always forget the new name.

215
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,597
Just see what's
being done to her hair!

216
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,182
That's exactly what
I'm looking at.

217
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,487
How's she going to wear the headdress?
Where is the headdress?

218
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:46,480
- Where is the headdress?
- Where's the headdress?

219
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,367
We must make you very beautiful,
Catherine, very, very beautiful...

220
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,035
so that my nephew
will fall in love with you.

221
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,841
I expect you two to behave like love birds
so Russia will have an heir to the throne.

222
00:29:02,876 --> 00:29:06,834
Remember, I want a boy, not a girl.
Nothing less than a boy will do.

223
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:11,214
We don't want any more women
on the throne.

224
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,242
But Your Majesty, what would we
have done if you had been born a boy?

225
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,747
I would have had less trouble in Russia
if I'd been born a man instead of woman.

226
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,927
We women are too much creatures
of the heart, aren't we, Catherine?

227
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:26,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

228
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,939
<i> [Indistinct Singing]</i>

241
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:49,832
Your Imperial Majesty,

242
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:53,860
before the bridal pair retire,
I wish to propose a toast...

243
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:58,025
to Her Imperial Highness,
the grand duchess Catherine.

244
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:01,611
May our new bride from far away
be forever happy...

245
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:05,449
and learn to know the love we have
in our Russian hearts for her...

246
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:08,886
and the hope this vast,
imperishable empire has...

247
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:12,879
for an heir to the throne.

248
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:19,386
[Glasses Crashing]

249
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,053
You have made me
very happy today, Catherine,

250
00:38:31,088 --> 00:38:34,701
and i hope you will continue
to make me happy.

251
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,083
Now, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired.

252
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:42,320
And I know that most of you...

253
00:38:42,355 --> 00:38:46,313
are...

254
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,785
are also very tired.

255
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:37,430
[Chiming]

256
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,483
May I inquire how Her Imperial Highness
deigns to feel this morning?

257
00:41:37,294 --> 00:41:41,265
[Panting] Her Highness feels
as well as can be expected...

258
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,701
after her romantic marriage.

259
00:41:43,736 --> 00:41:46,068
And how is His Excellency?

260
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:50,096
His Excellency is distressed because
you've been avoiding him for an eternity.

261
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,133
[Sighs]

262
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,197
<i>- I haven't been avoiding you.
- You have.</i>

263
00:41:57,232 --> 00:41:59,748
I've tried again and again
to see you alone...

264
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:03,203
<i>- and you've made it impossible.
- If you must know,</i>

265
00:42:03,238 --> 00:42:06,589
I haven't had enough time
to recover from the shock...

266
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:10,617
of finding my husband a trifle different
than you described him.

267
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,298
I had a duty to my country
and a loyalty to my sovereign.

268
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:17,835
Had I described
the grand duke correctly,

269
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,768
you might not have come here.

270
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:23,796
I would have obeyed my mother
even if you had told the truth.

271
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:27,776
How could I have known of such
a degree of filial respect?

272
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,915
Anyway, I would have taken no chances,
because from the moment I saw you,

273
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,249
- I wanted you to come to Russia.
- Please, be careful.

274
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:37,277
- My husband will be told.
- Your husband doesn't mean a thing to you.

275
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:39,588
He does. I'll always
be faithful to him.

276
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:42,293
Those ideas are old-fashioned.
This is the eighteenth century.

277
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:46,286
But I'm not a Russian.
I'm going now.

278
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:50,317
I told you I wanted to see you alone.
I won't wait any longer.

279
00:42:50,352 --> 00:42:53,003
I'll be at the stables tomorrow
when you go for your ride.

280
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:55,037
Maybe I won't care to ride anymore.

281
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,175
- I'll be there, and you'd better be there too.
- I will not!

282
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,168
Furthermore, I'm going
to tell my mother all about you.

283
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:07,307
<i>One moment more,
Your Imperial Highness.</i>

284
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,844
On the reverse side of this miniature
is a diamond. Don't lose the diamond.

285
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,928
What are you doing here
sneaking around like a ghost?

286
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:54,827
<i>- I hate my wife.
- You hate your wife?</i>

287
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:58,691
You've only been married
for a week. Why?

288
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,272
You'll make a fine emperor
someday, you idiot!

289
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,342
You can't force a woman to be sweet
to you. She's only a child!

290
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:09,813
Be patient with her. You know our people
are waiting for you to raise a family.

291
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:12,915
- They don't care whether you like her.
- I don't want her.

292
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:16,186
I picked her for your wife, and your
wife she will remain as long as I live.

293
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:19,423
<i>Get that into your skull.
I don't want to hear any more about it.</i>

294
00:44:19,458 --> 00:44:23,416
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

295
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,911
Her Majesty is waiting for you
in the council chamber.

296
00:44:40,946 --> 00:44:42,878
- War with Finland?
- Yes, Your Excellency.

297
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,382
- How is Her Majesty?
- The last few days she's turned sour,

298
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:49,375
like milk that's been
standing too long.

299
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,131
Your Highness is
so happy this morning.

300
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:05,797
- You can't be going to see your husband.
- Dear me, my husband!

301
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:09,429
I'd forgotten I have a husband.
No, I'm not going to see my husband.

302
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:15,079
If Your Highness were not so new to our court,
I'd suspect you were going to see your lover.

303
00:45:15,114 --> 00:45:19,072
Lover?
And what may a lover be?

304
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,153
A lover's a man, not a husband, who loves you
with all his heart and whom you love in return.

305
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:27,146
But, Marie, that's wicked.
Don't tell me that you have a lover!

306
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:31,026
<i>I wish I had. Here, everyone
has a lover, everyone but me.</i>

307
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:35,054
Oh, Marie, not everyone. Her Exalted
Majesty can't possibly have a lover.

308
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,000
What about the young man
who's always with her?

309
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,338
Why do you suppose she leans on him so
heavily? Because she's weak in the knees?

310
00:45:41,373 --> 00:45:45,007
Oh, how shocking! If anyone
should hear us! Go on, get my dress.

311
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:49,035
Your highness won't tell anyone.
The empress is a devil when she's angry.

312
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:53,048
Of course I won't tell anyone,
nor do I believe such nonsense.

313
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,954
Neither have I a lover. I'm happy
because I'm going to see my mother.

314
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,822
- Your mother? I thought you knew.
- Knew what?

315
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,993
Your mother left for Germany.
Her carriage set out at midnight.

316
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:05,127
- You must be joking.
- I'm not joking.

317
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,510
Her Majesty ordered her
to return immediately.

318
00:46:08,545 --> 00:46:11,858
But she didn't say good-bye.
That's not possible.

319
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:31,588
Her Majesty's in council.
No one's allowed to enter.

320
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,581
No order in this palace
is intended for me.

321
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,414
Why did you send my mother away?
What wrong had she done?

322
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,915
I don't remember sending for you.

323
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:02,384
<i>I want to know why
you sent my mother away.</i>

324
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:05,817
<i>[Empress] You presume to question
me? Who do you think you are,</i>

325
00:47:05,852 --> 00:47:09,215
bursting into a conference as
though the palace were on fire?

326
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:12,996
You want to know why
I sent your mother away.

327
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,963
Well, I'll tell you why.

328
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:17,901
I sent your mother away because
she didn't bring you up properly.

329
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:21,104
I was told you were an obedient,
respectful child.

330
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:23,138
You're nothing of the sort!

331
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,543
Why do you think I had you brought from
Germany? To give you these pearls?

332
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:29,613
Or to make you a grand duchess
of the Holy Russian Empire?

333
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:32,147
I had you brought here
to be an obedient wife...

334
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:36,175
and to supply my country with
a much-needed heir to the throne.

335
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:43,310
Take Her Imperial Highness,
the grand duchess,

336
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:45,594
and turn her over
to my mistress of the robes...

337
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,399
with instructions that from this minute on
she's to be attached to my personal staff...

338
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:53,168
where I can keep her under my eye,
where I can educate her and teach her...

339
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:56,073
<i>what it means to be a Russian wife and
how to accept the embraces of a husband...</i>

340
00:47:56,108 --> 00:47:58,040
<i>like a Russian wife!</i>

341
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:02,068
<i>Now, get out, both of you.
I have a war on my hands.</i>

342
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,916
Looking for someone?

343
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,451
Oh, you frightened me.

344
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:45,153
[Whispering]
I've only a minute. I ran away.

345
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:49,181
I came down to tell you
not to wait. I must go now.

346
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,153
Is that all you came to tell me?

347
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:05,364
What else is there to tell?

348
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,250
If you come closer,
I'll scream.

349
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,270
It will be easier for you to scream
without a straw in your mouth.

350
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,700
[Whinnies]

351
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,400
Get up! Get up!

352
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,570
Why are there six places?
What's the occasion?

353
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:45,600
You asked me to arrange a dinner for the
French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives.

354
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:49,350
Tell them to come for breakfast. I never
did like these diplomatic functions.

355
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,340
- They lead to nothing.
- I quite agree, Your Majesty.

356
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,690
<i>[Chair Scratching Floor]</i>

357
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:06,720
Don't any of you think I'm going to eat
with a lot of dried-up mummies every night.

358
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,420
Boris, sit down there.

359
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:11,940
Alexander, sit over there.

360
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,940
You, sit there.

361
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,940
Michael!

362
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,440
- Your Majesty.
- Catherine.

363
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,410
Take his toys.

364
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:25,420
Michael, sit there.
Paul!

365
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,590
- Your Majesty.
- Oh, go on. Sit down.

366
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:32,610
Now, the rest of you get out.
Get out! Get out!

367
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,240
- The pig, Your Majesty.
- Put it down and don't make so much fuss about it.

368
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,640
The way you handle that pig, you'd think
it was the only one in Russia.

369
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,740
- The wine, Your Majesty.
- Fill the glasses and get out.

370
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,510
What are you pouting for?
You're not jealous of Paul, are you?

371
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:57,250
He isn't jealous of you. You look
exhausted, Paul. What's the matter?

372
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,390
I'm tired. My wife gave birth
to a child yesterday.

373
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:04,380
<i>- Boy or girl?
- A boy, beloved empress.</i>

374
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,840
<i>What the wife of a guard can do should
certainly be easy for a grand duchess.</i>

375
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,720
<i>Remind me to give you a purse of gold
tomorrow. Those of you who have boys,</i>

376
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,600
<i>raise your hands.
Exactly what I thought!</i>

377
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,630
<i>A few more like you, and Russia
need never worry about her enemies.</i>

378
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:25,780
What's this, Alexei?
Sending notes to the grand duchess?

379
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,910
Do you want me
to send you into exile?

380
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,880
Or shall I tell the grand duchess
that you're a notorious heartbreaker...

381
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,920
and have broken every woman's heart
in this court, including mine?

382
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:38,950
You're very flattering, Imperial Majesty,
but the note contains nothing of importance.

383
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,930
Then suppose you read it.

384
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,930
"We are all very much disturbed
over your conduct...

385
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,960
and wish you would change your behavior
so that Her Majesty might forgive you. "

386
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,270
Who else can read here?

387
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,870
You read it, Catherine.
I know you can read...

388
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,900
because my reports say you foolishly
spend your time in bed reading books!

389
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:12,350
"We are all very much upset at,
uh, uh...

390
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,350
"at... and hope...
you will behave better...

391
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,130
so that you may be
forgiven by the empress. "

392
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,130
<i>Send for the chancellor!</i>

393
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:42,420
- Your Imperial Majesty?
- Read this for me.

394
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,390
"You must help me
to see you alone again.

395
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:48,060
"You are being watched so closely
that all my efforts to meet you...

396
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,260
for a few precious seconds
are in vain. "

397
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,400
So, you're up to
your old tricks again!

398
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,730
Right under my nose too.
Well, forget about her.

399
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,900
she's reserved for my nephew and being
taught how to earn his love first...

400
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,870
before wasting her favors on others.

401
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,910
Go back to your dinner. It's the first
time you've been of use to me in a year.

402
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:08,480
As for you, look after my friends
and see that they're fed well.

403
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,470
Did you hear what I said?

404
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,610
<i>[Empress] Sit down, you fools,
or I'll send you to Siberia.</i>

405
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,790
<i>She may be a grand duchess
to the rest of the world,</i>

406
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,820
<i>but in here she's being taught
how to be a Russian wife!</i>

407
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:01,020
Catherine, where are you?
Take off my boots!

408
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,170
Go outside and send the others away.
Everybody!

409
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,160
I want to be alone tonight.

410
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,070
Her Majesty wishes
to be alone tonight.

411
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:26,250
You wouldn't think that once
I had skin like velvet.

412
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,520
Empress, bah! I haven't even the power
to iron out a single wrinkle.

413
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,690
What are you looking at?

414
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:51,980
That must be Peter.

415
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,010
Go see if it is, and tell him
to come here at once.

416
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,890
Your Imperial Highness,
Her Majesty wishes to see you at once.

417
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,670
What the devil do you mean
poking holes in my bedroom?

418
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,990
I wanted to watch my wife.

419
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:34,260
Watching your wife won't give you
an heir to the throne.

420
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:37,830
The next time I catch you providing
my rooms with needless ventilation,

421
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:39,800
I'll have you flogged.

422
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:43,820
I'll catch my death of a draft someday! Go
back to your rooms and wait for your wife.

423
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,530
This is your fault. I had hoped by bringing
you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit!

424
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,070
[Knocking]

425
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,520
Sorry to intrude, Your Majesty.

426
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:05,090
I think the grand duke dropped
one of his soldiers in here.

427
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,100
Thank you.
Good night.

428
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,080
Wait a minute.
Come here.

429
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,240
How long have you been at this court
picking up soldiers?

430
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,200
Two years and a half,
Your Majesty.

431
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,610
I fail to recall your exact duties here,
Countess Elizabeth.

432
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,650
I'm in charge of entertainment for
His Imperial Highness, the grand duke.

433
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,750
Exactly how far is it
to your home, Lizzie?

434
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,380
My ancestral home is in
the province of Astrakhan,

435
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,320
about two weeks' journey from Moscow.

436
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:40,350
Not as far as I had hoped. His Imperial
Highness has been entertained long enough.

437
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:44,380
Do you understand me? I don't want
to see you around again. Get out.

438
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:53,000
She won't snoop
around here anymore.

439
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,030
I should have thrown her out
before I had you brought here.

440
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,690
Come here, Catherine.
Sit down.

441
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,790
Haven't you given me
trouble enough?

442
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,000
Are you going to behave
like an obedient wife...

443
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,970
<i>or must I continue to treat you
like a stubborn child?</i>

444
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,200
I don't care
what you do with me.

445
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,800
You might change
your mind about that.

446
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:31,740
You're in love with His Excellency,
Count Alexei, aren't you?

447
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,250
No, Your Majesty, I'm not.

448
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,350
I'm not.

449
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:38,380
It's a good thing you're not.

450
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:42,120
I wouldn't advise you
to become my rival.

451
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,110
Rival? What does
Your Majesty mean?

452
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:50,380
You will find out soon. In the
meantime, you can blow out the candles.

453
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,460
<i>[Empress]
Before you retire...</i>

454
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,080
you can be of one more service.

455
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:08,340
<i>[Chiming]</i>

456
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:12,370
<i>Behind my mirror, a concealed passage
will lead you down...</i>

457
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,350
<i>a flight of stairs
to another door.</i>

458
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:19,690
<i>behind that door you will find
someone waiting to come up.</i>

459
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,680
<i>I don't want him
to see you, so be careful.</i>

460
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,950
[Clock Chiming]

461
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,910
<i>- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night, Catherine.</i>

462
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:41,940
And you don't need to report
for duty until late tomorrow.

463
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,400
<i>Halt!
Who goes there?</i>

464
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,400
- Nobody.
- Just a minute, my little hen.

465
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,430
That's not the password.
You'd better think up another one.

466
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:03,480
Come to the guardhouse,
and we'll find out who you are.

467
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:07,520
You're entirely too good-looking
to be running around like this.

468
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:09,950
What are you hiding back there?

469
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,240
Take your hands off me,
you insolent fool!

470
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:14,460
I'm Catherine,
grand duchess of Russia.

471
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,490
Don't take advantage of me.
This is my first night on duty.

472
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:20,670
The grand duchess isn't permitted
out at night. Tell me who you are.

473
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:23,070
I told you who I am.

474
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,070
Oh, come now.
Stop joking.

475
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,610
If you're the grand duchess,
then I'm the grand duke.

476
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:29,640
I wish you were!

477
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,480
if i were the grand duke and
you were the grand duchess,

478
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,280
I wouldn't let you prowl
through the night like this,

479
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:39,270
like a pretty little kitten.

480
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:48,280
Suppose I didn't want to tell you
who I really am. What would happen?

481
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,030
On a night like this,
anything might happen...

482
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,000
if I'm fortunate.

483
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,640

Have you noticed, Your Majesty,

491
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:41,570
how the imperial duckling
resembles his father?

Hush, hush, enough of this.

<i>Now, you keep an eye on him.</i>

495
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:52,520
I don't want anyone near him unless
I know about it, not even his mother.

496
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:55,050
I had enough trouble getting him.

497
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:59,080

or sniffles just once,

498

I'll have you
hung by the ears!

499
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:03,490
If he coughs,
I'll have you cut in half!

500
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,160
And if anyone touches him,
I'll have you shot!

01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,760
Your Majesty, I beg of you
not to become excited.

You've been ill for weeks.
This turmoil will weaken you.

on so glorious an event.

511
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,530

Tell me about it some other time.

to present to you as a sign...

Your Excellency,
what can I do for you?

526
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,960
Will you please ask
Her Highness once more...

527
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,400
- if she will grant me an audience?
- I'm sorry, Your Excellency,

528
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,410
we have orders from Her Highness
not even to mention your name to her.

529

Then perhaps you will
convey to Her Highness...

530
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,410
that I've been waiting
for some time now to congratulate her...

531
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:11,440
on the great historic event of providing our
country with a much-needed heir to the throne.

532
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,720
I'm certain that history was far from
her mind at the time, Your Excellency.

534
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,050
Her Majesty is very ill,
and her days are numbered.

535

Soon she will be no more,
poor soul,

536
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:50,610
and another maniac
will become our emperor.

537
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,050
It will be a bad day for Russia,
and for me if I live that long.

538
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,100
Why are you telling this to me?

539
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:04,120
You know that the grand duke isn't exactly
pleased with the present state of affairs.

540

State of affairs?

541
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:10,710
What affairs? I haven't
had an affair for some time.

542
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:14,750
I know that the grand duke plans
to remove you from court...

543

I have no wish to share
in any petty conspiracy.

Should it become unavoidable,
I think I have weapons...

than any political machine.

Her Majesty doesn't
know anything about it,

01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,970
But I'm completely bewildered
by your attitude towards me.

652
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,540
However, I've become accustomed
to regard you...

653
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,560
as one of those
extraordinary women...

654
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:45,510
<i>who create their
own laws and logic.</i>

655
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:49,530
<i>and now I'm concerned
only with your safety.</i>

656
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:56,420
Is it my safety
that concerns you...

657
01:25:56,450 --> 01:26:00,410
or the safety of an empress?

658
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,590
I would give my life if the woman I adore
were not so far removed from me in station.

659
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,590
The woman you adore is quite
close to you, isn't she?

660
01:26:15,910 --> 01:26:19,900
Catherine,
I love you, worship you.

661
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:41,500
I asked you here tonight because
I want you to do something for me.

662
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:45,500
I can trust you, can't I?
We'll always be friends, won't we?

663
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,500
Yes, Your Majesty.
What is it you require?

664
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:52,500
Blow out the candles.

665
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:17,500
Behind the mirror, as you know,
there's a flight of stairs.

666
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:21,040
Down below, someone
is waiting to come up.

667
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:25,060
Will His Excellency be kind enough
to open the door for him carefully...

668
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:29,530
so that he can sneak in?

669
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,580
Her Majesty is waiting
for you, Captain.

670
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:10,820
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

671
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:14,120
Will you deliver
a message for me, Captain?

672
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:16,390
I would be very glad to, sir.

673
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:20,430
Tell Her Majesty that
I quite understand now.

674
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:23,600
No, never mind.
Don't tell her anything.

675
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:27,590
- She'll know.
- Yes, sir.

676
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:07,770
Something for the poor,
Your Majesty?

677
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:36,630
For the poor, Captain?

678
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,920
Excellency?

679
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:00,950
Quite a haul tonight, father.

680
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:09,960
Chancellor?

681
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:20,810
Elizabeth?

682
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,950
Your Imperial Majesty,
something for the poor?

683
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:43,210
That was for me.
Now what have you got for the poor?

684
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:47,200
There are no poor in Russia!
Get out!

685
01:31:12,740 --> 01:31:15,240
I've had enough of this
sanctimonious talk.

686
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:17,200
Let us drink.

687
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:19,810
Why doesn't he take up
his collections in church?

688
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,810
To the most charming
woman in my empire,

689
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:26,810
my friend,
the countess Elizabeth.

690
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:43,790
Go ask Her Majesty, my wife,
why she doesn't join our toast.

691
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,670
His Majesty, the emperor of Russia,
wishes me to ask...

692
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,810
why Her Majesty refuses
to join the toast.

693
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:56,840
Tell His Majesty that my thirst
is not as great as his tonight.

694
01:32:00,150 --> 01:32:03,850
Her Majesty wishes me to convey that her
thirst is not as great as his tonight.

695
01:32:03,890 --> 01:32:07,850
Go tell my wife she's a fool.

696
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:16,830
His Majesty wishes me
to inform Her Majesty...

697
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:20,830
that she is a fool.

698
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:49,300
What is your rank, Orloff?

699
01:32:49,330 --> 01:32:52,560
Captain, Your Majesty.

700
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,790
Well, you're nothing now.

701
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:04,200
Now get out, both of you,
and stay out!

702
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:25,800
Sit down!

703
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,800
My wife is not
to leave the palace.

704
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,830
She's under arrest
until further orders.

705
01:33:33,210 --> 01:33:37,090
Am I the emperor of Russia,
or am I not?

706
01:33:37,130 --> 01:33:40,970
We'll issue a proclamation
that she died...

707
01:33:43,120 --> 01:33:47,110
and ask the people
to pray for her.

708

[Clock Chiming]

709
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:35,860
Hurry, Your Majesty.
Everything is ready.

710
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:51,180
What are you doing here?

711
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,610
Halt!

712
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:51,710
Exit Peter III.

713
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:55,240
Enter Catherine II.

715
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:28,180
We, soldiers in the service
of the Holy Russian Empire,

716
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:32,180
do hereby solemnly swear
to acknowledge...

717
01:36:32,590 --> 01:36:36,580
and to defend with our lives,
the authority of Catherine our empress,

718
01:36:38,060 --> 01:36:40,530
and to destroy her enemies!

719

Hooray!

720
01:36:42,600 --> 01:36:48,960
Hooray!

721
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:18,330
Your Majesty, we're
sorry to trouble you,

722
01:37:18,370 --> 01:37:21,940
But Her Majesty isn't in here, is she?
She's no longer in her rooms.

723
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:25,960
You infernal blockhead! This is the last
place in the world she would come to.

724
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:29,240
Double the guard!
Surround the palace!

725
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:32,240
Find her
and bring her here to me!

[Trumpets, Drum Roll]

727
01:39:49,790 --> 01:39:52,450
God grant you victory,
Catherine.

728

All Russia is waiting
for the sound of our bell.

[Bell Ringing]

730
01:40:36,830 --> 01:40:40,830
Why are those bells ringing?

731
01:40:59,290 --> 01:41:01,290
Why are those bells ringing?

732
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:03,260
I don't know, Peter.

733
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:07,290
How dare you address me like that!
Who are you?

734
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,570
My name is Orloff,
and I'm on duty as guard.

735
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,570
I'll have your head
for this insolence!

736
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:15,700
You're addressing the emperor!

737
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:18,670
There is no emperor.

738
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:22,700
there is only an empress.

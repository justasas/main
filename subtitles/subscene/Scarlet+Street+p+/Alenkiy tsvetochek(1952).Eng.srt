00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,930
Father is here!

22
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,130
Tomorrow I leave on a long journey

23
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,470
When I will return I cannot say...

24
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,700
While I am away,
I want only one thing
from my daughters...

25
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,330
Listen to me , girls...

26
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,140
You must find a way to live
together... in peace...

27
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,780
...and harmony too, with
no bickering and no fighting.

28
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,810
Only love! If you do this one
thing for me...

29
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,550
I will bring you back anything you wish!

30
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,240
Whatever your heart desires!

31
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,170
So, tell me, what will you have
me bring you, dearest oldest.

32
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,980
Oh, Let me think. I want...a crown.

33
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,650
Like no one else has ever had.

34
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,120
Covered in jewels

35
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,090
Rubies and diamonds...Solid gold.

36
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:41,460
So people will say of me:
"Is she not beautiful".

37
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,870
You shall have your beautifull crown!

38
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,980
And what shall I bring back
for you, my pretty Liodushka?

39
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,990
I don't know. Not much...

40
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,730
Only a triffle i've heard about...
It's a magic mirror.

41
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,520
When you look into it, you are
forever young!

42
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,350
With it I will never look old,
and I will always be...

43
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,490
young and pretty...Ha ha

44
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,270
You will always look pretty to me.
Mirror, or not!

45
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,040
And...what of you...Nastinka?

46
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,040
What shall I bring for you? Tell me.

47
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,450
Once in a dream I saw it. A flower

48
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,270
Crimson red and peculiar, with
a sadness about it.

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,210
Ha, ha, ha. A sad flower
- Ridiculious.

50
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:55,060
Goodbye Nastinka. I will find you
your crimson flower. I promess.

51
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,370
I'll take it! My daughter will
be pleased!

52
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,560
What an unusual country this is!

53
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,050
Perhaps it's the place to find
Nastinka's flower.

54
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,710
Look there! Look at that!

55
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:51,040
Look over there. Stephen! look!

56
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:06,570
A crown of gold,covered with jewels
It's what she wanted!

57
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,380
All our goods are sold! We've
done well!

58
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,850
And our gifts are gathered!

59
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,080
It's time for us to go home!
Not quit.

60
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,480
I have no gift for Anastasia!

61
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,750
The crimson flower! It is what
I promised

62
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,050
Look stephen! look out there!

63
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,280
Fish that fly without wings!
Strange creatures that glow...

64
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,300
Perhaps we've reached the end
of the world!

65
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,930
It's time to turn back!
I cannot turn back...

66
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,020
I must find the crimson flower!

67
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,360
The sky is too clear!

68
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,770
A strong wind is with us!

69
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,210
Secure the mast!!!

70
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,430
Comrades, Pull,Pull!!!

71
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,230
Pull!

72
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,510
Stephen!!!

73
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:00,470
Stephen!! Dear Stephen, Were are you!!

74
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,900
Where am I? Where have I landed?

75
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:47,820
Where is my ship? My Crew?

76
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,780
This land is like none I've ever
seen! Let's go inland!

77
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,080
If there's a palace here, I'm
not alone here!

78
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,790
Ohh. A boat appears...Would it
be real?!

79
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,690
Is anyone here? ..yone here...ere?

80
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,250
Hello!!

81
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,470
Hello!

82
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,190
Is anyone here? Answer!
If you are there!

83
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,920
Perhaps I am alone after all!
Alone ....and hungry...

84
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,120
Well,...thank you!

85
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,220
Delicious soup!

86
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,640
And This? Ha,ha!

87
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:22,150
A toast to the master of the house!

88
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,370
Music! You think of everything!
Thank you!

89
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,470
I thank you for the meal.

90
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,300
What is this!?

91
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,130
The flower for my little one!

92
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,000
Ah! What have you done?!

93
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,890
How dare you take my greatest treasure
How dare you take my flower!

94
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,540
I welcomed you!

95
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,170
Gave you every comfort in the
whole of the world.

96
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,840
Yet, you repay me by taking my
greatest joy!

97
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,060
I didn't know.

98
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:14,040
Why did you take my precious flower?

99
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,970
For my youngest daughter.

100
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,960
Nastinka, if you please.

101
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,740
Your dearest? Nastinka?

102
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,310
What a kind and loving daughter
she must be...

103
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,080
For her...I will let you leave...
with the crimson flower.

104
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,880
but you must give your solemn promiss...

105
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,590
That one of your daughters will
return in your place!

106
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,750
Im my place? No, I cannot do that!

107
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:57,880
I will not harm her! She will
be well cared for!

108
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,490
Never!

109
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,560
You do not know a father's heart!

110
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:11,410
So be it!
Someone must pay for your transgression!

111
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,310
Or you must die!

112
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,360
I will give you a magic ring...

113
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,410
who ever places it on their finger
will instantly return to me.

114
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,250
You, or one of your daughters!!

115
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,660
Look there men! On that island!

116
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,900
There he is!

117
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,450
At last we have found our good captain!

118
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,990
look at me!!

119
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,930
Oh, come here! oh.

120
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,890
Get away now...

121
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,260
Let me have a chance to admire my
wonderful gift!

122
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,850
Wonderfull gift?

123
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,160
The flower of my dream!

124
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,930
The sweet crimson flower.

125
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,250
You must swear to me
with a solemn vow...

126
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,070
At sunrise i must put om the ring..

127
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,520
and return... to the terrible beast.

128
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:06,530
What?
- No stephen, don't go! You musn't!

129
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,140
I gave my word, my promis.
The ship is yours!

130
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,300
and I entrust you the care of my
beloved daughters.

131
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,600
Stephen! Dear Stephen!!

132
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,920
I made a promis.

133
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:23,290
I must pay the price
- Stephen!

134
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,200
Please, do as I ask!

135
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,310
Thake care of my home!

136
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,390
Be father to my children!

137
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:39,140
Especially...Nastinka!

138
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,900
What did you cause?You ugly
dream-flower!

139
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,770
It is not your fault, but mine!

140
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,410
And it's not you who should answer for it...but me!

141
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,290
My foolish request made you take the crimson flower!

142
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,620
Not you should pay the price!

143
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,400
Mastinka!

144
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,950
I beg you...

145
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,520
Forgive your foolish daughter!

146
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,570
Nastinka!!

147
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,840
I...brought you flower back.

148
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:13,630
Thank you, Nastinka.

149
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,540
Forgive me. I am sorry my father
took it!

150
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,910
Forgive you?

151
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,690
It was only for me that my father
took it.
My dreamflower!

152
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,910
I know. I  knew you'd come.

153
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,720
What? You knew I would? Do what you want
with me.

154
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,330
No. I don't want you to feel hurt.

155
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:48,310
No. I don't want you to feel hurt.
I want only for you
to stay here and feel well with me.

156
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,810
For me?

157
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,410
Can't be for me!

158
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,410
Can't be.

159
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,820
Thank you for your kindness.

160
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,740
But I prefer my own cloths.

161
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,020
They're simple... as I am

162
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,130
Very well

163
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,390
Nastinka

164
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,970
As you wish.

165
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,550
Come and view what's yours now

166
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,700
It is...

167
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,270
It is...

168
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,040
It is to be shared.

169
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:46,740
It's all yours.
Yours....and mine

170
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,380
Thank you for everything, invisible one.

171
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,560
It's all wonderful!...

172
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,450
but not for me...

173
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:04,410
what shall I do with the ring?
The ring? -It's yours!

174
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,800
It is not for me to keep you here!

175
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,030
You can go with it everywhere you want.

176
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,730
But remember....

177
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,660
your father promissed...

178
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,730
My heart would die without you.

179
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,350
So Nastinka didn't leave the island,
and settled in...

180
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,890
Sing for me my friend.

181
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,960
<i>I have everything that I could wish for</i>

182
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:17,610
<i>Satin dresses, golden treasures</i>

183
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:24,750
<i>Who could wish for more.</i>

184
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:32,940
<i>And I have one who says he'll
love forever</i>

185
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:55,140
<i>And we'll always be together,
still my heart's unsure</i>

186
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:02,860
<i>for I have memories that haunt me</i>

187
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,340
<i>But laughter so sweet and true</i>

188
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,570
<i>but all my health means nothing...</i>

189
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,990
<i>so far away from you</i>

190
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,730
I have frightened you Nashtinka!

191
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:00,830
Now you will leave me forever!

192
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,030
I did not mean to hurt you

193
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,320
You are my dearest friend.

194
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,570
Appear to me again.

195
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,700
and I swear by my heart...
I will not be frightened.

196
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,370
No, Nashtinka.

197
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:23,170
You are repulsed by the sight of me!

198
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,480
You have the power of the ring...

199
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:37,440
Use it ...and flee away from me!

200
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:42,800
And alone I will die of grief.

201
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,960
I'll promis, I will not leave

202
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,060
not if it would hurt you.

203
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:50,700
I'm contempt here.

204
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,320
and...I care for you...

205
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:00,970
Thank you, Nashtinka.
If only I could believe.

206
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,780
the platen apple...I did this as a child.

207
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:15,600
Roll, roll apple, spin round and round...
Roll along the silver plate

208
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:22,350
Show us snowy places far away.

209
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,280
Snow! So fluffy and light!

210
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,870
Show her something else.

211
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:39,730
Roll! Roll! Roll apple! Take
Nastya to the underwater kingdom!

212
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:45,330
Show her the priceless pearls
of the deep! Oh! Oh!

213
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,030
Oh look, the shelves open!

214
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,390
Showing their dearest treasures!

215
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,980
And here Nastya,

216
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,190
you will recognize

217
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,100
... your home shores.

218
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,280
No...

219
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,410
Don't please!

220
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,970
My dear father, my sisters!

221
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,720
I can't bear it...

222
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,480
Don't fret, Nastya!

223
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,730
You're not a prisoner here.

224
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,220
go to them.

225
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,920
Visit them!

226
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,510
Father!

227
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,760
My dearest father!
- Nastinka!

228
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,360
Daughters, come!

229
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,640
Nastya has returned!

230
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,640
Nastinka!

231
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,240
daughter of mine!

232
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,690
Sisters!

233
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,290
Dear sisters

234
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,720
Nastinka! Dearest!
Oh, my, you little pearl, just look at you!

235
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,440
just look at you!
Have you brought gifts for us? have you?

236
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,540
Gifts? Yes gifts!

237
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,660
And for me?

238
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,640
I was longing so much for home.

239
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,870
And he let me come,...

240
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,870
...right away!

241
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,880
Nastinka, My precious!

242
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,160
It's just I feel bad for him.

243
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,100
He is so very kind.

244
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:53,840
I promissed I would return...at sunset!

245
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:57,040
Oh, your word, sister!

246
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,510
You've tricked him once-

247
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,310
-you can just stay now!

248
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,510
Tricked him? No,
I haven't done anything of the sort!

249
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:14,670
If I am not back at precisely 8 PM,
I am sure he will die of grief!

250
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,820
I must return to him.

251
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,520
Hahaha, let him go!

252
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:24,170
Don't be silly!

253
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,660
Quiet you two chatterboxes!

254
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,330
Oh, what amazing gifts she's brought!

255
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,280
Gifts! I know, I know!

256
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,330
Yes, but think of

257
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,940
what she must have of her own!

258
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,890
Unheard of riches!

259
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,680
It's not fair.

260
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:03,030
--I am the eldest!.

261
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:06,040
...And I am the middle daughter!

262
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,610
You know what? (whispers)

263
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,640
She promised!

264
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,770
She promised to return

265
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,610
by sundown...

266
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm sorry, sisters! I feel I really must go.

267
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,200
I have this sense that I am being called.

268
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,460
what's the rush?

269
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,820
You've been gone so long!

270
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,550
Why rush to leave?

271
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,780
Look at the clock!

272
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,340
Calm down, my dear.

273
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,720
Go look at the sun and see that it's not set yet

274
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,780
sisters, why have you done this?!

275
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,000
Sun, please stop!

276
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,700
Wait!

277
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,060
Where are you my gentle friend!

278
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,910
Listen to me, I've come back to you!

279
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,560
Please wake up, my dear friend!

280
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,940
I love you my lonely beast!!

281
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,470
Nastinka!

282
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,070
Who are you?!? Oi.

283
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,440
Nastinka!

284
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,990
Nastinka!

285
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,170
Nastinka.

286
00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:02,790
You looked into my heart, and
loved me when I appeared to be
a beast.

287
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:07,710
Now see me and love me
for the human I really am.

288
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,570
An evil witch turned me
into a horrible monster.

289
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,250
She cast a spell so...

290
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,610
that I'd live that way...

291
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,230
Until a beautiful maiden

292
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,730
loved me for who I was

293
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,000
for my pure soul and tender heart.

294
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,440
The witch is no more!

295
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,370
And now, I shall love you, Nastya,

296
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,160
We've broken the evil spell,

297
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,220
now and forever! We can go home!

298

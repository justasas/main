00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,311
This year's best actress is...

2
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,511
Anna Battista!

3
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,076
What are your future projects?

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,157
20 films at the age of 20...

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,076
Don't the awards go to your head?

6
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,397
Next stop, Hollywood?

7
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,831
Anna, what do you think of love?

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,957
Are you in love right now?

9
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,998
You want to direct?

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,713
ls your decision final?

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,154
Do you want children?

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,714
Did the Dalai Lama impress you?

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,796
How important is the family?

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,359
And religion?

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,674
How many hours
do you spend in the gym?

16
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,998
Do you think ltalian cinema is dying?

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,749
Anna!

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,272
''Giovanna of the clouds''

19
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,759
Just a second!

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,990
Tyrone!

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,115
- They need you on set.
- Just a second.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,115
The pause is over. Come on!

23
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,038
What are they doing?

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,510
Fuck it, l didn't come!

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,759
lt hurts!

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,154
Dirty stuff again.

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,313
Enough. Enough already!

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,196
Remember what this ring means?

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,391
- l was sleeping, mom.
- No.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,309
l don't believe you!
l'll send you away to school.

31
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,195
To that place in Switzerland
where Chaplin's kids went!

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,349
l've got so much shit on,
so many scripts to read.

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,996
She's too much of a pest,
l can't take any more!

34
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,116
- Read that chapter of ''Moby Dick''?
- Yes.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,793
Well done, sis, l'm going to make
a writer of you one day.

36
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,512
l could act, like mom.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,631
Then you'll end up like her.

38
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,592
l keep my panties on.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,951
What?

40
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,230
When l do dirty things,
l keep them on.

41
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,069
Shut up!

42
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,675
Enough, Alioscia, l'll wet myself.

43
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,918
Dirty things...

44
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,351
A tattooed eye.
lt's Anna Battista.

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,516
- Show me up!
- Are you Anna Battista?

46
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,837
Have you really got a tattoo
on your fanny?

47
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,352
No, l put it on every morning.
lt's a fake, it's trendy.

48
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,629
How far does it go?

49
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,071
Hands off!
Only my husband knows that.

50
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,271
What husband? Where's your ring?

51
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,392
- Her husband...
- Sorry, got to go.

52
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,874
- Come here!
- A photo!

53
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,833
- She wants to run off...
- Smile!

54
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,313
Give me an autograph.

55
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,158
Grab a pen, man!

56
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,430
- What's your name?
- Maurizio.

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,234
Do one for me too. l'm Dado.

58
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,950
Guys...

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,275
Got to go.

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,076
Come back!

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,352
Anna, come back!

62
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,119
Don't go!

63
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,399
Stay with us!

64
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,919
Where's she going?

65
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,556
Leave a message for Veronica
after the tone.

66
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,910
Veronica, hi, it's Anna.

67
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
l'm in Locarno for a TV interview.

68
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,599
l'll be in Paris tomorrow.
Be there.

69
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,278
People say...

70
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,072
you're a man-eater.

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,955
How would you define yourself?

72
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,515
A relentless romantic.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,592
A fundamentally lonely girl.

74
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,080
lt's very hard for me to love someone.

75
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,840
l've been single for two years now.

76
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,957
- How about you?
- Me?

77
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,957
Tell me about your sex life.

78
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,076
l haven't had sex in five years.

79
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,199
l understand.

80
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,154
Can l sit next to you?

81
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,797
Please do.

82
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,871
Can l give you a hug?

83
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,239
Veronica, l'm in Paris.
Where the fuck are you?

84
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,834
Oh my God!

85
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,236
What the fuck's happened?

86
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,593
Anyone home?

87
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,151
Veronica?

88
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,235
Gross...

89
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,509
Oh my God!

90
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,675
Help!

91
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,196
What the fuck...

92
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,392
- Anna, untie me!
- How the fuck do l?

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,637
Untie the knots. Use the pincers.
Do something!

94
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,909
Calm down...

95
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,511
Where's she keep the pincers?

96
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,719
Hurry, l can't go on!

97
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,037
Give me a fucking second.
l'm doing my best!

98
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,357
l can't go on! Untie me!

99
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,996
Untie me, Anna!

100
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,829
l'm hurting all over!

101
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,792
Here l am.

102
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,356
Calm down. Stop moving.

103
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,556
Fuck!

104
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,078
Who the fuck did this?

105
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,399
Who was it?

106
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,833
Come here.

107
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,318
Who the fuck was it?

108
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,155
lt was Hamid. We fought,
he tied me up like this

109
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,751
and then he left.

110
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,553
How long ago?

111
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,273
Two days, l think.

112
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,831
lt's not my fault, Anna.

113
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,837
l'm mad about him.

114
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,190
Why does he have to be like this?

115
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,999
Hamid...

116
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,913
We went to Les Halles.
Where the fuck else?

117
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,675
Yeah, Barbes... Where's the hash?

118
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,511
Hi, how's it going?

119
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,753
- l'm looking for some shit.
- See the Yank.

120
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,678
- The Yank?
- Take her.

121
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,552
- Go with her.
- With me?

122
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,988
My friend waits?

123
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,395
- l'll wait.
- Won't be long.

124
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520
- What's that guy's name?
- Who? Hamid?

125
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,552
Yeah, Hamid...

126
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,348
Give me some of your apple?

127
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,879
l've finished it.

128
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,957
lt's tough today.
ln fact, l'm here in Paris

129
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,391
because l'm an actress and...
You know?

130
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,037
- What's ''to fuck'' in French?
- ''Baiser''.

131
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,588
Let's go.

132
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,031
A real piece of shit...

133
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,550
We used to be a threesome,
then she went solo.

134
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,117
Veronica, forget Hamid.

135
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,630
This thing has to stop.
Enough already.

136
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,957
l know, but subconsciously
l'm asking him to do it.

137
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,472
What the fuck do you mean?
You're like those American housewives

138
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,872
who get beaten up
and don't rat on their men.

139
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,231
Get dressed,
we're going to the fucking police

140
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,876
and that piece
of shit's going to jail.

141
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,269
Not dead yet, you dirty whore?

142
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,390
Bastard!

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,273
Let me do the talking. Calm down.

144
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,472
A man who beats a woman
has got no balls.

145
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,591
What do you do?

146
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,995
Beat up girls? You're a shithead.

147
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,909
l'm going to the police
about you, get it?

148
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,830
Don't!

149
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,631
You're evil!
You can't treat me like a whore!

150
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,115
Leave me alone. Don't touch me!

151
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,551
This time, l'll kill you,
l swear l will!

152
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,519
l'm not a whore!

153
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,999
l love you.

154
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,039
Guys, l'm outta here...
See you after the gig, okay.

155
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,989
Shall l go?

156
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,599
l'll wait for you.

157
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,479
Bye, see you later.

158
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,432
Hold on, l'll show you something.
lt's really important.

159
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,473
You like it? lt's a gun.

160
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,914
You're my love.
l'll wait for you forever.

161
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,268
Who the fuck
d'you think you are, bitch?

162
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,869
l'll get you, you whore!

163
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,232
lt's Veronica.

164
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,716
Hamid's left me.

165
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,512
l caught him screwing another woman.

166
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,991
l want to die.

167
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,834
lf you don't call, l'm killing myself.

168
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,758
The wasteland...

169
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,753
Anna, it's grandma.

170
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,836
Where are you?

171
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,874
Recently you've seemed
so detached and sceptical...

172
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,071
You seem unattainable.

173
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,677
l love you all the same.

174
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,870
Who is it?

175
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,629
Quelou.

176
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,150
Who are you?

177
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,315
Quelou.

178
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,474
- What a great apartment.
- You like it?

179
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,989
l didn't get a good look last time.

180
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,633
Last time?

181
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,039
Quelou...

182
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,073
Quelou?

183
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,671

184
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,393
l feel kind of...

185
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,796
Tell me, where was it we met?

186
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,193
At a party?

187
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,035
On a plane?

188
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,596
What do you do?

189
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,277
You really don't remember?

190
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,959
Listen...

191
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,399
l've got a cab waiting downstairs

192
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,230
and l have to leave in half an hour.
D'you want

193
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,989
to get off?

194
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,673
You're scaring me.

195
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,632
What do you mean, scaring you?

196
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,673
Remember
how you licked me last time?

197
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,194
When?

198
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,191
You're like a child...

199
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,119
l have to be going now.

200
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,391
- You have to go?
- Yes.

201
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,596
l don't want to miss my flight.

202
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,474
Give me your number and l'll call you.

203
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,272
You know, l'm really catching a plane.

204
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,274
Thanks.

205
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,759
- ln case l lose it...
- You mustn't.

206
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,038
Are you crazy?
All this fuss over measles!

207
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,958
Did you bring my Roip?

208
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:42,950
l'm cold.

209
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,549
- So cold.
- Anna, dear...

210
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,036
aren't you pleased
to stay at home for a few days?

211
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,597
Don't say that in front of her.

212
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,030
What does she know
about pharmaceuticals?

213
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,276
Alioscia?

214
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,998
lf l die,
you can have all my stickers.

215
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,673
Mom! Wake up,
we've made your breakfast.

216
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,310
Overdose.

217
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,836
Who the hell do we call?

218
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,828
You forgot to feed them again.

219
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,995
You're like your mother.

220
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,794
l don't know why l married you.

221
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,753
Married me?

222
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,156
What d'you mean?

223
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,875
l'm the father of your son.

224
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,959
l don't know who you are.

225
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,875
My baby!

226
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,514
My baby! Help!

227
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,112
ln the head!

228
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,356
- Who is it?
- Mrs... or Miss Battista?

229
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,235
What time is it?

230
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,919
Just a second.

231
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,913
Half past ten.

232
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,475
l'm Vessi, your gynaecologist.

233
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,352
lt's about the test...

234
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,553
Yes.

235
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,955
The pregnancy test.

236
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,949
And?

237
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,079
Pregnant.

238
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,389
Hello?

239
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,152
What shall we do now?
Another abortion?

240
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,792
No, doctor.

241
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,398
Not an abortion.

242
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,798
Okay, no abortion.

243
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,873
See you soon.

244
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,232
Paaradei's buying...

245
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,032
the US distribution rights.

246
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,952
lt's a great opportunity.

247
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,357
Barry Paar came here in person
to sign the deal.

248
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,710
l mean, it's incredible.

249
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,512
Totally incredible!

250
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,999
What the fuck?

251
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:33,158
Congratulations on the award!

252
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,679
Good to see you!

253
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,912
Cleopatra... What's up?

254
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,712
l've lost my shoes,

255
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,911
my fur, the award, everything!

256
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:04,235
What happened?

257
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,237
Who the fuck
did you leave me with?

258
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,873
What d'you mean?

259
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,593
The guy's a top producer.

260
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,791
Barry Paar wanted to screw me.

261
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,514
He said, ''l want to eat your fur pie.''

262
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,835
Calm down, okay.

263
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,598
Look at the mess l'm in!

264
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,392
Okay, forget that now.

265
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,636
You fly to London tomorrow.

266
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,794
London... God, she's forgotten!

267
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,956
The Vogue shoot with Luke Ford.

268
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,595
That's actress shit. l want to direct.

269
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,994
For God's sake...

270
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,953
Why do they all want
to be directors here?

271
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,197
You're my agent.
You have to help me direct.

272
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,197
l sent you to Barry Paar.

273
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,836
You sent me to a shithead
who wanted to rape me!

274
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,959
What is this place?
''Shining''?

275
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,679
l don't believe it...

276
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,989
Calm down!

277
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,429
Anna, get up.

278
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,234
The crapper...

279
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,557
This isn't me.

280
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,479
This isn't me...

281
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,518
They're laughing at me.

282
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:12,878
They can see me.

283
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,598
Let's wash our face.

284
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,155
Like this...

285
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,593
My baby...

286
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,031
My belly...

287
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,074
Get away from me!

288
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,194
Let her die.

289
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,393
Anna, its Margherita.

290
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,319
l've got the Cleopatra pages

291
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,670
for Saturday's screen test in LA.

292
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,031
As for the flight, there's one at...

293
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:42,472
We shall be landing in LA
in 20 minutes.

294
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,114
Would all passengers

295
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:48,312
please remain seated...

296
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,117
You don't give a shit
about Aaron Ulrich now?

297
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,031
He's always been your idol.

298
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,359
l'm not saying l don't give a shit
about working with him.

299
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:34,155
Why else would l spend
20 hours on a train to Amsterdam?

300
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,189
He's the world's greatest living
writer-director.

301
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,518
But l don't want to work for him,
l'd like him to work for me.

302
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,709
You can call by here, right?
Come to Paris.

303
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,434
Come on, come to Paris.

304
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,554
Please...

305
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:54,635
Shit!

306
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,917
Snow started falling softly...

307
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,596
as light as candyfloss...

308
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,274
THE END

309
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,359
Read that chapter of ''Moby Dick''?

310
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,435
Well done, sis, you'll be a writer.

311
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,594
Seen that, Alioscia?

312
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:01,075
Fuck it!

313
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,192
You're irresponsible.

314
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:11,637
Your first check-up
in five months of pregnancy.

315
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,392
Just tell me

316
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,432
if it's alive or dead.

317
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,517
lt's alive and it's a girl.

318
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,038
My baby...

319
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,038
She's clenching her fists...

320
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:45,556
And you're both in prefect health.
Look at her.

321
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,356
Doctor, thank you.

322
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:54,438
Thank you, doctor.

323
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,710
Seven months.

324
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:06,350
You mean you're still going
on that Australian guy?

325
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,515
His name's Kirk.

326
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,552
l don't know.
He's never been in touch...

327
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,828
He's never called, l know it's over.

328
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,271
He's dumped me, okay.

329
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,997
l know his group's
playing the Cigale tonight.

330
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,668
The very place where l met him.

331
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:29,358
l'm going to surprise him.

332
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:33,477
God, Anna, surprises suck.

333
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,470
l'm sure it'll all go well.

334
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:40,514
l'm sure
he'll knock me out tonight.

335
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:49,555
You always make me late.
Fuck, it's already started.

336
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,079
lt'll all be okay.

337
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,033
Love isn't always poison
as Bob Dylan said.

338
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,071
Or my mom. l forget now.

339
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:04,631
God, he's so good-looking!
lt's just like last year.

340
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,479
- Go on.
- Really?

341
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,113
Come with me?

342
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,312
Go on your own, everything's okay.

343
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,316
Let go!

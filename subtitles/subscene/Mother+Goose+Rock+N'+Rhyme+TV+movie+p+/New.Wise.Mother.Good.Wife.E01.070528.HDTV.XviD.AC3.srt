1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,100
I want to be a good
wife and mother when I grow up.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,490
I don't have a mom.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,150
She passed away when I was 5.

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,020
That's why I don't have a mom
waiting for me when I come home.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:31,010
When I grow up, I want to be a mom
who waits for her kids at home.

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,150
I want to be a good mom
and a good wife.

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,080
I want my help my husband and kids
to become leaders of Korea!

8
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,170
- Episode 1 -
Men nowadays...

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,100
...have a different definition of what
a good wife and mother is.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,330
What kind of a wife and mother
do Korean men want now?

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:01,090
First of all, men want women
who are financially settled.

12
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:07,310
Because of the rising prices and housing costs, men want a double-income family.

13
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,390
Second of all...

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,260
...men want women who can increase assets through smart investments.

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,070
They also wanted
women to be up to date...

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,000
...on information regarding childrearing.

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you!
Thank you!

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,140
Moreover, they expect women to carry out the traditional role of a housewife.

19
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,120
They want women to be
a professional at home as well.

20
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,320
Don't watch it.

21
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,120
It's not that good.

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,370
I can't believe it's on the news now.

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,220
I know you're happy!

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,090
You got the scoop of the month with that modern good wife and mother article.

25
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,060
Here.

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,290
Maybe your wife is
a modern good wife and mother.

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,370
Maybe that's why you thought of
such a fine idea like that.

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,380
That's right.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
Modern good wife and mother?

30
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,070
My wife?

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Gosh, this is giving me a headache.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,030
You can leave that here
and take this instead.

33
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay.

34
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,040
Damn knockoff...

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,050
Get off, Eun-Suk.

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,340
Listen to your teacher
and don't talk during class.

37
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,300
Okay.

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
Guk-hee.

39
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,420
Hi.

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,070
Are you going to Gi-Suk's
kindergarten registration?

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,030
Of course!

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,290
A lot of people stand in line
since the day before.

43
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,340
Are you coming?

44
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,090
I'm going to send my housekeeper.

45
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,410
Call me if she does something wrong.

46
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,480
Sure, I will.

47
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,430
Hello.

48
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,310
Hi. Bye.

49
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,360
Because of this...

50
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,120
Mom cannot sleeping well, you know?

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,110
You're embarrassing me.

52
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,070
You have a horrible accent.

53
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,110
No, that's wrong.

54
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,320
Because...

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,050
Since we can't afford American tutors, you need to practice with me.

56
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,090
Go.

57
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,230
Where's my homework?

58
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,100
What do you think?

59
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm good, aren't I?

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,390
The other kids told me that
their afterschool art teacher...

61
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,190
...made their projects for them.

62
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,140
Mine looks the worst.

63
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,070
But mine's much better than
the ones other moms made.

64
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,310
During art class...

65
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,080
Hello?

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,390
What?

67
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,120
Mom!

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,100
Uh-huh!

69
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,150
- I'll be there to pick up Gi-Suk.
- Gosh...

70
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,430
What are you going to do?

71
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm going to be graded on this!

72
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,110
I have to pick up Gi-Suk...

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,020
I'll make sure it's ready for art class.

74
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,050
I promise!

75
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,120
Oh, my legs.

76
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,100
Today's the last payment, right?

77
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
You're finally going to be a homeowner.

78
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,220
Congratulations.

79
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,250
I've been losing sleep
because I'm excited.

80
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,410
Good job.

81
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,160
I heard that they're going to
open another market chain!

82
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,440
We're just a local market!

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,450
They're driving me out of business!

84
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Can't you do something about that hair?

85
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,020
Let's make this work!

86
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,280
Okay, I'll be there.

88
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,150
Now?

89
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,000
When he's acting like that?

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Child Center

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,070
Hop on, Gi-Suk.

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,050
Where are we going?

93
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,060
Today's your kindergarten
registration day.

94
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,120
Why is everyone running?

95
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,130
Why?

96
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,200
Why are you running?

97
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,300
Hold on.

98
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,280
Gi-Suk, get off.

99
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,140
I have to run.

100
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,480
Watch my bike until I get back.

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,070
Stop it!

102
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,090
Get in a line!

103
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,450
Whew...I got a number!

104
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,370
Excuse me, but...

105
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,060
What's this?

106
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,210
3 bowls of jajangmyeon,
5 bowls of champon?

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,180
That's our lunch order.

108
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,120
I've been waiting for years
to get my kid in this kindergarten.

109
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,110
Help me!

110
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,350
Are you a double income household?

111
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,380
Yes, I make money too.

112
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,490
We have another slot for
double income households.

113
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,290
I need proof of employment
from you and your husband.

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:59,060
I work part-time,
so I don't have anything like that.

115
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,390
We'll post a notice if someone opts out.

116
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,080
These women and I got here
around the same time.

117
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,050
This isn't fair for me.

118
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,040
I know, but we don't have
any empty slots.

119
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,420
I can't just leave like this!

120
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,280
This isn't fair!

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,010
Public kindergartens
aren't supposed to do this!

122
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,190
I'm going to file a complaint!

123
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,350
What do you want me to do?

124
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,420
We didn't break any rules.

125
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,210
Do whatever you want.

126
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,030
I'm sorry!

127
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,190
Don't go!

128
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,020
Please, hear me out.

129
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,130
We don't have any money.

130
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,060
The kids are getting older,
but we don't even own a home.

131
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,080
I don't even have time
to take my wisdom tooth out...

132
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,290
...because I'm always working
or taking care of the house.

133
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,100
I really need my kid to go to
a public kindergarten.

134
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm begging you.

135
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,030
But I can't help you.

136
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,290
Put me on the top of the list
if someone opts out.

137
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,180
I'll keep this cell phone if you don't.

138
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,050
I won't even go home.

139
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,450
Please? I'm begging you.

140
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,260
We don't have any money.

141
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,380
Gi-Suk!

142
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,000
Mom!

143
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
Let's go!

144
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,370
Let's go!

145
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,230
Why isn't she back from the restroom?

146
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,210
I have constipation.

147
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,210
I'm sorry.

148
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,130
I'm a little sensitive because of
the real estate contract.

149
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,080
It takes me forever in the restroom.

150
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,270
But this won't happen again.

151
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
I'm buying a house today.

152
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,070
This is all thanks to you.

153
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,220
My constipation will be gone
after I buy that house.

154
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,460
I'll work harder from now on.

155
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,060
Do you know how long
you've been gone?

156
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm sorry,
I'll never leave my station again.

157
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,360
Mom!

158
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,050
M-M-Mom?

159
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,130
Did you lose your mom?

160
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,130
How?

161
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,110
In this market?

162
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,340
I'll help you find your mom.

163
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,080
Excuse me!
Has anyone lost their son?

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,280
Cut it out!

165
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,350
He looks exactly like you!

166
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,190
It's almost time for Eun-Suk's art class.

167
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
- Why is he still here?
- I don't know.

168
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,040
Jung-Chul!

169
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,250
Where is he?

170
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,200
I need him to make deliveries.

171
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,070
Jung-Chul!

172
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,250
I'll do it!

173
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,270
Huh?

174
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,420
I'm a cashier,
but I can make deliveries too.

175
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,190
I should help out when the
market needs help, right?

176
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,390
I'll do it.

177
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,020
Hold tight, Gi-Suk.

178
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,450
Eun-Suk!

179
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,030
Class is over!

180
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,410
I couldn't turn my homework in!

181
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,420
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,310
I'm so sorry, Eun-Suk.

183
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,080
I'll make sure that I finish your
science homework ahead of time.

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,350
Don't get mad.

185
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,340
Come on, Eun-Suk!

186
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,380
That's a good boy.

187
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,040
I love you!

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,350
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,240
You're on.

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,130
We're only going to play poker, okay?

191
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,160
Okay.

192
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,330
Myung-Pil, are you sure your wife's
okay with unexpected visitors?

193
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,320
She's always ready
when her husband needs her.

194
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,290
This is when a housewife
comes in handy.

195
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,380
We can go anytime we want.

196
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,360
Hello, Honey.

197
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,250
My co-workers and I are going to play poker at our house today...

198
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,170
...to congratulate me
for getting a reporter's reward.

199
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,030
There are going to be 4 people,
including me.

200
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,210
What?

201
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,450
Now?

202
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,310
No way!

203
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,140
I have to stay and clean the floor because the market owner's mad at me.

204
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
What?

205
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,120
You already have the food ready?

206
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,080
I have to pay the rest of
the payment for the house.

207
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,390
The house is a mess,
and we don't have anything to eat.

208
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,190
Honey, just do it
in someone else's house.

209
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,240
Not today, okay?

210
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,250
I'm begging you.

211
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,110
Okay, I'll be there in 30~40 minutes.

212
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,400
She says she'll be waiting.

213
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:56,380
Myung-Pil!

214
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,310
She's a good wife!

215
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Are you making fun of me?

216
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,050
Mr. Yeom lives with a good wife.

217
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,110
His wife is an acupuncturist.

218
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,060
Don't you see that smile on his face?

219
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,410
I'm going to win all your money
if you make fun of me.

220
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,440
But you always lose!

221
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,250
Kyung Guk-Hee!

222
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,140
You're going to be a homeowner today!

223
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,260
I think I'll be about 20 minutes late.

224
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,430
Can you wait for me?

225
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,100
I'll be there as soon as we can!

226
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,050
Take your time!

227
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,240
What?

228
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:10,390
The homeowner wants
to see you tomorrow.

229
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,430
Tomorrow at 6?

230
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,440
Okay, see you tomorrow.

231
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,280
Stop goofing around, Eun-Suk!

232
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,190
Take the trash out with Gi-Suk!

233
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,350
Make sure you throw it away
in the trash bag!

234
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,090
Hurry! Take your brother with you!

235
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,400
Where are you?

236
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,250
Near the district office.

237
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,100
I'll be there soon.

238
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,410
What?

239
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,030
Good evening!

240
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,270
Honey!

241
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,460
Hi!

242
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:10,060
I'm so sorry about making you nosebleed while cooking for us.

243
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,280
Look at all the food!

244
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:18,000
I feel bad making you cook all these.

245
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,140
I told you to serve the leftovers!

246
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,150
Enjoy your meal!

247
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,080
Thank you!

248
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,210
Thank you!

249
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,380
Enjoy!

250
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,340
Are you expecting more guests?

251
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,330
No.

252
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,450
Hold on.

253
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,200
The door's unlocked.

254
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,100
The rib soup and
the clam soup costs $60.

255
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,280
You gave me a $1 instead of a $10 bill.

256
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,320
You owe me $9.

257
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,380
Okay, okay!

258
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,010
These ribs are good!

259
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,220
Let's eat!

260
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,110
I'll raise you by $10.

261
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,480
I fold.

262
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,230
Sorry, I won.

263
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,310
This is boring.

264
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,080
Let's go.

265
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,130
Already?

266
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,190
Would you like some beer?

267
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,420
No, I should go home.

268
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,160
Why, you should stay longer!

269
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,390
You're not going anywhere.

270
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,360
My secret weapon is coming.

271
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,320
Start dealing!

272
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,350
Unless it's a pretty woman or a rich man who's bad at gambling.

273
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,350
Why should we wait?

274
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,010
We'll see about that.

275
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,320
Start dealing!

276
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,000
It's here!

277
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,020
Long time no see, Guk-Hee.

278
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,370
I think it's been 4 months
since I last saw you.

279
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,060
Didn't you miss me?

280
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,150
Here you go.

281
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,470
She's my wife's friend,
and my best school friend.

282
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,440
Her name is Im Tae-Ran,
and she's a writer.

283
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,160
The three of us are from the
United University Singers.

284
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,180
You two are the same age?

285
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,030
Yes.

286
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,000
Same age?

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,310
Friend? Yeah right!

288
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,250
I never hung out with a loser like you.

289
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,400
Why? We don't look the same age?

290
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,300
Do I look that old?

291
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,330
Well, my job requires me
to pull a lot of all-nighters.

292
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,480
No, no!

293
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,060
I hate you!

294
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,470
I really hate you!

295
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,280
You mean Guk-Hee?

296
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,410
She's pretty.

297
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,470
She was Miss Myeongdong
when she was younger.

298
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,370
Here we go again.

299
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,030
Why are you a writer?

300
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,260
You should be a model!

301
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,290
Not everyone can become a model.

302
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,250
Barf!

303
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,440
Have a seat!

304
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Okay.

305
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,070
You make me sick.

306
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,400
Would you like something to drink?

307
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,380
Sure.

308
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,130
Go away!

309
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,100
Take it easy.

310
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,100
This doesn't happen too often.

311
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,050
You can't help it.

312
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,070
I'll clean it up.

313
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,120
You can't help it?

314
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,460
Our apartment is the first one
to be designated...

315
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,200
...as earth-friendly by the district office!

316
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,160
You know how much
the real estate went up after that, right?

317
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,050
That's all thanks to me.

318
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,180
I tried my best to keep this place
clean because I had that in mind.

319
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:11,060
Yes, I know.

320
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,320
How can someone do this before
our real estate values go up again?

321
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,310
I'm sure it's the renters who did this!

322
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,450
The renters!

323
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,180
How embarrassing.

324
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,080
Wow!!

325
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,280
You actually made this?

326
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,350
In that short notice?

327
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,100
But you must be busy with work!

328
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,010
No, I just brought
what I had in my workroom.

329
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,210
That means you're always ready to cook.

330
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,380
You're perfect.

331
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,420
You write well, make good money,
are pretty and also smart.

332
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,190
On top of that, you can cook!

333
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,100
Wait, that means she's the modern good wife and mother in your article!

334
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,100
She can do everything!

335
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,440
Her? Yeah right.

336
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,250
What's this world coming to?

337
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,380
No, I'm not.

338
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,100
Look at Guk-Hee.

339
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,110
She wanted to be a good mother
and wife ever since she was little.

340
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,370
What about now?

341
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,410
She's a good wife and mother too...

342
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,160
...but the wife Myung-Pil wrote about needs to make a lot of money.

343
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,290
Just like you, a lot of money!

344
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,430
Drop dead, will you?

345
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,220
Honey, bring us some wineglasses.

346
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,000
Tae-Ran brought us expensive wine.

347
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Guk-Hee, can you bring us some plates and chopsticks?

348
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,100
Okay.

349
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,020
I fold.

350
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,030
It's just Mr. Yeom and Tae-Ran now.

351
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,450
I'm torn.

352
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,260
I think he has a good hand.

353
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,350
What should I do?

354
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,220
Ten.

355
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,060
Ten more!

356
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,100
Is it a made hand?

357
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,170
A full house?

358
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,030
Okay, I fold.

359
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,040
Enjoy.

360
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,020
Yes! Tae-Ran won with a pair of 3!

361
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,480
You were bluffing?

362
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,380
You're such a good liar.

363
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,270
I won, thanks to you.

364
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,480
Don't you think Myung-Pil
is an alpha male?

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,170
He's very competitive.

366
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,290
There are single men here.

367
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,210
Don't favor the married man.

368
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:30,170
She's my fan!
Leave her alone!

369
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,080
A lot of girls liked me in college.

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,210
She was one of them.

371
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,150
Really?

372
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,440
Yes, for a short while.

373
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,430
But Myung-Pil wasn't interested in me.

374
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,000
He only wanted Guk-Hee.

375
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,340
Im Tae-Ran!

376
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,170
Why are you rubbing it in for?

377
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,010
What are you trying to say?

378
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,240
That you're better than me?

379
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,020
Do you want to show off?

380
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,470
Yes, you're better than me!

381
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,230
So don't come to my house anymore!

382
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,040
Don't ever show up in front of
me and my husband!

383
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,020
She's going to kill her!

384
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,470
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,050
Please stop hitting me.

386
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,090
It hurts.

387
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,300
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,260
I don't think I deserve this.

389
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,210
I'll never come here again.

390
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,010
Guk-Hee.

391
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,110
Guk-Hee!

392
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,430
Do you have anything else?

393
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,310
Wine needs to be served in wineglass.

394
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,180
Do you have any wineglass, Guk-Hee?

395
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,030
This is all we have in our house.

396
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,260
Okay, we'll use this for today.

397
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,010
I'll treat you with a wineglass next time.

398
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,170
Why don't we meet up
at her place next time?

399
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,340
She has a huge house she works in.

400
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,110
She's already a homeowner?

401
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,410
Myung-Pil, you must be jealous.

402
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,190
He's going to buy a house too.

403
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,160
Oh, yeah.

404
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,190
Did you sign the contract?

405
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,060
You can say that since we already signed the contract!

406
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,280
Tomorrow's the last payment.

407
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,300
Must've been tough.

408
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,330
No.

409
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,010
Unmarried people don't know...

410
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,180
...how great it is to move to a
bigger place with your family.

411
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,230
Good for you.

412
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,080
Remember, you were supposed to buy me a drink after you buy a house.

413
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,450
Ji-Young and I are waiting.

414
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,050
Sure! Come over tomorrow.

415
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,030
I'll show you the deed while we drink.

416
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,050
Attention everyone.

417
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:29,060
Some shameless residents have
disposed of their trash illegally.

418
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,210
These trashers pollute the earth.

419
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,120
They're murdering indirectly by polluting the earth our children grow up in...

420
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,360
...shortening their lives.

421
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,110
I'm going to dig through the trash
to find any receipt or picture...

422
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,250
...to see which house it is.

423
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,110
Eun-Suk, wake up.

424
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,030
Why?

425
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:06,130
Did you use the trash bag
when you took out the trash?

426
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,250
No, I didn't.

427
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,460
3 and 5.

428
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,490
That's 8 total.

429
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,360
I fold.

430
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,300
I'll raise you by 8 more.

431
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,120
He's going to fold
if someone bluffs again.

432
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,460
Whatever.

433
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,150
What are you doing?

434
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,360
Oh, my back itches.

435
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,120
Honey!

436
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,090
Yes?

437
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,390
Why don't we eat ramen?

438
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,080
Sure!

439
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:09,480
Five ramen!

440
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,070
I'll go and buy ramen.

441
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,460
No, it wasn't me!

442
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,170
What's going on?

443
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:08,420
Gotcha!

444
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,430
It's not me, it's not me!

445
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,300
It was the renters, all right.

446
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,060
They really did come, like you said.

447
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,350
It's like catching mice.

448
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,310
All you need to do is to wait
after setting the mousetrap.

449
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,430
What are we going to do with them?

450
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,480
Let's hand them to the Police.

451
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,170
Let's kick them out of the apartment.

452
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,040
We need to embarrass them in public.

453
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,080
This is driving me crazy.

454
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,480
How embarrassing.

455
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,110
I hate this!

456
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,120
Wait! It wasn't me!

457
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,140
Su-Duk doesn't belong here.

458
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,360
Who's Su-Duk?

459
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,090
Me.

460
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,300
You don't belong here?

461
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,110
I recognize you guys.

462
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,450
I heard that you beat your kids.

463
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,040
You tried to steal someone else's delivered package, right?

464
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,350
But...

465
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,040
You've been flirting with every man
you see after you got divorce.

466
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,030
You're too busy working in that
market to take care of your family.

467
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,370
I'm not surprised to see you here.

468
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,190
What?

469
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,300
I never flirted with men!

470
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
You don't know anything!

471
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,050
You can't talk to me that way!

472
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,160
Who do you think you are?

473
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,150
What do you mean,
I don't take care of my family?

474
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,440
You're wrong!

475
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,290
I didn't try to steal it!

476
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,310
I only took a look!

477
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,120
Guk-Hee!

478
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,070
Honey!

479
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,490
What are you doing here?

480
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,400
Did you enjoy your dinner?

481
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,060
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends!

482
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:44,060
You can't even take out the trash?

483
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,440
Why did you do that for?

484
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,170
I told Eun-Suk to do it,
but he didn't do it right.

485
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,260
Why did you make Eun-Suk do it?

486
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,410
You have a lot of free time in the house!

487
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,240
Why did you make him do it?

488
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,180
What do you mean,
I have a lot of free time?

489
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:01,110
This is all because you brought unexpected visitors!

490
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,320
Do you know how busy I was today?

491
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,050
I get scared every morning
because I have so much to do!

492
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,070
Don't tell me you have a lot to do!

493
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,000
You just can't handle it
because you're incompetent.

494
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,000
Do you know
what the Pareto principle is?

495
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,240
Do you?

496
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,450
Answer me.

497
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,060
It's the law of the vital few.

498
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,170
As long as you take care
of the important 20%...

499
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,400
...the rest won't be a problem.

500
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:39,240
If you're busy, prioritize your tasks and start with the most important ones.

501
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,210
Then you wouldn't have to
make your kid take out the trash!

502
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:46,090
If you want that to happen,
you need to use your brain!

503
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,020
You're always messing up
because you don't think!

504
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,400
Don't you have any
wrinkles on your brain?

505
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,120
Why can't you think?

506
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,010
Did you get botox on your brain?

507
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,370
Botox? On the brain?

508
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,110
How can you say that?

509
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,460
See?

510
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:09,160
You can't take constructive criticism!

511
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,000
You get offended after
taking words at their face value!

512
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:17,380
That's why I'm telling you that
you got botox on your brain!

513
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,100
Where's my propecia?

514
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,310
The hormone I take to prevent hair loss.

515
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,250
I know I left it here somewhere.

516
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,330
I know it was somewhere here.

517
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,340
You really don't know where it is?

518
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,420
It's right here.

519
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,470
Where?

520
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,270
Right in front of you.

521
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,180
I don't see it.

522
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,450
Here.

523
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,200
So there it was!

524
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,250
Thanks.

525
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,080
What are you doing?

526
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,490
I don't remember because
I got botox on my brain.

527
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,350
Are those the papers for the house?

528
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,100
You have them all, right?

529
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,130
I don't know.

530
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,020
Come on...

531
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,080
You make it sound as though you're buying this house on your own.

532
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,160
I get the chills whenever I think about how many fights I had with you...

533
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,180
...about buying the house.

534
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:45,130
You told me that we should buy a house, but you didn't let me do anything!

535
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:47,050
Here we go again.

536
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,210
Is it because I didn't let you
become a nutritionist?

537
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,400
I can't get a full-time job.

538
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:53,420
We needed to buy a house,
but we didn't have enough money.

539
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,120
It took longer because I had
to take so many part-time jobs.

540
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,030
You don't need to cremate me
after I die...

541
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,290
...because I've already been
shattered to pieces inside.

542
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,130
Oops!

543
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,130
Here we go again.

544
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,210
Hey Guk-Hee.

545
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,080
Why don't you take a shower?

546
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,460
Aren't you going to bed?

547
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,290
Go ahead without me.

548
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,090
Why?

549
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:21,330
You told me to take a shower.

550
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,380
Because you smelled like sweat.

551
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,220
It's been more than 8 months.

552
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,030
I better go to bed.

553
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,230
Hi!

554
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,270
We're going to buy a house!

555
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,490
It's a big house!

556
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,490
Let's go.

557
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,390
Gi-Suk! Be quiet!

558
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,490
I'm sorry.

559
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:12,130
It's okay, he's just being a kid.

560
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,350
Did you complete all the documents?

561
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,340
Hi!

562
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,050
Let's call this deal off.

563
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,240
I'll give you $1,000 fine
to terminate the contract.

564
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,420
Take this and let's call this deal off.

565
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,430
What?

566
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Hold on.

567
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,490
What's wrong?

568
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,210
There are talks about developing
this neighborhood.

569
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,420
It's a rumor.

570
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,190
The government announced that there won't be any developments for now.

571
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,440
No one's going to believe that.

572
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:45,070
I have my resources.

573
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,140
I want $20,000 more
if you want the house.

574
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,240
$20,000?

575
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,130
Why won't we cover a wife
who became a star by blogging?

576
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,370
I think people will be interested
if we cover a celebrity.

577
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,060
Actress Choi Hye-Ran has a blog...

578
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,100
Sorry, it's for me.

579
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,200
Honey, I'm in a meeting.

580
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,180
I'll talk to you later.

581
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll take my battery out.

582
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,010
We can't sit here and wait forever.

583
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,190
What do you want to do?

584
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,220
Just take this money.

585
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,410
Let's call the deal off.

586
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,110
I'm going to rip this contract.

587
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,340
Wait! Wait!

588
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,220
Then, I'll give you $20,000 more.

589
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,480
Hello?

590
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,020
What?

591
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,350
Okay.

592
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,250
I need more than $20,000.

593
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,250
If you want to buy, I want $60,000 more.

594
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,070
What?

595
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:03,250
Someone sold her house for $60,000 more than market value today.

596
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,140
I don't see any reason
not to do the same.

597
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,230
Hold on.

598
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,230
The government's sudden announcement for development...

599
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,460
...is bringing excitement to the
real estate market in Gyeonggi-do.

600
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:21,090
The apartment prices went up by thousands of dollars today.

601
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,490
Almost no one is selling.

602
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,290
Whoa!

603
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,420
Myung-Pil!

604
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,490
You've hit the jackpot!

605
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,280
Thank you.

606
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,360
Your wife's buying the house
today, right?

607
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:34,030
Someone from our office
just made bank.

608
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,280
Some places are worth $100,000
more than they used to be.

609
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,330
Your wife bought out
the best spot out there.

610
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,430
Wow, lucky you.

611
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,270
Guk-Hee!

612
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,160
Guk-hee!

613
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,440
Why didn't you answer your phone?

614
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,230
Show me the contract.

615
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:57,140
Let me look at it.

616
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,330
We just made bank!

617
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,290
We finally got lucky!

618
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,270
Why the long face?

619
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,310
What's wrong?

620
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,330
I couldn't buy it.

621
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,210
I didn't buy the house.

622
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,050
What?

623
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,070
Why didn't you buy it?

624
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,320
We already signed the contract.

625
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,240
All we need to do was
make the last payment.

626
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,060
She wanted $60,000 more on the spot.

627
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,270
$60,000? That's nothing!

628
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:36,310
The value went up
by $100,000 more in one day!

629
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,480
You should've bought it!

630
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,080
There you were!

631
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,030
I ran here as soon as I saw the news.

632
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,390
You're rich now.

633
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,320
It was perfect timing.

634
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,390
We're all set now.

635
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,140
Why the long faces?

636
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,020
What's wrong?

637
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,150
Did you do that because
you didn't want to live with me?

638
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,250
Is it because we decided to live
together after you buy a house?

639
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,280
She said the woman wanted
$60,000 more on the spot.

640
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,360
$60,000?

641
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:27,270
She should've given it to her!

642
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,040
Everything was all set for you?

643
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:37,030
Why is it so difficult for you to buy something that...

644
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,480
...everyone else seems to have?

645
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:46,440
Now that the rent deposit went up
by tens of thousands of dollars...

646
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,430
...the money you saved up
will only cover the rent.

647
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,030
When and how are you
going to buy a house now?

648
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:06,250
My son's been working hard
for 10 years...

649
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,260
...after graduating from
Seoul National University Law School.

650
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,040
Yet he doesn't even have a house.

651
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,400
Who would believe that?

652
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,090
My poor son has
nothing to show for himself.

653
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,020
Hello?

654
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,440
I just turned in my final draft.

655
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,360
You bought the house, right?

656
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:38,380
I'll see you and Guk-Hee at the
cart bar in front of your house.

657
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,480
Okay, Tae-Ran.

658
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,110
Was that Tae-Ran?

659
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,090
Yes.

660
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,410
I heard that she already
owns two houses.

661
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,080
She's so lucky.

662
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,460
I didn't know that this
was going to happen.

663
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:04,090
I was just unlucky.

664
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,230
Guess what?

665
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,070
Luck comes to those who deserve them.

666
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,060
Hello?

667
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,250
What?

668
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,450
Someone wants you to clean
the trash bin as punishment.

669
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,250
What is she talking about?

670
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:08,310
But Su-Duk didn't do it.

671
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,340
Why did you kick that for?

672
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,060
Who do you think is going to clean that?

673
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,230
I hate people who do that!

674
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,110
No wonder you steal
other people's things.

675
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:24,110
What did you just say?

676
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:26,390
Su-Duk only took a look!

677
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,270
You're right.

678
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,040
We don't have to work this hard.

679
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,320
Let's take a break.

680
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:53,270
It's a dead end.

681
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:58,410
I want to go to the beach.

682
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,320
Sounds nice.

683
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,360
It's the full moon.

684
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,330
I didn't know you can see
the moon from here.

685
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,080
It's been such a long time
since I last saw the moon.

686
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,070
I think it's been years.

687
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,070
I wonder why I never got
a chance to see the moon.

688
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:21,300
I don't have time to see the moon.

689
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,180
I'm too busy worrying about
what's for dinner...

690
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,120
...and how I'm going to
pay for my kids' tuitions.

691
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,220
I don't even time to take
a break during the day.

692
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,140
I guess that's life.

693
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,140
How about you?

694
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:37,080
Do you see the moon?

695
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,270
No...

696
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,010
I want to die.

697
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,390
Die? Why?

698
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,070
Is your husband cheating on you?

699
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,120
Maybe she's divorced.

700
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,050
Did your husband leave you?

701
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,220
I get it.

702
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,330
He left home because
he cheated on you.

703
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,310
Is he with another woman now?

704
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,040
I hate men like him.

705
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,070
Don't just sit here.

706
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,110
Go and drag him home.

707
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,130
You should do something about it.

708
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:28,120
Where are you going?

709
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,120
To my husband.

710
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,410
We have some problems in the house.

711
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,420
I'll go and check if my husband's okay.

712
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,490
Do you know what
Jubel said on marriage?

713
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:05,110
Marry a woman you should take
as a friend if she was a man?

714
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:22,010
If Guk-hee was a man,
I would never be friends with her.

715
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:30,110
Why? Because she's too dumb for me.

716
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,290
According to Jubel,
I married the wrong woman.

717
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,290
I thought it'd be okay because
she's pretty and easy to get along with.

718
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,010
But she's been such a
stumbling block to my life!

719
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,340
You're only saying that
because you're mad.

720
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:02,270
You're so lucky, Tae-Ran.

721
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:04,290
You have everything.

722
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:11,480
I should've married you instead!

723
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,300
Cheers!

724
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:58,250
Did you meet your husband?

725
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,120
You wanted to go to the beach, right?

726
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,290
Let's go to the beach.

727
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,420
Let's go to the beach.

728
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,020
Right now.

729
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,120
Let's go.

730
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,280
Let's go somewhere. Anywhere.

731
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:21,180
I'll go nuts if I don't.

732
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,400
At this hour?

733
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,370
Then I'll just go by myself.

734
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:28,110
Shall we?

735
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,060
Shall we go?

736
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,320
I can go, but you guys are...

737
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,370
Aren't you going to make
breakfast tomorrow?

738
00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:43,400
I don't want to get kicked out.

739
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:46,350
We can come back before morning.

740
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,260
I'm leaving right now.

741
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,250
Anyone want to join me?

742
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:53,250
Me! I'll drive.

743
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,030
Let's go to Sokcho.

744
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,080
I want to go there.

745
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:11,100
Where did they go?

746
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:16,040
They left without working!

747
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:31,180
I, Gyung Guk-Hee, is at the beach!

748
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,250
I'm here!

749
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,430
Su-Duk is here too!

750
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:39,410
I came when I should be cooking!

751
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,110
Hello, beach.

752
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,100
I haven't seen you in 7 years.

753
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,130
The stars look so pretty.

754
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:57,240
Lying here makes me feel
as though I'm back in the good 'ol days.

755
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,200
When?

756
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,470
My good 'ol days.

757
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,300
When was that?

758
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,230
Hmm....I wonder when that was.

759
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,390
Probably when I was seventeen.

760
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,130
Why seventeen?

761
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,040
Because I had a dream back then.

762
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:27,490
I wanted to be a charity worker.

763
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,460
I wanted to help people.

764
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:34,400
I wanted to adopt, and help orphanages.

765
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,010
You can help me.

766
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,130
Help me be skinny like you
even after eating a lot.

767
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:50,000
I can't even visit my family
because I'm divorced.

768
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,110
The neighbors don't want to
hang out with me either.

769
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:56,130
It's been 4 years
since I lived like a hermit.

770
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,270
I don't think I can help anyone.

771
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,470
I wanted to become a stewardess.

772
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:05,460
If I became a stewardess...

773
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:10,180
...I could be taking my family
on a plane trip right now.

774
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,310
You can still get on a plane.

775
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,060
I can't afford it.

776
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,470
Then go somewhere in Korea
with your family.

777
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,240
My husband doesn't want
to go anywhere with me.

778
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,110
He says he's embarrassed
because I'm fat.

779
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,090
You don't look too bad.

780
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,170
How about you?

781
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,070
What did you want to be?

782
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:37,310
I wanted to become a good wife.

783
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,160
You can still do that.

784
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,010
Just do it.

785
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:44,310
You're right.

786
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,060
It's hard to be a good wife.

787
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:51,130
That's the hardest thing you can be.

788
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,360
Take me for an example.

789
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:57,060
I can't believe I'm beating my kid now.

790
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,000
Why is everyone so depressed?

791
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,110
I don't want to go home.

792
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,320
Help!

793
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,220
What was that?

794
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,040
Jang-Mi!

795
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:46,440
Isn't that Jang-Mi?

796
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:55,170
Hey...let her go...

797
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,360
If you don't....if you don't....

798
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,320
What?

799
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,120
Are you telling me that
the real pervert got away?

800
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:33,160
Yes, he looked scary.

801
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,190
He saved me.

802
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:38,030
You were overreacting.

803
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,060
How scary.

804
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,290
He's here.

805
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,140
You're going to protect us, right?

806
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:55,240
Sure!

807
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,070
You're very polite.

808
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,120
You don't have to use honorifics.

809
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,160
We're not that much older than you.

810
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,100
What?

811
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,200
I think you guys are much...

812
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:16,050
Yongteurim?

813
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,090
That's a singing club!

814
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,400
Are you in college?

815
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,460
Yes, I'm in college.

816
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,350
No way...

817
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:31,220
She really is in college.

818
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,010
Me too.

819
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,150
These two aren't.

820
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,100
I see.

821
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,330
Since we're all in college,
I'll just drop the honorifics.

822
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:46,410
Okay, except for these two.

823
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,100
Hold on.

824
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,130
What language is that?

825
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:30,460
Are you a stewardess?

826
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:36,360
My father is an ambassador in Germany.

827
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,310
You must've lived all over the world.

828
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,440
I lived overseas with my parents
until I was in 7th grade...

829
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,310
...but I've lived in Korea even since then.

830
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,090
Why were you in Korea?

831
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,330
Because I like my friend.

832
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:54,310
Lucky you.

833
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,190
You got to travel all over the world.

834
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:03,000
You must've been lonely living
by yourself at such a young age.

835
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,110
Why?

836
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,200
Do I have something on my face?

837
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,490
No one has ever said that to me before.

838
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,220
Let's drink.

839
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,170
Cheers!

840
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:36,480
Nice to meet you all.

841
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,040
I need to use the restroom.

842
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:08,140
<i> I, I had a dream.</i>

843
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:16,490
<i> Although it had been
tattered and torn into rags</i>

844
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:35,470
<i> I treasured my dream inside my heart</i>

845
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:42,310
<i> At times, I had to withstand</i>

846
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:52,160
<i> The smirks they took behind my back.</i>

847
00:57:52,480 --> 00:58:08,370
<i> I can take it because
I'm waiting for another day.</i>

848
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:16,330
<i> One of these days,
I will leap over that wall</i>

849
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:26,030
<i> And fly over the sky.</i>

850
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:34,360
<i> Even this heavy world
is not strong enough to bind me.</i>

851
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:47,080
<i> Join me and smile
with me on that last day.</i>

852
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,300
Keep it up!

853
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,160
Keep it up! Keep it up!

854
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:04,210
Next, is Gyung Guk-Hee!
Gyung Guk-Hee!

855
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,070
One, two, three, four!

856
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:12,220
<i> I know you've got
someone else on your mind</i>

857
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:14,050
<i> And I know it.</i>

858
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:19,230
- Keep it up!
- <i> My intuitions are never wrong.</i>

859
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,090
<i> Do you know how worried I am?</i>

860
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:29,420
<i> If you know how I feel, then you
better not mess with me anymore.</i>

861
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:35,420
<i> I sometimes get tempted
from other fine men out there.</i>

862
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,050
<i> If you keep trying to lie to me,</i>

863
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,300
<i> Pretending as if you're the
only one capable of pulling this off,</i>

864
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:49,020
<i> Then I don't feel the need
to be loyal to you anymore.</i>

865
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:51,490
<i> I'll just leave you.</i>

866
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,160
I didn't know when we were
taking out the trash.

867
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,350
You must've been pretty
rowdy in your heydays.

868
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,030
What?

869
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:14,000
Do you want me to bring more firewood?

870
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,020
Yes.

871
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,020
Hold on.

872
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:29,170
It's almost time to go home.

873
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,310
I don't want to go home.

874
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,050
I guess we have to.

875
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:39,120
I have to go and make breakfast.

876
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:42,090
Nothing will change.

877
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:53,070
Everyone will expect me to do everything, but no one will give us credit.

878
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:59,110
I won't have a day of rest in that house.

879
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,490
I guess I'll grow old like this.

880
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:13,090
My life's not going to change.

881
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,160
Why isn't the other girl back
from the restroom yet?

882
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,140
Right, she's been gone for a long time.

883
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,420
Maybe...

884
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,070
Maybe what?

885
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:38,040
Maybe she met that pervert again!

886
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,050
Yun-Shil, are you inside?

887
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,100
Yun-Shil...

888
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,340
I don't think she's here.

889
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:04,030
Let's look for her somewhere else.

890
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:05,130
Okay.

891
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,150
Yun-Shil!

892
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:12,450
Where are you?

893
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:14,150
Answer me!

894
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:16,080
Yun-Shil!

895
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,090
Yun-Shil!

896
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,470
Where are you?

897
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,280
Yun-Shil!

898
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:28,460
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil!

899
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:30,280
Where are you?

900
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:36,000
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil!

901
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,220
Answer me!

902
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:51,010
Yun-Shil!

903
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:53,450
Yun-Shil!

904
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,220
Answer me!

905
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,080
Yun-Shil!

906
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,460
Yun-Shil!

907
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:05,150
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil!

908
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:09,330
Yun-Shil...

909
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,440
Yun-Shil...

910
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:16,440
Yun-shil!

911
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,390
What are we going to do?

912
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,160
We can't find her.

913
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,460
It's almost morning.

914
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,100
Su-Duk needs to go and make breakfast.

915
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,110
Oh, no...

916
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,040
Call her.

917
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,040
I don't know her number.

918
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,050
Do you?

919
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,120
No.

920
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,300
Wait, she called her cell phone with my phone because she couldn't find hers.

921
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,450
Really?

922
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,160
I found it!

923
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,410
It is me?

924
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:54,290
No.

925
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:56,030
I think it's from the restroom.

926
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,400
But we were here before.

927
01:03:58,180 --> 01:03:59,310
I'm scared.

928
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:03,000
What if something goes wrong?

929
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
My husband will kill me if he finds out.

930
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,420
Who wanted to come here
in the first place?

931
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,070
Be quiet!

932
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,130
Maybe she fell asleep.

933
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,450
Let's go.

934
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,370
I'll take the lead.

935
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,110
I'll call her again.

936
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:27,490
I'm too scared.

937
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:29,210
Hurry. Come on.

938
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,040
Yun-Shil.

939
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:36,410
Yun-Shil!

940
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:37,380
Are you still here?

941
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:43,000
Are you sleeping?

942
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,060
Hey Yun-Shil.

943
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:56,290
Yun-Shil... Yun-Shil...

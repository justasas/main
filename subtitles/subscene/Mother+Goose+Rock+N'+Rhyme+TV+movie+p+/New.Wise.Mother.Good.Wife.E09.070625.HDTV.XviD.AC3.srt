00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,200
- Episode 9 -

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,440
Did you bring all the paperwork?
And your ID?

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,470
- I brought them.
- Let's go.

4
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,500
Hey...

5
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,350
What?

6
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,250
Guk-Hee?

7
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,140
She has a million dollars
in her bank account?

8
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:47,250
Are you 100% positive?

9
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,170
Okay, bye.

10
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:57,330
Yun-Shil couldn't have opened a bank account because she's officially dead.

11
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,270
One million dollars, here I come.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,170
Wait a minute...

13
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,230
Do you consent to the divorce,
Ms. Gyung Guk-Hee?

14
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,220
Yes.

15
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,170
Do you consent to the divorce,
Mr. Hur Myung-Pil?

16
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,100
Mr. Hur Myung-Pil?

17
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,530
Huh?

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,510
- What are you doing?
- Do you consent to divorce?

19
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,350
Do you?

20
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,500
I'm not sure.

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,400
What?

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,150
You don't want a divorce?

23
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,150
I'm...not sure!

24
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,110
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,120
I can't help it.
I'm not sure!

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,270
I'm not sure about what I want either.

27
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,380
Let me think about it.

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,150
Hey! Hur Myung-Pil!

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,130
Are you joking?
This is ridiculous!

30
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,300
You're the one who wanted a divorce.

31
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:21,400
Yeah, I know... but I want
more time to think about it.

32
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,380
Don't you agree, sir?

33
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,400
You should've thought about it at home.

34
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,280
See? You're nuts.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,580
- I couldn't think at home...
- Both of you, get out! Now!

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,570
You're crazy.

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,200
1 million dollars...

38
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,310
Guk-Hee...

39
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,460
- Guk-Hee...
- Let go.

40
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,250
- I had my reasons.
- Reasons?

41
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,520
Guk-Hee!

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,590
The reason is...

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Gugi-dong, please.

44
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,470
Haven't you heard that saying?

45
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:39,390
Even a foolish man can come up with one good thought after 1,000 thoughts.

46
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,440
- So we should...
- Stop quibbling! Save it for Tae-Ran!

47
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,560
Hey, we're going the wrong way.

48
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,230
Hey, mister.

49
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,250
This is a taser.
Don't do anything stupid.

50
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,540
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out.

51
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,190
Ms. Guk-Hee.

52
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,330
- $ 1 million...
- What?

53
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,100
That's how much you have.

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,470
Guk-Hee, you need to wire the money.

55
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,540
- I don't know my PIN.
- Did you forget?

56
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,470
You can change it
with a photo ID and seal.

57
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't have my seal with me.

58
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,170
- Aim it at me.
- Whatever.

59
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,230
Aim it at me.

60
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:08,160
Don't be stubborn.

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,160
Forget it. Don't think I'll be grateful.

62
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,430
Just aim it at me.

63
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,140
Are you crazy?

64
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,180
Aim it at me, or else!

65
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,500
I don't need your help!

66
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,250
Let go.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,360
Aim it at me.

68
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,590
Hey...let go.

69
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,560
- Let's get the seal.
- Aim it at me.

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,170
- Hurry.
- Fine, I will.

71
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,460
- Sir?
- Yes?

72
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,360
May I see your hand?

73
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,580
Sorry, you can go now.

74
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,210
- Where should we go?
- This way!

75
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,290
Hey!

76
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,230
What's going on?

77
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,450
Wait a minute!

78
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,210
- Hurry up!
- I think it's this way!

79
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,580
Hang on...

80
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,380
They're fast as lightning.
Where did they go?

81
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,110
Sheesh...

82
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,180
- He should be gone by now, right?
- Probably.

83
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,190
Why do you have so much money?

84
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,340
- None of your business.
- Tell me.

85
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,380
- Huh?
- Huh? What's going on?

86
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,590
Oh, no!

87
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,420
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

88
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,140
- Excuse me, open up.
- Excuse me!

89
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,430
- Oh, no! Excuse me...
- Oh, no...

90
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,510
I can't see.

91
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,430
- Ow!
- Are you okay?

92
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,450
- Yeah. What's going on?
- Excuse me...

93
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,200
- Excuse me...
- Ow!

94
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,280
I knew it was you as soon as
I accessed my bank account.

95
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
White Pants must be going bonkers.

96
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,590
Tell me how I can help you.

97
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,170
Oh, that supermarket? Okay.

98
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,500
Okay, bye.

99
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,480
Do you like me?

100
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,220
Are you crazy?

101
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,210
Isn't that why you wanted
to be tasered instead of me?

102
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,590
Weren't you trying to protect me?

103
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,500
I know you liked it
when I was hugging you tight.

104
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,420
What's with you?
Do you want to see go mad?

105
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,180
It's freezing...

106
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,230
Aren't we getting a divorce?

107
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,170
I want to look back on our marriage.

108
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,430
Don't. We have nothing
but bad memories.

109
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:59,160
What kind of a husband was I?

110
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,250
You were demanding, got mad
when I made a mistake...

111
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,490
...and always criticized me.

112
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,220
So cold...

113
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:19,570
Let's be honest.
You weren't perfect.

114
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:29,120
I can't help but compare you to other top-notched career women.

115
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,350
No, I was just average.
I wasn't lacking anything.

116
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,460
- Don't say that to me.
- It's so cold.

117
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,280
Keep this in mind.
I...so cold...

118
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,180
I would've given my husband courage even if he wasn't the best.

119
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,260
I would've loved my husband
even if he were handicapped.

120
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,150
This is how we're different.

121
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,250
I have no intentions of getting
back together with you...

122
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,460
...so let's get it over with.

123
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,260
Oh my...

124
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,100
You scared me!

125
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,130
I'm sorry, mister.

126
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,540
This guy has a lot of money,
so ask him for the fare.

127
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,340
I'm freezing.

128
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,580
Where are we?

129
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,330
How could he say
he doesn't know in court?

130
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,540
Has he suddenly realized
how dear you are?

131
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,150
How could he be so selfish?

132
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,490
Should I tell that sly fox?

133
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,570
What about you?
Do you regret your decision?

134
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,300
What in the world are you talking about?

135
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,490
Guk-Hee, don't back out
on your decision!

136
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,100
We can't criticize her for
having second-thoughts.

137
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,490
They're married.
You never know what'll happen.

138
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,510
Do you want Guk-Hee
to get back with him?

139
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,170
- How absurd!
- Stop it!

140
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,580
That's easy for you to say.

141
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,510
Please calm down.

142
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm not going to get back with him.

143
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,470
I talked to Yun-Shil,
and I think she has a plan.

144
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,220
Just the thought of it makes me happy.

145
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,400
White Pants is going to be arrested soon.

146
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,340
Yun-Shil's plan is...

147
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,260
What is it?

148
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,280
- Ta-dah!
- Oh my eyes...

149
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,370
Wow!

150
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,240
This is...

151
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,480
It's a gift for you now that
you're officially mine.

152
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,230
Um...Tae-Ran.
This is...

153
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:25,230
This is nothing compared
to what you've done for me.

154
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,480
I forgot about all the difficult times.

155
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,200
Should we go somewhere to celebrate?

156
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:44,560
Tae-Ran...what about
having dinner at home?

157
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,530
But I'll cook for you.

158
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,490
There's nothing to eat at home.

159
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,520
Let's go grocery shopping.

160
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,450
Okay.

161
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,190
Yun-Shil's going to take
the money herself.

162
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,220
I wish we could see her.

163
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,250
She wants to come when the coast is clear. I'll tell her the locker number.

164
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,360
Hey, Yun-Shil. We put the money
in locker number 79.

165
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,280
Bye. Let's go.

166
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,230
Do you know how long
I've waited for this moment?

167
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,260
What moment?

168
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,260
You look happy.

169
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,350
- I guess it hasn't sunken in yet.
- What?

170
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,110
Will it hit you once the divorce papers have been processed?

171
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,120
You're completely clueless, aren't you?

172
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,500
- About what?
- Let's go grocery shopping.

173
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,400
We're hungry.
Let's go home and make dinner.

174
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,320
Hold on.

175
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,500
What do you mean, I'm clueless?

176
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,570
Uh..I think you should tell her, Myung-Pil.

177
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,160
I already told you!
I'm not going to write anymore!

178
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,430
Can you help me out?

179
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,330
Tae-Ran doesn't know we're not officially divorced. I'm dead if she finds out.

180
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,540
Please save me.

181
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,100
Then why didn't you divorce me?

182
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Give me just one more week.

183
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,160
I won't ask for more.

184
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,440
Please don't say anything for a week.

185
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,290
Didn't you tell me a camel stores
water to cross the desert?

186
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,280
Why do I have to be
the water for your survival?

187
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,300
Why am I the one
always helping you out?

188
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,130
Okay, I'm the camel.
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:24,340
Can you please keep it
a secret for just one week?

190
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,150
Here comes Tae-Ran.

191
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,320
What do I have to know?

192
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,350
Beats me.
Take a guess.

193
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,190
- Let's go, Suk-Doo.
- Okay.

194
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,250
Myung-Pil, what don't I know?

195
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:52,380
How would I know
what she's talking about?

196
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,370
Her brain is injected with Botox.

197
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:57,550
I divorced her because
we couldn't carry on a conversation.

198
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,170
Tae-Ran, pick out a bottle of wine
while I go to the restroom.

199
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,480
- Guk-Hee.
- Yeah?

200
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,220
- I need to go to the restroom.
- Okay.

201
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,570
Go ahead.

202
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,370
What a close call.

203
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,410
Jeez...

204
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,530
I feel sorry for you.

205
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,430
Why are you so shameless?

206
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:50,310
- What?
- Why are you so wishy-washy?

207
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,520
I can't stand seeing you.

208
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,210
Why don't you act your age?

209
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,120
What the heck?

210
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,420
Keep your promise and
finalize the divorce in a week.

211
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,120
If you don't, I'll make sure you pay.

212
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,340
Hey!

213
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,230
Don't tell me what to do!

214
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,550
Are you going to hit me again?

215
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,470
In front of Tae-Ran?

216
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,160
What a jerk!

217
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,220
You're dead meat if I see you again!

218
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,110
You don't scare me.

219
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,400
Why that...

220
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,180
Bye!

221
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,160
Those bastards!

222
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:58,150
They already withdrew all that money?

223
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,330
How could they be so sneaky?

224
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,360
Those slimeballs...
Why I should...

225
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,470
Hello?

226
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,520
It's me, Yun-Shil.

227
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,370
Y-y-yeah...

228
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,360
- Why aren't you here?
- I'm here.

229
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,120
Where's the money? Did you make Guk-Hee withdraw the money?

230
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,420
Let's negotiate.

231
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,360
Get me a valid passport, and I'll give
you half of my life insurance policy.

232
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,480
- Deal?
- Fine.

233
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,160
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

234
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,530
- Checking out your homepage?
- Yup.

235
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,370
- Wow, You have a lot of replies.
- I know.

236
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,270
- That's a nice picture.
- This one?

237
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,180
Yup.

238
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,370
- Guk-Hee.
- Yeah?

239
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,520
I have something to show you.

240
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,250
Okay.

241
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,460
Ta-dah!

242
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,110
- Turn your face.
- Lipstick...

243
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,580
Su-Duk!

244
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,150
How does she look?
I made some alterations.

245
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,560
You look so pretty!

246
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,230
You mean, this belonged to Su-Duk?

247
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,250
You look so pretty in fitted clothing.

248
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,150
- She's pretty.
- Really?

249
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,530
We should take pictures of her
and upload it online.

250
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,190
Who says everyone
has to be a size 0 or 2?

251
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:05,510
Let's show everyone that
sizes 6 or 8 can be beautiful too!

252
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,260
Let me make you more elegant
and fantastic. Let me see.

253
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,410
Turn this way. Look up!

254
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:56,240
What a nutcase! Did you really
say that in front of the judge?

255
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,500
I couldn't say I wanted
a divorce at that moment.

256
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,200
I wonder why?

257
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,120
I was on the hot seat.

258
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,100
Answer it.

259
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,170
Hello, Tae-Ran.
Did you finally submit your draft?

260
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,140
P-p-party?

261
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,460
O-o-of course we should
definitely celebrate.

262
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,560
Okay...bye, Tae-Ran.

263
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,460
Didn't you say you found
the perfect wife...

264
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,350
...after contemplating it
more than 1,000 times?

265
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,270
I'm going to give you some advice.

266
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,590
Snap out of it.
Don't be a two-timer.

267
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,500
Yummy.

268
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:14,100
What a relief.

269
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,340
Did you test-drive the car?

270
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,450
Why? You don't like it?

271
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,270
No...I'm just saving it.

272
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,130
Don't.

273
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,130
I should do something for you too.

274
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:48,280
Manage my paycheck. You can take allowance and pay the bills with it.

275
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,280
Use it as your allowance.

276
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,360
What?

277
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,230
I don't like it when wives
take the husbands' money.

278
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,420
One should spend one's
hard-earned money.

279
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,380
Spend your paycheck however you want.

280
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,360
Okay...

281
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,210
Myung-Pil... Myung-Pil...

282
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,340
- What?
- I'm...bored.

283
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,390
I see...should we go watch a movie?

284
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,210
Oh, I see...

285
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,500
Oh, that...of course, I know.

286
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,120
Myung-Pil!
Come here!

287
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,500
Wait a minute...Wait a sec, Tae-ran!

288
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,410
- What's wrong with you?
- Hang on.

289
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,210
- I'm tired.
- As if!

290
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,240
Tae-Ran!

291
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,190
Stay put. Come on!

292
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,210
Take it off.

293
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,100
What's wrong?

294
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,520
Do you have a problem?

295
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,320
Is there something you're not telling me?

296
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,460
Tomorrow, I'll find out
the ruling of the house.

297
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:45,140
I wonder if I can get the house...

298
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,280
Hey! We're going to go
buy a house right now!

299
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,430
It's a big house!

300
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,350
Let's go.

301
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,320
I need more than $20,000.

302
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,570
I want $60,000 more.

303
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,200
Why is it so hard to buy a house?

304
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,530
You take out the trash now?
Did you and Tae-Ran fight?

305
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,140
- Tomorrow's the ruling, right?
- Yup.

306
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:06,550
I wonder why I don't have a house
when I'm surrounded by houses.

307
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,370
I'm finally going to get
that house tomorrow.

308
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,270
Don't be disappointed if you can't.

309
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,560
- I'm going to appeal.
- Do you like going to court?

310
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,270
I'm just doing it my way.
No compromises.

311
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,510
I'm not going to
compromise with you either.

312
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,280
You have one week
to make up your mind.

313
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,200
Court

314
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,530
Gyung Guk-Hee

315
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,100
According to Article 565
Clause 1 of the Civil Code...

316
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,550
...when the buyer hands over money...

317
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:21,150
...in the name of contract fee
or security deposit...

318
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:28,460
...the seller has the right
to forfeit the contract...

319
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:42,370
...until it is carried out by paying a penalty of double the contract fee.

320
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:48,200
But in this case, Gyung Guk-Hee, the buyer, already paid the part payment...

321
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,180
...and brought the
remaining balance with her.

322
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,110
That means the buyer has
carried out the contract...

323
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,320
...which means the seller
cannot forfeit the contract.

324
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,100
Which means Cho Gyung-Soon, the seller, must carry out the contract.

325
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,140
Guk-Hee will cry if things don't work out.

326
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,510
What the heck am I doing here?

327
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,250
Should I just go?
I shouldn't be a two-timer.

328
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,590
Stop thinking... Guk-Hee...

329
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,490
Guk-Hee!

330
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,410
I can't believe it! I did it!

331
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,390
- That's great!
- You're so smart.

332
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:56,290
- Thanks, Suk-Doo.
- Guk-Hee, you're awesome.

333
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:58,180
Su-Duk...

334
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,380
<i> You can smile again </i>

335
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,150
<i> It's happy days </i>

336
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:53,290
<i> You should forget
all the bad and never cry </i>

337
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:59,100
<i> It'll be sunny days </i>

338
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:05,270
<i> I wish you the best </i>

339
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:16,330
<i> My friends are all gone </i>

340
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:31,250
<i> Why did you leave me?
Why do you have to leave me too? </i>

341
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,130
<i> There were...</i>

342
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:41,120
- Why?
- That's depressing!

343
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,100
Come out everyone!

344
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,130
Myung-Pil! Cheer up.

345
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:09,480
I'm not happy even though I have a trophy wife, imported car, golf clubs...

346
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,260
And I can use my
paycheck as an allowance.

347
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:21,360
- I don't want to go home.
- Have a drink and forget everything.

348
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,230
This is what you wanted.

349
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,350
She's going to kill me if I drink.

350
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,210
Fine then, you just worry.
I'll drink it.

351
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:49,120
<i> I want to cry. I so want to cry... </i>

352
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,160
Nice breeze and a full moon...
a perfect night for a date.

353
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,440
You're right.

354
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,350
Guk-Hee.

355
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:29,200
Um...here.

356
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:45,210
If you want, I can get the stars
and the moon for you.

357
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:54,200
This is all I can do for you right now,
but I'll eventually give you the world.

358
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:01,170
Suk-Doo, this is...

359
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,120
Guk-Hee...

360
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:15,100
Don't take it.
Just hold on to it.

361
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,490
Get off.
Let me park the car.

362
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,220
Why that!

363
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,160
Why that little...

364
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,380
I came here first.
Park somewhere else!

365
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,490
No, I'm going to park here.

366
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,200
I normally park here!

367
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,300
Why are you always so stubborn?

368
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,290
Don't give me advice!

369
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,380
Then don't pester Guk-Hee.

370
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,220
- That's between me and my wife.
- She's not your wife anymore.

371
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,560
You're unbelievable.

372
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,440
- Get out.
- Make me.

373
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,200
Fine, you want a piece of me?

374
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,580
Okay, you're dead meat!

375
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:17,400
- You...
- What the...

376
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,100
You... are...dead meat!

377
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,100
Why did you get into a car accident?

378
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,430
Were you trying to shoot a movie?

379
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,590
It seems like you're older...

380
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:26,240
Leave me alone,
I'm about to go bonkers!

381
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,390
Anyone who annoys me will pay!

382
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,320
- Myung-Pil.
- What?

383
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:48,410
I am young, so I don't have much.

384
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,320
You may not think I'm unreliable.

385
00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:02,200
But I have a bright future
that I want to spend with Guk-Hee.

386
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:11,130
You may think it's corny, but I even want to get the stars and the moon for her.

387
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:17,250
I want to succeed and
give everything to Guk-Hee.

388
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,170
That's how much she means to me.

389
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,230
I love Guk-Hee.

390
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,480
Please let her go.

391
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,550
I heard your car got messed up.

392
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,210
Why are you both so immature?

393
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:13,110
He made you upset, so I...

394
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm sorry.

395
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,340
I don't want you two to mingle.

396
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:32,200
Don't come here until
things settle down for me.

397
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,230
Hello?

398
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:48,340
This is Guk-Hee speaking.
The press?

399
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,100
Come to the Dongjak Bridge
on the 25th by 2:30 PM.

400
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,470
- Do you have plans?
- Yup.

401
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:15,260
- Are you going somewhere?
- Yeah.

402
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:20,190
- I have an important engagement.
- Really?

403
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:23,440
I'm going to head off.

404
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,470
Get Sniff off your trail and
I'll see you at 3pm on the 25th...

405
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:15,190
...at the place you proposed to me.

406
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:20,500
Yun-Shil, I'll finally going to meet you.

407
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,460
Why isn't she coming?

408
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,470
Yun-Shil...

409
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:50,120
You're looking good.

410
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,460
- Passport first.
- No way. Show me the money.

411
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,340
Should I call the cops?

412
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,120
Fine, fine.

413
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:21,540
Were you trying to pull
a fast one without me?

414
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,350
My money!

415
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,580
It's my money!

416
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,170
- It's my money!
- It's mine!

417
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,180
Where is she?

418
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,200
Wait, why did she tell us
both to meet her here?

419
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,390
She wanted us to fight each other and...

420
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:00,360
We're the police.
We need your cooperation.

421
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:28,350
Everyone, here's the money
for your drinks!

422
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,370
You need to win, sir.

423
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,290
I can't believe they conned me.

424
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:44,260
Fine, we'll see who wins.

425
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,560
Your article didn't get selected again?

426
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,490
Do you want to make a deal with me?

427
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,430
Deal?

428
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,570
Find me a candidate to be a good wife.

429
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:03,500
Can you introduce me to Tae-Ran?

430
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,420
I'll leak a good story to you in return.

431
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:14,140
This is actually for the Financial department, but we can write it too.

432
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,570
Think about it.

433
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,210
Ms. Gyung Guk-Hee?

434
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,100
Hello, my name is Han Chang-Sup
from the Financial Department.

435
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,540
Oh, hi.

436
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:53,300
I wanted to help other people
get their home back but...

437
00:43:53,300 --> 00:44:00,360
Can you blur me out because
I'm just a common housewife?

438
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,120
I know someone who works here too...

439
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,190
Ms. Gyung Guk-Hee's here with Mr. Han.

440
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,450
Your case was a hot topic.

441
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:15,380
Thanks to you,
there won't be any more victims.

442
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:19,320
Weren't you afraid to sue?

443
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,560
I was under a lot of pressure to buy
a house for the past 10 years.

444
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,470
I was steaming mad.

445
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,270
A lawsuit didn't intimidate me.

446
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,400
How did you prepare for the lawsuit?

447
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,130
I didn't have enough
money to buy a house.

448
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,380
I had to use my brain.

449
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:46,300
That's right, Botox on your brain.

450
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,380
Isn't that your wife?

451
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,310
What?

452
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:53,550
I looked up your website.

453
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,410
You wrote that you're not qualified
to be a good wife. Why not?

454
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:05,130
People have new expectations
for a good wife.

455
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:08,280
They want a woman who can
make money, buy a house...

456
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,430
...get green cards for their kids
and send them abroad.

457
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,520
Some even manage to stay in shape.

458
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,200
I can't do that.

459
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:21,520
Do you think it takes
money to be a good wife?

460
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,520
No, I don't think so.

461
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,300
Then what do you think
makes a good wife?

462
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,190
I'm still trying to find the answer.

463
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,200
I'll let you know once I find out.

464
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,230
Thanks.

465
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,530
Thanks for the interview.

466
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,460
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

467
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,230
I didn't know you'd be here.

468
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:11,480
You seemed like the smart
Guk-Hee I once knew.

469
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,200
I thought I didn't change...

470
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,410
...but I don't know what happened
with my marriage life.

471
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,560
I may have become like you too.

472
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:33,110
I wouldn't have been able
to handle all that.

473
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:43,130
You're supposed to make
your final decision today.

474
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,160
If you're not ready, I'll wait until tonight.

475
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,110
I read an essay that had
a paragraph about marriage.

476
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:08,430
A woman asked who'll
make a better husband.

477
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,290
There were two men
who wanted to marry her.

478
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:16,510
One man said he'll get the
stars and the moon for her...

479
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:22,330
...and the other said
he'll do his best to love her.

480
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,330
The man who said he'll get the stars
and the moon was an immature idealist.

481
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:36,490
The man who said
he'll do his best was a realist.

482
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,550
Guess which one the writer chose?

483
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:55,430
The idealist who'll do everything.

484
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:12,120
No one can get the stars or the moon, but he'll do his best to keep his promise.

485
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,230
If he can't, he'd at least be sorry.

486
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,290
That's the kind of a husband
a woman needs.

487
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:37,170
I think Suk-Doo's like that.

488
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:48,380
I'm a realist who always
tries to find a way out.

489
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,590
I'm sorry I hesitated at court.

490
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,240
I'll let you go.

491
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:58,570
This week, we want to get
the housewives' opinion on...

492
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,430
...what a wise mother and good wife is.

493
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,490
Women should...

494
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,200
Let's rank what conditions
need to be met.

495
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,210
I can't believe you're here to see me.

496
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:17,140
You gave me coffee before.

497
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:19,500
Study hard after drinking this.

498
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,120
This isn't energizing.
It's no chicken soup.

499
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:30,130
You're not immature.

500
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,350
I'm sorry for what I said yesterday.

501
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:41,370
I know that you're being sincere.

502
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:44,580
You should come by the house.
I'll make you dinner.

503
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:54,340
I need to stretch.

504
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,100
I'll make you something good.

505
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,490
Thanks.

506
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:03,470
Thank you. Good-bye.

507
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:04,510
Bye.

508
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,540
Seoul Family Court

509
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,420
Attendance Date?

510
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,260
Weren't they divorced?
What's going on?

511
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,120
You're completely clueless, aren't you?

512
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:53,310
Let's go grocery shopping. We're hungry. Let's go home and make dinner.

513
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,150
What is this?
They didn't divorce?

514
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,380
Tae-Ran

515
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,140
You won't answer my call? Fine.

516
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,360
Please leave a message after the beep...

517
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,180
Wake up.

518
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,370
Wake up!

519
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,250
Fatso! Are you nuts?

520
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:45,210
Why I should!

521
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,390
Here, read this.

522
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,580
These are what I need you
to do to make me happy.

523
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,100
- What is it?
- Read it.

524
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:08,190
- Call me Cutie instead of Fatso?
- Yup.

525
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,390
Thank me when I make you
something to eat.

526
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,140
Do I have to thank you whenever I eat?

527
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,520
Of course.

528
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,470
- Get rid of the reflection chair?
- Yup.

529
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:27,160
Oh, that's right.
I already smashed the chair.

530
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:32,570
- Fatso, are you out of your mind?
- Why I ought to!

531
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,270
It's Cutie! Cutie!

532
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,270
- Can you hurry?
- Sure.

533
00:54:55,450 --> 00:54:57,330
Hello?

534
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,440
What?

535
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,530
You didn't catch Kim Jo-Han?

536
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:07,170
No one was there.

537
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,440
Yes. Ma'am...

538
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,450
- Are you sure?
- Then suite 103 is in danger.

539
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,230
Why should I believe you?

540
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:22,240
They're after that house.
You need to go immediately!

541
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:27,410
Can you tell me who you are?

542
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:49,580
Don't do this to me.
I don't know anything!

543
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:52,350
Fine, fine, fine.

544
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,440
Then bring someone who does.

545
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,500
Guk-Hee!

546
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,350
Open up, Guk-Hee!

547
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,250
Guk-Hee!

548
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,490
Open up! Now!

549
00:56:23,370 --> 00:56:26,590
Where are you?

550
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,350
Hey sly fox!
Why are you here?

551
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:34,410
Where's Guk-Hee?

552
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:36,440
Why should I tell you?

553
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,300
- Tell me!
- Hey, be quiet!

554
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,490
Why are you always fighting?

555
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:45,250
You're so weird.

556
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:50,190
If you lay a finger on me,
you're going to pay for it!

557
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:53,120
- Whatever.
- Be quiet, shorty.

558
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,160
Hey!

559
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,560
Don't do that to her.
She's my wife!

560
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,460
Tie them up!

561
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,430
Tie me up separately!

562
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:10,300
Jang-Mi, my interview was great.

563
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:18,590
So there you are, Guk-Hee.

564
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,440
What are you doing?

565
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,360
Let go!

566
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,560
Why are you here?

567
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,440
You didn't get a divorce, right?

568
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,400
- What happened at court?
- Why are you asking me?

569
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,340
Is this what a married couple's like?

570
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,550
- You make me sick!
- What?

571
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:48,110
I don't believe this.
What do you think you're doing?

572
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,420
Hey, hey, hey! Be quiet!

573
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:54,500
- You always fight!
- You guys are so weird!

574
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,430
Why do you keep on bickering
whenever you meet?

575
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:01,530
Tape their mouths shut!

576
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:15,380
Guess what I did to my husband?

577
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:24,240
Hey, hey, hey! Come here.

578
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,140
How could you miss her?

579
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:30,320
Don't come near me!

580
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,530
Grab her!

581
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:36,130
Come here.

582
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:46,110
Get her!

583
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,300
Jang-Mi!

584
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,170
Hang on, why I ought to...

585
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:58,260
Why are you giving me a headache?

586
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,540
Jang-Mi!

587
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:09,480
Oh my... oh my!

588
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:15,370
My eye...

589
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,580
Jang-Mi!

590
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,430
What's the matter?

591
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:43,400
A hostage situation
took place at suite103.

592
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:45,390
What?

593
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:53,250
Myung-Pil...there's a murderer
at your wife's place!

594
00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:55,510
- What?
- I heard someone died.

595
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:58,230
- Who died?
- Pardon me?

596
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:03,430
- Your wife...
- Guk-Hee?

597
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,460
Guk-Hee!

598
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,410
- Myung-Pil...
- Guk-Hee!

599
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:13,400
Guk-Hee, don't die!

600
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,310
I love you, Guk-Hee...

601
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:21,390
You were my one and only love!

602
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:30,480
I don't want to divorce you,
but I didn't have the nerve to tell you...

603
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,480
I can't live without you...

604
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,500
I'll die with you!

605
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,310
What are you doing?

606
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,410
Guk-Hee!

607
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:42,100
Guk-Hee! You're alive!

608
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,300
Tae-Ran?

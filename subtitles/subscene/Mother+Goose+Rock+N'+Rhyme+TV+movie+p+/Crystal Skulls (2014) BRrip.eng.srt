1
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:02,495
There it is.

2
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,510
What we know is that last night,

3
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,213
here at the National Museum
in Washington D.C.,

4
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,790
an artifact known as one
of the infamous crystal skulls

5
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:21,848
was stolen.

6
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,455
This is apparently not
the first crystal skull to be taken

7
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,530
and, according to the museum's director,

8
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,693
there have been at least six skulls
in the past two years

9
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,031
from museums and collections
from across the globe

10
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,566
that have disappeared
under nefarious circumstances.

11
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:38,275
For CNB News this is Joshua O'Dell.

12
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:12,625
Senor.

13
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,462
Salut.

14
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,750
I assume it's authentic.

15
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:30,322
Without a doubt.

16
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,752
You see, my employer
would be very disappointed

17
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:35,621
if it turned out to be a forgery.

18
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,129
How did you obtain the artifact?

19
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,667
Given the nature of my business,

20
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,362
you can understand why
I cannot reveal such details.

21
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,473
There are strict regulations
about the transport

22
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,077
and sale of such antiquities.

23
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,473
Again, my employer would be very-

24
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,709
Your employer either wants what
I have to offer or he does not.

25
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:02,110
In which case,
I have other buyers to meet.

26
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,581
You didn't travel 200 miles up
into the Andes

27
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:08,593
if you had other buyers.

28
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:13,360
Then we are ready to do business?
Yes?

29
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,197
When you contacted our representative,

30
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:22,297
your message included
a certain purchase price.

31
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,040
And I believe the amount
was more than fair.

32
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,737
As does my employer.

33
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,036
Do you have the item with you?

34
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,581
I'm not a fool, Mr. Mitchell.

35
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:34,846
But it is close by.

36
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,922
Do you have the money?

37
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,555
I'm not a fool either.

38
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,763
Follow me.

39
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:20,456
You going to count it?

40
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,462
That will not be necessary.

41
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,629
Then, my friend,

42
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:28,766
we're finished here.

43
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:11,742
What you have feared has come true.

44
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,776
And what have I feared?

45
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,477
He's gathering the skulls.

46
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,349
He understands
that together they have power.

47
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,512
Who?

48
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:20,718
The rich man.

49
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:22,526
The infidel, Hadden.

50
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,183
He's an old man,

51
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:26,824
a foolish man
who is driven by dreams of power

52
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,591
derived from the skulls.

53
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,965
He is a dangerous man,
you understand?

54
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,494
Yes, I understand,
but the real danger is that

55
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:34,504
without the thirteenth skull

56
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,562
there will be no way to control them.

57
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,338
The other twelve could become unstable

58
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,944
and cause massive destruction.

59
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,547
This is why the brotherhood
has given you a task.

60
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,671
There will be bloodshed.

61
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:46,876
Are you asking me for my
approval or my opinion?

62
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,179
I don't need your approval.

63
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,785
Then my opinion is
that there is no need for violence,

64
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,516
he just needs to be stopped.

65
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,156
You're a fool to believe a rich man
can be stopped

66
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,755
without bloodshed.

67
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,036
I understand you have a mission
and I wish you good luck,

68
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,663
but don't let your anger
poison you, Hussein.

69
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,474
Check all your equipment.

70
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:20,545
You sure we have enough rope?

71
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,481
You sure there's something down there?

72
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,355
I wouldn't be doing this

73
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,022
if I didn't think there
was something down there.

74
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,753
You know how I feel about heights, Terry.

75
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,555
Don't worry about it.

76
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,023
Have I ever let you down?

77
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,460
Three, four times, tops.

78
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:33,154
Climbing is my business.

79
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,190
You're just gonna have to suck it up.

80
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,837
Look at that, bro.

81
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,567
Go easy...

82
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,338
...over the lip.

83
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:52,538
Whooo!

84
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,952
Go steady, bro.

85
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,545
Look at that!

86
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,347
Yeah.

87
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,517
Holy cow.

88
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,750
It was here.

89
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,916
Yeah? How can you be so sure?

90
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,462
This is the last place
in his notebook that he visited.

91
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,932
After living with his obsession
with the thirteenth skull

92
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,468
For all these years,

93
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,634
we're finally going to find it.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,660
After you.

95
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,606
You're the archaeologist.

96
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,005
Well, you're the adventurer.

97
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,807
The wife would argue with that.

98
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,141
She says I'm a glorified tour guide.

99
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,070
So guide.

100
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,579
Ok, brother.

101
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,855
There's no GPS down here so
I'm working off old maps.

102
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:15,429
It's down this cave another
couple hundred meters.

103
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:19,161
You sure dad was here?

104
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:21,097
He describes this tunnel.

105
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:26,102
For all we know,

106
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,803
what's left of him is lying
around down here somewhere.

107
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,484
We owe it to him to
find whatever it was he was after.

108
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,278
You ready for that?

109
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,613
I'm ready for that.

110
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,810
You ready for that?

111
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,612
I guess so.

112
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,120
We'll be alright.

113
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:46,395
If you say so, brother.

114
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:48,621
After you.

115
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,226
Is everything ready?

116
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:27,032
Yes, they've been awaiting your arrival.

117
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:28,094
Any problems?

118
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,539
Me? No.

119
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,610
Bloke I got this from might
have a different opinion.

120
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:32,698
Why's that?

121
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,845
I don't think you want to know that,
Ms. Mallory.

122
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,277
The lab has been built eight
levels underground.

123
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:41,574
You expecting trouble?

124
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,676
Let's hope not.

125
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,125
Watch yourself.

126
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,259
This way.

127
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,628
Watch your feet.

128
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:14,307
HEY,

129
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,583
looks like we found something.

130
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,380
We did, didn't we?

131
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,613
After you.

132
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:22,823
Age before beauty.

133
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,829
Is that him?

134
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,542
You didn't think he'd miss
this moment, do you?

135
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,771
Mr. Hadden?

136
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,577
Mr. Mitchell.

137
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:21,974
<i>Bravo .</i>

138
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,209
Thank you, sir.

139
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,020
I don't know how much time
I may have left,

140
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:31,060
so let's not waste any more of it.

141
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,399
Is that normal?

142
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,142
Well, as far as we're aware,

143
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,679
this is the first time
the skulls have been reunited

144
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,146
in the history of mankind.

145
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,444
What's happening?

146
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:00,642
There's sonic vibration at sixteen hertz.

147
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,748
I feel a little sick.

148
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,550
I don't know how they're doing it,

149
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:07,023
but these things are generating
their own magnetic field.

150
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,284
That's not possible.

151
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:09,718
Tell them that.

152
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,297
What's it say?

153
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,435
Thursday night is ladies night.

154
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,506
All women will be admitted, no cover.

155
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,069
All drinks two shackles.

156
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,236
What?

157
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,537
I have no idea.

158
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,109
But they're in dad's book.

159
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:40,549
Twelve distinct symbols.

160
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,455
How can you know that, smart guy

161
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,120
if you don't even know what they say.

162
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,762
Well, I don't need to be
able to translate them

163
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:49,868
in order to know that is Acadian,

164
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,194
this is Egyptian,

165
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,066
those over here I don't really recognize.

166
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,298
This, this looks pre-Colombian.

167
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,409
Most likely Mayan.

168
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,343
South American?

169
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:01,707
What the hell's it doing here?

170
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,075
Exactly.

171
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,712
Pre-Babylonian, Sumerian,
we've got Egyptian, possibly Mayan.

172
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,483
My guess is it's twelve
different groups

173
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,682
representing a different
early civilization.

174
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,794
So what's the thirteenth for?

175
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,124
I mean, you've got
twelve sets of symbols,

176
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,994
twelve ancient civilizations,
twelve skulls.

177
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,695
If there really is a thirteenth skull,

178
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:24,857
what's that about?

179
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,433
That, my friend, is a good question.

180
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,404
I really have no idea at this point,

181
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,033
but I'm sure I'm gonna find out.

182
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,945
I think I'm gonna puke!

183
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,918
Yeah, it's the frequency.

184
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,753
Certain modulations cause nausea.

185
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:49,952
At seven hertz,
it can cause your body to come apart

186
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,222
at a nuclear level.

187
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:54,623
Is off the scale!

188
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,088
We're gonna lose it.
Clear the room.

189
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,423
Clear the room!

190
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,077
Get them out of there!

191
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,306
We've tried to activate the shut-down-

192
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,176
Just do what I tell you!

193
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,424
Whoa.

194
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,492
Whafd you touch?

195
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,571
Nothing! I didn't do anything!

196
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:35,947
I told you not to touch anything!

197
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,508
Wow.

198
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,559
Code Level Red

199
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,200
Colonel, the pulse has dissipated.

200
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,241
Do we have any reports
of a nuclear detonation?

201
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,398
Negative, sir.

202
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,031
Nothing?

203
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,066
No, sir.

204
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:14,869
Nothing.

205
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,105
Satellite or seismic.

206
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,111
Then what the hell was it?

207
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,682
We've picked up
an electro-magnetic burst,

208
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,344
and it appears it's originated in Vienna.

209
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,343
Vienna?

210
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,881
Vienna, Austria?

211
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,548
As in Mozart and chocolates?

212
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,684
That's correct, sir.

213
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,649
Alright.

214
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,391
Commander of the watch,
take us back to yellow.

215
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,420
Yes, sir.

216
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:38,358
Electra-magnetic pulses
don't just come out of nowhere.

217
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,630
Roger that, sir.

218
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,728
Major.

219
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,011
Tell the joint chiefs they'll know what
it was when I know what it was.

220
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,670
All of it is back to normal except...

221
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,744
The skulls are still generating a field.

222
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
Exactly.

223
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,409
They're holding steady for the moment, but-

224
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,503
You saw what happened.

225
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,642
Yes, of course.

226
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:32,284
Well, we knew that the skulls possess
unique magnetic qualities.

227
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,222
If your theory was correct,
the thirteenth should have-

228
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:37,452
Should have been able
to control the others.

229
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,726
The theory isn't the problem.

230
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:44,763
The problem is that that
wasn't the thirteenth skull.

231
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:48,631
You're not blaming
this cock-up on me, are you?

232
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:53,039
Who exactly should we blame
for this unmitigated disaster,

233
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,133
Mr. Mitchell?

234
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:54,744
Mr. Hadden-

235
00:18:54,934 --> 00:19:00,043
You vouched for the authenticity
and you delivered a forgery.

236
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,950
Mr. Hadden, I'm really sorry
but in my line of work

237
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,420
people have a tendency to lie.

238
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,023
Is that so, Mr. Mitchell?

239
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:09,525
I was going on information
supplied by your contacts, sir.

240
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:14,156
Yes, and you were supposed to vet
this information, am I correct?

241
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,855
Yes, sir.

242
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,768
You could have gone
and interrogated the chap

243
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,806
who gave it to you,
but that would have been too difficult,

244
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,237
wouldn't it?

245
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,131
Yes, sir.

246
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:35,180
Everybody makes mistakes.

247
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:38,955
Thank you, Mr. Hadden.

248
00:19:39,612 --> 00:19:43,355
Don't ever make another one.

249
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:46,652
Yes, sir.

250
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:49,794
Go and get the real skull.

251
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,692
Go with him.

252
00:19:54,828 --> 00:19:56,432
There isn't a lot of time.

253
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:04,711
I want the families of those
two men who died

254
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,545
taken care of.

255
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,007
Yes, sir.

256
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,889
A strange electrical disturbance

257
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,482
rocked Vienna, Austria last night

258
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:15,992
with power outages...

259
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,991
...There was a large blast
in the centre of the city...

260
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:20,825
...Coming in now,
the French NATO troops

261
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,389
high alert following...

262
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:23,431
...BMP...

263
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,059
...Any word from
city or government officials...

264
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,706
...Have refused to comment on this...

265
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,205
...Government officials
on what has caused this...

266
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,540
...Detonation of an atomic weapon...

267
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:36,042
...What seems to be a high-profile meeting

268
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:36,306
with the president...

269
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,248
I'm Melanie Cox,
live from Vienna, stay with us.

270
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:49,748
Wow.

271
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,483
Cool.

272
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,623
Be careful what you touch,
things could be booby-trapped.

273
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,547
Sorry, bro.

274
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,964
<i>It's dad's ring.</i>

275
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,293
You were right.

276
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,128
No, no, don't touch it!

277
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:38,041
What did I just tell you?

278
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,669
I didn't touch anything!

279
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:44,370
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

280
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:49,678
Let's get out of here!

281
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,981
Go!

282
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,253
Hurry, John!

283
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:14,705
Ok, come on.

284
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,115
Clip in.

285
00:22:31,617 --> 00:22:32,617
You in?

286
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,321
- All set.
- Ok.

287
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,487
Remote.

288
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:46,636
Slack is out.

289
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Come on.

290
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,168
What's wrong?

291
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:50,974
It's not working.

292
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,170
No.

293
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,441
Give me yours, we'll go together.

294
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,574
Clip in.

295
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:57,777
Come on, come on!

296
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:58,844
I'm sorry.

297
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,145
Whafre you doing??

298
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,384
Terry!

299
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:03,923
I'm sorry, brother.

300
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,391
We can do this together, come on!

301
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,865
Terry, don't do this!

302
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,363
It's the only way.

303
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,524
I'm sorry.

304
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:13,525
Terry!

305
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,037
I love you, man.

306
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,540
Terry!!

307
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:19,833
My brother always stood by me

308
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,371
even though he didn't always believe in

309
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,702
what I was doing.

310
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:36,509
I guess that's
what I'll miss most about him.

311
00:24:42,849 --> 00:24:44,157
Luh...

312
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,466
I want to thank everybody for
coming today

313
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:49,588
and paying your respects.

314
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,601
It would mean a lot to my brother.

315
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:55,628
Thank you.

316
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,737
Mommy, I miss my daddy.

317
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,918
I know you miss your daddy,
sweetie.

318
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,484
I miss your daddy, too.

319
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:15,685
And if there's anything
ever that you need,

320
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,459
you ask your Uncle John, ok?

321
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:20,622
Ok, Uncle John.

322
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,795
I guess it runs in the family.

323
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,629
What's that?

324
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,542
No body, no casket.

325
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,605
Laura, I'm so sorry.

326
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:37,641
L§

327
00:25:37,804 --> 00:25:39,181
It wasn't your fault.

328
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,151
He was my little brother.

329
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,556
I should have protected him.
He didn't have to come with me.

330
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,281
He looked up to you.

331
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:50,224
He would have followed you anywhere.

332
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,015
- Professor Winston?
- Not now, please.

333
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:23,758
- Hello, Professor Winston.
- Ladies.

334
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,323
Do you mind telling me what this is?

335
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,060
What's it look like?

336
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:35,271
It looks like my classes
have been cancelled.

337
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,837
That is what it says, yes.

338
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:39,737
Would you care to elucidate?

339
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,879
I don't understand why.

340
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,473
I thought after your brother's death

341
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,545
you might want some time.

342
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:48,176
Hmm.

343
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:49,512
No, I don't need time.

344
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,814
I just need to get back to my teaching.

345
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:56,123
It isn't quite that easy, John.

346
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,623
You're the head of the department,
Gerry.

347
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,931
Why don't you just make it that easy?

348
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,197
I'm the head of the department
who must answer

349
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,535
to the president of the college,

350
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,694
who in turn has to answer
to the board of trustees.

351
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,000
And what do the trustees
have to do with any of this?

352
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,337
You're the one who told these kids

353
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:16,878
about some
god forsaken crystal skull story.

354
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,643
Gerald, are you kidding me now?

355
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,545
It's just a theory.

356
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:21,673
You and I both know that.

357
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,448
That's right, a theory.

358
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,489
Isn't that what we're trying to do here?

359
00:27:25,578 --> 00:27:27,615
To help kids think for themselves?

360
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:34,123
One of the school's largest
donors objected.

361
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:35,453
My hands are tied.

362
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,764
So now donors dictate curriculum?

363
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,870
They were going to pull the funding, John.

364
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:41,436
All the funding.

365
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,673
We're talking fifty faculty jobs.

366
00:27:45,665 --> 00:27:46,700
Ok, alright.

367
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,472
Tell me who it is.

368
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,112
<i>I'll</i> talk to them,
maybe I can convince them, if-

369
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,578
No, there's no convincing them.

370
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:54,878
Their minds are made up.

371
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,186
You're a world class archaeologist,
John,

372
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,915
and a fine academic.

373
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,623
You had to know
that something like this

374
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,787
would catch up with you sooner or later.

375
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:14,027
John. I am truly sorry about this.

376
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,394
Me too.

377
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:38,418
He's been in there a long time.

378
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,622
Give it a few more minutes.

379
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:42,629
A few more minutes
and he'll have a bloody lap dance.

380
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,297
Alright, that's it.

381
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,069
Leave it any longer and he's
going to be absolutely smashed.

382
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,201
Look on the bright side.
You can carry him out.

383
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:55,744
I'm not going to have him
throw up on my brand new suit.

384
00:28:57,603 --> 00:28:58,603
Come on.

385
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,466
If you've got a pen, I'll sign it for you.

386
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,442
If you're lucky, some day
it'll be worth something.

387
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,514
Actually, our employer is very interested

388
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:31,909
in discussing it with you.

389
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:33,072
Alright,

390
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:37,520
what is his or her name?
I will make it out to he or she-

391
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,520
William Hadden.

392
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:44,357
H-A-D-D-E-N.

393
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,801
William Hadden?

394
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,336
The very wealthy technology fellow?

395
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,443
Yeah, that'd be the one.

396
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,501
Now what would he want with my book?

397
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,845
Not your book, mate.

398
00:30:05,404 --> 00:30:06,404
You.

399
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,173
Me?

400
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:14,622
Let's just say for the moment
that he has a very deep,

401
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,157
personal interest in the subject matter.

402
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:21,063
Well, perhaps you should tell Mr. Hadden

403
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,531
that he's slightly misguided.

404
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,306
Crystal skulls are a theory.

405
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:31,204
Apparently not a very good one.

406
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,041
Oh <i>s my'</i>

407
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,333
Well, what if we told you

408
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:36,412
it was a little more than just a theory.

409
00:30:37,636 --> 00:30:39,673
I'd say that you guys need another drink.

410
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:44,411
And by "you guys" I mean me.

411
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,610
Please.

412
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,656
It's me.

413
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,906
Yes, they are inside now.

414
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:08,469
I understand my mission.

415
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,646
They will not acquire
the thirteenth skull.

416
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:17,784
It sounds like you want
me to make a statement.

417
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:22,413
Fine.

418
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,618
It will be handled that way.

419
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:44,947
So I take it you don't want
me to sign the book?

420
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:48,477
Mr. Hadden would like you
to accompany us to Vienna.

421
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,883
He would like to talk to you in
person about the skulls.

422
00:31:54,546 --> 00:31:56,548
Vienna sounds lovely.

423
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,190
But unfortunately I've got some students,

424
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,821
lectures to attend to.

425
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,095
Really?

426
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,165
Because we heard you've
been given a sabbatical

427
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:06,567
from your teaching obligations.

428
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:08,836
Oh, you heard about that?

429
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:11,204
Mr. Hadden was the one that relieved you

430
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:12,673
of those obligations.

431
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:14,466
Now why would he want to do that?

432
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,442
He's got bigger fish to fry, no?

433
00:32:17,236 --> 00:32:18,306
He wants you to come to Vienna

434
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,509
to discuss you and
your father's life's work.

435
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,575
He thought it would
be better if he had your

436
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:28,588
Get him out!

437
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,624
Up the stairs! Go!!!!

438
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:47,736
Who was that guy
and why was he shooting at you?

439
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:50,312
He wasn't shooting at me,
he was aiming for you!

440
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,539
He was what?

441
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:53,646
The thirteenth skull is still out there

442
00:32:53,706 --> 00:32:54,741
and there are people
who would do anything to stop it

443
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:55,908
from being found.

444
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:57,477
Including fanatics like that guy.

445
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,180
Well if Hadden wanted
my undivided attention,

446
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,824
he certainly has it now.

447
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:02,585
Go, go!

448
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,111
I want updates on the Vienna pulse.

449
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,847
There's still an electro-magnetic signal

450
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:28,645
being generated from the location, sir.

451
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:29,945
What's the source?

452
00:33:30,109 --> 00:33:31,213
No way to tell yet, sir.

453
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,287
Signal strength is holding steady,

454
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:34,619
no signs of dissipating.

455
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,754
So they're still capable of
generating another pulse?

456
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:38,883
Yes, colonel.

457
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:41,387
If the second one is stronger,

458
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,160
they could black out half of Europe.

459
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:45,360
Notify local authorities
on the ground in Vienna.

460
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,863
And I want a go team
assembled in 15 minutes on the pad.

461
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,146
How much longer?

462
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,450
We land at Heathrow,
and then we're going on a chopper

463
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,748
for the final leg to Vienna.

464
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:05,843
A chopper?

465
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:07,955
I kinda like the jet.

466
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:10,692
The EMP burst nearly
dropped every plane from the sky

467
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,559
around Vienna, so,
for our own protection,

468
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,791
we're switching to a form of travel

469
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,160
that's a little less precarious.

470
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:19,269
A little less precarious?

471
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,827
Lower your weapons!

472
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,804
Put 'em down! Now!

473
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,498
Go to the left.

474
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:00,239
Move!

475
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:02,642
The rest of you men, on me.

476
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,090
That's far enough, Colonel.

477
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,889
Order your men to lower their weapons.

478
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,427
You lower your weapons, sir.

479
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,825
This is a private property and therefore

480
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,955
you have no authority
to enter this facility.

481
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24,255
Really?

482
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,584
I'm the United States Army
commanding NATO forces.

483
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,265
I've got the authority
to call in a damn air strike

484
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,931
on this building if I wanted to.

485
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,702
You really want to go down that road?

486
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,680
You're out-gunned, son.

487
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:41,911
Tell your men
to put their weapons down

488
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,953
and no one gets hurt

489
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:57,455
Alright.

490
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,564
So, who's in charge of this facility?

491
00:36:01,393 --> 00:36:03,304
That would be me.

492
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,510
Colonel Bailey, I assume?

493
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:08,611
I'm afraid, sir,

494
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,839
that there's going
to be a change of command.

495
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,577
This is a private research facility

496
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:16,310
wholly owned by Hadden Enterprises,

497
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:20,284
which is a private company
wholly owned by me.

498
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:21,756
What it is, Mr. Hadden,

499
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,556
is the site of an unauthorized
electro-magnetic pulse.

500
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,325
I'm authorized by NATO

501
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:30,525
to seize control of this
wholly owned facility

502
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:33,167
until I know what
the hell is happening here.

503
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:36,365
I will be filing a formal
complaint with the EU.

504
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,073
You do that, sir.

505
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:40,473
Until I hear otherwise, Mr. Hadden,

506
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:42,935
there's a new sheriff in town.

507
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,152
So this is the best a billionaire

508
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:58,819
could come up with, huh?

509
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,953
An old military-style helicopter?

510
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,596
They have far less electronics,
which makes them safer to fly

511
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,964
when you have problems with EMP.

512
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,471
That's very comforting.

513
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:14,341
Sienna, I was wondering...

514
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:17,037
what's Hadden's obsession
with the crystal skulls?

515
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,107
You need to ask him about that.

516
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,315
If I get a chance, I will.

517
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:27,592
We have breaking news here.

518
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:30,556
It has just been confirmed
that the electrical

519
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:33,153
disturbance that caused
recent power outages

520
00:37:33,252 --> 00:37:35,858
across western Europe did in fact center

521
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:38,623
from Hadden Industries
research facilities...

522
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,195
...As you may remember,
the owner of Hadden Industries

523
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,672
is billionaire, William S. Hadden,

524
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:45,909
a man who recently
shocked Wall Street

525
00:37:46,031 --> 00:37:48,841
when he decided to sell
all of his US interests

526
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,134
to pursue European projects...

527
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:53,512
...As you may recall,
the Hadden facility is the same facility

528
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,553
associated with the EMP blast
that blacked out

529
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:58,177
most of western Europe.

530
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,587
We are awaiting an official
statement and comments

531
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:02,487
from Hadden representatives,

532
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:04,084
given the nature of the incident,

533
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:05,991
on what exactly happened.

534
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,287
What's going on?

535
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,762
The magnetic field is growing.

536
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,358
Faster than the last one?

537
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,492
Exponentially.

538
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,470
What the hell is this?

539
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,403
There's nothing
we can do to control the reaction.

540
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,635
It's breaking away.

541
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:24,437
Can someone please explain
what I am looking at?

542
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:28,747
These are twelve crystal skulls
gathered from around the world,

543
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,484
brought together for the first time.

544
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,681
What in God's name are
you talking about?

545
00:38:33,112 --> 00:38:35,524
I'm telling you
that there's going to be another

546
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,618
electro-magnetic pulse,
larger than the first one.

547
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,457
Generated by these crystal skulls?

548
00:38:43,588 --> 00:38:44,589
Yes.

549
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,467
And there isn't anything
we can do to stop it.

550
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,833
Well I'm going to stop it.

551
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,635
Weapons free, destroy the skulls.

552
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,902
Colonel, no.

553
00:38:52,965 --> 00:38:53,965
Colonel, please!

554
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,038
You have no idea what you're doing!

555
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,771
Fire!

556
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,766
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

557
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:26,464
What the hell was that?

558
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,909
Some kind of electronic pulse fried us.

559
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,506
I thought that this old chopper
was protected from that?

560
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:34,344
Navigation systems have protection,

561
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:37,043
but the fuel pumps were updated last year.

562
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,780
And you didn't think,
that when we needed a chopper

563
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:41,823
with pre-sold electronics,
that that might be an issue?

564
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,148
We've got no power?

565
00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:43,693
We're in a helicopter.

566
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,352
We're going to
fall like a stone from the sky.

567
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:45,962
No, no, no.

568
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,463
We can auto-rotate.

569
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,394
Auto-what?

570
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,433
Choppers are just like planes.

571
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,468
The blade on the top acts
like a giant wing except

572
00:39:54,426 --> 00:39:56,804
we've got to start diving
to make this work,

573
00:39:56,929 --> 00:40:00,308
and this is a really bad place
to auto-rotate and land.

574
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:02,402
We'll need to re-route
the power to the fuel pump.

575
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:04,241
Well how the hell
are we going to do that?!

576
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,196
Well, we can figure
something out back there.

577
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:08,516
You know how to do this?

578
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,545
We have to figure out
where the fuel pump is.

579
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,658
How long have we got until
we have to put this thing down?

580
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:17,224
At this rate of descent,
maybe another two minutes,

581
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:18,486
but we're going to have a hard landing

582
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:19,961
in the side of a mountain.

583
00:40:20,452 --> 00:40:21,452
I found a genie.

584
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:23,621
Power cables.

585
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,360
I found them right here.

586
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,594
Fuel pumps are up there.

587
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:27,966
Put it into this up here, look.

588
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,226
These are the fuel lines here?

589
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:30,261
Yeah.

590
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,683
We're not going to clear
the mountain range!

591
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,474
My job is to get these two people back,

592
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:36,704
we're not ditching!

593
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:38,636
Got it?

594
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:48,985
We've got engine power back!

595
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,091
Yes, nice!

596
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:50,888
That's awesome!

597
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,757
Excellent work, professor, excellent!

598
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:53,986
I think he's waking up.

599
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,154
Nice job, you save the poor bastard

600
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:57,596
and we get the chopper up!

601
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:59,835
Not too bad, if I say so myself!

602
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,741
No, no, no, no!

603
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:11,439
Oh, that's just brilliant,
bloody brilliant!

604
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,273
No gas!

605
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,078
You loaded a generator with no fuel?

606
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,741
Sorry, sir.

607
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,046
Just shut up!

608
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:20,211
I need you--

609
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:23,019
I want to thank you for inviting me
on this little adventure.

610
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,707
Professor--

611
00:41:45,771 --> 00:41:47,478
Move. move, move!!!!!

612
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:06,891
You alright?

613
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:09,566
That was a nice way to arrive in Europe.

614
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,198
Yeah, you're welcome, Professor.

615
00:42:11,296 --> 00:42:13,139
Now we've got to
find transport to Vienna.

616
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,816
What the hell just happened?

617
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,618
You attempted to destroy them.

618
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
There is no way to remove
them or destroy them.

619
00:42:32,617 --> 00:42:34,062
Do you now understand that,
Colonel?

620
00:42:34,653 --> 00:42:36,530
We're still online, Mr. Hadden.

621
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:37,998
Check redundant systems.

622
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:41,725
Sir,

623
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:44,672
I'm receiving a signal from the helicopter

624
00:42:44,796 --> 00:42:47,072
transporting doctors Mallory and Winston.

625
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,338
What kind of signal?

626
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,636
An emergency beacon.

627
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,108
The chopper is down.

628
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,474
Are there any casualties?

629
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,176
Any injuries?

630
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:56,944
Don't know, sir.

631
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:58,108
Dammit!

632
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,153
They must have flown
right through the pulse.

633
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,922
Get a location on the crash site.

634
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:02,620
Yes, sir.

635
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,192
Who was on this chopper?

636
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:07,387
Sienna Mallory,
my senior researcher,

637
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,261
and John Winston.

638
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:11,265
Winston? Professor John Winston?

639
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:12,561
Yes, Colonel.

640
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:16,164
He might just be the only one
who can stop this.

641
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,463
But presently my only concern

642
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,268
is for Miss Mallory's well-being.

643
00:43:20,866 --> 00:43:22,812
I just lost four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

644
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:26,348
I'm not particularly concerned
with your personal decadences.

645
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,621
Sienna Mallory is my daughter,
Colonel.

646
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,082
So please,

647
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,860
use whatever resources
you have at your disposal

648
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:43,558
and get them here as soon as possible.

649
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:46,694
Give my men those coordinates
and I'll send a recovery team.

650
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:47,859
Yes, sir.

651
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,799
Mr. Hadden, I'm sorry.

652
00:43:52,264 --> 00:43:53,641
I'm a father as well.

653
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:55,067
Thank you, Colonel.

654
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:57,403
Apology accepted.

655
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,979
Colonel! You have to see this!

656
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,923
I've just arrived here in Berlin
where members of the G8

657
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,483
are now gathering for what seems
to be an emergency meeting

658
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:15,224
regarding these strange
weather phenomena

659
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,833
which seem to be increasing
by the hour.

660
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:21,467
This weather phenomena
has now reached critical mass

661
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:25,133
as you can see,
it's now become a massive vortex!

662
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:30,038
I've just received breaking news
that the military units

663
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:33,514
have now been moved into the city
to assist with evacuation.

664
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:34,379
Now reports say

665
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:37,180
that a lightening storm
has tripled in size

666
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:39,413
over the last 24 hours,

667
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:43,148
and that the giant vortex
is now engulfing the city.

668
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,785
But as the vortex drifts
farther across Europe,

669
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,227
I think the question
on everybody's lips is

670
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:49,660
where do we evacuate to?

671
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,620
What is this?

672
00:45:24,623 --> 00:45:27,866
If I'm right,
it's the beginning of the end.

673
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,261
Don't take this the wrong way,

674
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,001
but I hope to God you're wrong.

675
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,353
Mr. Hadden, we have no choice.

676
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:46,713
We have to contain
the lab and destroy the skulls.

677
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,552
That is impossible, Colonel.

678
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:51,018
We can't just sit here and do nothing!

679
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:53,484
Daddy!

680
00:45:54,486 --> 00:45:56,056
I thought I had lost you!

681
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,035
Professor John Winston,

682
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:02,699
I'd like you to meet William Hadden.

683
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:03,499
My father.

684
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:04,728
Mr. Hadden.

685
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,639
Professor, I was a great
admirer of your father's,

686
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,874
as I am of you yourself.

687
00:46:09,968 --> 00:46:11,709
This is Colonel Bailey.

688
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,475
Bailey.

689
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:13,376
Professor.

690
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:14,482
I appreciate the kind words,

691
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,347
I don't meet many fans of my father's

692
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:18,521
except for fringe groups and lunatics.

693
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,712
Well, I hope I'm neither.

694
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:23,353
Before I lost my ability to walk,

695
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:25,552
it was where I did my best thinking.

696
00:46:25,817 --> 00:46:28,354
So, if you don't mind,
shall we walk together?

697
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:30,829
I don't mind at all,
if you don't mind explaining to me

698
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,960
what exactly it is that I'm doing here.

699
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:37,803
I'm a very wealthy man,
Doctor Winston.

700
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,864
I have been for most of my life.

701
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:44,139
But, I fear my hubris has
gotten the better of me

702
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:46,306
in the light of what is now happening.

703
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:49,519
I'll put this as simply as I can.

704
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:56,490
You're here, Doctor Winston,
because I am dying.

705
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:12,235
I have been fighting cancer for ten years.

706
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:14,540
In my pursuit of a cure,

707
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,078
I became aware of the crystal skulls

708
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:18,871
and began to acquire them.

709
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,108
All of them but the thirteenth.

710
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,206
Yes.

711
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,286
The first were found in South America,

712
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:25,342
followed by three others-

713
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,478
Forgive me for interrupting, sir,

714
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:27,578
I understand the history

715
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,749
but all the skulls have
proven to be a fraud,

716
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,925
carbon dating has tested
them to be no older

717
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,757
than 200 or 300 years.

718
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,956
Trust me, we have had our failures.

719
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:37,593
No one's perfect.

720
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:41,565
Let's just say the tests were
somewhat suspect.

721
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:42,626
Suspect?

722
00:47:43,595 --> 00:47:44,630
What are you saying?

723
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:47,470
The carbon dating was altered somehow?

724
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,965
You got the twelve different skulls

725
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,444
from all different pans of the world?

726
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:52,444
Hadden Industries owns

727
00:47:52,504 --> 00:47:54,677
six of the largest
carbon dating facilities.

728
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,749
So the tests were fake?

729
00:47:57,342 --> 00:48:00,516
Let's just say we have a higher
standard of proof.

730
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,347
Ah, right, right.

731
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,552
You duped the whole
scientific community.

732
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,459
What we did was soften
the purchase price

733
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:08,359
to take them off the museum displays.

734
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:09,621
Mr. Hadden may be a billionaire,

735
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:11,324
but everyone has their price.

736
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:11,628
Right, right.

737
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:12,494
So it's about money.

738
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,601
We're talking about putting together

739
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:17,765
twelve of the most
precious objects in the world.

740
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:20,473
Something that would not
happen if the truth

741
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:21,565
became common knowledge.

742
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,603
Mr. Hadden, I don't know
what the implications are

743
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,009
of you altering these tests,

744
00:48:25,136 --> 00:48:27,241
but I imagine it involves prison.

745
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,043
I am dying, Colonel.

746
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:30,278
Yeah, well, you're not dead yet.

747
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:32,218
Ok, hold on, hold on, hold on.

748
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,615
None of this really matters now.

749
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,559
The skulls are real.

750
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,591
So how old are they?

751
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,460
Most of them were dated
about 500,000 years ago.

752
00:48:43,555 --> 00:48:45,466
Others cannot be dated.

753
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:46,900
500,000 years?

754
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:48,368
That pre-dates man.

755
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:51,266
Which implies some other origin.

756
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,136
Perhaps extraterrestrials?

757
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:57,303
Mr. Hadden, I don't know if your
carbon dating shenanigans

758
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:58,506
have lead to this disaster,

759
00:48:58,636 --> 00:48:59,979
but I do know that
I have another problem.

760
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,412
Preventing the end of the world.

761
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:04,248
You and I have the same goal,
Colonel.

762
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:05,979
Colonel!

763
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,111
Enough!

764
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:10,955
Now if you and Professor Winston
can come up with a solution,

765
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,150
I'm all ears.

766
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,728
But now I must confer with NATO

767
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:14,819
and come up with our own method.

768
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:16,522
Brute force will not work!

769
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:19,491
You saw what happened
when your men attempted

770
00:49:19,591 --> 00:49:20,797
to attack the skulls!

771
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:23,699
They have an impregnable
field around them!

772
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,364
That was four men.

773
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:27,736
I'm talking about some
stronger medicine.

774
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:30,603
We know force won't work.

775
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:32,035
What Will?

776
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,474
The thirteenth skull.

777
00:49:34,105 --> 00:49:35,379
But the dilemma is

778
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:38,452
I have no idea
where to begin to look for it.

779
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,956
I want you to follow
your father's footsteps

780
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:42,113
and find it.

781
00:49:42,814 --> 00:49:44,157
Fulfill your destiny.

782
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,157
Mr. Hadden-

783
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:47,753
Every single one of my resources

784
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,363
will be at your disposal.

785
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,398
God knows I created this disaster.

786
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,537
If I have to use
every bit of my fortune to stop it,

787
00:49:55,627 --> 00:49:56,628
so be it.

788
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:02,543
There's one thing
that neither one of us has much of.

789
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,304
And what would that be?

790
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:06,741
Time.

791
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:19,189
So am I to assume this chopper
is safer than the last one?

792
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,553
It's Cold War technology.

793
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,598
It's built to withstand
a nuclear explosion.

794
00:50:27,792 --> 00:50:30,295
So why didn't you tell me
that Hadden was your father?

795
00:50:30,395 --> 00:50:31,965
And spoil the surprise?

796
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:37,904
You know,
we have a lot in common, Professor.

797
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:38,969
Really?

798
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,370
What's that?

799
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,878
We've both spent our lives
trying to get out of the shadow

800
00:50:44,008 --> 00:50:45,078
of our fathers.

801
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,955
Is that what Mallory is?

802
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:53,618
It was my mother's maiden name.

803
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,225
She died when I was a little girl.

804
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:01,231
Would it have made a difference
if you had known who I was?

805
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:05,031
In what, how seriously I took you?

806
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,840
Or how attractive I thought
you were when we first met?

807
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:12,369
Seriously?

808
00:51:15,139 --> 00:51:16,914
So, do you uh...

809
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:20,386
always wait until you get a girl
alone in a helicopter

810
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,515
before you bust a line like that out?

811
00:51:24,215 --> 00:51:26,718
No, I usually wait to find out
if the girl I'm hitting on

812
00:51:26,851 --> 00:51:28,558
is the daughter of the billionaire.

813
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:29,858
Oh, sure.

814
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:33,295
Well then I guess it's a shame

815
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,299
that my inheritance is
being held in a living trust.

816
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:38,829
Ahh.

817
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,104
So where are we going?

818
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:49,284
Your father told me to follow
in my father's footsteps.

819
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:53,519
That is what I'm doing.

820
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,482
The thirteenth skull is down there?

821
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,551
No, this is the last place my father came

822
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,279
before he disappeared.

823
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:26,146
And this is the only way down?

824
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:30,484
I'm afraid so.

825
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:43,393
Ready?

826
00:53:10,622 --> 00:53:11,657
We're here.

827
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,660
Easy, easy.

828
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,260
I've got ya.

829
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,541
That's interesting.

830
00:53:31,142 --> 00:53:32,142
What?

831
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,581
Since I was here with Terry,

832
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:38,086
I find that this cave has collapsed.

833
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:40,483
That's good?

834
00:53:40,818 --> 00:53:42,456
Not if we need another way out.

835
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,866
Or we could have avoided
this entire extreme sports routine.

836
00:53:48,492 --> 00:53:50,699
Yeah, fat chance.
Come on.

837
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:31,645
How did you get your father's notebook

838
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,513
if they never found his body?

839
00:54:34,138 --> 00:54:36,641
It was sent to me at a college
where I was teaching

840
00:54:37,542 --> 00:54:39,419
before your father had me fired.

841
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:46,586
Ok, well that doesn't explain
who sent it to you.

842
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,788
You don't know?

843
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:55,269
It was your father.

844
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:57,702
He sent a note along with it.

845
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,469
He said that one of his
researchers had found it

846
00:55:00,565 --> 00:55:03,876
on an expedition and
he thought perhaps one day

847
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:05,411
I would find it useful.

848
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:09,583
So this was the last place
your father was?

849
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:11,749
This is where they found the notebook?

850
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,119
I'd be inclined to agree with you.

851
00:55:15,113 --> 00:55:17,753
But if my father's research
team had already been here

852
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,757
and they didn't find
the thirteenth skull,

853
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,227
why are we here?

854
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,327
Hold this, please.

855
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,795
This is the last place
that my father came.

856
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,632
Where my brother lost his life.

857
00:55:31,262 --> 00:55:33,435
And I'm betting that
the answer is still here.

858
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:35,544
We just have to know
where to look for it.

859
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:50,123
Excuse me, gentlemen.

860
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,550
What is it?

861
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:57,394
The skulls are generating a very
focused magnetic field

862
00:55:57,488 --> 00:56:00,469
which begins in the isolation chamber

863
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:02,902
and extends out beyond the common line.

864
00:56:02,993 --> 00:56:06,236
That's the line that separates
the Earth's atmosphere

865
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,430
from outer space.

866
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:08,467
I know what it is.

867
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:13,539
It seems that it now
extends back to the Earth's core.

868
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:15,741
What the hell does all that mean,
Mr. Hadden?

869
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,285
It means that there's now a new field

870
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,615
competing with the existing one.

871
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:28,586
Alright,
so now give me the bad news.

872
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,660
Volcanic and seismic activity,

873
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:36,500
and a good possibility
that the Earth's iron crust

874
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:39,040
will crack like an egg,

875
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:46,744
and if that happens the planet
will be literally torn apart

876
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,641
And the good news?

877
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:53,582
Mr. Pritchard.

878
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:57,220
At the current rate, sir, roughly 30 hours.

879
00:56:57,615 --> 00:57:00,357
- Issue an evacuation order.
- Yes, sir.

880
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:02,525
In 30 hours,

881
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:04,189
I am authorizing the use of a tactical

882
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,394
nuclear weapon at this site.

883
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,297
I'll vaporize those god forsaken things

884
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,030
back to wherever it is that they came from.

885
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:12,233
You saw what happened
when your men attempted

886
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:13,067
to destroy them!

887
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,608
That was four soldiers, Mr. Hadden.

888
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,439
I'm talking about power that
hasn't been unleashed

889
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:19,844
since Hiroshima.

890
00:57:19,971 --> 00:57:23,919
You are going to be the man
who ended the world.

891
00:57:24,709 --> 00:57:26,086
Or maybe saved it.

892
00:57:42,993 --> 00:57:43,994
You alright?

893
00:57:44,195 --> 00:57:44,696
Mmmhmm.

894
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,335
This way.

895
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,420
Good job.

896
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,898
- You ok?
- Yeah.

897
00:59:00,137 --> 00:59:01,377
John?

898
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:03,641
Look.

899
00:59:45,516 --> 00:59:46,756
John, you ok?

900
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:48,952
Yeah.

901
00:59:50,654 --> 00:59:51,724
Yeah, I'm fine.

902
00:59:55,526 --> 00:59:57,096
This is for you, my brother.

903
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:12,545
We're ready for the extraction.

904
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,554
Go ahead

905
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,129
Come on!

906
01:00:41,205 --> 01:00:42,377
We've gotta get out of this place!

907
01:00:42,473 --> 01:00:43,076
Yeah, no kidding.

908
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,307
Come on.

909
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:53,619
I'm glad that's behind us.

910
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,801
We don't need these anymore.

911
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:01,991
Ok.

912
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:06,474
Here, let me help you.

913
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:13,947
Alright, this way.

914
01:01:16,073 --> 01:01:17,518
Let's go, come on.

915
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,822
What happened to the helicopter?

916
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:20,948
Someone shot it down.

917
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:21,523
Who?

918
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:22,782
I don't know.

919
01:01:23,614 --> 01:01:26,026
Probably the same person
who shot at me in the bar.

920
01:01:26,383 --> 01:01:28,420
They stepped it up a notch or two.

921
01:01:33,657 --> 01:01:34,657
Careful.

922
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:51,507
Agh!

923
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,351
VVhafre you doing? That really hurt!

924
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:55,553
Mitchell,
what the hell are you doing here?

925
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:56,818
Oh now come on.

926
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:57,948
You didn't really think Mr. Hadden

927
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:00,017
was going to let you traipse
halfway across Europe

928
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:01,244
with his precious little girl

929
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,456
with nobody to keep an eye on you, did you?

930
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,056
What happened to the helicopter?

931
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,202
Someone took it down with a missile.

932
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,564
Someone who seems to be
intent on killing me.

933
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:10,696
Do you have any idea who?

934
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:12,501
Religious fanatics, fringe groups,

935
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:15,269
- white supremacists, CIA...
- Alright, alright.

936
01:02:15,366 --> 01:02:17,209
You know,
all I know is that before I met you

937
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:19,780
I had no idea
that anyone would want to kill me.

938
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:21,315
I'm a likable enough kind of guy.

939
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:22,712
So you say. Now look,

940
01:02:23,007 --> 01:02:24,247
do you want to stand around here
and talk about

941
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:25,688
the assassins who are after you,

942
01:02:25,709 --> 01:02:27,017
or do you want to get the hell out of here

943
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,385
before they work out that you
weren't in the chopper

944
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:29,545
that they shot down?

945
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,482
Yeah, that's what I thought.

946
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,313
I want an EMP-shielded
chopper standing by

947
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,535
to pull the rest of us out
of here when the time comes.

948
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:01,112
Yes, sir.

949
01:03:01,211 --> 01:03:02,417
They'll be here.

950
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:03,546
I hope you're right.

951
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:05,322
For everyone's sake.

952
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:07,262
Because I don't want to go down in history

953
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:09,193
as the man who authorized
the detonation of a nuclear device

954
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:10,559
to save the world.

955
01:03:10,688 --> 01:03:13,862
Then don't do it, Colonel.

956
01:03:14,591 --> 01:03:15,899
It's out of my hands.

957
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:30,513
We should put these lights out
and kill that heater.

958
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:31,881
It could attract the wrong kind of company,

959
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:32,783
if you know what I mean.

960
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:35,015
Yeah, well I'm cold,
and we need light to figure this out.

961
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,216
Well, then you might
as well send up a signal flare

962
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:39,520
and tell whoever is after us where we are.

963
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:42,220
Maybe you should put out that
cheap cigar you're smoking.

964
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,730
The smell will attract
the wrong kind of people.

965
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:46,165
It's a Cohiba.

966
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:47,701
Oh, well perfect.

967
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:49,368
In that case we'll only attract

968
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,497
<i>the best kind of terrorists and assassins.</i>

969
01:03:52,096 --> 01:03:53,939
Besides, that's why we have you here.

970
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:54,735
To protect us.

971
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:57,607
Yeah, well I can't
protect you from yourselves.

972
01:03:58,502 --> 01:03:59,502
It's not here.

973
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:00,538
It has to be.

974
01:04:00,671 --> 01:04:02,582
Yeah, well I can't see it and I'm tired.

975
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:13,522
Maybe we should grab
a couple of hours of sleep.

976
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:14,789
Start fresh.

977
01:04:14,885 --> 01:04:16,523
The sun will be up soon.

978
01:04:17,488 --> 01:04:19,968
Although, if we don't crack this
it won't matter.

979
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,764
How are we gonna get out of here
without a chopper, Mitchell?

980
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:25,908
I'm not putting another bird up in the area

981
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,475
until we've secured it.

982
01:04:27,731 --> 01:04:28,505
Now listen, professor.

983
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:30,610
You need to concentrate
on saving the world.

984
01:04:32,269 --> 01:04:34,909
I need to get some fresh air so
I can think.

985
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:40,386
Go and give him a hand.

986
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:53,422
You see it?

987
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,491
See what?

988
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,066
There.

989
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,500
There it is!

990
01:05:00,864 --> 01:05:02,502
I knew I would find it.

991
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,641
Let me show you where it is.

992
01:05:08,072 --> 01:05:09,551
Have you two figured it out?

993
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:10,414
Yeah, maybe.

994
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,714
I need to report to
Mr. Hadden and the Colonel

995
01:05:12,776 --> 01:05:14,551
if you've cracked this or not.

996
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:21,023
This is not the map, this is the place.

997
01:05:21,785 --> 01:05:24,527
These, these are the map.

998
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,726
I'm not following you.

999
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:27,262
They're stars.

1000
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:30,236
This drawing shows
us exactly where to find

1001
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:31,600
the thirteenth skull.

1002
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,714
I thought you'd be excited.

1003
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,515
Well, the temple in that cave
must be 3000 years old.

1004
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:44,675
I'd say more like five.

1005
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,048
Oh, even better.

1006
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:47,383
So all we have to do is figure out

1007
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,479
where that constellation appeared

1008
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:50,488
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1009
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:51,614
Well, that's easy.

1010
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,015
You know,
I realize that in order for the two of us

1011
01:05:54,051 --> 01:05:56,964
to figure it out it would take months,
maybe longer.

1012
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,727
But for one of your dad's super computers

1013
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:01,493
it should be a piece of cake.

1014
01:06:01,658 --> 01:06:02,658
Right.

1015
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:14,449
Alright,

1016
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:21,145
enter the declination
and extrapolate.

1017
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:34,896
Oh wait, we've got something.

1018
01:06:35,092 --> 01:06:36,662
You two are a piece of work.

1019
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,005
Right, you wanted to know
where that constellation appeared

1020
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:42,337
in the night sky 5000 years ago?

1021
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:48,316
Well, actually 5302 months
and 11 days.

1022
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:49,983
There's your answer.

1023
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:51,846
What the hell is that?

1024
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,353
It's the Visoko Valley,
it's theoretically a pyramid.

1025
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:55,614
That's where we're going.

1026
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,334
It's interesting how
it has remained unexplored

1027
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:18,604
for thousands of years.

1028
01:07:18,836 --> 01:07:22,113
People thought it
was a natural formation for a long time.

1029
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,425
Oh, my father said
the military put a clock on us.

1030
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:31,914
We have six hours.

1031
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:34,519
I hope Mitchell gets
back before the world ends

1032
01:07:34,585 --> 01:07:36,531
and he's out trying to rent a car.

1033
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:40,389
Really?

1034
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,499
That's an interesting choice.

1035
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:48,641
That's our man, that's our man!

1036
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:49,699
Oh boy.

1037
01:07:51,868 --> 01:07:54,712
You work for the wealthiest
man in the world

1038
01:07:54,805 --> 01:07:58,116
and the best car you could rent was this?

1039
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:02,080
Well, excuse me, Mr. Trump,
but they didn't take credit cards

1040
01:08:02,212 --> 01:08:04,283
and this was all
I could get with the cash I had.

1041
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:07,996
Well, so where are we going?

1042
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:10,219
Is that it?

1043
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,402
What were you expecting,
Mitchell? Giza?

1044
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,605
Well, I don't know,
maybe something bigger than that?

1045
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,663
It just looks like an odd-shaped hill.

1046
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:21,274
Well, it is a pyramid.

1047
01:08:21,665 --> 01:08:23,906
Yeah, well I know that,
Professor Smarty-Pants.

1048
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,345
All I'm saying is
it doesn't look like a place

1049
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:28,183
that would hold the key to save the world.

1050
01:08:28,538 --> 01:08:28,913
I see.

1051
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,952
And what do you suppose
that would look like?

1052
01:08:31,341 --> 01:08:33,321
Ok, alright, so what's the plan?

1053
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,884
We're gonna keep a low profile,

1054
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:37,015
stay away from
the village until it gets dark,

1055
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:39,551
and then go in nice and quiet.

1056
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:44,532
That plan sounds as strong
as the choice in cars.

1057
01:08:44,655 --> 01:08:45,656
Get in the car.

1058
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,941
My goodness, could this be smaller?

1059
01:08:56,566 --> 01:08:57,704
Where is everyone?

1060
01:08:57,968 --> 01:08:59,038
How should I know?

1061
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:01,310
A town meeting, strip club?

1062
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:03,040
Strip club?

1063
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:05,245
These are nice people.

1064
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:06,976
You never know.

1065
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,491
Villages all need a good strip club.

1066
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:11,291
A little early, wouldn't you say?

1067
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:26,938
Well, I guess we know where everyone is.

1068
01:09:27,064 --> 01:09:27,508
We've got to get out.

1069
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:29,802
- This will pass, give it time.
- Look behind you.

1070
01:09:32,536 --> 01:09:33,207
Oh, shoot.

1071
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:34,303
Get out.

1072
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,215
Just act normal.

1073
01:09:48,552 --> 01:09:49,656
Don't look around.

1074
01:09:50,287 --> 01:09:50,662
Don't react.

1075
01:09:50,821 --> 01:09:52,801
Don't make it known we're being followed.

1076
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,624
But we are being followed,
so how are we supposed to act?

1077
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:56,625
Casual.

1078
01:09:56,793 --> 01:09:57,430
How many are there?

1079
01:09:57,594 --> 01:10:00,302
There's two behind us
and two in front of us.

1080
01:10:03,166 --> 01:10:05,203
Just turn around and mingle.

1081
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:07,036
<i>QKZV -</i>

1082
01:10:13,176 --> 01:10:14,382
What are they doing?

1083
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,023
I've seen you before.

1084
01:10:56,553 --> 01:10:57,553
Yes.

1085
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:00,098
And I have seen you, as well.

1086
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:04,565
Now, I'm afraid this
will be our last meeting.

1087
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:08,403
Is that some kind of euphemism
because you're going to kill us?

1088
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:09,532
Easy, Sienna.

1089
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:10,839
Don't antagonize the man.

1090
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:12,410
He's got a sword.

1091
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,539
Yeah, the professor has a point.

1092
01:11:14,705 --> 01:11:20,883
Go on, enjoy your banter,
because it will all end now.

1093
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:26,360
What is it that you're after?

1094
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:29,187
You know what we're after.

1095
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,188
You've been following us.

1096
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:32,726
Yes.

1097
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:35,599
It is ourjob to protect the thirteen.

1098
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:37,226
Skulls.

1099
01:11:38,662 --> 01:11:41,700
They possess incredible power
when they are brought together.

1100
01:11:42,566 --> 01:11:44,011
Something your father did.

1101
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,945
Before you die, I wanted to ask you

1102
01:11:51,108 --> 01:11:54,282
what it is you thought would happen
once you found that

1103
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:55,581
which you seek?

1104
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:58,757
We need to work together
in order to stop it.

1105
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,156
Stop what?

1106
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:03,886
Don't you know?

1107
01:12:06,590 --> 01:12:08,627
The destruction caused
by the twelve skulls

1108
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:09,825
being brought together.

1109
01:12:09,926 --> 01:12:11,803
We need the thifleenth to stop it.

1110
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:15,308
Well, if a man was foolish
enough to trifle

1111
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,536
with this power,

1112
01:12:16,633 --> 01:12:20,046
then it is he who has brought upon
himself this destruction.

1113
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:21,548
You cannot save them.

1114
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:23,772
Now prepare.

1115
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:26,175
John!

1116
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:27,882
Don't worry, look away.

1117
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:29,753
It'll only take a second.

1118
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:32,715
Stop!

1119
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:36,393
Give me the sword.

1120
01:12:51,335 --> 01:12:52,507
Hello, junior.

1121
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:57,541
Dad?

1122
01:12:58,608 --> 01:12:59,678
We buried you.

1123
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:02,512
We thought you were dead somewhere.

1124
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:03,612
I'm sorry, son.

1125
01:13:04,814 --> 01:13:07,420
We looked for you for so long, Dad.

1126
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:09,961
And then I found your journal.

1127
01:13:10,087 --> 01:13:12,192
I left it in a place
I knew it would be discovered.

1128
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:15,029
I had hoped if you found it,
it would give you some answers.

1129
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:17,594
It gave me answers,
but far more questions.

1130
01:13:18,395 --> 01:13:20,432
It's basically what got me here.

1131
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:21,530
What happened, Dad?

1132
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,441
Where did you go?

1133
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,671
I know you have a lot of questions,

1134
01:13:23,767 --> 01:13:25,246
and you should.

1135
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:29,776
I've been after the thirteenth
skull for so many years,

1136
01:13:30,674 --> 01:13:32,551
I had come so close,

1137
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:36,516
and then I found this place
and the brotherhood.

1138
01:13:37,047 --> 01:13:39,357
This is the brotherhood's last stronghold.

1139
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:41,357
It holds the last of our secrets.

1140
01:13:42,552 --> 01:13:43,656
What secrets?

1141
01:13:44,588 --> 01:13:46,397
I found the skull, John.

1142
01:13:46,556 --> 01:13:49,435
It's real, just like
I always knew it would be!

1143
01:13:50,093 --> 01:13:51,197
They gave me a choice.

1144
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:52,636
I could die,

1145
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:53,929
or I could join with them

1146
01:13:54,064 --> 01:13:56,203
in protecting the secrets of the skulls.

1147
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:02,377
I had been searching so long,
nothing else mattered.

1148
01:14:03,473 --> 01:14:05,384
Obviously your family didn't matter.

1149
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:09,583
Your choice lead to your son's death.

1150
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:13,560
Terry died
wanting to follow in your footsteps.

1151
01:14:17,854 --> 01:14:21,392
I loved you and your brother
more than you will ever know,

1152
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,564
but this was something I couldn't refuse.

1153
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:28,102
After everything I had seen,
everything I had learned.

1154
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:32,640
It wasn't a choice,
it was my destiny.

1155
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:37,309
Maybe your destiny
could be put to good use.

1156
01:14:37,607 --> 01:14:40,520
The world is the thirteenth skull,
Dad.

1157
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:42,555
You know they will
never let you have it.

1158
01:14:42,712 --> 01:14:45,022
Don't let Terry's death be in vain!

1159
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:51,125
Without the skull, billions will die.

1160
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:55,259
If the skulls have been gathered,

1161
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,366
and the end of the world has begun,
so be it.

1162
01:14:58,595 --> 01:14:59,903
This is man's destiny.

1163
01:15:00,063 --> 01:15:02,134
Man's destiny rides on your shoulders.

1164
01:15:04,301 --> 01:15:07,680
You understand that they cannot
ever leave this place now.

1165
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:08,943
Yes, I know.

1166
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:12,885
I only ask that
I do not have to watch.

1167
01:15:13,376 --> 01:15:15,481
Yeah, we wouldn't want
you to be upset

1168
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:18,420
watching your last
son be killed for your destiny!

1169
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,854
You're going to kill us here,
in the pyramid?

1170
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:23,123
Do you have no honour?

1171
01:15:23,286 --> 01:15:25,323
Woman, do not speak
to me like this!

1172
01:15:25,588 --> 01:15:28,694
I have spent my life
defending the honour of this place.

1173
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:31,395
There is never honour for those who kill,
Hussein!

1174
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:39,111
I'm sorry, old friend.

1175
01:15:43,874 --> 01:15:45,182
Follow me, this way!

1176
01:16:07,364 --> 01:16:09,469
No, sir, the squadron is in
the air awaiting orders.

1177
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:15,247
The magnetic field is at 95 percent, sir.

1178
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:17,899
It's time we get everybody out of here.

1179
01:16:18,174 --> 01:16:22,714
Colonel, your bombs aren't going to do
what you think they will.

1180
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:24,948
Just give them more time.

1181
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:30,465
I'll give them as much time as I can.

1182
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:34,028
After that, I'm under orders.

1183
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:34,961
Thank you.

1184
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,037
Thank me if we all live that long.

1185
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:30,632
We've gotta get out of here.

1186
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,621
Mitchell, call my father.

1187
01:17:35,285 --> 01:17:36,652
Dad, what are you doing?

1188
01:17:36,653 --> 01:17:38,462
This place is my life, John.

1189
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,498
I have nowhere to go.

1190
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:42,599
Let me die here.

1191
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:46,574
I don't deserve to live after
what I did to the brotherhood.

1192
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,839
Whafre you talking about?!

1193
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,344
You have a different life now,

1194
01:17:51,468 --> 01:17:52,879
you've got a granddaughter!

1195
01:17:53,102 --> 01:17:53,876
I have a granddaughter?

1196
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:56,348
Yes! Terry's daughter!
She's going to be seven!

1197
01:17:57,307 --> 01:17:58,307
(" Really')
<i>'</i> Yes!

1198
01:18:02,946 --> 01:18:03,946
Dad!

1199
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:09,459
I'm sorry, son.

1200
01:18:10,586 --> 01:18:11,586
Dad, no!

1201
01:18:13,790 --> 01:18:15,599
Come on, we have to go.

1202
01:18:15,692 --> 01:18:17,171
John, come on! Now!

1203
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:18,864
- Dad!
- Come on, John, now!

1204
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:52,705
Sir, the magnetic fields
are at 100 percent.

1205
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,076
I'm afraid your people are out of time,
Mr. Hadden.

1206
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,107
Alpha Squadron, time to target?

1207
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:03,538
Copy that.

1208
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:05,407
Eight minutes.

1209
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,512
We've got to get everyone out
at a safe minimum distance

1210
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,484
before detonation.

1211
01:19:08,578 --> 01:19:11,616
You heard them, they're on their way!

1212
01:19:12,649 --> 01:19:14,609
I've given them as much time as I can,
Mr. Hadden.

1213
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:16,163
We can't wait any longer.

1214
01:19:16,653 --> 01:19:18,257
- We're finished here.
- Yes, sir.

1215
01:19:18,488 --> 01:19:19,488
Daddy!

1216
01:19:19,822 --> 01:19:20,862
I told you they'd make it.

1217
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:21,766
I'm not re-calling the bombs

1218
01:19:21,891 --> 01:19:23,461
until I'm certain this thing works.

1219
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:27,875
Let's do this before it's too late.

1220
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:42,690
The suit should protect
you from the light.

1221
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:46,217
It limits your exposure to any
ionizing radiation,

1222
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:48,623
but I can't make any promises.

1223
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,227
I don't actually know what's happening,

1224
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:31,763
but it seems that the vortex is dissipating

1225
01:21:31,955 --> 01:21:33,957
and the storm seems to be coming to an end!

1226
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:46,268
John.

1227
01:21:53,543 --> 01:21:54,544
Oh, thanks.

1228
01:21:58,848 --> 01:22:00,521
I think we need to get a drink.

1229
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:06,055
And when I say we I mean me.

1230
01:22:06,756 --> 01:22:08,463
It's your round, professor.

1231
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,060
Are you ok, sir?

1232
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:14,197
Call my doctor.

1233
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:15,297
Right away, sir.

1234
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:16,535
- Colonel.
- Yes?

1235
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:19,646
If you could possibly help me
with something...

1236
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:21,638
lfl can.

1237
01:23:57,633 --> 01:24:00,512
Key Nine to Base, we're ready.

1238
01:24:02,171 --> 01:24:04,573
Alright, seal the chamber.

1239
01:24:04,574 --> 01:24:05,575
Copy that.

1240
01:24:18,788 --> 01:24:19,788
It's over.

1241
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:24,393
What now?

1242
01:24:27,763 --> 01:24:28,763
One second.

1243
01:24:34,804 --> 01:24:36,340
Her father is dead.

1244
01:24:45,348 --> 01:24:46,918
Sienna, I'm so sorry.

1245
01:24:49,018 --> 01:24:52,124
It's ok,
I guess I knew it was coming

1246
01:24:52,221 --> 01:24:55,202
I just didn't know when.

1247
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:57,226
I understand.

1248
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:02,806
I guess you do,

1249
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:06,208
more than anyone else.

1250
01:25:29,892 --> 01:25:32,236
CMV has just learned
that mysterious billionaire

1251
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:34,339
William Hadden has died.

1252
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,667
It is not known exactly when
Mr. Hadden passed,

1253
01:25:36,732 --> 01:25:39,212
but his representatives say
that it was some time last week.

1254
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:41,846
Not since Howard Hughes
has there been so much mystery

1255
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:43,707
surrounding the death of a billionaire.

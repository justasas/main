1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,300
Just hear me out!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,610
Listen to me for once, will you?

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,770
Let me explain why I'm doing this.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,540
Something horrible is going on!

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,580
Be quiet!

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,650
Ouch...

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,700
Come on...

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,630
Guk-Hee, are you okay?

9
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,530
Who is he?

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,520
You and your friends...

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,680
...always get stuck with scoundrels
like him whenever you go.

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,790
I got a phone call to come
in for the missing girl.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,540
Honey, are you okay?

14
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,550
Honey?

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,380
You have a husband?

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,470
Who are you?

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,450
Oh...

18
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,500
I'm Guk-Hee's friend.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,390
Friend?

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
What the heck?

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,310
Whose friend? Since when?

22
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,480
Honey, he's not a friend.

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,750
I don't have friends.

24
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,570
I met him at the beach,
but there's nothing between us.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,550
You don't know anything!
Why did you punch him?

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,340
Tell him that you're sorry!

27
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,660
You were so rude to her.

28
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,330
I never would've guessed
that you're her husband.

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,300
What? Why, I ought to...

30
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,530
Guk-Hee! They want you inside!

31
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,490
Honey, are you okay?

32
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,490
Let me help you get up.

33
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,420
Don't get mad, Honey.

34
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,510
Stay calm, will you?

35
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,630
Apologize! Tell him that you're sorry.

36
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,500
I'm sorry!

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,670
Do it sincerely!

38
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,470
Forget it!

39
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,320
If I ever see you again,
you're going to get it!

40
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,570
Got that?

41
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,690
You tiny little prick!

42
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:44,750
Let go!

43
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,710
Honey! Honey...

44
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,770
Honey...

45
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,330
Guk-Hee! Come inside...

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,300
- Episode 3 -
Why didn't you call earlier?

47
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,590
The officers and the neighbors
were all worried about you.

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,470
Someone even accused me.

49
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,400
Anyways, I'm glad you're safe.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
I love you.

51
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
It's my wife.

52
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,660
- Lee Yun-Shil?
- Yes.

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,420
I'm calling from the police station.

54
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,450
I have a few questions to ask
about your missing case.

55
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,390
You're Lee Yun-Shil, right?

56
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,340
Can I get your resident
ID number and your address?

57
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:54,460
Good, thank you.

58
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,410
Bye. Thank you for your cooperation.

59
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,590
I've always been an honest man.

60
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,780
Don't treat me like a criminal.

61
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:12,370
I'll go home and think hard about how you should be reprimanded for this.

62
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,770
Bye.

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,630
Honey, it's me.

64
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,600
Are you home?

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,570
Hello? Hello? Hello?

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,790
You're not in college, right?

67
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,510
Why did you lie to me?

68
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,610
Huh? I'm sorry,
but I have to go home.

69
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,310
Hey! Gyung Guk-Hee!

70
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,520
I'm sorry I did that.

71
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,690
Still, you shouldn't have punched
him without checking who he is.

72
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,310
I'm really sorry for lying, though.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
Honey!

74
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,610
Get out!

75
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,300
Get out!

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,660
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,310
Get out! Now!

78
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,520
Honey! Honey!

79
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,660
Open the door.

80
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,480
This isn't right.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,420
Eun-Suk! Ki-Suk!

82
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,310
Honey! Honey!

83
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,370
Honey! You only need milk
from the store, right?

84
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay.

85
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,570
Honey! I'm sorry!

86
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,400
Eun-Suk! Ki-Suk!
Can you hear me?

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,760
Ki-Suk! Eun-Suk!

88
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,310
Don't open the door
without my permission.

89
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,460
Go to your room.

90
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,390
Honey! This isn't right!

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,540
Honey, please open the door.

92
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,400
Why, I ought to...

93
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,740
Why, I ought to...

94
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,380
I'm Myung-Hoon.

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,400
Is Eun-Suk home?

96
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,580
Hey! It's Myung-Hoon!

97
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,660
Is he your friend?

98
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,570
I'm here to return Eun-Suk's book!

99
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,480
He brought your book.

100
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,480
Hold on.

101
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,690
Mom!

102
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,310
I helped you because you helped me
get my cat out of the gutter.

103
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,550
Don't ask me for favors
like this anymore!

104
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,440
I won't. Thanks, Myung-Hoon.

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,700
Goodnight, Eun-Suk.

106
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,650
Bye.

107
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,420
Bye.

108
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,600
I know that you're angry, but you shouldn't kick me out like this.

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,640
Where do you expect me
to go this late at night?

110
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,700
You're going too far.

111
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,350
The four of us went to the beach,
but one disappeared.

112
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,560
It was crazy, and I couldn't
even tell you about it.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,730
I was scared to death.

114
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,770
Anyways, we got in touch with her.

115
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,310
She's okay.

116
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,770
It's all over now.

117
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,540
I think that man's so weird.

118
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,310
I can't believe he punched you.

119
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,510
Since you're the better man,
just let him go.

120
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,550
I'll tell him off, although I doubt
I'll ever see him again.

121
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,550
Are you okay?

122
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,390
Stop it!

123
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,370
What are we going to do?

124
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,500
Stop it!

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,640
Leave me alone!

126
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,400
Honey! Kids!

127
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,540
Wake up! Let's eat.

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,360
Honey...I'll pick out your tie.

129
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,770
You look great!

130
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,500
Do you want that instead?

131
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,690
Well, you look good in anything.

132
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,310
People will think you're
Eun-Suk's uncle...

133
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,680
...if you wear that for Eun-Suk's camp.

134
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,670
Honey, I know I picked this out,
but doesn't it look really good?

135
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,570
You can't tell that it's fake!

136
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,730
This knockoff looks like the real thing.

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,720
Let's have breakfast.

138
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,480
I made your favorite seaweed soup
and stir-fried potatoes.

139
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Seaweed soup and stir-fried potatoes?

140
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,720
Do you think you can be
a good wife by good cooking?

141
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,630
I'm worn out and don't have
anything to look forward to in life.

142
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:56,770
I'm about to go postal because I can never get any rest from work or home!

143
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,620
I don't need stir-fried potatoes.

144
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,490
Just don't drive me crazy!

145
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,370
Who knows what I'll do
if you stoop any lower?

146
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,680
Understand?

147
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,710
Su-Duk!

148
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,650
You dodged!

149
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,310
Su-Duk will get a time-out.

150
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,600
I'll sit here for my time-out.

151
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,610
I'll never go to the police
station again, I promise!

152
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,480
What a shame!

153
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,590
Not only those women
didn't come home for the night...

154
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,440
...they had to go to the police station.

155
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,420
The other people will think
we're just like them.

156
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,530
I wonder why the tenants
won't stop making trouble.

157
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,530
Yes, but our biggest problem
is the divorcee!

158
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,680
I'll tell the homeowners not to give
rent to families with problems.

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,760
Good idea!

160
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:07,330
They'll ruin our neighborhood!

161
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,650
Keep an eye on your husband.

162
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,400
Make sure he doesn't
get bitten by a crazy dog.

163
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,450
Eun-Suk!

164
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,370
What happened to your face?

165
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,580
Did you fight with your friend?

166
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:33,510
Myung-Hoon's mom said that I can't
run for class president because of you!

167
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,790
Because of me?

168
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,640
Because you went to the police station!

169
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,640
Myung-Hoon's mom!

170
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,300
Is it true that Eun-Suk
can't run for class president?

171
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,510
It's a decision made by the PTA.

172
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:53,610
Let me explain.

173
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,470
The reason why I went to the police station is not because I broke the law.

174
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,720
Besides, Eun-Suk shouldn't be
punished for what I've done.

175
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,450
Let's go.

176
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,410
Hello?

177
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,510
Suk-Doo?

178
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,380
Park Suk-Doo?

179
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,510
Dead? Who's dead?

180
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,790
A dead body?

181
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,320
She's dead?

182
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,760
Oh, my Gosh...

183
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,600
They found her body about 3km
away from the beach we were in.

184
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,700
Oh, no...

185
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,660
This is a dream, right?

186
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,700
Honey!

187
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,660
Mom...

188
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,450
We need the kids to stay outside.

189
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,680
This can be too much
for them to handle.

190
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,380
I'll take them outside.

191
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,600
Kids, come with me.

192
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,660
Honey!

193
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,490
How can this happen?

194
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,740
Honey...

195
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,360
Ms. Lee Yun-Shil doesn't have any contacts on her paternal family.

196
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,570
She's an orphan.

197
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,340
I'm the only family she has.

198
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,410
Honey...

199
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,700
You were legally married 4 years ago.

200
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,390
What about the kids?

201
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,680
They're from my previous marriage.

202
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,780
I was always worried about her
because she's very emotional...

203
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,620
...but I never imagined
she'd really do this...

204
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,530
What do you mean?

205
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,350
She tried to commit suicide
in the past out of depression.

206
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,580
Suicide? Suicide?

207
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,390
Don't mind them.

208
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,690
They don't know my wife very well.

209
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:41,650
They're just neighbors.

210
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,690
Excuse me.

211
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,770
This is so dirty...

212
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,500
How can you be so nonchalant
all of a sudden when your wife's dead?

213
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,510
Aren't you sad?

214
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,650
Are you sure you didn't kill her?

215
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:14,570
What? How can you say that?

216
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,700
Calm down.

217
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,790
We can't be sure yet, so calm down.

218
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,530
Yun-Shil needs someone on her side.

219
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,440
Why does she need you on her side?

220
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm her husband!

221
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,410
Get out.

222
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,520
Get out, please.

223
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,640
Get out! Get out!

224
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,670
No! You're acting weird!

225
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,500
Why, I ought to...

226
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,330
You're acting weird.

227
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:47,790
Get out of my way!

228
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,490
Did you just hit Su-Duk? Why?

229
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,370
Why I ought to...

230
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,640
Stop it!

231
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,470
What are you guys doing?

232
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,460
Do you think the white pants killed her?

233
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,340
Does that mean I was with a murderer?

234
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's tell the police.

235
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,340
What are we going to tell them?

236
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,520
About the so-called phone call
with Yun-Shil, the bloody scarf...

237
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,710
...and that he was cheating on her.

238
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,700
The policemen here don't know that.

239
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,360
To be honest with you,
I won't want to take a part in this.

240
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,400
It's scary, and I already
have enough problems as it is.

241
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,750
I'm sure the police will help her.

242
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,570
Uh...the same goes for Su-Duk.

243
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,620
Su-Duk is just a housewife.

244
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,580
Su-Duk's job is to cook and
do the laundry. That's it.

245
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,350
Oh, it's time to make dinner.

246
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,370
Su-Duk needs to go and make dinner.

247
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,480
I better go before there's traffic.

248
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,390
I wish I had a friend like you.

249
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:22,780
Cheer up.

250
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,790
Where there's a will, there's a way.

251
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,670
If you need help,
I'll help you...as a friend.

252
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm scared...

253
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,430
Su-Duk...

254
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,750
Oh, my gosh!

255
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,340
I'm sorry, Yun-Shil!

256
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,700
Hello?

257
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,310
Are you sleeping?

258
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,310
No.

259
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,420
Hold on.

260
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,600
Hello?

261
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,390
Are you sleeping?

262
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,420
I saw a ghost.

263
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,650
I'm scared.

264
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,420
Su-Duk can't sleep tonight.

265
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,570
I tried to let it slide, but I can't.

266
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,360
Now that I want to do something
about it, there's nothing I can do!

267
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,420
I hate it!

268
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,410
We need more information.

269
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,500
What should we do?

270
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,590
I don't know.

271
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,310
We're not the police or detectives.

272
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,620
There's nothing we can do.

273
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,420
We can't get someone
on white pants' trail!

274
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,380
We can't even dig through his house.

275
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,370
There's nothing we can do!

276
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,560
Dig though his house?

277
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,530
No wonder you couldn't reach me!

278
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,540
Come on, I came here during my lunch break because I was worried about you.

279
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,400
You go to your wife
when I need you the most.

280
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,510
I guess it's because you're married.

281
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,720
Tae-Ran...

282
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,690
...you can distinguish the difference between my obligations for my wife...

283
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,310
...and what I do voluntarily
for the person I love, right?

284
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,310
You're like a ray of light to me.

285
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,710
I haven't been this happy in a long time.

286
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,580
What happened?

287
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,730
Oh, no!

288
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,380
If I lose my work, I'll be dead!

289
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,320
Let me take a look.

290
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,310
I think it's the G worm virus.

291
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,420
What's that? What am I
supposed to do?

292
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,430
You'll have to call the repairman.

293
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,320
It'll take a while.
Do you need it right away?

294
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,730
But I need to turn this in by today!

295
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,440
The presentation is tomorrow!

296
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,710
As long as the platter is okay...

297
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,440
...I can recover the data
with the equipment I have.

298
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,740
Do it for me! Where's the equipment?

299
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,400
In my house.

300
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,400
What if I get hurt? I don't want to do it!

301
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,520
Su-Duk can't do it!
Don't ask Su-Duk!

302
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,460
Su-Duk will die if she falls.

303
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
I asked Suk-Doo for help.

304
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,660
I'm sure he'll find a way.

305
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,300
I took a break from tutoring.

306
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,470
Is that the house?

307
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,350
Someone can get on my back.

308
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,750
Who wants to get on?

309
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,310
You're going to give a piggy back ride?

310
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,790
I'm probably the lightest person here.

311
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,770
But you're wearing a skirt, remember?

312
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,730
Then...

313
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,360
What about Su-Duk?

314
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,480
I injured my seventh
cervical vertebra in the past.

315
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,670
Come over here.

316
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,370
Get on.

317
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,590
Hurry! Before someone gets here!

318
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,370
Come on, you're not making a movie!

319
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,600
Hurry up and get on!
We don't have much time.

320
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,770
We can recover the data, right?

321
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,460
I can't write 60,000 words all over again!

322
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,320
You know that too!

323
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,620
Remember what people
called me in college?

324
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,330
Brad Pitt?

325
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,690
The other one.

326
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,760
Hur the McGuyver?

327
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,340
Okay, come in!

328
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,760
Guk-Hee! Good luck!

329
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,300
Thanks.

330
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,490
Bye.

331
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,620
He's so cute.

332
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,460
I thought she worked at a bank.

333
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,700
How did she find the time
to decorate the house like this?

334
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,490
It must've been tough for her.

335
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,580
Look! This is hand-made!

336
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,300
This too!

337
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,750
This is the master bedroom.

338
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,590
It's the white pants' clothes.

339
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,670
Wow, they're all expensive clothes.

340
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,590
Really?

341
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,570
How come the women's
clothes all look cheap?

342
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,580
This used to be mine.

343
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,650
Do you think all the clothes
in this world are yours?

344
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,770
I threw this away!

345
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,560
I sewed the cuffs with
a purple thread. See?

346
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,350
You're right.

347
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:26,510
This used to me mine too.

348
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,470
That means she wore
clothes from the recycle bin.

349
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,710
I'll check if anyone's coming.

350
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,620
I'll go to the other room.

351
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,630
How nice!

352
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,750
3 pairs of white dress shoes?

353
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,460
Oh, my...

354
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,750
Why didn't she get herself
a new pair of shoes?

355
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,670
What's that?

356
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,630
It's Yun-Shil's diary.

357
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,610
She had an abortion.

358
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,780
Abortion? Why did she get an abortion?

359
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,610
Although she didn't give
birth to white pants' kids...

360
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,570
...she wanted to be
a good mother to them.

361
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,680
Yet he cheated on her!

362
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,650
I hate men like him!

363
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,750
We have trouble!

364
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,630
What's wrong?

365
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,620
T-T-The white pants is here!

366
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,710
Oh, no!

367
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,400
I'm getting out of here!

368
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,790
Hurry up!

369
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,710
Are you kidding me?

370
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:48,350
I'm going to leave you behind.

371
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,400
What's wrong?

372
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,440
You can't retrieve my file?

373
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,380
Remember what my nickname is?

374
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,670
Hur the McGuyver!

375
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,310
Thank you so much!

376
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,620
Do you want me to give you a massage?

377
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,460
Oh, my gosh...

378
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,490
Guk-Hee!

379
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,790
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

380
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,790
Guk-Hee! You have a delivery.

381
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,550
A delivery?

382
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:35,730
Yes, a delivery!

383
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,360
I see....thank you.

384
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,340
Bye.

385
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,510
Here you go.

386
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,430
Thanks.

387
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,620
Oh, no.

388
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,650
I've fallen head over heals for you,
and I'm happy about it.

389
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,440
How am I ever going to get over you?

390
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,680
You don't have to get over me.

391
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,610
You won't ever have to.

392
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:36,340
Honey...

393
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,560
What are you doing here at this hour?

394
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm here to fix my computer.

395
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,630
Don't you have work?

396
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,410
I work morning shifts to
accommodate Eun-Suk's schedule.

397
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,360
I told you that three times already.

398
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,320
Oh yeah...

399
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,350
I'm here with my friends...
do you remember them?

400
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:05,370
I have work to do.

401
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,660
I need to concentrate.

402
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,790
Then...Let's go.

403
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,610
Let's go to my house.

404
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,320
You went to Seoul National
University Law School, right?

405
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,530
Tell us what you think
about this drawing.

406
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,520
Give us a call.

407
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,320
Bye.

408
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,700
Honey!

409
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,760
Yes?

410
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,300
I got you a new $1 phone.
It's really nice.

411
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,520
All we need to do is call them and
tell them that we're switching services.

412
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,430
Here you go.

413
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,570
Take care.

414
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,740
Did all three of you get
botox on your brains?

415
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,310
Are you okay?

416
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,570
Are you okay, Tae-Ran?

417
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,470
You must've been scared!

418
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm sorry for laughing.

419
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,720
They were so funny.

420
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,710
Are all married women like that?

421
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,570
Guk-Hee fits in with them.

422
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,720
They look serious, but their
stories are all over the place.

423
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,490
I was worried about you.

424
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:48,330
Hur the McGuyver, Brad Pitt...

425
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,340
What am I going to do with you?

426
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:56,380
I now understand what you
were talking about at that bar cart.

427
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,390
Here you go.

428
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,730
Hey.

429
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,530
What's wrong?

430
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,630
Oh, my husband's acting strange.

431
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,640
I've never seen him at
our place at this hour.

432
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,410
Maybe he got fired.

433
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:34,380
In dramas, some men don't
tell their families they got fired.

434
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,540
He's a competent employee.

435
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,540
He's respected at work.

436
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,450
Yes, he looks like one.

437
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,430
Why?

438
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,470
Nothing.

439
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,760
What is it?

440
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,630
It's nothing serious, but
it was the way he looked at us.

441
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,530
I felt like he was
dissing his wife's friends.

442
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,340
Why?

443
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,470
We tried hard to explain what happened!

444
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,490
Don't you get it?

445
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,770
He wasn't even listening.

446
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,790
Am I wrong?

447
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,400
He seemed to be dissing you too.

448
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,600
Why would my husband
look down on me?

449
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,670
I think he's tired today.

450
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,620
He's not usually like this.

451
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,670
What did he mean by
getting botox on the brain?

452
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,630
He was talking about us, right?

453
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,340
Get botox on our brains? How?

454
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,570
It's just an inside joke.

455
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,350
Don't worry about it.

456
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,350
If there's wrong, then that's good news.

457
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,560
A divorcee like me can sense problems in other couples too.

458
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,660
Even if he looks down on you...

459
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:52,490
...you'll be fine as long as
he doesn't cheat on you.

460
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,720
He's not cheating on you, right?

461
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,530
He was with another woman
when we went to the beach, right?

462
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:04,470
You're right...

463
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,430
Is that what's going on?

464
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,400
No.

465
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,670
Do you guys do it at night?

466
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:27,410
Well...we have to work...
we're tired at night.

467
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,620
Let's read her diary.

468
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,380
You really do have
a problem with your husband!

469
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,790
If men don't do it at home,
then they do it elsewhere!

470
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,420
That's not true!

471
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,630
My husband will never do that!

472
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,540
Why are you getting mad at us?

473
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,510
He will never do that to me!

474
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:55,370
He doesn't look down on me,
and he doesn't cheat on me!

475
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:00,720
I know my husband,
and he'll never do that!

476
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,780
Thank you.

477
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,760
There aren't that many people
here because it's members-only.

478
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,700
I got you a membership card.

479
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,410
Come and get yourself
a drink anytime you want.

480
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,650
You need a break and some privacy.

481
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:47,370
And during that break, you can call me with this brand new cell phone.

482
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,520
When did you buy this?

483
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,660
I'm sorry, my number's already
on speed dial number one.

484
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:17,630
Do you know what comes to my mind whenever I look at you?

485
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,550
So this is what femme fatale is.

486
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,390
A woman who reads me
and understand me.

487
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,300
She's irresistible.

488
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,600
She's so seductive, I can't
draw myself away from her.

489
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,650
Femme fatale.

490
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:49,330
Do you know what comes to mind whenever I look at you?

491
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,710
So this is what homme fatale is.

492
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,570
He's nice, yet tough.

493
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,780
But he seems incomplete
without my tough.

494
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,320
He's so seductive, I can't
draw myself away from him.

495
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,590
Homme fatale.

496
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,300
I want to do whatever I can for you.

497
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,350
I've always had a crush on you,
and now you're with me.

498
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,420
I want to fill you up so
I won't have any regrets.

499
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,780
Mom!

500
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,430
Look at this!

501
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,740
This is a $180 eraser.

502
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,620
I got it from Dad.

503
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,760
Mom! Look at this pencil case!

504
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:58,440
Remember Jung-Guk?
His family owns a golf course.

505
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,680
He has one just like this!

506
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,780
What?

507
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,450
Honey, did you buy those for the kids?

508
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,440
What's this?

509
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,770
That's not what I got you!

510
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,370
Did you buy a new cell phone?

511
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,670
Why did you buy
something so expensive?

512
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,700
We don't have any money.

513
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:27,360
You don't even know what luxury is.

514
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,760
Beautiful luxuries can
touch the hearts of people.

515
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,780
You don't even have that notion.

516
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,670
You're so dry.

517
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,400
Luxury?

518
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,520
I know what luxury is.

519
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,690
I want designer's brands too,
but we don't have the money.

520
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,490
That's why I don't even
dream about getting one.

521
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,470
I didn't buy it with my own money.

522
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,560
I got it as a gift from an interviewee.

523
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,340
You should've told me!

524
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:54,770
From who?

525
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:56,550
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

526
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,310
Just wipe that flour off your face.

527
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,560
Satisfied?

528
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,580
I said, wipe that flour off your face!

529
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,440
It's still on?

530
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:15,630
Just go and wash your face! You're getting it on the cellphone...

531
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,520
I'm so sleepy...

532
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,750
You're having a tough time
nowadays, aren't you?

533
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:45,400
I was so sad when
I read Yun-Shil's diary.

534
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,690
Why would such a
hard-working person die?

535
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,500
Why didn't her husband
know about this?

536
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,490
Why is everyone having
such a tough time?

537
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,330
I guess that's life.

538
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,350
It's so sad.

539
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,310
To be honest with you,
it's been tough for me too.

540
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,720
At least I'm much
better off than Yun-Shil.

541
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,730
At least I have you.

542
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,780
You're such a good husband.

543
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,760
What was that about?

544
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,690
I only gave you a nudge.

545
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,520
You're overreacting.

546
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,560
I'm too busy with work.

547
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,490
I want to sleep.

548
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:40,690
How can you do this to me?

549
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,450
You've never done this to me before!

550
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,680
You're acting strange.

551
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,680
Let's just sleep. I'm tired.

552
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:56,730
Are you cheating on me?

553
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,770
Cheating on you?

554
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,590
Why are you accusing
me all of a sudden?

555
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:13,440
Did those women with botox on their brains tell you that I'm cheating?

556
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,340
Is that what you guys talk about?

557
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Why do you want to hang out
with those losers?

558
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,680
Don't you have anything better to do?

559
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,400
What's wrong with you?

560
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,470
You don't know anything about them.

561
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,650
Why are you dissing them
without a good reason?

562
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:29,470
Without a good reason?

563
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,500
Do you want me to tell you why they're losers?

564
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,730
Why are the three women with botox on their brains hanging out together?

565
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,680
There's a woman who
wears used clothes...

566
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,320
...and refused to give birth in order
to raise someone else's kids.

567
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Yet her husband cheated on her.

568
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,600
There must be another reason
why a poor woman like that is dead.

569
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,630
Do you just feel sorry for her?

570
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,740
Did it ever occur to you
that she may be incompetent?

571
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,620
Why wear used clothes when
you have money to buy new ones?

572
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,720
Why get an abortion when
you can be a good mother?

573
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,560
Why would her husband
cheat on her if she's attractive?

574
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,690
Sacrifice? No, she's just incompetent!

575
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:12,390
We have wrinkles on our
brains so we can think!

576
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,310
Not to drive ourselves into fantasy!

577
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,610
Understand?

578
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,460
They can't make progress
because they think that's sacrifice!

579
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,310
They're losers because
they think like that!

580
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,330
How...how can you say that?

581
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,760
Stop!

582
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,400
That's enough.

583
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,790
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

584
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,490
Good night!

585
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,540
I'm tired.

586
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:03,370
I never knew that's what
you thought about them.

587
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,520
What are you talking about?

588
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,590
Is that what you think about me too?

589
00:44:10,590 --> 00:44:12,690
I bring used clothes and
used furniture home too.

590
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,730
I don't even think about
having a third child.

591
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,340
Is that because I'm incompetent?

592
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,490
If you cheat on me, does that mean
it's because I'm unattractive?

593
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,790
If that scares you,
then you should try harder.

594
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,790
Try harder! Make some progress!

595
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,410
You're wrong!

596
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,460
If we keep this up...

597
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,670
...you'll look down on me and cheat on me like Yun-Shil's husband did.

598
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,650
Then you'll blame it on me!

599
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,560
No way!

600
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,440
I won't let that happen!

601
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,450
You should change the way you think!

602
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,450
Don't laugh at me.

603
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:44,780
I'm Gyung Guk-Hee.

604
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,610
What about Gyung Guk-Hee?

605
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,730
I'm Gyung Guk-Hee,
the woman you wanted to marry.

606
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,790
I'm working hard to
make it through this life.

607
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:55,480
You don't have a reason to diss me.

608
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,630
The same goes for Yun-Shil.

609
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,460
It's the white pants
who's wrong, not Yun-Shil.

610
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,530
If she has been wronged,
then I will help her.

611
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,550
I'll do whatever I can to bring justice.

612
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,490
Mind your own business.

613
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,790
Don't look down on me!

614
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:12,560
Don't yell at me!

615
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,590
- Are you on drugs or something?
- Stop!

616
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,660
That's enough.

617
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,680
I don't want to talk
about it anymore. Let's eat.

618
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,780
Make sure you do that
camping exercise with Eun-Suk.

619
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,440
He's been looking forward
to this for a long time.

620
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:30,740
Come home by 4.

621
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,770
Good morning.

622
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:41,760
I'm here to bother you on a
peaceful Saturday morning.

623
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:47,640
The thing is, they're verified my alibi.

624
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,590
It was my friend, not I,
who went to Sokcho that night.

625
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:57,590
I proved that I have
nothing to do with Sokcho.

626
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,730
That is the reason why
I'd like to sue you for slandering.

627
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:15,570
I hope you're loaded.

628
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,370
Bye.

629
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:31,400
Did you see that?

630
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,450
Do you still think I'm looking
down on you for no reason?

631
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,300
Go and beg him.

632
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,710
Beg him, and make sure he changes
his mind by the end of the week.

633
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,480
Mom...

634
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,370
Let's go.

635
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:04,470
Hold on.

636
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,390
Can we talk? Are you by yourself?

637
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,650
I'm Yun-Shil.

638
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,420
Hello?

639
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,580
Yun-Shil?

640
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,700
Are you really Yun-Shil?

641
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,410
I don't believe you.

642
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,730
I'm Yun-Shil, the one said...

643
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:37,650
...being a good wife is
the hardest thing you can be.

644
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,510
It's hard to be a good wife.

645
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,560
That's the hardest thing you can be.

646
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,350
Yun-Shil?

647
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,750
Are you really Yun-Shil?

648
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:54,580
Are you alive?

649
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,560
Can you come over?

650
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:00,730
Don't tell anyone.

651
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,540
I'm in Sokcho.

652
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:12,340
Tae-Ran, do you know what you
can never hide in this world?

653
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:17,370
Sneezing, poverty,
ticklish, and....love?

654
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,420
My friends tell me that
I look happy nowadays.

655
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,380
My assistant asked me
if I won the lottery.

656
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,570
Let's go somewhere for the weekend.

657
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,500
One night two days.

658
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,590
How about it?

659
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:37,380
Aren't you tired?

660
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,440
Don't you need a break
for the weekend?

661
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:46,670
The best part about dating is
that you always feel rejuvenated.

662
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,410
I'm energized to the max.

663
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,650
Then, do you want to go to Sokcho instead of Yangpyeong?

664
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,680
There are mountains and the beach.

665
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,440
Okay! Sure thing!

666
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,300
You don't have to prepare anything!

667
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:05,440
I'll arrange everything
from the car to the place.

668
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,380
That's great!

669
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,480
I needed a man like you.

670
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:12,340
See you soon.

671
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,450
If Suk-Doo can drive, that'll be great.

672
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,680
You didn't tell anyone that
we're going to meet Yun-Shil, right?

673
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,620
Of course not.

674
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,720
Okay, my husband will be home soon.

675
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,590
I'll leave as soon as he gets here.

676
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,410
Bye.

677
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:44,560
Honey, the kids are waiting.

678
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,340
Where are you?

679
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,620
A workshop?

680
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:54,740
Mr. Yeom's wife is sick from a cold.

681
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,690
I have to go as his replacement.

682
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:59,770
Take care of Eun-Suk for me.

683
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:01,410
He's supposed to do a
camping exercise with his dad.

684
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,320
I can't replace you.

685
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,720
Don't mind other people's business,
and do it right.

686
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,310
That's your job!

687
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,540
My boss is coming! Bye!

688
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,370
Tae-Ran!

689
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,690
Myung-Pil!

690
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,340
Did you wait long?

691
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,540
Nope!

692
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:29,570
Shall we?

693
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,490
Let's go!

694
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,760
Eun-Suk...

695
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,400
Mom...Dad's not coming?

696
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:08,420
Why don't we do something
besides camping?

697
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,450
Why don't we make a sand castle
at the beach with Ki-Suk?

698
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:14,680
Yes!

699
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,470
Okay!

700
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:17,440
Good? Good!

701
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,750
I'll make a nice sand castle for you.

702
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,630
Hi!

703
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,410
Workshop?

704
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:37,430
Men who leave during weekends
usually have something to hide.

705
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:46,470
Hi.

706
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:47,540
Hi.

707
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,730
Hi.

708
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:52,340
We have more guests with us.

709
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:26,460
If Yun-Shil is alive,
then whose corpse was that?

710
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,440
I have a headache.

711
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,300
I hate this!

712
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,750
You didn't get a call from a ghost, right?

713
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,790
I'm glad she's alive.

714
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,720
I'm so glad.

715
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,600
Mom, I want ice cream.

716
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,570
Okay, let's go.

717
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,450
Myung-Pil!

718
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,680
There aren't any guests
named Lee Yun-Shil.

719
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:15,440
She should be here by now,
but she hasn't even called.

720
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,380
Maybe it was from a wrong number.

721
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,430
Are you sure we're supposed to
see her at the condo coffee shop?

722
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,530
This is the place.

723
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:27,370
Mom, I want to build a sand castle!

724
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:28,410
Me too!

725
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,790
Do you want to build one with me?

726
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,640
Yes!

727
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,500
We're at the beach.

728
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,420
Of course they should go see the beach.

729
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,310
I'll be with the kids. Call me.

730
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,310
Let's go.

731
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,300
Did I fall asleep?

732
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,300
Was I asleep for a long time?

733
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,510
Did your arms hurt?

734
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:13,310
Not at all!

735
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:21,360
I was happy to see you sleep like a baby.

736
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,670
I must feel relaxed when I'm with you.

737
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:29,700
I've been taking melatonin
for 3 years because of insomnia.

738
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,730
I haven't slept so soundly in a long time.

739
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:40,300
Do you want to go to our room?

740
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,360
I'll be your human melatonin.

741
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:46,350
Sure.

742
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,740
I haven't walked side by side
with a woman in a long time.

743
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,740
Then what about all those times
you walked with Guk-Hee?

744
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,650
What kind of a husband will want
to hold his wife by the shoulder?

745
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:10,570
We walk front and back.

746
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,640
The other men who are
watching us will say...

747
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,790
'How did he get a woman like her?'

748
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,620
You can say you're a trophy.

749
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,690
Trophy?

750
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:30,300
Does that mean I'm a trophy wife?

751
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:33,770
I thought you said
I'm the new good wife?

752
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,500
You'll be a new good wife...

753
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,510
...if someone takes that trophy
and gets a marriage license.

754
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,500
You're such a smooth talker.

755
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,480
Shall we get some beer?

756
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:55,430
Hey! Hey!

757
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,340
Finish what you're eating first.

758
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,310
I was just in a hurry!

759
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:02,420
The clerk told me that there's another coffee shop on the 7th floor too.

760
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:05,350
Maybe that's where Yun-Shil
might be right now.

761
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,740
Go upstairs.

762
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,390
I'll check on the kids first.

763
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:18,540
Hurry.

764
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,470
Tae-Ran!

765
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,380
Let's get out of here!

766
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,340
Why?

767
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:38,580
Hurry! Hurry!

768
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,430
Hurry! Get in!

769
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,340
G-G-Guk-Hee is here?

770
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,720
Yes, it was Guk-Hee!

771
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,700
What do we do?

772
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,340
Excuse me. Sorry...

773
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,660
Did you find her?

774
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:40,680
It's 8th floor.

775
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,420
We need to go up one more floor.

776
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,330
It's okay! It's okay!

777
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,650
She didn't see us!

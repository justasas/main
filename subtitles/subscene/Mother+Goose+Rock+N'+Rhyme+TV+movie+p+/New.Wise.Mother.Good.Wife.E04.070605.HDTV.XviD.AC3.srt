1
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,880
Did you find her?

2
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,850
It's 8th floor.

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,810
We need to go up one more floor.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,680
It's okay! It's okay!

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,690
She didn't see us!

6
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,660
Wasn't that your husband?

7
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,590
Do you know who the woman is?

8
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,500
9th floor!

9
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,530
They went to 9th floor!

10
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,850
- Episode 4 -
Guk-Hee! Guk-Hee!

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,880
Guk-Hee! Guk-Hee!

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,730
Hold on.

13
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,870
No...

14
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,810
Guk-Hee!

15
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,530
Guk-Hee!

16
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,680
Honey! Honey!

17
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,600
Honey...Honey! Honey!

18
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,810
Guk-Hee! Are you okay?

19
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,610
Why is Guk-Hee here?

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,570
What happened?

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,620
Are you okay?

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes, I'm okay.

23
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,880
Get dressed.

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,580
You might catch a cold.

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,560
I'll make coffee for you.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't feel like coffee right now.

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,900
Let's go.

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,550
No, don't worry about me.

29
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,640
Let's stay here and have fun.

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
I don't feel like having fun.

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,570
I'll take a shower.

32
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,920
You should start packing.

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,560
How did she find out?

34
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,930
Mom!

35
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,960
Look what Suk-Doo made for me!

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,690
He made this for me!

37
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,580
Mom, did you get hurt?

38
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,540
Do you need a kiss?

39
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,960
No, I'm fine.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,730
Mommy's fine.

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,640
Workshop? My team?

42
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,610
Oh! Yes, we have a workshop.

43
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,590
I forgot.

44
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,990
Yes, there's a workshop.

45
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,970
Where's the workshop at?

46
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,810
I don't know.

47
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,950
Mr. Choi, where's the workshop at?

48
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,900
You don't know?

49
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,620
Why not?

50
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,930
No one here knows.

51
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,510
Only the ones who are going know.

52
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,670
You don't sound like you have a cold.

53
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,500
A cold? Yes, I do.

54
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,810
I'm coughing a lot.

55
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:35,780
According to my husband,
it was your wife who has a cold.

56
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,600
No one's at the coffee shop
on 8th floor either.

57
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,600
Maybe it wasn't Yun-Shil who called.

58
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,960
Who called then? A ghost?

59
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,760
Stop it! You're scaring me!

60
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,790
Maybe it's just a prank call.

61
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,920
This is killing Su-Duk.

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,780
Something's always going wrong.

63
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,830
I can't take it anymore.

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,570
First, a person's missing, then she dies, and now her husband's cheating on her.

65
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,670
Why are you hitting me?

66
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,860
Do you want to wait here?

67
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,790
It's been more than 3 hours.

68
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,720
What? 3 hours?

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,910
No, Su-Duk needs to go home and cook!

70
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,760
Let me go home and cook!

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,550
Cook! Cook! Cook!
All you do is cook!

72
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,830
Let's go home.

73
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,740
I want to go home.

74
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,610
My wife?

75
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,590
I got caught!

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,520
What's wrong with you?

77
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,870
You should've just
weaseled your way out of it!

78
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,580
Why are you blaming me!

79
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,600
Don't worry, Myung-Pil.

80
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,740
There's always a way out.

81
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,990
Even if you get bitten by a tiger, you'll
be safe as long as you stay focused.

82
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,950
Even if you get caught by your wife,
you'll be safe as long as you play dumb.

83
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,620
What are you talking about?

84
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,500
Do you know what I had
to go through to learn all this?

85
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,590
I can't tell you for free.

86
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,860
Tell me! Now!

87
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,940
What do I need to do? Tell me.

88
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,740
Are you okay?

89
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,830
Okay with what?

90
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,560
We saw everything.

91
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,980
Don't act dumb.

92
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,780
Thanks for driving.

93
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,540
You're welcome.

94
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,620
I only did what I was supposed to do.

95
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,770
Goodnight.

96
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,780
I'll call you guys later.

97
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,920
Let's go, Eun-Suk.

98
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,900
Goodbye.

99
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,550
Wash your hands and brush your teeth.

100
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,630
Okay.

101
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,550
Who's here?

102
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,950
It's you.

103
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,500
Where were you?

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,750
I was waiting for you.

105
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,630
Don't stay out too late.

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,730
Just act dumb.

107
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,580
Even if she catches you red-handed...

108
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,720
...she might not say anything
if you pretend nothing happened.

109
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:19,690
There's no point in fighting, and
it's not that easy to demand a divorce.

110
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,700
You scared me!

111
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,690
What are you doing there?

112
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,800
I brought some kimchi.

113
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,570
It's a Sunday! You should've slept in. Why are you up already?

114
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,820
Good.

115
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,540
Come to church with me.

116
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,920
I want to serve everyone coffee
since I'm the new senior deaconess.

117
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,730
How many coffee pots do you have?

118
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,520
Give me everything you have.

119
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,890
Guk-Hee, are you sick?

120
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,680
No.

121
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,870
I think we have about 3 coffee pots.

122
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,760
Would you like some tea?

123
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,530
No, I just need water.

124
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,660
Congratulations on becoming
a senior deaconess.

125
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,820
Thank you. Hi.

126
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,730
Come to the evening meeting.

127
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,990
Sure, see you then.

128
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,920
Have some coffee.

129
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,570
- Thank you.
- Hi. Welcome.

130
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,710
Guess what?

131
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,750
She divorced her husband because
her husband cheated on her.

132
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,550
She's not even young.

133
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,580
She's more than 60 years old.

134
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,750
It doesn't matter how old you are.

135
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,960
It's shocking to hear that
your husband cheated on you.

136
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,640
She probably couldn't stand it.

137
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,910
Still, that's wrong.

138
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:31,990
I've come to realize that you'll be
better off if you just forgive your spouse.

139
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,850
I thought you didn't forgive him either.

140
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,690
That's why I'm living
the rest of my life in regret.

141
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:50,780
I threw a fit and threatened
to kill myself and my husband...

142
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,890
...when he cheated on me.

143
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,870
I guess he got sick of me since then.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:03,660
We barely talked
to each other after that.

145
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,630
Marriage is mandated by heaven.

146
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,920
You need to care for each other,
instead of thinking of ways to break up.

147
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,830
That's the wise thing to do.

148
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,670
Good morning.

149
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,700
What's for breakfast?

150
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,730
Fish stew.

151
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,550
Come home for dinner.

152
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,670
It's a Sunday.

153
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,650
Of course I will.

154
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,530
I'll go and wash up.

155
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,620
Guk-Hee invited you too?

156
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,750
And?

157
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,590
It'll be stranger if I refuse to go.

158
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,990
I should go.

159
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,900
How can the three of us eat together?

160
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,770
No! I think that's wrong.

161
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,930
Just tell her that you're too sick to come.

162
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,670
Are you scared of Guk-Hee?

163
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm not scared of her.

164
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,770
I just can't stand her.

165
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,820
Besides, I don't even know
what she's thinking about.

166
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,610
Then let's go and find out.

167
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,700
I don't want to run away.

168
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm okay.

169
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,850
Okay then.

170
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,990
Whatever Guk-Hee does, just stay put.

171
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,750
I'll protect you whenever you need me.

172
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,700
Understand?

173
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,700
The door's opened.

174
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,970
Come in.

175
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,800
Am I late?

176
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,890
It's for Eun-Suk's homework.

177
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:41,520
He needs to do a camping exercise
with his dad and turn the picture in.

178
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,990
They're doing it today because
they didn't get to do it yesterday.

179
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Hi! Hold on.

180
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,620
- Hold on!
- Ki-Suk, Daddy's getting tired!

181
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,920
Why isn't this working?

182
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,780
Honey, you're supposed to put this in.

183
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,680
Try again.

184
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,840
Let's put this up here.

185
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,720
That looks good.

186
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,860
Doesn't this look good?

187
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,620
Yes!

188
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,640
Now it's time to flip this over.

189
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,750
- Hot! Hot! Hot!
- Be careful!

190
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,950
Eun-Suk, take a picture
to turn it in as homework.

191
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,610
Then what about me?

192
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,760
I need the whole family in the picture.

193
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,540
Tae-Ran!

194
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,610
Can you take a picture for us?

195
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,930
Tae-Ran!

196
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,790
Tae-Ran, can you take a picture for us?

197
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,630
Okay...

198
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,890
Come over here.

199
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,800
You too, Eun-Suk.

200
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,890
Everyone smile and look excited.

201
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,650
Cheese!

202
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,770
Can I take another one for myself?

203
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,810
Sure.

204
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,550
Tae-Ran wants to take a picture too.

205
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:01,710
Say kimchi this time!

206
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,790
Let me see.

207
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,770
Let's eat what we made.

208
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,990
- Sit down.
- How did it turn out?

209
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:12,600
That looks hot. Be careful!

210
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,580
Everyone came out looking nice.

211
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,560
Thanks, Tae-Ran.

212
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,990
Eun-Suk, you're done
with your homework now!

213
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,510
Dad! Next time you have
to go on a real camp with me.

214
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't back out like you did yesterday.

215
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,930
Okay, okay. How many times
do I have to promise you?

216
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,820
Your dinner will be ready soon.

217
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,890
Honey, answer that.

218
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,800
Eat it slowly. It's hot.

219
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,740
Hello?

220
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,610
Yes, Mom.

221
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,720
A church get-together?

222
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Oh yeah! I'm sorry, I forgot!

223
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,620
I'll be right there.

224
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,620
Bye.

225
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,700
You forgot Mom's church get-together!

226
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,740
We were supposed to eat
with her church people!

227
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,920
Hurry up. Let's go.

228
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,820
What about Tae-Ran?

229
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,680
I'm sorry, Tae-Ran.

230
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,910
It's for my mom's church,
but only the family is invited.

231
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,700
Oh...You should go then.

232
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,600
Go inside and get dressed.

233
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,770
Okay!

234
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,710
Just go with the kids.

235
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,520
I'll stay here and eat with Tae-Ran.

236
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,560
I need you with me!

237
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,630
Tae-Ran, I'm sorry.

238
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Bye.

239
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,770
Grow up, will you?

240
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,690
Everybody is with their family
on a Sunday evening.

241
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,640
Look what you're doing here
in someone else's home.

242
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,620
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

243
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,680
It's about time you settle down
and live like an adult.

244
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,640
I feel sorry for you because
you're wandering like a tramper.

245
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,690
Tramper? What do you mean?

246
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,850
I know more about life than you do.

247
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,550
You become an adult after getting married and having kids in due time.

248
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,750
You don't know what it means
to have your own family.

249
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,870
You lust over what's not yours
because you don't know life.

250
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,750
Find your own and cherish it.

251
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,640
Then one of these days, you'll
realize how patient I'm being right now.

252
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,660
Bye.

253
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,850
She invited your girlfriend to your place?

254
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,790
Your wife really is something.

255
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,540
Why do you think she did that for?

256
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,640
She's marking her territory.

257
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,690
This is my boundary, so keep off.

258
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,520
If you don't, you'll get hurt.

259
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,790
It's a warning.

260
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,770
Most women cry and fight
with their husband.

261
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,660
Guk-Hee really is something.

262
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,830
Darn, I had fun until now.

263
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,770
Nothing's free in life.

264
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,920
Ever since then, she won't
pick up the phone.

265
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,800
What's wrong with her?

266
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Are you going to continue
seeing your mistress?

267
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,910
I'm not scared of my wife.

268
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,570
She'll give it up one of these days.

269
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,940
Myung-Pil, I have a bad
feeling about this.

270
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,590
I can smell it.

271
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,680
Smell what?

272
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,530
The smell of a dynamite wick burning.

273
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:06,990
The smell of a huge explosion on its way.

274
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,790
Guk-Hee!

275
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,850
Why did you buy so much food?

276
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,510
Do you want to feed good food
to that husband of yours?

277
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,650
I'm only doing my job.

278
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,630
You're too nice.

279
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,860
You'll rot away one of these days.

280
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,980
One of these days?
I've already rotted away.

281
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,790
Same here.

282
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,900
- That looks heavy. Let me help you.
- I'm okay. I'll put it here.

283
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,860
Now that everyone's here, tell us.

284
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,540
What did the police say?

285
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,810
They're going to cremate
Yun-Shil tomorrow.

286
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,730
Cremate her?

287
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:57,580
They found her ID and a suicide note
in Sokcho, where the body was found.

288
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:05,810
Does that mean Yun-Shil didn't call me?

289
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,950
I guess it was a prank call.

290
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:11,760
Now that I think about it, she did
seem like the type to commit suicide.

291
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
Remember how she jumped
into the ocean in Sokcho?

292
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,690
That looked odd.

293
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,970
Do you want to go see her get cremated?

294
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,580
I don't know.

295
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,980
I don't know anything anymore.

296
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,830
My whole life is in a mess now.

297
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,700
Hello?

298
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,550
I called earlier.

299
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,580
Is Tae-Ran back?

300
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,730
When do you think she'll be back?

301
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,610
It's already been more than 2 hours.

302
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,600
She usually doesn't answer her
phone when she has writer's block.

303
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,910
I see.

304
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,900
She's not sick or
anything like that, right?

305
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,620
I don't think so.

306
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,980
I see. Bye.

307
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,840
Did you two get in a fight?

308
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,530
No, I just want him now...as my own.

309
00:24:52,970 --> 00:25:01,730
I now know what exactly
what I envied and wanted.

310
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:58,500
Tae-Ran, I want to hear your voice.

311
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,980
Call me after you
get this message, okay?

312
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,800
Mr. Choi! Just leave a message
like I told you to.

313
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,760
She'll call.

314
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,880
Okay, bye.

315
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,840
Did I wake you?

316
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,600
I came outside to answer the phone because I didn't want to wake you up.

317
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,580
You're so mean.

318
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,650
Are you sure you're my husband?

319
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,790
What?

320
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,600
I thought my husband will stay loyal.

321
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,570
What?

322
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,780
I'm barely holding on.

323
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,520
If you aggravate me any further,
I don't know what I will do.

324
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,800
What?

325
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,620
Honey! Honey!

326
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,630
What a lonely way to leave this world.

327
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,600
I wonder what drove her to death.

328
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,830
Life is tough for everyone.

329
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,580
She should've gone through with it.

330
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:38,550
She should've asked us for comfort...

331
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,950
...even if she feels
betrayed by her husband.

332
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,980
Do you think she would've
been happier if she was alive?

333
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,620
At least she'll have hope.

334
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,870
Honey!

335
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,660
Is your husband back?

336
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,670
Did you eat?

337
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,710
You look pale.

338
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,500
You should eat something.

339
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:31,510
Try this rice cake. It's good.

340
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:34,850
Thanks.

341
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,940
Who...

342
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,600
It's a ghost!

343
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,750
It's me.

344
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,980
It's me, Yun-Shil...

345
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,690
Yun-Shil?

346
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,530
Yun-Shil!

347
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,590
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil!

348
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,700
What's going on?

349
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,970
Where were you?

350
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,800
Whose corpse did we
cremate yesterday?

351
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,570
I think my head is about to explode.

352
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,760
I hate it when this happens!

353
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,840
She probably needs glucose.

354
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,930
Let her drink here.

355
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,980
Here, drink this.

356
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,790
Should we call white pants?

357
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,740
No, we don't know what happened.

358
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,910
Let's ask her what happened
when she wakes up.

359
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:58,790
Let's not call him until
we're sure that she's safe.

360
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,690
Are you okay?

361
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,790
Can you recognize us?

362
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,510
Yun-Shil.

363
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,930
Everything's going to be okay now.

364
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,860
Let's go outside.

365
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,990
What happened?

366
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,840
Let's wait until she gets better.

367
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,750
Wait until she gets better? Where?

368
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,610
Here?

369
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,560
Just the two of us?

370
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,520
No! I'm scared!

371
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,560
I'll visit often.

372
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,970
You can't stay with us 24 hours a day.

373
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,660
I'll come by whenever I can.

374
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,680
I'm glad Yun-Shil's still alive.

375
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,530
Where is she going to sleep?

376
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,860
I can't sleep when
someone's next to me.

377
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,800
There's nothing to eat in this house.

378
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,970
Something to eat?

379
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,920
Su-Duk has a lot of things
to eat in her house!

380
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,650
I can't eat them at home because
my husband gave me mean stares.

381
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,880
I can eat them here with you! Yes!

382
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,990
Mom, where are we going?

383
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,610
- To the beach!
- Yay!

384
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,610
- Let's have fun.
- Okay!

385
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,770
Go and get your bags.

386
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,930
Okay!

387
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,660
Do we have to leave on a holiday?

388
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,730
We have to come back in a day.

389
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,550
Yes, we have to go.

390
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:54,720
We need a family trip
and some time to talk.

391
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,990
Take this icebox downstairs.

392
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,560
Sheesh...

393
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,620
Tae-Ran, call me if you can.

394
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,830
Hello?

395
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,560
Hello? Tae-Ran!

396
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,530
Myung-Pil, I'm sorry.

397
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:05,560
I tired not to call...
I know I shouldn't, but...

398
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,800
Where are you?

399
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,610
Where are you, Tae-Ran?

400
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,600
At the bar we drank together...

401
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,520
Let's have fun.

402
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,620
Okay!

403
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,990
Honey! Open the door!

404
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:27,560
Mr. Yeom's father just passed away!

405
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,830
It was a car accident!

406
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,590
I have to go! Stay home.

407
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,620
Tae-Ran...

408
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,650
Myung-Pil...

409
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:02,670
Myung-Pil...

410
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:37,600
You should eat at home, not here!

411
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,520
This is so good.

412
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,910
Jang-Mi, come and eat with me.

413
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,650
What's wrong with everyone?

414
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,940
She won't stop eating,
Yun-Shil is like a living corpse...

415
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,540
...and Guk-Hee looks like
she's about to join her!

416
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,970
Everything is in chaos!

417
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,700
I hate it when things are in chaos!

418
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,690
Is this what marriage is like?

419
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,630
I couldn't have imagined...

420
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,950
Awesome.

421
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,930
There's a golf group for
people in the media.

422
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,940
The VP from your company
is a member there too.

423
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,820
You should start playing golf with me.

424
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,840
This place is nice.

425
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,880
Here you go.

426
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,640
Cheers.

427
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,950
This is for you.

428
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:01,780
I was going to use this house as
a work area, but I rarely come here.

429
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,630
You can come over to rest
whenever you want.

430
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,710
You look tired.

431
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,580
You need a place to rest.

432
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
I'm begging you, Tae-Ran.

433
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,510
Please don't disappear like you did.

434
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,930
I don't think I can live without you.

435
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,610
Please, Tae-Ran.

436
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,600
Honey...were you with Tae-Ran?

437
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,840
How can you say that?

438
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,970
Don't you have any
emotions in your brain?

439
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,760
Mr. Yeom's husband passed away!

440
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,960
Aren't you sad for him?

441
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,970
Honey!

442
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:31,750
Why do you keep lying to me?

443
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,850
Tell me the truth.

444
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,650
You met Tae-Ran, right?

445
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,600
Stop it!

446
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,850
Honey!

447
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,690
Did you hide the golf clubs?

448
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,610
Can you hear me?

449
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:18,620
It's me, Guk-Hee.

450
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,670
Tae-Ran called to tell you
to hide your golf clubs.

451
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,950
You're my husband and our kid's father.

452
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,940
We're a family.

453
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,890
We should stay loyal to each other.

454
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,910
What are you trying to do?

455
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,890
I waited patiently.

456
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,510
You should get over her by now.

457
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,680
What are you trying to do?

458
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,870
I don't know either.

459
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,870
Tell me what to do.

460
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:06,720
We should just pretend
nothing ever happened.

461
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,510
But I can't.

462
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,730
Now what should I do?

463
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,660
Tell me what to do.

464
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,900
Why are you so cheeky?

465
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,710
Don't you feel bad for me?

466
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,770
I'm being honest because I feel bad.

467
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,780
Since when?

468
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,600
I heard you tell Tae-Ran at the bar cart that you should've married her instead.

469
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,540
Was it before that?

470
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,530
Ever since that day!

471
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,690
I still don't have a house.

472
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,560
I was lonely and desolate.

473
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,910
I lost all courage and hope for tomorrow.

474
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:44,860
I wanted someone to make me feel better, and Tae-Ran was with me.

475
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,830
Lonely and desolate?

476
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,990
Same here!

477
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,910
I was afraid and depressed too.

478
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:52,880
We were in the same situation.
Why did you have to cheat?

479
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,650
Because this is your fault!

480
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,560
I can't stand you, Guk-Hee.

481
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,590
I feel like breaking down.

482
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,880
We're not going anywhere!

483
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,890
Is it my fault that
we don't have a future?

484
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,510
I did my best.

485
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,900
I worked as hard as others.

486
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,630
Then whose fault is it?

487
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,700
We don't have a way out.

488
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,960
Our home, our family, and
our future is getting nowhere.

489
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,780
I have to do anything for you!

490
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,760
I can't stand it!

491
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,810
Life is tough.

492
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:27,500
There's nothing to look forward to.

493
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,860
I only have responsibilities.

494
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,770
Can't you understand me?

495
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,950
Just leave me alone.

496
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,530
How can I leave you alone?

497
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:42,540
You're cheating on me!

498
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,990
That's exactly the reason
why I can't stand you!

499
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,640
Where are you going?

500
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,600
Honey!

501
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,750
Honey!

502
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:26,990
Honey! Honey! Honey!

503
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,980
Myung-Pil!

504
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,600
What are we going to do?

505
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,720
What's wrong with my life, Tae-Ran?

506
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:04,730
I feel like going crazy
whenever I'm home.

507
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,600
I don't feel relaxed even
when I'm away from home.

508
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,860
Everything seems to be in a chaos.

509
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,630
Everything's a mess.

510
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,950
I'm so confused.

511
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:28,540
I feel as though I can't get a moment's rest anywhere in this world.

512
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,540
Is this what life's is, Tae-Ran?

513
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:30,560
Honey!

514
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,820
Good morning!

515
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,680
Myung-Pil, you're...

516
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,890
Leave me alone.
I'm tired.

517
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:18,870
- Mr. Hur Myung-Pil?
- Yes?

518
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,780
I have a package for you.

519
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,780
Here you go.

520
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,820
This is a...

521
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,830
This is expensive!

522
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,770
Myung-Pil, what does your
girlfriend do for a living?

523
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,950
I'll go and change myself
into my new clothes.

524
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,500
Did your article get turned down?

525
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:22,660
You must be too busy dating
to think of a new article.

526
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,850
Do you have any good ideas for me?

527
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,840
I don't have anything.

528
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,920
Myung-Pil, if you're in a hurry...
what about this?

529
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,850
The average life span
of Koreans is rising.

530
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,610
Marrying twice is a good idea?

531
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,980
Living the rest of your
life with a spouse...

532
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,910
...you found when you were
in your 20's is too long.

533
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,590
People make a lot of mistakes
with their first marriage...

534
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,700
...because they were
too young at the time.

535
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:52,890
The spouse you found in your 30's
or 40's is suitable to grow old with.

536
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:55,750
And to back up that trend...

537
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:58,880
...the divorce rate of couples
in their 30's and 40's is exploding.

538
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,680
There's also a huge market
for second marriages.

539
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:03,970
This makes sense.

540
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,900
That's a hot topic.

541
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,840
Let's work on it before
we submit it for an evaluation.

542
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,890
- Thanks.
- Your welcome.

543
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,970
The spouse you found in
your midlife is the right one for you.

544
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:21,760
Right, you know better now.

545
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,850
Living the rest of your life
with one spouse is boring.

546
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:30,720
That's why people cheat
on their spouses.

547
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,720
You're right!

548
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,640
People don't know
better in their 20's.

549
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,700
You need more time to
know who's right for you.

550
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,660
If I can pick a second spouse,
I want someone really young.

551
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:57,920
Myung-Pil, I think you sympathizing
too much with the need to marry twice.

552
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,890
(Guk-Hee)

553
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,960
I brought this here so people won't know you didn't come home last night.

554
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,960
You already changed into new clothes.

555
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,720
I haven't seen that before.

556
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,840
Did you get it from Tae-Ran?

557
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,600
You're Hur Myung-Pil.

558
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,720
I thought you placed your pride
above everything else.

559
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,950
Why are you letting her control you?

560
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,510
Take it back.

561
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,990
I'm busy!

562
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,770
Do you think she's controlling me?

563
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,590
Can't you tell that she's
helping me get my pride back?

564
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,510
It's me.

565
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,960
Come outside. Now!

566
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:49,630
Why are you doing this?

567
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,630
What did I ever do to you?

568
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,660
Why are you thinking of this
in terms of a dichotomy?

569
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,830
Don't think of it in terms of
an offender and a victim.

570
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:02,750
It's just that both Myung-Pil
and I were unhappy.

571
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,530
We were happy when we were together, and I wasn't lonely anymore.

572
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,740
That's it.

573
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:14,640
No one here is the
offender nor the victim.

574
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,970
You don't think I'm the victim?

575
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,760
If love found you...

576
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,940
...someone may be asking you the same question you're asking me right now.

577
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,780
It's not wrong to want
love and happiness.

578
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:30,580
No.

579
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,640
Do you think it's wrong for Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt to be in love?

580
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,640
They only fell in love a little late in life.

581
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,850
Are you saying that
you're Angelina Jolie?

582
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,870
I'm just saying.

583
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:52,700
I'm just telling you that we get along
and that we're happy together.

584
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,990
You can seek happiness
with a single man.

585
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:57,820
Why with a married man?

586
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,910
I thought you're the
new perfect wife men want.

587
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,890
True love has no boundaries.

588
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:13,600
I can see my young,
innocent self in his eyes.

589
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,720
He sees his young,
energetic self in my eyes.

590
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:21,530
Don't you know what pure love is?

591
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,700
Are you happy?

592
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,770
Shut up!

593
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,540
I'm too busy making a living
to think about happiness!

594
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,820
I'm too busy with raising my kids
and saving up for a house...

595
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,780
...to listen to your crap,
you immature child!

596
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,910
Stop calling me immature!

597
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,790
Do you think you're mature?
Just because you're married?

598
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,790
I can do a much better job taking
care of the house than you do!

599
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:44,830
You don't know anything!

600
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:48,580
Why, you...

601
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,910
What?

602
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,910
You don't have a right to do this to me!

603
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,640
Stop it!

604
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,780
Calm down! Calm down!

605
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,640
I won't ask you to pay for the
damages if you two calm down.

606
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,650
Stop it! Stop it, you two!

607
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,540
Tae-Ran, are you okay?

608
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,950
Let me take a look at you.

609
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,900
Myung-Pil...

610
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,580
I can't believe she did this to you!

611
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,710
- She's going to get it!
- Don't go!

612
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,660
Stay with me.

613
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,710
I'm scared.

614
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,850
I don't want to be alone anymore.

615
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,590
You didn't do anything wrong.

616
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:30,580
The only thing you did was to love me.

617
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,850
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

618
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,630
Look at me.

619
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,710
I'm okay.

620
00:52:40,710 --> 00:52:42,950
No, you're not!

621
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,550
It's you I'm worried about.

622
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:51,940
Can you live with Guk-Hee
for the rest of your life?

623
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,700
Remember when you told me
that you can't live without me?

624
00:52:57,700 --> 00:52:59,560
Same here.

625
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:02,600
I can't live without you either.

626
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,570
Tae-Ran.

627
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,810
Tae-Ran!

628
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:12,970
We can talk at home.

629
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:16,810
I want a divorce.

630
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,900
I can't live with you anymore.

631
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,570
Even if we get through this crisis...

632
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,730
...how are we going to make it
though the years to come?

633
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,880
What'll happen when I'm forty or fifty?

634
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,880
I'll eventually ask for a divorce again.

635
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,740
Let's get divorced.

636
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,880
Honey!

637
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:50,650
I'm not happy when I'm with you.

638
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:56,580
I always thought something was missing, but I didn't exactly know what it was.

639
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:03,550
I told myself to just
get by and grow older.

640
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,680
But things are different now.

641
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,520
I now know there's another
way to be happy.

642
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:19,780
I can't live with you after knowing
that I can take that road.

643
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,600
I can't go on like this anymore.

644
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:26,840
Let's get a divorce.

645
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,680
I mean it.

646
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:32,870
Honey, is it because Tae-Ran got hurt?

647
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,990
It wasn't me.

648
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,970
She scratched herself
with her own bracelet.

649
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,620
She pulled my hair.

650
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:38,940
I got hurt too, Honey.

651
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,670
You misunderstood.

652
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,620
Guk-Hee, please try to understand me.

653
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,750
I want to live with Tae-Ran.

654
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,580
I mean it.

655
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:00,800
She can give me the life
and the future I want.

656
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,920
I don't feel powerless
when I'm with Tae-Ran.

657
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,780
I feel like I can conquer this world.

658
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,560
I feel like I'm back to my young self.

659
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:14,600
I can't like with you like this anymore.

660
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,670
Please grant me a divorce.

661
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:22,640
Honey, Honey, Honey...

662
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,660
Honey, please don't ask
me for a divorce.

663
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,580
Anything but that! No!

664
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,670
I'll try harder!

665
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,610
Please?

666
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:32,550
Where are you going?

667
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,750
Please don't go!

668
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,650
Nothing will change if I stay!

669
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,620
Do you want to live with me like this?

670
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,870
We won't get anywhere together.

671
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,700
I'll try harder.

672
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:48,830
We'll soon buy a house, and
I'll be nicer to the kids.

673
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,610
I'll be nicer to you too.

674
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,600
I'll be nicer to your mom too.

675
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:54,920
Honey!

676
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,110
How? With what?

677
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,830
Can you be an acupuncturist
like Mr. Yeom's wife?

678
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:03,890
We don't love each other anymore,
and there's no way out!

679
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:06,780
We have nothing to look forward to!

680
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,710
Let me go!

681
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:31,980
What am I going to do?

682
00:57:35,850 --> 00:58:46,670

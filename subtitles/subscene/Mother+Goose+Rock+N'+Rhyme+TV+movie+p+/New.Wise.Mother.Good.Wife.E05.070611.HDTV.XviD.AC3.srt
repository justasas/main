1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,160
I can't live with you like this anymore.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:13,140
Please grant me a divorce.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:15,610
Honey, Honey, Honey...

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,540
Honey, please don't
ask me for a divorce.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,290
Anything but that! No!

6
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,220
I'll try harder!

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,430
Please?

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,350
Where are you going?

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,420
Please don't go!

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,560
Nothing will change if I stay!

11
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,350
I'll try harder.

12
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,500
We'll soon buy a house,
and I'll be nicer to the kids.

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,250
I'll be nicer to you too.

14
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,160
I'll be nicer to your mom too.

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,560
Honey!

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,190
How? With what?

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,550
Can you be an acupuncturist
like Mr. Yeom's wife?

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,590
We don't love each other anymore,
and there's no way out!

19
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,140
We have nothing to look forward to!

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,540
Let me go!

21
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,190
Honey...

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,570
Acupuncturist? You?
An acupuncturist?

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,310
Yeah, do you know
anything about it?

24
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,200
Do you have any acupuncturist friends?

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,330
I heard it's easier to
become one overseas.

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,470
I heard there's a program shorter
than 6-years at an institute.

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,210
Tell me if you know anything about it.

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,220
Stop it, Guk-Hee!

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,410
Is becoming an acupuncturist
what you really want?

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,590
Would that change your life?

31
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,280
Why do you take your friend's side
when you don't side with yourself?

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,200
Have you ever thought
about what you want?

33
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,150
Is this what you really want?

34
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,150
- Episode 5 -

35
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,600
I already said everything
I wanted to say last night.

36
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,250
Then just hear me out this time.

37
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,480
Now I know why...

38
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,160
I don't have time to take
my wisdom tooth out...

39
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,390
Why I don't have time
to get a surgery for varix...

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,420
Why it's my fault that
we couldn't buy a house...

41
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,350
Why I'm devoted to my in-laws when I don't even attend my mom's memorial...

42
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,500
Why I'm trying to be an acupuncturist...

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,600
...when you're the one
who cheated on me.

44
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,360
Now I know where
everything went wrong.

45
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,370
The problem is, I'm always
the one who's doing something.

46
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,140
I can't take it anymore.

47
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,320
I won't do it.

48
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,210
If this keeps up...

49
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,550
...I'll work myself to death
to make more money...

50
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,560
...even after I become an acupuncturist.

51
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,260
One of these days,
I might have a third child.

52
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,600
If our kids don't get into
a top-notch university...

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,500
...then it'll be my fault as well.

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,540
I won't get to take my wisdom
teeth out even when I turn fifty.

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,510
Gyung Guk-Hee won't be around anymore...only a staggering woman.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,140
The kind of a woman you mistreat
and Tae-Ran looks down on.

57
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,260
So?

58
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,280
Now it's your turn to put some effort.

59
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,300
I worked to build this family, and
you're the one who's tearing it apart.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,260
You're the one who should
apologize and try harder.

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,330
No more cheating in my house.

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,440
If you do, you can't live
in our house anymore.

63
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,160
Our house? My house?

64
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,390
You're wrong.

65
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:28,470
It's my house.

66
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,310
We're living in that house
with the money I earned.

67
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,570
The kids?

68
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,300
We raised them with my money.

69
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,590
What did you do for us?

70
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,460
I think the money you
earned from the market...

71
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,170
...is enough to cover a refrigerator.

72
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:53,560
If you put it this way, you don't
own anything in that house.

73
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,320
I'm the one who worked
like a dog to earn money.

74
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:03,280
Stop trying to corner me.

75
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,210
I want a divorce.

76
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,340
I don't have anything else to say.

77
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,570
Do you think you'll be
happy with Tae-Ran?

78
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,390
Fine then.
Be my guest.

79
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,240
I'll get out.

80
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,530
I'll get out of that house...
since I only paid for a refrigerator.

81
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,470
Do whatever you want.

82
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,140
Let's go inside.

83
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,520
What's with the bag and the kids?

84
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,490
What happened?

85
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,270
I want to live here.

86
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,160
Please let me live here.

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,630
Mom...

88
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,420
Let's stay here for now.

89
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,330
Here? You want to live here?

90
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,140
I never stopped Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk from doing anything they wanted to do.

91
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,530
If you stop people from doing
what they want to do...

92
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,360
...it'll only make them
want to do it more.

93
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,360
So I told him to do
whatever he wants.

94
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,540
So you told him to live with her?

95
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,210
If that's what he wants,
then that's what I'll let him do.

96
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,370
And?

97
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,370
I'll have to wait.

98
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,230
After that, I'll put
everything back to its place.

99
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,200
I'll get my place back.

100
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,440
What if you don't get it back?

101
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,160
What if it doesn't work out?

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,390
Then I won't have any choice.

103
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,570
But things aren't much
different now either.

104
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,370
My husband wants a divorce.

105
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,390
What else can I do?

106
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,140
Nothing...except letting
him step all over you.

107
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,440
My last chance
is to let him live with her.

108
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,540
Even if we separate,
I'll decide when that'll be.

109
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:55,340
Even if we get a divorce,
I'll give it to him when I want to.

110
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,550
Hide and seek?

111
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,330
Who's it?

112
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,620
Dad.

113
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,550
We're going to give Dad
a hard time until he gives up.

114
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,550
I'm going to hide from Dad.

115
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,220
Can you hide with me?

116
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,580
Yes!

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,620
I'm good at playing hide and seek.

118
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,460
I won't let Dad find us.

119
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,520
When Dad says, 'I give up!'
that's when we go home!

120
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,170
Until then...

121
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:41,210
Fight on!

122
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Kids!

123
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,590
I made ddukboki for you guys!

124
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,200
Thank you!

125
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,350
Enjoy.

126
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,460
Your kids are so lucky.

127
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,170
My mom beat my dad up
in front of my eyes.

128
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,260
Okay.

129
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,170
Remember the place
we had sushi last time?

130
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,140
It's next to the Sokcho beach.

131
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,630
See you there by nine.

132
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,560
Dress up.

133
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,370
I miss you.

134
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,310
I have to use the restroom.

135
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,420
Is this the woman?

136
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,610
Is this the best you can do?

137
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,430
You never told me about your debt.

138
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,350
You're having an affair.

139
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,330
You didn't run a construction
company like you told me you did.

140
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:13,360
There wasn't an ounce of
truth in anything you said!

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,570
What?

142
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,480
Why, I ought to...

143
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,560
What are you doing?

144
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,350
Let go of me!

145
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:27,140
Are you crazy?

146
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,410
Yun-Shil...

147
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,470
What's wrong?

148
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,320
What's bothering you?

149
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,380
The man who attacked me that night...

150
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:14,340
I don't know who...why...
or what happened.

151
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:30,540
My dad thought his life was over when my mom passed away when I was five.

152
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:36,330
But as I grew up, he told me...

153
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,550
'Life begins right when you
think everything's over.'

154
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,350
That's what he believed in.

155
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,140
Let's take this one step
at a time...together.

156
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,330
'Go ahead.'

157
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,380
'I'll stay out of your life. Go ahead.'

158
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,470
What was that about?

159
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,370
She's challenging me.

160
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,600
She doesn't think I can pull through.

161
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,230
She thinks we'll put an end
to this one of these days.

162
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,580
And?

163
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,220
Tae-Ran, I better go home
and hear what she wants to do.

164
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,400
Let's go.

165
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,550
Eun-Suk! Gi-Suk!

166
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,220
So? Where are you right now?

167
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,320
And the kids?

168
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,430
They're with me.

169
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,480
Don't worry, they're doing fine.

170
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,450
Let's get a divorce.

171
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,550
That'll take care of everything.

172
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,300
I'm not getting a divorce.

173
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,140
Then what?

174
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,360
I'll think about it if you still
like her after you live with her.

175
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,160
When will that be?

176
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,210
I don't know.

177
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,330
We'll see.

178
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,270
Hello? Hello?

179
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,600
Why are you outside?

180
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,610
I was on the phone.

181
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,240
What about you?

182
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,270
I was on the phone with my parents.

183
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,630
They were going to move
back to Korea this month...

184
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,570
...but they have to stay
longer in Germany.

185
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,450
I already put my place up for rent...

186
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,230
...so I can move in with my parents
when they come back.

187
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,230
What are you going to do?

188
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,230
Mom!

189
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,510
Yes? What's wrong?

190
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,190
Why are you guys up?

191
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,420
They got up in the middle of the night.

192
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,400
They were looking for you.

193
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,520
These two princes can't sleep
because they woke up.

194
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,440
This big man can't sleep
because he's lonely.

195
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,190
And now you're up too.

196
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,360
Three men and two women
will be up tonight.

197
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,490
Go to that side.

198
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,160
You too.

199
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,360
I'll show you an exercise
you can do to go to sleep.

200
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,390
<i> Repeat after me.</i>

201
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,490
<i> Repeat after me.</i>

202
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,170
<i> Repeat after me.</i>

203
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,170
<i> Wow, this is fun!</i>

204
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,270
<i> Repeat after me. </i>

205
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,200
Guk-Hee!

206
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,540
Guk-hee! Why didn't you wake me up?

207
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
Guk-Hee!

208
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
My socks...

209
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,200
They're all wet!

210
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,440
Why are my socks all wet?

211
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,380
I'm sure we had another hair dryer.

212
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,450
Where's the hair dryer?

213
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,470
Close this broken valve
before you go to bed.

214
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,310
If you don't, the bathroom
will be flooded in the morning.

215
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,610
Why won't you listen to me?

216
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,200
Hello?

217
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,250
Hey you!

218
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,450
None of the socks
and towels are dry!

219
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,630
Where's the hair dryer?

220
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,280
It's in the master bedroom.

221
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,490
No, the other one!

222
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,420
Keep looking.

223
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,150
Where is it?

224
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,530
Don't yell at me.

225
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,300
Oh, I left it in the multi-purpose room.

226
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,500
I put it in the container behind the door.

227
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,550
Gyung Guk-Hee!

228
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,390
Th...Thief!

229
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,350
Good morning.

230
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,230
Oh, hi.

231
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,480
Off to work?

232
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,350
Yes.

233
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,180
Be careful.

234
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,150
Is this all the money I have?

235
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,460
All your accounts are in your husband's name except for this one.

236
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,540
Oh, well.

237
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,210
I'll take $180.

238
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,310
Okay.

239
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,490
Fill this out, please.

240
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,370
Do you know who he is?

241
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,580
Yes, I know him very well.

242
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,360
What's that smell?

243
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,170
My husband doesn't like the smell
of fish, so I'm drying them here.

244
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,210
I'll give you some after they're dried.

245
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:26,270
I hate the smell of fish!

246
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,620
What now?

247
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,560
Hey!

248
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,280
Oh, no!

249
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,540
I was going to tell you
to be careful of the water gun.

250
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,330
Too late.

251
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,490
This is my house!

252
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,580
I enjoyed the peace
and tranquility here!

253
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,520
What the heck is going on?

254
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,360
Are you guys trying
to make me go postal?

255
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I hate it! I hate it!

256
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,460
What do you take me for?

257
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,550
I'm Sniff!

258
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,620
I told you that I'll be standing
in front of your house.

259
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,630
Get your butt over here!

260
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,140
How much is this?

261
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,470
That'll be $1.

262
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,460
Bottoms up.

263
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,350
Cheer up!

264
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,220
This won't make me feel better.

265
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,540
I need chicken soup.

266
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,450
I'll buy you that later.

267
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,210
Thanks.

268
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,500
Oh yeah, I heard something
strange at the bank.

269
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,150
Let me go!

270
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,540
I don't have anything to talk about!

271
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,240
Fine, we'll talk on the way!

272
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,420
I'll just plop on the floor.

273
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,600
Wait! Why won't you trust me?

274
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,510
Why would I trust you?

275
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:06,450
How can anyone trust someone
who wants to kill his wife?

276
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,450
I'm not stupid.

277
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,470
No, just hear me out.

278
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,430
There's nothing to hear.

279
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:24,500
You were trying to run off with
your wife's life insurance, right?

280
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,330
Out of my way.

281
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,480
White pants got $1 million
from the insurance company.

282
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,570
$1 mil? Why him?

283
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,470
He signed up for an insurance policy Yun-Shil's name two months ago.

284
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,290
The man who tried to kill me
is with my husband.

285
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,270
My husband tried to kill me.

286
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:13,220
Let's report white pants to the police.

287
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,180
Everything will be taken care of...

288
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,530
...once you show up
and tell them what happened.

289
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,620
What if they don't believe us
like they did last time?

290
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,580
Yun-Shil's alive right now.

291
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,400
We don't have any proof.

292
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,550
All we have is her testimony.

293
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,290
What are we supposed to do then?

294
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,620
We need undeniable evidence.

295
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,520
Oh, I know!

296
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,540
A security camera!

297
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,530
I'm sure he has something in the safe.

298
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,400
He never told me his password.

299
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,220
Still, give these numbers a try.

300
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,630
3258... 7564...

301
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,430
What happened?

302
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,190
It wasn't Su-Duk!

303
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,270
The only thing I did was touch that...

304
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,140
What are we going to do?

305
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,140
The kids are coming!

306
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,200
The kids?

307
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,180
What are we going to do?

308
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,150
The veranda! The veranda!

309
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,190
What are you doing right now?

310
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,310
I'm Min Seung-Gi,
a promising young officer.

311
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,310
I have great, shocking news for you!

312
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,610
What? They broke in where?

313
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,620
Tell me what happened!

314
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,630
I'm going to ask you this one more time.

315
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,220
Why did you go inside that house?

316
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:00,380
Geez...

317
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,520
Hello?

318
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,190
Hey, it's me!

319
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,540
What now?

320
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,400
Excuse me, I have a call.

321
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,560
I'm in front of your house right now.

322
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:26,220
I'm going to plop down here
until you pay me for killing your wife!

323
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,610
What? Now?

324
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
Hey! Hey!

325
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Mr. Kim Jo-Han?

326
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,200
Yes?

327
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,180
Let's go to your house.

328
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,440
What? Why?

329
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,460
To check if anything's missing.

330
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,160
No need to do that.

331
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,570
My kids called and told me
that they invited these people over.

332
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,400
They wanted to give them
a few pictures of their mother...

333
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,240
...because they're her friends.

334
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,360
My kids asked you to come, right?

335
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,390
Yes, that's right.

336
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,610
We didn't do anything wrong.

337
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,340
Good morning.

338
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,190
Tae-Ran?

339
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,370
What happened?

340
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,580
When did you get here?

341
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:37,360
You must really be tired nowadays.

342
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,180
I don't think you were
that drunk last night.

343
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,260
I brought you home last night.

344
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,230
Come on.

345
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,160
Enjoy your breakfast
before you go to work.

346
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,440
Try it.

347
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,410
Okay...

348
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,300
Is it good?

349
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,540
It's good!

350
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,280
Can I get a cup of water?

351
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:29,310
I've always dreamed of picking my husband's necktie as he's off to work.

352
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,470
Do you know what
I've always dreamed of?

353
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,480
To have a great woman
like you take care of me.

354
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,270
This is my dream come true.

355
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,470
When I first started going out with you,
I never knew we'd end up here.

356
00:30:53,370 --> 00:31:00,370
At first, I wanted someone
I couldn't have a long time ago.

357
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,570
But now I know what I really want.

358
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:13,240
I'm tired of dating younger men, teaching them how to date...

359
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,210
...and then break up right
before getting married.

360
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:26,270
I know that it'll be hard and painful
for you to break your family...

361
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,200
I'm sure of this.

362
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,370
I won't quit in the middle
like Guk-Hee thinks.

363
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:42,200
I want to be your wife, officially.

364
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,280
Guk-Hee!

365
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,260
Guk-Hee!

366
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,330
Good morning.

367
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,320
Tae-Ran?

368
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,610
Why were you in that room?

369
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,260
Where's Guk-Hee?

370
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,310
Mother, let me explain.

371
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,310
Guk-Hee?

372
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,350
Come in.

373
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,220
The door's unlocked.

374
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,620
Good morning.

375
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:25,350
I couldn't sleep a wink last night because I was afraid of burglars.

376
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,210
But then again,
the people in this family...

377
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:33,410
...are the husband and
mother-in-law of the burglar.

378
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,350
What?

379
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,520
I can't live with your family anymore.

380
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,440
Please move out.

381
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,200
What?

382
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,480
We need to talk.

383
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,550
Follow me.

384
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,340
These are the divorce papers.

385
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,610
I already stamped my seal on it.

386
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,630
It's your turn now.

387
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,350
Why would I give you a divorce for?

388
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,340
Guess what?

389
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,420
Things are turning out
the way you wanted it to.

390
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,170
It's driving me crazy.

391
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,360
My life is a mess, both
at work and at home.

392
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:45,250
That's probably what you wanted,
but one thing's sure now.

393
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,330
I can't live with you.

394
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,500
You can live with the women
with botox on their brains.

395
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,560
I'll live with Tae-Ran.

396
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,250
You can be robbers or burglars
with them if you want.

397
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,360
Let's live with the people
we want to live with.

398
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:06,340
Fine! Live with her!

399
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,380
I don't have a problem with that.

400
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,190
Did you get botox
on your brains again?

401
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,420
I can't live with another woman
without getting divorced!

402
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:18,340
You know how much
I hate being wishy-washy!

403
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:25,380
Let's put an end to this
and get on with our lives.

404
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,240
Thanks, I needed some paper towel.

405
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,290
Hey!

406
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,440
I have to go.

407
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,150
Bye.

408
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,340
Hello?

409
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,560
Hello.

410
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:21,200
I brought Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk home.

411
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,310
What?

412
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,590
Don't you know that it's the women
who drive men to do what they're doing?

413
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,280
Can't you do anything right?

414
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,160
No wonder Myung-Pil
finds peace elsewhere.

415
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,420
Do I have to do everything for you?

416
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,410
Anyways, don't ever get a divorce.

417
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:48,230
The kids are here.

418
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,610
Just do as I say, okay?

419
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,240
Mom, don't let him find you!

420
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,180
I see.

421
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,630
Okay, Mom.

422
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,320
What did your mom say?

423
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:27,620
She brought the kids home.

424
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,400
She's uncomfortable with
a situation like this.

425
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,170
She's an old woman.

426
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,590
Don't worry about it.

427
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,470
I'll take care of everything.

428
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,440
Why don't we eat at home?

429
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,610
I doubt your mom
had a good dinner.

430
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,170
Let's get food to go and eat home
with your mom and the kids.

431
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,390
Are you thinking about your kids?

432
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,400
They're nearby.

433
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,290
They'll be fine.

434
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,310
I'm worried.

435
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,400
I feel as though things
will get worse.

436
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,290
I believed that
I won't lose everything...

437
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,200
...but I feel as though
I might lose everything.

438
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:03,230
Grandma...Grandma...

439
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,160
Eun-Suk!

440
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,350
Why are you up?

441
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,250
Gi-Suk is acting weird.

442
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,620
Why?

443
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,630
What's wrong, Gi-Suk?

444
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,200
Gi-Suk! Do you have indigestion?

445
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,310
I'm home.

446
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,380
What's wrong with him?

447
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,600
Do you have a stomachache?

448
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,630
Let me take a look?

449
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,360
Are you okay?

450
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,190
Look how much he's sweating!

451
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,260
I better take him to the hospital!

452
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,400
Wait, the director of
Yeonil Hospital lives nearby.

453
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,450
He's a good friend of mine.

454
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,500
Do something! Now!

455
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,580
Hello? This is Tae-Ran.

456
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,350
He has mesenteric lymphadenitis.

457
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,580
You can say that his intestine
came down with a cold.

458
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,600
- What?
- I gave him medications.

459
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,620
Just rub his stomach.

460
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,540
He'll be fine in the morning.

461
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:11,630
Does that mean he doesn't
have to go to the hospital?

462
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,410
He'll be fine once
the fever goes down.

463
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,260
What a relief!

464
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,250
Gi-Suk is okay now!

465
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,520
By the way, he has hernia.

466
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,540
Hernia?

467
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,280
Gi-Suk has hernia?

468
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,350
Since it only shows up
when he's breathing...

469
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,170
...his parents might've overlooked it.

470
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,360
It's a very simple procedure
at an early stage.

471
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,580
Come to the hospital tomorrow.

472
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:43,630
We wouldn't have known
if it wasn't for you.

473
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,570
If you find it at an early stage,
we can treat it before it starts hurting.

474
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,480
Thank you, Doctor.

475
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,290
Thank you.

476
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,620
You should thank Tae-Ran instead.

477
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,380
Call me up if you need more help.

478
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,570
Thanks.

479
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:04,280
I still owe you a big one for
helping me write my paper last time.

480
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,590
I better get going now.

481
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,630
Goodbye.

482
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,610
Stay a little longer.

483
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,580
This scared you too.

484
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,160
It's too late in the night,
and I'm sure you're both tired.

485
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,440
You should rest.

486
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:23,350
I'll take you home.

487
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,320
Your mother's by herself.

488
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,380
I can go with the doctor.

489
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,600
Goodnight.

490
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,590
See you later.

491
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,460
So...what are you trying to do?

492
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Are you going to marry Tae-Ran?

493
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,440
That's what I want to do.

494
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,400
What?

495
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:15,230
How can you think about
leaving your wife?

496
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,210
No way!

497
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,380
A lot of people get divorced nowadays.

498
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,310
Things have changed.

499
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,320
It's okay to meet new partners
after getting a divorce...

500
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,160
...unlike like your generation.

501
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,270
Even if I live to be my father's age,
I still have 40 more years left.

502
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:38,320
Remember how unhappy
your marriage was?

503
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,270
Do you want me to be unhappy
for the next 40 years too?

504
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:50,280
But still...what about the kids?

505
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,360
The kids need their mother!

506
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,240
You saw how great Tae-Ran is.

507
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,220
The kids will be brought up differently than they would be under Guk-Hee.

508
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,200
But I think it's for the best.

509
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:21,330
I put your school supplies in this bag.

510
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,300
Color your board nice and pretty, okay?

511
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,170
- Dad didn't find you yet, right?
- Okay.

512
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:36,350
Gi-Suk, did you ever see me lose in your preschool parent-child competition?

513
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,420
I never lose!

514
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:46,150
You can come over to see me whenever you want after telling Grandma.

515
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,240
What about Dad?

516
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,480
Not Dad.

517
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,140
Where's Grandma?

518
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,350
There she is!

519
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,280
Hi...

520
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,190
Hello?

521
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,460
It's me.

522
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:47,480
My mom decided to go along
with my decision.

523
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,620
Things aren't going the way
you want them to be.

524
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,390
I want a divorce.

525
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,410
Stamp that seal.

526
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:05,180
Just because your mother changed her mind doesn't mean I changed mine.

527
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,620
I see how it is.

528
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,520
Fine then.

529
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,240
I don't know what you want to find out...

530
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,270
...but let's do it until you
find out what you need to.

531
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,470
You won't regret it, right?

532
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:23,460
No.

533
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,420
Here.

534
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:38,600
You want a divorce?

535
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,250
No, Honey!

536
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,420
Don't leave Su-Duk!

537
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,370
Take a look at it!

538
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,160
A dieting trip?

539
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,430
Do you know how much
weight you gained...

540
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,450
...from hanging out
in that woman's house?

541
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:03,330
I told you to stay at home
and go on a diet!

542
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:08,360
Now that the kids are in a boarding school, you should go on a dieting trip.

543
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,390
No, Honey.

544
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,160
Anything but that.

545
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,290
You know how I hate seeing
women flock together in groups!

546
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,230
Stop going to that house!
And stop eating!

547
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:23,260
This dieting trip is your only option!

548
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,180
I think it's him!

549
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,560
Yes, it's him!

550
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,440
He's the one who attacked me!

551
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,260
Are you sure?

552
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,310
Yes! We got him in the camera!

553
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:46,470
Let me see.

554
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,310
Can we zoom in?

555
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:53,140
Can you please be quiet?

556
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:59,590
Come on, we found the man
who attacked Yun-Shil.

557
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,600
See?

558
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,250
He's the man who knocked
Yun-Shil unconscious.

559
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:08,320
We got the two of them on tape.

560
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,560
We did it!

561
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,490
You're right.

562
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:14,400
He's the white pants, and...

563
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,290
It's Sniff!

564
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,450
Sniff?

565
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,230
He's my husband...

566
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:27,240
Husband?
The man you divorced?

567
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:29,160
No, I didn't get a divorce.

568
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,530
I couldn't.

569
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:34,310
What am I going to do?

570
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:39,350
Does that mean Jang-Mi's
husband attacked Yun-Shil?

571
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:41,170
What's going on?

572
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:44,440
Do you know what I went through
to stay away from my husband?

573
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,550
Why is he here?

574
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,500
This is all your fault!

575
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,460
You brought him here!

576
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,420
Get out! Get out! Get out!

577
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,270
What are you doing?

578
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,230
Jang-Mi...

579
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,370
Get out! Get out!

580
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,400
I know where you're coming from, but...

581
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,510
Get out! Get out!

582
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,570
Jang-Mi, let's talk.

583
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,310
Where's Yun-Shil?

584
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,150
Yun-Shil!

585
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:23,500
Yun-shil! Yun-Shil, where are you?

586
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,350
Yun-Shil!

587
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,340
Where is she?

588
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,150
- Yun-Shil, where are you?
- Yun-shil, where are you?

589
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:39,230
Yun-Shil!

590
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,430
Did you find her?

591
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,350
No.

592
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,250
She's not up there either.

593
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,550
- Let's go this way.
- Okay.

594
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,430
Yun-Shil!

595
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:50,140
Yun-Shil!

596
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,460
No, that's dangerous!

597
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,320
Yun-Shil!

598
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,430
Yun-Shil!

599
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,320
I have to move out of here.

600
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,600
I need to get out of here
as soon as I can.

601
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,370
What seems to be the matter?

602
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,170
That's none of your business.

603
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,420
I need to get out of here, fast.

604
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:45,300
I can tell you're in an emergency.

605
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:47,500
Look at your face!

606
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,240
You're sweating.

607
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:57,550
I don't know what the matter is,
but you can talk to me about it.

608
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:03,190
What are you doing? Stop it!

609
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,450
Stop it!

610
00:49:05,450 --> 00:49:07,190
Honey!

611
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,360
Nam Jang-Mi!

612
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,430
Why, you...

613
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,150
I knew it would be you!

614
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,620
Why, I ought to...

615
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,470
The both of you! Get over here!
Come here!

616
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,610
No, it's not what you think it is...

617
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,260
Are you okay?

618
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,460
Yes...

619
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,250
Be strong, Yun-Shil.

620
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:30,380
We're here for you.

621
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,400
Let's drive out Nam Jang-Mi,
the evil divorcee!

622
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,550
Hang on.

623
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,380
It's a misunderstanding.

624
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,320
Everyone!

625
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,300
Stop it!

626
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,620
You've gone too far!

627
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,160
They're going to get it!

628
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,370
What's that noise?

629
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,350
Calm down!

630
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,630
Hey! Stop right here!

631
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,600
Who do they think they are?

632
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,620
Just because we're not homeowners doesn't mean they can look down on us!

633
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,230
Oh, no...

634
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,590
You have a scar
on your pretty face.

635
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,210
I'll get more if Sniff finds me.

636
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,390
We're all good people...

637
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:10,490
...but how can they do this to us
just because we're different.

638
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,270
You're right.

639
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,340
Why do they judge us
and treat us like weirdoes...

640
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,200
...without getting the facts straight?

641
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,290
Jang-Mi is not boy crazy.

642
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:30,480
If a man touches her, she'd say,
'I hate it when a stranger touches me!

643
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,510
The same goes for you.

644
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:37,450
You're too timid to steal from anyone.

645
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:41,430
This makes me mad. Really mad.

646
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,360
They're so selfish!

647
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,290
Why are you laughing?

648
00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,270
What's so funny?

649
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,450
Take a look at yourselves.

650
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:04,540
Look at your hair!

651
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,380
How about me?

652
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:18,500
Especially you.

653
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:24,280
You were awesome when you slammed that megaphone on the floor.

654
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,320
That felt great.

655
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:30,240
What about me?

656
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:37,560
Su-duk...You were really cute, especially when you threw that shoe at her.

657
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,550
You're praising yourselves.

658
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,400
Maybe I won't move out.

659
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,300
What about your husband?

660
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,620
I'm scared of him,
but I'm not alone.

661
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,290
As long as you're here with me.

662
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,400
Me too. I'll stay too.

663
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,510
I'll be here with you too.

664
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:14,260
My husband never listens to me.

665
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,230
He placed our kids
in the boarding house...

666
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,210
...even though my kids
and I were against it.

667
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,160
My kids aren't even home anymore.

668
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,410
I'll stay with you guys.

669
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,610
What about the dieting trip?

670
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:32,440
Why would I want to do that for?

671
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,560
He can go instead
if he wants to be skinny.

672
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,620
Ow, ow...I'm aching all over.

673
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,320
Really?

674
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,620
Looks sexy..

675
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,370
Maybe I should start
putting my hair up too.

676
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:56,190
Ouch...

677
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,170
I think you overstrained yourself.

678
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,610
Maybe you really need
that chicken soup.

679
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,300
Yes, I think so too.

680
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,500
You should address me with honorifics.

681
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,140
I'm five years older than you.

682
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,580
Once a friend, always a friend.

683
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,380
That's my motto.

684
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,470
Why do you want to be my friend?

685
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:18,430
Do you like this chaos?

686
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,240
Yes, I do.

687
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,500
Where else can I experience
something so spectacular at my age?

688
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:27,410
I think I'll be bored
if I stop coming here.

689
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,390
What's wrong?

690
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,410
Nothing.

691
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,250
Hello?

692
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,320
It's me, Tae-Ran.

693
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,420
Do you want to meet up today?

694
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,180
Welcome.

695
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:05,470
A woman is expecting me.

696
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,320
She said she'll be here waiting.

697
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,260
We don't have any tables
with just one female guest.

698
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:11,510
Can you get me a seat?

699
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,530
Sure, right his way.

700
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,270
You should have some too.

701
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:25,150
Okay.

702
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,560
This is so good.

703
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,330
What do you think? Do you like it?

704
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,550
Yes, but I wish this was spicier.

705
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,420
I'll get some hot sauce.

706
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,250
Excuse me!

707
00:55:51,190 --> 00:55:53,280
Oh, my gosh!

708
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,170
No, stay seated.

709
00:56:03,370 --> 00:56:05,300
Guk-Hee!

710
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,400
Was this your plan?

711
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,290
You told me not to regret it.

712
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:14,270
Is this what you were thinking?

713
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,360
It was supposed to be just
you, me, and Tae-Ran.

714
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:22,200
The kids and my mother
somehow ended up coming.

715
00:56:25,350 --> 00:56:26,230
See?

716
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,170
This hurts.

717
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,530
Everyone will get hurt.

718
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:31,620
We know where this is leading to.

719
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,630
Why are you making
it hard on everyone?

720
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:39,440
Stamp your seal.

721
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,310
Do it!

722
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,300
Stamp your seal!

723
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,440
Let's not hurt ourselves anymore.

724
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,540
I see.

725
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:58,320
Is that what you really want?

726
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,230
Fine, I'll do it!

727
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,170
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

728
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,210
Have fun!

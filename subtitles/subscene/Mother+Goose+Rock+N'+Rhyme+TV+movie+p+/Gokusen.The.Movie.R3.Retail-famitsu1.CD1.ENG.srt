00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:44,727
"Narita International Airport"

2
00:01:21,903 --> 00:01:25,168
On its way from Hong Kong to Tokyo,

3
00:01:25,339 --> 00:01:27,364
First Airline flight 816

4
00:01:27,508 --> 00:01:31,672
was hijacked before landing in Narita Airport.

5
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:36,350
No demand except for a ramp
has been made by the hijackers...

6
00:01:36,517 --> 00:01:39,315
They may be armed with guns.

7
00:01:39,487 --> 00:01:42,217
The passengers' safety is of the greatest concern.

8
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,614
What's their demand?

9
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,728
20 million dollars and a getaway plane.

10
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,156
We won't accept.

11
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:54,596
Should we send in the SWAT team?

12
00:01:54,735 --> 00:02:00,139
Not yet. We'll use them as our last resort.

13
00:02:01,042 --> 00:02:03,101
They're taking too long.

14
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:06,673
We'll wait 5 more minutes.

15
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,914
Stop screwing with us!

16
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:15,217
Our vacation abroad...

17
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:18,757
It was a bad idea.

18
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,490
At any rate...

19
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:27,426
How can she stay asleep?

20
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,570
I slept so well.

21
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:37,405
Are we landing soon?

22
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:41,945
Keep your voice down.

23
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,787
Quiet!

24
00:02:48,956 --> 00:02:50,184
Yes.

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,621
Hijack?

26
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,794
When did this happen?

27
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:02,127
Can I have some water?

28
00:03:02,236 --> 00:03:05,103
Shut your mouth, hag!

29
00:03:06,107 --> 00:03:07,904
Hag?

30
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:09,938
What's that look?

31
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,678
Sit still and behave, geezer.

32
00:03:17,218 --> 00:03:19,846
Unforgivable.

33
00:03:21,555 --> 00:03:24,217
You all behave.

34
00:03:24,358 --> 00:03:25,655
Miss Yamaguchi!

35
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:30,092
They're people who deserve respect

36
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:33,256
for their decades of hard work.

37
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:35,458
How dare you dis them.

38
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,428
What'd you say?

39
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:42,436
Whatever it is you want,

40
00:03:42,777 --> 00:03:46,770
face the sun and

41
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:49,379
say it with pride and dignity.

42
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:50,848
Stop blabbering!

43
00:03:59,093 --> 00:04:00,788
Move in!

44
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,489
There was a gunshot.

45
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,697
The hijackers did have guns.

46
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:46,701
Forgive us!

47
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,410
Huh?

48
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:08,585
Miss Yamaguchi?

49
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:12,864
- What?
- Look!

50
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,159
You're kidding!

51
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,070
Miss Yamaguchi?!

52
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,399
Yankumi...

53
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:22,136
My Lady...

54
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:23,504
Kumiko...

55
00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,512
My Lady's in trouble!

56
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:28,614
You guys, let's go!

57
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,456
We're going.

58
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:43,126
It's over.

59
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,000
No... I'm not the criminal.

60
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:52,432
I'm straight.

61
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,873
Straight?

62
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,841
Straight?

63
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:05,885
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi.

64
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,146
A teacher at Akado High School.

65
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,220
I teach math.

66
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,917
My nickname is Yankumi.

67
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:16,619
By the way, I'm single.

68
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:54,195
GOKUSEN THE MOVIE

69
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,704
"The Oedo Family"

70
00:07:01,809 --> 00:07:03,834
I'm glad you're okay.

71
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:07,342
It was reckless of you.

72
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:10,378
I'm sorry to worry you.

73
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,043
But we were impressed.

74
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:19,181
Guts and honor befitting
the 4th generation head.

75
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:21,893
You can take over any day.

76
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,696
My Lady!
No..."Lady Boss"!

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,298
Sounds nice.

78
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:37,869
You guys, follow my lead.

79
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:42,575
"The Oedo Family"

80
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,913
No way. I'm not taking over.

81
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:51,421
I bought souvenirs for you.

82
00:07:52,893 --> 00:07:56,226
You didn't have to do that.

83
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:07,697
Oops... They're at the airport.

84
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,917
Sorry.

85
00:08:24,425 --> 00:08:28,794
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi,
a high school teacher.

86
00:08:30,064 --> 00:08:32,464
I lost my parents at age 7

87
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:35,397
and was raised by my grandfather,
Ryuichiro Kuroda,

88
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,231
the 3rd generation head of the Oedo Family.

89
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,636
I've been a teacher for 7 years.

90
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:48,440
My students always happen
to be so-called delinquents.

91
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:52,276
But they taught me things.

92
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:57,116
Face them squarely and they'll do the same.

93
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:00,759
You can see eye to eye.

94
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:05,195
In 7 years, I've grown thanks to my students.

95
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:10,360
Good morning, Yankumi.

96
00:09:10,804 --> 00:09:12,101
Good morning, Kuma.

97
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:15,241
I saw you on the news yesterday.

98
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:19,344
No big deal. I wasn't afraid of them.

99
00:09:20,547 --> 00:09:22,708
You were cool.

100
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,474
No compliments.

101
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,515
It's embarrassing.

102
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:28,882
See ya.

103
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:43,336
"Hijackers surrender themselves"

104
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:47,096
"Hijackers arrested"

105
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:51,175
I didn't know this was your flight.

106
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:53,643
I was shocked when I saw the news.

107
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,008
Thank goodness you're safe.

108
00:09:55,182 --> 00:10:00,051
It was terrifying.
Miss Ayukawa is still in shock.

109
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:02,654
I'm gonna die...

110
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:04,519
A hijack...

111
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,386
Help me.

112
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,757
So why did the hijackers surrender themselves?

113
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:13,296
Well, Miss Yamaguchi...

114
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:18,529
They knew they couldn't get away.

115
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,162
Miss Yamaguchi.

116
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,172
Good morning, Vice Principal.

117
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,400
Principal.

118
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,602
Oh... sorry.

119
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:26,837
May I?

120
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:32,416
"Passenger scolds hijackers?"

121
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,884
Was it you?

122
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,113
No.

123
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,551
Good.

124
00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:41,956
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

125
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:46,232
Don't forget.
I've told you many times.

126
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,061
We'll both be fired.

127
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:51,271
Don't attract attention to yourself.

128
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:56,240
A trainee teacher starts today, right?

129
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,877
He's not here yet.

130
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,478
Late from day one.

131
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:04,947
He needs to be disciplined.

132
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:07,445
I'm sorry I'm late.

133
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,557
I apologize.

134
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:15,724
Odagiri!

135
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,425
Yankumi...

136
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,067
Odagiri!

137
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:23,199
Baba...

138
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,668
You're...

139
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:27,305
That Odagiri?

140
00:11:27,741 --> 00:11:30,107
Vice Principal Monkey Brain.

141
00:11:30,444 --> 00:11:33,436
Principal Sawatari.

142
00:11:34,147 --> 00:11:35,478
Seriously?

143
00:11:35,616 --> 00:11:38,141
You know him, Miss Yamaguchi?

144
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:42,015
He was my student at Kurogin.

145
00:11:45,158 --> 00:11:50,460
I'm Ryu Odagiri, the trainee teacher.
Nice to meet you.

146
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,091
Let's go.

147
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:55,929
Good luck.

148
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:58,700
Welcome.

149
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,739
Give him proper guidance.

150
00:12:03,977 --> 00:12:05,239
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,080
It's been a while.

152
00:12:11,184 --> 00:12:16,247
You were such a handful back then.

153
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,220
But look at you now.

154
00:12:23,764 --> 00:12:27,256
This was my dream.

155
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:32,599
A student admiring me

156
00:12:32,773 --> 00:12:35,970
choosing to become a teacher.

157
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,602
What?

158
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:41,312
So, Odagiri...

159
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:47,384
You and me and the students united
with passion and sweat!

160
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:50,421
Follow my lead.

161
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:53,951
You're even more gung-ho.

162
00:12:56,964 --> 00:12:59,694
You don't want to be a teacher?

163
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:05,166
I don't know yet.
I just took the teacher-training course.

164
00:13:06,106 --> 00:13:09,735
You're not here because I'm here?

165
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,900
Of course not.

166
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:16,443
Oh...

167
00:13:18,051 --> 00:13:22,579
How're you doing with
your new troublemakers?

168
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:24,553
Not that well.

169
00:13:24,758 --> 00:13:27,352
I'm taking it slowly.

170
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:32,892
Teachers have to be patient
with their students.

171
00:13:33,634 --> 00:13:34,931
Join me.

172
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:42,968
You still do that?

173
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,768
Yes.

174
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,938
Good morning.

175
00:13:51,685 --> 00:13:53,050
Quiet, please.

176
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:56,454
Quiet down.

177
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:04,597
Quiet, please.

178
00:14:08,402 --> 00:14:11,303
I told you to be quiet!

179
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:18,475
"Teachers have to be patient," right?

180
00:14:21,815 --> 00:14:24,443
What're you babbling about?

181
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:27,051
You can't boss us around!

182
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,900
Who put out a cigarette here?

183
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,665
So that's why.

184
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:51,208
She was just lucky.

185
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:56,709
You have to use an ashtray.

186
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,745
That's not the point.

187
00:15:01,154 --> 00:15:03,714
Who was smoking?!

188
00:15:03,924 --> 00:15:05,084
- I dunno

189
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:06,850
- We wouldn't tell you anyway.

190
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:08,392
We don't sell out our friends.

191
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:12,725
We take good care of each other.

192
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,094
What's funny?

193
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:18,601
Nothing.

194
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,804
Smoking by minors is verboten.

195
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:24,308
Verboten?

196
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,002
What's that word?

197
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:32,179
Not being caught doesn't make things okay.

198
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,650
The sun's watching you.

199
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,246
The sun?

200
00:15:37,424 --> 00:15:38,857
What does that mean?

201
00:15:41,495 --> 00:15:43,463
Let me introduce him.

202
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:48,233
Mr. Ryu Odagiri, a trainee teacher.

203
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,700
To get acquainted with Mr. Odagiri,

204
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:57,536
let's play Kick the Can.

205
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:03,809
Change into your jerseys
and come to the field.

206
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:21,558
At least we can get acquainted.

207
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:22,668
No thanks.

208
00:16:26,573 --> 00:16:27,870
Dammit!

209
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,405
Uh-oh. Run!

210
00:16:37,117 --> 00:16:38,414
Whoa...

211
00:16:39,486 --> 00:16:43,081
That trainee teacher was
Yamaguchi's student.

212
00:16:43,256 --> 00:16:44,985
A delinquent at Kurogin.

213
00:16:45,158 --> 00:16:46,557
A delinquent-turned-teacher?

214
00:16:46,726 --> 00:16:48,023
No way.

215
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,069
Big news!

216
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:03,800
Unbelievable!

217
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:09,072
What's going on?!

218
00:17:12,485 --> 00:17:14,476
Listen to this!

219
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:16,085
What's up?

220
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:17,847
Why are you so amped up?

221
00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:20,424
You see!

222
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:24,058
You see!

223
00:17:25,065 --> 00:17:27,158
Stop talking at once.

224
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,303
Yankumi was walking with a guy.

225
00:17:34,474 --> 00:17:35,907
- You guys saw them too?

226
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:36,940
- Yeah.

227
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:38,542
He was even good-looking.

228
00:17:38,712 --> 00:17:39,804
- No way.

229
00:17:40,013 --> 00:17:41,037
- Probably an illusion.

230
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,375
- It was really her!

231
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:43,573
- It'll snow tomorrow!

232
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:45,241
Table for two, please.

233
00:17:46,653 --> 00:17:49,349
Sit. I recommend...

234
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:50,682
I know.

235
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,424
Guys! Long time no see.

236
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:57,723
How're you doing?

237
00:18:00,667 --> 00:18:02,157
Why are you gaping at me?

238
00:18:03,136 --> 00:18:04,660
Odagiri, it's you!

239
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:05,935
Hello.

240
00:18:06,072 --> 00:18:09,166
Ryu Odagiri, Yankumi's student
from Kurogin High.

241
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:10,503
Student?!

242
00:18:10,777 --> 00:18:13,439
Now I understand.

243
00:18:14,547 --> 00:18:16,242
So that's why...

244
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,712
They were worked up
because they saw you with a guy.

245
00:18:19,886 --> 00:18:22,150
They thought it was an illusion.

246
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:26,423
Yankumi could never find
a good-looking boyfriend.

247
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,083
Never.

248
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:29,558
We were such idiots.

249
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:31,096
Totally.

250
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,163
I told you "no way."

251
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:40,602
No way?

252
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:43,508
You guys, outside!
Right now!

253
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,577
What do you mean...

254
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,940
Calm down.
Two ramen noodles, please.

255
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,241
"Kumai Noodle Shop"

256
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:55,350
Yummy!

257
00:18:56,756 --> 00:18:58,724
I'm impressed.

258
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:01,621
You're going to school regularly.

259
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,353
We try.

260
00:19:03,897 --> 00:19:06,764
You've matured since high school.

261
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,168
How's work going for you guys?

262
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:12,532
Just great.

263
00:19:12,672 --> 00:19:15,197
Kura's always getting in trouble.

264
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,172
Don't tell.

265
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:23,613
I get in trouble with my dad at our tofu shop.

266
00:19:24,317 --> 00:19:27,115
Work is tough, no matter what it is.

267
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,485
I wish they'd pay me more.

268
00:19:30,657 --> 00:19:33,649
Yeah. That's why I'm getting a night job.

269
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:37,790
A night job?

270
00:19:41,034 --> 00:19:44,299
You idiot! A delivery job.

271
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:45,731
Oh.

272
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,969
I thought the shady type.

273
00:19:51,011 --> 00:19:52,569
Of course not.

274
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,374
What shady type?

275
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:59,678
You still having a hard time with your class?

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,017
Sort of.

277
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,746
We rejected her at first too.

278
00:20:04,958 --> 00:20:07,586
Yeah, her lectures were awful.

279
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,661
So annoying at first.

280
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:11,728
We bet on when she'd quit.

281
00:20:11,898 --> 00:20:13,263
We did too.

282
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:16,902
Really? How about you?

283
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,833
Probably.

284
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:21,670
Everyone's the same.

285
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,037
Yep.

286
00:20:35,388 --> 00:20:36,855
Are you crying?

287
00:20:37,924 --> 00:20:40,415
No, you idiot.

288
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:44,356
I'm happy.

289
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:52,327
My students from
different schools are here...

290
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,331
Laughing together...

291
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:01,506
Real happy.

292
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:06,107
I'm glad I became a teacher.

293
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:15,524
Wipe them.

294
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:24,228
Eat as much as you want.

295
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,964
Order anything. It's my treat.

296
00:21:28,408 --> 00:21:30,035
Roasted pork noodles!

297
00:21:30,176 --> 00:21:31,700
Dumplings, large portion!

298
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:32,834
Sounds good.

299
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,775
Large fried rice!

300
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:36,710
Kuma, bring them all.

301
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,044
It's before payday, isn't it?

302
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,654
No large portions. No roasted pork.

303
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,057
Cancel the dumplings.

304
00:21:51,631 --> 00:21:54,794
Just more noodles, okay?

305
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:56,960
More noodles for six.

306
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,037
No way!

307
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:05,840
Reita's late.

308
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:08,342
He'll be here soon.

309
00:22:08,748 --> 00:22:13,879
Yo, can I borrow some money?

310
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,180
Don't have any.

311
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:17,551
Shut up and hand it over.

312
00:22:23,763 --> 00:22:25,025
Reita!

313
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:27,595
Keep your hands off my friends.

314
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:31,337
Who are you?!

315
00:22:33,907 --> 00:22:39,038
Reita Takasugi of Akado.
Got a problem?

316
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:49,154
It was my dream to drink
with a student of mine.

317
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:52,151
Don't be shy, brother.

318
00:22:52,492 --> 00:22:53,516
Brother?

319
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,560
He means "friend."

320
00:22:55,728 --> 00:22:58,925
Wonderful, isn't it?

321
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:02,229
A student, now a responsible adult.

322
00:23:03,203 --> 00:23:07,196
It means you taught him well.

323
00:23:07,373 --> 00:23:09,238
That's not true.

324
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:10,103
I know.

325
00:23:14,647 --> 00:23:16,512
What'd you say?

326
00:23:18,151 --> 00:23:19,880
Tetsu, sit.

327
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:21,412
Certainly.

328
00:23:24,257 --> 00:23:25,121
Scary.

329
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:28,159
You had the brains, Odagiri.

330
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:29,761
- Minoru.
- Sorry.

331
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:34,958
Be prepared.

332
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:37,493
Drink 'til you drop.

333
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:47,537
That's My Lady.

334
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:56,448
"Be prepared" huh...

335
00:23:57,223 --> 00:24:00,056
She must've been so happy.

336
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:10,426
Her student finding his own path.

337
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:14,303
I haven't found mine yet.

338
00:24:18,444 --> 00:24:20,207
Gonna be a teacher, right?

339
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:24,877
No...

340
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:31,621
I thought I could

341
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,359
find my path in college but I couldn't.

342
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:44,494
So I started to panic.

343
00:24:47,774 --> 00:24:51,835
Then I remembered what she said.

344
00:24:55,214 --> 00:24:56,738
"Don't give up."

345
00:24:58,251 --> 00:24:59,878
"It's okay to fail."

346
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:09,857
She was sort of annoying
but taught me many things.

347
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:20,170
She puts her heart and soul into everything.

348
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:30,973
I want to find my own path like her.

349
00:25:48,534 --> 00:25:50,502
My head hurts.

350
00:25:52,004 --> 00:25:53,995
I'm gonna throw up.

351
00:25:56,576 --> 00:25:59,044
- Excuse me.
- Me too.

352
00:26:07,353 --> 00:26:08,479
Yankumi!

353
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,417
Takeda! Hyuga!

354
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:13,422
Long time no see.

355
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,118
How're you doing?

356
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,164
You two working hard?

357
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:21,562
Of course. Dumb question.

358
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,896
Look at me, a businessman.

359
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:29,331
What are you doing here?

360
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:31,674
Listening to his speech.

361
00:26:31,811 --> 00:26:34,075
Thank you for your time.

362
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,541
I've decided to run for
a seat in the Lower House.

363
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:42,978
My name is Kentaro Kurose.

364
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:46,091
Who is he?

365
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:52,164
You don't know? The president of
Dream Associates, an IT giant.

366
00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:54,932
He's amazing.

367
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:58,931
A former delinquent like us
who succeeded in business.

368
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:00,766
Now he'll be in the election.

369
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,704
Impressive.

370
00:27:03,876 --> 00:27:05,810
Yeah, he is.

371
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:12,175
Today I'm a success in the IT industry

372
00:27:12,351 --> 00:27:15,912
but I used to be a troublemaker.

373
00:27:16,689 --> 00:27:22,719
I was reformed thanks to
many people's support.

374
00:27:24,096 --> 00:27:30,296
I want to repay this society for accepting me.

375
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:37,302
Wonderful.

376
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:39,875
Wonderful.

377
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,543
You have my support.

378
00:27:45,685 --> 00:27:46,652
Thank you.

379
00:27:53,693 --> 00:27:56,218
You look like my old flame.

380
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:05,026
I bet you are kind and earnest

381
00:28:05,238 --> 00:28:08,002
and honest like him.

382
00:28:08,975 --> 00:28:10,203
Good luck.

383
00:28:11,911 --> 00:28:13,208
Let's go.

384
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,539
You're troubling him.

385
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:21,719
I'm rooting for you.

386
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:25,850
My name's Yamaguchi.

387
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:28,188
I'm rooting for you.

388
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,227
"Akado High School"

389
00:28:30,396 --> 00:28:34,059
Those guys yesterday pissed me off.

390
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,100
Whoever they were, Reita showed them.

391
00:28:38,237 --> 00:28:42,230
They talked big but they were pussies.

392
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,069
You're awesome, Reita.

393
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:45,267
Not really.

394
00:28:45,545 --> 00:28:47,945
- Another fight?
- Is that a problem?

395
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,813
Don't pop out of nowhere!

396
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:56,517
Fighting isn't necessarily bad but...

397
00:28:56,656 --> 00:28:58,248
Then leave us alone.

398
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:24,443
Reita Takasugi, come out here!

399
00:29:26,485 --> 00:29:29,420
I heard you and my buddies
got friendly yesterday.

400
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,317
The guys from yesterday...

401
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,552
They're the Black Skull.

402
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:37,929
Black Skull?

403
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,292
A bad motorcycle gang.

404
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:53,744
A motorcycle gang is outside.
Please hurry!

405
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:01,111
Let's go.

406
00:30:01,954 --> 00:30:03,888
We're not done with you!

407
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,166
Why on earth did you get involved
with that sort?!

408
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:19,862
Principal, they seem to be
a very violent group.

409
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:23,167
Extortions, assaults...
Many run-ins with the police.

410
00:30:23,709 --> 00:30:24,733
Scary.

411
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:28,945
A fight with guys like that of all people...

412
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:30,139
It wasn't a fight.

413
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:33,649
Reita stopped them from
extorting money from us.

414
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:37,984
You're saying it wasn't some foolish reason?

415
00:30:38,157 --> 00:30:40,489
If you don't believe us, then forget it.

416
00:30:42,261 --> 00:30:43,853
We can't forget it.

417
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,267
Is it true what you told us?

418
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:53,869
Yeah.

419
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,620
- Vice Principal.
- Principal.

420
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,660
They're not lying.

421
00:31:18,831 --> 00:31:20,856
You believe them?

422
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,397
I do.

423
00:31:23,235 --> 00:31:27,934
If they're lying,
I'll see it in their eyes.

424
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:36,246
Are you sure?

425
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:39,248
I'll hold you responsible.

426
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:45,415
The next time your students cause trouble,

427
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:47,615
you're fired.

428
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:50,792
Fine.

429
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:55,160
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

430
00:32:07,346 --> 00:32:10,008
- See it in our eyes?!
- She's trying to act tough.

431
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:11,673
She doesn't mean it.

432
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:14,411
Teachers are all the same.

433
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,587
You okay, Reita?

434
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,748
They're real bad asses.

435
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,325
Been arrested a lot.

436
00:32:24,296 --> 00:32:25,524
Serious?

437
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,022
They'll be back.

438
00:32:28,234 --> 00:32:29,861
We'll be in deep shit.

439
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:35,367
The next time your students cause trouble,

440
00:32:35,508 --> 00:32:36,839
you're fired.

441
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:40,873
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

442
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:49,377
Where're you going?

443
00:32:52,925 --> 00:32:54,552
To settle the matter.

444
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:57,753
- That's crazy.
- They'll kill you.

445
00:32:59,198 --> 00:33:02,326
I don't wanna owe her.

446
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,916
Let's start. Take your seats.

447
00:33:21,754 --> 00:33:22,948
What happened?

448
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:27,853
Takasugi took off.

449
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:31,628
To settle things with the bikers.

450
00:33:32,765 --> 00:33:36,201
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

451
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:50,480
You guys, why'd you let him go?

452
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:54,611
Why let him go alone?

453
00:33:55,721 --> 00:33:57,313
Because...

454
00:33:57,656 --> 00:33:59,521
Those guys are seriously bad...

455
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:04,524
Aren't you his friends?!

456
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:08,895
Yankumi...

457
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:22,108
Her ideas on friends and loyalty...

458
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,718
They're meaningless and annoying at first.

459
00:34:33,058 --> 00:34:34,719
We thought so too.

460
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:40,464
But now we understand.

461
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,828
The things she taught us...

462
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:53,672
Calling yourselves friends is easy

463
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:57,248
but that's just talk.

464
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:00,780
If you're friends for real,

465
00:35:02,588 --> 00:35:07,821
you stick together no matter what happens.

466
00:35:09,461 --> 00:35:11,019
Right?

467
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,364
What now?

468
00:35:21,273 --> 00:35:23,104
What should we do?

469
00:35:40,225 --> 00:35:44,457
You have balls coming here alone.

470
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:47,091
Fight me 1-on-1.

471
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,664
1-on-1?

472
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:54,272
If I win, stay away from us and our school.

473
00:35:54,606 --> 00:35:58,702
Did you hear that?

474
00:36:01,814 --> 00:36:03,543
Stop laughing!

475
00:36:05,718 --> 00:36:09,814
Too bad. I don't fight 1-on-1.

476
00:37:55,928 --> 00:38:01,059
Let him go... my precious student.

477
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:08,970
Who the hell are you?!

478
00:38:11,643 --> 00:38:15,579
I'm his homeroom teacher.

479
00:38:16,715 --> 00:38:18,546
A teacher?

480
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:46,909
You really messed him up.

481
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:52,649
You're pathetic.

482
00:38:52,818 --> 00:38:56,549
All of you ganging up on
one high school kid.

483
00:38:59,625 --> 00:39:01,855
We're teaching him a lesson.

484
00:39:02,094 --> 00:39:04,892
He gets this for being a cocky asshole.

485
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:08,426
Common sense, right?

486
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:11,827
Don't make me laugh.

487
00:39:11,937 --> 00:39:14,303
Common sense?

488
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,075
Don't pretend like you know
what you're talking about!

489
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:21,838
Watch it.

490
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:31,521
If words aren't enough, I'll fight you.

491
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:34,923
Let me warn you.

492
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:38,958
I don't hold anything back
to protect my students.

493
00:40:10,662 --> 00:40:11,594
Odagiri.

494
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:15,958
Fighting is done with bare hands.

495
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:24,566
Haven't had enough?!

496
00:40:52,304 --> 00:40:55,501
Odagiri... thanks.

497
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,006
Whatever.

498
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,153
Reita!

499
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:16,392
You okay?

500
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:18,256
Yeah.

501
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:22,198
Sorry you had to come alone.

502
00:41:22,968 --> 00:41:24,265
We're so sorry.

503
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:30,906
Forget about it.

504
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,178
You guys...

505
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:55,426
Now you're real friends.

506
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,742
So reckless, you...

507
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:17,352
No, you... What teacher fights?

508
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,422
This one.

509
00:42:24,363 --> 00:42:29,630
You fight to protect the things you cherish.

510
00:42:32,504 --> 00:42:33,903
Things you cherish?

511
00:42:34,206 --> 00:42:35,366
Yeah.

512
00:42:38,043 --> 00:42:42,673
I cherish you guys.

513
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:48,615
Teachers have to protect their students.

514
00:42:58,897 --> 00:43:02,731
All right! Let's run into the sunset!

515
00:43:04,836 --> 00:43:08,795
Follow my lead!

516
00:43:09,908 --> 00:43:13,400
You guys, follow me!

517
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:22,115
What a weird teacher.

518
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:25,354
She is.

519
00:43:25,757 --> 00:43:30,558
But no one else tries so annoyingly hard to

520
00:43:30,962 --> 00:43:32,759
relate to us.

521
00:43:38,136 --> 00:43:40,161
What sunset?

522
00:43:58,156 --> 00:43:59,418
Stop!

523
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,420
Stop!

524
00:44:33,258 --> 00:44:35,158
Good morning.

525
00:44:38,196 --> 00:44:39,356
Good morning.

526
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:43,027
G'morning.

527
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:44,226
Morning.

528
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:50,705
Mochizuki, Matsushita, Igarashi, Muto...

529
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:53,403
What?

530
00:44:53,912 --> 00:44:57,473
Did you just say that to me?

531
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:00,775
Who else is there?

532
00:45:01,186 --> 00:45:02,710
You complaining?

533
00:45:03,388 --> 00:45:05,379
Finally...

534
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:13,093
You guys are opening up to me.

535
00:45:13,932 --> 00:45:18,665
From now, the mornings will be...

536
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,368
Good morning.

537
00:45:23,675 --> 00:45:26,041
Good morning, Yankumi!

538
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:29,407
Good morning.

539
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:31,946
Good morning, Yankumi!

540
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:35,880
Good morning!

541
00:45:36,087 --> 00:45:38,487
Good morning, Yankumi!

542
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:40,450
Good morning, class.

543
00:45:41,426 --> 00:45:45,021
My beloved students.

544
00:45:47,632 --> 00:45:49,896
I knew it would come!

545
00:45:50,168 --> 00:45:53,604
A lovely morning like this!

546
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:57,008
You'll be late for the faculty meeting.

547
00:46:03,048 --> 00:46:04,572
Oops.

548
00:46:06,384 --> 00:46:08,909
Don't be late, you guys!

549
00:46:09,187 --> 00:46:10,984
Look who's talking.

550
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:18,286
Now that I am the principal

551
00:46:18,463 --> 00:46:20,727
I want you teachers to be

552
00:46:20,899 --> 00:46:25,393
strict with your pupils.

553
00:46:25,904 --> 00:46:29,101
The first semester is almost over.

554
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:32,708
The final exams start
next week so classes will be

555
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:35,539
shortened starting today.

556
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:40,208
Many students take advantage of the situation

557
00:46:40,385 --> 00:46:44,845
and use the extra time to
play around and get in trouble.

558
00:46:45,156 --> 00:46:50,321
Please make sure you prevent that.

559
00:46:50,629 --> 00:46:54,929
Yesterday, a student in Ara High

560
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,762
was arrested for drug possession.

561
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:00,034
For drugs?

562
00:47:00,438 --> 00:47:01,769
Miss Yamaguchi!

563
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:05,440
Idiot.

564
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:06,702
You're late.

565
00:47:06,911 --> 00:47:08,173
I'm sorry.

566
00:47:09,114 --> 00:47:14,518
Drug possession by a student
is a serious problem.

567
00:47:14,686 --> 00:47:15,914
A teacher being late...

568
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:18,487
Nowadays, even college students

569
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:21,524
and ordinary housewives are doing drugs.

570
00:47:21,726 --> 00:47:22,784
Is that true?

571
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:27,728
They don't understand
the terrible consequences.

572
00:47:28,667 --> 00:47:31,864
Drugs destroy the body and soul.

573
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,332
It's frightening.

574
00:47:33,505 --> 00:47:36,133
I hear a big drug ring is
running the operation.

575
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:42,341
That's unforgivable.

576
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:48,147
Getting rich by selling drugs...

577
00:47:48,853 --> 00:47:51,754
Where's their sense of duty and justice?

578
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:53,752
- Duty?
- Justice?

579
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:55,052
Miss Yamaguchi!

580
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,287
Such no-good rotten scumbags

581
00:47:59,864 --> 00:48:02,094
need a serious beatdown!

582
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:07,468
You're talking like a yakuza.

583
00:48:12,877 --> 00:48:14,367
Excuse us.

584
00:48:15,714 --> 00:48:18,182
Who are you?
We're in a meeting.

585
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:20,575
- We're the police.

586
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:21,708
- Police?

587
00:48:23,288 --> 00:48:24,846
"Faculty Room"

588
00:48:25,056 --> 00:48:27,183
Kazama dealing drugs?

589
00:48:30,228 --> 00:48:32,093
It can't be true.

590
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:35,155
He's not that kind of guy.

591
00:48:35,333 --> 00:48:37,062
It must be a mistake.

592
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:40,299
We were informed about

593
00:48:40,538 --> 00:48:43,871
a drug deal in a warehouse.

594
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:51,107
When we arrived there...

595
00:48:54,152 --> 00:48:57,417
The dealers were gone.

596
00:48:58,056 --> 00:49:03,585
But we found evidence and a wallet.

597
00:49:04,362 --> 00:49:05,659
Look.

598
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,125
It belongs to

599
00:49:10,268 --> 00:49:12,236
Ren Kazama.

600
00:49:16,207 --> 00:49:20,769
That doesn't prove he's the culprit.

601
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:23,203
That's right.

602
00:49:24,182 --> 00:49:29,017
But he's been missing since last night.

603
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:36,816
You guys, listen!

604
00:49:36,995 --> 00:49:39,896
The cops are after our
upperclassman Kazama.

605
00:49:40,732 --> 00:49:41,994
What did he do?

606
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,691
They said he sold drugs.

607
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:47,565
You're kidding.

608
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:03,217
A former student, a criminal...

609
00:50:03,721 --> 00:50:05,689
It's not for certain.

610
00:50:08,526 --> 00:50:11,893
I suppose so but...

611
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:17,397
I think it's true though.

612
00:50:18,336 --> 00:50:22,739
Me too.

613
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:28,009
He's 19, still just a kid.

614
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,172
Perhaps he wanted to make
some easy money.

615
00:50:32,317 --> 00:50:35,548
He'd never do anything like that.

616
00:50:35,787 --> 00:50:41,054
"My child would never..."
is an unsafe thought.

617
00:50:41,459 --> 00:50:46,522
And if he's innocent,
why would he be in hiding?

618
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:51,295
I'm sure there's a reason.

619
00:50:57,008 --> 00:51:01,274
Odagiri, take care of the class.

620
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:07,447
You're not going
to go look for him, are you?

621
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:11,680
He's not your student anymore.

622
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:13,346
You're wrong.

623
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:16,593
He is my student.

624
00:51:18,563 --> 00:51:19,757
Miss Yamaguchi...

625
00:51:19,898 --> 00:51:21,422
Miss Yamaguchi...

626
00:51:27,405 --> 00:51:30,306
Your call cannot be connected.

627
00:51:31,743 --> 00:51:33,005
Kazama...

628
00:52:01,105 --> 00:52:02,367
You guys...

629
00:52:10,949 --> 00:52:13,144
Kura told me about Ren.

630
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:16,287
The cops came to the office this morning.

631
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:19,919
Ren might get fired.

632
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:21,113
Oh no...

633
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:23,318
He'll never do anything illegal.

634
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:25,553
There must be a reason
why he's running.

635
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,357
- Yeah.
- There's gotta be.

636
00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:31,662
We believe in Ren.

637
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:37,198
He's our friend.

638
00:52:37,408 --> 00:52:39,501
Let's find him.

639
00:52:47,552 --> 00:52:49,110
You guys...

640
00:52:50,188 --> 00:52:52,918
Let's go find him!

641
00:53:25,123 --> 00:53:26,215
That way.

642
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,957
You go that way.

643
00:53:40,438 --> 00:53:41,837
Let's split up.

644
00:53:46,277 --> 00:53:47,403
Takasugi...

645
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:53,345
Have you seen Kazama?

646
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:54,573
No.

647
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:55,946
He's in trouble, right?

648
00:53:56,888 --> 00:53:59,083
He's done nothing wrong.

649
00:54:01,692 --> 00:54:05,890
If you see him, let me know.

650
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:07,792
Thanks.

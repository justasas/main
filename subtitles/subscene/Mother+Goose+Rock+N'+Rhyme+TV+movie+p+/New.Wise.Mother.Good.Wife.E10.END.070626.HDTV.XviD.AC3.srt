1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:12,840
Myung-Pil...there's a murderer
at your wife's place!

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,620
- What?
- I heard someone died.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,760
- Who died?
- Pardon me?

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,420
- Your wife...
- Guk-Hee?

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,540
Guk-Hee!

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,870
- Myung-Pil...
- Guk-Hee!

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,430
- Last Episode -

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,530
Guk-Hee, don't die!

9
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,860
I love you, Guk-Hee...

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,450
You were my one and only love!

11
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:50,620
I don't want to divorce you,
but I didn't have the nerve to tell you...

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,540
I can't live without you...

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,550
I'll die with you!

14
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,850
What are you doing?

15
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,810
Guk-Hee!

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,810
Guk-Hee! You're alive!

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,700
- Get up.
- What the...

18
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,540
Tae-Ran...

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,730
What do you think you're doing?

20
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,670
How dare you slap my son!

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,810
Mother...just leave her alone.

22
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,460
Hurry! We don't have much time.

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,470
Clear the way.

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,810
- Let me go!
- Be quiet!

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,700
Let me go!

26
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,520
You guys just wait and see.
You're gonna get it.

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,840
All hell broke loose.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,660
You reap what you sow.

29
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,620
In other words, serves her right.

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,460
What does Guk-Hee's
husband really want?

31
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,590
He's confusing me.

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,640
Let's go.

33
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,890
Thank you. Let's take
my car to the station.

34
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:13,580
- You guys are all okay, right?
- Yes.

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,430
I'll take you guys in my car.

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,730
- Come this way.
- Okay.

37
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,500
Too bad.

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,540
I'm not the fool who's still attached.

39
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,860
You're scared that an average person like me might win this fight with you.

40
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,500
I feel sorry for you.

41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,590
Don't mind me. Just do your own thing.

42
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,780
You know how to make money, but you don't know how to act like a person.

43
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,500
Hello?

44
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,480
What now?

45
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,620
Can you...stay here with me?

46
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,870
I'm too scared to go home.

47
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,670
What am I suppose to do now?

48
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,600
Why are you asking me that for?

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,820
You saw why I got smacked.

50
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,640
I told her that I love you
because I thought she was you....

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,570
People can act irrational
when you put them on the spot.

52
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:25,440
When you asked me for a divorce,
I told you that I'll be an acupuncturist.

53
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,510
That was crazy.

54
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:31,630
Just tell her that you didn't mean it.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,590
Today has been a rough day for me.

56
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,670
I need some rest.

57
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,700
Guk-Hee...

58
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,440
Hello?

59
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,650
It's me, Tae-Ran.

60
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,720
I have a favor to ask.

61
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,420
You wore those clothes yesterday.

62
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,800
Was it a one-night stand?

63
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,490
I was at the sauna last night.

64
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,690
Mr. Hur!

65
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,850
You're a lucky man.

66
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,500
Mr. Hur, did you do some lobbying?

67
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,750
What? What's going on?

68
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:44,890
You've been assigned to work
as a correspondent in America.

69
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:46,900
What?

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,500
Hello?

71
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,860
It's me, Tae-Ran.

72
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,600
Why didn't you come home last night?

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,760
I guess you didn't have
a good night's rest.

74
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,540
Uh...I was at the sauna.

75
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,480
I heard about the reassignment.

76
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,690
The VP here is a friend of my dad.

77
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,820
I think it's a good opportunity for us.

78
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,410
I wanted to take
a year off from work too.

79
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,520
Uh...Tae-Ran.

80
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,470
I don't think it's a good idea to...

81
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,720
We don't need to talk about
the things we're uncomfortable with.

82
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,500
We can talk about it later
when we're ready.

83
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,720
I'll look into schools for
Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk.

84
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Okay...

85
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,760
You told me that
you don't remember what I told you...

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,510
...or how many times I told you, right?

87
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,490
I waited a thousand days.

88
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm very confident about my decision.

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,860
I hope you enjoy the rest of your life.

90
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,700
What the...

91
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,830
It's her!

92
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,490
Ask her! Yun-Shil is still alive!

93
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,570
Don't making things up.

94
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,510
I'm not making things up!

95
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:09,450
Remember when you tried
to get Sniff and me but missed us?

96
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,530
Who called the Police?

97
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,770
It was a girl, right?

98
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:18,460
Did she tell you her name? No!

99
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,760
That was Yun-Shil!

100
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,770
She's still alive.

101
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,530
I want to sleep...

102
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:32,750
Get up! I'm treating you to tequila!

103
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,790
This is expensive!

104
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:43,570
I don't care. I want to go home.

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,470
Mr. Yeom! I don't want to go home!

106
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,650
Stay here with me.

107
00:08:50,650 --> 00:09:00,480
Just tell Tae-Ran that you love your wife!

108
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,490
Can you tell her for me?

109
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,450
You're nuts.

110
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,740
I want to go home.

111
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,840
I'm gonna go home. Bye.

112
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,760
Mr. Yeom! I'll buy a really
expensive wine for you!

113
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,440
Excuse me! Excuse me!

114
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,440
Tae-Ran, I'm sorry,
but it was just a fling....

115
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Let's break up.

116
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,480
Tae-Ran, I'm sorry...

117
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,610
I'm sorry....

118
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,820
I don't want to be a correspondent...
and I...don't want your money.

119
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,690
Tae-Ran...

120
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,480
What are you doing?

121
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,820
It'll take 20 days to arrive by ship.

122
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,590
We should start packing.

123
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,500
Why don't we look for
a place in Rancho Santa Fe?

124
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,470
We can go to the Horton Plaza,
the San Diego Zoo, and Point Loma.

125
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,770
Isn't it great?

126
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,710
Do you have anything else to pack?

127
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,470
Aren't you going to bed?

128
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,890
Tae-Ran, I have an article to write.

129
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,800
I think I need to pull an all-nighter.

130
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,450
Really?

131
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,670
Okay, goodnight.

132
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,870
Myung-Pil.

133
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,620
- Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk!
- Mommy!!

134
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,660
Oh, my babies...

135
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,500
Look at this!
I have Keroro stickers for you!

136
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,590
I got two stickers in one bag!

137
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:58,450
Awesome!

138
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,840
Hi.

139
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,420
You must've been through a lot.

140
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:21,650
Taking care of these boys is so tiring.

141
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:27,850
Kids need their mother
to take care of them.

142
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,880
Don't worry about the kids.

143
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,730
Just do what I've always been doing.

144
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,770
I'm late! I'm late!

145
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,490
Why are you here?

146
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,450
Did you sleep over here last night?

147
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,590
Well, it's none of my business.

148
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,650
I better get going now. Bye.

149
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,460
- Bye.
- Let's go.

150
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,800
You know that this is supposed
to be the man's job, right?

151
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,650
I want to get out of here.

152
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,540
That's the only thing
on my mind right now.

153
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:32,520
Remember the first day we made love?

154
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,600
It was great and we wanted each other.

155
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,610
I...love Guk-Hee.

156
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,430
I'm sorry.

157
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,470
What are you talking about?

158
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,880
I...love Guk-Hee.

159
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,810
How can you say that to me?

160
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,710
But it's true, Tae-Ran.

161
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,560
Get your hand off me!

162
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,900
- Tae-Ran!
- Let go!

163
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,710
- Tae-Ran!
- Let go! Let go!!

164
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,730
Tae-Ran, I yearned for a star.

165
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:35,500
I left because I thought
I would be happier on that star!

166
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:45,500
But after I got there,
I realized how great the earth is.

167
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,860
I don't want to be a star!

168
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,740
I'm sor...

169
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,880
Don't!

170
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,550
Don't tell me that you're sorry.

171
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,560
I won't let you say that.

172
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm the one who's dumping you.

173
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,450
I'm disappointed in you because
you can't get over Guk-Hee.

174
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:09,760
I'm over you now.

175
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,690
Looking good.

176
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,790
Why, I ought to...

177
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,440
Fatso?

178
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,590
I told you not to call me Fatso!

179
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,810
Why, I ought to...

180
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,770
Wait...

181
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,600
You're Fatso?

182
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,760
What happened to my Fatso?

183
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,440
You should call me Cutie from now on.

184
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:00,620
Oh yeah! It's been 15 days.

185
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,700
Remember, I'll leave you
when I get enough X's.

186
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,510
Why, I ought to...
Jang-mi, let's go!

187
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,830
All the men in this neighborhood
lust over other women.

188
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,600
How annoying.

189
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,610
What's this?

190
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,810
What's all this?

191
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,870
We came here to play poker
before you leave.

192
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,770
What happened?

193
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,570
Mr. Hur! Mr. Hur!

194
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm not going to America,
and I don't want to play poker.

195
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,540
Go away.

196
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,530
Myung-Pil.

197
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,800
Mr. Yeom! Maybe I should
just kill myself?

198
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,840
Don't say that.
That's wrong.

199
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,650
What am I supposed to do then?

200
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,740
Myung-Pil, listen.

201
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:14,730
Unlike us, the wives we married
in penury are benevolent.

202
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:19,780
If you play your cards right,
she might forgive you.

203
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,810
Just act dumb.

204
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:25,550
Go for it!

205
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,850
I am Hur Myung-Pil!

206
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,450
Gyung Guk-Hee, here I come!

207
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,770
Honey! Honey!

208
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
Honey! Honey!

209
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,720
Guk-Hee!

210
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,780
Eun-Suk! Gi-Suk!

211
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,720
Hi, Dad!

212
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,810
After a storm comes a calm.

213
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,720
Hardships come to those
who press onward.

214
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,520
Let's just say that this will
strengthen our bond.

215
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,700
Let's just shake it off.

216
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,710
Pack your things and come home!

217
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,850
We can talk at home.

218
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,830
Kids! I'm talking to you too!

219
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,870
Yes, Guk-Hee! Come!

220
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,820
Yes...

221
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,810
You're going to pack your things, right?

222
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,750
See that?

223
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,500
Kids! Pack your things too
and let's go home!

224
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,850
Kids, I have to go.

225
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,860
Honey, I'll be back.

226
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,460
Myung-Pil!

227
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
Not you again...

228
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,640
Do you want her now that
she's not yours anymore?

229
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,430
What?

230
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,700
You think I'm ridiculous, right?

231
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,710
Still, I don't have to hear that from you!

232
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,700
Of course you do.

233
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,430
I'm the closest man to Guk-Hee.

234
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,530
I don't know about before, but you can't act dumb in front of Guk-Hee anymore.

235
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,560
As her man, I'd like to
tell you to give it up.

236
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,550
You're too late.

237
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,840
No, I'm not!

238
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,560
What makes you say that?

239
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,630
That's up to Guk-Hee.

240
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,890
Her man?

241
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,630
Yeah right.

242
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,880
I know Guk-Hee very well.

243
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,810
You don't know anything.

244
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:25,410
More people asked to put ads on our Good Wife Disqualification Club!

245
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:26,420
Really?

246
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,670
We're making a lot of money.

247
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,660
We won't have to worry
about food anymore.

248
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,680
What now?

249
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,520
I hate bad drunks!

250
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,870
Me too! What's his problem?
So noisy!

251
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,670
I think he's in front of our house!

252
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,560
Who is he?

253
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,630
- I'll go and check.
- Okay.

254
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,490
What is this?

255
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,760
Oh my, who is that?

256
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,780
Guk-Hee!

257
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,590
Hello, everyone!

258
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,810
What are you doing?

259
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,710
Just kidding.

260
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,660
What do you think you're doing?

261
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,740
Get up! Get up!

262
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,840
You've completely lost it.

263
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,780
Get up! Not here!

264
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:31,500
You've completely lost it. Get up!

265
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,870
What is this, the refugee camp?

266
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,610
How annoying!

267
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,440
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,880
Look at you!

269
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,730
I hate that too.

270
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,750
He's completely wasted.

271
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:50,460
Guk-Hee. Guk-Hee...

272
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,650
Guk-Hee!

273
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,720
Guk-Hee... Hey...

274
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,840
I'm not Fatso! I'm Cutie...

275
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,560
What's wrong with the people
in this house?

276
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,580
Including him!

277
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,470
He's so...

278
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,670
Why aren't you sleeping?

279
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,610
I knew it from the beginning.

280
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,460
You didn't reek of alcohol at all.

281
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,770
Yes, I put on a show.

282
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,470
What do you think you're doing?

283
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,640
Be quiet!

284
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,770
Why should I be quiet?

285
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,420
You dork!

286
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,480
I was in junior high
when you were in diapers!

287
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,710
So? You don't even act your age.

288
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,630
What the...

289
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,640
Let's settle this once and for all tonight.

290
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,900
Sounds good.

291
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,510
Loser gives up Guk-Hee.

292
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,740
Gives up?

293
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,410
Why, I ought to...

294
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,490
You're going to lose!

295
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:44,900
You should call home and tell your parents to prepare for your funeral.

296
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,780
Why don't you call them instead,
old man!

297
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,830
Don't call me an old man!

298
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,770
You don't like that one?

299
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,780
Fine then. Hey man!

300
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,770
Hey man?

301
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,540
Don't hey man me!

302
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,430
Okay then.

303
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,870
Yo, Myung-Pil!

304
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,620
Why, I ought to...

305
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm going to kill you!

306
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,490
Dork!

307
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,850
You're going to get it!

308
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,480
What's going on?

309
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,900
What are you guys doing?

310
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,520
Stop it!

311
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,670
Not you again!

312
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,690
Honey! He punched me harder!

313
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,590
That's exactly what I told you
when I had a fight with Tae-Ran.

314
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,600
You didn't even listen to me,
and told me that it was my fault.

315
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,900
Get out. Now!

316
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,730
Honey, I have something to tell you.

317
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,550
I just didn't have
the chance to say it to you.

318
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,800
Please let me talk to you tomorrow! Please?

319
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
What do you want to give me?

320
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,690
I don't want anything from you.

321
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,870
I saw your notebook.
One thousand days...

322
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,530
These are the divorce papers.

323
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,440
This is the last thing I can do for you.

324
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,440
You're free now.

325
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:31,580
I'm sorry.

326
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:41,710
I wanted to go back,
but I didn't have the nerve to.

327
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,720
I was too prideful.

328
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,870
I was agitated because I didn't know when we'll buy a house...

329
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,610
...and pay for the kids' tuition.

330
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:01,750
I was tired of making it through the day.

331
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,830
I was always being compared to others.

332
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,470
Then I felt as though I got
a magic wand in my hand.

333
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:21,680
I don't think I gave much though
about where happiness comes from.

334
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:30,660
I'm not saying that making and raising
a family with you didn't make me happy.

335
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,450
I just wasn't used to it.

336
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,670
Can you please forgive me?

337
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:54,760
I haven't forgotten the vow
I made at this place.

338
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,490
I was just disillusioned for a short time.

339
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:19,890
Right, this is where we had our wedding.

340
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,850
You made your vow there, and so did I.

341
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,620
We were happy.

342
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,680
We didn't know what
our marriage will be like.

343
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:54,890
I trusted your vow,
and I tried to keep mine as well.

344
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:06,550
After 8 years, our promises faded.

345
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:16,450
You should've let me keep my faith.

346
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,570
That would've given me
the courage to start all over again.

347
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:35,560
The promises we made
in the beginning have been tainted.

348
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,740
What has become of them now?

349
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:50,880
No matter how tough and demanding life is, you shouldn't have gone that far.

350
00:31:50,880 --> 00:32:03,710
I don't want to start over again.

351
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,790
Dig in.

352
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,880
Look at your face!
You've gotten so pale.

353
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,470
Here's your soup.

354
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,540
Mom...

355
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,530
You taught me to study hard
and become successful.

356
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:15,620
How come you never taught me
to become a good husband?

357
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,500
Teach you to become a good husband?

358
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,580
Was that my job?

359
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,460
I'm supposed to learn.

360
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,710
I need to know in order to live well.

361
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,780
I don't feel like eating.

362
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,870
Gi-Suk, bye.

363
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:53,850
Bye.

364
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:55,540
Let's go.

365
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:17,670
If you don't want to start over,
you don't have to try.

366
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,670
I'll put in all the efforts from now on.

367
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,580
I'll be here everyday
for the next 1,000 days.

368
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,770
I'll show you that
I can be a good husband.

369
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,780
Today's my first day.

370
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,630
And how are you going to do that?

371
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:47,800
Uh...for as long as I live, you will be
the only woman in my life!

372
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,450
I'll never have any
other woman besides you.

373
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,600
I swear!

374
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,890
Do you think you can be a good husband by not cheating on me?

375
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,450
That's a given.

376
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,860
Guk-Hee!

377
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,650
Time to go to the fish market.

378
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,710
Here's a list of the things we should buy.

379
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,640
- Check if anything's missing.
- I think this is good.

380
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,610
Why, that...

381
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,700
Hi!

382
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,790
Hi.

383
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,710
What are you doing?

384
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:38,530
I'll do all the grocery shopping
if you live with me.

385
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:39,710
I'll do all the dishes.

386
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,560
We can split all the household chores.

387
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,760
What do you think?

388
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,510
You don't know what's really important.

389
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,610
That's your problem.

390
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,800
And what would that be?

391
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,440
Guk-Hee!

392
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,570
Why, you...

393
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,780
You wanted to take a seminar
on managing websites, right?

394
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,660
- Yes.
- There's one today.

395
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,810
Let's go and check it out.

396
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:10,450
Are you sure it's free?
I'll get my purse.

397
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,810
Wait.

398
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,670
Ta-dah!

399
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,800
It's already here.

400
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,620
Good.

401
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,840
Have fun.

402
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,540
Bye.

403
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,530
Why, that little...

404
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,570
You should give me
some credit for trying.

405
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,890
Do Eun-Suk's science and math homework, brush the kids' teeth.

406
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,730
Get flu shots for the kids and
go on family trips every weekend.

407
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,580
Don't play poker.

408
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,690
It's too long to finish
reading in one sitting.

409
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,870
I'm going to do everything on the list! What do you think?

410
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,800
Good job.

411
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,610
But you still don't know
what's really important.

412
00:37:10,610 --> 00:37:13,850
And what will that be?
Tell me. I'll put it on the list.

413
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,580
Find out for yourself.

414
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,620
Guk-Hee, it's almost time.
Let's go.

415
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,460
Okay, let's go.

416
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,410
Where are you going?

417
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,650
Let's take a 5 minute break.

418
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,540
You're beautiful!

419
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,750
Tae-Ran, let's meet up.

420
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,490
I came here to interview you
even though this isn't my story.

421
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,440
Want to play poker?

422
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,820
Hey, we're here to work.

423
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,720
Your new screenplay is titled
"The Murder Case of Mr. Hur."

424
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,520
A man named Mr. Hur is chopped
and murdered into 32 pieces.

425
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,830
Why did you decide to write
something so grotesque?

426
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,590
You usually write about love.

427
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,800
There's no such thing as love...

428
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,850
What happened?

429
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,700
You can overcome your doubt with love!

430
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,520
Tae-Ran, let me help you.

431
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,660
What will happen if people
find out that Yun-Shil is alive?

432
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,580
Sniff and White Pants will be free.

433
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,570
They'll probably blame
everything on Yun-Shil.

434
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,690
That'll be awful.

435
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,790
Hello?

436
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,540
Newspaper?

437
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,450
You want to do an article about
the Good Wife Disqualification Club?

438
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,510
You're getting more and more ads.

439
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:06,440
Your club is getting lots of
support from other women.

440
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,460
Things really must be tough
for the other women out there.

441
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:20,610
Myung-Pil, do you have
anything to ask them?

442
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,710
No.

443
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,430
Can I take a picture of you three?

444
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,640
Sure thing!
Hold on...

445
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:36,740
Ta-dah!

446
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,650
By the way, why don't you cover the Good Wife Disqualification Club's...

447
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,560
...boyfriend?

448
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,730
Ta-dah!

449
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,900
I'm their boyfriend.

450
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,870
Are you the cute boyfriend they write about on their message board?

451
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,520
Yes, Suk-Doo.

452
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,650
I wish I had a boyfriend like you.

453
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,810
I have to use the restroom.

454
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,700
I'm the one who dumped Myung-Pil.

455
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,450
I want to give work
my undivided attention.

456
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,830
You didn't win.

457
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,490
You don't need to confirm that with me.

458
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,700
I never competed with you.

459
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,870
We can't have a competition
because we're walking different paths.

460
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,880
Is that so?

461
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:13,450
Then why did we end up
meeting each other?

462
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:16,510
Because everyone's
looking for happiness.

463
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,720
Myung-Pil and you started going out because you both wanted to be happy.

464
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,430
That's how the three of us
got tangled up like this.

465
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,560
Why are you so confident?

466
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,850
Are you telling me that
you found a way to be happy?

467
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,480
Yes, and I hope you find it too.

468
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,490
You don't need to worry about me.

469
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:43,860
Gyung Guk-Hee!

470
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,840
I'm sorry.

471
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,790
What? Sure, I'll be there.

472
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,480
We're busy as a bee today.

473
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,640
We need to go to the real estate agency right after the interview.

474
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,510
Real estate agency? For what?

475
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,450
For the house you sued for.

476
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,690
Let's go!

477
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,820
Wait, I'll get the car ready.

478
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,870
Okay.

479
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,850
Oh, and another thing.

480
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:26,800
Women won't agree that you need
to be financially set to be a good wife.

481
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,870
Does that mean you don't think
we have a modern good wife?

482
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:36,420
No, we need a modern good wife.

483
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,830
But if you think about it,
why say 'good wife?'

484
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:47,830
Where's the self?

485
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,800
A woman will be unhappy if she lives...

486
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,460
...only as someone's mother
or wife instead of living as herself.

487
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:59,860
I think a good wife is someone
who pursues her own happiness.

488
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,520
Especially in this day and age,
a woman will go postal...

489
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,880
...if she doesn't pursue
her own happiness.

490
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,830
Su-Duk agrees with Guk-Hee.

491
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,730
I'm with Guk-Hee!

492
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,730
Let's go.

493
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,420
Gyung Guk-Hee, Nam Jang-Mi,
and Kim Su-Duk...

494
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,680
This is the first time I've sold
a house under three women's names.

495
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,470
A place where we can take each other in no matter what the circumstances are...

496
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,600
This is the Good Wife
Disqualification Club headquarters.

497
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,700
Su-Duk is so happy!

498
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,640
How did Yun-Shil think of this?

499
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,850
I'm disappointed in you guys.
What about me?

500
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,670
You're a lifetime member.

501
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,890
You can come by anytime...
as our boyfriend.

502
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,510
Really?

503
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,730
Girls, you do know that
we have a lot to do today, right?

504
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:13,860
Where are we going now?

505
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,440
We're supposed
to meet up with Yun-Shil.

506
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,590
You're right!
Let's go.

507
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,900
Thank you. Bye!

508
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,600
I'm Gyung Guk-Hee,
and I'm at the beach!

509
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,430
This time, I came at daytime!

510
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:35,700
Hello, beach!

511
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:39,710
I'm here too! I'm free!

512
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,880
Hey! Su-Duk is here too!

513
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,490
I don't have to cook tonight!

514
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,740
Their boyfriend Park Suk-Doo
is here too! Yes!

515
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,760
How annoying...

516
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,750
Yun-Shil!

517
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,470
Yun-Shil!

518
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,550
Yun-Shil!

519
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,690
Awesome!

520
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,580
Myung-Pil, you might have
to give that award back.

521
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:40,530
The women are angry that you need
to be financially set to be a good wife.

522
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,630
We should write about the
Good Wife Disqualification Club asap.

523
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,850
Oh, and about what you wife said...

524
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,740
Okay, I'll make a decision.

525
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:57,770
A woman who pursuits her own happiness is the modern good wife.

526
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,420
Fine, I'll make her a modern good wife!

527
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,450
This is great.

528
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,750
The air of freedom.

529
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,790
I love freedom.

530
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,580
I'm impressed. You always
tell us that you hate something.

531
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,740
There are things that I like.
It's just that I didn't mention them.

532
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:27,410
Su-Duk is happy too.

533
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,630
I feel as though I'm flying.

534
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,780
I wonder what would've happened if
we didn't come to the beach that night.

535
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,820
We would've stayed the same.

536
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,600
My family would still be
blaming me for losing that house.

537
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:46,790
Su-Duk was a Fatso...a woman
who hides food from her husband.

538
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:51,450
I might've committed suicide after
being cooped up in my house all alone.

539
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:56,660
I was a loner who couldn't tell
anyone what I was going through.

540
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,630
I think your dreams came true.

541
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:05,680
We made it big,
but our dreams didn't come true.

542
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,500
Our dream wasn't to throw
White Pants and Sniff into prison.

543
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,440
I've always wanted to help others.

544
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,580
You already did.

545
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:21,570
You helped size 8 women
by finding clothes for them.

546
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:24,480
Hey, you're right!

547
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,530
What about Su-Duk?
Su-Duk wanted to be a stewardess.

548
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,620
You said you feel as though you're flying.

549
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,810
Your dream came true.

550
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:35,600
Is that so?
You're right...

551
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:39,460
I think I like this better.

552
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:41,730
I've always wanted to have a family.

553
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,490
I'm still by myself.

554
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:47,590
You think you're by yourself?

555
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,530
Oh, I'm sorry.

556
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:54,810
I'm no longer by myself.

557
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,790
Does that mean I'm the only one left?

558
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,770
I wanted to be a good wife.

559
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:07,770
No, but you got to be something else.

560
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:15,740
You became
a modern good wife instead.

561
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,690
You found your happiness and
found your family's happiness.

562
00:49:22,550 --> 00:49:24,600
We're on a roll.

563
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,710
How annoying.

564
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,480
There you go again!

565
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,820
How annoying!

566
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:35,610
- But we like you!
- Don't!

567
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,520
A mental institute? Me?

568
00:49:52,810 --> 00:50:00,700
We've been keeping an eye
on you for the last few days.

569
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,770
We think you need help.

570
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:07,620
Hey! Why are you sending me
to the nuthouse?

571
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,740
Yun-Shil is still alive!

572
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:11,750
Hey! Yun-Shil is still alive!

573
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,470
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

574
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,550
Why should I go to a nuthouse?

575
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,420
I think it's been about 5 years
since I came to a place like this.

576
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,440
What's up?

577
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,460
Guk-Hee, this wasn't easy.

578
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:11,560
I've contemplated this over and over...and finally reached a decision.

579
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:23,490
Remember, not everyone can
make a decision like this.

580
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,900
Just get to the point.

581
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:35,540
A good wife who pursuits her own happiness is the modern new wife.

582
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,760
Got it!

583
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:45,500
Truthfully, you do smile a lot
when you're with Suk-Doo.

584
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,870
If Suk-Doo Park makes you happy,
I'll approve of him.

585
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:57,510
That little kid, Suk-doo Park!

586
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:07,620
I'll acknowledge him as your boyfriend.

587
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,820
I'll pursue your happiness.

588
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:17,720
There's more.

589
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,890
Boyfriend Coupon

590
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:46,420
Tae-Ran and I...only slept
with each other 9 times.

591
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:48,640
That's it.

592
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:53,460
I was too busy fighting with you,
and even got a backache.

593
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,530
Why are you telling me this?

594
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,450
I'll give you 9 coupons.

595
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:04,430
Remember what I promised you?
To get even?

596
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:09,610
You can get even with me.

597
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,770
I'm speechless.

598
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,630
Guk-Hee!

599
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,860
You're smiling!

600
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,430
You smiled!

601
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,620
It's been so long since
you last smiled at me.

602
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,530
You only smile at Suk-Doo.

603
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,580
Thank you.

604
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,500
Thanks, Guk-Hee.

605
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,700
Okay then!

606
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,840
I'll give you one more coupon!

607
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,480
What?

608
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:52,430
This is it, Guk-Hee.

609
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,800
This is how we can start over.

610
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:01,450
Start over?

611
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:06,750
No...this means a lot to me.

612
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,690
Just give me one month.

613
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:25,740
I'll show you how much
I can change in one month.

614
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:35,630
If you still don't want me after
one month, I'll accept your decision.

615
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:49,870
Even if we don't get back together,
one month is not a waste of time.

616
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:56,700
You can spare me a month, right?

617
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,780
Please, Guk-Hee?

618
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:10,530
Fine, you have a month.

619
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,860
That's it.

620
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:22,480
Since you gave this to me, I'll take it.

621
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,470
Sure! Take it! Take it!

622
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,460
Boyfriend coupon?

623
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,750
How can you give that to your wife?

624
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:45,430
Guk-Hee smiled.
That's all I need.

625
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,890
What if she uses it on that kid?

626
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,860
Well...

627
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,480
I'm happy right now.
Don't ruin it.

628
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:01,710
That made her smile, right?

629
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,860
Yes.

630
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:07,570
Can you tell me
how to make that coupon?

631
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:12,520
Do I write 'Boyfriend Coupon'
on a piece of paper?

632
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,460
You don't need to
put an expiration date?

633
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:16,570
How do you make that?

634
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:18,510
What are you doing?

635
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:28,880
My wife found out that
I've been sleeping around.

636
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:30,730
What?

637
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:43,580
If I don't do something for her,
she'll ask for a divorce.

638
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,790
How am I supposed
to make that coupon?

639
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:54,850
She sent us plane tickets.

640
00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:01,740
She's going to invite all of us!
Including Eun-Suk and Gi-Suk!

641
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,860
Wow!

642
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:07,520
You're right! Kim Su-Duk!

643
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,740
That means Su-Duk
can finally get on a plane!

644
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:11,460
Wait a second...Nigeria?

645
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,760
Yun-shil is in Africa!

646
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,540
But of all the countries, why Nigeria?

647
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,700
Nigeria?

648
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:28,720
Yun-Shil is awesome!

649
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,810
That place practices polyandry.

650
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:38,830
I knew she had a dirty mind!

651
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:51,410
Africa...how exciting!

652
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,860
Something always happens
when I'm with you guys.

653
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,480
Don't say that.

654
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,420
What if we lose someone?

655
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,730
Don't lose anyone.

656
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,670
I'm going to date an African chief.

657
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:03,790
Me too.

658
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,470
The size 8 women of Korea
are waiting for Su-Duk.

659
00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:11,720
Don't worry! Even if we lose someone,
we'll solve the case again!

660
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,720
Cutie!

661
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:17,750
Cutie! Cutie!

662
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,510
Cutie! Let me go with you.

663
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,550
I even got a ticket.

664
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:25,810
No, I don't want to go with you.

665
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:31,730
Cutie! I'll do anything you say.

666
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:37,680
I'll call you Cutie and
thank you every time you cook for me.

667
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,540
Take me with you.

668
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:40,610
I don't want to.

669
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:42,450
Su-Duk never asked you to come!

670
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,420
Cutie...

671
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,500
Go away! Why I ought to....!

672
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,840
- Let's go guys.
- Let's go.

673
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,500
Guk-Hee!

674
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:03,600
Honey!

675
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,520
Eun-Suk! Gi-Suk!

676
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,600
Take me with you.

677
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,520
What are you doing?

678
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,460
I got myself a ticket.

679
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,410
I can speak English.

680
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:25,600
People in Nigeria speak Hausa.

681
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,420
I can speak Hausa.

682
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,750
What about the treasurer?

683
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,510
You need a treasurer
to manage money during the trip.

684
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:39,430
Yes! That's very important!

685
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:44,450
Wait! That's my job.

686
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,530
That's his job.

687
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,670
- I think we should go on our own.
- Huh?

688
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:55,680
Hey, why don't we go together?

689
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,460
What?

690
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,500
- Let's go.
- Okay.

691
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,770
You two can go together.

692
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,740
Are you sure you're not
going to get into any trouble?

693
01:00:13,470 --> 01:00:15,440
Of course not!

694
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,850
Don't mind us two.

695
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,640
Right, don't mind us.

696
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:23,430
Let's go.

697
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,840
By the way, what was the body
we burned thinking it was Yun-Shil?

698
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,800
You're right.

699
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,530
It's a mystery, I tell you.

700
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:49,440
I hate mysteries.

701
01:00:56,510 --> 01:02:15,870

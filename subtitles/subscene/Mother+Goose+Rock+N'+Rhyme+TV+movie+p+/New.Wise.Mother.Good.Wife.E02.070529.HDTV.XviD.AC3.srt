1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,880
Yun-Shil!

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,150
Yun-shil, where are you?

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,910
Answer me!

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,840
Yun-Shil!

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,710
Yun-Shil!

6
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,990
Yun-shil, where are you?

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,050
Yun-Shil!

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,840
Yun-Shil!

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,010
Yun-shil!

10
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,910
Yun-Shil!

11
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,150
Answer me!

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:28,870
Yun-Shil!

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,960
Yun-Shil!

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,810
Yun-Shil!

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,990
Yun-Shil!

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,680
Where is she?

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,820
Yun-Shil! Yun-Shil!

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,100
Yun-Shil...

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,060
What are we going to do?

20
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,150
We can't find her.

21
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
It's almost morning.

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,770
Su-Duk needs to go and make breakfast.

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,700
Oh, no...

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,710
Call her.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,720
I don't know her number.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,740
Do you?

27
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,740
No.

28
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,970
Wait, she called her cell phone with my phone because she couldn't find hers.

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,030
Really?

30
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,910
I found it!

31
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,910
Is it me?

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
No.

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,710
I think it's from the restroom.

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,740
But we were here before.

35
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,920
Yun-Shil... Yun-Shil...

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,050
Yun-Shil...

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,970
She told us that she's going to the restroom around...3:30am.

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,100
We started looking
for her around 4...right?

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,890
Huh?

40
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,830
I think so.

41
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,790
Oh no, oh no!
I have to go and make breakfast.

42
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:12,750
I see.

43
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,800
Let's talk outside.

44
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,080
Is she going to be okay?

45
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,970
Maybe she ran away,
maybe she didn't.

46
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,010
Well, I can't tell you anything as of now.

47
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,970
Did you all see the
pervert from the restroom?

48
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,940
No, only one person did.

49
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,100
I saw him too.

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,700
I remember how he looks like.

51
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,110
I need your info.

52
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,000
Your names, addresses...

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,090
No! I can't give it to you!

54
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,130
I don't want someone to find me!

55
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,830
Give it to me.

56
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,770
We need it for the missing person.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,660
Don't worry,
we won't disclose it to anyone.

58
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,710
Officer, Su-Duk needs to go
and make breakfast.

59
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,020
Let us go, please?

60
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,090
We need to go home as soon as we can.
We can't be late.

61
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,110
I see, but we need one person
to come to the station with us.

62
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,760
I'll stay.

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,680
Okay, you can come with me.

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,690
The rest of you can leave after
giving us your numbers and addresses.

65
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,090
Im Tae-Ran! You're so lucky!

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,950
You have everything!

67
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,970
Are you okay?

68
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:27,090
Don't worry, I can swim my way out
even if I fell into a jar of liquor.

69
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,880
You're not the only one
having a tough time.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,900
Who else is having a tough time? You?

71
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,820
Kang Jin dumped me.

72
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,690
We've been going out for over a year,
but he didn't say anything.

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,970
So I proposed to him first.

74
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,940
And?

75
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:57,860
He said he likes me, and that
I'm perfect, except...I'm too old.

76
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,920
What a dimwit!

77
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
He's the same age as you, right?

78
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,150
That kid doesn't know anything.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,070
Tae-Ran, you're the kind of girl
a man should marry.

80
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,080
Look at me!

81
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,070
Look what happened to me because
I didn't marry someone like you!

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:42,780
I should've married you when
you told me that you like me.

83
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,910
Don't you think so?

84
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,880
I should've married you instead!

85
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,800
Myung-Pil...

86
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,810
Myung-Pil! That hurts...

87
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,000
Tae-Ran, are you okay?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,900
Myung-Pil, where are we?

89
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,900
You're heavy.

90
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,800
Myung-Pil...

91
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,760
Tae-Ran!

92
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,760
Myung-Pil!

93
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,110
I have to go. I have a meeting to attend.

94
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,870
Why is there so much traffic?

95
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,020
Hurry!

96
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,800
What are we going to do?

97
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,780
Be quiet, will you?

98
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,080
You have nothing to worry about because you don't have a husband.

99
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:30,670
Are you bragging that
you have husband?

100
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,080
What are we going to do?

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,130
If this is a dream, please wake me up.

102
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,790
Oh, no!

103
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,680
It's morning, and this isn't a dream.

104
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,920
I can't believe I didn't
go home last night.

105
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,150
Me too!

106
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,770
My husband should
be back from his shift.

107
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,130
I'm so dead!

108
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,060
I hate people who bring
trouble upon others!

109
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,770
Oh, no...

110
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,930
Lord, what should I do?

111
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:56,960
My pass! My pass!
Be quiet, will you?

112
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,910
Please let me make
breakfast for my kids.

113
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,850
My husband didn't call.

114
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,940
My husband didn't call either! How come you didn't remember to bring your pass?

115
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,820
Ah!! Be quiet!! Quiet!!

116
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,890
What are we going to do?

117
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,110
Hurry up!

118
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,950
Be quiet!

119
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,780
Were you worried about me?

120
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,750
I had a few drinks because
I was in a bad mood.

121
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,730
I found myself at the bar in the morning.

122
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,040
Things like this happen when men drink!

123
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,840
I wonder if she'll buy that.

124
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,070
She has no choice!

125
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,720
She didn't see what happened last night!

126
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,100
This is driving me crazy...

127
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,750
Honey, I went to the beach
because I was in a bad mood.

128
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,880
No, no... Honey...

129
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

130
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,740
This is the first time
I stayed out until morning!

131
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,130
Honey...

132
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,920
No.

133
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,900
Please forgive me, honey.

134
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,070
I'll do anything you say.

135
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,850
I shouldn't have had
that cocktail last night...

136
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:28,950
Honey...

137
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,920
Ho...honey...

138
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,080
Why is she here?

139
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,030
Was she waiting for me?

140
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,060
He's here to get me.

141
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,930
What am I going to do?

142
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,040
This is driving me crazy.

143
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,840
What am I going to do?

144
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:13,100
Why isn't she saying anything?

145
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,870
I didn't come home last night.

146
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,910
I thought he'd say something about it.

147
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,850
Mom!

148
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,750
Did you decide to get
on my bad side for good?

149
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,990
Did you guys go for a walk...

150
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,780
...after making your old
mother-in-law take care of the kids?

151
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,770
- Mother..
- Mom..

152
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,940
I sent Eun-Suk to school.

153
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,890
He wants his art homework.

154
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:44,060
Okay.

155
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,840
B...B..Bye.

156
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,840
Bye, Grandma!

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,740
By the way!

158
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,670
You have to get Grandfather's
memorial from his brother's house.

159
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,880
But the house is a little too small...

160
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,770
I was going to let you bring it
after you buy a house...

161
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,130
...but I don't know
when that's going to be.

162
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,730
Let's get the dishes
for the service for now.

163
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,970
Okay.

164
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,800
Goodbye, Grandma.

165
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,690
Are you hungry?

166
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,730
Huh?

167
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,030
Uh...yes.

168
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,060
That's weird.

169
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,910
Why isn't she doing anything?

170
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,130
Maybe she doesn't know that
I didn't come home last night.

171
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,980
He doesn't look mad.

172
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,760
Maybe he doesn't know that
I didn't come home last night.

173
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,070
Did she go to bed early?

174
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,910
Maybe he was too drunk to remember.

175
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,680
I'll make you breakfast.

176
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,780
Okay...

177
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,720
Honey!

178
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,150
When did you sleep last night?

179
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,670
Huh?

180
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,950
Uh...I was too drunk last night.

181
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,020
I can't remember anything.

182
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,940
You can't remember anything?

183
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,070
No...I can't.

184
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,070
Oh...I see...

185
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:45,050
I went to bed early last night
because I was tired.

186
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,110
I feel asleep in Eun-Suk's room.

187
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,730
I was lost in thought in
Euk-Suk's room, and fell asleep.

188
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,910
I see!

189
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,860
I came home drunk last night.

190
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,720
When I woke up, I found myself
in the computer room!

191
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,800
So that's why you didn't see me.

192
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,860
I see!

193
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,060
You look tired.

194
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,750
You must've had a lot to drink.

195
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,760
Yes, I drank more than I should!

196
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,120
You look tired too.

197
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,840
I guess you didn't get
much sleep last night.

198
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,150
You're right.

199
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,020
I'll make you breakfast.

200
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,990
Good, I need it to relieve my hangover.

201
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,950
Gi-Suk.

202
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,980
Behave, okay?

203
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,660
Okay.

204
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,790
Bye.

205
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,680
What happened?

206
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,130
He must've thrown a fit.

207
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,930
You didn't tell him about me, right?

208
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,090
He doesn't know
that I didn't come home.

209
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,060
He was too drunk last night
and couldn't remember.

210
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,930
Good.

211
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,880
Su-Duk!

212
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,980
Are you okay?

213
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,710
Oh, no...

214
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,070
My husband threw a spoon at me.

215
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,080
He's the pitcher for the
neighborhood baseball team.

216
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm grounded now.

217
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,130
He said he'll throw the rice cooker at me if I leave home without permission.

218
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,090
What are you doing here?

219
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll be fine as long as I'm within 100m.

220
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,700
I can answer the phone
and pretend I'm home.

221
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,100
It was my idea to go to the beach.

223
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,940
I'm glad I divorced.

224
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,090
Her family must be worried about her.

225
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,940
They must be wondering
if she's dead or alive.

226
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,770
I'm sure they called the cops.

227
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,720
Is Yun-Shil back?

228
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,870
I think so.

229
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,830
Wait.

230
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,000
Hello?

231
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,950
Her husband looks like a nice person.

232
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,100
The Police took Yun-Shil's cell phone.

233
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:58,080
They said no one called her.

234
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,080
Then...why does he look so nonchalant?

235
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,710
Maybe she called.

236
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:07,820
Maybe she called her family.

237
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,900
Maybe.

238
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,850
Shall we ask her husband if she called?

239
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:13,900
What if she didn't?

240
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,870
He'll tell us to do something about it.

241
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,130
I hate getting myself into
someone else's business.

242
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,830
Are you telling us that
we should do nothing?

243
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,870
The cops told us not to talk about it.

244
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,730
If she ran away,
then what we say can wreck a home.

245
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,760
What's this?

246
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,830
Look who we have here.

247
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,090
Birds of the same feather flock together.

248
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,660
You guys split last night
without cleaning up, right?

249
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,060
Split?

250
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,740
Come on.

251
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:48,870
We're all neighbors here.

252
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,850
Let's be nice to each other.

253
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,030
I don't think of you as my neighbor.

254
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,760
Me neither.

255
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,150
Where we you last night?

256
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,110
None of you guys picked up
your interphones.

257
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,960
I don't have to tell you that.

258
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,010
You're not the Police.

259
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,890
Look at these fatheads!

260
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,810
How dare you talk back to me
when you split without cleaning up?

261
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,780
Ooh, I'm scared.

262
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,150
I know...

263
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,800
I'll clean it like you say
by the end of this week.

264
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,730
So...

265
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,700
What do you take me for?

266
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,820
Sure, I'll show you what
it means to mess with me.

267
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,790
Choi! Kim! What's with the long faces?

268
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,090
You guys look like miserable
white-collar workers.

269
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,930
You're going to get wrinkles
on your forehead.

270
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,800
Smile, life's not too bad, right?

271
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,040
Are you happy about something?

272
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,050
Can you tell?

273
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,680
Can you help me be happy, too?

274
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,770
I texted Tae-Ran,
but I heard nothing from her.

275
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,730
Help me meet up with her.

276
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,710
Hey, I was going to ask him that!

277
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,060
Don't take her from me.

278
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,870
I'm not kidding.

279
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,910
I felt a connection with Tae-Ran
when we played poker.

280
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,660
Yeah right.

281
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,060
Did you see how much Tae-Ran
laughed whenever I made a joke?

282
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,750
Thanks.

283
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,870
My father taught me to enjoy my life.

284
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,130
Let's start enjoying our lives.

285
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,660
Mr. Yeom!

286
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,840
Yes?

287
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,880
Just between us, you're a master
when it comes to one-night stands.

288
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:29,120
People will think you're
serious if they hear this.

289
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,790
It's just between us.

290
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,680
What is it?

291
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,890
What happens if she doesn't call
after a one-night stand?

292
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,150
One night stand means
it's just for one night.

293
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:56,080
You're not supposed to call
the other person the next day.

294
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,910
She left a note saying she's leaving.

295
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,000
They both know each other's numbers.

296
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
She can text him, right?

297
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,020
That means she has come to her senses.

298
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,770
She's disappointed in the guy.

299
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,780
Forget about it.

300
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,890
You're supposed to forget about one-night stands after the night is over.

301
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,000
What if she's someone I know?

302
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:34,670
That's the worst one-night stand
out of them all!

303
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,740
You'll only get yourself embarrassed
and lose a friend!

304
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,930
You have nothing to gain!

305
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:45,990
Don't worry.

306
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,870
Just take it one step at a time.

307
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,750
If you want to continue the relationship, you can be her boyfriend.

308
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,730
If you regret what you've done...

309
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,690
...forget about the one-night stand and pretend as if nothing has happened.

310
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,130
I guess I had too much to drink...

311
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,130
Tears aren't the only things
a man shouldn't spill.

312
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,820
I'm getting the memorial dishes from your brother's house.

313
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,780
Can you come and help me carry them?

314
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,040
We should've taken
them a long time ago.

315
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,030
Thanks for taking care of them.

316
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,890
You're welcome.

317
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,670
I'm busy.

318
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,850
Sheesh...

319
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,690
Myung-Pil, I'm at a cafe
near your workplace.

320
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,730
Yes!

321
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,150
Persistence is the key.

322
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,800
I called after getting tired of texting.

323
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,960
She answered the phone!

324
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,990
I was having an interview
nearby when he called.

325
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,130
What's this?

326
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,700
She's too nonchalant.

327
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,780
And I'm sure you know that
love is all about timing.

328
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,110
You should be a writer.

329
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,080
It'll be a waste to use your lines
for hitting on girls only.

330
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,660
What?

331
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Maybe she doesn't remember.

332
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,050
Myung-Pil, stop him!

333
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,710
Huh? Okay...

334
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,950
If you regret what you've done, forget about the one-night stand and...

335
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,690
...pretend as of nothing has happened.

336
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:45,970
Choi!

337
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,860
What do you think you're doing?

338
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,860
How many good articles
have you written lately?

339
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,950
Myung-Pil...

340
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,680
Now's not the time to hit on her!

341
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,910
Now's the time to! Get coffee.

342
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,090
I'll go and get coffee!

343
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,730
Tae-Ran...

344
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,900
We drank a lot last night.

345
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,910
I haven't been that drunk
in about 10 years.

346
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,090
I must've been a handful.

347
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,670
Thanks.

348
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,790
Were you that drunk?

349
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,060
You don't remember anything?

350
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,970
I was really drunk.

351
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,060
You were drunk too.

352
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,920
We were drunk!

353
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,890
We were both drunk!

354
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,140
We were really drunk!

355
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:52,740
I wasn't drunk.

356
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,870
I remember everything.

357
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:01,130
Actually, I enjoyed it.

358
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,660
Yes!

359
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,890
I'm back!

360
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:29,150
Do you remember
Myung-Pil's friend Ji-Hoon?

361
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:37,780
He's moving into a huge
apartment in a rich neighborhood.

362
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:51,840
He never beat Myung-Pil in anything, except for marrying into a rich family.

363
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,860
Myung-Pil will be upset
if he hears that Ji-Hoon bought a home.

364
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,780
Don't tell him.

365
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,850
Excuse me, can you
drop me off over there?

366
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,750
Why?

367
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,150
Why don't we go out for dinner tonight?

368
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,980
I'll tell Myung-Pil to come home early.

369
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,690
Why?

370
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,890
You had a tough day yesterday
because of the house.

371
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:32,910
I'm not okay with it either,
but we have no choice.

372
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,710
We have to start working hard again.

373
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:36,120
So...

374
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,660
Okay.

375
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,690
Go home.

376
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,090
Bye!

377
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:45,700
Don't tell him.

378
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,760
It's me, Tae-Ran.

379
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,020
Where are you?

380
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,880
I don't have anywhere else
to go but my workroom.

381
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,670
'Tis a shame for a beautiful
woman like my Tae-Ran...

382
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:11,090
...to waste her day in a workroom.

383
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,690
The phone...

384
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:18,790
Hello?

385
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,020
Hello, Guk-Hee.

386
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:27,720
But it's very encouraging to see how you're using your talent to benefit...

387
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
...the movie industry.

388
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,010
I'll bring some snacks
to cheer you up tonight.

389
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,710
Bye.

390
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,840
Your wife wants you to come home
early to have dinner with your mom.

391
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,690
Go home, your mom's waiting for you.

392
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,970
Geez...

393
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,910
Geez...

394
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,760
Myung-Pil...

395
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,680
...let me give you some advice.

396
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,880
Stop it. Don't start.

397
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,890
You should be thankful for
the wife who takes cares of you.

398
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,830
You'll be punished if you
hurt a woman like that.

399
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,100
Your wife's an acupuncturist,
and my wife is a housewife.

400
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,880
Are you mocking me?

401
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,750
You always have one-night stands.

402
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,080
What a hypocrite.

403
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,830
I only do one-night stands,
but you're starting a relationship.

404
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,970
Do you think you can wreck your home?

405
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,130
I know a thing or two about you.

406
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,850
You'll want more.

407
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,700
That's why I'm giving you this advice.

408
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:15,030
Just do one-night stands, like I do.

409
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,150
Yes, Honey.

410
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,770
Your mom's coming too.

411
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,050
Fine! Fine!

412
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,730
I'm coming!

413
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,810
Why are you so irritated?

414
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,040
Is it because of the house?

415
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,930
Why do you want to have dinner today?

416
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,790
Why tonight?

417
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,950
You're the biggest
stumbling block in my life.

418
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,690
Yes! I'm coming!

419
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,690
Do you have a problem with that?

420
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,990
Nam Jang-Mi?

421
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,820
That divorcee came to the station?

422
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,830
Yes, Aunt.

423
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,810
She's the woman I saw at the villa.

424
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,700
Why was she at the police station?

425
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,750
I don't know...

426
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,870
Good evening!

427
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,970
I'm Min Seung-Gi,
a promising young officer.

428
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,870
I found out why Nam Jang-Mi
was at the station!

429
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,940
She was a witness to the case transferred from the Sokcho station.

430
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,040
Sokcho?

431
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,680
They went to Sokcho?

432
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,770
Bye.

433
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,740
The food here tastes great, doesn't it?

434
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,680
This is good.

435
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,940
Myung-Pil, dig in.

436
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,150
Okay.

437
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,700
What happened to the house
was tough for me too...

438
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,990
...but I'm sure we'll pull through.

439
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,990
We've saved up a lot already.

440
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,900
I'm sure we can save more.

441
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,710
By the way, maybe I should work
at the market on Sundays too.

442
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,690
They'll pay me twice as much
if I work on Sundays.

443
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,140
Then... who's going to
baby-sit on Sundays?

444
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,890
You should let Myung-Pil
rest on Sundays.

445
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,750
Don't make him baby-sit.

446
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,140
What kind of a plan is that?

447
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,780
Oh, the landlord said she's only going to increase our deposit by $30,000 more.

448
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,010
She gave us a $7,000 discount.

449
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,090
Good for you.

450
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,810
Why don't we just drop the subject?

451
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,990
Let Myung-Pil eat in peace.

452
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,860
You're right, let's not think about this.

453
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,900
I'll work harder.

454
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,070
We'll buy a house in 2 years.

455
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,820
And when we do,
let's live together.

456
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,730
Sounds good.

457
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,680
Try some of this.

458
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,100
Honey, eat.

459
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:15,150
I need to use the restroom.

460
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,030
Jang-Mi?

461
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,010
What? The Police called?

462
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,910
Did they find Yun-Shil?

463
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:33,780
No, they want me to confirm
the pervert I saw at the beach.

464
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,700
I was there during the day too.

465
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,770
I don't want to go again.

466
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,150
What should I do?

467
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:44,950
I have to stay here.

468
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,820
My husband doesn't know
what happened.

469
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:51,660
Come to my place when you
get back from the station.

470
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,000
Tell me what happened.

471
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,940
Bye.

472
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,080
Hello? Hello?

473
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,130
Are you expecting a phone call?

474
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,750
I waited for the taxi service to call! Satisfied?

475
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,770
Aren't you two going to eat?

476
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,680
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

477
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,750
Hi.

478
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,110
The fruit punch is good.

479
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,930
Myung-Pil's sister will love it.

480
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:33,890
The rice punch I made for you
doesn't have any sugar.

481
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,060
Attention, everyone.

482
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,910
I have two announcements to make.

483
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:42,700
First, we're not going to discuss remodeling our villa anymore.

484
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:48,800
Remodeling? That's for
the homeowners to worry about.

485
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:57,740
The second one is about the women
who threw away their trash illegally.

486
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm sure you are all aware they were punished with cleaning up the trash bin.

487
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:06,790
But these 4 housewives
instead went to the beach...

488
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,140
...and didn't come home that night.

489
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:18,890
I ask the other residents
to please refrain yourselves...

490
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:21,670
...from embarrassing the
other good residents here.

491
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,740
This was your head of the
neighborhood association speaking.

492
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:33,680
Is she talking about you?

493
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,810
You didn't come home last night?

494
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,910
Did you go to the beach?

495
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,730
You didn't come home?

496
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,050
Oh, my...

497
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,950
I had a good reason.

498
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,110
You see...

499
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,870
We just went there
for some fresh air, but...

500
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,750
You didn't come home?

501
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,670
Does this mean you were
on your way home...

502
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,800
...when you met me
in front of the house?

503
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,060
How can you dare leave your kids
home and stay out for the night?

504
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,940
The end is near.

505
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,880
Oh, Lord...

506
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,790
You must be out of your mind!

507
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:20,800
You're crazy!

508
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,990
How embarrassing!

509
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

510
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,150
I'm sorry, Honey.

511
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,790
I only wanted some fresh air.

512
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,800
I wasn't planning on spending the night.

513
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,150
Let's go.

514
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,840
I'll explain everything at home.

515
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,020
I don't want to hear it!

516
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,780
Not even your husband
stays out for the night!

517
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,920
Everyone's good at something.

518
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:51,050
I guess you're good
at ditching your family!

519
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,790
This is so embarrassing.

520
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,920
I don't think I can come back
to this neighborhood again.

521
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,870
Mother...

522
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,900
Mom...

523
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,140
How can you...

524
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,680
Honey...

525
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,990
Honey!

526
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,140
You're already giving me
enough trouble as it is.

527
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,670
And now this?

528
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,720
Yesterday was a tough day for me to.

529
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,970
Tough?

530
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,660
I worked hard to make
money for my family...

531
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,850
...but my wife screwed up
and lost a house!

532
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:32,050
How about me?

533
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,850
Why did you go to the beach?

534
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,040
A woman doesn't have a reason
not to come home.

535
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Okay, I'm sorry.

536
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,730
You know what camels are, right?

537
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,940
Do you know how camels can
withstand the desert for a week?

538
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,710
They can store 100 liters of water
in less than 10 minutes.

539
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,990
That's what keeps them alive.

540
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:59,150
Do you know where you get
your 100 liters of water?

541
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,970
It's me!

542
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,960
I'm the one who teaches you
and scolds you!

543
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:06,680
This is what gets me!

544
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Why do I always have to be
disappointed and mad at you?

545
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,830
I'm sorry.

546
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,740
Be quiet!

547
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,910
Tae-Ran, I'm so frustrated.

548
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,920
What's wrong?

549
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,710
What happened?

550
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,990
Do you want to meet up?

551
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:06,800
Honey...

552
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,870
Honey, where are you going?

553
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,740
Here, is this the man?

554
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:35,720
Yes, he's the pervert I saw at the beach.

555
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:39,040
That's odd.

556
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,930
He doesn't have anything to do
with Lee Yun-Shil.

557
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,820
He was caught drunk driving.

558
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,690
He's been at the station
ever since he was arrested at 2am.

559
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,780
Lee Yun-Shil was missing since 4am.

560
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,960
Are you okay?

561
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,940
Are you sick?

562
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,730
What 's wrong with my life, Tae-Ran?

563
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,890
Everyday is a battle.

564
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:54,040
Think of how tough it is
for a weakling like me.

565
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,780
What's wrong?

566
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,810
You seem to be having
a lot of trouble too.

567
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,700
I get depressed whenever I stay
in that workroom by myself.

568
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,990
Looking out the window...

569
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,850
...made me think about the people...

570
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:15,750
...who committed suicide
out of loneliness out of loneliness.

571
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,980
My eyes started watering up.

572
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,050
Your husband left?

573
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,020
It's because of the neighborhood association lady, right?

574
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,140
I can't believe she announced that!

575
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,970
She has a family too.

576
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:52,660
Oh, and about Yun-Shil.

577
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:55,030
He said it's probably not a criminal case.

578
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,680
He wants us to wait.

579
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,020
I'm sorry for making you go
to the station by yourself.

580
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,990
I don't know what's wrong with my life.

581
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,970
It's one battle after another.

582
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,760
Honey...

583
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,970
Honey...

584
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,080
I'm tired.

585
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,150
I don't want to talk.

586
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:14,730
I'm sorry about not coming home
last night, but I had a reason.

587
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,120
I heard your conversation with Tae-Ran.

588
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:23,070
You told her that you should've
married her instead.

589
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:30,780
I'm trying to be a good wife.

590
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,860
I'm not always smiling
because I'm happy.

591
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,880
It's tough for me too, but I'm trying
to act cheerful for my family's sake.

592
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,710
How can you say that to me?

593
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,020
I couldn't help myself
after hearing that, so I left.

594
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,150
I just left.

595
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,130
If I didn't...I thought
my head would burst.

596
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,710
It was because of Tae-Ran?

597
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,900
Did you get Botox on your brain again?

598
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,670
I told you to use your brain!

599
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:12,770
Why do you think I said that to Tae-Ran?

600
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,030
I only said it because
she's better than you are.

601
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,720
She bought two houses,
but you lost a house.

602
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:24,050
Don't make me feed the need
to say something like that!

603
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,040
Just become a better woman
than Tae-Ran is!

604
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:30,120
How can you say that?

605
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,020
Because she's better than you!

606
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,740
Because it's true!

607
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:38,730
A good wife?
And a good mother?

608
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,070
Not everyone can be a good wife!

609
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,880
Especially if you don't
come home for the night!

610
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,840
You're not qualified to be a good wife!

611
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,120
Those pathetic women
are all disqualified!

612
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,130
All of them!

613
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,760
Don't ever hang out with those
pathetic women again, okay?

614
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,950
I'm not going to talk to you
if I see you with them again!

615
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,710
Got that?

616
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,800
Got it.

617
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,080
Your wisdom tooth will
hurt more under stress.

618
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,980
You're stressed out because
you fought with your husband.

619
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:47,770
Honey, it's me.

620
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,790
Don't skip lunch...

621
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,070
Jang-Mi?

622
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,000
Is Yun-Shil's husband back yet?

623
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,720
There he is.

624
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,930
You didn't have to come.

625
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,700
I heard what happened from the Police.

626
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,870
Oh, so you heard.

627
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:47,790
You must've been shocked.

628
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,110
She'll be fine.

629
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,990
I think she decided to go on a trip
after a visit to the beach.

630
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,960
People sometimes want
to get away from everything.

631
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,760
I'm sure she'll call soon.

632
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,090
You're not even mad.

633
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,860
I was expecting you to yell at us.

634
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:06,060
Why would I be mad?

635
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,030
My wife always talked about
how much she misses the beach.

636
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,720
Let's wait for her.

637
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,100
Good things happen to people
who think positively.

638
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:17,870
You know that, right?

639
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,880
Yun-Shil is so lucky.

640
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,100
He's a gentleman.

641
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,810
What's wrong?

642
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,730
Well...

643
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,890
I don't think he's a good person.

644
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,070
Look at his pants.

645
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,120
He's wearing white linen
pants on a rainy day.

646
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,960
Those pants will be ruined.

647
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,850
You're right.

648
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:52,750
He's stylish.

649
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:57,680
Yun-Shil has two kids and
works at a bank, right?

650
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,000
She must've been busy working
and taking care of her kids...

651
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,860
...and her stylish husband.

652
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:08,870
All families give the woman a hard time.

653
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:32,680
She must be a good friend.

654
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,940
You're very concerned about her article.

655
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,010
She's my friend,
but she's good enough to be...

656
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:41,830
...one of the 10 best writers
in Korean cinema.

657
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,050
If you write a good article about her...

658
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:46,720
...I'll arrange an interview with
Yoon Jenma for you.

659
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,760
Really?

660
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,060
That's a promise!

661
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:04,740
Don't wear knockoffs.

662
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,900
You should wear designer's clothing.

663
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,690
I'm only going to buy you the real stuff.

664
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:13,920
I don't mind knockoffs
as long as they're from you.

665
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,930
Let's sit down.

666
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:29,020
Why don't we go on a trip when
you're done with the screenplay?

667
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,700
Just the two of us.

668
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:32,790
Sounds great.

669
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:37,750
But I don't know when I'll be done.

670
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:39,940
Do you have writer's block?

671
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,020
This is driving me crazy.

672
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,710
All I need is a lead,
but I can't seem to find it.

673
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:50,960
Why don't you work somewhere else?

674
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,950
It'll help if you change your setting.

675
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:56,990
Why don't you go to Yangpyeong?

676
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:58,670
You can rent a cottage.

677
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,080
A cottage by myself?

678
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,750
Sounds horrible.

679
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,150
You won't be alone.

680
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,710
I'll be with you.

681
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,960
Do you want to go today?

682
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,740
Let's look for a good cottage
for you to write in.

683
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:10,800
Really?

684
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,150
Hello?

685
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,880
The police station?

686
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,870
I hope they found Yun-Shil.

687
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:36,920
I hope so too.

688
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,820
I don't believe this.

689
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,720
How many times do I have
to go to the police station?

690
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,020
I hate getting myself into
someone else's business.

691
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:49,120
Are you going to the station?

692
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,710
Get in, I'm going to the station too.

693
00:50:57,970 --> 00:51:00,860
I don't believe this.

694
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,680
What's the matter?

695
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,720
She called in the afternoon.

696
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,000
She's nonchalant about everything.

697
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,950
Where did she go?

698
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,730
Why did she leave?

699
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:12,970
She's at a friend's house.

700
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,890
She said she'll be home in a few days.

701
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,860
She said she just felt like leaving.

702
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,790
I'm beginning to hate her.

703
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:22,740
We were worried sick about her!

704
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,090
I know...

705
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,040
Don't leave anything behind.

706
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,710
Okay.

707
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,050
Why aren't you getting off?

708
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,070
Oh...

709
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:53,750
Most missing people
end up being runaways.

710
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,670
I'm glad nothing bad happened to her.

711
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:00,130
I told you that nothing bad will happen.

712
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,050
I don't want to take to Yun-Shil anymore.

713
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:06,030
We got ourselves into
this mess for nothing.

714
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,910
Maybe she ran away because
she didn't want to clean the trash bin!

715
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,090
Maybe that's why.

716
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,820
Don't you think so too?

717
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:12,910
Huh?

718
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,130
Yeah...

719
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:27,980
As soon as we verify the husband's call, the Sokcho station will close the case.

720
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,930
Can you verify it right now?

721
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:33,720
It'll take a few hours.

722
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,020
Call me if she comes home
before we're done.

723
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,060
Okay.

724
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,780
Hi! Are you done?

725
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:53,000
What are you doing here?

726
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,080
This is my sister.

727
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,130
She was worried about
Yun-Shil the whole day.

728
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:04,070
Get in, I'll drive you home.

729
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,780
Thank you for coming on a rainy day.

730
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,930
Thank you.

731
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:37,920
Let's go and get some food for the kids.

732
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,780
Is there a way to erase my phone number from the police files?

733
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:49,780
Who are you trying to hide from?

734
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,790
No, I'm doing this because I'm
too popular with my good looks.

735
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,860
Anyways, thank goodness it's over.

736
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,150
I'm never going to the beach again.

737
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,800
Bye.

738
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:08,720
Wait, hold on... I have something
to tell you... hold on.

739
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:12,800
What's the matter?

740
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,860
Look...

741
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,130
What's this?

742
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,000
Blood!

743
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:23,900
Get it off me!

744
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,800
I'm scared of blood!

745
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,940
Did you get hurt?

746
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,060
It's not mine.

747
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,000
It's from the white pants
on a rainy day's car.

748
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,690
White pants on a rainy day?

749
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,790
Yun-Shil's husband.

750
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,850
Doesn't this look like the scarf
Yun-Shil had on at the beach?

751
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,100
Don't you remember?

752
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,150
No way...

753
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:48,760
I think she had a scarf on...

754
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,870
Stop it, you're scaring Su-Duk.

755
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:56,870
I'm positive she had this scarf on.

756
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,970
You're right!

757
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,120
This is hers!

758
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,830
You're scaring me!

759
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,820
Why is there blood on this?

760
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,950
Why is this in the white pants' car?

761
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:11,790
It's the white pants!

762
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,670
Look at white pants!

763
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:30,860
That's the woman we just saw!

764
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,730
I thought she was his sister!

765
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,800
Why did he kiss his sister?

766
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,870
She's not his sister.

767
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,810
Where are you guys going?

768
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:47,770
Wait! Wait!

769
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,000
I thought you said she's your sister.

770
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,970
Ma'am, please don't meddle
in someone else's affairs.

771
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:00,720
I'm sure you're preoccupied with just taking care of your own family.

772
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,680
Carry on.

773
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,110
I'll be on my way.

774
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,000
Wait!

775
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,150
Yes?

776
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:13,720
Are you sure you talked to Yun-Shil?

777
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,710
Did she really call?

778
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,690
Tell me the truth.

779
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:18,910
Yes.

780
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:41,120
Just pretend you didn't see that.

781
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,060
I don't like meddling in
someone else's business.

782
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,090
What about this?

783
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:48,010
Do you want to disregard this too?

784
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:48,940
Yes.

785
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,830
Let's disregard it.

786
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:51,830
I don't like being scared.

787
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:53,760
Su-Duk has a weak heart.

788
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,750
What if this really is Yun-Shil's blood?

789
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,090
What if she's in danger? We can't just act as if nothing happened!

790
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,970
You're right.

791
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,760
I'm scared.

792
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,830
Fine, do whatever you want.

793
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:05,660
Just leave me out.

794
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,150
That's none of my business.

795
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:10,720
Maybe it's a pig's blood or just red paint.

796
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,860
I don't care if white pants
kissed his sister or a pig.

797
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:18,800
I don't know anyone from this neighborhood anyway.

798
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,780
I want to keep it that way.

799
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,970
Same here.

800
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,790
You're right.

801
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,030
We shouldn't get ourselves involved.

802
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,930
If she's in danger,
then her husband should help her.

803
00:57:31,930 --> 00:57:34,840
Yes, but look,

804
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,830
He doesn't seem worried at all.

805
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,090
He's even cheating on her.

806
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:43,960
If Yun-Shil really is in danger,
who's going to help her?

807
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,800
She's by herself.

808
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:54,690
Right this way.

809
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:55,920
That's the master bedroom, right?

810
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,860
Call me if you need anything.

811
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:00,680
Okay.

812
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:01,660
Thank you.

813
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,740
Goodnight.

814
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:24,770
Myung-Pil!

815
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,150
Again?

816
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:27,810
Myung-Pil...

817
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,000
Tae-ran!

818
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,120
Myung-Pil! Myung-Pil!

819
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,140
Get the phone!

820
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:34,070
No!

821
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:36,880
Get the phone! Now!

822
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,800
Hello?

823
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,890
Yes, this is Hur Myung-Pil.

824
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,040
The Police?

825
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,840
How can you do this to me?

826
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,050
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

827
00:59:00,050 --> 00:59:01,850
This is too much for me to handle.

828
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:03,850
What about this scarf?

829
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,750
Tell me why this scarf
was found in your car.

830
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,770
How many times do I have to tell you?

831
00:59:12,770 --> 00:59:14,710
I've never seen that before!

832
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,810
Are you sure you found this in his car?

833
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,800
Yes.

834
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,090
I'm sure.

835
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:41,140
I found this on the back seat floor.

836
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:47,030
Look I can get you
imprisoned for slandering!

837
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,830
Don't you have anyone to verify
where you were that night?

838
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:55,930
I slept at home!

839
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,080
How can I prove that I went to bed?

840
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:02,730
You're going to regret
that you did this to me.

841
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,840
And you!

842
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,690
I found a lawyer.

843
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:15,800
Get ready to go to jail.

844
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,110
Calm down...

845
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,150
The file's here.

846
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:29,860
Seoul 02TA8025.

847
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,090
Is that your license plate number?

848
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,730
Yes.

849
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,720
You went to Sokcho
on the day of the case!

850
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,780
You were caught on speed camera.

851
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,850
Sokcho...

852
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,680
That's where we went.

853
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:48,000
Excuse me sir...

854
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,670
This man... This man,
there's something fishy about him.

855
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,800
He's even cheating on his wife.

856
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,970
I even saw them kiss.

857
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,830
You saw that too, right?

858
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,710
Look here!

859
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,750
What was your name again?

860
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,780
Gyung Guk-Hee?

861
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:06,000
Okay, Gyung-Guk-Hee!

862
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,850
Why can't you arrest someone
on the spot for slandering?

863
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:11,050
Gyung Guk-Hee! I'm going to
throw you in prison!

864
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:11,830
Understand?

865
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:12,710
Sit down.

866
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:13,810
What's going on?

867
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:20,660
I'm a reporter for Joongdong Daily.

868
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,930
I'm also her husband.

869
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:30,930
Honey, listen to me.

870
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:31,930
Be quiet!

871
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,080
Why won't you listen to me?

872
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:37,840
Be quiet and come with me!

873
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,880
Just hear me out!

874
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,740
Listen to me for once, will you?

875
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,740
Let me explain why I'm doing this.

876
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,150
Something horrible is going on!

877
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,120
Be quiet!

878
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,710
Ouch...

879
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,710
Come on...

880
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,950
Ow, that hurts!

881
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,940
Guk-Hee, are you okay?

882
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,670
Who is he?

883
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,870
You and your friends always
get stuck with scoundrels like him...

884
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,790
...whenever you go.

885
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,970
I got a phone call to
come in for the missing girl.

886
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,740
Honey, are you okay?

887
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,660
Honey?

888
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:16,750
You have a husband?

889
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,930
Who are you?

890
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,070
Oh...

891
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,710
I'm... Guk-Hee's friend.

892
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,370
What?

893
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:31,080
Friend?

894
01:02:32,850 --> 01:03:41,070

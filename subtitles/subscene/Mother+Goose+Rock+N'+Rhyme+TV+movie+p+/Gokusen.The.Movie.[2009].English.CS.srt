"Narita International Airport"

3
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:06,168
On its way from Hong Kong to Tokyo,

4
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:08,364
First Airline flight 816

5
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:12,672
was hijacked before landing in Narita Airport.

6
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:17,350
No demand except for a ramp
has been made by the hijackers...

7
00:01:17,517 --> 00:01:20,315
They may be armed with guns.

8
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:23,217
The passengers' safety is of the greatest concern.

9
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,614
What's their demand?

10
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,728
20 million dollars and a getaway plane.

11
00:01:28,995 --> 00:01:31,156
We won't accept.

12
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:35,596
Should we send in the SWAT team?

13
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:41,139
Not yet. We'll use them as our last resort.

14
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,101
They're taking too long.

15
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,673
We'll wait 5 more minutes.

16
00:01:48,014 --> 00:01:49,914
Stop screwing with us!

17
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:56,217
Our vacation abroad...

18
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:59,757
It was a bad idea.

19
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:03,490
At any rate...

20
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:08,426
How can she stay asleep?

21
00:02:13,773 --> 00:02:15,570
I slept so well.

22
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:18,405
Are we landing soon?

23
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:22,945
Keep your voice down.

24
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:28,787
Quiet!

25
00:02:29,956 --> 00:02:31,184
Yes.

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,621
Hijack?

27
00:02:38,031 --> 00:02:39,794
When did this happen?

28
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:43,127
Can I have some water?

29
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:46,103
Shut your mouth, hag!

30
00:02:47,107 --> 00:02:48,904
Hag?

31
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,938
What's that look?

32
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:54,678
Sit still and behave, geezer.

33
00:02:58,218 --> 00:03:00,846
Unforgivable.

34
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,217
You all behave.

35
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,655
Miss Yamaguchi!

36
00:03:07,861 --> 00:03:11,092
They're people who deserve respect

37
00:03:11,264 --> 00:03:14,256
for their decades of hard work.

38
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,458
How dare you dis them.

39
00:03:17,904 --> 00:03:19,428
What'd you say?

40
00:03:21,241 --> 00:03:23,436
Whatever it is you want,

41
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:27,770
face the sun and

42
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:30,379
say it with pride and dignity.

43
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,848
Stop blabbering!

44
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:41,788
Move in!

45
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,489
There was a gunshot.

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,697
The hijackers did have guns.

47
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,701
Forgive us!

48
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,410
Huh?

49
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:49,585
Miss Yamaguchi?

50
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:53,864
- What?
- Look!

51
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:55,159
You're kidding!

52
00:04:58,138 --> 00:04:59,070
Miss Yamaguchi?!

53
00:04:59,205 --> 00:05:00,399
Yankumi...

54
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:03,136
My Lady...

55
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:04,504
Kumiko...

56
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,512
My Lady's in trouble!

57
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,614
You guys, let's go!

58
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:17,456
We're going.

59
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:24,126
It's over.

60
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,000
No... I'm not the criminal.

61
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:33,432
I'm straight.

62
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,873
Straight?

63
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,841
Straight?

64
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:46,885
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi.

65
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,146
A teacher at Akado High School.

66
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,220
I teach math.

67
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,917
My nickname is Yankumi.

68
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:57,619
By the way, I'm single.

69
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:35,195
GOKUSEN THE MOVIE

70
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,704
"The Oedo Family"

71
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,834
I'm glad you're okay.

72
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,342
It was reckless of you.

73
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:51,378
I'm sorry to worry you.

74
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:55,043
But we were impressed.

75
00:06:55,221 --> 00:07:00,181
Guts and honor befitting
the 4th generation head.

76
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,893
You can take over any day.

77
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:06,696
My Lady!
No..."Lady Boss"!

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,298
Sounds nice.

79
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:18,869
You guys, follow my lead.

80
00:07:20,947 --> 00:07:23,575
"The Oedo Family"

81
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,913
No way. I'm not taking over.

82
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:32,421
I bought souvenirs for you.

83
00:07:33,893 --> 00:07:37,226
You didn't have to do that.

84
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:48,697
Oops... They're at the airport.

85
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,917
Sorry.

86
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:09,794
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi,
a high school teacher.

87
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,464
I lost my parents at age 7

88
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:16,397
and was raised by my grandfather,
Ryuichiro Kuroda,

89
00:08:16,602 --> 00:08:20,231
the 3rd generation head of the Oedo Family.

90
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,636
I've been a teacher for 7 years.

91
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:29,440
My students always happen
to be so-called delinquents.

92
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:33,276
But they taught me things.

93
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:38,116
Face them squarely and they'll do the same.

94
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:41,759
You can see eye to eye.

95
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:46,195
In 7 years, I've grown thanks to my students.

96
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:51,360
Good morning, Yankumi.

97
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:53,101
Good morning, Kuma.

98
00:08:53,272 --> 00:08:56,241
I saw you on the news yesterday.

99
00:08:56,442 --> 00:09:00,344
No big deal. I wasn't afraid of them.

100
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:03,708
You were cool.

101
00:09:03,916 --> 00:09:05,474
No compliments.

102
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,515
It's embarrassing.

103
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:09,882
See ya.

104
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,336
"Hijackers surrender themselves"

105
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:28,096
"Hijackers arrested"

106
00:09:28,341 --> 00:09:32,175
I didn't know this was your flight.

107
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,643
I was shocked when I saw the news.

108
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:36,008
Thank goodness you're safe.

109
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:41,051
It was terrifying.
Miss Ayukawa is still in shock.

110
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,654
I'm gonna die...

111
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,519
A hijack...

112
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,386
Help me.

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:50,757
So why did the hijackers surrender themselves?

114
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:54,296
Well, Miss Yamaguchi...

115
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:59,529
They knew they couldn't get away.

116
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,162
Miss Yamaguchi.

117
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:03,172
Good morning, Vice Principal.

118
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:04,400
Principal.

119
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:06,602
Oh... sorry.

120
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:07,837
May I?

121
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,416
"Passenger scolds hijackers?"

122
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:14,884
Was it you?

123
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:17,113
No.

124
00:10:17,323 --> 00:10:18,551
Good.

125
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:22,956
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

126
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:27,232
Don't forget.
I've told you many times.

127
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:29,061
We'll both be fired.

128
00:10:29,302 --> 00:10:32,271
Don't attract attention to yourself.

129
00:10:33,372 --> 00:10:37,240
A trainee teacher starts today, right?

130
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,877
He's not here yet.

131
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,478
Late from day one.

132
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:45,947
He needs to be disciplined.

133
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:48,445
I'm sorry I'm late.

134
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,557
I apologize.

135
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:56,724
Odagiri!

136
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:00,425
Yankumi...

137
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,067
Odagiri!

138
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,199
Baba...

139
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,668
You're...

140
00:11:05,905 --> 00:11:08,305
That Odagiri?

141
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:11,107
Vice Principal Monkey Brain.

142
00:11:11,444 --> 00:11:14,436
Principal Sawatari.

143
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,478
Seriously?

144
00:11:16,616 --> 00:11:19,141
You know him, Miss Yamaguchi?

145
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:23,015
He was my student at Kurogin.

146
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:31,460
I'm Ryu Odagiri, the trainee teacher.
Nice to meet you.

147
00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:35,091
Let's go.

148
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,929
Good luck.

149
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,700
Welcome.

150
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,739
Give him proper guidance.

151
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:46,239
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,080
It's been a while.

153
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:57,247
You were such a handful back then.

154
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,220
But look at you now.

155
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:08,256
This was my dream.

156
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:13,599
A student admiring me

157
00:12:13,773 --> 00:12:16,970
choosing to become a teacher.

158
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:19,602
What?

159
00:12:20,913 --> 00:12:22,312
So, Odagiri...

160
00:12:22,548 --> 00:12:28,384
You and me and the students united
with passion and sweat!

161
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:31,421
Follow my lead.

162
00:12:32,391 --> 00:12:34,951
You're even more gung-ho.

163
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,694
You don't want to be a teacher?

164
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:46,166
I don't know yet.
I just took the teacher-training course.

165
00:12:47,106 --> 00:12:50,735
You're not here because I'm here?

166
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,900
Of course not.

167
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:57,443
Oh...

168
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:03,579
How're you doing with
your new troublemakers?

169
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,553
Not that well.

170
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:08,352
I'm taking it slowly.

171
00:13:08,761 --> 00:13:13,892
Teachers have to be patient
with their students.

172
00:13:14,634 --> 00:13:15,931
Join me.

173
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:23,968
You still do that?

174
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,768
Yes.

175
00:13:29,448 --> 00:13:30,938
Good morning.

176
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,050
Quiet, please.

177
00:13:36,055 --> 00:13:37,454
Quiet down.

178
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:45,597
Quiet, please.

179
00:13:49,402 --> 00:13:52,303
I told you to be quiet!

180
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:59,475
"Teachers have to be patient," right?

181
00:14:02,815 --> 00:14:05,443
What're you babbling about?

182
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:08,051
You can't boss us around!

183
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,900
Who put out a cigarette here?

184
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:30,665
So that's why.

185
00:14:30,843 --> 00:14:32,208
She was just lucky.

186
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,709
You have to use an ashtray.

187
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,745
That's not the point.

188
00:14:42,154 --> 00:14:44,714
Who was smoking?!

189
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:46,084
- I dunno

190
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:47,850
- We wouldn't tell you anyway.

191
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,392
We don't sell out our friends.

192
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:53,725
We take good care of each other.

193
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:58,094
What's funny?

194
00:14:58,304 --> 00:14:59,601
Nothing.

195
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,804
Smoking by minors is verboten.

196
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,308
Verboten?

197
00:15:05,478 --> 00:15:07,002
What's that word?

198
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:13,179
Not being caught doesn't make things okay.

199
00:15:13,352 --> 00:15:15,650
The sun's watching you.

200
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:18,246
The sun?

201
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:19,857
What does that mean?

202
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,463
Let me introduce him.

203
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:29,233
Mr. Ryu Odagiri, a trainee teacher.

204
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:33,700
To get acquainted with Mr. Odagiri,

205
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:38,536
let's play Kick the Can.

206
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:44,809
Change into your jerseys
and come to the field.

207
00:15:58,497 --> 00:16:02,558
At least we can get acquainted.

208
00:16:02,701 --> 00:16:03,668
No thanks.

209
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:08,870
Dammit!

210
00:16:14,914 --> 00:16:17,405
Uh-oh. Run!

211
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,414
Whoa...

212
00:16:20,486 --> 00:16:24,081
That trainee teacher was
Yamaguchi's student.

213
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,985
A delinquent at Kurogin.

214
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:27,557
A delinquent-turned-teacher?

215
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:29,023
No way.

216
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:42,069
Big news!

217
00:16:43,242 --> 00:16:44,800
Unbelievable!

218
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:50,072
What's going on?!

219
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,476
Listen to this!

220
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,085
What's up?

221
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:58,847
Why are you so amped up?

222
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:01,424
You see!

223
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:05,058
You see!

224
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,158
Stop talking at once.

225
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,303
Yankumi was walking with a guy.

226
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:16,907
- You guys saw them too?

227
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:17,940
- Yeah.

228
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:19,542
He was even good-looking.

229
00:17:19,712 --> 00:17:20,804
- No way.

230
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,037
- Probably an illusion.

231
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:23,375
- It was really her!

232
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:24,573
- It'll snow tomorrow!

233
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:26,241
Table for two, please.

234
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:30,349
Sit. I recommend...

235
00:17:30,522 --> 00:17:31,682
I know.

236
00:17:35,194 --> 00:17:37,424
Guys! Long time no see.

237
00:17:37,563 --> 00:17:38,723
How're you doing?

238
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,157
Why are you gaping at me?

239
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:45,660
Odagiri, it's you!

240
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:46,935
Hello.

241
00:17:47,072 --> 00:17:50,166
Ryu Odagiri, Yankumi's student
from Kurogin High.

242
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,503
Student?!

243
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:54,439
Now I understand.

244
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:57,242
So that's why...

245
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:00,712
They were worked up
because they saw you with a guy.

246
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:03,150
They thought it was an illusion.

247
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,423
Yankumi could never find
a good-looking boyfriend.

248
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,083
Never.

249
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:10,558
We were such idiots.

250
00:18:10,663 --> 00:18:12,096
Totally.

251
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:14,163
I told you "no way."

252
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,602
No way?

253
00:18:22,074 --> 00:18:24,508
You guys, outside!
Right now!

254
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,577
What do you mean...

255
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,940
Calm down.
Two ramen noodles, please.

256
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,241
"Kumai Noodle Shop"

257
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,350
Yummy!

258
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:39,724
I'm impressed.

259
00:18:39,959 --> 00:18:42,621
You're going to school regularly.

260
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,353
We try.

261
00:18:44,897 --> 00:18:47,764
You've matured since high school.

262
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,168
How's work going for you guys?

263
00:18:52,304 --> 00:18:53,532
Just great.

264
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:56,197
Kura's always getting in trouble.

265
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,172
Don't tell.

266
00:18:58,344 --> 00:19:04,613
I get in trouble with my dad at our tofu shop.

267
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:08,115
Work is tough, no matter what it is.

268
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,485
I wish they'd pay me more.

269
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:14,649
Yeah. That's why I'm getting a night job.

270
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:18,790
A night job?

271
00:19:22,034 --> 00:19:25,299
You idiot! A delivery job.

272
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:26,731
Oh.

273
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:30,969
I thought the shady type.

274
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:33,569
Of course not.

275
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,374
What shady type?

276
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:40,678
You still having a hard time with your class?

277
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,017
Sort of.

278
00:19:43,255 --> 00:19:45,746
We rejected her at first too.

279
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,586
Yeah, her lectures were awful.

280
00:19:48,761 --> 00:19:50,661
So annoying at first.

281
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:52,728
We bet on when she'd quit.

282
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,263
We did too.

283
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,902
Really? How about you?

284
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,833
Probably.

285
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,670
Everyone's the same.

286
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,037
Yep.

287
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:17,855
Are you crying?

288
00:20:18,924 --> 00:20:21,415
No, you idiot.

289
00:20:23,695 --> 00:20:25,356
I'm happy.

290
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:33,327
My students from
different schools are here...

291
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,331
Laughing together...

292
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:42,506
Real happy.

293
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:47,107
I'm glad I became a teacher.

294
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,524
Wipe them.

295
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,228
Eat as much as you want.

296
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,964
Order anything. It's my treat.

297
00:21:09,408 --> 00:21:11,035
Roasted pork noodles!

298
00:21:11,176 --> 00:21:12,700
Dumplings, large portion!

299
00:21:12,845 --> 00:21:13,834
Sounds good.

300
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,775
Large fried rice!

301
00:21:15,981 --> 00:21:17,710
Kuma, bring them all.

302
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:20,044
It's before payday, isn't it?

303
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:29,654
No large portions. No roasted pork.

304
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:32,057
Cancel the dumplings.

305
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:35,794
Just more noodles, okay?

306
00:21:36,368 --> 00:21:37,960
More noodles for six.

307
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,037
No way!

308
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,840
Reita's late.

309
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:49,342
He'll be here soon.

310
00:21:49,748 --> 00:21:54,879
Yo, can I borrow some money?

311
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,180
Don't have any.

312
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:58,551
Shut up and hand it over.

313
00:22:04,763 --> 00:22:06,025
Reita!

314
00:22:06,365 --> 00:22:08,595
Keep your hands off my friends.

315
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:12,337
Who are you?!

316
00:22:14,907 --> 00:22:20,038
Reita Takasugi of Akado.
Got a problem?

317
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:30,154
It was my dream to drink
with a student of mine.

318
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,151
Don't be shy, brother.

319
00:22:33,492 --> 00:22:34,516
Brother?

320
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,560
He means "friend."

321
00:22:36,728 --> 00:22:39,925
Wonderful, isn't it?

322
00:22:40,032 --> 00:22:43,229
A student, now a responsible adult.

323
00:22:44,203 --> 00:22:48,196
It means you taught him well.

324
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:50,238
That's not true.

325
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,103
I know.

326
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,512
What'd you say?

327
00:22:59,151 --> 00:23:00,880
Tetsu, sit.

328
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,412
Certainly.

329
00:23:05,257 --> 00:23:06,121
Scary.

330
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:09,159
You had the brains, Odagiri.

331
00:23:09,294 --> 00:23:10,761
- Minoru.
- Sorry.

332
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:15,958
Be prepared.

333
00:23:16,468 --> 00:23:18,493
Drink 'til you drop.

334
00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:28,537
That's My Lady.

335
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:37,448
"Be prepared" huh...

336
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:41,056
She must've been so happy.

337
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:51,426
Her student finding his own path.

338
00:23:53,438 --> 00:23:55,303
I haven't found mine yet.

339
00:23:59,444 --> 00:24:01,207
Gonna be a teacher, right?

340
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:05,877
No...

341
00:24:10,756 --> 00:24:12,621
I thought I could

342
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:18,359
find my path in college but I couldn't.

343
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:25,494
So I started to panic.

344
00:24:28,774 --> 00:24:32,835
Then I remembered what she said.

345
00:24:36,214 --> 00:24:37,738
"Don't give up."

346
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,878
"It's okay to fail."

347
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,857
She was sort of annoying
but taught me many things.

348
00:24:55,334 --> 00:25:01,170
She puts her heart and soul into everything.

349
00:25:06,945 --> 00:25:11,973
I want to find my own path like her.

350
00:25:29,534 --> 00:25:31,502
My head hurts.

351
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:34,995
I'm gonna throw up.

352
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:40,044
- Excuse me.
- Me too.

353
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:49,479
Yankumi!

354
00:25:49,654 --> 00:25:51,417
Takeda! Hyuga!

355
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:54,422
Long time no see.

356
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,118
How're you doing?

357
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,164
You two working hard?

358
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:02,562
Of course. Dumb question.

359
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:04,896
Look at me, a businessman.

360
00:26:05,303 --> 00:26:10,331
What are you doing here?

361
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:12,674
Listening to his speech.

362
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:15,075
Thank you for your time.

363
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:21,541
I've decided to run for
a seat in the Lower House.

364
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:23,978
My name is Kentaro Kurose.

365
00:26:24,623 --> 00:26:27,091
Who is he?

366
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:33,164
You don't know? The president of
Dream Associates, an IT giant.

367
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:35,932
He's amazing.

368
00:26:36,234 --> 00:26:39,931
A former delinquent like us
who succeeded in business.

369
00:26:40,105 --> 00:26:41,766
Now he'll be in the election.

370
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,704
Impressive.

371
00:26:44,876 --> 00:26:46,810
Yeah, he is.

372
00:26:47,612 --> 00:26:53,175
Today I'm a success in the IT industry

373
00:26:53,351 --> 00:26:56,912
but I used to be a troublemaker.

374
00:26:57,689 --> 00:27:03,719
I was reformed thanks to
many people's support.

375
00:27:05,096 --> 00:27:11,296
I want to repay this society for accepting me.

376
00:27:17,142 --> 00:27:18,302
Wonderful.

377
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:20,875
Wonderful.

378
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:23,543
You have my support.

379
00:27:26,685 --> 00:27:27,652
Thank you.

380
00:27:34,693 --> 00:27:37,218
You look like my old flame.

381
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:46,026
I bet you are kind and earnest

382
00:27:46,238 --> 00:27:49,002
and honest like him.

383
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:51,203
Good luck.

384
00:27:52,911 --> 00:27:54,208
Let's go.

385
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:55,539
You're troubling him.

386
00:27:59,784 --> 00:28:02,719
I'm rooting for you.

387
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:06,850
My name's Yamaguchi.

388
00:28:07,926 --> 00:28:09,188
I'm rooting for you.

389
00:28:09,327 --> 00:28:11,227
"Akado High School"

390
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:15,059
Those guys yesterday pissed me off.

391
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,100
Whoever they were, Reita showed them.

392
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:23,230
They talked big but they were pussies.

393
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:25,069
You're awesome, Reita.

394
00:28:25,243 --> 00:28:26,267
Not really.

395
00:28:26,545 --> 00:28:28,945
- Another fight?
- Is that a problem?

396
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,813
Don't pop out of nowhere!

397
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:37,517
Fighting isn't necessarily bad but...

398
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,248
Then leave us alone.

399
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,443
Reita Takasugi, come out here!

400
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:10,420
I heard you and my buddies
got friendly yesterday.

401
00:29:11,656 --> 00:29:13,317
The guys from yesterday...

402
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:16,552
They're the Black Skull.

403
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:18,929
Black Skull?

404
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,292
A bad motorcycle gang.

405
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:34,744
A motorcycle gang is outside.
Please hurry!

406
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,111
Let's go.

407
00:29:42,954 --> 00:29:44,888
We're not done with you!

408
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,166
Why on earth did you get involved
with that sort?!

409
00:29:56,334 --> 00:30:00,862
Principal, they seem to be
a very violent group.

410
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,167
Extortions, assaults...
Many run-ins with the police.

411
00:30:04,709 --> 00:30:05,733
Scary.

412
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:09,945
A fight with guys like that of all people...

413
00:30:10,081 --> 00:30:11,139
It wasn't a fight.

414
00:30:11,282 --> 00:30:14,649
Reita stopped them from
extorting money from us.

415
00:30:14,786 --> 00:30:18,984
You're saying it wasn't some foolish reason?

416
00:30:19,157 --> 00:30:21,489
If you don't believe us, then forget it.

417
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:24,853
We can't forget it.

418
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,267
Is it true what you told us?

419
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:34,869
Yeah.

420
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,620
- Vice Principal.
- Principal.

421
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,660
They're not lying.

422
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,856
You believe them?

423
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,397
I do.

424
00:31:04,235 --> 00:31:08,934
If they're lying,
I'll see it in their eyes.

425
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:17,246
Are you sure?

426
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,248
I'll hold you responsible.

427
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:26,415
The next time your students cause trouble,

428
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,615
you're fired.

429
00:31:30,495 --> 00:31:31,792
Fine.

430
00:31:32,497 --> 00:31:36,160
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

431
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:51,008
- See it in our eyes?!
- She's trying to act tough.

432
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:52,673
She doesn't mean it.

433
00:31:52,817 --> 00:31:55,411
Teachers are all the same.

434
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,587
You okay, Reita?

435
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:00,748
They're real bad asses.

436
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:03,325
Been arrested a lot.

437
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:06,524
Serious?

438
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:09,022
They'll be back.

439
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,861
We'll be in deep shit.

440
00:32:12,237 --> 00:32:16,367
The next time your students cause trouble,

441
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:17,839
you're fired.

442
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,873
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

443
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:30,377
Where're you going?

444
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,552
To settle the matter.

445
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:38,753
- That's crazy.
- They'll kill you.

446
00:32:40,198 --> 00:32:43,326
I don't wanna owe her.

447
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,916
Let's start. Take your seats.

448
00:33:02,754 --> 00:33:03,948
What happened?

449
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:08,853
Takasugi took off.

450
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:12,628
To settle things with the bikers.

451
00:33:13,765 --> 00:33:17,201
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

452
00:33:27,612 --> 00:33:31,480
You guys, why'd you let him go?

453
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:35,611
Why let him go alone?

454
00:33:36,721 --> 00:33:38,313
Because...

455
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:40,521
Those guys are seriously bad...

456
00:33:43,294 --> 00:33:45,524
Aren't you his friends?!

457
00:33:48,132 --> 00:33:49,895
Yankumi...

458
00:33:57,909 --> 00:34:03,108
Her ideas on friends and loyalty...

459
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:09,718
They're meaningless and annoying at first.

460
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:15,719
We thought so too.

461
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:21,464
But now we understand.

462
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,828
The things she taught us...

463
00:34:30,975 --> 00:34:34,672
Calling yourselves friends is easy

464
00:34:35,313 --> 00:34:38,248
but that's just talk.

465
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:41,780
If you're friends for real,

466
00:34:43,588 --> 00:34:48,821
you stick together no matter what happens.

467
00:34:50,461 --> 00:34:52,019
Right?

468
00:35:00,204 --> 00:35:01,364
What now?

469
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:04,104
What should we do?

470
00:35:21,225 --> 00:35:25,457
You have balls coming here alone.

471
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,091
Fight me 1-on-1.

472
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:29,664
1-on-1?

473
00:35:29,834 --> 00:35:35,272
If I win, stay away from us and our school.

474
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:39,702
Did you hear that?

475
00:35:42,814 --> 00:35:44,543
Stop laughing!

476
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:50,814
Too bad. I don't fight 1-on-1.

477
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:42,059
Let him go... my precious student.

478
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,970
Who the hell are you?!

479
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:56,579
I'm his homeroom teacher.

480
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:59,546
A teacher?

481
00:38:25,076 --> 00:38:27,909
You really messed him up.

482
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:33,649
You're pathetic.

483
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:37,549
All of you ganging up on
one high school kid.

484
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,855
We're teaching him a lesson.

485
00:38:43,094 --> 00:38:45,892
He gets this for being a cocky asshole.

486
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:49,426
Common sense, right?

487
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:52,827
Don't make me laugh.

488
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:55,303
Common sense?

489
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,075
Don't pretend like you know
what you're talking about!

490
00:39:01,712 --> 00:39:02,838
Watch it.

491
00:39:08,152 --> 00:39:12,521
If words aren't enough, I'll fight you.

492
00:39:14,058 --> 00:39:15,923
Let me warn you.

493
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:19,958
I don't hold anything back
to protect my students.

494
00:39:51,662 --> 00:39:52,594
Odagiri.

495
00:39:53,431 --> 00:39:56,958
Fighting is done with bare hands.

496
00:40:04,008 --> 00:40:05,566
Haven't had enough?!

497
00:40:33,304 --> 00:40:36,501
Odagiri... thanks.

498
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:40,006
Whatever.

499
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,153
Reita!

500
00:40:56,027 --> 00:40:57,392
You okay?

501
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,256
Yeah.

502
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:03,198
Sorry you had to come alone.

503
00:41:03,968 --> 00:41:05,265
We're so sorry.

504
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,906
Forget about it.

505
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,178
You guys...

506
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:36,426
Now you're real friends.

507
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,742
So reckless, you...

508
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:58,352
No, you... What teacher fights?

509
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,422
This one.

510
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:10,630
You fight to protect the things you cherish.

511
00:42:13,504 --> 00:42:14,903
Things you cherish?

512
00:42:15,206 --> 00:42:16,366
Yeah.

513
00:42:19,043 --> 00:42:23,673
I cherish you guys.

514
00:42:25,383 --> 00:42:29,615
Teachers have to protect their students.

515
00:42:39,897 --> 00:42:43,731
All right! Let's run into the sunset!

516
00:42:45,836 --> 00:42:49,795
Follow my lead!

517
00:42:50,908 --> 00:42:54,400
You guys, follow me!

518
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:03,115
What a weird teacher.

519
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,354
She is.

520
00:43:06,757 --> 00:43:11,558
But no one else tries so annoyingly hard to

521
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,759
relate to us.

522
00:43:19,136 --> 00:43:21,161
What sunset?

523
00:43:39,156 --> 00:43:40,418
Stop!

524
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,420
Stop!

525
00:44:14,258 --> 00:44:16,158
Good morning.

526
00:44:19,196 --> 00:44:20,356
Good morning.

527
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:24,027
G'morning.

528
00:44:24,168 --> 00:44:25,226
Morning.

529
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:31,705
Mochizuki, Matsushita, Igarashi, Muto...

530
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:34,403
What?

531
00:44:34,912 --> 00:44:38,473
Did you just say that to me?

532
00:44:40,251 --> 00:44:41,775
Who else is there?

533
00:44:42,186 --> 00:44:43,710
You complaining?

534
00:44:44,388 --> 00:44:46,379
Finally...

535
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:54,093
You guys are opening up to me.

536
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:59,665
From now, the mornings will be...

537
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,368
Good morning.

538
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,041
Good morning, Yankumi!

539
00:45:09,179 --> 00:45:10,407
Good morning.

540
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:12,946
Good morning, Yankumi!

541
00:45:15,219 --> 00:45:16,880
Good morning!

542
00:45:17,087 --> 00:45:19,487
Good morning, Yankumi!

543
00:45:19,823 --> 00:45:21,450
Good morning, class.

544
00:45:22,426 --> 00:45:26,021
My beloved students.

545
00:45:28,632 --> 00:45:30,896
I knew it would come!

546
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:34,604
A lovely morning like this!

547
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,008
You'll be late for the faculty meeting.

548
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:45,572
Oops.

549
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:49,909
Don't be late, you guys!

550
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:51,984
Look who's talking.

551
00:45:55,259 --> 00:45:59,286
Now that I am the principal

552
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:01,727
I want you teachers to be

553
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:06,393
strict with your pupils.

554
00:46:06,904 --> 00:46:10,101
The first semester is almost over.

555
00:46:10,307 --> 00:46:13,708
The final exams start
next week so classes will be

556
00:46:13,877 --> 00:46:16,539
shortened starting today.

557
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:21,208
Many students take advantage of the situation

558
00:46:21,385 --> 00:46:25,845
and use the extra time to
play around and get in trouble.

559
00:46:26,156 --> 00:46:31,321
Please make sure you prevent that.

560
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:35,929
Yesterday, a student in Ara High

561
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,762
was arrested for drug possession.

562
00:46:39,703 --> 00:46:41,034
For drugs?

563
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:42,769
Miss Yamaguchi!

564
00:46:45,075 --> 00:46:46,440
Idiot.

565
00:46:46,644 --> 00:46:47,702
You're late.

566
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:49,173
I'm sorry.

567
00:46:50,114 --> 00:46:55,518
Drug possession by a student
is a serious problem.

568
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:56,914
A teacher being late...

569
00:46:57,087 --> 00:46:59,487
Nowadays, even college students

570
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:02,524
and ordinary housewives are doing drugs.

571
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:03,784
Is that true?

572
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:08,728
They don't understand
the terrible consequences.

573
00:47:09,667 --> 00:47:12,864
Drugs destroy the body and soul.

574
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,332
It's frightening.

575
00:47:14,505 --> 00:47:17,133
I hear a big drug ring is
running the operation.

576
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:23,341
That's unforgivable.

577
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:29,147
Getting rich by selling drugs...

578
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:32,754
Where's their sense of duty and justice?

579
00:47:33,023 --> 00:47:34,752
- Duty?
- Justice?

580
00:47:34,892 --> 00:47:36,052
Miss Yamaguchi!

581
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:40,287
Such no-good rotten scumbags

582
00:47:40,864 --> 00:47:43,094
need a serious beatdown!

583
00:47:46,603 --> 00:47:48,468
You're talking like a yakuza.

584
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:55,367
Excuse us.

585
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:59,182
Who are you?
We're in a meeting.

586
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,575
- We're the police.

587
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:02,708
- Police?

588
00:48:04,288 --> 00:48:05,846
"Faculty Room"

589
00:48:06,056 --> 00:48:08,183
Kazama dealing drugs?

590
00:48:11,228 --> 00:48:13,093
It can't be true.

591
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:16,155
He's not that kind of guy.

592
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,062
It must be a mistake.

593
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:21,299
We were informed about

594
00:48:21,538 --> 00:48:24,871
a drug deal in a warehouse.

595
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,107
When we arrived there...

596
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:38,417
The dealers were gone.

597
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:44,585
But we found evidence and a wallet.

598
00:48:45,362 --> 00:48:46,659
Look.

599
00:48:49,533 --> 00:48:51,125
It belongs to

600
00:48:51,268 --> 00:48:53,236
Ren Kazama.

601
00:48:57,207 --> 00:49:01,769
That doesn't prove he's the culprit.

602
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:04,203
That's right.

603
00:49:05,182 --> 00:49:10,017
But he's been missing since last night.

604
00:49:14,358 --> 00:49:17,816
You guys, listen!

605
00:49:17,995 --> 00:49:20,896
The cops are after our
upperclassman Kazama.

606
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:22,994
What did he do?

607
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,691
They said he sold drugs.

608
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,565
You're kidding.

609
00:49:39,917 --> 00:49:44,217
A former student, a criminal...

610
00:49:44,721 --> 00:49:46,689
It's not for certain.

611
00:49:49,526 --> 00:49:52,893
I suppose so but...

612
00:49:53,664 --> 00:49:58,397
I think it's true though.

613
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:03,739
Me too.

614
00:50:05,175 --> 00:50:09,009
He's 19, still just a kid.

615
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,172
Perhaps he wanted to make
some easy money.

616
00:50:13,317 --> 00:50:16,548
He'd never do anything like that.

617
00:50:16,787 --> 00:50:22,054
"My child would never..."
is an unsafe thought.

618
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:27,522
And if he's innocent,
why would he be in hiding?

619
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:32,295
I'm sure there's a reason.

620
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:42,274
Odagiri, take care of the class.

621
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,447
You're not going
to go look for him, are you?

622
00:50:49,586 --> 00:50:52,680
He's not your student anymore.

623
00:50:52,856 --> 00:50:54,346
You're wrong.

624
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,593
He is my student.

625
00:50:59,563 --> 00:51:00,757
Miss Yamaguchi...

626
00:51:00,898 --> 00:51:02,422
Miss Yamaguchi...

627
00:51:08,405 --> 00:51:11,306
Your call cannot be connected.

628
00:51:12,743 --> 00:51:14,005
Kazama...

629
00:51:42,105 --> 00:51:43,367
You guys...

630
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:54,144
Kura told me about Ren.

631
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,287
The cops came to the office this morning.

632
00:51:57,688 --> 00:52:00,919
Ren might get fired.

633
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:02,113
Oh no...

634
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:04,318
He'll never do anything illegal.

635
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:06,553
There must be a reason
why he's running.

636
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,357
- Yeah.
- There's gotta be.

637
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:12,662
We believe in Ren.

638
00:52:16,139 --> 00:52:18,198
He's our friend.

639
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:20,501
Let's find him.

640
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:30,110
You guys...

641
00:52:31,188 --> 00:52:33,918
Let's go find him!

642
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:07,215
That way.

643
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,957
You go that way.

644
00:53:21,438 --> 00:53:22,837
Let's split up.

645
00:53:27,277 --> 00:53:28,403
Takasugi...

646
00:53:32,115 --> 00:53:34,345
Have you seen Kazama?

647
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,573
No.

648
00:53:35,752 --> 00:53:36,946
He's in trouble, right?

649
00:53:37,888 --> 00:53:40,083
He's done nothing wrong.

650
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:46,890
If you see him, let me know.

651
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:48,792
Thanks.
=====

652
00:53:55,673 --> 00:53:57,641
Let's split up.

653
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:21,692
"Yankumi"

654
00:54:50,695 --> 00:54:52,322
Your call cannot be...

655
00:54:53,698 --> 00:54:56,428
Where is he?

656
00:55:08,413 --> 00:55:10,711
She never came back.

657
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,041
I don't know what happened

658
00:55:49,687 --> 00:55:52,554
but you should tell Yankumi.

659
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:01,892
I don't wanna trouble her.

660
00:56:05,103 --> 00:56:06,764
She's not my...

661
00:56:09,774 --> 00:56:11,708
Teacher anymore?

662
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,116
She's not like that.

663
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:31,994
Do you have a place to go?

664
00:56:39,037 --> 00:56:42,200
This was the only place, huh?

665
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,811
Kazama!

666
00:56:51,049 --> 00:56:52,277
Ren!

667
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:54,484
Thank God.

668
00:56:57,655 --> 00:57:01,318
Why are you running around
without telling us anything?

669
00:57:01,492 --> 00:57:02,481
We were worried.

670
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,787
You should've called.

671
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:05,987
We're your friends, aren't we?

672
00:57:06,164 --> 00:57:08,223
You're not alone, you know.

673
00:57:10,201 --> 00:57:12,465
You're hurt.

674
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:18,272
I'm fine.

675
00:57:19,410 --> 00:57:20,707
Kazama...

676
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,411
Why didn't you come to me?

677
00:57:30,788 --> 00:57:32,153
Why?

678
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,250
Say something.

679
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:44,293
He didn't want to trouble you.

680
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:52,742
You'll go out of your way to help him.

681
00:57:54,345 --> 00:58:00,011
That's why he didn't tell you.

682
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,914
Right?

683
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:08,452
Kazama...

684
00:58:11,896 --> 00:58:13,022
In high school...

685
00:58:14,165 --> 00:58:17,657
I caused you so much trouble.

686
00:58:18,803 --> 00:58:21,829
Even now, after I graduated...

687
00:58:22,607 --> 00:58:27,442
I was ashamed.

688
00:58:31,683 --> 00:58:34,880
Listen... A teacher

689
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,283
welcomes trouble from her students.

690
00:58:37,455 --> 00:58:39,480
But I'm not your student.

691
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:40,919
You...

692
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,462
are my precious student.

693
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,729
Right now, I'm in charge of this class.

694
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:55,964
But you guys who graduated

695
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,836
and students from other schools...

696
00:58:59,177 --> 00:59:01,111
Are all my precious students.

697
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:08,342
And you're not alone.

698
00:59:09,654 --> 00:59:11,485
Not just them.

699
00:59:12,056 --> 00:59:15,617
Everyone else from 3D

700
00:59:15,793 --> 00:59:18,125
was looking for you.

701
00:59:40,985 --> 00:59:42,316
Sorry.

702
00:59:44,722 --> 00:59:46,451
You guys...

703
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,393
I'm so sorry.

704
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,490
Sorry.

705
01:00:01,172 --> 01:00:02,730
So sorry...

706
01:00:10,314 --> 01:00:11,542
I...

707
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:17,553
found this sweet job through a friend.

708
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,825
All I had to do was

709
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:31,430
make a delivery as instructed.

710
01:00:32,236 --> 01:00:34,101
But something was odd.

711
01:00:52,156 --> 01:00:53,384
Over here.

712
01:01:01,732 --> 01:01:03,029
Open it.

713
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:04,625
Yes.

714
01:01:11,008 --> 01:01:12,669
Open the box.

715
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,617
Put it in the car.

716
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:33,123
I'm sorry.

717
01:01:33,297 --> 01:01:34,559
You klutz!

718
01:01:43,608 --> 01:01:47,704
This is something bad, isn't it?

719
01:01:51,649 --> 01:01:53,082
I'm quitting.

720
01:01:54,118 --> 01:01:56,518
I didn't realize
what I was delivering.

721
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:05,359
You want money, right?

722
01:02:06,063 --> 01:02:11,296
You gotta do "something bad"
to make 30,000 yen a night.

723
01:02:11,736 --> 01:02:13,863
It's too late.

724
01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:17,669
You abetted a crime.

725
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:22,379
Just do as you're told.

726
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,311
Mr. Terada.

727
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:31,983
All right.

728
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:33,751
The cops are coming.

729
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:54,774
I was scared and ashamed.

730
01:02:58,282 --> 01:03:00,443
I didn't know what to do.

731
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:02,485
Why did you accept the job?

732
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,143
I wanted money.

733
01:03:04,956 --> 01:03:06,253
Money?

734
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:09,255
Once I started working,

735
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:15,431
I thought I could support my sister.

736
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:20,864
But my salary's so low...

737
01:03:23,741 --> 01:03:25,174
That's why

738
01:03:27,244 --> 01:03:33,149
I jumped at the opportunity.

739
01:03:36,053 --> 01:03:38,715
I was an idiot.

740
01:03:45,796 --> 01:03:47,559
Listen, Kazama.

741
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:52,635
Trying to make money isn't bad.

742
01:03:52,903 --> 01:03:58,842
But don't be fooled by quick easy money.

743
01:04:00,778 --> 01:04:02,837
Money is important.

744
01:04:03,648 --> 01:04:06,242
But it's not everything.

745
01:04:10,688 --> 01:04:13,680
Don't ever forget that.

746
01:04:21,198 --> 01:04:23,029
You guys too.

747
01:04:28,372 --> 01:04:29,862
Okay.

748
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:36,842
You can stay at my house for a while.

749
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:44,318
Yankumi is amazing.

750
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:48,922
I've never known a teacher like her.

751
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,694
She hasn't changed.

752
01:04:51,896 --> 01:04:53,124
Still no sex appeal.

753
01:04:54,031 --> 01:04:56,056
Yankumi is...

754
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,266
still Yankumi.

755
01:05:10,214 --> 01:05:13,206
Sorry to get you involved.

756
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,681
Whatever.

757
01:05:22,026 --> 01:05:23,323
I'll see you.

758
01:05:23,661 --> 01:05:25,026
Odagiri.

759
01:05:27,698 --> 01:05:31,327
You seem troubled too.

760
01:05:33,537 --> 01:05:36,506
Everything's cool...

761
01:05:40,177 --> 01:05:41,235
Okay.

762
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:46,740
My Lady, this guy Terada...

763
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:50,910
You were right.
He's a drug dealer.

764
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,789
So it's true.

765
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,617
He avoids getting caught

766
01:05:54,892 --> 01:05:58,453
by making the greenhorns deliver the dope.

767
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:00,288
The bastard.

768
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:04,999
Enticing innocent guys with money

769
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,433
and involving them in crime...

770
01:06:07,671 --> 01:06:09,332
But Kumiko...

771
01:06:10,574 --> 01:06:15,534
There's a ringleader.

772
01:06:15,713 --> 01:06:16,941
Ringleader?

773
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:18,105
Him.

774
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,845
Kentaro Kurose.

775
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:33,123
He uses his success
and legit company as a front

776
01:06:34,999 --> 01:06:37,524
for his drug business.

777
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,300
He wants power and position
to make more money.

778
01:06:55,686 --> 01:06:59,019
A crook trying to become a politician...

779
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:01,750
"From failure to success"

780
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:07,755
Unforgivable.

781
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,199
Where're you off to alone?

782
01:07:58,515 --> 01:08:05,045
I don't want to interfere with
what you do for your students

783
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:09,189
but this time is different.

784
01:08:12,096 --> 01:08:17,466
You're risking your job as a teacher.

785
01:08:18,903 --> 01:08:20,700
You sure about this?

786
01:08:23,707 --> 01:08:26,141
I can't ignore these bastards

787
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:32,280
who tried to take advantage
of my precious student.

788
01:08:35,252 --> 01:08:36,810
Kumiko!

789
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:44,090
I taught my students a few things.

790
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,754
Don't lie.

791
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:49,792
Live with pride and dignity.

792
01:08:50,935 --> 01:08:52,835
That's why

793
01:08:53,304 --> 01:08:58,435
I can't pretend not to know
what Kurose truly is.

794
01:09:03,113 --> 01:09:04,410
I see.

795
01:09:05,783 --> 01:09:07,580
We have a problem.

796
01:09:07,751 --> 01:09:08,945
Those guys are gone.

797
01:09:25,769 --> 01:09:26,793
This is it.

798
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:28,967
It's huge.

799
01:09:30,607 --> 01:09:32,336
We should find some evidence here.

800
01:09:32,476 --> 01:09:35,343
Yeah, let's nail those jerks.

801
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:37,912
How do we get inside?

802
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:39,982
The security looks tough.

803
01:09:40,317 --> 01:09:41,477
What's that?

804
01:09:44,021 --> 01:09:46,455
"Kurose Campaign Rally"

805
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,818
Campaign rally?

806
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,424
Let's go to the back.

807
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:58,967
Ogata, what are you doing?
Where are you?

808
01:09:59,303 --> 01:10:01,237
At the ringleader's.

809
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:02,429
What?

810
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:05,942
Kentaro Kurose, right?

811
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,140
You idiot! Come back!

812
01:10:09,313 --> 01:10:10,871
That car!

813
01:10:19,056 --> 01:10:20,250
Now.

814
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:22,618
Hello?

815
01:10:27,231 --> 01:10:29,927
Those reckless fools.

816
01:10:48,419 --> 01:10:49,511
Odagiri...

817
01:10:52,389 --> 01:10:53,686
Hop on.

818
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:10,104
"Math class today: Study period"

819
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:16,072
Weird... Yamaguchi took the day off.

820
01:11:16,513 --> 01:11:19,482
Odagiri too. Strange huh.

821
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:24,483
Do you think something
happened with Kazama?

822
01:11:27,091 --> 01:11:31,027
Kurose is running for office...

823
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:34,255
We're at Kurose's campaign rally.

824
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:54,643
Yankumi...

825
01:11:55,252 --> 01:11:56,150
Ryu!

826
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,513
Tsucchi...

827
01:11:57,788 --> 01:12:00,780
Tsuchiya, what are you doing here?

828
01:12:00,958 --> 01:12:05,918
Working. Assistant cameraman.

829
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,727
Yeah?

830
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,559
I still have a lot to learn.

831
01:12:10,734 --> 01:12:13,362
We'll fill you in later.

832
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:14,867
Let's go.

833
01:12:18,509 --> 01:12:22,411
Kurose's campaign rally is about to begin.

834
01:12:22,813 --> 01:12:26,271
Many supporters have gathered here.

835
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:27,814
Was that?

836
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,919
Why is she there?

837
01:12:35,626 --> 01:12:38,117
Wasn't that Miss Yamaguchi and Odagiri?

838
01:12:38,328 --> 01:12:39,420
I saw them too.

839
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:44,862
That's not possible.
They're both sick today.

840
01:12:45,068 --> 01:12:46,933
The principal's right.

841
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:48,571
It wasn't them.

842
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,818
Odagiri's late.

843
01:13:05,556 --> 01:13:07,114
You are late.

844
01:13:21,405 --> 01:13:25,535
No drugs anywhere.

845
01:13:25,742 --> 01:13:29,735
Maybe he keeps them somewhere else.

846
01:13:29,913 --> 01:13:34,009
Where are we?
We're lost.

847
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:37,119
Is Kurose really the ringleader?

848
01:13:38,355 --> 01:13:39,481
Hide!

849
01:13:52,936 --> 01:13:54,494
That's him.

850
01:14:07,217 --> 01:14:12,780
Kentaro Kurose's campaign
rally is about to begin.

851
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:17,790
The IT giant is running for
a seat in the Lower House.

852
01:14:17,961 --> 01:14:20,225
This is a live broadcast.

853
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:24,127
Kurose! Kurose!

854
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:07,207
Where did they go?

855
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,611
It's starting.

856
01:15:22,492 --> 01:15:24,289
There's nothing.

857
01:15:56,693 --> 01:15:58,160
It's the box.

858
01:15:58,862 --> 01:16:00,352
Open the box.

859
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,826
Ren!

860
01:16:05,202 --> 01:16:06,260
What is it?

861
01:16:21,485 --> 01:16:22,952
There it is.

862
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:26,988
Then all these boxes?

863
01:16:27,224 --> 01:16:30,057
Now we have proof.

864
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:33,056
What're you doing there?!

865
01:16:39,236 --> 01:16:40,828
Kazama!

866
01:16:46,743 --> 01:16:49,177
You shouldn't be here.

867
01:16:51,214 --> 01:16:53,444
Now I can't let you leave.

868
01:16:57,354 --> 01:17:01,916
I'm happy to see you all here today.

869
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:05,323
Thank you for coming.

870
01:17:10,133 --> 01:17:15,298
I stepped off the path
during high school and

871
01:17:16,139 --> 01:17:18,869
was even arrested by the police.

872
01:17:19,476 --> 01:17:22,604
But now, thanks to your

873
01:17:22,779 --> 01:17:26,044
and many people's support,

874
01:17:26,249 --> 01:17:28,649
I've found my place in society.

875
01:17:38,395 --> 01:17:41,262
Kids should keep their noses out.

876
01:17:55,312 --> 01:17:56,404
Yankumi!

877
01:17:58,315 --> 01:17:59,577
You guys okay?

878
01:18:01,918 --> 01:18:04,682
This was stupid of you.

879
01:18:04,855 --> 01:18:05,583
Sorry.

880
01:18:05,755 --> 01:18:06,915
We almost died.

881
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:08,955
I almost peed in my pants.

882
01:18:14,397 --> 01:18:17,264
A society where youth can dream.

883
01:18:18,702 --> 01:18:20,567
Catch the dream.

884
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:27,442
Kurose... You're unforgivable.

885
01:18:30,947 --> 01:18:33,780
I'll handle things from here.

886
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:35,650
What're you talking about?!

887
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:40,017
I can't put you guys in any more danger.

888
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,088
But...

889
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:44,961
Odagiri, take care of them.

890
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:50,865
Yankumi!

891
01:18:51,034 --> 01:18:52,228
Why'd you let her go?!

892
01:18:52,369 --> 01:18:54,030
We can't just leave her!

893
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:59,568
We'll do the things we can do.

894
01:19:02,379 --> 01:19:08,318
I know what it feels like
to be labeled a delinquent.

895
01:19:08,685 --> 01:19:13,349
I can reform the education system.

896
01:19:13,823 --> 01:19:16,121
In this unjust world,

897
01:19:16,459 --> 01:19:21,089
education is most important.

898
01:19:21,631 --> 01:19:23,997
To foster compassion,

899
01:19:24,601 --> 01:19:28,628
parents, teachers, and

900
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:33,468
the people of the country
must be united in the heart.

901
01:19:34,411 --> 01:19:36,504
Don't make me laugh!

902
01:19:49,793 --> 01:19:52,421
Compassion huh?

903
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:55,159
Who are you?

904
01:19:56,433 --> 01:19:57,730
Me?

905
01:20:00,203 --> 01:20:04,936
Just a high school teacher.

906
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:23,224
A crooked money monger
pretending to be a do-gooder

907
01:20:23,426 --> 01:20:27,760
have no right preaching
about education and compassion.

908
01:20:36,773 --> 01:20:40,038
Is there something you'd like to say?

909
01:20:43,713 --> 01:20:45,340
Miss Yamaguchi...

910
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:58,859
You're kidding...

911
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:05,062
Look.

912
01:21:05,201 --> 01:21:06,668
It's Yamaguchi.

913
01:21:08,505 --> 01:21:09,631
Yamaguchi!

914
01:21:09,839 --> 01:21:10,863
What is she doing?

915
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,702
She's gonna get it.

916
01:21:28,058 --> 01:21:29,423
My Lady...

917
01:21:33,763 --> 01:21:35,025
Katayama!

918
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:38,224
Matsukata!

919
01:21:38,768 --> 01:21:40,030
Let's go!

920
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:45,305
How dare you use my precious student

921
01:21:45,508 --> 01:21:48,841
for your dirty money-making scheme.

922
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:54,447
I don't know what you're talking about.

923
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:55,983
Stop the act!

924
01:21:57,353 --> 01:22:03,314
What you are is the leader of a drug ring.

925
01:22:14,537 --> 01:22:19,372
I think you should stop now.

926
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,907
You're troubling everyone here.

927
01:22:22,746 --> 01:22:24,111
Escort her outside.

928
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:30,049
I'm here with a major scoop.

929
01:22:31,755 --> 01:22:36,351
We found something in the
Dream Associates' basement.

930
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:39,085
Look at this.

931
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:47,431
They're all drugs.

932
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:52,198
This place is the hub of a drug trade.

933
01:22:52,408 --> 01:22:54,706
Drugs everywhere!

934
01:22:56,412 --> 01:22:58,073
Thanks, Tsucchi.

935
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,177
Continue the broadcast.

936
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:08,417
Tsuchiya, good job.

937
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:23,965
Those reckless fools.

938
01:23:25,241 --> 01:23:26,640
Why?

939
01:23:26,876 --> 01:23:30,607
There's something else over here.

940
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:34,379
These men work for Mr. Kurose.

941
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:39,513
Look at what they have.

942
01:23:40,023 --> 01:23:41,581
Guns!

943
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,421
Very dangerous.

944
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:47,458
You all should be careful.

945
01:23:47,664 --> 01:23:49,825
Those men are probably armed too.

946
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:07,807
Please calm down, folks!

947
01:24:08,484 --> 01:24:12,215
This is a mistake!

948
01:24:19,929 --> 01:24:21,419
Let's get in there!

949
01:24:39,883 --> 01:24:41,783
How could this happen?

950
01:24:48,591 --> 01:24:50,354
You bitch...

951
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:54,994
Don't screw with me.

952
01:24:56,099 --> 01:24:58,761
Showing your true colors now?

953
01:25:10,847 --> 01:25:12,178
Get her.

954
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:56,220
Watch out!

955
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:04,292
Odagiri, why are you here?

956
01:26:04,701 --> 01:26:06,635
I can't let you fight alone.

957
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,562
Odagiri!

958
01:26:13,343 --> 01:26:14,970
This brat's gonna die!

959
01:26:17,246 --> 01:26:21,376
Don't worry about me! Just get them!

960
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:26,717
Yankumi!

961
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,590
Crush them!

962
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,224
Stop it!

963
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:47,839
Stop!

964
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:51,339
Get your hands off our teacher!

965
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,195
You guys...

966
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:12,529
Who are you?

967
01:27:14,203 --> 01:27:15,568
We're...

968
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:19,138
her students.

969
01:27:20,143 --> 01:27:22,373
Teacher-pupil love, is it?

970
01:27:22,812 --> 01:27:24,803
I don't want to hurt you.

971
01:27:25,882 --> 01:27:27,349
Get out of here.

972
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:29,517
No frickin' way!

973
01:27:30,086 --> 01:27:32,816
We're not gonna desert her!

974
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:35,115
She's our precious teacher!

975
01:27:37,593 --> 01:27:41,552
We owe her everything!

976
01:27:41,731 --> 01:27:45,599
You're up against all of us!

977
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:00,945
Yankumi taught us to fight

978
01:28:01,317 --> 01:28:04,343
to protect what we cherish.

979
01:28:05,254 --> 01:28:07,017
That's why

980
01:28:07,623 --> 01:28:11,081
we'll fight you to protect her!

981
01:28:19,702 --> 01:28:21,260
Stay away!

982
01:28:27,076 --> 01:28:30,807
Stay away from these scum.

983
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:37,050
You're my precious students.

984
01:28:37,353 --> 01:28:42,120
I'm not putting you in any more danger.

985
01:28:42,525 --> 01:28:45,756
We can't just sit and watch you get beat up!

986
01:28:46,629 --> 01:28:48,654
I said, stay away!

987
01:28:53,636 --> 01:28:55,831
I'm not gonna let you

988
01:28:57,373 --> 01:29:00,171
ruin your futures

989
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:04,270
for dirty lowlifes like them.

990
01:29:08,651 --> 01:29:13,145
You guys are my dream.

991
01:30:11,914 --> 01:30:13,506
Still want more?

992
01:30:21,924 --> 01:30:23,585
Wait! Hey!

993
01:30:25,027 --> 01:30:26,756
Come back!

994
01:30:30,099 --> 01:30:32,090
Now, Mr. Kurose...

995
01:30:33,436 --> 01:30:34,994
it's just you.

996
01:30:51,354 --> 01:30:55,484
Kurose had a gun!

997
01:30:55,725 --> 01:30:57,920
The police cannot move in.

998
01:31:00,196 --> 01:31:01,823
Yamaguchi...

999
01:31:08,304 --> 01:31:11,569
Move! Our teacher's inside!

1000
01:31:21,284 --> 01:31:22,979
Yankumi...

1001
01:31:25,655 --> 01:31:27,020
Yankumi...

1002
01:31:32,361 --> 01:31:33,589
Yankumi?!

1003
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:41,927
Yankumi...

1004
01:31:51,447 --> 01:31:52,846
Miss Yamaguchi!

1005
01:32:03,392 --> 01:32:05,656
Everything I built

1006
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:09,728
you just destroyed.

1007
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:16,399
Everything you built was worthless anyway.

1008
01:32:17,873 --> 01:32:21,969
Did you say worthless?

1009
01:32:22,178 --> 01:32:27,445
Money means nothing when
you step on people to get it.

1010
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:29,208
Stop acting like a saint!

1011
01:32:33,656 --> 01:32:37,353
Money is money.

1012
01:32:38,761 --> 01:32:40,956
Is it that important to you?

1013
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:44,899
Society only trusts

1014
01:32:46,635 --> 01:32:49,035
those who have money.

1015
01:32:50,473 --> 01:32:52,498
Look at me.

1016
01:32:52,808 --> 01:32:56,642
The more money I made,
the more supporters I had.

1017
01:32:57,546 --> 01:32:59,036
With money,

1018
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,341
I can have anything.

1019
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:11,551
Nowadays, you sure can buy
most things with money.

1020
01:33:12,661 --> 01:33:13,923
But...

1021
01:33:14,497 --> 01:33:17,091
you can't move people's hearts.

1022
01:33:19,034 --> 01:33:21,025
Hearts?

1023
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:25,731
Your henchmen left you, didn't they?

1024
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:29,542
But not these guys.

1025
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:34,072
Even with you and your gun,
they won't budge.

1026
01:33:42,391 --> 01:33:46,384
You're right.
Money is important.

1027
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:52,799
But some things are more important.

1028
01:33:54,336 --> 01:33:57,328
Friends, family...

1029
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:02,307
Working hard for them
and spending time with them.

1030
01:34:02,478 --> 01:34:04,173
That's happiness.

1031
01:34:05,815 --> 01:34:07,806
Such small happiness.

1032
01:34:08,050 --> 01:34:10,610
There's no difference!

1033
01:34:11,153 --> 01:34:12,814
Happiness is

1034
01:34:13,556 --> 01:34:18,892
being proud with the sun shining on your face.

1035
01:34:20,162 --> 01:34:22,187
Money can't buy it.

1036
01:34:24,033 --> 01:34:27,491
There're times you don't feel like laughing.

1037
01:34:28,504 --> 01:34:33,441
But don't give up.
Hang in there.

1038
01:34:36,278 --> 01:34:39,736
If you mess up, regret it.

1039
01:34:40,516 --> 01:34:43,349
Have the courage to start over.

1040
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:48,513
Then you'll find happiness.

1041
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:56,164
That's what my students do.

1042
01:34:59,301 --> 01:35:03,704
They were all like you before.

1043
01:35:05,307 --> 01:35:07,867
Hopeless outcasts...

1044
01:35:08,811 --> 01:35:12,713
They still get in trouble,

1045
01:35:13,015 --> 01:35:18,385
get fired from work and have money problems.

1046
01:35:19,955 --> 01:35:24,722
But they live with pride and dignity.

1047
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:34,666
You know why?

1048
01:35:38,307 --> 01:35:42,676
They have something they cherish.

1049
01:35:44,547 --> 01:35:50,076
Friends that are connected in the heart.

1050
01:36:33,662 --> 01:36:35,630
Freeze!

1051
01:36:43,606 --> 01:36:45,301
Don't shoot!

1052
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:49,102
Give him a chance.

1053
01:36:49,912 --> 01:36:54,178
To pay for his crime and start over.

1054
01:37:18,607 --> 01:37:20,336
Yankumi!

1055
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:28,478
You guys...

1056
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:40,453
You know...

1057
01:37:42,064 --> 01:37:45,158
You guys are lucky.

1058
01:37:48,971 --> 01:37:51,439
To have teacher like her...

1059
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,981
Yankumi!

1060
01:38:09,925 --> 01:38:11,586
I'm okay.

1061
01:38:12,161 --> 01:38:13,856
Yamaguchi!

1062
01:38:23,138 --> 01:38:24,935
Takasugi...

1063
01:38:27,776 --> 01:38:29,869
You guys came?

1064
01:38:31,714 --> 01:38:35,844
Stop acting like a nut case.
You're a teacher.

1065
01:38:44,727 --> 01:38:46,160
Tsuchiya...

1066
01:38:52,935 --> 01:38:54,402
Thanks.

1067
01:39:30,372 --> 01:39:31,839
Thanks.

1068
01:39:35,511 --> 01:39:37,103
Thanks.

1069
01:39:40,449 --> 01:39:42,383
You guys are all...

1070
01:39:43,352 --> 01:39:45,980
my wonderful students.

1071
01:39:55,964 --> 01:40:00,560
That's my high school teacher.

1072
01:40:11,513 --> 01:40:13,310
Yankumi...

1073
01:40:18,086 --> 01:40:20,486
I have big shoes to fill.

1074
01:40:39,508 --> 01:40:43,205
I bet the director and principal are so mad.

1075
01:40:45,447 --> 01:40:47,312
I can't make excuses.

1076
01:40:47,583 --> 01:40:51,110
I'll have to apologize.

1077
01:40:57,392 --> 01:40:58,586
Hey...

1078
01:40:58,727 --> 01:41:00,558
Hi, Yankumi.

1079
01:41:00,729 --> 01:41:03,857
Minami! How are you?!

1080
01:41:03,999 --> 01:41:05,296
Okay.

1081
01:41:05,534 --> 01:41:10,471
I saw you on TV.
I'm glad you haven't changed.

1082
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:11,970
Come on...

1083
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:15,105
I remembered high school.

1084
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:18,279
You made me feel like working harder.

1085
01:41:20,515 --> 01:41:21,948
Good for you.

1086
01:41:24,353 --> 01:41:27,754
I have to get to work. See ya.

1087
01:41:31,426 --> 01:41:34,020
Bye! Good luck!

1088
01:41:37,766 --> 01:41:40,132
Minami hasn't changed.

1089
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:41,326
I know.

1090
01:41:43,372 --> 01:41:44,930
Noda!

1091
01:41:45,274 --> 01:41:47,265
Long time no see.

1092
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:50,673
What are you doing here?

1093
01:41:50,979 --> 01:41:54,210
Probably the same as Minami.

1094
01:41:56,418 --> 01:41:59,819
I hit a wall at my job

1095
01:42:00,322 --> 01:42:03,985
but I saw you on TV yesterday.

1096
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:06,889
I felt encouraged.

1097
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:08,921
I wanted you to know.

1098
01:42:12,167 --> 01:42:13,725
Noda...

1099
01:42:16,104 --> 01:42:17,628
See ya.

1100
01:42:19,408 --> 01:42:20,966
See ya.

1101
01:42:27,316 --> 01:42:28,749
You really are

1102
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:34,281
a teacher we're proud of.

1103
01:42:43,298 --> 01:42:47,701
Bye! Good luck!

1104
01:43:05,053 --> 01:43:06,577
Uchiyama!

1105
01:43:08,724 --> 01:43:11,716
Minami and Noda came too?

1106
01:43:11,927 --> 01:43:12,859
Yeah.

1107
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:15,788
You peas in a pod...

1108
01:43:15,931 --> 01:43:18,331
We're your students.

1109
01:43:20,702 --> 01:43:25,730
Your words cut straight to the gut.

1110
01:43:26,375 --> 01:43:28,639
I still think about them.

1111
01:43:31,113 --> 01:43:32,876
You do, huh...

1112
01:43:39,721 --> 01:43:43,054
You stay the you we know.

1113
01:43:47,262 --> 01:43:48,593
Uchiyama...

1114
01:43:50,532 --> 01:43:53,865
Off to another day at work.

1115
01:43:54,202 --> 01:43:55,829
You be cool.

1116
01:43:58,373 --> 01:44:00,603
Thanks for waiting.

1117
01:44:00,776 --> 01:44:01,674
Let's go.

1118
01:44:09,918 --> 01:44:11,886
Bye, Uchiyama!

1119
01:44:12,988 --> 01:44:14,319
Thanks!

1120
01:44:45,087 --> 01:44:47,180
Good morning.

1121
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:49,122
Miss Yamaguchi!

1122
01:44:50,225 --> 01:44:52,159
I'm very sorry!

1123
01:44:52,527 --> 01:44:54,017
You're...

1124
01:44:54,496 --> 01:44:56,862
the pride of our school.

1125
01:45:00,702 --> 01:45:06,038
A teacher like you
so dedicated to her students

1126
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:09,302
is a principal's joy.

1127
01:45:10,345 --> 01:45:13,280
Thank you.

1128
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:19,718
What's happening?

1129
01:45:19,988 --> 01:45:22,718
The phones are ringing nonstop.

1130
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:25,321
There're tons of email too.

1131
01:45:25,494 --> 01:45:29,328
The whole country was moved by you.

1132
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:35,796
Our school achieved national fame.

1133
01:45:35,971 --> 01:45:39,270
We'll have more applicants next year.

1134
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:41,705
All thanks to Miss Yamaguchi.

1135
01:45:41,776 --> 01:45:43,073
Bravo.

1136
01:45:43,278 --> 01:45:45,940
You're being too kind.

1137
01:45:46,114 --> 01:45:47,911
She's right.

1138
01:45:51,853 --> 01:45:52,979
Director.

1139
01:45:53,488 --> 01:45:58,983
For whatever reason,
putting students in such danger

1140
01:45:59,161 --> 01:46:02,858
shows your inexperience as a teacher.

1141
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:04,823
Yes, ma'am.

1142
01:46:05,033 --> 01:46:08,799
You must do better from now.

1143
01:46:19,548 --> 01:46:24,042
It really was reckless of you.

1144
01:46:31,193 --> 01:46:32,319
One moment.

1145
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:38,490
Timely magazine wants to do an article on you.

1146
01:46:39,067 --> 01:46:40,227
An article?

1147
01:46:40,368 --> 01:46:41,835
I wanna be in it too.

1148
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:44,565
You can introduce your colleagues.

1149
01:46:45,207 --> 01:46:48,267
Wait a minute. Don't get so excited.

1150
01:46:48,476 --> 01:46:49,773
But it's a magazine article.

1151
01:46:49,911 --> 01:46:52,175
Miss Yamaguchi.

1152
01:46:54,015 --> 01:46:56,506
Don't get carried away.

1153
01:46:58,386 --> 01:47:02,152
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

1154
01:47:02,324 --> 01:47:03,518
I know.

1155
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,054
Do you really?

1156
01:47:05,227 --> 01:47:06,819
Yes, I do.

1157
01:47:06,928 --> 01:47:08,395
I've had to repeat myself.

1158
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:11,658
You're so persistent, Vice Principal.

1159
01:47:11,833 --> 01:47:12,561
- Principal.

1160
01:47:12,701 --> 01:47:13,463
- I know.

1161
01:47:13,635 --> 01:47:14,294
- You don't.

1162
01:47:14,436 --> 01:47:15,630
- I do.

1163
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:29,215
It's your last day here.

1164
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:32,377
Yes, thank you.

1165
01:47:33,521 --> 01:47:37,355
I heard you specifically requested

1166
01:47:37,425 --> 01:47:40,394
to be assigned here at Akado.

1167
01:47:43,765 --> 01:47:47,292
Did you find something?

1168
01:47:51,006 --> 01:47:55,568
Being a teacher isn't too bad.

1169
01:47:58,546 --> 01:47:59,740
I see.

1170
01:48:03,918 --> 01:48:05,442
Thank you.

1171
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:27,535
Today is Mr. Odagiri's last day.

1172
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:33,077
So...

1173
01:48:34,015 --> 01:48:39,385
we'll play Kick the Can to make memories.

1174
01:48:42,891 --> 01:48:44,882
Let's go!

1175
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:48,188
To the field!

1176
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:57,333
Where're you going?

1177
01:49:03,044 --> 01:49:04,511
Why not?!

1178
01:49:11,019 --> 01:49:12,884
Gotcha!

1179
01:49:16,591 --> 01:49:17,990
Where are they?

1180
01:49:29,471 --> 01:49:30,904
Gotcha!

1181
01:49:47,856 --> 01:49:48,982
Miss Yamaguchi!

1182
01:50:03,838 --> 01:50:05,066
Gotcha!

1183
01:50:22,757 --> 01:50:23,746
Yankumi.

1184
01:50:24,926 --> 01:50:26,086
Thanks.

1185
01:50:26,327 --> 01:50:27,521
What?

1186
01:50:28,363 --> 01:50:29,625
Nothing.

1187
01:50:31,966 --> 01:50:33,194
Odagiri.

1188
01:50:35,303 --> 01:50:40,832
If anything's troubling you,
come back anytime.

1189
01:50:44,679 --> 01:50:50,345
I'm your teacher until I die.

1190
01:51:01,896 --> 01:51:03,796
Watch out, Yankumi!

1191
01:51:04,265 --> 01:51:05,323
"Yankumi"?

1192
01:51:06,267 --> 01:51:08,531
Did you call me Yankumi?

1193
01:51:19,547 --> 01:51:24,143
Let's run into the sunset!

1194
01:51:36,764 --> 01:51:38,959
So, what sunset?

1195
01:52:15,036 --> 01:52:16,867
Go for it!

1196
01:52:20,275 --> 01:52:22,300
The glory days of youth.

1197
01:52:43,031 --> 01:52:47,400

1
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,802
Go on...

2
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,974
I said, pass ahead

3
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,149
Oh no, it's time for the wedding

4
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,485
And Father Li is not here yet

5
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,829
Hey, Cui, you must help us out

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,164
Or we're finished

7
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,983
The bride is here now

8
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,352
Few pages more...

9
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,654
Few pages more, keep going

10
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,285
Shit, you missed it

11
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,731
Turn back...

12
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,771
Lord, this is the day you take a rest

13
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,467
But there're still many people

14
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,977
who can't sit still and take a rest

15
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,172
So I decide to help them

16
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,580
by performing the shortest ceremony

17
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,717
From their eyes

18
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,987
I can see this couple

19
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:13,957
is sweet, romantic

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,988
sensual, hot, sexy, horny

21
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,622
Today I'm the godfather and your witness

22
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,566
You...

23
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:23,158
Guan Qimen

24
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,829
Guan Qimen, do you want to marry... who?

25
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,428
Bi Shizhu

26
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,471
Bi Shizhu as your wife?

27
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:28,302
Yes

28
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,903
Are you sure? Have you thought it
all over?

29
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,972
You're not forced to marry, right?

30
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,603
It's none of your business

31
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,578
You shut up

32
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,950
I just want to make sure

33
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,989
So they won't regret in the future, okay?

34
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,356
Do you really want to marry her?

35
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:51,227
I do, I really do, I terribly do

36
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,828
Okay, that's up to you

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,496
Bi Shizhu, I don't think I have to ask

38
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,968
You do want to marry him, right?

39
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,369
I do... I really do

40
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,943
Good, you've exchanged rings already

41
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,108
May God bless you

42
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:15,843
According to your village custom

43
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,889
If no one objects until I count to three

44
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,788
You're a legally married couple

45
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,223
Now I start counting

46
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,726
One

47
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,063
Two

48
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,391
Objection

49
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,062
I won't take my objection back

50
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,865
Stop the wedding, someone objects

51
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,363
Objection

52
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:33,768
I object to this marriage

53
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,272
Li Falong, what are you doing here?

54
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,269
Everyone in our village

55
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,710
knows my relationship with Qimen

56
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,906
And now you take him away from me

57
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,378
Qimen, answer me now

58
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,647
Do you want to marry this fat girl or me?

59
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,887
Answer me now

60
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,116
Falong, please don't insist

61
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,353
I have to listen to my father

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,960
Guan Qimen, you are so cruel

63
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,694
Look at you...

64
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,633
I knew you're forced to do this

65
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,402
Stop that, stop saying that

66
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:08,030
Get away, I'm performing the ceremony

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,869
Not you

68
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,500
Sister, don't worry. You're lucky

69
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,340
...to have me here

70
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,414
Tell me everything and I'll handle it

71
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,915
If I can't handle it, I'll find someone
instead

72
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,242
Bullshit, it's none of your business

73
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,852
Shut up, fat pig

74
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,479
Or I'll rape you

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,356
Please forgive me

76
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,863
I only have one son

77
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,560
It's me... I persuaded him to do this

78
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,432
Please let them get married

79
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,597
Falong, please...

80
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,277
Master Guan, please get up

81
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,745
I... I’m used to this

82
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,440
I'll forget everything after I get up

83
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,085
I'm lucky, every time I kneel down

84
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,654
They will forgive me

85
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,949
Falong, I'm so sorry about this

86
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,460
You must forgive me

87
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,963
You must be patient, be patient

88
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:09,558
My family is poor

89
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,263
I'm not a rich girl like her,
and I'm not that fat too

90
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,437
I won't blame her

91
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,203
I just blame God, it's so unfair

92
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,279
Oh God

93
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,733
Hold him tight

94
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,106
Kiss... tighter

95
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,703
Tight...

96
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,712
OK, Cut

97
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,180
Now I've got you

98
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,582
See, his pushes his tongue out

99
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,647
How's that?

100
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,153
We've kissed umpteen times, any good?

101
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,655
Hey, I told you to put in some passion

102
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,249
Passion? He's too passionate

103
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,419
He pushes his tongue out

104
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,292
And licks...

105
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,661
Hey bro, I just want to get into my role

106
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,927
and I have to pretend you are Anita Mui

107
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,434
Anita Mui doesn't have a figure
like mine, does she?

108
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,797
Well, you let her go have her own concert

109
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,965
So you have to be her stand-in

110
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,741
I'm just a production assistant

111
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,539
Why should I sell my beauty?

112
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,604
Oh, come on. Forget it

113
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,704
That's simple

114
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,445
I think you're getting lucky

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,247
Really? Getting lucky, huh?!

116
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,579
Some luck! Let's gather the props

117
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,457
This mink coat is borrowed from a shop

118
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,086
Handle it with great care,
it costs a fortune

119
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,027
If this mink coat is damaged

120
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,928
...we can't pay for it

121
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,828
Can't pay for it...

122
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,129
You're becoming a woman

123
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,540
That's not funny...

124
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,244
Brother, be careful

125
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,745
This costs a fortune, you can't afford it

126
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,282
This costs a fortune, Tuoxian

127
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,289
Shit...

128
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,462
Maybe this is still worth
a couple of dollars!

129
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,198
Look at this, what shall we do?

130
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,933
Use your brain

131
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:30,935
Nobody will sponsor you next time

132
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,172
Hey... there's a girl

133
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,083
Miss

134
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,310
Miss, did your car break down?

135
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,519
Mr., your car stops?

136
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,853
Miss, how can we help?

137
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,189
The battery is out

138
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,388
We have cables, we can help you
to recharge

139
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,991
Right, let's help her recharge

140
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,828
Really?

141
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,893
Watch out, or there'll be a short circuit

142
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:02,767
What happened to this mink coat?

143
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,177
Sun bathing. Borrowed from a shop
for shooting

144
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,637
It's not my fault

145
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:09,838
It's the bad luck of that shop

146
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,611
Do you think they will take
this thing back?

147
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,379
Why not?

148
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,978
We can convince the shop

149
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,420
to take the coat back

150
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,584
Miss, the battery is recharged

151
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,987
Thank you, good luck

152
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,762
Call me next time when you need a recharge

153
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,072
You look horny when you meet women

154
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:37,938
Almost mess up everything

155
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,568
That's my character

156
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,244
It's still wet, what should we do?

157
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:47,015
Don't worry, let's just waggle it
a few times

158
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,209
Let me try

159
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,694
Oh dear!

160
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:04,533
- Excuse me
- Hi

161
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,865
Could I please speak to the person
in charge?

162
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,432
Can I have your name?

163
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,404
I'm from the TV station

164
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:10,170
Betty, someone from the TV station
wants to see you

165
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,933
So you're Betty

166
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,240
I'm Guan Dianxi, a producer from
the TV station

167
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,743
We've borrowed two mink coats from
your shop

168
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,546
We're keeping one for Liza Wang

169
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,245
and returning the other one to you now

170
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,351
Oh, you didn't have to bring it back
in person

171
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,322
Thank you so much anyway

172
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,891
So you're Mr. Guan, right?

173
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,528
In fact, the reason I'm here today

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,427
is to apologize for our company

175
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:33,697
This mink coat...

176
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:37,263
It must be skin disease,
that's why the hair falls

177
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,669
Sorry, we've dropped it into the water

178
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,467
That's why it looks like this

179
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,399
This mink coat costs thousands of dollars

180
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,366
and now it looks like this

181
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,774
Nobody will even want it for free

182
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,075
We didn't do this on purpose

183
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,342
If you really want us to pay for it

184
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,007
You can take a portion from my
monthly salary

185
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,417
When I lend you the coat

186
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,282
I expected it might get dirty

187
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,855
But I never expected it to become
like this

188
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,517
Couldn't the fur be put back?

189
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,953
Maybe someone would want it

190
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,989
Excellent. This is a treasure

191
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,291
Never imagined to find a mink coat
like this one

192
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,563
Miss... please let me have this mink coat

193
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,638
Because my wife wants to have

194
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,433
a very unique mink coat

195
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,508
And this one is extremely unique

196
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,809
I have to buy it no matter how
expensive it is

197
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,572
Sir, the fur is falling off from this coat

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,772
Do you still want it?

199
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,907
You're insulting the designer of
this mink coat

200
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,185
Falling fur means free

201
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,580
Torn-down means romantic

202
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,356
The two bunches of fur here means
it's genuine

203
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,122
And you're a person who knows
nothing about mink coats

204
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:37,961
Where's your boss?

205
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:38,928
This is our boss

206
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,459
She?

207
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,225
Yes

208
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,799
You're beautiful, and you have taste

209
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,071
You have such a unique mink coat
in your shop

210
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,902
You have only one, if I'm right

211
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:50,942
You know a lot

212
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,510
That's why I think you have taste

213
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,242
Please wrap it up

214
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:55,511
I'll pay whatever the price

215
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,685
I've forgotten my wallet. Alright...

216
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,053
please keep it for me,
I'll come back later

217
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:07,959
Don't sell it to others

218
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,152
I'll keep it for you

219
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:11,729
Now it's sold and I don't have
to compensate

220
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,259
I never said anything about compensation

221
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,165
I should say thanks to you guys

222
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,398
for helping my sister with her car

223
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,003
Hey...

224
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,046
You've told her everything

225
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,114
That's obvious

226
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,579
I'd rather die now

227
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:50,702
It's Mrs. Guan

228
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,269
Right

229
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,132
Let's go over

230
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,133
Mrs. Guan

231
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,539
Why are you carrying all those boxes
yourself?

232
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,468
You can afford so many luxuries

233
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,637
Why don't you get a maid as well?

234
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,180
Forget it. Had these been luxury items

235
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,408
...the department store would
deliver them

236
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,178
You don't have to take them home yourself

237
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,583
I bought a mink coat,
just 30 thousand dollars

238
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,815
I'm afraid of being robbed
so I'm taking it home myself

239
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,391
I can wear it to attend wedding banquets

240
00:13:14,026 --> 00:13:15,755
I'm making braised jumbo abalone at home

241
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,522
You might come have a look when it's ready

242
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,998
You're so nice

243
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,259
Don't say that

244
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,994
I just ask you to come and have a look

245
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,696
Only few people have seen jumbo abalone

246
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,995
Open the door

247
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,087
Okay, coming...

248
00:13:58,537 --> 00:13:59,299
You're coming back with all those
boxes again

249
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,064
I'm back

250
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,662
Why bring all my clothes inside?

251
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,901
It's going to rain, so I brought them in

252
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,308
I bring...

253
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,471
Pick them up for me

254
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,880
Be careful, I still want them

255
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:15,816
I'm so tired

256
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,882
Bricks again. Stop pretending we're rich

257
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:19,950
People will find out the truth
sooner or later

258
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,083
You think I enjoy this, don't you?

259
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,184
When I married you

260
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,456
I thought I would live a well off life

261
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,293
But I soon realized this is not the case

262
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:28,696
You've spent all my money

263
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,234
And I have to endure all the hardships
with you

264
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,098
I do this because

265
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,467
I don't want people looking down on you

266
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,130
Go and make some money if you can

267
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,833
Right, it's all my fault

268
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,070
Don't forget

269
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:40,236
You were the one dying to marry me

270
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,211
Right, I was chasing after you

271
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:43,508
I want to keep pestering you
for the rest of my life

272
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,913
I want you to feel guilty

273
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,679
To be sneered by the whole world

274
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,846
To be punished by God and the universe

275
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:52,989
It's too abstract, I don't understand

276
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,688
You're being theatrical

277
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,665
You really want to go up and expose her?

278
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,023
It'll be very embarrassing

279
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,295
Only she will be embarrassed

280
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,495
She always jeers & makes fun of us

281
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,506
Buying a mink coat? She can't afford it

282
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,275
It's getting cold

283
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,744
I've got you a cotton coat today

284
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,143
It seems used

285
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,777
Can you afford a new one?

286
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,511
I got it from my third uncle's
fourth uncle's

287
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:21,847
seventh uncle

288
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,119
He wanted to throw this away

289
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,986
But it still looks new so I bring it back

290
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,389
Seventh uncle? Didn't he died of AIDS?

291
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,291
You keep it

292
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,988
I bought it, you idiot

293
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,896
Then why there's no wrapping?

294
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,864
They're from a street vendor

295
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,401
And you expect wrapping

296
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,295
Help me pick them up, hurry...

297
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,368
How come they're here so soon?

298
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,841
The jumbo abalone is not ready yet

299
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,676
We are not here to see the jumbo abalone

300
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,480
So you want to see the jumbo abalone

301
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,179
Round buns, sweet buns

302
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,615
It's jumbo, not dumble

303
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,385
Mr. Guan, you are so funny

304
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,657
Actually we aren't here for the
jumbo abalone

305
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:00,384
We came by to see the mink coat

306
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,090
They're here to see the mink coat

307
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,855
Then bring out the mink coat

308
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:08,190
Why it's empty?

309
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,428
The boxes seemed heavy when you're
carrying them

310
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:12,731
How did they become so light?

311
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:14,135
Maybe there are only bricks inside

312
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,503
In fact...

313
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:17,268
Mom, this is the mink coat

314
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:18,343
Only 30 thousand dollars, what a bargain

315
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,207
Sure

316
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,178
I buy several mink coats every year

317
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:24,647
The shop would give me a discount for sure

318
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
But some people can't even get
to touch one

319
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,054
You two are lucky

320
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,987
You just touched my boxes

321
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:36,255
Even the boxes are expensive,
one hundred dollars each

322
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,229
Well, those who never touch such
valuable items

323
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,356
will be overwhelmed for sure

324
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,896
Mrs. Guan, please put it on

325
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,530
and let us broaden our view

326
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,242
Sure. One should be humble

327
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,005
so you will live longer

328
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,876
Son, help me put on the coat

329
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,278
and let them have a look

330
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,885
See, I look slim when I'm wearing
this coat

331
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,486
Wow... that's beautiful

332
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:08,986
Take a good look at it

333
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:12,355
What's the matter?

334
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:13,863
What are you doing?

335
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,357
What's the matter?

336
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:18,960
What's wrong with you?

337
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,362
This is "Back-rubbing dance"

338
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,909
Bull shit

339
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:27,043
Are you crazy?

340
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,704
How come I feel itchy on my back?

341
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,476
I see, this coat is for Liza Wang

342
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,244
This must be from the wardrobe

343
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,417
Yes, this is Liza Wang's mink coat

344
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,422
But my mom bought it back from Liza Wang

345
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,789
last year at a charity ball

346
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,325
My mom made a donation but don't want
others know

347
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,125
So she said she bought this coat

348
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,958
Isn't my mom great?

349
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:53,630
Zhu, I thought you're wasting my money

350
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,469
Now I know you have such a kind heart

351
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,608
I've misunderstood you

352
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,109
I have insulted you

353
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,509
I feel very very sorry

354
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,907
You can yell at me, you can beat me up

355
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,745
Harder, it doesn't matter

356
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,716
Mrs. Guan, we're so sorry

357
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:10,618
We misunderstood you

358
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,353
It's all your fault, you insist to
expose her

359
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,050
and you expose shit

360
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,994
Mrs. Guan, you're such a kind
hearted person

361
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,792
God will bless you and your family

362
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,058
and bring good fortune to you

363
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:21,962
Let's go...

364
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,863
I'm sorry

365
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,428
It's over now, let's have dinner

366
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,303
See, how can I leave

367
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,206
such a supportive husband like you?

368
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,371
And I have such a filial son

369
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,414
I feel happy even though I am not rich

370
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,808
Dad, your acting skill is getting better

371
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:41,146
Maybe you should take up some
guest roles later

372
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,482
I do this for your mom all the time

373
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,056
I'll get an Oscar sooner or later

374
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,280
Mom, don't do this again

375
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,423
Your mom loves to boast, that's her
character

376
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,532
Sorry, I've just come out from a meeting

377
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:02,763
It's okay for production people to be late

378
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,308
If an actor was late...

379
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,273
he would lose his job tomorrow

380
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,808
It depends on who the person is

381
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,909
If you were that actor, I wouldn't do that

382
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,079
So how may I help? Must be bad news

383
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,744
You're such a smart beauty

384
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,548
If you were an actor, you would be
the most popular

385
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:18,655
Cut the crap

386
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,985
My sister is waiting in the studio

387
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,925
Well, our TV station

388
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,690
is going to have a superwife competition

389
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:26,786
I want you to sponsor

390
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,730
some mink coats

391
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:30,625
You dare ask me to be your sponsor again?

392
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:31,665
What's wrong?

393
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,102
Well, since you bring this up

394
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,002
Then I'll tell you the truth

395
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,500
Hurry, time's up

396
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,407
Coming... I’m dead tired

397
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,377
Why do so many aspire to be an actor?

398
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:43,914
Hey, let them in

399
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:44,641
Yes

400
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,011
You go to act with those newbies

401
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,143
Why me again?

402
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:49,743
Last time I was the stand-in...

403
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,413
Don't bring it up again

404
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,717
The problem isn't solved yet

405
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:54,386
Director

406
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:55,555
Over there

407
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,856
Who's the director, please?

408
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,459
What do you want?

409
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,730
I'm here for the screen test

410
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,060
Sorry, please wait a minute

411
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,474
My name is Mei Chuhong

412
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,303
I've received many awards, see,
plenty of them

413
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,879
I've joined many contests

414
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,379
Such as ballet dancing contest

415
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:21,509
Singing contest

416
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,349
Piano contest

417
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,979
And I'm a top swimmer

418
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,455
This is called the breast stroke, my best

419
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:31,526
Take her to do the screen test now

420
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,829
Let her keep swimming for a while

421
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,633
I'm finished

422
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,759
This is your dialogue

423
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,067
Thank you

424
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,469
Let's go

425
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,164
Director...

426
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:44,538
Should I face the camera?

427
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,075
Yes

428
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,166
Yes... you have to

429
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,545
Director, please give me a start signal

430
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,675
Okay, start

431
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,011
Ladies and gentlemen

432
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,119
Hi... tonight I want to introduce
to you all

433
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,593
a very famous drama

434
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,924
It's called the Fisherman...

435
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:09,864
Fisherman Killer

436
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,368
Director, why a fisherman kills
the chicken?

437
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,571
It's called Fisherman Killer

438
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,040
Oh, this sounds strange

439
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,506
Nothing strange, you just say it again

440
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,542
Buy why a fisherman

441
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,814
is also a killer?

442
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:31,849
He's so cruel

443
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,417
Okay, stop it

444
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,322
Do the prisoner act now

445
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,155
Thank you

446
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:38,821
Come here...

447
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,357
Now you're a prisoner

448
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,559
I'm your lover and coming to visit you

449
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:44,499
You should look miserable

450
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,069
Okay

451
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,293
Ready?

452
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:46,837
I'm ready

453
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:47,870
You are ready

454
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:48,769
Action

455
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,909
I know... you don't love a person

456
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,710
like me

457
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,009
I'm biologically prepared

458
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:09,454
No, I mean... psychologically

459
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,262
I mean psychologically prepared

460
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,261
Should I start all over again?

461
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,667
No. I am going to study abroad

462
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:21,697
I trusted you with my virginity

463
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,105
You're heartless

464
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:26,109
And leave me behind the bars

465
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,045
I will tell the warden about this

466
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,914
Okay...

467
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,011
Director, my acting is very good,
isn't it?

468
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,880
Go home now, we'll send you a letter

469
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,824
Sure, bye bye

470
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,561
Please kill me now...

471
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,157
Oh, I almost forgot

472
00:22:50,268 --> 00:22:51,735
Is the haunted house set ready yet?

473
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,998
It's ready. That janitor is very nice

474
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,471
He said we can go there any time we want

475
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,400
Do you want a vacation there?

476
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,135
Guan Dianxi, the producer is
looking for you

477
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,344
He wants to see you, go now

478
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:03,912
Next

479
00:23:05,617 --> 00:23:06,413
Did you ask for me, sir?

480
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,287
Do you know how much is this bag?

481
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:13,816
I don't

482
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,360
Of course you don't.
It's several thousand dollars

483
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,520
You can't afford such a luxury item

484
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,192
So what?

485
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,167
So what? You can't even afford
this leather bag

486
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,758
How dare you damage a
thirty-thousand-dollar mink coat

487
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,233
I see, someone is here to make a complaint

488
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,105
I'm not here to make a complaint

489
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,411
Not a complaint but the facts

490
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,372
I don't mind you damaged the coat,
but you lied

491
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,817
Don't you know that lying

492
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,408
is immoral and dirty?

493
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,821
What kind of penalty should he get?

494
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,322
Let him get some copying punishment

495
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:47,415
Good idea

496
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,949
What should he copy?

497
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,955
Copy "I am a dirty scoundrel,

498
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:54,963
I'll never lie again" a thousand times

499
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,433
That's fantastic

500
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,367
Do it now

501
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:00,995
Not him, I mean you

502
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:01,731
Why?

503
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,368
Why? That bag is a fake

504
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:06,501
Just one look says it's from a
street vendor

505
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,181
You're a liar, a hypocrite

506
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,488
Excuse me

507
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,578
No, not me

508
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:04,991
Sister

509
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,937
You know, he's teasing me

510
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:09,704
Tuoxian, they've offered us great help

511
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,036
and you're teasing her

512
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,770
Oh, just kiddin' around

513
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,203
Do you do this all the time?

514
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,307
My name is Shang Tuoxian

515
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,404
No time for jokes, you better offer
some help

516
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,005
Betty is looking for a place to do
a photo shoot

517
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,142
for a magazine cover, you've something
in mind?

518
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,518
Piece of cake

519
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,186
Dianxi, phone call

520
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,381
Coming... you have a chat

521
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,115
Go now...

522
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:26,952
Thanks

523
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:28,684
What kind of place you are looking for?

524
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,552
Something special, a villa,
to do a photo shoot

525
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:33,760
You've found the right guy

526
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,165
Dianxi has a villa

527
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,792
Really?

528
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:38,931
He's rich, is it?

529
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,598
His grandpa is a real estate tycoon

530
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,902
He works here just for fun

531
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:44,737
You should ask him

532
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,259
Falong...

533
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,998
Falong...

534
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,035
Falong

535
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,439
It's you

536
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:21,339
I thought I would never see you again

537
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,005
This is destiny, we had to see
each other again

538
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:29,349
Look at you, your hair turns all white

539
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,515
My son said white hair is popular now

540
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,252
So I sort of greyed my hair

541
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,160
I see. How many kids do you have?

542
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,526
Well, just one

543
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,967
I thought fat women bear many kids

544
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,834
Anyway, you married her

545
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,031
You should not complain

546
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:53,802
Shizhu is coming

547
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:58,513
C'mon, let's get inside

548
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,878
Qimen

549
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,956
Qimen

550
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:14,622
Qimen...

551
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,031
It's such fun to see her getting angry

552
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:20,904
She will slap your head with her slipper

553
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,799
When she got angry, she used to slap me

554
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:24,897
with her slipper, remember that?

555
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,674
You always quarreled with her

556
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,246
Right, I used to quarrel with her

557
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,939
While rubbing your head at the same time

558
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,012
If fact it didn't hurt, I was used to it

559
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,477
So you were pretending

560
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,444
I just wanted to seek your attention

561
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,081
Who asked you look so nervous!

562
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:41,283
Oh... no...

563
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:42,585
Crazy old man

564
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,755
We're old people now

565
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,233
Let's stop talking about the past

566
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:52,128
So how are you doing now?

567
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,332
I heard you'd married a rich guy

568
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,768
He died two years ago

569
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:58,606
That's great

570
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,201
How many kids do you have?

571
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,447
I...

572
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,114
I have to get off now

573
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,250
How can I contact you?

574
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,094
Madam, you're back

575
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:21,690
Close the door

576
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,400
Any phone calls for me today?

577
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:26,060
No

578
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,770
The girls are not at home, right?

579
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,810
Happy Birthday To You

580
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,140
Happy Birthday To You

581
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:43,610
Happy Birthday To You, Mother

582
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,090
Happy Birthday To You

583
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,288
Happy birthday

584
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,661
What are you two doing?

585
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:56,331
Mom, today is your birthday

586
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,231
Yes, according to the western calendar

587
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,667
Just the two of us celebrate it with you

588
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,996
Let's have a banquet next month
for the lunar birthday

589
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:02,596
Right

590
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,032
I almost forget my birthday

591
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,542
You two are good girls

592
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,605
How do you want to celebrate?

593
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:09,304
Tell us

594
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,507
I don't want to have a banquet this year

595
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,841
Invite some old friends for dinner
should be fine

596
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,044
Just a casual dinner party

597
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,415
Sis, you don't have to spend a fortune

598
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,018
Mom is saving your money

599
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:21,589
Right, so let me buy a luxurious gift

600
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:23,092
for you

601
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:24,024
Good

602
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,825
I've bought you the piles ointment
you asked for

603
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,421
It's in that bag

604
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,158
Thanks, madam

605
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,626
Why you want this ointment?

606
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,267
Not me, it's for my husband

607
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:38,201
Oh, this is just skin cream

608
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,669
Qimen, my skin feels tight

609
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,214
Apply more cream. It would be fine

610
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,846
It smells funny

611
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,547
Don't be silly

612
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,746
Only the genuine stuff smells funny

613
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,322
Fermented bean curd stinks too

614
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,822
But it tastes good

615
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,688
You can put this on your face
and eat it too

616
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,729
It makes your body smooth,
not just your face

617
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:00,926
How should I eat it?

618
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,924
Scoop it up and put it in your mouth

619
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:03,523
Oh

620
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,240
It tastes funny

621
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,176
Are you sure I can eat this?

622
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,581
Let me look up the usage booklet

623
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,883
You won't understand, let me have a look

624
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,647
No need

625
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,347
Give it to me

626
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,013
Forget it

627
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:29,056
Piles ointment

628
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,521
It's that Falong!

629
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,790
You two do this together to make fun of me

630
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,865
I'm not sure if she took my bag

631
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,228
Or I took her bag

632
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,802
I thought she'd have killed herself
already

633
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,069
Stop cursing her

634
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,866
Her husband died, it's very unfortunate

635
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,497
Unfortunate? It's good for you

636
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:44,575
You can marry her now

637
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:47,571
So I can torture her to death

638
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,007
It's beautiful

639
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:56,544
You put me into shit now

640
00:30:56,654 --> 00:30:57,177
Why?

641
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,915
If she found out this villa was not mine

642
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,081
...wouldn't I lose face?

643
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,818
Well, I don't know your families

644
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:03,223
And it is rented by our company

645
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,556
It's okay to take a look around

646
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:07,730
She wants to take cover photos,
don't you know?

647
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,265
Then tell her your villa is
undergoing renovation

648
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,597
You're really stupid

649
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,736
This villa is quite interesting

650
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:16,869
I'm sure the photos will be unique

651
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,805
Yes

652
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,304
I hope so

653
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,239
Bobo, it's even better upstairs

654
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,974
Come... let me show you around

655
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,049
You come here often?

656
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,341
Oh, with girls?

657
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,449
Nonsense

658
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,884
It's quiet here, Dianxi and I often
come here

659
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,480
to write screenplays, come...

660
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,187
It's very spacious outside

661
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,392
Yes... let me show you around

662
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,035
Where's all your family?

663
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,998
They don't live here, this is our
vacation house

664
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,134
Is that so? We have a vacation house too

665
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,609
It's on an outlying island,
you should come some time

666
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:57,106
Great. Do you live with your father?

667
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,147
My father passed away a long time ago

668
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,309
I'm sorry

669
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,388
It's okay, mom loves us very much

670
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,719
She always says it's important
to be honest

671
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,382
And don't pretend to be what you're not

672
00:32:08,493 --> 00:32:10,723
She appreciates people like you...

673
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,159
who depend on their own abilities

674
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,162
Really? I appreciate myself too

675
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,734
How come all the plants have withered?

676
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:18,802
Nobody takes care of them?

677
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,632
Movie locations are all like this

678
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,568
What?

679
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:25,065
Oh, I mean he always lends out
this place for shootings

680
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,201
It's out of shape because
he doesn't take care of it

681
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,978
Let's help him water the plants

682
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,312
Okay

683
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,041
Let's go

684
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,649
Your sister is pretty outgoing

685
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,712
She only knows how to have fun

686
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,789
Mom is going to send her away to study

687
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,551
You are lucky to have a nice mom

688
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,555
Your mom doesn't care about you?

689
00:32:44,162 --> 00:32:46,756
My mom loves to...

690
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,425
break traditions and gives us space
to develop

691
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,399
To do whatever we want to do

692
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:03,811
How come there's no water?

693
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:06,013
No water? Impossible

694
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,913
No water? Impossible...

695
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,416
Oh, my camera

696
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:19,756
What's the matter?

697
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:20,922
My camera is in the water

698
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:25,995
Come on

699
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,268
Come on

700
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,072
Sorry. Thank you very much

701
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:41,812
So... rry, it's... freezing,
I haven't got it

702
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:44,653
Doesn't matter

703
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:51,354
I'm sorry, don't catch a cold

704
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,690
Here, take this

705
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:56,925
Even if I froze to death it's worth it

706
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:03,401
Thank you

707
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,175
Do you have a camera?

708
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:12,783
Yes

709
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:14,713
Wait

710
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,187
"The Guan Clansfolk Association"

711
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:19,850
Hurry up

712
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,091
Shizhu, long time no see, how are you?

713
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,032
Which floor?

714
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,433
The Guan banquet

715
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:34,599
Third floor

716
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,800
Wait, wait

717
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,098
I'm sorry

718
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,677
7th Auntie, I'm Shizhu

719
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:41,676
Shizhu

720
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:42,939
This is my husband Qimen

721
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,270
Qimen

722
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,849
I'm Falong

723
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,510
Falong, it's you. Long time no see

724
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,109
I didn't see you at...

725
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,745
our annual clan banquet

726
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:53,255
Guessed you might have immigrated perhaps

727
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,456
I've lost contact with you

728
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,460
If Qimen didn't tell me about this

729
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,052
I would not see you again tonight

730
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,721
So you two still keep in contact

731
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:05,135
Girls, we're not young anymore

732
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,227
Just listen to your auntie

733
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,863
Let the bygones be bygone

734
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:10,963
Qimen, don't you think so?

735
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,372
The Guan banquet

736
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,307
Here we are

737
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,345
You can't hide it from your auntie

738
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,542
Falong and Shizhu, the two of them

739
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:22,141
always picking a fight with each other

740
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:24,346
You should solve this

741
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,188
Auntie, how can I solve this

742
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,349
One of them is a dog and the other
is a cat

743
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,427
Both of them will tear me apart

744
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,162
Then let me be the peacemaker

745
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,156
My hands are itching

746
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:37,132
Falong, it's still early,
let's play mahjong

747
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,032
Not enough people

748
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,736
That's not a problem

749
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,174
Shizhu, you, me, and we have only
to find one more

750
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,976
Maybe she doesn't want to play

751
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,675
I will definitely play no matter what

752
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,644
I don't have any hobby

753
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:54,343
Playing mahjong with young people
is my only favorite

754
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,817
I'm not very good at playing mahjong

755
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,855
Then don't play, or you'll lose
all your money

756
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,789
I won't lose all my money

757
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,423
One Circle

758
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,023
Everyone is in harmony

759
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,561
Forty Thousand

760
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,664
All in the same pattern

761
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:15,763
Nine Stripes

762
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:16,669
You're lying

763
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,207
Eight Circles

764
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,510
Do you want it? Thirty Thousand

765
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:29,617
Pong

766
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,096
Just having some solitary fun

767
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:45,497
What are you doing here?

768
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,501
My hands are itching, I want to play

769
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:48,731
I've said I'll never play mahjong again

770
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,198
When I give it a slap, it doesn't
want to play

771
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,173
Don't play, don't play...

772
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:53,368
Nuts

773
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:56,037
No, you can't discard this

774
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,083
One Stripe

775
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,980
We three are winners

776
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,215
No need to be so excited, it's only a game

777
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,049
You're so troublesome

778
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,524
Whatever you discard, you are losing

779
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:10,992
So why keep choosing the tiles?

780
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,926
Why discard it if you knew
she wants this tile?

781
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:17,057
I like to do it, so what?

782
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,893
The models are good

783
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,363
Of course. Otherwise

784
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:22,939
they can't wear your beautiful mink coats

785
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,330
Thanks for your help

786
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,604
I'm sure this show will be a great success

787
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:28,940
It's because you've offered great help

788
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:29,910
That's nothing

789
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,478
Oh, where is the show held?

790
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,310
It's in Dianxi's villa

791
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,351
What? He has a villa?

792
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,216
Don't you know? Its very beautiful

793
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,955
If he had a villa then everyone
in this world is rich

794
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,588
He still owes me two hundred dollars

795
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:46,254
He's really smart.
You do believe him, don't you?

796
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,388
He won't lie to me

797
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:48,396
You're so naive

798
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,333
Okay

799
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,994
Dianxi...

800
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,401
Yeah, who's it?

801
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:55,267
Producer Tsang

802
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,439
Have you lent a villa to someone
to do a show?

803
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,466
Right, how do you know that?

804
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,512
Isn't that the one we rented for shooting?

805
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,602
It costs two thousand dollars a day

806
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,242
Right

807
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,247
It's exclusively for our use,
how can you lend it?

808
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,341
I just want to...

809
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,977
Producer, don't worry

810
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:12,385
Dianxi wants it to flirt with girls

811
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,980
I won't lend him the house

812
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:15,023
I've turned him down

813
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,321
He has even asked that girl out
for dinner tonight

814
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,823
Dianxi, you'll hurt the girl...

815
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:23,729
if she find out the truth

816
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,664
I...

817
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,703
How would she know?

818
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,668
If you don't tell and I don't tell

819
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,069
Dianxi won't tell either

820
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,232
Then she will never know, right?

821
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:35,602
Producer...

822
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,575
It's over now

823
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:54,560
What's mom doing here?

824
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,293
Probably having a seizure

825
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,760
You're cursing me

826
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,000
Dressed up for a banquet, is it?

827
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:04,267
I have a date. Dad, see you

828
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,103
See you, mom

829
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,246
Hey, what's that girl look like?

830
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,975
You always call me stupid

831
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,812
But I overheard him on the phone

832
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,818
He's seeing that girl at the Stanley Cafe

833
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,114
You should go and take a look

834
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,313
Stanley Cafe

835
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:22,987
Thank you

836
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,328
Thank you

837
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,393
Guan Dianxi

838
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:33,629
Hi, Tom

839
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,837
Long time no see. You never come
to reunion parties

840
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:38,408
How are you doing?

841
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,168
Fine

842
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,338
Hey, I hear you've been seeing a showgirl

843
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:42,878
Is that true?

844
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,004
Yes, she's over there

845
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,742
She's pregnant, we're getting married

846
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,181
I've brought her to speak to my mom today

847
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,449
And yes, she's dying to get into showbiz

848
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,486
You could recommend her perhaps

849
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,817
I want her to do something dignified

850
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:53,713
Okay

851
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:54,916
Come here, let me introduce you

852
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:55,491
No, don't

853
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,924
Come here, come

854
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,124
Come over...

855
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:02,031
You are back finally

856
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,559
What's he doing here?

857
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,863
He's my schoolmate Dianxi

858
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,494
A TV producer

859
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,072
If you want to be an actress, talk to him

860
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,101
Sorry, have to go back

861
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:13,608
I want to make a phone call. Sit

862
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,801
So you're a TV producer

863
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,169
Which TV station are you with?

864
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:18,937
Tri-color station

865
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:26,551
Director, I like acting very much

866
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,681
Please give me a chance

867
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,427
Do you really want to get into acting?

868
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,396
There's a best role for you

869
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,389
Really? What's that?

870
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:39,328
Enchanted ghost

871
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:42,969
You're awful

872
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,644
You've promised. Let's cross fingers

873
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:49,770
Don't lie to me

874
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,412
Please let me know
when the shooting starts

875
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:53,540
Don't worry, I'll let you know

876
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,777
Then you should jot down my phone number

877
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:55,943
My phone number is...

878
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,918
Sorry, I have to go to toilet first

879
00:40:58,022 --> 00:40:59,990
I'll note it down when I come back. Okay?

880
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,221
Hey

881
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,196
My son has such bad taste

882
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,768
and goes for a girl like you

883
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,400
You're not bad too

884
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,539
Sure. How long have you been with my son?

885
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,576
More than two years

886
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,549
Such a long time

887
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,021
We've been living together for
more than a year

888
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,621
He's been living with a woman

889
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:36,784
and I don't know about it

890
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,127
It's because you don't care about your son

891
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:45,231
Maybe you're right. I seldom talk to him

892
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,668
He loves to fool around with women

893
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:51,434
Now he's fooling around with you.
You're lucky

894
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,174
What's so lucky about me?

895
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,204
He told me he had AIDS

896
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,111
and asked me to give him money
for treatment

897
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:02,515
I don't have any money.
Maybe you can help him

898
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,985
Scared? Go get a check up

899
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:14,189
If I were you, I would leave him
immediately

900
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:16,289
So the next generation won't get the virus

901
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,459
Go now, be a good girl

902
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:22,663
So what you really want is...

903
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:24,331
to make me leave your son, right?

904
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,274
Fat pig

905
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,005
I've already used such schemes

906
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,814
Want me to leave him? Forget it

907
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:32,940
You go to hell

908
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,575
Bitch, don't you dare yell at me

909
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:36,846
Which club are you working at?

910
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:38,854
Who is your boss?

911
00:42:39,156 --> 00:42:39,952
Talking of old times,

912
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,184
when I was working at MGM club

913
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:43,851
You were not born yet

914
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,360
Now you are so lucky

915
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,394
you can work in Singapore club

916
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,021
And don't have to work in a sleazy bar

917
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,101
Or become a hooker. You're really lucky

918
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,803
You pregnant? Don't lie to me

919
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,803
What are you doing? Let go

920
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,540
What are you doing? Let go

921
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:58,640
I feel really upset

922
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,107
Let go of me

923
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:02,135
- You shameless
- Mom

924
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,372
I want to teach you a lesson

925
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,469
Mom... let go

926
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,742
- Let go
- Mom

927
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,440
Ling, what happened?

928
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,017
Your mom wants to have a fight with me

929
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:09,210
So let's have a fight with her

930
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,150
You think I'm afraid of her, don't you?

931
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,949
You fat pig, come here

932
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:12,818
What has my wife done to you?

933
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,753
She's not your mom

934
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,291
She's my mom, let's cool down and talk

935
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,123
Dianxi, she is your girlfriend, isn't she?

936
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,461
No, she's not here yet

937
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,835
I'm sorry... you're a respectful girl

938
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,131
I'm a pig...

939
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,899
Mom, forget it, let's go

940
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,835
Mom, why are you doing this?

941
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,380
I'm eager to see your girlfriend

942
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,474
You've messed up everything

943
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:41,916
How come she's not here yet?

944
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,547
The one who should be here isn't;
instead, you are!

945
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:45,644
Excuse me, bill please

946
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,490
You don't want to wait for her?

947
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,353
You keep waiting here

948
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,282
Son

949
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,030
Betty...

950
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,936
You're putting on airs, or throwing
tantrums

951
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,099
I've been waiting for you
in the cafe for two hours

952
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,143
I'm pretty calm and instead
you're putting on airs

953
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,506
We're just casual friends

954
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,011
We don't have to be honest to each other

955
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,945
Don't have to be responsible to each other

956
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,141
What do you mean?

957
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,241
Think about the villa and you'll know

958
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:17,383
My villa?

959
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,290
Betty, there's something you don't
understand

960
00:44:20,391 --> 00:44:22,325
Right, I won't understand

961
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,757
I won't understand till I die

962
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:25,786
I...

963
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:29,661
What do you want?

964
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,568
Nothing. At least have a good memory
before breakup

965
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:34,398
Hop in

966
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:43,870
My heart, full of love, is broken quietly

967
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,608
Leaving the forbidden zone of love

968
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:56,490
My heart wanders into a hopeless slumber

969
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,427
Coz I don't want to think about you
all the time

970
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,633
Come on out

971
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,402
What are you doing?

972
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,363
I'm taking you to my private villa

973
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:10,838
You still keep boasting?

974
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,101
I'm not boasting

975
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,006
Not only you rich people have villas

976
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,442
We poor people also have villas

977
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:17,041
These are our villas

978
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:18,136
They are not cheap ones either

979
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:19,978
Your villas have gardens

980
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,551
We have a garden here

981
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,949
You have gardeners

982
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,180
We have workers from the
housing department

983
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,853
You have dinning rooms

984
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,686
We have restaurants and cafes

985
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:30,521
You have big kitchens and fridges

986
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:31,855
We have even more

987
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:35,495
There are 7-11s and supermarkets

988
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,226
We have everything we want

989
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:38,827
Just have to pay

990
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:40,295
I'm no good

991
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:41,462
But I am willing to admit my fault

992
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,132
Yes, that villa is used for shootings

993
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,410
We're scoundrels, we're shit

994
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,503
Pretending we're from rich families

995
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:51,979
Thank you for believing in me

996
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,310
Now you know everything

997
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,714
It's better you find it out before you die

998
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,415
Hey, won't you take me to see your villa?

999
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,128
Dianxi

1000
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,340
Hey, mister...

1001
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,877
Please ask the man next to you to get off

1002
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,244
I want to talk to him

1003
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:26,714
Him?

1004
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,476
Yes

1005
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,309
Mister, that lady wants to talk to you

1006
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:37,856
No response

1007
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,922
You ignore me, huh? Let me play
a trick on you

1008
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:44,098
Dianxi, I'm wrong

1009
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,102
Please forgive me, I know it's my fault

1010
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,398
Let's talk about it

1011
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:52,037
Dianxi, I'm wrong

1012
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,508
Please forgive me, I know it's my fault

1013
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:55,600
Let's talk about it

1014
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:58,378
You can ignore me, but not the little one

1015
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,647
I am having your baby

1016
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,187
You can ignore me, but not the little one

1017
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:07,086
I... I am having your baby

1018
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,394
If you don't want it

1019
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,630
I won't blame you, I'll have an abortion

1020
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:25,602
If you don't want it

1021
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,307
I won't blame you

1022
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,678
I'll have an abortion

1023
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:40,146
If you still have heart

1024
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,417
please get off

1025
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,461
That's right. If you still have heart

1026
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,522
please, please get off

1027
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:00,637
Stop

1028
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,042
Save it for baby's milk

1029
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:11,220
Thank you everyone... thank you

1030
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,357
Let's go

1031
00:48:24,801 --> 00:48:26,359
Happy birthday...

1032
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,334
Mother... cut the cake

1033
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:28,461
Wait...

1034
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,872
Auntie, this is from me and Tuoxian

1035
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:32,373
Yes

1036
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:33,238
Right

1037
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:35,703
So nice of you!

1038
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:36,836
Just a small present

1039
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,876
I know

1040
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,383
You're bribing me, right?

1041
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:44,017
Auntie, you're exceedingly charming

1042
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,747
Mother, don't listen to their sweet talk

1043
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:48,722
Oh, come on!

1044
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,849
Come on... cut the cake

1045
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,087
Madam, a guest is here

1046
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:54,623
Must be Fatty

1047
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,366
Auntie, happy birthday

1048
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,498
Why are you so late?

1049
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,630
I'm busy, there are so many cases
to handle

1050
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:04,502
That's why I'm late

1051
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,737
That's alright. Come on in

1052
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,204
Betty, who's that guy?

1053
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,076
He's my cousin Killer Song

1054
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:13,240
Killer Xiong, the one whose ear
was bitten away

1055
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,840
last year in a prison riot

1056
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:15,912
That's his elder brother

1057
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:18,980
Bobo

1058
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:20,588
Your cousin is here

1059
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,658
Cousin

1060
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:22,753
Hi

1061
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:23,985
Hi, Betty

1062
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,893
Hi, Bobo

1063
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,094
Cousin

1064
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,899
I'm Shang Tuoxian, how are you?

1065
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,841
They are both our friends

1066
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,466
Both are TV producers

1067
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,211
I'm Guan Dianxi

1068
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:45,547
You're from outer space

1069
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:47,044
No

1070
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,012
But you look like ET

1071
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,986
Auntie, a small present for you

1072
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,724
Oh, you shouldn't have spent so much

1073
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,554
It's nothing

1074
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:58,289
Thank you

1075
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:02,060
Go get yourself something to eat

1076
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:05,433
Auntie, it's too quiet to have only
a few guests here

1077
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,934
You alone have created so much excitement

1078
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,232
Right

1079
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,903
Madam, a guest is here

1080
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:12,905
You all go and get something to eat first

1081
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:13,601
Okay

1082
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,371
Come... let's eat

1083
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,143
Falong, happy birthday and good health

1084
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:21,876
Thank you

1085
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:24,586
I thought you wouldn't come today

1086
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,485
How come? In fact I remember your birthday

1087
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,457
all the time. But I've never met you again

1088
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,618
Now I've met you again so I am here now

1089
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:33,854
My daughters wanted to throw a big party

1090
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,455
for me today out somewhere

1091
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:38,431
But I don't want a big party this year

1092
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,027
I wished to spend time with some
old friends

1093
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:42,162
I think it's better this way, isn't it?

1094
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:43,705
Your daughters are very sweet

1095
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:47,076
There are two important things
in our lives

1096
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,735
The affection for family and our health

1097
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:50,644
Oh, how's your son?

1098
00:50:50,747 --> 00:50:52,977
He thinks home means hotel

1099
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:54,380
But we can get along anyway

1100
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,418
Come here with him some time

1101
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,919
I don't think I can go to your place

1102
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,450
It's getting late. Aren't you
a bit panicky?

1103
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:03,425
No, I can stay as late as I want

1104
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,492
Let me teach you two a lesson

1105
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,527
Just got this from the office

1106
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,161
You two will know how powerful it is

1107
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:20,669
Soon you will be dead fish

1108
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:24,477
Cousin Song, we're looking for you

1109
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:25,770
Don't you have enough fun?

1110
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:26,814
You are not angry, are you?

1111
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,475
Tuoxian has over done it

1112
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,313
You want me to forget it. Okay

1113
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,511
Have a drink with me then

1114
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,321
Okay, let me drink this and
apologize for him

1115
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:34,146
Okay

1116
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:34,814
Come

1117
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,492
The taste is strange

1118
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,561
Where's Tuoxian?

1119
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,298
I'm going to look for him, okay?

1120
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:47,392
I'm waiting here, hurry up

1121
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,295
Hurry...

1122
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:53,776
Falling... into... my... trap

1123
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:54,741
Come and meet my daughters

1124
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:56,503
Auntie

1125
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,609
This is Song, my nephew

1126
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,408
This is Uncle Guan

1127
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,579
Uncle Guan, you really look like...

1128
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,619
Thank you, let me drink up first

1129
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,149
What're you doing?

1130
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,395
Come here... you all come here

1131
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:22,767
Mother, what's the matter?

1132
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,342
This is my elder daughter Betty

1133
00:52:26,443 --> 00:52:27,933
This is my younger daughter Bobo

1134
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,306
This is Uncle Guan

1135
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,676
We've been good friends for decades

1136
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:33,181
Uncle Guan

1137
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:36,446
Bobo, such a beauty

1138
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,652
He loves to make fun

1139
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:44,420
Falong, if she were our daughter

1140
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:46,155
she would not be a beauty

1141
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:51,029
What are you talking about? You're drunk

1142
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:55,468
Uncle, it seems that you're very drunk

1143
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,935
What is this thing?

1144
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,105
He's not a thing, he's Bobo's boyfriend

1145
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,408
You're a Casanova

1146
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,946
Mother, what's wrong with him?

1147
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,447
He's drunk, let's take him home

1148
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:11,613
What's wrong with him?

1149
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,888
Wait, where are you going?

1150
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,253
I'm going to a party

1151
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,588
I want to go too

1152
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,161
You look familiar

1153
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:20,928
You too

1154
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,065
What's your name?

1155
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:23,962
You tell me first

1156
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,825
My last name is Guan

1157
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,696
Me too

1158
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,333
We're a family, let's be brothers

1159
00:53:33,143 --> 00:53:35,111
Dear big brother

1160
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:35,803
Brother

1161
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,408
Let's dance

1162
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:04,839
It's quite crowded today

1163
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:06,368
Today is a holiday, you know

1164
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:08,307
So we seldom come to our villa

1165
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,675
Mother is preparing some dishes
at the villa

1166
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,475
Your mom is so nice.
This is our first visit

1167
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,810
and we're bothering your mom

1168
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,851
Dianxi, let's invite them to our place
next time

1169
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,112
I'll make some good food for them

1170
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,380
My mom is rarely so generous

1171
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:19,785
She really likes you two

1172
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:20,617
Thank you

1173
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,659
You all can level up after having
that sumptuous feast

1174
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:26,588
I hope uncle is not busy at that time

1175
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:29,397
He's always busy doing nothing

1176
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:30,523
We're going to their place for
the first time

1177
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:31,760
We should bring a gift

1178
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,831
Auntie, don't do this

1179
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,963
Oh... I have to buy one too

1180
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,034
Then let's go together

1181
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:38,732
Okay

1182
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:40,042
I am going with you

1183
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,508
Sis, you go home with Dianxi first

1184
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,511
Mom is awaiting us

1185
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,342
That's fine. Auntie, see you later

1186
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,178
Bye

1187
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:53,618
You're amazing

1188
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:57,156
You are still a good cook, great

1189
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:59,484
I often cook at home

1190
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,161
No wonder Shizhu is so fat

1191
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,428
How many people are coming...

1192
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:06,194
do we have enough food?

1193
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,335
Only her boyfriend's mom

1194
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:09,661
His father died already?

1195
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,468
No, his father is busy today

1196
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:14,471
No time for meeting relatives?

1197
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:16,106
He'd better died

1198
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,243
Oh, you've made a mess

1199
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,286
Go get some clothes and change

1200
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,287
Come in

1201
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:38,392
Mother

1202
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,195
Auntie

1203
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:39,996
Mother

1204
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,099
Only you two? Where are the others?

1205
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,633
Mom said she's going to buy you a gift

1206
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,140
Bobo and Tuoxian went with her

1207
00:55:46,743 --> 00:55:49,337
So nice of her. We've everything here
though

1208
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,538
You both go and enjoy yourselves

1209
00:55:50,647 --> 00:55:51,341
Okay, come here

1210
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,442
This house is beautiful, it can be
used for shooting

1211
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,585
All you think about is shootings

1212
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,553
Okay, let's forget that

1213
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,681
Come on, let's go upstairs

1214
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,416
Okay

1215
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,257
Do you want something to eat now?

1216
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,124
No, thanks, auntie

1217
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,355
No, I'm taking him upstairs

1218
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:08,959
Come on, let me show you the study

1219
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:09,394
Okay

1220
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,261
Here we are

1221
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,691
Wait, I have to get something

1222
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:14,292
Okay

1223
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:23,741
Didn't you go to get something?

1224
00:56:23,847 --> 00:56:24,677
Why are you standing here?

1225
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,944
That drunk you had a bash with
the other day is here

1226
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,519
Just saw him coming out from
the guest room in pajamas

1227
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,621
I don't know what he is doing here?

1228
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:35,514
Come

1229
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:56,973
Hey, come on out

1230
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,280
There! Piece of cake

1231
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:09,290
Oh, he's my dad

1232
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:10,620
Are you okay?

1233
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:11,857
How come you're here?

1234
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:13,655
Why am I here?

1235
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,923
Could you see if I am bleeding?

1236
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,896
This drunkard, oh no...

1237
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,024
Oh, so he's your dad!

1238
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,734
Uncle, I'm sorry, it's a mistake

1239
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,731
She looks familiar

1240
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:27,071
Right, at mother's birthday party

1241
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:29,168
You were drunk and you even danced
with Dianxi

1242
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:30,707
Dianxi

1243
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:31,746
Danced with my dad!

1244
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,078
She's your rich girlfriend?

1245
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:34,878
Yes

1246
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:39,782
Oh dear, what kind of karma it is!

1247
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:42,551
Uncle, what's wrong?

1248
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,025
Your mom and I...

1249
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:46,925
Forget it

1250
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:48,691
Now you two

1251
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:50,823
Dad

1252
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,726
Did you and her mom...

1253
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:55,168
She is not my sister, is she?

1254
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,372
Reckon you've watched too much TV...
stupid

1255
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:58,702
This is not a drama series

1256
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,473
That's better

1257
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:02,436
This is really scary

1258
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:03,978
It's a long story

1259
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,172
Your mom and I were highschool sweethearts

1260
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,183
Thought we were going to get married

1261
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:12,049
But your fat mom snatched me away

1262
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,350
Of course your mom was very upset

1263
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,856
And they became enemies since then

1264
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,017
Now you two are falling in love

1265
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,388
They won't give you their blessings

1266
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,190
Uncle, it doesn't matter

1267
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:21,957
It's the eighties now

1268
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:24,761
We are free to marry the person we love

1269
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,733
I used to say the same in 1950s

1270
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,996
But it was no use

1271
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,504
Are you here with your mom?

1272
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:31,335
Yeah

1273
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:33,474
Hey, where are you guys?

1274
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,505
Shit, your mom is here

1275
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,041
Don't let her know I'm his father

1276
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,077
Big brother

1277
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,083
Good brother

1278
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:45,015
What are they doing here?

1279
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:49,384
Mother, they said they've missed
each other

1280
00:58:49,492 --> 00:58:52,256
since last time. Now they meet again

1281
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,624
And they want to take a vow and
be blood brothers

1282
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,059
I can't believe this

1283
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:57,097
Me too

1284
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:00,029
I'll go downstairs with him
to take a fraternal vow

1285
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,328
A bunch of crazies

1286
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:03,427
Your clothes are ready

1287
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,031
Fine, we're going downstairs
to take a vow now

1288
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:07,174
I'll be the witness

1289
00:59:07,277 --> 00:59:08,005
Take a vow...

1290
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:08,873
Wait for me

1291
00:59:08,978 --> 00:59:10,036
Let's go

1292
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:12,640
Nuts

1293
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:13,841
Your mom can't meet her mom

1294
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:14,644
Her mom can't meet your mom

1295
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:15,240
Sure...

1296
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:16,613
Here they are

1297
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,151
Get into the kitchen

1298
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,750
Hey, anybody home?

1299
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:21,949
You are back

1300
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,253
Auntie

1301
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:23,916
Where's mother?

1302
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,460
This is a nice place

1303
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,824
Where's Dianxi?

1304
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,090
Mom

1305
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:29,221
You're here

1306
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:30,662
What took you so long?

1307
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,200
It takes time to pick the right gifts

1308
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:34,099
Dad just called, he's having
stomachache at home

1309
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:35,261
Let's go home

1310
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,099
What a coincidence

1311
00:59:36,205 --> 00:59:37,672
Yeah, let's go

1312
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,634
You just arrived

1313
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:40,731
Stomachache is nothing serious

1314
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,504
I'll tell him what pills he should take

1315
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:43,840
Just mind your own business

1316
00:59:44,147 --> 00:59:45,774
Come and meet mother first

1317
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:47,008
Mother

1318
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:48,174
Let's go... mom

1319
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,548
Let me go to the toilet before we leave

1320
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:53,247
It takes hours before we get home.
Where's the toilet?

1321
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,186
Let me show you

1322
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:56,754
Shit

1323
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,848
Over here...

1324
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,592
What's the matter?

1325
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:00,421
Mother

1326
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,428
Auntie

1327
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,630
Dianxi's mom is here

1328
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:05,564
Where's she now?

1329
01:00:05,668 --> 01:00:06,726
Just went to the toilet

1330
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:09,400
Auntie, a small gift for you

1331
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,400
You're so kind, I have everything here

1332
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,805
Where is Dianxi and that Uncle Guan?

1333
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:16,970
Where do they take their vows?

1334
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,345
That drunk is here too

1335
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,108
Shut up

1336
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,448
Shit... auntie...

1337
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:23,814
Uncle Guan has burnt his face

1338
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,217
So careless

1339
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,345
Let's get him to the hospital

1340
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,117
Mom, go get your car now

1341
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,623
Okay, I'm getting the car

1342
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,091
Don't, let's call an ambulance

1343
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,923
You're such a pain. Just shut up

1344
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:41,035
Be careful

1345
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:51,878
Oh dear, the engine is down

1346
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:53,076
Let me get down and push

1347
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,016
Auntie, are you in a hurry?

1348
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:01,556
Yes

1349
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,091
Get into her mom's car,
she'll take you to the pier

1350
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:03,817
Right

1351
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,257
Your mom goes out again?

1352
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,794
How come I never get to meet her?

1353
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:07,828
Let's go...

1354
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,454
No...

1355
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:11,431
You have to push hard

1356
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,035
Dianxi, wait

1357
01:01:14,604 --> 01:01:15,366
It's okay

1358
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,104
Wait

1359
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,575
It's hurts

1360
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,175
I'm even worse

1361
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,542
Qimen, get into the car

1362
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:26,778
Coming

1363
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:27,941
Get into the car now

1364
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:29,375
Get into the car

1365
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,749
Mother, take auntie to the pier too

1366
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,154
What? She's your mom?

1367
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:37,949
Right, isn't she good?

1368
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,426
She is your mom?

1369
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:40,825
Yeah

1370
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:44,491
Guan Qimen, why are you here?

1371
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:47,267
A world war starts

1372
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,681
Hey, you tell me now

1373
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:02,717
How long have you been here
with that slut?

1374
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,418
Stop calling me a slut

1375
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,782
We have done nothing

1376
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,822
I'll take you to court if you keep
saying this

1377
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,416
Done nothing? He's wearing pajamas here

1378
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:11,891
And you say you've done nothing

1379
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,090
Stop this, our kids are here

1380
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:15,528
I haven't betrayed you anyway

1381
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,466
Mom, I don't care what happened
in the past

1382
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,127
Betty and I are good friends

1383
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,135
We hope you can make peace with each other

1384
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,563
Anyone can be your girlfriend

1385
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:24,833
But she can't

1386
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,933
Nonsense, it's your son who chases
after her

1387
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,511
My daughter can marry anyone but him

1388
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,538
You're raising hell without a reason

1389
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:32,739
I don't know what happened

1390
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,346
You are free to choose your boyfriend

1391
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:38,317
But this is my enemy's son

1392
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,683
I don't want you to see him anymore

1393
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,983
Uncle, auntie, it's like

1394
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,492
you're in a TV soap opera

1395
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,222
We've made a lot of this stuff

1396
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:48,592
and the ending is always unhappy

1397
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:49,926
This is a cliché, stop it

1398
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,668
No. Happy ending is very popular nowadays

1399
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,260
Shut your mouth up

1400
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,196
We're leaving

1401
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:58,396
Stay here for a night, okay?

1402
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,635
What? You stay here with her, I'm leaving

1403
01:03:02,645 --> 01:03:04,044
Auntie, it's raining heavily outside

1404
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:07,048
The car has broken down,
you can't go without it

1405
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,482
Please stay for the night.
Let's have dinner first

1406
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,046
Right...

1407
01:03:11,354 --> 01:03:13,822
Auntie, let's have dinner first

1408
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,886
Yes, let's talk after dinner

1409
01:03:15,992 --> 01:03:16,924
This tastes great

1410
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:17,685
I don't want to eat

1411
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,267
How dare you

1412
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,200
I beat you little devil

1413
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,798
I beat you up so you can't eat

1414
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,968
I beat you little devil

1415
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,806
I beat you up so you can't breathe

1416
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,540
I beat you up Li Falong

1417
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,445
So you'll be a crazy slut

1418
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,607
I beat you up little devil

1419
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,184
I beat you...

1420
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,982
You bastard

1421
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,215
Don't you know how to drive a car?

1422
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:37,198
Mother, I want to talk to you

1423
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,062
Please don't get angry

1424
01:05:40,236 --> 01:05:42,033
I met Dianxi today

1425
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,833
Only today?

1426
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:48,435
Mother, don't be like this

1427
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:50,570
Let me tell you the truth

1428
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,648
Dianxi's mom has terminal illness

1429
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,441
Really?

1430
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,750
What? We can talk inside the house

1431
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:01,322
It's dark and cold outside

1432
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,358
She's ashamed to meet me?

1433
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:07,561
My mom admits she's wrong

1434
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,494
It's dark outside

1435
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,895
It's easier for her to apologize

1436
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,365
Right, mother

1437
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,828
She feels sorry now, so forgive her

1438
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:15,926
Now she's old

1439
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,505
Do you want her to say sorry
in front of you?

1440
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:18,368
Yeah

1441
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,499
You're not hurt, so you don't feel
the pain

1442
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,673
But now you do feel a little pain

1443
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,439
That's why you're so anxious, am I right?

1444
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,609
My mom is here

1445
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,316
Mother, you go out alone

1446
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,352
It'd be embarrassing

1447
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,649
if we all go too

1448
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:35,018
Right, mother

1449
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:35,590
Auntie

1450
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:38,353
Go, mother

1451
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,327
Shizhu

1452
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:44,660
Don't come over here

1453
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:45,929
Shizhu

1454
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:47,593
I don't want you to get infected

1455
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,903
Have you got fleas?

1456
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,902
You come to see me or come to cry?

1457
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,573
I'm going to die soon

1458
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:01,678
How come your voice is different?

1459
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,678
Because I'm seriously ill

1460
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,310
Too serious my voice changes

1461
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:07,816
Illness? What kind of illness?

1462
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:12,987
I have breast cancer

1463
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:17,461
I don't know why I have cancer

1464
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,831
This is too unfortunate

1465
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:24,403
But you have such a big target

1466
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,808
I'm really sorry for what I did to you

1467
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:31,245
I snatched Qimen away from you

1468
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,608
But life with him is tough too

1469
01:07:34,683 --> 01:07:37,550
In fact you two were a perfect couple

1470
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:40,387
Falong, you're intelligent

1471
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,117
and sophisticated. I'm just a fat woman

1472
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:47,855
Sometimes when I look at the mirror

1473
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,225
I really look like a pig

1474
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,324
You don't have to look down on yourself

1475
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,764
Fat people in fact have many blessings

1476
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:01,507
Falong, I know you'll never forgive me

1477
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,669
But Dianxi and Betty are innocent

1478
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:06,880
They are a perfect couple

1479
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,183
I want to give them my blessings,
how about you?

1480
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,044
I should give them my blessings too

1481
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,654
If I don't, I'm not even human

1482
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,184
That's good

1483
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:23,498
Oh, Tuoxian and Bobo...

1484
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,495
Tuoxian and Bobo...

1485
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:30,164
They are innocent too

1486
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,699
Tuoxian is a great guy

1487
01:08:32,808 --> 01:08:34,799
Hard working and well behaved

1488
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,105
He and Bobo are a perfect couple

1489
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:41,075
You should not separate them too

1490
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:43,743
It's up to her, she's a grown up now

1491
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:45,683
When I'm looking at you now

1492
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,517
I stop being stubborn

1493
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:50,683
That's good. I have to go now

1494
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:54,622
Shizhu, we're still sisters

1495
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,254
Now you're dying

1496
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,390
Tell me if you have any last wishes

1497
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:01,335
No, I don't have any

1498
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:02,961
Don't you have any unfulfilled wishes?

1499
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:03,766
They're all fulfilled

1500
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,135
Just tell me your any unfulfilled wish

1501
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:13,081
Okay, after I die...

1502
01:09:13,182 --> 01:09:15,207
please find a good grave and bury me

1503
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:19,515
And let the young ones lead a smooth life

1504
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:22,750
Then I'll rest in peace

1505
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:26,423
No problem, I will do that for you

1506
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,396
I'll find a good grave for you

1507
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,056
You can go in peace

1508
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,399
Now we are a family

1509
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,166
Come to see me if you have time

1510
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,902
Let's meet as often as we can

1511
01:09:44,413 --> 01:09:46,347
You may go in peace

1512
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:52,348
Add water... water

1513
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,417
Stir it now...

1514
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,455
So stupid, let me do it

1515
01:10:02,097 --> 01:10:02,927
You two never cook

1516
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:05,330
such a big dinner even on my birthday

1517
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,368
Say something nice to her when she arrives

1518
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,231
Remember?

1519
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:11,201
She deserves it. If not for her
stomach cancer

1520
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:12,569
I won't take care of her

1521
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:15,371
She used to curse me a lot. Now you see,

1522
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:18,173
she's getting paid for her unkind heart

1523
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:22,376
Mom, she's now coming to apologize

1524
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,712
You should forgive her

1525
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:25,878
And she won't live long

1526
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,250
So please be nice to her

1527
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,118
Though she's rich

1528
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,818
but we have a happy family

1529
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,831
Mom, taste the soup

1530
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,229
Give me that plate. Watch out, it's hot

1531
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:45,569
Stupid, you scalded me

1532
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:46,732
It's all your fault

1533
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:51,208
Coming...

1534
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,340
Hi

1535
01:10:53,449 --> 01:10:55,974
Auntie, come in... take a seat

1536
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,551
Take a seat, make yourself at home

1537
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,513
Please sit down

1538
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:05,384
The meal will be ready soon...

1539
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:05,960
Give it to me

1540
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:06,925
Careful, it's hot

1541
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:09,253
Where's Shizhu?

1542
01:11:09,365 --> 01:11:10,024
She's sleeping

1543
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,330
Not feeling very well

1544
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,827
She seems quite happy recently

1545
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:15,267
Maybe she doesn't want us to
worry about her

1546
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:17,163
So pitiful!

1547
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:19,567
I've brought you two turtles

1548
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,405
It's good for cancer.
Let her have some turtle soup

1549
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,705
Bobo, where are the turtles?

1550
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:25,745
They're here

1551
01:11:25,848 --> 01:11:27,008
Bring them to the kitchen

1552
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,842
Sit down

1553
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:35,521
Shizhu, Falong is here

1554
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,023
How do you feel? Painful?

1555
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:42,023
It's all his fault, he makes me...

1556
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,959
You're not young anymore

1557
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:45,829
This is too much

1558
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,202
Let's have dinner

1559
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,034
Let's have dinner...

1560
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,300
Sit down...

1561
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,908
These are all vegetable dishes

1562
01:11:59,014 --> 01:12:00,709
We usually prepare meat

1563
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,046
But I think this is good for you

1564
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:05,045
You don't have to do this

1565
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,052
It's better to eat something light now

1566
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,289
I've got you some ginseng,
it's good for you

1567
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:12,758
Betty

1568
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:14,791
Auntie, this is for you

1569
01:12:15,297 --> 01:12:16,286
Then I should accept it

1570
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,458
Falong, you're very fortunate

1571
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,502
You have two nice daughters

1572
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,565
Too bad you won't see them getting married

1573
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:27,702
She's afraid she won't see them
getting married

1574
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,804
Right, the two mothers are
getting along now

1575
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:32,938
And we are happy about this

1576
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:36,542
Let's plan their wedding
as soon as possible

1577
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,142
And later it'd be Bobo and I

1578
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:39,943
Who's going to marry you?

1579
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,220
Great, now everything is going fine

1580
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,758
Let's pick an auspicious day for
their wedding

1581
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,254
Don't delay, the sooner the better

1582
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,323
Shizhu, it will bring luck to you

1583
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,356
You're right, stay as long as you can

1584
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:54,936
Since your look hasn't changed yet

1585
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,367
No, this thing is unpredictable

1586
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,602
But you don't have to worry

1587
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,512
I'm well prepared for this now

1588
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,942
Me too. Qimen will help too

1589
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:13,146
This is important, he will help out
for sure

1590
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,554
Enough, you are making me nervous now

1591
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,187
Right, auntie, mom, let's have dinner

1592
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,092
Let's eat...

1593
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:26,923
I've found you a place

1594
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:29,371
What place?

1595
01:13:32,007 --> 01:13:33,372
Auntie, sorry

1596
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,306
So careless, now I get rice all over
my face

1597
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,378
Come on...

1598
01:13:39,782 --> 01:13:40,908
Auntie, let me help you

1599
01:13:41,884 --> 01:13:42,680
Let me tell you the truth

1600
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:43,979
When we're coming here

1601
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,451
She said now she's dying

1602
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:46,521
And she can't take the money with her

1603
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:47,850
So she's going to buy you a house

1604
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:49,624
Really?

1605
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:50,521
Yes

1606
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:54,551
Buy mom a grave?
What's Tuoxian doing here?

1607
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,459
What has Tuoxian to do with this?

1608
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:01,399
He's been there for a while,
wonder what he's doing?

1609
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,602
Okay, let's eat, let's eat

1610
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:08,032
Falong, you are so kind

1611
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:10,703
It's nothing, I can do it

1612
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:12,110
You can have peace of mind

1613
01:14:12,214 --> 01:14:13,806
And I can stop worrying

1614
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,011
The fengshui is good, and it's brand new

1615
01:14:17,753 --> 01:14:21,382
New one? In fact I like old ones

1616
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:23,617
I love the pre-war stuff

1617
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:26,421
It's very spacious you can roll
on the floor

1618
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,223
Old ones stink

1619
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,996
Use some air freshener
and it should be okay

1620
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,168
Auntie, your taste is so strange

1621
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:38,370
Not strange. Oh, does it have
lots of windows?

1622
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,066
I love bright ambiance

1623
01:14:40,809 --> 01:14:41,833
She's getting crazy

1624
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:43,107
Is that so?

1625
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,612
Do you want me to renovate it?

1626
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,410
No, that's fine. Is the transport
convenient?

1627
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:49,381
It's quite far away

1628
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:53,319
But we'll come to see you
in spring and autumn

1629
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:55,654
Only twice a year?

1630
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,648
We are a family

1631
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,820
But probably you might not be
around anymore

1632
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,825
That's true. Probably we'd have

1633
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:04,899
immigrated by then

1634
01:15:06,301 --> 01:15:07,962
Must be crazy, treating
'passing away' as immigration

1635
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:11,000
And yes, is the management fee expensive?

1636
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:12,929
You don't have to worry about this

1637
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,100
I have paid it all for you

1638
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,302
You don't have to pay anymore

1639
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:19,806
Falong, you're so nice to me

1640
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:22,315
I blamed you wrongly, please forgive me

1641
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:24,317
Shizhu, don't get too emotional

1642
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:26,950
Did I hurt you?

1643
01:15:27,823 --> 01:15:28,687
It's the table corner

1644
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:31,522
When shall we go and have a look?

1645
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,721
Any time you want

1646
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:34,853
The hole is already there

1647
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:37,563
The hole? It's not built yet?

1648
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,732
Don't have to build anything,
you just lay down in it

1649
01:15:40,836 --> 01:15:43,396
The Fengshui master said it's a
good piece of land

1650
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,405
Your remains can be picked 3 years later

1651
01:15:46,041 --> 01:15:47,599
Bullshit, you pick your own remains

1652
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,204
Your cancer must make you crazy

1653
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,078
Bullshit, your cancer has made you crazy

1654
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,042
I am being so nice and have found you
a good grave

1655
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:55,878
and you are cursing me

1656
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,384
Buy me a grave, you're so vicious!

1657
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,949
Qimen, throw them all out

1658
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:11,825
Thank you...

1659
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:13,395
I'm getting rich

1660
01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:14,298
Is it on fire?

1661
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:16,501
You're crazy

1662
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:18,766
You're crazy, I just had a dream

1663
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,273
Guanyin asked me to buy a
Mark Six lottery ticket

1664
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:23,367
Said I would win the first prize.
The numbers are

1665
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,206
23, 26...

1666
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:25,678
Did Guanyin tell you to get more sleep

1667
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:27,339
So you can talk to her in your dream?

1668
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:29,380
You drive me crazy

1669
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,849
What are the six numbers she told you?

1670
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:38,826
23, 26, 30, 32, 35, 41

1671
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,425
I'll get it for you tomorrow morning

1672
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:47,330
Hello, this is the 1997th
Mark Six lottery draw

1673
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:49,165
All the six numbers and the extra number

1674
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:50,636
are drawn already

1675
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:52,468
Now let me repeat them once

1676
01:16:52,574 --> 01:16:54,735
The six drawn numbers and
the extra number are:

1677
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,573
Okay, done. Uncle Dong, thank you.

1678
01:17:02,517 --> 01:17:03,245
Thank you so much, Uncle Dong

1679
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:05,446
Hey... Tuoxian

1680
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,112
Why do you want me to do this?

1681
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,850
Don't tell anyone about this

1682
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,523
I've bought a Mark Six ticket

1683
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,790
for my future mother-in-law

1684
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:18,866
Tomorrow is her birthday, I want her
to be happy

1685
01:17:18,967 --> 01:17:19,865
So I'm just kidding around with her

1686
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,838
Mom, time for the Mark Six draw

1687
01:17:26,341 --> 01:17:27,000
Coming...

1688
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:28,505
Hurry up

1689
01:17:34,549 --> 01:17:37,484
The 1st prize of the 1997th draw
is a big one

1690
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:40,282
Now everyone must be very anxious

1691
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:43,183
to find out which six numbers are drawn

1692
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:46,956
Okay, the first number is coming

1693
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:48,258
Please pay attention

1694
01:17:48,964 --> 01:17:51,660
The first number today is

1695
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,103
23 has been quite favored recently

1696
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:57,296
Many people have it

1697
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:59,331
Now is the second number

1698
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,771
The second number is

1699
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,902
30, it's a large number

1700
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,809
Large numbers are popular, isn't it?

1701
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,541
Now let's look at the third number

1702
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,947
It's still a large number, 35

1703
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,213
Large numbers really seem to be hot

1704
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:14,784
Now it's the fourth number

1705
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,188
What will the fourth number be?

1706
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,021
Please pay attention

1707
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,294
What is the fourth number?

1708
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:22,658
32...

1709
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:25,930
Now it's the fifth number

1710
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:26,796
The fifth number now

1711
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,199
41...

1712
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:29,736
The fifth number is

1713
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:32,437
Large numbers really seem to be hot

1714
01:18:32,574 --> 01:18:34,804
Okay, here goes the last number

1715
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:35,899
26...

1716
01:18:36,011 --> 01:18:37,205
The sixth number is...

1717
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:39,041
26...

1718
01:18:39,147 --> 01:18:41,638
Now the sixth number is

1719
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,147
Number 26

1720
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,656
I win

1721
01:18:49,591 --> 01:18:51,889
We've won Mark Six

1722
01:18:51,993 --> 01:18:52,755
We're rich now

1723
01:18:52,861 --> 01:18:55,659
Mom, let go...

1724
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:56,389
I've won

1725
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:57,487
I'm going to die

1726
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,499
I'm very happy

1727
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,660
Mom, you've broken the table

1728
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:04,238
Doesn't matter, get a new one

1729
01:19:04,339 --> 01:19:07,137
Mom, dad is out of breath

1730
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,733
Doesn't matter, I'll have a new one

1731
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:14,276
Let's throw all the furniture away

1732
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,809
I want to buy a new house

1733
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,818
Any gasoline? Let me burn this house

1734
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:19,852
Mom...

1735
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:23,584
Let go of me...

1736
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:28,290
Please take a look

1737
01:19:31,032 --> 01:19:31,930
Do you like this one?

1738
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,129
It's pretty, mother, choose what you like

1739
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,401
Take this one

1740
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,278
Let's go to another shop

1741
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,349
I like buying here. If others can
come here

1742
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,215
Why can't I?

1743
01:19:53,588 --> 01:19:55,112
Bring out the most expensive gold chains

1744
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:56,053
for me to have a look

1745
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:56,715
They're very expensive

1746
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:00,487
It takes a long time to spend
the $20 million prize

1747
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:01,796
So I have to spend it this way

1748
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,829
Auntie, when will you buy a new house?

1749
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:07,563
Shut up

1750
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,296
Let's go to other shop. They're jealous

1751
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,372
Hey...

1752
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,023
Let's go

1753
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:38,026
Shizhu... what are you doing? Shizhu

1754
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:38,792
What happened?

1755
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:40,459
Shizhu is kidnapped

1756
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:41,968
What? Auntie is kidnapped

1757
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:45,938
I think we should go to the police

1758
01:20:46,041 --> 01:20:47,474
You worry those kidnappers would kill her

1759
01:20:48,243 --> 01:20:50,768
Falong, they only ask for
a $500,000 ransom

1760
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,176
Please give me the money first

1761
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,542
I'll give it back to you later,
with interest

1762
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,311
It's all mom's fault

1763
01:20:57,419 --> 01:20:59,683
She tells everyone about winning big money

1764
01:21:01,489 --> 01:21:05,585
I'm not surprised. She's out of her head

1765
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:07,989
And she just can't keep her mouth shut

1766
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:13,761
Mother, please help them

1767
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,668
Falong, I know you hate Shizhu

1768
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,241
She's cheap, she's no good

1769
01:21:21,343 --> 01:21:22,970
But she's my wife too

1770
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,973
How can I ignore her?

1771
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,110
Please help her, I beg you

1772
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:28,512
We're not young anymore

1773
01:21:28,617 --> 01:21:30,676
If something happened to her

1774
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:34,118
I would be lonely for the rest of my life

1775
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:35,888
Do you want me to cook my own dinner?

1776
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:38,960
Mother, please help Uncle Guan

1777
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:40,487
It's none of your business

1778
01:21:40,629 --> 01:21:42,529
"Studio. No trespassing"

1779
01:21:50,805 --> 01:21:51,999
Falong, be careful

1780
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,375
Auntie, let me go with you

1781
01:21:54,476 --> 01:21:54,942
No

1782
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:55,873
The kidnappers want her to go alone

1783
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:56,909
You shouldn't go together

1784
01:21:57,012 --> 01:21:58,809
Okay, I can handle this, I'm fine

1785
01:22:00,615 --> 01:22:02,242
Auntie, please be careful

1786
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:06,648
Hurry up...

1787
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:16,422
Shizhu...

1788
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:18,631
Where are you?

1789
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:21,362
Shizhu...

1790
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,333
It's me, Shizhu

1791
01:22:32,514 --> 01:22:33,742
Shizhu

1792
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,753
How come you've fallen asleep? Wake up

1793
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,291
Falong, untie me, hurry

1794
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:49,454
You haven't paid the ransom yet

1795
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,425
I've brought the money here

1796
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:00,331
You should let her go now

1797
01:23:01,242 --> 01:23:04,405
I'm not stupid. You'll go to the police

1798
01:23:11,586 --> 01:23:13,019
Stop pulling, it's no use

1799
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:14,213
Only waste your energy

1800
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,313
But I have to give it a try

1801
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:17,686
We can't just wait here forever

1802
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,318
I'm trapped here

1803
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:21,588
all because of you

1804
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:23,894
I want to die with company

1805
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:24,795
I like to move

1806
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:25,627
Stop it

1807
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:28,328
I don't want to listen to you

1808
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:29,061
I like to move

1809
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:32,439
Stop it

1810
01:23:32,540 --> 01:23:33,837
I like to move

1811
01:23:48,289 --> 01:23:49,187
I'm scared

1812
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:29,192
It scared me

1813
01:24:29,297 --> 01:24:30,787
I don't know how to swim

1814
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,963
It's you who wants to move. Go ahead

1815
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,892
Why don't you move? Let's die together

1816
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:35,970
Isn't it a good idea?

1817
01:24:36,337 --> 01:24:39,101
I'm sorry. This is not intentional

1818
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:42,301
I just meant to scare you, but...

1819
01:24:45,146 --> 01:24:46,841
Shizhu, are you alright?

1820
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,974
Falong, I'm scared

1821
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:51,644
I'm scared to death. I want your place

1822
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,687
You think we're in a revolving cafe?

1823
01:24:54,222 --> 01:24:56,918
Falong, this time it seems I've
involved you

1824
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:59,186
You can punch me...

1825
01:24:59,561 --> 01:25:03,657
We've been hating each other for decades

1826
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,632
Now we're going to die, let's make peace

1827
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,567
Falong, we're fighting because
of a stupid man

1828
01:25:09,671 --> 01:25:11,002
Now I realize it's not worth it

1829
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,700
He doesn't even come to our rescue now

1830
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,400
I'll make him pay even after I die

1831
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:17,569
Right, let's strangle him to death

1832
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:23,111
They're not here

1833
01:25:23,485 --> 01:25:23,974
Where could they be?

1834
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:24,710
How come?

1835
01:25:25,186 --> 01:25:26,016
Take a look over there

1836
01:25:28,723 --> 01:25:29,451
Look

1837
01:25:30,525 --> 01:25:31,719
Where's the wheel going?

1838
01:25:31,826 --> 01:25:32,724
What should we do now?

1839
01:25:32,827 --> 01:25:34,055
Let's split and search, okay?

1840
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:34,856
Okay...

1841
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:35,793
Let's go that way

1842
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:36,864
Hurry...

1843
01:25:47,308 --> 01:25:48,832
Help...

1844
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,810
Shizhu

1845
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:54,075
Falong, are you okay?

1846
01:25:54,182 --> 01:25:54,773
Where's Shizhu?

1847
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:55,713
In the front

1848
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:00,282
Shizhu

1849
01:26:00,855 --> 01:26:02,846
Shizhu, it's all my fault

1850
01:26:02,957 --> 01:26:04,117
I've put you into such a horrible
situation

1851
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:05,487
Shizhu, let's ignore him

1852
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,919
You scoundrel plan all this to trap us

1853
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,462
Now cut the crap

1854
01:26:09,564 --> 01:26:10,861
Save Falong now

1855
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:14,867
Falong, don't blame me

1856
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:16,027
It's for the good of you two

1857
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,263
No need to explain

1858
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,512
Don't be afraid, I'm coming to
your help now

1859
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,337
Qimen, are you alright?

1860
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:56,771
I'm a sinner, the heaven is punishing me

1861
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,277
I have to pay for what I did

1862
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:01,143
Qimen, after I die...

1863
01:27:01,249 --> 01:27:03,080
Nobody will wash your underwear

1864
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,242
Don't worry about him

1865
01:27:04,352 --> 01:27:05,410
He can wear disposable ones

1866
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,612
Just throw them away after wearing

1867
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,789
Qimen, please find some help

1868
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:13,189
There's nobody around, just a snake

1869
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:19,122
Help...

1870
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,565
Shizhu, what happened?

1871
01:27:21,002 --> 01:27:23,095
Don't move so violently

1872
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,568
I'm going to collapse

1873
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,140
Shizhu, what are you doing?

1874
01:27:37,051 --> 01:27:37,779
Well, did you find them?

1875
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:38,681
No

1876
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:39,275
What should we do?

1877
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:39,978
Take a look over there

1878
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,077
Okay

1879
01:27:45,059 --> 01:27:46,788
Ignore him

1880
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:47,786
Okay

1881
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:54,260
Mother

1882
01:27:55,103 --> 01:27:57,469
I'm scared

1883
01:27:57,572 --> 01:27:58,596
Yes...

1884
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:01,641
Help...

1885
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:03,677
Don't be scared

1886
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:05,001
I'm here holding the wheel

1887
01:28:08,549 --> 01:28:10,779
Qimen

1888
01:28:10,885 --> 01:28:13,285
Before you die, tell me the truth

1889
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,322
Which one of us do you really love?

1890
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:16,720
Right, tell us

1891
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:19,826
I...

1892
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:20,859
Tell us

1893
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:22,752
We're all dying now

1894
01:28:22,864 --> 01:28:23,888
Why don't you just tell the truth?

1895
01:28:23,998 --> 01:28:25,761
Right, tell us now

1896
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:26,794
Tell us

1897
01:28:26,901 --> 01:28:28,061
I love both of you

1898
01:28:29,103 --> 01:28:31,594
No, you have to choose one only

1899
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:32,263
Yes

1900
01:28:32,373 --> 01:28:34,068
Okay, I choose Falong, she's so gentle

1901
01:28:35,977 --> 01:28:37,171
You go to hell

1902
01:28:45,653 --> 01:28:49,316
Shizhu, I can't live without you

1903
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:50,948
I want to go with you together

1904
01:28:51,459 --> 01:28:54,519
Don't stop me...

1905
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,256
If you die then I have no one to scold

1906
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:00,996
Dear, you're still alive

1907
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:06,171
Falong, are you alright?

1908
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,539
I'm okay. It's because you held the wheel

1909
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:10,103
Or else it'd have been awful!

1910
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:13,505
Great, we have a happy ending

1911
01:29:15,383 --> 01:29:16,350
Auntie, our apologies

1912
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,248
For having such a shitty scheme

1913
01:29:19,087 --> 01:29:20,019
If you have done this

1914
01:29:20,121 --> 01:29:21,383
Your mom and I won't let you

1915
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:22,854
marry Dianxi

1916
01:29:23,324 --> 01:29:24,120
Is that true?

1917
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,920
Really? Mom

1918
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:26,755
Thank you

1919
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:29,463
Oh right, just a while back you did
choose Falong

1920
01:29:29,564 --> 01:29:31,031
Then why were you so anxious
when I was about to die?

1921
01:29:31,532 --> 01:29:32,624
I just wanted to make you a bit mad

1922
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:35,568
Shizhu, I have been keeping this
in my heart

1923
01:29:35,670 --> 01:29:37,535
for 12 years. I've never told you this

1924
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:38,332
What?

1925
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,530
I LOVE U

1926
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,004
Really?

1927
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:45,269
When I tell the truth, you laugh at me

1928
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,512
I should eat dog shit if I lie to you

1929
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:55,018
The wind is blowing the leaves

1930
01:29:56,424 --> 01:30:01,259
It knows who I'm thinking of day and night

1931
01:30:03,831 --> 01:30:10,100
My heart, full of love, is broken quietly

1932
01:30:10,204 --> 01:30:14,231
Leaving the forbidden zone of love

1933
01:30:16,244 --> 01:30:20,772
My heart wanders into a hopeless slumber

1934
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:26,953
Coz I don't want to think about you
all the time

1935
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:33,554
I admit to be a bit weary of
our changing relationship

1936
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:40,928
But nobody can replace you

1937
01:30:41,702 --> 01:30:47,732
I don't believe that true love is a sin

1938
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:53,303
But now I meet my true love and
become a sinner

1939
01:30:54,415 --> 01:31:01,218
Your voice and your eyes are in my dreams

1940
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:03,689
And I cannot forget them...

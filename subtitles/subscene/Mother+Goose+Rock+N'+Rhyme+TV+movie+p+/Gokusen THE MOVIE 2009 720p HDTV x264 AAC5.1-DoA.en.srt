00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,650
"Narita International Airport"

2
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,710
On its way from Hong Kong to Tokyo,

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,910
First Airline flight 816

4
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,220
was hijacked before landing in Narita Airport.

5
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,900
No demand except for a ramp
has been made by the hijackers...

6
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,860
They may be armed with guns.

7
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,760
The passengers' safety is of the greatest concern.

8
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,160
What's their demand?

9
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,270
20 million dollars and a getaway plane.

10
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,700
We won't accept.

11
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,140
Should we send in the SWAT team?

12
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,680
Not yet. We'll use them as our last resort.

13
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,650
They're taking too long.

14
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,220
We'll wait 5 more minutes.

15
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,460
Stop screwing with us!

16
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,760
Our vacation abroad...

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,300
It was a bad idea.

18
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,040
At any rate...

19
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,970
How can she stay asleep?

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,120
I slept so well.

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,950
Are we landing soon?

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,490
Keep your voice down.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,330
Quiet!

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,730
Yes.

25
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,170
Hijack?

26
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,340
When did this happen?

27
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,670
Can I have some water?

28
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,650
Shut your mouth, hag!

29
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,450
Hag?

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,480
What's that look?

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,220
Sit still and behave, geezer.

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,390
Unforgivable.

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,760
You all behave.

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,200
Miss Yamaguchi!

35
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,640
They're people who deserve respect

36
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,800
for their decades of hard work.

37
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,000
How dare you dis them.

38
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,970
What'd you say?

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,980
Whatever it is you want,

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,320
face the sun and

41
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,920
say it with pride and dignity.

42
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,390
Stop blabbering!

43
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,330
Move in!

44
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,030
There was a gunshot.

45
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,240
The hijackers did have guns.

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,250
Forgive us!

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,960
Huh?

48
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,130
Miss Yamaguchi?

49
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,410
- What?
- Look!

50
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,700
You're kidding!

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,620
Miss Yamaguchi?!

52
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,940
Yankumi...

53
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,680
My Lady...

54
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,050
Kumiko...

55
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,060
My Lady's in trouble!

56
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,160
You guys, let's go!

57
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,000
We're going.

58
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,670
It's over.

59
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,550
No... I'm not the criminal.

60
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,980
I'm straight.

61
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,420
Straight?

62
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,390
Straight?

63
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:04,430
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi.

64
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,690
A teacher at Akado High School.

65
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,770
I teach math.

66
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,460
My nickname is Yankumi.

67
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,160
By the way, I'm single.

68
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,740
GOKUSEN THE MOVIE

69
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,250
"The Oedo Family"

70
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,380
I'm glad you're okay.

71
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,890
It was reckless of you.

72
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,920
I'm sorry to worry you.

73
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,590
But we were impressed.

74
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,730
Guts and honor befitting
the 4th generation head.

75
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,440
You can take over any day.

76
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,240
My Lady!
No..."Lady Boss"!

77
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,840
Sounds nice.

78
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:36,410
You guys, follow my lead.

79
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,120
"The Oedo Family"

80
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,460
No way. I'm not taking over.

81
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,970
I bought souvenirs for you.

82
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,770
You didn't have to do that.

83
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,240
Oops... They're at the airport.

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,460
Sorry.

85
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,340
I'm Kumiko Yamaguchi,
a high school teacher.

86
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,010
I lost my parents at age 7

87
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,940
and was raised by my grandfather,
Ryuichiro Kuroda,

88
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,780
the 3rd generation head of the Oedo Family.

89
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,180
I've been a teacher for 7 years.

90
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,990
My students always happen
to be so-called delinquents.

91
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,820
But they taught me things.

92
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,660
Face them squarely and they'll do the same.

93
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,300
You can see eye to eye.

94
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,740
In 7 years, I've grown thanks to my students.

95
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,910
Good morning, Yankumi.

96
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,650
Good morning, Kuma.

97
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,790
I saw you on the news yesterday.

98
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,890
No big deal. I wasn't afraid of them.

99
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,250
You were cool.

100
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,020
No compliments.

101
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,060
It's embarrassing.

102
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,430
See ya.

103
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,880
"Hijackers surrender themselves"

104
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,640
"Hijackers arrested"

105
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,720
I didn't know this was your flight.

106
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,190
I was shocked when I saw the news.

107
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,550
Thank goodness you're safe.

108
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,600
It was terrifying.
Miss Ayukawa is still in shock.

109
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm gonna die...

110
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,060
A hijack...

111
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,930
Help me.

112
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,300
So why did the hijackers surrender themselves?

113
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,840
Well, Miss Yamaguchi...

114
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,070
They knew they couldn't get away.

115
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,710
Miss Yamaguchi.

116
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,720
Good morning, Vice Principal.

117
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,950
Principal.

118
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,150
Oh... sorry.

119
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,380
May I?

120
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,960
"Passenger scolds hijackers?"

121
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,430
Was it you?

122
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,660
No.

123
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,100
Good.

124
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,500
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

125
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,780
Don't forget.
I've told you many times.

126
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,610
We'll both be fired.

127
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,820
Don't attract attention to yourself.

128
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,790
A trainee teacher starts today, right?

129
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,420
He's not here yet.

130
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,020
Late from day one.

131
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,490
He needs to be disciplined.

132
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,990
I'm sorry I'm late.

133
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,100
I apologize.

134
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,270
Odagiri!

135
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,970
Yankumi...

136
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,610
Odagiri!

137
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,740
Baba...

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,210
You're...

139
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,850
That Odagiri?

140
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,650
Vice Principal Monkey Brain.

141
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,980
Principal Sawatari.

142
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,020
Seriously?

143
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,690
You know him, Miss Yamaguchi?

144
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,560
He was my student at Kurogin.

145
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:49,010
I'm Ryu Odagiri, the trainee teacher.
Nice to meet you.

146
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,640
Let's go.

147
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,470
Good luck.

148
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,250
Welcome.

149
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,280
Give him proper guidance.

150
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,780
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,630
It's been a while.

152
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,790
You were such a handful back then.

153
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,770
But look at you now.

154
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,800
This was my dream.

155
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,140
A student admiring me

156
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,520
choosing to become a teacher.

157
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,150
What?

158
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,860
So, Odagiri...

159
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,930
You and me and the students united
with passion and sweat!

160
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,970
Follow my lead.

161
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,500
You're even more gung-ho.

162
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,240
You don't want to be a teacher?

163
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:03,710
I don't know yet.
I just took the teacher-training course.

164
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,280
You're not here because I'm here?

165
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,450
Of course not.

166
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,990
Oh...

167
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,120
How're you doing with
your new troublemakers?

168
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
Not that well.

169
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,900
I'm taking it slowly.

170
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:31,440
Teachers have to be patient
with their students.

171
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,480
Join me.

172
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,510
You still do that?

173
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,310
Yes.

174
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,480
Good morning.

175
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,600
Quiet, please.

176
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
Quiet down.

177
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:03,140
Quiet, please.

178
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,850
I told you to be quiet!

179
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,020
"Teachers have to be patient," right?

180
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,990
What're you babbling about?

181
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
You can't boss us around!

182
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,450
Who put out a cigarette here?

183
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,210
So that's why.

184
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,750
She was just lucky.

185
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,250
You have to use an ashtray.

186
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,290
That's not the point.

187
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,260
Who was smoking?!

188
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,630
- I dunno

189
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
- We wouldn't tell you anyway.

190
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,940
We don't sell out our friends.

191
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,270
We take good care of each other.

192
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,640
What's funny?

193
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,150
Nothing.

194
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,350
Smoking by minors is verboten.

195
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,850
Verboten?

196
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,550
What's that word?

197
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:30,720
Not being caught doesn't make things okay.

198
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,200
The sun's watching you.

199
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,790
The sun?

200
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,400
What does that mean?

201
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,010
Let me introduce him.

202
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,780
Mr. Ryu Odagiri, a trainee teacher.

203
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,250
To get acquainted with Mr. Odagiri,

204
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,080
let's play Kick the Can.

205
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,350
Change into your jerseys
and come to the field.

206
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,100
At least we can get acquainted.

207
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,210
No thanks.

208
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,420
Dammit!

209
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,950
Uh-oh. Run!

210
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,960
Whoa...

211
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,630
That trainee teacher was
Yamaguchi's student.

212
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,530
A delinquent at Kurogin.

213
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,100
A delinquent-turned-teacher?

214
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,570
No way.

215
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,610
Big news!

216
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,350
Unbelievable!

217
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,620
What's going on?!

218
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,020
Listen to this!

219
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,630
What's up?

220
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,390
Why are you so amped up?

221
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:18,970
You see!

222
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,600
You see!

223
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,700
Stop talking at once.

224
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,850
Yankumi was walking with a guy.

225
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,450
- You guys saw them too?

226
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,490
- Yeah.

227
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,090
He was even good-looking.

228
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,350
- No way.

229
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,580
- Probably an illusion.

230
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:40,920
- It was really her!

231
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,120
- It'll snow tomorrow!

232
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,790
Table for two, please.

233
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,890
Sit. I recommend...

234
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,230
I know.

235
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,970
Guys! Long time no see.

236
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,270
How're you doing?

237
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,700
Why are you gaping at me?

238
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,210
Odagiri, it's you!

239
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,480
Hello.

240
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,710
Ryu Odagiri, Yankumi's student
from Kurogin High.

241
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,050
Student?!

242
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,980
Now I understand.

243
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,790
So that's why...

244
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,260
They were worked up
because they saw you with a guy.

245
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,700
They thought it was an illusion.

246
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,970
Yankumi could never find
a good-looking boyfriend.

247
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,630
Never.

248
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,100
We were such idiots.

249
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,640
Totally.

250
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,710
I told you "no way."

251
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,150
No way?

252
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,050
You guys, outside!
Right now!

253
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,120
What do you mean...

254
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,490
Calm down.
Two ramen noodles, please.

255
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,790
"Kumai Noodle Shop"

256
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,900
Yummy!

257
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,270
I'm impressed.

258
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,170
You're going to school regularly.

259
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,900
We try.

260
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,310
You've matured since high school.

261
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,710
How's work going for you guys?

262
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,080
Just great.

263
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,740
Kura's always getting in trouble.

264
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,720
Don't tell.

265
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,160
I get in trouble with my dad at our tofu shop.

266
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,660
Work is tough, no matter what it is.

267
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,030
I wish they'd pay me more.

268
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,190
Yeah. That's why I'm getting a night job.

269
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,340
A night job?

270
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,840
You idiot! A delivery job.

271
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,280
Oh.

272
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:48,510
I thought the shady type.

273
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,110
Of course not.

274
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,920
What shady type?

275
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:58,220
You still having a hard time with your class?

276
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,560
Sort of.

277
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,290
We rejected her at first too.

278
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,130
Yeah, her lectures were awful.

279
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,210
So annoying at first.

280
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,270
We bet on when she'd quit.

281
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,810
We did too.

282
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,450
Really? How about you?

283
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,380
Probably.

284
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,220
Everyone's the same.

285
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,580
Yep.

286
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,400
Are you crying?

287
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,960
No, you idiot.

288
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,900
I'm happy.

289
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,870
My students from
different schools are here...

290
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,880
Laughing together...

291
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,050
Real happy.

292
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm glad I became a teacher.

293
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,070
Wipe them.

294
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,770
Eat as much as you want.

295
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,510
Order anything. It's my treat.

296
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,580
Roasted pork noodles!

297
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,250
Dumplings, large portion!

298
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,380
Sounds good.

299
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,320
Large fried rice!

300
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,260
Kuma, bring them all.

301
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,590
It's before payday, isn't it?

302
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:47,200
No large portions. No roasted pork.

303
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,600
Cancel the dumplings.

304
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,340
Just more noodles, okay?

305
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,510
More noodles for six.

306
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,580
No way!

307
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,390
Reita's late.

308
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,890
He'll be here soon.

309
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:12,420
Yo, can I borrow some money?

310
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,730
Don't have any.

311
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,100
Shut up and hand it over.

312
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,570
Reita!

313
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,140
Keep your hands off my friends.

314
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,880
Who are you?!

315
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,580
Reita Takasugi of Akado.
Got a problem?

316
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,700
It was my dream to drink
with a student of mine.

317
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,700
Don't be shy, brother.

318
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,060
Brother?

319
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,110
He means "friend."

320
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,470
Wonderful, isn't it?

321
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,770
A student, now a responsible adult.

322
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,740
It means you taught him well.

323
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,780
That's not true.

324
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,650
I know.

325
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,060
What'd you say?

326
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,430
Tetsu, sit.

327
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:19,960
Certainly.

328
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,670
Scary.

329
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,700
You had the brains, Odagiri.

330
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,310
- Minoru.
- Sorry.

331
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,500
Be prepared.

332
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,040
Drink 'til you drop.

333
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,080
That's My Lady.

334
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,990
"Be prepared" huh...

335
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,600
She must've been so happy.

336
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,970
Her student finding his own path.

337
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,850
I haven't found mine yet.

338
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,750
Gonna be a teacher, right?

339
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,420
No...

340
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,170
I thought I could

341
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,900
find my path in college but I couldn't.

342
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,040
So I started to panic.

343
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,380
Then I remembered what she said.

344
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,280
"Don't give up."

345
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,420
"It's okay to fail."

346
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,400
She was sort of annoying
but taught me many things.

347
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,720
She puts her heart and soul into everything.

348
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,520
I want to find my own path like her.

349
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,050
My head hurts.

350
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,540
I'm gonna throw up.

351
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,590
- Excuse me.
- Me too.

352
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,020
Yankumi!

353
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,960
Takeda! Hyuga!

354
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,970
Long time no see.

355
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,660
How're you doing?

356
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,710
You two working hard?

357
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,110
Of course. Dumb question.

358
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,440
Look at me, a businessman.

359
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:27,880
What are you doing here?

360
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,220
Listening to his speech.

361
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,620
Thank you for your time.

362
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:39,090
I've decided to run for
a seat in the Lower House.

363
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,520
My name is Kentaro Kurose.

364
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,640
Who is he?

365
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:50,710
You don't know? The president of
Dream Associates, an IT giant.

366
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,480
He's amazing.

367
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,480
A former delinquent like us
who succeeded in business.

368
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,310
Now he'll be in the election.

369
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,250
Impressive.

370
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,360
Yeah, he is.

371
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,720
Today I'm a success in the IT industry

372
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,460
but I used to be a troublemaker.

373
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:21,260
I was reformed thanks to
many people's support.

374
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,840
I want to repay this society for accepting me.

375
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,850
Wonderful.

376
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,420
Wonderful.

377
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,090
You have my support.

378
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,200
Thank you.

379
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,760
You look like my old flame.

380
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,570
I bet you are kind and earnest

381
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,550
and honest like him.

382
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,750
Good luck.

383
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,750
Let's go.

384
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,080
You're troubling him.

385
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,260
I'm rooting for you.

386
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,400
My name's Yamaguchi.

387
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,730
I'm rooting for you.

388
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,770
"Akado High School"

389
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,600
Those guys yesterday pissed me off.

390
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,650
Whoever they were, Reita showed them.

391
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,780
They talked big but they were pussies.

392
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,610
You're awesome, Reita.

393
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,810
Not really.

394
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,490
- Another fight?
- Is that a problem?

395
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,360
Don't pop out of nowhere!

396
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,060
Fighting isn't necessarily bad but...

397
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,790
Then leave us alone.

398
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:22,990
Reita Takasugi, come out here!

399
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,970
I heard you and my buddies
got friendly yesterday.

400
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,860
The guys from yesterday...

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,100
They're the Black Skull.

402
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,470
Black Skull?

403
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,840
A bad motorcycle gang.

404
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,290
A motorcycle gang is outside.
Please hurry!

405
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,660
Let's go.

406
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,430
We're not done with you!

407
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,710
Why on earth did you get involved
with that sort?!

408
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,410
Principal, they seem to be
a very violent group.

409
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,710
Extortions, assaults...
Many run-ins with the police.

410
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,280
Scary.

411
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,490
A fight with guys like that of all people...

412
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:28,680
It wasn't a fight.

413
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,190
Reita stopped them from
extorting money from us.

414
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,530
You're saying it wasn't some foolish reason?

415
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,030
If you don't believe us, then forget it.

416
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,400
We can't forget it.

417
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:50,810
Is it true what you told us?

418
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,410
Yeah.

419
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,170
- Vice Principal.
- Principal.

420
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,210
They're not lying.

421
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,400
You believe them?

422
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,940
I do.

423
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,480
If they're lying,
I'll see it in their eyes.

424
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,790
Are you sure?

425
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,790
I'll hold you responsible.

426
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,960
The next time your students cause trouble,

427
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,160
you're fired.

428
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,340
Fine.

429
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,710
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

430
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,550
- See it in our eyes?!
- She's trying to act tough.

431
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,220
She doesn't mean it.

432
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,960
Teachers are all the same.

433
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,130
You okay, Reita?

434
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,290
They're real bad asses.

435
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,870
Been arrested a lot.

436
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,070
Serious?

437
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,570
They'll be back.

438
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,410
We'll be in deep shit.

439
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,910
The next time your students cause trouble,

440
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,380
you're fired.

441
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm not afraid to lose my job for them.

442
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,920
Where're you going?

443
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,100
To settle the matter.

444
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,300
- That's crazy.
- They'll kill you.

445
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,870
I don't wanna owe her.

446
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,460
Let's start. Take your seats.

447
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,490
What happened?

448
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,400
Takasugi took off.

449
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:30,170
To settle things with the bikers.

450
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,750
He's gonna get his ass kicked.

451
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:49,030
You guys, why'd you let him go?

452
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,160
Why let him go alone?

453
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,860
Because...

454
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,070
Those guys are seriously bad...

455
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,070
Aren't you his friends?!

456
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,440
Yankumi...

457
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:20,650
Her ideas on friends and loyalty...

458
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:27,260
They're meaningless and annoying at first.

459
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,260
We thought so too.

460
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,010
But now we understand.

461
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,370
The things she taught us...

462
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,220
Calling yourselves friends is easy

463
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,790
but that's just talk.

464
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,330
If you're friends for real,

465
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:06,370
you stick together no matter what happens.

466
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:09,560
Right?

467
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,910
What now?

468
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,650
What should we do?

469
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,000
You have balls coming here alone.

470
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,640
Fight me 1-on-1.

471
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,210
1-on-1?

472
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:52,820
If I win, stay away from us and our school.

473
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,250
Did you hear that?

474
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,090
Stop laughing!

475
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:08,360
Too bad. I don't fight 1-on-1.

476
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:59,600
Let him go... my precious student.

477
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,520
Who the hell are you?!

478
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,120
I'm his homeroom teacher.

479
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,090
A teacher?

480
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,450
You really messed him up.

481
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,190
You're pathetic.

482
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,090
All of you ganging up on
one high school kid.

483
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,400
We're teaching him a lesson.

484
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,440
He gets this for being a cocky asshole.

485
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,970
Common sense, right?

486
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,370
Don't make me laugh.

487
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,850
Common sense?

488
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,620
Don't pretend like you know
what you're talking about!

489
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,380
Watch it.

490
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,070
If words aren't enough, I'll fight you.

491
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,470
Let me warn you.

492
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,500
I don't hold anything back
to protect my students.

493
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,140
Odagiri.

494
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,500
Fighting is done with bare hands.

495
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:23,110
Haven't had enough?!

496
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,050
Odagiri... thanks.

497
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,550
Whatever.

498
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,700
Reita!

499
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,940
You okay?

500
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,800
Yeah.

501
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,740
Sorry you had to come alone.

502
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,810
We're so sorry.

503
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,450
Forget about it.

504
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,720
You guys...

505
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,970
Now you're real friends.

506
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,290
So reckless, you...

507
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,900
No, you... What teacher fights?

508
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,970
This one.

509
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,180
You fight to protect the things you cherish.

510
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,450
Things you cherish?

511
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,910
Yeah.

512
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:41,220
I cherish you guys.

513
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,160
Teachers have to protect their students.

514
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,280
All right! Let's run into the sunset!

515
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,340
Follow my lead!

516
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,950
You guys, follow me!

517
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,660
What a weird teacher.

518
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,900
She is.

519
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,100
But no one else tries so annoyingly hard to

520
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:31,300
relate to us.

521
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,710
What sunset?

522
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:57,960
Stop!

523
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,970
Stop!

524
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,700
Good morning.

525
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,900
Good morning.

526
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,570
G'morning.

527
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,770
Morning.

528
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,250
Mochizuki, Matsushita, Igarashi, Muto...

529
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,950
What?

530
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:56,020
Did you just say that to me?

531
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:59,320
Who else is there?

532
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,260
You complaining?

533
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:03,920
Finally...

534
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,640
You guys are opening up to me.

535
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,210
From now, the mornings will be...

536
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:21,910
Good morning.

537
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,590
Good morning, Yankumi!

538
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,950
Good morning.

539
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,490
Good morning, Yankumi!

540
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,430
Good morning!

541
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:37,030
Good morning, Yankumi!

542
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:39,000
Good morning, class.

543
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,570
My beloved students.

544
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,440
I knew it would come!

545
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:52,150
A lovely morning like this!

546
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,550
You'll be late for the faculty meeting.

547
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,120
Oops.

548
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,450
Don't be late, you guys!

549
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,530
Look who's talking.

550
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,830
Now that I am the principal

551
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,270
I want you teachers to be

552
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,940
strict with your pupils.

553
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,650
The first semester is almost over.

554
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,250
The final exams start
next week so classes will be

555
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,080
shortened starting today.

556
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,750
Many students take advantage of the situation

557
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:43,390
and use the extra time to
play around and get in trouble.

558
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:48,870
Please make sure you prevent that.

559
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:53,470
Yesterday, a student in Ara High

560
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,310
was arrested for drug possession.

561
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,580
For drugs?

562
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:00,310
Miss Yamaguchi!

563
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,990
Idiot.

564
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,250
You're late.

565
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,720
I'm sorry.

566
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:13,060
Drug possession by a student
is a serious problem.

567
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,460
A teacher being late...

568
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:17,030
Nowadays, even college students

569
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:20,070
and ordinary housewives are doing drugs.

570
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,330
Is that true?

571
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:26,270
They don't understand
the terrible consequences.

572
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,410
Drugs destroy the body and soul.

573
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:31,880
It's frightening.

574
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:34,680
I hear a big drug ring is
running the operation.

575
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,890
That's unforgivable.

576
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,690
Getting rich by selling drugs...

577
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,300
Where's their sense of duty and justice?

578
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,300
- Duty?
- Justice?

579
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,600
Miss Yamaguchi!

580
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,830
Such no-good rotten scumbags

581
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:00,640
need a serious beatdown!

582
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,010
You're talking like a yakuza.

583
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,910
Excuse us.

584
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,730
Who are you?
We're in a meeting.

585
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,120
- We're the police.

586
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,250
- Police?

587
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,390
"Faculty Room"

588
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,730
Kazama dealing drugs?

589
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:30,640
It can't be true.

590
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,700
He's not that kind of guy.

591
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,610
It must be a mistake.

592
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,840
We were informed about

593
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,420
a drug deal in a warehouse.

594
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:49,650
When we arrived there...

595
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,960
The dealers were gone.

596
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:02,130
But we found evidence and a wallet.

597
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:04,200
Look.

598
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,670
It belongs to

599
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:10,780
Ren Kazama.

600
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,310
That doesn't prove he's the culprit.

601
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,750
That's right.

602
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,560
But he's been missing since last night.

603
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:35,360
You guys, listen!

604
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,440
The cops are after our
upperclassman Kazama.

605
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,540
What did he do?

606
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:43,240
They said he sold drugs.

607
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,110
You're kidding.

608
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,760
A former student, a criminal...

609
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:04,230
It's not for certain.

610
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,440
I suppose so but...

611
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,940
I think it's true though.

612
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,280
Me too.

613
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,550
He's 19, still just a kid.

614
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,720
Perhaps he wanted to make
some easy money.

615
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,090
He'd never do anything like that.

616
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:39,600
"My child would never..."
is an unsafe thought.

617
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:45,070
And if he's innocent,
why would he be in hiding?

618
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,840
I'm sure there's a reason.

619
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:59,820
Odagiri, take care of the class.

620
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,990
You're not going
to go look for him, are you?

621
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,230
He's not your student anymore.

622
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,890
You're wrong.

623
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,140
He is my student.

624
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,300
Miss Yamaguchi...

625
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:19,970
Miss Yamaguchi...

626
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,850
Your call cannot be connected.

627
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,550
Kazama...

628
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:00,910
You guys...

629
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,690
Kura told me about Ren.

630
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,830
The cops came to the office this morning.

631
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,460
Ren might get fired.

632
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,660
Oh no...

633
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,860
He'll never do anything illegal.

634
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,100
There must be a reason
why he's running.

635
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,900
- Yeah.
- There's gotta be.

636
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,210
We believe in Ren.

637
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,740
He's our friend.

638
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:38,050
Let's find him.

639
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,660
You guys...

640
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,460
Let's go find him!

641
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:24,760
That way.

642
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:29,500
You go that way.

643
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:40,380
Let's split up.

644
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,950
Takasugi...

645
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,890
Have you seen Kazama?

646
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:53,120
No.

647
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,490
He's in trouble, right?

648
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:57,630
He's done nothing wrong.

649
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,440
If you see him, let me know.

650
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,340
Thanks.
=====

651
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,190
Let's split up.

652
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,340
"Yankumi"

653
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,970
Your call cannot be...

654
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,070
Where is he?

655
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,360
She never came back.

656
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:06,690
I don't know what happened

657
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:11,200
but you should tell Yankumi.

658
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,540
I don't wanna trouble her.

659
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,410
She's not my...

660
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,350
Teacher anymore?

661
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,760
She's not like that.

662
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,640
Do you have a place to go?

663
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,850
This was the only place, huh?

664
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,460
Kazama!

665
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:10,920
Ren!

666
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,130
Thank God.

667
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,960
Why are you running around
without telling us anything?

668
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,130
We were worried.

669
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:22,430
You should've called.

670
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,630
We're your friends, aren't we?

671
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,870
You're not alone, you know.

672
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:31,110
You're hurt.

673
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,920
I'm fine.

674
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,350
Kazama...

675
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,060
Why didn't you come to me?

676
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:50,800
Why?

677
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:53,900
Say something.

678
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:02,940
He didn't want to trouble you.

679
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:11,390
You'll go out of your way to help him.

680
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:18,660
That's why he didn't tell you.

681
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,560
Right?

682
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,100
Kazama...

683
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,670
In high school...

684
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,300
I caused you so much trouble.

685
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,470
Even now, after I graduated...

686
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:46,090
I was ashamed.

687
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:53,530
Listen... A teacher

688
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,930
welcomes trouble from her students.

689
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,130
But I'm not your student.

690
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,560
You...

691
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:05,110
are my precious student.

692
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,370
Right now, I'm in charge of this class.

693
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:14,610
But you guys who graduated

694
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,480
and students from other schools...

695
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:19,760
Are all my precious students.

696
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,990
And you're not alone.

697
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,130
Not just them.

698
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,260
Everyone else from 3D

699
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,770
was looking for you.

700
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:00,960
Sorry.

701
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,100
You guys...

702
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,040
I'm so sorry.

703
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:16,140
Sorry.

704
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,380
So sorry...

705
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,190
I...

706
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,200
found this sweet job through a friend.

707
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,470
All I had to do was

708
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:50,080
make a delivery as instructed.

709
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,750
But something was odd.

710
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,030
Over here.

711
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,670
Open it.

712
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,270
Yes.

713
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:31,310
Open the box.

714
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,260
Put it in the car.

715
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:51,770
I'm sorry.

716
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,200
You klutz!

717
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,350
This is something bad, isn't it?

718
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,730
I'm quitting.

719
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,160
I didn't realize
what I was delivering.

720
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,000
You want money, right?

721
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:29,940
You gotta do "something bad"
to make 30,000 yen a night.

722
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,510
It's too late.

723
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,310
You abetted a crime.

724
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:41,020
Just do as you're told.

725
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:42,960
Mr. Terada.

726
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,630
All right.

727
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,400
The cops are coming.

728
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:13,420
I was scared and ashamed.

729
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:19,090
I didn't know what to do.

730
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:21,130
Why did you accept the job?

731
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,790
I wanted money.

732
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,900
Money?

733
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,900
Once I started working,

734
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:34,080
I thought I could support my sister.

735
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,510
But my salary's so low...

736
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,820
That's why

737
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:51,790
I jumped at the opportunity.

738
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:57,360
I was an idiot.

739
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,200
Listen, Kazama.

740
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,280
Trying to make money isn't bad.

741
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:17,490
But don't be fooled by quick easy money.

742
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,480
Money is important.

743
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,890
But it's not everything.

744
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:32,330
Don't ever forget that.

745
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,670
You guys too.

746
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,510
Okay.

747
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:55,490
You can stay at my house for a while.

748
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,960
Yankumi is amazing.

749
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:07,570
I've never known a teacher like her.

750
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:10,340
She hasn't changed.

751
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,770
Still no sex appeal.

752
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,700
Yankumi is...

753
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,910
still Yankumi.

754
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,850
Sorry to get you involved.

755
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,330
Whatever.

756
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,970
I'll see you.

757
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:43,670
Odagiri.

758
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,970
You seem troubled too.

759
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:55,150
Everything's cool...

760
01:05:58,820 --> 01:05:59,880
Okay.

761
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:05,390
My Lady, this guy Terada...

762
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,560
You were right.
He's a drug dealer.

763
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,430
So it's true.

764
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:13,260
He avoids getting caught

765
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:17,100
by making the greenhorns deliver the dope.

766
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:18,930
The bastard.

767
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:23,640
Enticing innocent guys with money

768
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,080
and involving them in crime...

769
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,980
But Kumiko...

770
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:34,180
There's a ringleader.

771
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,590
Ringleader?

772
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,750
Him.

773
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,490
Kentaro Kurose.

774
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:51,770
He uses his success
and legit company as a front

775
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,170
for his drug business.

776
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,950
He wants power and position
to make more money.

777
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,660
A crook trying to become a politician...

778
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,400
"From failure to success"

779
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:26,400
Unforgivable.

780
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,840
Where're you off to alone?

781
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:23,690
I don't want to interfere with
what you do for your students

782
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:27,830
but this time is different.

783
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:36,110
You're risking your job as a teacher.

784
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:39,350
You sure about this?

785
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,790
I can't ignore these bastards

786
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:50,930
who tried to take advantage
of my precious student.

787
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:55,460
Kumiko!

788
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:02,740
I taught my students a few things.

789
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,400
Don't lie.

790
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,440
Live with pride and dignity.

791
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,480
That's why

792
01:09:11,950 --> 01:09:17,080
I can't pretend not to know
what Kurose truly is.

793
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,060
I see.

794
01:09:24,430 --> 01:09:26,230
We have a problem.

795
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:27,590
Those guys are gone.

796
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:45,440
This is it.

797
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,610
It's huge.

798
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,980
We should find some evidence here.

799
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,990
Yeah, let's nail those jerks.

800
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,560
How do we get inside?

801
01:09:56,730 --> 01:09:58,630
The security looks tough.

802
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,120
What's that?

803
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:05,100
"Kurose Campaign Rally"

804
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,460
Campaign rally?

805
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:11,070
Let's go to the back.

806
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:17,610
Ogata, what are you doing?
Where are you?

807
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:19,880
At the ringleader's.

808
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:21,070
What?

809
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,590
Kentaro Kurose, right?

810
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,790
You idiot! Come back!

811
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,520
That car!

812
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,900
Now.

813
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,260
Hello?

814
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:48,570
Those reckless fools.

815
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,160
Odagiri...

816
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:12,330
Hop on.

817
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:28,750
"Math class today: Study period"

818
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,720
Weird... Yamaguchi took the day off.

819
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,130
Odagiri too. Strange huh.

820
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:43,130
Do you think something
happened with Kazama?

821
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:49,670
Kurose is running for office...

822
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,900
We're at Kurose's campaign rally.

823
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:13,290
Yankumi...

824
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:14,800
Ryu!

825
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,160
Tsucchi...

826
01:12:16,430 --> 01:12:19,430
Tsuchiya, what are you doing here?

827
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:24,560
Working. Assistant cameraman.

828
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,370
Yeah?

829
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:29,200
I still have a lot to learn.

830
01:12:29,380 --> 01:12:32,010
We'll fill you in later.

831
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,510
Let's go.

832
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:41,060
Kurose's campaign rally is about to begin.

833
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:44,920
Many supporters have gathered here.

834
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,460
Was that?

835
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:49,560
Why is she there?

836
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:56,760
Wasn't that Miss Yamaguchi and Odagiri?

837
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:58,070
I saw them too.

838
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:03,510
That's not possible.
They're both sick today.

839
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:05,580
The principal's right.

840
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,220
It wasn't them.

841
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,460
Odagiri's late.

842
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,760
You are late.

843
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:44,180
No drugs anywhere.

844
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:48,380
Maybe he keeps them somewhere else.

845
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,650
Where are we?
We're lost.

846
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,760
Is Kurose really the ringleader?

847
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,130
Hide!

848
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,140
That's him.

849
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:31,430
Kentaro Kurose's campaign
rally is about to begin.

850
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:36,440
The IT giant is running for
a seat in the Lower House.

851
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,870
This is a live broadcast.

852
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:42,770
Kurose! Kurose!

853
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,850
Where did they go?

854
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,260
It's starting.

855
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:42,930
There's nothing.

856
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,810
It's the box.

857
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,000
Open the box.

858
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:23,470
Ren!

859
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:24,910
What is it?

860
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:41,600
There it is.

861
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:45,630
Then all these boxes?

862
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,700
Now we have proof.

863
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:51,700
What're you doing there?!

864
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,470
Kazama!

865
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:07,820
You shouldn't be here.

866
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:12,090
Now I can't let you leave.

867
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,560
I'm happy to see you all here today.

868
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,970
Thank you for coming.

869
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:33,940
I stepped off the path
during high school and

870
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,510
was even arrested by the police.

871
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:41,250
But now, thanks to your

872
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,690
and many people's support,

873
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,290
I've found my place in society.

874
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,910
Kids should keep their noses out.

875
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,050
Yankumi!

876
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:18,220
You guys okay?

877
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,330
This was stupid of you.

878
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:24,230
Sorry.

879
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,560
We almost died.

880
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:27,600
I almost peed in my pants.

881
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,910
A society where youth can dream.

882
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:39,210
Catch the dream.

883
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,090
Kurose... You're unforgivable.

884
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:52,430
I'll handle things from here.

885
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,300
What're you talking about?!

886
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:58,660
I can't put you guys in any more danger.

887
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,730
But...

888
01:19:00,170 --> 01:19:03,610
Odagiri, take care of them.

889
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,510
Yankumi!

890
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:10,870
Why'd you let her go?!

891
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:12,680
We can't just leave her!

892
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:18,210
We'll do the things we can do.

893
01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:26,960
I know what it feels like
to be labeled a delinquent.

894
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:31,990
I can reform the education system.

895
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,770
In this unjust world,

896
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,730
education is most important.

897
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,640
To foster compassion,

898
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:47,270
parents, teachers, and

899
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,110
the people of the country
must be united in the heart.

900
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,150
Don't make me laugh!

901
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:11,070
Compassion huh?

902
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:13,800
Who are you?

903
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,380
Me?

904
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:23,580
Just a high school teacher.

905
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:41,870
A crooked money monger
pretending to be a do-gooder

906
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:46,410
have no right preaching
about education and compassion.

907
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:58,680
Is there something you'd like to say?

908
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,990
Miss Yamaguchi...

909
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:17,500
You're kidding...

910
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,710
Look.

911
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,310
It's Yamaguchi.

912
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:28,280
Yamaguchi!

913
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,510
What is she doing?

914
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:31,350
She's gonna get it.

915
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,070
My Lady...

916
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:53,670
Katayama!

917
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:56,870
Matsukata!

918
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:58,680
Let's go!

919
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,950
How dare you use my precious student

920
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:07,490
for your dirty money-making scheme.

921
01:22:09,260 --> 01:22:13,090
I don't know what you're talking about.

922
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:14,630
Stop the act!

923
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,960
What you are is the leader of a drug ring.

924
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:38,020
I think you should stop now.

925
01:22:38,250 --> 01:22:40,550
You're troubling everyone here.

926
01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:42,760
Escort her outside.

927
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,690
I'm here with a major scoop.

928
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,000
We found something in the
Dream Associates' basement.

929
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:57,730
Look at this.

930
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:06,080
They're all drugs.

931
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,840
This place is the hub of a drug trade.

932
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,350
Drugs everywhere!

933
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,720
Thanks, Tsucchi.

934
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:22,820
Continue the broadcast.

935
01:23:24,430 --> 01:23:27,060
Tsuchiya, good job.

936
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:42,610
Those reckless fools.

937
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:45,290
Why?

938
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,250
There's something else over here.

939
01:23:49,730 --> 01:23:53,020
These men work for Mr. Kurose.

940
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:58,160
Look at what they have.

941
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:00,230
Guns!

942
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,070
Very dangerous.

943
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,100
You all should be careful.

944
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,470
Those men are probably armed too.

945
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:26,450
Please calm down, folks!

946
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,860
This is a mistake!

947
01:24:38,570 --> 01:24:40,060
Let's get in there!

948
01:24:58,530 --> 01:25:00,430
How could this happen?

949
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,000
You bitch...

950
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:13,640
Don't screw with me.

951
01:25:14,740 --> 01:25:17,410
Showing your true colors now?

952
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,820
Get her.

953
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,870
Watch out!

954
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:22,940
Odagiri, why are you here?

955
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:25,280
I can't let you fight alone.

956
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,210
Odagiri!

957
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:33,620
This brat's gonna die!

958
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:40,020
Don't worry about me! Just get them!

959
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,360
Yankumi!

960
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:49,240
Crush them!

961
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:53,870
Stop it!

962
01:27:04,690 --> 01:27:06,480
Stop!

963
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,980
Get your hands off our teacher!

964
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,840
You guys...

965
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:31,170
Who are you?

966
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:34,210
We're...

967
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,780
her students.

968
01:27:38,790 --> 01:27:41,020
Teacher-pupil love, is it?

969
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:43,450
I don't want to hurt you.

970
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:45,990
Get out of here.

971
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:48,160
No frickin' way!

972
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:51,460
We're not gonna desert her!

973
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:53,760
She's our precious teacher!

974
01:27:56,240 --> 01:28:00,200
We owe her everything!

975
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:04,240
You're up against all of us!

976
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:19,590
Yankumi taught us to fight

977
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,990
to protect what we cherish.

978
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:25,660
That's why

979
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:29,730
we'll fight you to protect her!

980
01:28:38,350 --> 01:28:39,910
Stay away!

981
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,450
Stay away from these scum.

982
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:55,700
You're my precious students.

983
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,770
I'm not putting you in any more danger.

984
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:04,400
We can't just sit and watch you get beat up!

985
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:07,300
I said, stay away!

986
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,480
I'm not gonna let you

987
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:18,820
ruin your futures

988
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:22,920
for dirty lowlifes like them.

989
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:31,790
You guys are my dream.

990
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,150
Still want more?

991
01:30:40,570 --> 01:30:42,230
Wait! Hey!

992
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:45,400
Come back!

993
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,740
Now, Mr. Kurose...

994
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,640
it's just you.

995
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,130
Kurose had a gun!

996
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:16,570
The police cannot move in.

997
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,470
Yamaguchi...

998
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:30,210
Move! Our teacher's inside!

999
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,620
Yankumi...

1000
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:45,670
Yankumi...

1001
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:52,230
Yankumi?!

1002
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:00,570
Yankumi...

1003
01:32:10,090 --> 01:32:11,490
Miss Yamaguchi!

1004
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:24,300
Everything I built

1005
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,370
you just destroyed.

1006
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:35,040
Everything you built was worthless anyway.

1007
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,610
Did you say worthless?

1008
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:46,090
Money means nothing when
you step on people to get it.

1009
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,850
Stop acting like a saint!

1010
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,000
Money is money.

1011
01:32:57,410 --> 01:32:59,600
Is it that important to you?

1012
01:33:01,080 --> 01:33:03,540
Society only trusts

1013
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,680
those who have money.

1014
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,140
Look at me.

1015
01:33:11,450 --> 01:33:15,290
The more money I made,
the more supporters I had.

1016
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,680
With money,

1017
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,990
I can have anything.

1018
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:30,200
Nowadays, you sure can buy
most things with money.

1019
01:33:31,310 --> 01:33:32,570
But...

1020
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,740
you can't move people's hearts.

1021
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,670
Hearts?

1022
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:44,380
Your henchmen left you, didn't they?

1023
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:48,190
But not these guys.

1024
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:52,720
Even with you and your gun,
they won't budge.

1025
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:05,030
You're right.
Money is important.

1026
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:11,440
But some things are more important.

1027
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:15,970
Friends, family...

1028
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:20,950
Working hard for them
and spending time with them.

1029
01:34:21,120 --> 01:34:22,820
That's happiness.

1030
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,450
Such small happiness.

1031
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,260
There's no difference!

1032
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:31,460
Happiness is

1033
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:37,540
being proud with the sun shining on your face.

1034
01:34:38,810 --> 01:34:40,830
Money can't buy it.

1035
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,140
There're times you don't feel like laughing.

1036
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:52,090
But don't give up.
Hang in there.

1037
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,380
If you mess up, regret it.

1038
01:34:59,160 --> 01:35:01,990
Have the courage to start over.

1039
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,160
Then you'll find happiness.

1040
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:14,810
That's what my students do.

1041
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:22,350
They were all like you before.

1042
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:26,510
Hopeless outcasts...

1043
01:35:27,460 --> 01:35:31,360
They still get in trouble,

1044
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:37,030
get fired from work and have money problems.

1045
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:43,370
But they live with pride and dignity.

1046
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:53,310
You know why?

1047
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:01,320
They have something they cherish.

1048
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:08,720
Friends that are connected in the heart.

1049
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:54,280
Freeze!

1050
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:03,950
Don't shoot!

1051
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:07,750
Give him a chance.

1052
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,820
To pay for his crime and start over.

1053
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:38,980
Yankumi!

1054
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:47,120
You guys...

1055
01:37:57,040 --> 01:37:59,100
You know...

1056
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,800
You guys are lucky.

1057
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,080
To have teacher like her...

1058
01:38:23,970 --> 01:38:25,630
Yankumi!

1059
01:38:28,570 --> 01:38:30,230
I'm okay.

1060
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,500
Yamaguchi!

1061
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:43,580
Takasugi...

1062
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:48,510
You guys came?

1063
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,490
Stop acting like a nut case.
You're a teacher.

1064
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,810
Tsuchiya...

1065
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,050
Thanks.

1066
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:50,480
Thanks.

1067
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,750
Thanks.

1068
01:39:59,090 --> 01:40:01,030
You guys are all...

1069
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,630
my wonderful students.

1070
01:40:14,610 --> 01:40:19,210
That's my high school teacher.

1071
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:31,960
Yankumi...

1072
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:39,130
I have big shoes to fill.

1073
01:40:58,150 --> 01:41:01,850
I bet the director and principal are so mad.

1074
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,960
I can't make excuses.

1075
01:41:06,230 --> 01:41:09,760
I'll have to apologize.

1076
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,230
Hey...

1077
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:19,200
Hi, Yankumi.

1078
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:22,500
Minami! How are you?!

1079
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:23,940
Okay.

1080
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:29,120
I saw you on TV.
I'm glad you haven't changed.

1081
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,620
Come on...

1082
01:41:30,990 --> 01:41:33,750
I remembered high school.

1083
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:36,920
You made me feel like working harder.

1084
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,590
Good for you.

1085
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,400
I have to get to work. See ya.

1086
01:41:50,070 --> 01:41:52,670
Bye! Good luck!

1087
01:41:56,410 --> 01:41:58,780
Minami hasn't changed.

1088
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,970
I know.

1089
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,580
Noda!

1090
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,910
Long time no see.

1091
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,320
What are you doing here?

1092
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,860
Probably the same as Minami.

1093
01:42:15,060 --> 01:42:18,460
I hit a wall at my job

1094
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:22,630
but I saw you on TV yesterday.

1095
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,530
I felt encouraged.

1096
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:27,570
I wanted you to know.

1097
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,370
Noda...

1098
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,270
See ya.

1099
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:39,610
See ya.

1100
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,390
You really are

1101
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:52,930
a teacher we're proud of.

1102
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:06,350
Bye! Good luck!

1103
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:25,220
Uchiyama!

1104
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:30,360
Minami and Noda came too?

1105
01:43:30,570 --> 01:43:31,500
Yeah.

1106
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:34,430
You peas in a pod...

1107
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:36,980
We're your students.

1108
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:44,380
Your words cut straight to the gut.

1109
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:47,280
I still think about them.

1110
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,520
You do, huh...

1111
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:01,700
You stay the you we know.

1112
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:07,240
Uchiyama...

1113
01:44:09,180 --> 01:44:12,510
Off to another day at work.

1114
01:44:12,850 --> 01:44:14,470
You be cool.

1115
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:19,250
Thanks for waiting.

1116
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:20,320
Let's go.

1117
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:30,530
Bye, Uchiyama!

1118
01:44:31,630 --> 01:44:32,960
Thanks!

1119
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:05,830
Good morning.

1120
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,770
Miss Yamaguchi!

1121
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:10,800
I'm very sorry!

1122
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:12,660
You're...

1123
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,510
the pride of our school.

1124
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:24,680
A teacher like you
so dedicated to her students

1125
01:45:24,820 --> 01:45:27,950
is a principal's joy.

1126
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:31,930
Thank you.

1127
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,360
What's happening?

1128
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,360
The phones are ringing nonstop.

1129
01:45:41,740 --> 01:45:43,970
There're tons of email too.

1130
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:47,970
The whole country was moved by you.

1131
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:54,440
Our school achieved national fame.

1132
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:57,920
We'll have more applicants next year.

1133
01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,350
All thanks to Miss Yamaguchi.

1134
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,720
Bravo.

1135
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:04,590
You're being too kind.

1136
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:06,560
She's right.

1137
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,620
Director.

1138
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:17,630
For whatever reason,
putting students in such danger

1139
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:21,500
shows your inexperience as a teacher.

1140
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:23,470
Yes, ma'am.

1141
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:27,440
You must do better from now.

1142
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:42,690
It really was reckless of you.

1143
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:50,960
One moment.

1144
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:57,140
Timely magazine wants to do an article on you.

1145
01:46:57,710 --> 01:46:58,870
An article?

1146
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:00,480
I wanna be in it too.

1147
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:03,210
You can introduce your colleagues.

1148
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:06,910
Wait a minute. Don't get so excited.

1149
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,420
But it's a magazine article.

1150
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,820
Miss Yamaguchi.

1151
01:47:12,660 --> 01:47:15,150
Don't get carried away.

1152
01:47:17,030 --> 01:47:20,800
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

1153
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:22,160
I know.

1154
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:23,700
Do you really?

1155
01:47:23,870 --> 01:47:25,460
Yes, I do.

1156
01:47:25,570 --> 01:47:27,040
I've had to repeat myself.

1157
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:30,300
You're so persistent, Vice Principal.

1158
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,210
- Principal.

1159
01:47:31,350 --> 01:47:32,110
- I know.

1160
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:32,940
- You don't.

1161
01:47:33,080 --> 01:47:34,280
- I do.

1162
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:47,860
It's your last day here.

1163
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:51,020
Yes, thank you.

1164
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:56,000
I heard you specifically requested

1165
01:47:56,070 --> 01:47:59,040
to be assigned here at Akado.

1166
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:05,940
Did you find something?

1167
01:48:09,650 --> 01:48:14,210
Being a teacher isn't too bad.

1168
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:18,390
I see.

1169
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:24,090
Thank you.

1170
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:46,180
Today is Mr. Odagiri's last day.

1171
01:48:50,430 --> 01:48:51,720
So...

1172
01:48:52,660 --> 01:48:58,030
we'll play Kick the Can to make memories.

1173
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,530
Let's go!

1174
01:49:05,210 --> 01:49:06,830
To the field!

1175
01:49:13,210 --> 01:49:15,980
Where're you going?

1176
01:49:21,690 --> 01:49:23,160
Why not?!

1177
01:49:29,660 --> 01:49:31,530
Gotcha!

1178
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:36,640
Where are they?

1179
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,550
Gotcha!

1180
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:07,630
Miss Yamaguchi!

1181
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:23,710
Gotcha!

1182
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,390
Yankumi.

1183
01:50:43,570 --> 01:50:44,730
Thanks.

1184
01:50:44,970 --> 01:50:46,170
What?

1185
01:50:47,010 --> 01:50:48,270
Nothing.

1186
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:51,840
Odagiri.

1187
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:59,480
If anything's troubling you,
come back anytime.

1188
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:08,990
I'm your teacher until I die.

1189
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:22,440
Watch out, Yankumi!

1190
01:51:22,910 --> 01:51:23,970
"Yankumi"?

1191
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,180
Did you call me Yankumi?

1192
01:51:38,190 --> 01:51:42,790
Let's run into the sunset!

1193
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:57,600
So, what sunset?

1194
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:35,510
Go for it!

1195
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,950
The glory days of youth.

1196
01:53:01,680 --> 01:53:06,050

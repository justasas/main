1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,990
Stop it! Let me go!

2
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,170
Jang-Mi! What are you doing to her?

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:19,320
Hello, Tae-Ran, I'm almost here.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,130
You're already outside?

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,030
Come to the roadside.

6
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,960
Stop it!

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,230
Officer!

8
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,970
What the heck?

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,930
Myung-Pil!

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,910
I'm going to go crazy!

11
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,310
Follow that car!

12
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,260
What's the matter?

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,270
It's an emergency! Go after that car!

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,340
- Episode 8 -

15
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,330
Someone has been kidnapped!

16
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,150
Oh! Suk-Doo!

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,040
It's an emergency!

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,260
I have to go!

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,040
Su-Duk!

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,900
I have to go!

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,200
Go faster! We have to follow that car!

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,050
What's going on?

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,230
Faster!

24
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,140
Where are you, Guk-Hee?

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,060
I just passed the Bukak Tunnel.

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,090
The Bukak Tunnel?

27
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:46,890
They're passing
the Bukak Tunnel! Hurry!

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,340
They're passing the
Bukak Tunnel right now.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,260
The Bukak Tunnel!

30
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,280
Jang-Mi!

31
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,340
What the heck?

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,070
What's going on?

33
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,190
Let me go!

34
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,910
Jang-Mi, stay still.

35
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,100
Let me go!

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,350
Jang-Mi, I'm really sorry,
but where's Lee Yun-Shil?

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,280
We have to find her.

38
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,330
Are you crazy? Let me go!

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,010
Shut up! Where's Lee Yun-Shil?

40
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,260
You killed her! You had her cremated!

41
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,870
I know that she's still alive!

42
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,040
If you don't bring her back,
I'll kill you too!

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
Stay still.

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
Heck no! Let me go! I want out!

45
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,250
Be quiet!!

46
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,100
This is your fault. You undermined me.

47
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,340
Let me go!

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,270
Hey Jang-Mi, are you okay?

49
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,220
Take it easy.

50
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,060
Shut up!

51
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,360
This wouldn't have happened
if you kept an eye on Lee Yun-Shil!

52
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,340
I'm going to ask you one last time.

53
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,320
Where's Yun-Shil?

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,010
Jang-Mi! Are you okay?

55
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,100
Oh! Guk-Hee! There you are!

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,200
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,190
I can't let you get beaten up
in the middle of the street!

58
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,970
Don't make me mind your business!

59
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,910
Mind your own business!

60
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,330
That's what we agreed on!

61
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,270
Yes, so could you please move out?

62
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,160
I told you that I'm going
to get the house back.

63
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,320
The house? After a million years?

64
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,270
Do you think you have
magic powers or something?

65
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,020
There you go again.

66
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,060
You're all talk!

67
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,310
Stop it! Why are you guys fighting?

68
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,890
If you want to fight, then fight at home!

69
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,080
You're making it sound like
I'm doing this because I want to!

70
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,290
What?

71
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,000
Freeze!

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
Put your hands up!

73
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,950
Put your hands up!

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,930
These two...

75
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,130
Come out! Come out!

76
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,170
Uh...

77
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,210
Guk-Hee! Jang-Mi! Are you guys okay?

78
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,900
Yes, I'm okay. How about you?

79
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Why, that...

80
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:02,070
You mean he's White Pants...
and he tried to kill his wife?

81
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,260
That's crazy!

82
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,980
And they kidnapped her?

83
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,960
Yes.

84
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,040
We've been living in the same neighborhood with him!

85
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,020
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

86
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,030
Did you get botox on your brain?
I already told you that.

87
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,920
But they're...

88
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,880
Are you leaving?

89
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,050
- We can handle this ourselves!
- No! I don't want to!

90
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,910
According to
Criminal Code 276 Article 1...

91
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,330
...anyone who arrests
and confines another person...

92
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,200
...will serve either 5 years or less in prison or fined with $7,000 or less.

93
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,330
Kidnapping is a crime.

94
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,270
Did you hear that?

95
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,310
How many times do I have to tell you?

96
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,040
She's my wife! I didn't kidnap her!

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,000
Do you consent?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,890
No, I don't.

99
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,980
Apologize for calling me 'Fatso'
and give me my money back.

100
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,210
If you don't...

101
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,310
Don't point your finger at me!

102
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,990
Why, I ought to...

103
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,160
Injury and violence. Code 257.

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,030
Anyone who exercises violence upon...

105
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,050
...his/her family or
his/her spouse's family...

106
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,120
...will either serve 10 years or less in prison or fined with $15,000 or less.

107
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,090
That's a serious offense. Understand?

108
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,970
We lost Kim Jo-Han again.

109
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,920
He left his car.

110
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,330
License plate number 02DA8025.

111
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,240
Run the plate and
don't tell the Chief. Bye.

112
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,330
Please leave a message after the tone.

113
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:57,160
I'll promise you that
I'll never talk to Guk-Hee again.

114
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,200
I'll never go see Guk-Hee on my own will.

115
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Satisfied?

116
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,010
I'm too scared to go home.

117
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll stay with you and protect you for now.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,070
Are you sure?

119
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,070
Yes.

120
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:36,280
What am I going to tell her?

121
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,180
Tae-Ran, I was at a workshop...

122
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,000
Just play dumb!

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,290
She might let you off the hook
if you act as if nothing happened.

124
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh, my gosh!

125
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,980
Tae-Ran?

126
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,340
You were home?

127
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,190
You must've been worried about me.

128
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,070
Gosh, it's hard to be working man.

129
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,270
Are you trying to play dumb?

130
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,080
I saw you follow Guk-Hee.

131
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,910
You have a lot of explaining to do.

132
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,190
White Pants tried to kill someone.

133
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,150
He hired Sniff, who happens
to be Jang-Mi's husband.

134
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:01,900
He kidnapped her because
someone took his insurance money.

135
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:06,020
Guk-Hee somehow got
herself into the mess.

136
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,190
Why are you looking at me like that?

137
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,960
Do you think you're making any sense?

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,940
Huh? Yes...

139
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:26,230
I didn't believe her at first either, but she was telling the truth.

140
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,170
You're acting just like Guk-Hee.

141
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,310
What you're trying to tell me is that
you don't have any feelings...

142
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,930
...and that you're just
reacting to the situation.

143
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,210
This too hard for me to handle.

144
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,250
You promised me that you're
not going to talk to her again.

145
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,980
I was just reacting to the situation.

146
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,900
What are you going to do
if there's another situation?

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,970
This is too hard for me to handle.

148
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,980
My editor wants me to re-do my work.

149
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:07,180
I'm getting stressed out
because of Guk-Hee.

150
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,100
This is got to stop.

151
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,170
If you don't, I'll be disappointed in you.

152
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Hello, I'm disqualified to be a good wife.

153
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,240
Tomorrow's my first oral proceeding.

154
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:40,160
I never coveted
someone else's property.

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,070
I only wanted to keep what's mine.
Why is that so difficult a task?

156
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,230
Are you guys going
through the same thing?

157
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,900
Why do we need to fight to live in peace?

158
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,920
What are you doing?

159
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,020
I've never fought with anyone in my life.

160
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,900
Now that I'm taking it to the civil court,
I feel nervous.

161
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,970
Guk-Hee, let's go outside.

162
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:11,340
Tae-Ran, we've been talking
too much in all this commotion.

163
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,870
Why don't we use our
body language instead?

164
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,190
Uh-huh.

165
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,100
What did you say?

166
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,020
We've been talking too much...

167
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,990
Let's use our body language...

168
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,950
How am I supposed to emphasize
the romantic part here?

169
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,220
Do you have a lot of editing to do?

170
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,990
I thought you'll be done soon.

171
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,940
Don't wait for me. Go to sleep.

172
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,880
One, two, three...

173
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,870
At ease.

174
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:10,300
Next, we breathe in the moonlight.

175
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,900
Repeat after me.

176
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,260
Muzeap Sepire Cartage.

177
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,940
What?

178
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,870
Muzeap Sepire Cartage.

179
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,940
Muzeap what?

180
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,300
Come on...

181
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,930
Muzeap Sepire Cartage!

182
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,980
Muzeap Sepire Carta...

183
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,090
What's that? It sounds weird.

184
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,170
You smiled!

185
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:48,300
You told me that you're
nervous about the lawsuit.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,140
Are you relaxed now?

187
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,880
Yes, but what does that mean?

188
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,000
What does that mean?
Are you sure it's a yoga term?

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,040
I...like...you.

190
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,210
If you keep messing around,
I'm going to sue you too.

191
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,170
At least you're relaxed.

192
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:21,230
Why don't we chant the spell again?

193
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,080
Muzeap Sepire Cartage...

194
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,960
The deposit?

195
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,150
Why do you look so surprised?

196
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,290
The homeowner has
a right to break the contract.

197
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:43,980
She's going to give you $40,000, double the deposit you gave her, as penalty.

198
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,140
I'll pay you $40,000.

199
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,920
I don't want to sell that house.

200
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,020
What happened?

201
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,280
The homeowner paid the penalty.

202
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,320
She wants to fight until the end.

203
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:20,290
Guk-Hee, come over here.

204
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,900
Look at all these replies to your post.

205
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,350
Look!

206
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,330
Cheer up, Gyung Guk-Hee!

207
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,960
'I hope you get your house back!'

208
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,050
Everyone's cheering you on.

209
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:36,360
Someone here wrote,
'I hate that homeowner!'

210
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,970
All the other married
women are talking about...

211
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,310
...how much trouble
they're going through.

212
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:52,930
All the other housewives didn't have anyone to complain to, just like us.

213
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,100
How sad.

214
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,220
Life's tough.

215
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,110
They work all day, but get no recognition.

216
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,190
You're right.

217
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,090
But then again, we've been
through the same thing.

218
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:14,930
Why don't we get
ourselves a homepage?

219
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,100
A homepage?

220
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Sounds great!

221
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,060
Are you going to call it 'Good Wife'?

222
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:29,260
No, it'll be 'Good Wife...'

223
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,190
Good Wife....Disqualification Club?

224
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,990
Good Wife Disqualification Club!

225
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,870
Great!

226
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,350
One, two, three!

227
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,940
I like this one.

228
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,990
Much better.

229
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,140
I'm off to work.

230
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,180
Did you pull an all-nighter?

231
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,930
Did you have breakfast?

232
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,270
The bread's in the oven.

233
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,890
I'll be home early.

234
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,240
Let's rest together.

235
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,070
I didn't take a shower yet.

236
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,230
It happens when I have
a deadline to meet.

237
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,250
Thanks for the gift, Yun-Shil.

238
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,360
I wanted to see you again,
but I didn't know how to contact you.

239
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,920
I'm sorry I didn't visit you until now.

240
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,050
I'll bring an even better gift
for you guys later.

241
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:26,180
Did you really live in our orphanage?

242
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,050
Why?

243
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:33,960
Do you think I can grow up
to be a great person like you?

244
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,090
I'm not a great person.

245
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:43,270
I'm sure you'll be an even
greater person when you grow up.

246
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,890
It's an unlisted number.

247
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,280
Hello?

248
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,210
It's me, Yun-Shil.

249
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,130
Yun-Shil?

250
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,160
Where are you?
We've been worried about you!

251
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,080
Is she alive?

252
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,200
Where is she?

253
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,880
Uh-huh. White Pants
knows that you're alive.

254
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,170
Guk-hee, is Jang-Mi okay?

255
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:28,330
That's a relief.

256
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

257
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,290
I have more work to do.
I'll go back after I'm done.

258
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,240
Bye.

259
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,990
- How is she doing?
- Where did she say she was?

260
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,200
She sounds like she's doing fine.

261
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:17,180
Uh...I have something to say.

262
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,080
What is it?

263
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:33,280
When I was living with you...The fact that I didn't listen to what you had to say...

264
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,130
Can we talk privately?

265
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,120
We can talk here.

266
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,260
Just pretend I'm a tree.

267
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,030
Just pretend I'm a bird up on that tree.

268
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,170
Guk-Hee!

269
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,000
Hi, Suk-Doo!

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,120
Hey! Why are you here?

271
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,190
Go home!

272
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,220
I'm living with them.

273
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,160
What?

274
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,880
Is that true?

275
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,030
Are you living with this kid?

276
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,930
First, the other women, and now him?

277
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,920
What am I going to do with you?

278
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,310
Hello, Tae-Ran.

279
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,100
What am I going to do?
The house is on fire!

280
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,910
Come home!

281
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,980
What?

282
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:56,260
Did you pull an all-nighter?

283
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,160
Yes, I was getting prepared for the lawsuit.

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,210
All I have left now is the trial.

285
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,200
You're working too hard.

286
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,990
We should go...to the sauna!

287
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:16,150
What am I going to do?

288
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,920
Myung-Pil!

289
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,230
Myung-Pil!

290
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,200
Oh, no...Tae-Ran!

291
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,210
I was going to splash water in the oven, but it got on you too.

292
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:36,090
I'm so sorry!

293
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,090
What's wrong with me?

294
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,300
Everything's going wrong!

295
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,880
All I wanted was a piece of bread!

296
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,230
Look at me!

297
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:49,920
Tae-Ran, calm down.

298
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,010
I'll make you feel better.

299
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,270
This is just a happening.

300
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,150
I'll take today off from work.

301
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,170
Let's take a break together.

302
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,020
I'm so sorry.

304
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,290
I'll let you off the hook
because you're pretty.

305
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,150
Married women are strong.

306
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,930
You'll be dead meat if you mess with us.

307
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,070
Su-Duk knows how to head butt.

308
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,050
My husband fainted.

309
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:49,930
Look who we have here.

310
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,200
I hate this.

311
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:09,350
Looks like we have trouble.

312
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,240
Why do they keep following us?

313
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,000
Tae-ran, do you want to leave?

314
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,180
Why? We didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:26,930
You're right. We should
stay and have fun.

316
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,270
I'm thirsty. I want something to drink.

317
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,240
Do you want rice punch?

318
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,990
Wait for me over there.

319
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,100
Thank you.

320
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,980
Are you getting her something to eat? I'm impressed.

321
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,900
Please don't prowl around me anymore.

322
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,220
Prowl around?

323
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,130
You prowled around me this morning because you had something to say.

324
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:03,890
We were here first.

325
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,900
Maybe you're following me.

326
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,030
Do you think I prowled around?

327
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,360
Do you think I'm following you?

328
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,150
I really had something
to say this morning...

329
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,080
...and this is the only sauna
in the neighborhood.

330
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,020
So you really are following me.

331
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,060
I really had something to say!

332
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,110
What is it?

333
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:31,210
When I was with you...
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

334
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,150
Guk-Hee!

335
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,290
The furnace is on.

336
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,940
The furnace?

337
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,070
Let's go.

338
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,920
If you keep nagging me,
I'm going to quit writing!

339
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,250
Gosh, you look so happy together?

340
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,300
Are you really going to live with him?

341
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,120
Whatever.

342
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:33,030
She's a complete stranger now.

343
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,060
You're asking for too much!

344
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:56,880
What are you trying to say?

345
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:10,120
That felt good.

346
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,310
What are you doing?

347
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,150
You scared me!

348
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,250
What are you doing?

349
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,180
Let me ask you one question.

350
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,000
Do you like that kid?

351
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,060
Yes.

352
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,240
You like that kid?

353
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,910
Yes, he's a great guy.

354
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,950
Yes? Yes?

355
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:48,000
Yes? Did you say, 'yes'? Did you?

356
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,070
Tae-Ran!

357
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,950
Hey!

358
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:42,140
I had to use the restroom.

359
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,100
Let's go.

360
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:50,960
Why? What about the rice punch?

361
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,980
Now I'm sure.

362
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,300
You're still attached to him.

363
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,940
Attached?

364
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:18,230
I was a little bothered by you,
but I don't feel the need anymore.

365
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:24,280
You're prowling around Myung-Pil because you want him to notice you.

366
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,260
How foolish.

367
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,920
Getting a man's heart back
after he left you...

368
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,310
...is harder than bringing an audience
to a crappy movie.

369
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,090
You can't win this game.

370
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,240
Just shake if off, will you?

371
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,360
What are you doing?

372
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,190
You wanted me to shake it off.

373
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,290
Hi.

374
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,170
What? Aren't you going to get dressed?

375
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,890
Aren't you going to take your pants off?

376
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,080
These are my pants! Why do you care?

377
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,070
Sorry.

378
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:51,100
Hey kid, do you like hanging out
with older women?

379
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,010
Do your parents know about this?

380
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,050
I've been living away from them
since junior high.

381
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,360
They don't know the details.

382
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,870
What?

383
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,210
Let me get straight to the point.

384
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,320
Get out of that house.

385
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,280
Maybe Guk-Hee's hanging out
with you because she's out of it.

386
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,180
Both you and Guk-Hee need to grow up.

387
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,180
You're the one who needs to grow up.

388
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,080
What?

389
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,890
Everyone knows that.

390
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:30,350
Hey kid!

391
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:37,330
I was a little offended because
you kept on calling me a kid.

392
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:45,870
But then again, your body tells me
that we have a good age gap.

393
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,300
What?

394
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,980
Why, you...

395
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,910
Ouch!

396
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,000
Why, you...

397
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Stop it!

398
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,220
You dork!

399
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,300
When I count to three,
let each other go, okay?

400
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,020
One, two, three!

401
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,010
- What are you doing?
- Myung-pil!

402
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,170
Tae-Ran!

403
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,060
Oh-no! Suk-Doo!

404
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,190
Too bad.

405
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,190
I'm not the fool who's still attached.

406
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:51,910
You should keep an eye on him.

407
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,000
What?

408
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,270
Let's go.

409
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:00,060
Tae-Ran, let's go.

410
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,910
Tae-Ran!

411
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,890
Tae-Ran!

412
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:43,190
If we take Guk-Hee's kids, she'll have
no choice but to give us Yun-Shil.

413
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,120
Stop staring at the picture, will you?

414
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,000
Hello?

415
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,060
It's me.

416
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,090
You better not do anything to Guk-Hee, Jang-Mi, and Su-Duk.

417
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:03,260
Why shouldn't I?

418
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,910
Because you want money.

419
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:15,050
You married a banker like me
so you can get that loan.

420
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,910
So?

421
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,910
If you want the insurance money, get Sniff off your trail and come by yourself.

422
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,920
I'll see you at 3pm on the 25th.

423
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,960
Come to the place you proposed to me.

424
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,030
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

425
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,910
Oh, it was a loan shark.

426
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,210
He's nagging me to pay him back.

427
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,020
Money! Money! Money!

428
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,950
We have to change our plan.

429
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,310
Why? We're almost there.

430
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,110
I have to take care of him first.

431
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,170
Let's get back to her after I'm done.

432
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,130
Kill some time before I'm back.

433
00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:01,050
You can go meet your wife.

434
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,220
Are you a pervert?

435
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,210
You've been smacked.

436
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,180
- Why are you smiling?
- Yeah.

437
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,010
Oh no, do you have head injury?

438
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,970
Do you feel nauseous?

439
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,350
No, I'm smiling because...

440
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:27,080
When fighting for love,
whoever punches first loses.

441
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,250
Wow! Pretty impressive.

442
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,950
Looks like Guk-Hee's husband
has met his match.

443
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,040
You're right.

444
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,090
Too bad you ended up
fighting at the sauna.

445
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:45,960
Why don't hold a pork belly party
to make ourselves feel better?

446
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,160
- Okay!
- Okay!

447
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,310
Guk-Hee! Do you want pork belly?

448
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,080
Sounds good.

449
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,150
Let's go grocery shopping together!

450
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,190
Shopping? Sounds good!

451
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:06,270
Oh, I'll bring some
snake wine from home.

452
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,990
I'll get the place ready.

453
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,240
You two should go
shopping by yourselves.

454
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,060
Jang-mi!

455
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,180
Let's go.

456
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,900
Shall we?

457
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,320
Tae-Ran!

458
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:24,290
Tae-Ran!

459
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,160
Myung-Pil

460
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,280
Please leave a message...

461
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,140
Gyung Guk-Hee!

462
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,110
The door's unlocked. Come in.

463
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,920
Jang-Mi.

464
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,320
Go away!

465
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,190
Stay away from me!

466
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,320
No, not today.

467
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,220
Go away!

468
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,080
Guk-Hee, this is a dead end.

469
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,950
It's do or die!

470
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,940
Come on...

471
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:28,160
Jang-Mi! Jang-Mi!

472
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,140
I have something to tell you!

473
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:34,310
Why are you running away?

474
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:41,980
Guk-Hee!

475
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,030
Su-Duk!

476
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,950
- I brought snake wine.
- Su-duk!

477
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,120
Why so little? It's too little!

478
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,060
It's for you.

479
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:57,090
You never know when
you'll get in another fight.

480
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,890
What happened?

481
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:05,880
Who is it?

482
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,890
Honey! Honey, wake up!
What are you doing here? Honey!

483
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,180
Honey, get up! What's wrong with him?

484
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:15,870
Honey, get up! Wake up!

485
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,890
What happened?

486
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:29,940
Uh...I don't know why you left me.

487
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,130
What did I do wrong?

488
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:38,350
After you quit your detective job, you locked me up in that house for 3 years.

489
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:43,200
You disconnected our phone
and internet service.

490
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,180
You still don't know what you did wrong?

491
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,070
That's because you were
cheating on me!

492
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:51,310
Why did you open a bar?

493
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,180
Why do you think I opened a bar?

494
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,330
To meet men.

495
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,280
I hate dealing with people.

496
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,080
I wanted you to become a cop again.

497
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,180
I was willing to make money
if you can go back to preserving justice.

498
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,120
That's why I willingly did
something that I hate.

499
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,880
Why didn't you tell me that?

500
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,010
Nothing would've happened
if you told me that.

501
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,970
I prayed every night
for you to go back to your old self.

502
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:34,960
But you drank everyday
and battered me day after day...

503
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,130
After a thousand days, I left you.

504
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,020
Myung-Pil! Myung-Pil!

505
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,980
Where am I?

506
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,320
Jang-Mi's house.

507
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,180
I thought you were
knocked unconscious.

508
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,910
Then you snored.

509
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,230
Why do you keep getting
yourself into trouble?

510
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:41,310
Trouble? Me?

511
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:47,270
Right, I can't believe this either.

512
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,990
I'm scared of getting out of bed.

513
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,220
Not a day goes by in peace.

514
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:01,880
That's exactly what I told you
while I was living with you.

515
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,040
I didn't know how things went wrong.

516
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,910
I had too much to do,
and didn't know how to do them.

517
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,010
It happens.

518
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:20,040
You try to explain, but you'll feel
agitated if no one listens to you.

519
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,050
You should go home.

520
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,890
Guk-Hee.

521
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,920
I'm sorry.

522
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:49,260
I wanted to tell you
this morning that I'm sorry.

523
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,900
I'm sorry for not listening to you,
and embarrassing you.

524
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:03,170
I thought I should apologize.

525
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:08,310
'I'm sorry...'?

526
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:15,000
I can't believe you just said that.

527
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,250
It just happened.

528
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:23,230
It just happened?

529
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,170
I see.

530
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:31,320
But you're being irresponsible.

531
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,270
I think I've taken you for granted.

532
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:46,190
I never took time to
appreciate what I have.

533
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,980
I took you for granted.

534
00:45:50,990 --> 00:46:01,210
I want to say something too.

535
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:15,300
I don't know if I fully explained to you who I am and what makes me happy.

536
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:21,270
Someone persevered and
explained for 1,000 days.

537
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,210
I don't think I've tried that hard.

538
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:34,240
I think I should apologize for that.

539
00:46:36,110 --> 00:46:40,220
Our life was too dry.

540
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,160
We've been too busy
making money, having kids...

541
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,140
...and buying a house that we didn't talk.

542
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:53,160
It's too late now.

543
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:06,320
But I'm glad we got to tell each other that we're sorry and got it off our chest.

544
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:14,320
The Sly Fox is here.

545
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,080
Tae-Ran?

546
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:30,120
Guk-Hee, tell her that I'm not here.

547
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:38,030
I made that commotion at the sauna.
I can't let her know that I'm here.

548
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:42,180
Please tell her that I'm not here!

549
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:44,180
That means I'm hiding you!

550
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:51,090
Just this once! Please tell her
that I'm not here.

551
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,870
I'll do anything you say!

552
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:09,870
I'm sorry for intruding.

553
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,100
What is it?

554
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,120
I just...

555
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,930
Shouldn't you tell us why you're here?

556
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:33,290
I was wondering if Eun-Suk
and Gi-Suk are here.

557
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,100
They're with their grandmother.

558
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,930
You know that too.

559
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,890
Right.

560
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:54,040
Myung-Pil's here, right?

561
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,890
Answer me.

562
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:03,020
You can call his name out
if you want to find out.

563
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:18,210
Tae-Ran...

564
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,100
Hey.

565
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,970
You told me that Tae-Ran
boosts your ego, right?

566
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,090
Where's your ego now?

567
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,270
Bye.

568
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:32,010
Tae-Ran, listen to me.

569
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,960
Guk-Hee

570
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,990
Hello?

571
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,040
It's me, Guk-Hee.

572
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:03,920
What did you want to see me about?

573
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,980
Let's not make this
harder on each other.

574
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,070
What do you mean?

575
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:17,890
I know how it feels to see your man
get tangled up with another woman.

576
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:23,150
I experienced first-hand, thanks to you.

577
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,250
What happened today was
just a coincidence.

578
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,890
You don't have to fight with Myung-Pil.

579
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,110
Are you taking his side?

580
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,340
No, I'm doing this because it's over.

581
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:46,940
We're going to court tomorrow,
and everything will be over.

582
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,320
You told me that it's hard to
get a man's heart back, right?

583
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,010
I don't want it back.

584
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:02,100
My heart left him already.

585
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:06,020
You don't need to fight with Myung-Pil.

586
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,910
Why are you telling me this?

587
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:16,320
It was tough for me when I had
a feud with Myung-Pil over you.

588
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:27,120
Maybe it would've been easier
to handle if I had money like you do.

589
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,180
My family was my everything.

590
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,210
I was scared and in pain.

591
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:47,340
I would've sold my soul if anyone offered to save me from that mess.

592
00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:57,130
I don't want anyone to go
through that pain anymore...

593
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:04,200
...including you and Myung-Pil.

594
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:16,000
I'm not perfect, but I loved him with all my heart and gave him everything I had.

595
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,020
I gave my all to my family...

596
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,100
...so I don't have any regrets.

597
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,220
Anyways, we were on the wrong track, and this is where we ended up.

598
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:35,020
We can't go back,
and I don't want to go back.

599
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:38,010
I won't get in your way.

600
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,970
I hope you're happy with him.

601
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:38,290
You'll be very busy tomorrow.

602
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:49,170
I never thought it would end like this.

603
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,870
Do you want me to go with you?

604
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:58,220
No.

605
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:01,920
Thanks, Suk-Doo.

606
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,360
I owe what I am to you.

607
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:18,090
After you get everything settled, I want you to say something besides thank you.

608
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:24,920
Don't you feel sorry for me?

609
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:30,150
It's okay for me to wait, right?

610
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,930
Sure, you can wait.

611
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:40,120
But I get to decide
what I'm going to say to you.

612
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,180
Did you bring all the paperwork?

613
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,130
And your ID?

614
00:56:57,130 --> 00:56:58,220
I brought them.

615
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:01,210
Let's go.

616
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,200
Hey...

617
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:11,960
Uh...well...

618
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,890
- ...nothing.
- Let's go.

619
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:39,980
Do you consent to the divorce,
Ms. Gyung Guk-Hee?

620
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:42,000
Yes.

621
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,290
Do you consent to the divorce, Mr. Hur Myung-Pil?

622
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:53,030
Mr. Hur Myung-Pil?

623
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:55,320
Huh?

624
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,930
What are you doing?

625
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:07,930
Do you consent to the divorce? Do you?

626
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,210
I'm not sure.

627
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:12,150
What?

628
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,120
You don't want a divorce?

629
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,910
I'm...not sure!

630
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,910
Are you out of your mind?

631
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,940
I can't help it. I'm not sure!

632
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,070
I'm not sure about what I want either.

633
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:29,870
Let me think about it.

634
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:32,880
Hey! Hur Myung-Pil!!

635
00:58:33,900 --> 00:59:49,920

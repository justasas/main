1
00:00:01,773 --> 00:00:03,741
Let's split up.

2
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,792
"Yankumi"

3
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,422
Your call cannot be...

4
00:00:59,798 --> 00:01:02,528
Where is he?

5
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,811
She never came back.

6
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,141
I don't know what happened

7
00:01:55,787 --> 00:01:58,654
but you should tell Yankumi.

8
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:07,992
I don't wanna trouble her.

9
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:12,864
She's not my...

10
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,808
Teacher anymore?

11
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:28,216
She's not like that.

12
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:38,094
Do you have a place to go?

13
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:48,300
This was the only place, huh?

14
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,911
Kazama!

15
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:58,377
Ren!

16
00:02:59,151 --> 00:03:00,584
Thank God.

17
00:03:03,755 --> 00:03:07,418
Why are you running around
without telling us anything?

18
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,581
We were worried.

19
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:09,887
You should've called.

20
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:12,087
We're your friends, aren't we?

21
00:03:12,264 --> 00:03:14,323
You're not alone, you know.

22
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,565
You're hurt.

23
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,372
I'm fine.

24
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,807
Kazama...

25
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:32,511
Why didn't you come to me?

26
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:38,253
Why?

27
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:41,350
Say something.

28
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:50,393
He didn't want to trouble you.

29
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:58,842
You'll go out of your way to help him.

30
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:06,111
That's why he didn't tell you.

31
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:09,014
Right?

32
00:04:13,392 --> 00:04:14,552
Kazama...

33
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,122
In high school...

34
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:23,757
I caused you so much trouble.

35
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,929
Even now, after I graduated...

36
00:04:28,707 --> 00:04:33,542
I was ashamed.

37
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:40,980
Listen... A teacher

38
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,383
welcomes trouble from her students.

39
00:04:43,555 --> 00:04:45,580
But I'm not your student.

40
00:04:45,757 --> 00:04:47,019
You...

41
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:52,562
are my precious student.

42
00:04:53,665 --> 00:04:57,829
Right now, I'm in charge of this class.

43
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:02,064
But you guys who graduated

44
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,936
and students from other schools...

45
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,211
Are all my precious students.

46
00:05:10,415 --> 00:05:14,442
And you're not alone.

47
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:17,585
Not just them.

48
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:21,717
Everyone else from 3D

49
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,225
was looking for you.

50
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,416
Sorry.

51
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:52,551
You guys...

52
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,493
I'm so sorry.

53
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,590
Sorry.

54
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:08,830
So sorry...

55
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:17,642
I...

56
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:23,653
found this sweet job through a friend.

57
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:33,925
All I had to do was

58
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:37,530
make a delivery as instructed.

59
00:06:38,336 --> 00:06:40,201
But something was odd.

60
00:06:58,256 --> 00:06:59,484
Over here.

61
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:09,129
Open it.

62
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:10,725
Yes.

63
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,769
Open the box.

64
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,717
Put it in the car.

65
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:39,223
I'm sorry.

66
00:07:39,397 --> 00:07:40,659
You klutz!

67
00:07:49,708 --> 00:07:53,804
This is something bad, isn't it?

68
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:59,182
I'm quitting.

69
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,618
I didn't realize
what I was delivering.

70
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,459
You want money, right?

71
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:17,396
You gotta do "something bad"
to make 30,000 yen a night.

72
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:19,963
It's too late.

73
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:23,769
You abetted a crime.

74
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,479
Just do as you're told.

75
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,411
Mr. Terada.

76
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,083
All right.

77
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,851
The cops are coming.

78
00:08:56,107 --> 00:09:00,874
I was scared and ashamed.

79
00:09:04,382 --> 00:09:06,543
I didn't know what to do.

80
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:08,585
Why did you accept the job?

81
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:10,243
I wanted money.

82
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:12,353
Money?

83
00:09:13,091 --> 00:09:15,355
Once I started working,

84
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,531
I thought I could support my sister.

85
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:26,964
But my salary's so low...

86
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,274
That's why

87
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:39,249
I jumped at the opportunity.

88
00:09:42,153 --> 00:09:44,815
I was an idiot.

89
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,659
Listen, Kazama.

90
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,735
Trying to make money isn't bad.

91
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:04,942
But don't be fooled by quick easy money.

92
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:08,937
Money is important.

93
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:12,342
But it's not everything.

94
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:19,780
Don't ever forget that.

95
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,129
You guys too.

96
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:35,962
Okay.

97
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:42,942
You can stay at my house for a while.

98
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:50,418
Yankumi is amazing.

99
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:55,022
I've never known a teacher like her.

100
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,794
She hasn't changed.

101
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,224
Still no sex appeal.

102
00:11:00,131 --> 00:11:02,156
Yankumi is...

103
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:05,366
still Yankumi.

104
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:19,306
Sorry to get you involved.

105
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,781
Whatever.

106
00:11:28,126 --> 00:11:29,423
I'll see you.

107
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:31,126
Odagiri.

108
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:37,427
You seem troubled too.

109
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,606
Everything's cool...

110
00:11:46,277 --> 00:11:47,335
Okay.

111
00:11:48,847 --> 00:11:52,840
My Lady, this guy Terada...

112
00:11:53,017 --> 00:11:57,010
You were right.
He's a drug dealer.

113
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:58,889
So it's true.

114
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,717
He avoids getting caught

115
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:04,553
by making the greenhorns deliver the dope.

116
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,388
The bastard.

117
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:11,099
Enticing innocent guys with money

118
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,533
and involving them in crime...

119
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:15,432
But Kumiko...

120
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:21,634
There's a ringleader.

121
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:23,041
Ringleader?

122
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,205
Him.

123
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:31,945
Kentaro Kurose.

124
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:39,223
He uses his success
and legit company as a front

125
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,624
for his drug business.

126
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:53,400
He wants power and position
to make more money.

127
00:13:01,786 --> 00:13:05,119
A crook trying to become a politician...

128
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,850
"From failure to success"

129
00:13:12,797 --> 00:13:13,855
Unforgivable.

130
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,299
Where're you off to alone?

131
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:11,145
I don't want to interfere with
what you do for your students

132
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:15,289
but this time is different.

133
00:14:18,196 --> 00:14:23,566
You're risking your job as a teacher.

134
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,800
You sure about this?

135
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:32,241
I can't ignore these bastards

136
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:38,380
who tried to take advantage
of my precious student.

137
00:14:41,352 --> 00:14:42,910
Kumiko!

138
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,190
I taught my students a few things.

139
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:52,854
Don't lie.

140
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,892
Live with pride and dignity.

141
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,935
That's why

142
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:04,535
I can't pretend not to know
what Kurose truly is.

143
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:10,510
I see.

144
00:15:11,883 --> 00:15:13,680
We have a problem.

145
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:15,045
Those guys are gone.

146
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:32,893
This is it.

147
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,067
It's huge.

148
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:38,436
We should find some evidence here.

149
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:41,443
Yeah, let's nail those jerks.

150
00:15:41,612 --> 00:15:44,012
How do we get inside?

151
00:15:44,182 --> 00:15:46,082
The security looks tough.

152
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,577
What's that?

153
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,555
"Kurose Campaign Rally"

154
00:15:52,723 --> 00:15:54,918
Campaign rally?

155
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,524
Let's go to the back.

156
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:05,067
Ogata, what are you doing?
Where are you?

157
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:07,337
At the ringleader's.

158
00:16:07,505 --> 00:16:08,529
What?

159
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:12,042
Kentaro Kurose, right?

160
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,240
You idiot! Come back!

161
00:16:15,413 --> 00:16:16,971
That car!

162
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,350
Now.

163
00:16:27,558 --> 00:16:28,718
Hello?

164
00:16:33,331 --> 00:16:36,027
Those reckless fools.

165
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,611
Odagiri...

166
00:16:58,489 --> 00:16:59,786
Hop on.

167
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,204
"Math class today: Study period"

168
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:22,172
Weird... Yamaguchi took the day off.

169
00:17:22,613 --> 00:17:25,582
Odagiri too. Strange huh.

170
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,583
Do you think something
happened with Kazama?

171
00:17:33,191 --> 00:17:37,127
Kurose is running for office...

172
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:40,355
We're at Kurose's campaign rally.

173
00:17:59,116 --> 00:18:00,743
Yankumi...

174
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:02,250
Ryu!

175
00:18:02,453 --> 00:18:03,613
Tsucchi...

176
00:18:03,888 --> 00:18:06,880
Tsuchiya, what are you doing here?

177
00:18:07,058 --> 00:18:12,018
Working. Assistant cameraman.

178
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,827
Yeah?

179
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,659
I still have a lot to learn.

180
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,462
We'll fill you in later.

181
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,967
Let's go.

182
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:28,511
Kurose's campaign rally is about to begin.

183
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:32,371
Many supporters have gathered here.

184
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,914
Was that?

185
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:37,019
Why is she there?

186
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:44,217
Wasn't that Miss Yamaguchi and Odagiri?

187
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:45,520
I saw them too.

188
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:50,962
That's not possible.
They're both sick today.

189
00:18:51,168 --> 00:18:53,033
The principal's right.

190
00:18:53,204 --> 00:18:54,671
It wasn't them.

191
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:10,918
Odagiri's late.

192
00:19:11,656 --> 00:19:13,214
You are late.

193
00:19:27,505 --> 00:19:31,635
No drugs anywhere.

194
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:35,835
Maybe he keeps them somewhere else.

195
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:40,109
Where are we?
We're lost.

196
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:43,219
Is Kurose really the ringleader?

197
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:45,581
Hide!

198
00:19:59,036 --> 00:20:00,594
That's him.

199
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:18,880
Kentaro Kurose's campaign
rally is about to begin.

200
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:23,890
The IT giant is running for
a seat in the Lower House.

201
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:26,325
This is a live broadcast.

202
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:30,227
Kurose! Kurose!

203
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:13,307
Where did they go?

204
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,711
It's starting.

205
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,389
There's nothing.

206
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:04,260
It's the box.

207
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,452
Open the box.

208
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,926
Ren!

209
00:22:11,302 --> 00:22:12,360
What is it?

210
00:22:27,585 --> 00:22:29,052
There it is.

211
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,088
Then all these boxes?

212
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:36,157
Now we have proof.

213
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,156
What're you doing there?!

214
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:46,928
Kazama!

215
00:22:52,843 --> 00:22:55,277
You shouldn't be here.

216
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:59,544
Now I can't let you leave.

217
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:08,016
I'm happy to see you all here today.

218
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,423
Thank you for coming.

219
00:23:16,233 --> 00:23:21,398
I stepped off the path
during high school and

220
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,969
was even arrested by the police.

221
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:28,704
But now, thanks to your

222
00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:32,144
and many people's support,

223
00:23:32,349 --> 00:23:34,749
I've found my place in society.

224
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:47,362
Kids should keep their noses out.

225
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:02,504
Yankumi!

226
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:05,677
You guys okay?

227
00:24:08,018 --> 00:24:10,782
This was stupid of you.

228
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:11,683
Sorry.

229
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:13,015
We almost died.

230
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,055
I almost peed in my pants.

231
00:24:20,497 --> 00:24:23,364
A society where youth can dream.

232
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,667
Catch the dream.

233
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,542
Kurose... You're unforgivable.

234
00:24:37,047 --> 00:24:39,880
I'll handle things from here.

235
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:41,750
What're you talking about?!

236
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,117
I can't put you guys in any more danger.

237
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,188
But...

238
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:51,061
Odagiri, take care of them.

239
00:24:55,532 --> 00:24:56,965
Yankumi!

240
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,328
Why'd you let her go?!

241
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:00,130
We can't just leave her!

242
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,668
We'll do the things we can do.

243
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:14,418
I know what it feels like
to be labeled a delinquent.

244
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:19,449
I can reform the education system.

245
00:25:19,923 --> 00:25:22,221
In this unjust world,

246
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,189
education is most important.

247
00:25:27,731 --> 00:25:30,097
To foster compassion,

248
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:34,728
parents, teachers, and

249
00:25:34,972 --> 00:25:39,568
the people of the country
must be united in the heart.

250
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:42,604
Don't make me laugh!

251
00:25:55,893 --> 00:25:58,521
Compassion huh?

252
00:25:59,997 --> 00:26:01,259
Who are you?

253
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:03,830
Me?

254
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:11,036
Just a high school teacher.

255
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:29,324
A crooked money monger
pretending to be a do-gooder

256
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:33,860
have no right preaching
about education and compassion.

257
00:26:42,873 --> 00:26:46,138
Is there something you'd like to say?

258
00:26:49,813 --> 00:26:51,440
Miss Yamaguchi...

259
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,959
You're kidding...

260
00:27:07,931 --> 00:27:11,162
Look.

261
00:27:11,301 --> 00:27:12,768
It's Yamaguchi.

262
00:27:14,605 --> 00:27:15,731
Yamaguchi!

263
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:16,963
What is she doing?

264
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:18,802
She's gonna get it.

265
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:35,523
My Lady...

266
00:27:39,863 --> 00:27:41,125
Katayama!

267
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,324
Matsukata!

268
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,130
Let's go!

269
00:27:48,572 --> 00:27:51,405
How dare you use my precious student

270
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,941
for your dirty money-making scheme.

271
00:27:56,713 --> 00:28:00,547
I don't know what you're talking about.

272
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:02,083
Stop the act!

273
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:09,414
What you are is the leader of a drug ring.

274
00:28:20,637 --> 00:28:25,472
I think you should stop now.

275
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,007
You're troubling everyone here.

276
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:30,211
Escort her outside.

277
00:28:33,851 --> 00:28:36,149
I'm here with a major scoop.

278
00:28:37,855 --> 00:28:42,451
We found something in the
Dream Associates' basement.

279
00:28:43,627 --> 00:28:45,185
Look at this.

280
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,531
They're all drugs.

281
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,298
This place is the hub of a drug trade.

282
00:28:58,508 --> 00:29:00,806
Drugs everywhere!

283
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:04,173
Thanks, Tsucchi.

284
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,277
Continue the broadcast.

285
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:14,517
Tsuchiya, good job.

286
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:30,065
Those reckless fools.

287
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:32,740
Why?

288
00:29:32,976 --> 00:29:36,707
There's something else over here.

289
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:40,479
These men work for Mr. Kurose.

290
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,613
Look at what they have.

291
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,681
Guns!

292
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,521
Very dangerous.

293
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:53,558
You all should be careful.

294
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,925
Those men are probably armed too.

295
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,907
Please calm down, folks!

296
00:30:14,584 --> 00:30:18,315
This is a mistake!

297
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,519
Let's get in there!

298
00:30:45,983 --> 00:30:47,883
How could this happen?

299
00:30:54,691 --> 00:30:56,454
You bitch...

300
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:01,094
Don't screw with me.

301
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,861
Showing your true colors now?

302
00:31:16,947 --> 00:31:18,278
Get her.

303
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:02,320
Watch out!

304
00:32:08,265 --> 00:32:10,392
Odagiri, why are you here?

305
00:32:10,801 --> 00:32:12,735
I can't let you fight alone.

306
00:32:14,638 --> 00:32:15,662
Odagiri!

307
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:21,070
This brat's gonna die!

308
00:32:23,346 --> 00:32:27,476
Don't worry about me! Just get them!

309
00:32:31,088 --> 00:32:32,817
Yankumi!

310
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:36,690
Crush them!

311
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:41,324
Stop it!

312
00:32:52,142 --> 00:32:53,939
Stop!

313
00:32:54,845 --> 00:32:57,439
Get your hands off our teacher!

314
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,295
You guys...

315
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:18,629
Who are you?

316
00:33:20,303 --> 00:33:21,668
We're...

317
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:25,238
her students.

318
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:28,473
Teacher-pupil love, is it?

319
00:33:28,912 --> 00:33:30,903
I don't want to hurt you.

320
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:33,449
Get out of here.

321
00:33:33,683 --> 00:33:35,617
No frickin' way!

322
00:33:36,186 --> 00:33:38,916
We're not gonna desert her!

323
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:41,215
She's our precious teacher!

324
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:47,652
We owe her everything!

325
00:33:47,831 --> 00:33:51,699
You're up against all of us!

326
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,045
Yankumi taught us to fight

327
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:10,443
to protect what we cherish.

328
00:34:11,354 --> 00:34:13,117
That's why

329
00:34:13,723 --> 00:34:17,181
we'll fight you to protect her!

330
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:27,360
Stay away!

331
00:34:33,176 --> 00:34:36,907
Stay away from these scum.

332
00:34:39,783 --> 00:34:43,150
You're my precious students.

333
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:48,220
I'm not putting you in any more danger.

334
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:51,856
We can't just sit and watch you get beat up!

335
00:34:52,729 --> 00:34:54,754
I said, stay away!

336
00:34:59,736 --> 00:35:01,931
I'm not gonna let you

337
00:35:03,473 --> 00:35:06,271
ruin your futures

338
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,370
for dirty lowlifes like them.

339
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:19,245
You guys are my dream.

340
00:36:18,014 --> 00:36:19,606
Still want more?

341
00:36:28,024 --> 00:36:29,685
Wait! Hey!

342
00:36:31,127 --> 00:36:32,856
Come back!

343
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:38,190
Now, Mr. Kurose...

344
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,094
it's just you.

345
00:36:57,454 --> 00:37:01,584
Kurose had a gun!

346
00:37:01,825 --> 00:37:04,020
The police cannot move in.

347
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:07,923
Yamaguchi...

348
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:17,669
Move! Our teacher's inside!

349
00:37:27,384 --> 00:37:29,079
Yankumi...

350
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:33,120
Yankumi...

351
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:39,689
Yankumi?!

352
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,027
Yankumi...

353
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:58,946
Miss Yamaguchi!

354
00:38:09,492 --> 00:38:11,756
Everything I built

355
00:38:13,496 --> 00:38:15,828
you just destroyed.

356
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:22,499
Everything you built was worthless anyway.

357
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:28,069
Did you say worthless?

358
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:33,545
Money means nothing when
you step on people to get it.

359
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,308
Stop acting like a saint!

360
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:43,453
Money is money.

361
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:47,056
Is it that important to you?

362
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:50,999
Society only trusts

363
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:55,135
those who have money.

364
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:58,598
Look at me.

365
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:02,742
The more money I made,
the more supporters I had.

366
00:39:03,646 --> 00:39:05,136
With money,

367
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,441
I can have anything.

368
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:17,651
Nowadays, you sure can buy
most things with money.

369
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,023
But...

370
00:39:20,597 --> 00:39:23,191
you can't move people's hearts.

371
00:39:25,134 --> 00:39:27,125
Hearts?

372
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,831
Your henchmen left you, didn't they?

373
00:39:33,276 --> 00:39:35,642
But not these guys.

374
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,172
Even with you and your gun,
they won't budge.

375
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:52,484
You're right.
Money is important.

376
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,899
But some things are more important.

377
00:40:00,436 --> 00:40:03,428
Friends, family...

378
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,407
Working hard for them
and spending time with them.

379
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:10,273
That's happiness.

380
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:13,906
Such small happiness.

381
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:16,710
There's no difference!

382
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:18,914
Happiness is

383
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:24,992
being proud with the sun shining on your face.

384
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:28,287
Money can't buy it.

385
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:33,591
There're times you don't feel like laughing.

386
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:39,541
But don't give up.
Hang in there.

387
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:45,836
If you mess up, regret it.

388
00:40:46,616 --> 00:40:49,449
Have the courage to start over.

389
00:40:52,088 --> 00:40:54,613
Then you'll find happiness.

390
00:40:58,328 --> 00:41:02,264
That's what my students do.

391
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:09,804
They were all like you before.

392
00:41:11,407 --> 00:41:13,967
Hopeless outcasts...

393
00:41:14,911 --> 00:41:18,813
They still get in trouble,

394
00:41:19,115 --> 00:41:24,485
get fired from work and have money problems.

395
00:41:26,055 --> 00:41:30,822
But they live with pride and dignity.

396
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:40,766
You know why?

397
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:48,776
They have something they cherish.

398
00:41:50,647 --> 00:41:56,176
Friends that are connected in the heart.

399
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:41,730
Freeze!

400
00:42:49,706 --> 00:42:51,401
Don't shoot!

401
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:55,202
Give him a chance.

402
00:42:56,012 --> 00:43:00,278
To pay for his crime and start over.

403
00:43:24,707 --> 00:43:26,436
Yankumi!

404
00:43:32,815 --> 00:43:34,578
You guys...

405
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:46,553
You know...

406
00:43:48,164 --> 00:43:51,258
You guys are lucky.

407
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:57,539
To have teacher like her...

408
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,081
Yankumi!

409
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:17,686
I'm okay.

410
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:19,956
Yamaguchi!

411
00:44:29,238 --> 00:44:31,035
Takasugi...

412
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:35,969
You guys came?

413
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:41,944
Stop acting like a nut case.
You're a teacher.

414
00:44:50,827 --> 00:44:52,260
Tsuchiya...

415
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:00,502
Thanks.

416
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:37,939
Thanks.

417
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,203
Thanks.

418
00:45:46,549 --> 00:45:48,483
You guys are all...

419
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:52,080
my wonderful students.

420
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:06,660
That's my high school teacher.

421
00:46:17,613 --> 00:46:19,410
Yankumi...

422
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:26,586
I have big shoes to fill.

423
00:46:45,608 --> 00:46:49,305
I bet the director and principal are so mad.

424
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:53,412
I can't make excuses.

425
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:57,210
I'll have to apologize.

426
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:04,686
Hey...

427
00:47:04,827 --> 00:47:06,658
Hi, Yankumi.

428
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,957
Minami! How are you?!

429
00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:11,396
Okay.

430
00:47:11,634 --> 00:47:16,571
I saw you on TV.
I'm glad you haven't changed.

431
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:18,070
Come on...

432
00:47:18,441 --> 00:47:21,205
I remembered high school.

433
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:24,379
You made me feel like working harder.

434
00:47:26,615 --> 00:47:28,048
Good for you.

435
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:33,854
I have to get to work. See ya.

436
00:47:37,526 --> 00:47:40,120
Bye! Good luck!

437
00:47:43,866 --> 00:47:46,232
Minami hasn't changed.

438
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:47,426
I know.

439
00:47:49,472 --> 00:47:51,030
Noda!

440
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:53,365
Long time no see.

441
00:47:53,576 --> 00:47:56,773
What are you doing here?

442
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:00,310
Probably the same as Minami.

443
00:48:02,518 --> 00:48:05,919
I hit a wall at my job

444
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:10,085
but I saw you on TV yesterday.

445
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:12,989
I felt encouraged.

446
00:48:13,429 --> 00:48:15,021
I wanted you to know.

447
00:48:18,267 --> 00:48:19,825
Noda...

448
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:23,728
See ya.

449
00:48:25,508 --> 00:48:27,066
See ya.

450
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:34,849
You really are

451
00:48:36,752 --> 00:48:40,381
a teacher we're proud of.

452
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:53,801
Bye! Good luck!

453
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:12,677
Uchiyama!

454
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:17,816
Minami and Noda came too?

455
00:49:18,027 --> 00:49:18,959
Yeah.

456
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:21,888
You peas in a pod...

457
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:24,431
We're your students.

458
00:49:26,802 --> 00:49:31,830
Your words cut straight to the gut.

459
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:34,739
I still think about them.

460
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:38,976
You do, huh...

461
00:49:45,821 --> 00:49:49,154
You stay the you we know.

462
00:49:53,362 --> 00:49:54,693
Uchiyama...

463
00:49:56,632 --> 00:49:59,965
Off to another day at work.

464
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:01,929
You be cool.

465
00:50:04,473 --> 00:50:06,703
Thanks for waiting.

466
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:07,774
Let's go.

467
00:50:16,018 --> 00:50:17,986
Bye, Uchiyama!

468
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:20,419
Thanks!

469
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:53,280
Good morning.

470
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:55,222
Miss Yamaguchi!

471
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:58,259
I'm very sorry!

472
00:50:58,627 --> 00:51:00,117
You're...

473
00:51:00,596 --> 00:51:02,962
the pride of our school.

474
00:51:06,802 --> 00:51:12,138
A teacher like you
so dedicated to her students

475
00:51:12,274 --> 00:51:15,402
is a principal's joy.

476
00:51:16,445 --> 00:51:19,380
Thank you.

477
00:51:24,453 --> 00:51:25,818
What's happening?

478
00:51:26,088 --> 00:51:28,818
The phones are ringing nonstop.

479
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:31,421
There're tons of email too.

480
00:51:31,594 --> 00:51:35,428
The whole country was moved by you.

481
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,896
Our school achieved national fame.

482
00:51:42,071 --> 00:51:45,370
We'll have more applicants next year.

483
00:51:45,541 --> 00:51:47,805
All thanks to Miss Yamaguchi.

484
00:51:47,876 --> 00:51:49,173
Bravo.

485
00:51:49,378 --> 00:51:52,040
You're being too kind.

486
00:51:52,214 --> 00:51:54,011
She's right.

487
00:51:57,953 --> 00:51:59,079
Director.

488
00:51:59,588 --> 00:52:05,083
For whatever reason,
putting students in such danger

489
00:52:05,261 --> 00:52:08,958
shows your inexperience as a teacher.

490
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:10,923
Yes, ma'am.

491
00:52:11,133 --> 00:52:14,899
You must do better from now.

492
00:52:25,648 --> 00:52:30,142
It really was reckless of you.

493
00:52:37,293 --> 00:52:38,419
One moment.

494
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:44,590
Timely magazine wants to do an article on you.

495
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:46,327
An article?

496
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:47,935
I wanna be in it too.

497
00:52:48,037 --> 00:52:50,665
You can introduce your colleagues.

498
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:54,367
Wait a minute. Don't get so excited.

499
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:55,873
But it's a magazine article.

500
00:52:56,011 --> 00:52:58,275
Miss Yamaguchi.

501
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:02,606
Don't get carried away.

502
00:53:04,486 --> 00:53:08,252
Nobody must find out
about your family business.

503
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:09,618
I know.

504
00:53:09,892 --> 00:53:11,154
Do you really?

505
00:53:11,327 --> 00:53:12,919
Yes, I do.

506
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:14,495
I've had to repeat myself.

507
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,758
You're so persistent, Vice Principal.

508
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:18,661
- Principal.

509
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:19,563
- I know.

510
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:20,394
- You don't.

511
00:53:20,536 --> 00:53:21,730
- I do.

512
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:35,315
It's your last day here.

513
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,477
Yes, thank you.

514
00:53:39,621 --> 00:53:43,455
I heard you specifically requested

515
00:53:43,525 --> 00:53:46,494
to be assigned here at Akado.

516
00:53:49,865 --> 00:53:53,392
Did you find something?

517
00:53:57,106 --> 00:54:01,668
Being a teacher isn't too bad.

518
00:54:04,646 --> 00:54:05,840
I see.

519
00:54:10,018 --> 00:54:11,542
Thank you.

520
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,635
Today is Mr. Odagiri's last day.

521
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:39,177
So...

522
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:45,485
we'll play Kick the Can to make memories.

523
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:50,982
Let's go!

524
00:54:52,661 --> 00:54:54,288
To the field!

525
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:03,433
Where're you going?

526
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:10,611
Why not?!

527
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,984
Gotcha!

528
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:24,090
Where are they?

529
00:55:35,571 --> 00:55:37,004
Gotcha!

530
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:55,082
Miss Yamaguchi!

531
00:56:09,938 --> 00:56:11,166
Gotcha!

532
00:56:28,857 --> 00:56:29,846
Yankumi.

533
00:56:31,026 --> 00:56:32,186
Thanks.

534
00:56:32,427 --> 00:56:33,621
What?

535
00:56:34,463 --> 00:56:35,725
Nothing.

536
00:56:38,066 --> 00:56:39,294
Odagiri.

537
00:56:41,403 --> 00:56:46,932
If anything's troubling you,
come back anytime.

538
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:56,445
I'm your teacher until I die.

539
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:09,896
Watch out, Yankumi!

540
00:57:10,365 --> 00:57:11,423
"Yankumi"?

541
00:57:12,367 --> 00:57:14,631
Did you call me Yankumi?

542
00:57:25,647 --> 00:57:30,243
Let's run into the sunset!

543
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:45,059
So, what sunset?

544
00:58:21,136 --> 00:58:22,967
Go for it!

545
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:28,400
The glory days of youth.

546
00:58:49,131 --> 00:58:53,500
You guys, follow my lead!

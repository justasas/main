1
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:23,290
There was an organization...

2
00:00:23,577 --> 00:00:27,444
... that created a drug
that made us immortal.

3
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:32,504
Transforming the living dead
into zombies.

4
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:35,132
That was 20 years ago.

5
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,306
Today, zombies dominate the Earth...

6
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:42,649
... and feed on people,
who afterwards ...

7
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:45,465
... also become undead.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,908
Humanity is being killed off.

9
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,048
Their disappearance is imminent.

10
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:02,989
Let's continue.

11
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,645
Aya!

12
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:12,110
One Chanbara - Vortex

13
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,507
Try not to move.

14
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,163
You are badly hurt.

15
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,407
You're Aya ...

16
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,509
... and Saki.

17
00:07:56,996 --> 00:07:58,953
The two sisters ...

18
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,881
... of the Imichi Clan.

19
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:06,025
I have been looking for you.

20
00:08:07,532 --> 00:08:08,613
Who are you?

21
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:12,131
Misery.

22
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,051
And I also ...

23
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,949
... must live with the
damned blood of the Imichi.

24
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:28,038
I need your help.

25
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:35,878
The Organization seeks
a pure blood Imichi.

26
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,628
Saki.

27
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,846
You're the first on the list.

28
00:08:44,332 --> 00:08:45,663
The Organization?

29
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:50,484
Have you heard of it?
The woman who controls it ...

30
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,686
... is called Himiko.

31
00:09:06,437 --> 00:09:07,950
What is this?

32
00:09:09,684 --> 00:09:11,383
Your parents were
among those ...

33
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,682
... killed by the Organization.

34
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,337
Before they died ...

35
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,280
... I begged them to surrender.

36
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,954
Himiko has incredible power.

37
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:32,768
They caught me,
but I was of no use to them.

38
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,836
But if no one stops them,
they will dominate the world.

39
00:09:40,697 --> 00:09:43,078
Therefore, we must fight together.

40
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:57,297
Saki!

41
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:01,040
We have to exterminate
those zombies at once.

42
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,446
We are not fighting for revenge.

43
00:10:21,908 --> 00:10:24,015
Saki, can you give me the red one.

44
00:10:28,397 --> 00:10:30,607
Girls, come with me right away!

45
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:35,701
Aya, listen carefully.

46
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,291
Himiko has mobilized
her people.

47
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,002
Himiko?

48
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,576
If something happens to us ...

49
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,321
... protect your little sister.

50
00:10:52,241 --> 00:10:53,779
Take care of Saki!

51
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:05,025
Misery. Don't creep up on me like that.

52
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:27,836
Saki, do you want to see your mother?

53
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,117
You said that she was dead.

54
00:13:35,827 --> 00:13:37,414
What do you know?

55
00:13:39,806 --> 00:13:41,408
You might be able to see her, but...

56
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:46,280
... I don't think Aya will agree.

57
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,931
Why?

58
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:51,332
Because she doesn't like to talk about your mother.

59
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:53,553
Besides ...

60
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,025
... the risk would be great.

61
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,760
I would do anything ...

62
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,413
... to see her again.

63
00:14:18,037 --> 00:14:19,450
Are you sure?

64
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,926
Then I'll help.

65
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:27,502
And one ...

66
00:14:28,347 --> 00:14:29,428
two

67
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:30,573
three

68
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:31,803
four

69
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:32,952
five

70
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:36,561
We will cut the zombies into pieces.

71
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,466
But first we need a solid foundation.
Lets begin again ... and one ...

72
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,460
two

73
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,683
three

74
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:44,818
four

75
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:45,982
five

76
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,812
Keep going! Count with me.

77
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,339
And one ...

78
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,344
Ryo?

79
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,878
Take care of the children.
I will go look for food.

80
00:15:09,134 --> 00:15:10,341
Be careful.

81
00:15:11,094 --> 00:15:12,768
Don't be a hero.

82
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,912
There have been increased attacks
in recent days.

83
00:15:15,284 --> 00:15:18,001
They are becoming stronger and stronger.

84
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:19,810
I know.

85
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,033
I will make sure that nothing happens to them.

86
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,351
And don't lose the whistle.

87
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,459
No way, I will not be
appetizer for any zombie.

88
00:15:33,383 --> 00:15:34,646
Take care.

89
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:37,505
Come back soon.

90
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:40,246
Will you play with us then?

91
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,616
- We want to go too!
- We will tear them to pieces.

92
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,545
Hey! Who said you can rest?

93
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:56,198
Do I rest? We will destroy them
like the last time.

94
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,703
Reiko was the one that did everything,...

95
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:01,890
... you were paralyzed with fear.
So do not be boastful.

96
00:16:01,996 --> 00:16:03,194
Follow!

97
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,256
What's up, Saki?

98
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:22,627
Nothing.

99
00:16:26,438 --> 00:16:27,825
Let's keep going.

100
00:16:52,602 --> 00:16:54,088
It's too quiet.

101
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:58,493
There should be zombies here, but
where are they?

102
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:01,926
Himiko is ...

103
00:17:02,074 --> 00:17:04,194
... protected by an elite zombie unit.

104
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,631
This unit is completely ...

105
00:17:07,923 --> 00:17:11,018
... under Himiko's control,
and should not be underestimated.

106
00:17:13,223 --> 00:17:14,608
What do you mean?

107
00:17:16,823 --> 00:17:18,840
Himiko must be very close.

108
00:17:24,364 --> 00:17:25,770
They are there.

109
00:17:27,097 --> 00:17:28,510
Are you ready?

110
00:18:08,995 --> 00:18:10,984
That's ... Himiko.

111
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:14,967
That girl ?

112
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:18,836
- Impossible!
- Do not trust appearances

113
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:25,814
Maybe between the 3 of us we can get her.

114
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,988
she is the carrier ...

115
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,731
...of the pure blood
of the imichi.

116
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:39,587
We have to kill her before the
other zombies come.

117
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,474
Were you looking for me?

118
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,304
Leave Kei alone, damn zombies!

119
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:32,845
Take them out back.

120
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,616
Come children!

121
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,934
What do you want?

122
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:53,039
Aya.

123
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,283
Reiko.

124
00:19:58,892 --> 00:19:59,914
Misery ...

125
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:02,251
She is not an enemy.

126
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,564
She's an old friend.

127
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,937
What are you doing here?

128
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,429
I could ask the same of you.

129
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:18,924
You! You are the one that commands the
zombies that I have been killing.

130
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:21,232
And I'll kick your ass too!

131
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,017
She is lying.

132
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,280
She is one of Himiko's zombies.

133
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:36,560
Were you looking for me?

134
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:39,965
Leave Kei alone, damn zombies!

135
00:20:46,107 --> 00:20:47,658
You'll be sorry!

136
00:21:17,496 --> 00:21:18,589
Stop!

137
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,301
Saki, what are you doing?

138
00:21:22,957 --> 00:21:24,293
It must be done!

139
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:28,851
There is a way to
resurrect our parents.

140
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:32,884
Don't you want to see them again?

141
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,259
The alarm whistle!

142
00:21:39,713 --> 00:21:41,574
I will continue with Himiko's plan.

143
00:21:46,403 --> 00:21:47,461
Out!

144
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,710
Saki!

145
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:51,474
Over here!

146
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,676
Over here! Hurry!

147
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:57,547
Hurry!

148
00:23:01,134 --> 00:23:02,198
Ryo!

149
00:23:03,387 --> 00:23:05,198
Kei and Yuta are gone!

150
00:23:11,082 --> 00:23:13,864
Don't worry!
Stay still and quiet!

151
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:47,547
Kei.

152
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:52,469
You're safe!

153
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:56,683
Come on.

154
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:05,922
I must find Yuta. Stay here.
The others are in a safe place.

155
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,669
I'll be right back, okay?

156
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,916
Good!

157
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:46,915
He's mine!

158
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,195
Come on!

159
00:24:52,684 --> 00:24:54,837
Look.
What's happening?

160
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:14,106
Are you okay?

161
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,623
No!

162
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:04,134
I could not ...

163
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:06,483
... protect them.

164
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:15,912
Continue with the condolences.

165
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:17,977
You must be furious.

166
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,217
A glorious death.

167
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:28,923
Kei!

168
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,638
Kei, come back to us!

169
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:45,888
You will understand, when it is finished.

170
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,503
Then we will be able...

171
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:54,606
... to live together again.

172
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,102
Saki!

173
00:29:52,662 --> 00:29:54,000
Freeze!

174
00:29:54,388 --> 00:29:56,020
She is an old friend.

175
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,995
That was before.

176
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:00,031
But what about now?

177
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,989
- How can I trust her!
- Ryo!

178
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:06,015
Reiko.

179
00:30:06,343 --> 00:30:07,861
He is absolutely right.

180
00:30:08,148 --> 00:30:10,064
You don't know if you can trust me

181
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,842
What's so special about Kei?

182
00:30:16,325 --> 00:30:17,944
Why did Himiko take her?

183
00:30:19,357 --> 00:30:21,006
Kei is just a kid.

184
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:24,408
It is my fault,
I should have expected it.

185
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:27,221
Ever since she's been on the run,
I've been like a mother to her

186
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,175
Reiko, you stay here.

187
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:44,584
You have to protect them.

188
00:30:44,657 --> 00:30:46,396
And as for Kei ...

189
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:51,890
I will follow them and try to save her.

190
00:30:52,551 --> 00:30:54,189
- It will be the best thing.
- But ...?

191
00:30:56,401 --> 00:30:58,221
You stay here too!

192
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:00,586
Whatever happens
I still will not trust you.

193
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:04,004
Hey!

194
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:13,784
Reiko? Where is Ryo?

195
00:32:14,384 --> 00:32:16,827
I thought he was with you?

196
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:47,719
Will that letter help you find Kei?

197
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,087
I don't know.

198
00:32:50,203 --> 00:32:52,756
Do you realise? It could be a trap.

199
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:54,587
Do you think so?

200
00:32:56,352 --> 00:32:58,064
Then you'd better turn back.

201
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:01,673
No way.
Your sister kidnapped Kei.

202
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:03,941
So I don't trust you either.

203
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:22,334
Why don't we do the next step?

204
00:33:26,696 --> 00:33:29,283
First clean off all that blood.

205
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:32,812
You're a mess.

206
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,249
To resurrect your parents
we need your blood as well as mine.

207
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:51,371
Let's do it.

208
00:33:53,304 --> 00:33:55,015
Why the rush?

209
00:33:56,296 --> 00:33:59,528
We must wait until your
Imichi blood becomes more powerful.

210
00:33:59,881 --> 00:34:01,930
Then we'll do the ritual.

211
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,582
It shouldn't take too long.

212
00:34:09,186 --> 00:34:10,920
It'll be soon...

213
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:14,045
I promise.

214
00:35:04,964 --> 00:35:07,858
- I didn't need your help.
- I did not do it for you.

215
00:35:11,492 --> 00:35:13,703
What is the Imichi?

216
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:18,818
It is a wicked blood.

217
00:35:20,662 --> 00:35:22,910
Saki and I have it.

218
00:35:26,913 --> 00:35:28,792
If I come into contact with blood ...

219
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:30,581
... I lose control.

220
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:36,257
If that happens...

221
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:38,751
... I might even try to kill you.

222
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,217
So it would be safer if you stayed
away from me.

223
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,599
Does Kei have Imichi blood?

224
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:02,056
Almost certainly.

225
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:07,033
This is the place indicated on your map?

226
00:38:11,047 --> 00:38:12,707
Anyone who enters ...

227
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,820
... does not come out alive.

228
00:41:04,998 --> 00:41:06,101
Aya!

229
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:08,601
Aya! Aya!

230
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,513
What's the story?

231
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,164
With so much blood I will lose control.

232
00:42:31,429 --> 00:42:34,684
Go away! Get away from me!

233
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,302
Aya!
Help!

234
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:54,964
Ryo!

235
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,495
We appreciate ...

236
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:32,999
... that everything has gone well.

237
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:14,893
Blood is my elixir
to live forever.

238
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:42,527
Ryo!

239
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:41,417
Aya.

240
00:46:56,378 --> 00:46:57,828
Are you OK?

241
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:02,506
I thought that you were dead.

242
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,078
You have saved me.

243
00:47:14,448 --> 00:47:15,673
Thank you.

244
00:47:26,531 --> 00:47:28,304
I don't know what it is.

245
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,568
It's interesting.

246
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,164
When I am next to you...

247
00:47:40,641 --> 00:47:43,033
... my Imichi blood is not out of control.

248
00:47:54,399 --> 00:47:55,921
There is another room...

249
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:57,960
... that we must inspect.

250
00:48:06,923 --> 00:48:07,931
Aya.

251
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:11,776
If something happens to me ...

252
00:48:13,775 --> 00:48:15,494
I want you to avenge me ...

253
00:48:16,043 --> 00:48:17,965
for the death of my brother.

254
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:22,240
I am grateful that you trust me now

255
00:48:24,562 --> 00:48:26,609
You want to save Kei, right?

256
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:29,481
I can be helpful.

257
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,818
If they catch me, you should continue.

258
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:41,133
To know the limit
of our capacity...

259
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,212
... is not that simple, is it?

260
00:48:49,905 --> 00:48:52,595
I can't even control myself.

261
00:48:55,414 --> 00:48:57,208
He asked what I am.

262
00:49:29,172 --> 00:49:30,784
Kei is not here.

263
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:34,578
Saki.

264
00:49:36,672 --> 00:49:38,154
I knew ...

265
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:41,353
... that you would come.

266
00:49:42,903 --> 00:49:44,518
Where is the girl?

267
00:49:45,888 --> 00:49:47,545
She is with Himiko.

268
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:49,900
Do not worry.

269
00:49:50,137 --> 00:49:52,690
She won't suffer much longer.

270
00:49:54,416 --> 00:49:56,624
I will bring her when
everything has finished.

271
00:49:57,477 --> 00:50:00,925
I don't care if its finished ...
Bring her now!

272
00:50:01,908 --> 00:50:03,195
You're right.

273
00:50:03,604 --> 00:50:05,412
We should end all this.

274
00:50:06,229 --> 00:50:07,662
I just want ...

275
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:11,498
... everything to be like before.

276
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:14,309
I mean, that we will all
be together again.

277
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,851
You do not know what you're doing!

278
00:50:19,164 --> 00:50:20,559
I just want ...

279
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:22,213
... to see them again.

280
00:50:25,575 --> 00:50:26,893
I want us all ...

281
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:28,982
to be alive together

282
00:50:40,753 --> 00:50:43,246
That's why I'm helping Himiko
with her search.

283
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,197
She needs the powerful Imichi blood.

284
00:50:50,503 --> 00:50:52,450
Our blood will be
strong enough.

285
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:54,445
Incredible!
You would really do it?

286
00:50:55,477 --> 00:50:56,844
You would like ...

287
00:50:57,327 --> 00:50:59,105
... to see them again too, right?

288
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:01,409
Or would your ...

289
00:51:02,018 --> 00:51:04,501
... stepmother mind?

290
00:51:10,695 --> 00:51:12,938
You're crazy if you trust Himiko.

291
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:17,530
It was her that murdered our parents!

292
00:51:19,428 --> 00:51:21,187
You don't understand.

293
00:51:40,952 --> 00:51:43,360
If we kill Himiko,
we can't return them from the dead.

294
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,056
But with her formula, perhaps
we can create an antidote.

295
00:51:54,574 --> 00:51:56,615
If you trust in me, allow me to do it.

296
00:51:57,676 --> 00:52:00,999
While helping my parents,
I will bring Kei back.

297
00:52:02,032 --> 00:52:05,658
Have you forgotten what we've become?

298
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:09,153
We're fighting to
stop this madness!

299
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:15,611
Our parents do not
deserve to return to life this way.

300
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:22,901
Then I will have to kill you...

301
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:25,428
... to be able to resurrect you.

302
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:28,791
Saki!

303
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:12,793
They are not
adversaries either!

304
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:18,871
Aya!

305
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,912
Excuse me, Aya.

306
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,103
Somehow I have
absorbed some of your strength.

307
00:55:19,762 --> 00:55:21,520
I don't know how it happened.

308
00:55:25,464 --> 00:55:27,106
You must
have the ability ...

309
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:30,907
... to neutralize
the Imichi force.

310
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:52,926
You said...

311
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:56,569
... its possible that Kei
also has Imichi blood.

312
00:56:03,596 --> 00:56:04,981
I remember ...

313
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:07,508
... when Kei was very small.

314
00:56:08,481 --> 00:56:11,196
She came into contact
with the blood of an animal.

315
00:56:15,245 --> 00:56:18,811
When I found her she was out of control,
it was quite difficult.

316
00:56:22,118 --> 00:56:23,770
But it was clear ...

317
00:56:24,205 --> 00:56:26,721
... that this girl was
something special for me.

318
00:56:28,905 --> 00:56:31,728
That's the reason
I was always at her side.

319
00:56:39,766 --> 00:56:41,613
It has to be your blood.

320
00:56:43,373 --> 00:56:45,940
Your blood and hers share the same destiny.

321
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:50,160
You should rest.

322
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:39,047
What's happening?
It's too quiet!

323
00:57:42,344 --> 00:57:44,424
All the zombies are gone.

324
00:57:45,139 --> 00:57:46,845
This is very strange.

325
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,064
Do you hear?

326
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:47,925
Why doesn't it shine?

327
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,551
I thought ...

328
01:01:01,003 --> 01:01:03,263
I had killed all her protectors.

329
01:01:05,127 --> 01:01:07,072
But still some remain!

330
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:08,476
There you are!

331
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,568
Himiko!

332
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:18,673
Do you not recognize me?

333
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:19,998
Aya.

334
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:22,789
Misery.

335
01:01:25,182 --> 01:01:26,404
Aya.

336
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:28,786
Come with me.

337
01:01:31,446 --> 01:01:34,990
Together we will create a world
for eternity.

338
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,112
This is madness!

339
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:41,331
Only those who are on my side ...

340
01:01:42,254 --> 01:01:44,998
... deserve to live.

341
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:49,717
Think about it.

342
01:01:50,494 --> 01:01:52,271
Your father ...

343
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,045
... and your mother.

344
01:01:55,017 --> 01:02:00,247
... we could return them to life,
even resurrect the children.

345
01:02:02,391 --> 01:02:06,077
If you had not cheated us,
they would still be alive!

346
01:02:06,752 --> 01:02:08,263
You have chosen badly!

347
01:02:09,565 --> 01:02:10,854
I understand.

348
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,490
Get them!

349
01:03:52,964 --> 01:03:54,643
The elixir is ready

350
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:58,562
Now I will have eternal life ...

351
01:03:59,053 --> 01:04:01,809
... I won't have to be afraid of anything.

352
01:04:30,914 --> 01:04:32,344
Let go of me!

353
01:04:35,010 --> 01:04:37,882
I knew that you would betray me.

354
01:08:32,596 --> 01:08:35,090
I don't need Imichi blood any more.

355
01:08:38,225 --> 01:08:39,999
You're the last of your clan.

356
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,513
Your lineage dies with you.

357
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:14,376
Is that all?

358
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,817
It will not be easy for you.

359
01:09:30,656 --> 01:09:31,766
Hey!

360
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:35,957
Saki!

361
01:09:47,295 --> 01:09:48,521
Sorry.

362
01:09:50,323 --> 01:09:51,436
I know...

363
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:53,319
.. I did wrong.

364
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:57,972
I just wanted to resurrect them

365
01:10:00,184 --> 01:10:01,396
You see!

366
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:03,613
It was all part of the plan.

367
01:10:04,089 --> 01:10:05,639
All this.

368
01:10:06,527 --> 01:10:09,018
And also my immortality.

369
01:10:11,015 --> 01:10:13,291
I will be the Queen of the dark kingdom!

370
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,266
Not you!

371
01:10:19,314 --> 01:10:22,915
Are you still thinking about being on
the good side?

372
01:10:24,635 --> 01:10:28,153
Sorry, but the situation
has changed.

373
01:10:29,116 --> 01:10:30,889
Now you are the bad guys!

374
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:13,080
Kei!

375
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:15,570
I'm here.

376
01:14:37,482 --> 01:14:42,234
An Imichi like you doesn't mean
anything to me.

377
01:14:48,771 --> 01:14:49,909
Kei.

378
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,037
Take care of yourself and others, right?

379
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:35,646
- Kei!
- Kei!

380
01:17:39,556 --> 01:17:41,234
Aya, listen

381
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:46,073
Can you avenge Ryo for me?

382
01:19:04,165 --> 01:19:06,758
Himiko!
